               CHAPTER I. 
               THERE is a glitter and a fragrance in the mere name of the South, which are associated with sunny skies and exuberant vegetation. Like a Nile of the new world the Mississippi pours its vast stream; it is bordered by bluffs, that are pyramids of God's own making; and in their soil repose chieftains, that have never been tyrants, surrounded by warriors, that have never been slaves. 
               These exquisitely German reflections passed through the mind of Louis Welland, as the steamer Powhattan, on which he was a passenger, approached the wharves of Memphis. It was precisely the most inappropriate propriate time in the world to indulge in reflections. He should have looked after his baggage. For the baggage room was inundated by sharp Yankees and gentlemanly blacklegs, who took their pick of "the goods the Gods provided," without reference to human institutions of proprietorship and entirely regardless of the protests of the sable baggage master. 
               But, while this went on below, Welland stood upon the deck, contemplating in rapture the gorgeous skies, that were steeped in the mellow colors of evening, and the busy town, which lay in a ring of country, "exceeding fair to see." To some extent all Germans are poets, and to some extent all poets are fools. Fools in the practical dollar and cent life, though princes of wisdom in the realms of the soul. Full of ideals, they never realize the wickedness of the actual world, and though this may be folly, it is happiness. Thus, Louis Welland was far from supposing that one person carried off his umbrella, while another appropriated his books; yet such was the case. And when be finally stepped ashore, it was not with reminiscences of the magnificent river and the luminous skies but with regrets for the lost property. 
               A negro, the color of a well used saddle, and, who might have been one, for any evidence to the contrary offered by the olfactories, proffered his services for the transport of the rest of his baggage. They were accepted. Under his guidance Welland arrived rived at the Metropolitan Hotel, and was safely put in possession of a room with poky furniture, a stuffy bed, and an atmosphere stiflingly hot. The evidences of the last lodger's ablutions were still visible in the wash-basin, and cigar ashes diversified the monotony of the mantle-shelf. 
               While the young man opens his trunk, and attends to the duties of the petite toilet, which, with people of breeding, precedes each meal, we will furnish the reader with a sketch of his outward appearance. 
               A little above the medium height, with the chest of a Hercules, and the waist of a lieutenant of the guards, Welland had that elegance of appearance, which results from perfect symmetry of form. An elegance that, be it casually observed, is inborn and can never be acquired. His face proved that his descent was not purely Teutonic, but that there mingled with his blood a Southern or Eastern current. We have all seen those faces, and no one who has ever admired the beauty of the men of Lombardy, will find it difficult to recall them. Features of classic regularity, with the thin straight nose and transparent nostrils that bespeak the pride of the Devil, and the broad beautiful brow, that beams with the loftiness of an angel. A complexion of a pure dead white, rarely disturbed by the faintest blush imaginable; deep dark eyes; eyebrows as if drawn in ink; wavy curls of black hair; and a full sensuous mouth, surmounted by a small dark moustache. Having given the final polish to hands long and white as those of a woman, he descended to the supper table. 
               Who has not seen the feeding of the free and great American, at the tables of the caravansaries that accommodate our traveling public? Who has not observed the process, by which the greatest possible amount of food is, in the least possible time, transferred from the plate to the stomach of the mightiest nation on the globe? We all have, and therefore we can all imagine the scene upon which Welland entered. Eating slow-for he was Epicurean in his tastes, by right of his double descent-he found himself at last left alone at table with another gentleman. This was a hale hearty man, one of those stout gents that always have small bright blue eyes, a large nose, and gray hair enough sprinkled about, to give an air of infinite respectability to the countenance. 
               "We are left in possession," remarked he of the stout figure, nodding good humoredly to Welland. 
               "Of what they do not want," replied Welland, who was surrounded with bastions of emptied dishes. 
               "Oh yes, it is a perfect game of grab here at every meal," said the stranger. 
               "A fit type of the life, I suppose." 
               "You are an observer it seems, and perhaps a thinker." 
               "Both to such an extent that I did not observe my books being carried off when I landed, and forgot the habits of the American when I delayed descending to supper." 
               "By your opinions and language I Judge you to be a German. Is it so? Few Americans pronounce English with the exactness, which well bred Europeans are in the habit of using." 
               "You have judged correctly. Are you a German?" 
               "I am, but not a University man. I have therefore acquired the patois of the country with more facility." 
               Welland smiled. "Is it indiscreet to inquire whether you live here." 
               "Not at all. I live here and do business on a considerable scale. My name is Reichenau." 
               "Thank you. My name is Welland, and I have come here to accept of position as Surveyor from the State Government." 
               They rose and walked the veranda, for a half hour or so conversing on different subjects. 
               It was in June 1860, and the causes that finally produced the great Rebellion, were even then apparent to the observing mind. People are mistaken in believing that the late war was an affair long anticipated, and prepared for by the South. To us it has always borne the character of a spontaneous popular outburst, which, in its magnitude and duration proved how immense, and how deeply rooted the popular antipathies were. It was not difficult then, to find matter for conversation, and the two men finally parted with mutual good will. 
                
               It was late in the evening. Welland had thrown away the book which he had been reading. Sunk in meditation, the events of his past life were conjured up in turn, and gladdened or saddened him, as the aspect was gay or sorrowful. 
               He seemed to gaze into a large garden glowing; in the mellow afternoon light. There was an old and blackened board fence, upon which the heavy leafed vines clambered and hung, and there was a broad border of starry forget-me-nots around the garden. The apple and pear trees waved their branches, and rose bushes hung over the walks, heavy with fragrant blossoms. A lady armed with scissors was gathering a magnificent boquet, and a bright boy carried the basket, which received the culled flowers. The lady was his mother, the boy himself. 
               And the picture changed. There was a wide plain all covered with snow; at one end an enclosure made by a low stone wall, upon the top of which lay glittering pyramids of ice. The inclosure was dotted with tomb-stones, that were brilliant in a fringe-work of icicles. In a corner yawned an open grave, black and dismal. The boy stood there weeping bitterly, and Supported by a tall stern man, his uncle. The wind moaned, and the trees shivered. They were burying his mother. 
               Still another picture. A long low room brightly illuminated. Queerly painted shields and banners hung from the walls. A table divided the entire length of the apartment, and around it were seated students, in all the fantastic garbs of German University fraternities. They were holding high carousal. At the head of the table stood a young man in whom the resemblance to Welland was evident, and with the rapier in one hand and a cup in the other he proposed a toast. Loud cheers followed. 
               Again a change. Under the trees of the green forest, with the blue sky and the moon high above them, a number of men grouped around a fire. Some were provided with good cloaks, others were in tatters. All had arms, and though there were but few muskets, there was no lack of scythes and iron bars. The leader stood close to the fire, leaning upon his sabre. It was Welland, a captain in the Revolutionary army of 1848. They have been sent on a special errand by General Miroslawsky; they were to intercept a party of soldiers, guarding treasure belonging to government. Now the bell of the neighboring village rings out eleven o'clock, and the leader gives the signal to advance. The fire is extinguished, and the figures disappear in the darkness of the forest. But not for long. There is a road winds through these woods, with the moon gleaming white on its long and dusty trail. Tramp, tramp, advances the guard, with their muskets at shoulder, and the cart laden with treasure in their midst. A shot, and then another! A wild hurrah, and a furious attack! The soldiery has been cut down or driven off, and the treasure, claimed as public property by the Revolutionary Army, has been secured. Captain Welland has done well. 
               And the saddest of changes. The loss of the money-the dishonoring suspicion-the flight through Switzerland-the confiscation of his patrimony to refund Government-the life in New York-the struggle and the combat with the realities of a world not dreamt of at University-All these Welland waved away, as he leapt up, and rushed to the window, to dispel his dreams and quiet his mind, by a vision of the calm still night. And behold, the Mississippi flowed in undying beauty and grandeur, and the constellations of another hemisphere smiled upon him from the tent of heaven. 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               WELLAND could not remain in the dingy apartment, but opened a door which led to the veranda that encircles each story of a Southern building. Here the air was cool, and the breeze that fanned his brow was laden with the sweet breath of the woods beyond the river; it was fragrant with the odor of the starry dogwood, the intoxicating azaleas, and the golden jessamines. Deceptive pleasure! Upon the wings of the Southern evening breeze are borne not only the perfumes of flowers, but also the emanations of marshes and swamps, that creep into the blood, and poison life. It salutes the stranger with the kiss of a Syren, sweet but fatal. 
               Proceeding on the veranda our friend passed completely around the house. At first, he was too much absorbed by his reflections, to pay attention to external objects. But when he made the circuit for the third and fourth time, it was impossible to avoid noticing an open door, from which streamed a mass of light, on that side of the house, opposite to the one in which his room was situated. When he passed for the fifth time, he looked in. It was one of the private parlors of the hotel, furnished in a plain and elegant manner. Four jets of gas threw a brilliant light on a group of young men, who were seated around a table in the center. Empty bottles on a stand gave evidence of the humor of the party. As Welland again passed, his nervous irritation, which made solitude irksome, prompted him to enter. He conceived it to be a public room. The well bred stare, which was occasioned by his intrusion, informed him otherwise. 
               "Accept my apologies," said he, preparing to retreat, "I thought this a public room." 
               "Pray, consider it so," replied one of the young men with ready courtesy. "We shall be happy to have your company." 
               It was said with such a charming air of affability, that Welland took the proffered seat, and made one of the circle. 
                
               "Will you join our game, or remain a looker on?" inquired the young man, upon whom Welland's appearance had made a favorable impression. 
               "The latter if you please," replied he. "I owe you thanks for your invitation, for I am in a mood, when solitude is unbearable." 
               The young man bowed. "You will at least accept a glass of wine? You know that the first promptings of our Southern hospitality are to ask a stranger to drink." 
               "I will gladly drink with you." 
               Glasses were filled, and clinked in the French manner, and then the party, which consisted of four, resumed their game, while Welland became a spectator. These young men had quietly recognized each other by the Free Masonry of good society, and found further introduction or inquiry after names superfluous. 
               They were playing Brag. Brag is an exquisitely Western game. It is the life on, the prairies symbolized in cards. It is the daring of the pioneer expressed in a game. The principle that he, whose finger is first on the trigger, is the best man, obtains in Brag as well as in pioneer life. The staking of everything upon one's own courage, or rather upon the intimidation of the opponent, is the prominent feature of this game, as well as of other undertakings in the far West. 
               Fortune has little to do with this game. A temerity that prompts one to risk all; a countenance of marble that changes not; an eye steady, and observant; a voice quiet and firm; and a readiness to resort to revolver and bowie knife;-these are the conditions of winning at Brag, and making a fortune in the far West. 
               It is not surprising that this game is as popular in the Western wild, as Rouge et Noir is at the centers of civilization. The savage and the exhausted man of the world require both the most maddening excitement. The Indian drinks Alcohol, and so does the refined toper, on whose palate the mellow wines have lost their taste. Half tints of pleasure, and moderate phases of excitement are deemed sufficient by neither. 
               They had been staking moderate sums, and played with various success, when a step approached the door, and another entered. 
               "Excuse me gentlemen," said the new comer, "but I can never resist offering to join a party, when they are playing cards," and he moved a chair to the table. 
               It was evident the company was a little discomposed, by this unceremonious method of introduction, but they were too well bred to urge objections. 
               "Will you take a hand," asked the dealer, as he shuffled the cards and prepared to deal them. 
               "Certainly Sir, take it, and bet on it too," returned the stranger with complacency. 
               He must have been thirty five or forty years of age. Somebody has sald, that every human countenance, with a little exaggeration, may be brought to present a striking likeness to the face of some animal. This principle applied in the present case, would bring the stranger in the category of weasels, with a shade of the fox. An idea of subtility and cunning was inseparable from the features. 
               The game underwent a change. The light hearted company of Southern planters, or planters' sons-for such they were-seemed at once animated, not by a desire for amusement as before, but by a thirst for gain. Betting rose. Eyes grew large and feverish, and bright hectic flushes dabbled the sallow cheeks. The money was insufficient, and memorandum notes were scrawled hastily, and staked. The stranger seemed to infuse a new spirit into the game. 
               It was certainly to his advantage. A heap of notes attested his success in betting, and more than one of the scrawled certificates of indebtedness had found its way to his pocket. It seemed a pitched battle between him and the young man, who had welcomed Welland so cordially. It is true, the young man was his own master, and could therefore bet with more impunity than the others. But the battle always ended in favor of the stranger. 
               Welland was exceedingly attentive. An impression obtained in his mind, that he had seen the stranger somewhere, long years ago. Still he could not place him; but the more he endeavored to rid himself of the idea, the stronger grew the feeling of deep distrust he entertained towards this person. He was recalled from his dreams by the excited voices of the players. 
               "Five thousand on my hand," cried the planter. 
               "And one thousand better," replied the stranger, coolly. 
               "Four thousand better," rejoined the planter, excitedly, as he threw a demand note for ten thousand dollars on the table. 
               "And ten thousand better," said the stranger, drawing a roll of thousand dollar bills from his pocket. 
               "I can't risk it," sighed his opponent. But Welland who had watched the stranger narrowly, whispered: 
               "Call him, at my risk." 
               The planter obeyed. The hands were shown out. He had three tens; the stranger laid down his cards, and behold-Three Queens! 
               Then occurred a remarkable thing. As the stranger displayed his cards, Welland by a sudden movement, as irresistible as it was unexpected, struck his hand to the table, and with such force, that it was paralyzed for a moment; at the same instant, with the dexterity of a juggler, he extricated two cards from his sleeve, and exhibited them to the company. 
               There was a pause of deep surprise, followed by a burst of fury. 
                
               "Cheat! Blackleg! Scoundrel!" were the epithets, which fell like hail on the head of the offender. 
               But the planter who had bet so high, seized him by the collar, and said in a deep voice, frigid with restrained rage: 
               "Deliver up every note, and every cent you have won here to-night." 
               The man assumed a sullen look and hesitated. 
               "Do you hear me, scoundrel?" roared the planter shaking him as a tiger might worry a fox. 
               "I am sure you speak loud enough," returned the other; "and if you will leave off throttling me, I will restore all I won honestly, because in one game where I tried to trick you, I had the misfortune to be discovered." 
               "You dirty dog! You deserve to be lashed with a cowhide within an inch of your life!" 
               "If all men were to receive their deserts, how many of you would escape punishment?" 
               "By Jove the rogue grows philosophical. Have you all got back your notes and money?" 
               All said they had. 
               "And here are mine. Now we come to another chapter. Whom did you defraud of the money you exhibited here to-night? Confess?" 
               "You are master of the situation, it is true," said the gambler, sullenly, "but this does not entitle you to inquire where my money came from. It is mine, or not mine, as it happens. But it is in my profession, and there is no one I have played Brag with, in the State of Tennessee, besides you." 
               "Let this suffice," urged Welland, who had now recognized the stranger. "Let him go, my dear Sir, and leave to the police the task of punishing cheats." 
               "As you wish it-certainly," replied the planter. "Let me express our gratitude for the service you have rendered to-night, and for myself let me request a continuance of the acquaintance. May I call upon you to-morrow morning?" 
               "I shall be happy to see you." 
               The gambler in the meanwhile had disappeared. After finishing another bottle of wine, which somewhat restored the spirits of the party, the young men bid each other good night, and retired to their respective apartments. 
             
             
               CHAPTER III. 
               IT was soon after breakfast next morning, that Welland made his way to the office of the State official, through whom he had received his appointment, and under whose direction he was to work. The engagement was ratified in all respects, and to the great satisfaction of the young man. But the work he was put upon would take him to a distant part of Tennessee. He was to survey the north eastern border of the state, especially Claiborne County. Welland was not sorry for this, as his long sojourn in a city like New York had created a longing for the country with its green woods, fresh fields, and clear skies. This longing, be it casually observed, is a petted feeling among townfolks, who fain imagine that they would delight in endless sojourns in the country, and never get tired of the woods, the skies, and the wild flowers. No delusion is more fascinating, and more transient. Town habits and town acquaintances may bore us occasionally, but there is no bore so utterly unbearable as the country, and the magnificent still-life of nature, after the novelty of first acquaintance has worn off. 
               Having received his instructions, the young man returned to the hotel, and had scarce entered his apartment, when the waiter followed him and delivered a card. 
               "The gentleman is in the parlor," said he, in reply to Welland's look of inquiry. 
               The card bore the name of: 
                     Frank Courtelotte, Claiborne County.
                  
                
               Upon the reverse was written; Begs to renew the acquaintance of last evening. 
               Welland was highly pleased with this mark of attention, and descended immediately to welcome the caller. 
               It was the planter of the evening before. Frank Tourtelotte, as his name shows, was the descendant of a French family of Louisiana, which by some chance or other had in the course of years been transplanted to Tennessee. They possessed extensive estates in Claiborne county. Frank, who had been educated in Louisiana, possessed all the grace of French manners, with all the fanciful noblesse that is a special attribute of the Gallic nation. These qualities were tempered however by good practical common sense, and a little of Western ferocity. He was tall and slim, with a brunette complexion, and eyes and hair to suit. The features were good, and the lips of a remarkably bright vermillion. As in all French faces nobility of features and capacity of expression constituted the chief charm. 
               "How have you slept?" inquired Mr. Tourtelotte, meeting Welland with an extended palm. 
               "Quite well, thank you. And you?" 
               "Much the better for your interference last night. I could ill have afforded to lose twenty thousand dollars at this time." 
               "The loss can not be indifferent at any moment," replied Welland, "especially in such a cause." 
               "I bow to your Northern prejudices. Brag is certainly a game of maddening excitement. But we Southerners drain every cup of pleasure to the dregs, instead of sipping, and making it last a life time, as you do." 
               Welland merely assented, preferring not to enter into a discussion of the differences between the two sections. 
               Tourtelotte understood the other's reserve, and changed the topic of conversation. 
               "How was it possible for you to detect the cheating of that rascal? I thought I had observed him pretty closely, but could see nothing amiss." 
               "By simply looking at his hands, instead of his eyes. In Brag such close observation of faces seems necessary, that the player has no leisure to follow the movements of the hand. Is a cheat so accomplished, that he can execute motions of the fingers without showing the least consciousness thereof in his face and eyes, it becomes easy to fleece his victims." 
               "What you say has an air of probability. Do you know that he waited on me this morning, and apologized?" 
               "Indeed? What impertinence!" 
               "Yes, it was rather cool. The fellow claims that the money he played with, is part of the funds of a political Committee in this state. He is employed by the party in question, and rather poor, and the temptation of realizing something for himself, was evidently too much for his conscience." 
               "You take a kind view of the subject. I have seen the fellow before." 
               "You have?" Why did you not mention it? Am I permitted to ask whether it was under similar circumstances?" 
               "Not exactly. It was in the Revolution." 
               "In the Revolution?" 
                
               "Of the year 1848. In Germany. I was captain of a company of soldiers, if the ill-assorted mob of students and peasants, idealists and plunderers which composed it, are entitled to the name." 
               "And this man was in your company?" 
               "He was my lieutenant. His disappearance was connected with a singular circumstance." 
               "I am encroaching on private matters, and subjects that pain you. Pray forgive me," said Tourtelotte, and with a motion fall of grace he took Welland's hand. "But, if you knew how deep an interest I take in you!" 
               "Thank you. This is a painful circumstance to me. I was in charge of money plundered from the War Fund of the Enemy, which disappeared suddenly. But I will not attach suspicion to any one, for, our cause was falling, and every body looked for safety in flight. These are old-world affairs that I am telling you. That Revolution is scarce remembered in this country." 
               "You are right. Let the past take care of its sorrows." 
               "But their spirits will not vanish from memory." 
               "There is a patent spell to lay them: Pleasure." 
               "For the rich and the idle. For the poor and the thinker there is another." 
               "And that is?" 
               "Work." 
                
               Tourtelotte shrugged his shoulders. "In this section where we delegate labor to the negro, your spell has not the noble sound it would bear in New York, with Astors and Vanderbilts to attest its success." 
               "Perhaps. Still the gardner enjoys more pleasure in tending his trees and seeing the fruit develop, than the Sybarite in eating it." 
               "It may be. But the latter does not pay the price of labor for his enjoyment. However we have gotten upon the old social question of labor versus capital, they call it in this country-of idleness versus drudgery I name it. You are a stranger here?" 
               "I am. I have accepted the post of surveyor, and am directed to go to Claiborne County, and begin my labors there." 
               "Capital, we shall be neighbors." 
               "I perceive that you reside in the same county." 
               "I shall have the happiness of introducing you to my friends." 
               "Thanks," cried Welland, while a glow of pleasure spread over his countenance. 
               "I shall not then remain a stranger in the wilds of Tennessee." 
               "You shall certainly not remain a stranger in Claiborne County. As for the wilds of Tennessee, they are not to be found in that locality." 
               "I beg your pardon," said Welland, with a noble expression of humility and a bow to Tourtelotte. "I might have imagined what sort of wilds there were in Claiborne borne County, from the specimen of its savage inhabitants I have been so fortunate to become acquainted with." 
               Tourtelotte bowed gracefully, in return for the compliment. 
               "I am Compelled to remain in Memphis yet awhile. When do you set out?" 
               "To-morrow, if possible." 
               "You must let me perform my duty by letter then, I shall be pleased if you will accept of a letter of introduction to my next neighbors, the Goldmans. Their plantation adjoins mine, and I feel quite at home with them, because they have more appreciation for my French tastes than the rest of my friends. As a further recommendation, I may mention that the old people are Germans born." 
               "The old people?" inquired Welland. 
               "Yes Mr. and Mrs. Goldman. Miss Goldman and her brother were born in New Orleans and are Creoles in taste, appearance and manner. The brother is now traveling but Miss Goldman is at home." 
               There was a hesitation in his manner when he mentioned Miss Goldman, and an earnest look in his eyes, which left little doubt of the nature of his feeling toward the young lady. 
               "I am much obliged. You are truly kind." 
               "I should be to one who has saved me twenty thousand dollars." 
               "If it be a mere sense of my claims to your gratitude, I beg you to forget it," replied Welland, proudly. 
                
               "Your pardon! It was coarsely expressed. Honor me with your friendship, and I will try to deserve it." 
               Welland merely pressed the hand of the enthusiastic Tourtelotte, and then excused himself on the plea of having to prepare for his departure. 
               They appointed a meeting for the evening when Tourtelotte offered to have the letter of introduction ready. Then the young men parted with great cordiality. 
               As Welland entered his room a man followed him. He turned and discovered the gambler of the night before. Frowning he drew himself up and said: 
               "Sir?" 
               "I beg your pardon if the moment is ill-chosen," said the stranger, glibly. "But I must have some conversation with you." 
               "Must," repeated Welland. "And after the scene of yesterday evening?" 
               "Precisely," returned the stranger. "You have been the cause of my losing more than twenty five thousand dollars, and have damaged my character in addition." 
               "One moment. The money was never yours, and the character was gone, before I made its condition public." 
               "That is a mere quibble. You have ruined me." 
               "Have I? What then?" 
               "What then?" cried the gambler, furiously. But Welland immediately collared him, and said: 
                
               "Speak in this tone, fellow, and I'll throw you out of the window." 
               It was certainly no very fearful threat, for the window opened on the verandah. Still it seemed to have its effect, for the gambler rejoined in a humble voice. 
               "Still so proud and passionate, Captain Welland! We have known each other before." 
               "Dare you allude to a connection that ended as ours did?" 
               "I must. Let us make a treaty, Sir. Let me alone. Dont interfere with me, and I wont trouble you. I came here to say that to you." 
               "You wont trouble me? You are very kind." 
               "Don't imagine yourself so impregnable, Mr. Welland. You are a man of honor, a man whom shame like that which fell on me last night would kill." 
               "You deign to be complimentary," said Welland, with a sneer of ineffable scorn. 
               "Not at all. For honor is a weakness." 
               "Which you have conquered." 
               "I have. But you have not. If therefore I should hint about the loss of certain moneys in your Charge during the Revolutionary war of 1848, and about the suspicions this gave rise to, it might damage your character pretty extensively; especially as you could not deny the fact, nor at this distant period bring any explanatory evidence." 
               "And what would it all amount to?" 
                
               "Not much to me if I were in your case, but a good deal to you. I would snap my fingers at people, but you would shrink from the whispering tongue and the averted eye, and suffer under the cold stare of suspicious minds." 
               Welland approached him and laid his hand upon his shoulder. "Hassel," he said, "Hassel--" 
               "Hazelton, if you please, for that is my name now." 
               "Hazelton," repeated Welland, "you were once a student-you belonged to a fraternity-you fought for liberty and right. I will not, can not believe, that you are sunk so deeply in the moral scale, as you profess to be. It is impossible for a man, that once nourished the aspirations which animated you, to become a scoundrel, and live by cheating his fellows." 
               A tremor passed over Hassel's features. His eyes were cast down. "Welland," he said, in a choked voice, "a man with a firm control of his passions, like you, knows not what love of pleasure, and extravagant habits may make of one, who has a vague idea of honor, and who had been cut adrift by all he ever cared for." 
               "Cut adrift by all he ever cared for?" Had you not parents, that were wrapped up in you?" 
               He lifted his eyes gloomily. "My father is an old official, and his father was an official before him. Loyalty to his King is with my father, the duty next to obedience to God. When I joined the revolutionary army, both my parents renounced me, nor have I heard of them since." 
               "And Ernestine? She, whom you loved so passionately? Was the memory of that love not sufficient to keep you honest? Can a man who loves, become a scoundrel?" 
               Hassel's eyes grew heavy with tears. "You tear my heart," he said. "The picture of that sweet angel is my only consolation, and that she has loved me, is the redeeming point in my history." 
               "Is she dead then?" Welland asked, deeply touched. 
               "Dead to me. Oh, that I were dead too!" 
               "No, Hassel. There is good in you yet. It is carelessness, and shiftlessness that have made you a cheat, not love of crime, or a mean heart. Reform, work, and live by honest means." 
               "It is too late," replied the other, regaining his former composure. "I am just as shiftless, and as careless, and as extravagant, and as pleasure-loving as ever. The same qualities would again bring about my fall. Let me alone. Give me up as a lost soul." 
               "But you can redeem all, if you only will." 
               "Well then, I will not. Filial affection, love, honor, a student's aspirations, and a patriot's hopes, I have thrown them all into the ocean, when I left Europe." 
               "Don't say so, Hassel." 
                
               "Call me Hazelton, and let us return to the subject in hand. Will you let me alone, and when we do meet, treat me as you would any stranger?" 
               "I shall try to avoid you, because I shrink from seeing your degradation. Keep out of my path, and I will try to forget you." 
               "That is all I ask. But if you disturb me, remember, that all means are legal in self-defence." 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               Welland had been surveying for two weeks in the North-eastern part of the State, in Union and Green Counties. Granting himself a few days respite from his labors, he resolved to ride into Claiborne County, and deliver his letter of introduction to the Goldmans. 
               It was an afternoon's ride through hilly country, that abounded in picturesque scenery. The heights were covered with the juniper and the red ash. Long stretches of pine woods extended into the valleys, being, as it were, the skirts of the immense pine forests of North Carolina, dragging over into Tennessee. He crossed the Clinch River by one of the few fords, and passed the town of Sycamore, leaving it to the right. It was about two hours before sundown, that he reached the mansion house of the Goldmans. 
               A brick building of moderate extent, it had recently been much enlarged by the addition of wings, constructed by the stone found in that region. The spurs of the Alleghanies in the north-eastern part of the State are rich in stone, and possess even quarries of fair marble. The newer parts of the building had been constructed in elegant modern style, with long French windows, balconies, and architectural ornaments, that testified more to the builder's love of display than to his correctness of taste. The approaches to the house were well shaded, and a second garden extended in the rear. 
               Welland gave his horse in charge of a negro who lounged on the hall steps, and entered the building. A short, stout gentleman met him, and shook his hand heartily. In a moment he was brought into the parlor. This was an airy and elegantly furnished apartment. A lady reposing in a huge chair lifted her head languidly, as he entered. 
               Welland introduced himself, and delivered his letter. The gentleman glanced at it, but said that their friend Tourtelotte had already informed them, by mail, of the pleasure they would experience in becoming acquainted with Mr. Welland. 
               Then conducting our young friend to the lady, he said: "Mrs. Goldman, permit me to introduce to you Mr. Louis Welland, a friend of Mr. Tourtelotte." 
               The lady arose and bowed graciously. 
               "I hope you will make our house your home as long as you remain in the neighborhood. Have you known Mr. Tourtelotte long? A charming young man." 
               "I owe my acquaintance with him to a fortunate chance; doubly fortunate, since it has procured me an entree to your house, Madam." 
               The lady bowed. "You will find life dull here. When we came hither from New Orleans, I thought I should have died of ennui." 
               "But death could not prevail on himself to commit so cruel an outrage," replied Welland, with that air of flippant gallantry with which such things are said. 
               "I fear death is not half so good mannered. I suffer dreadfully from my nerves." 
               Welland made a polite grimace. When a lady begins to talk of her nerves, you must either resign yourself good-naturedly to be bored, and then she will consider you a man of mind and heart, or you must resort to a violent alternative and change the topic. In the latter case you will be thought a monster. 
               "The country is very fine," said he, taking the latter alternative. "After a sojourn of years in New York, I enjoy the bracing air of your hills, the mild beauty of your valleys, and the delicious smell of your pine woods exceedingly." 
               "Let me hope that these advantages will compensate for the loss of amusements, which, I confess, would be much more to my taste. I am sorry that my son is absent, for you would find a pleasant companion in him. He is a fine character, Mr. Welland." 
               "Sarah, my love," said Mr. Goldman, "perhaps the gentleman is rather tired from his ride-" 
               "Goldman, my life, don't interrupt me," replied the lady. "I was about to ask, would you like to retire to your apartment, Mr. Welland, and rest till the dinner bell sounds?" 
               "I would be much obliged for the privilege, Madam. Truly, I am not at all presentable," replied Welland, with a smile, glancing at his dusty garments. 
               "Goldman be kind enough to ring for the house-keeper." 
               Mr. Goldman touched a bell. A bright mulatto boy appeared, who was dispatched for the house-keeper. This proved to be an old French crone, with an enormous cap, and bright beady eyes, in whose charge our hero was placed. 
               She conducted him up a wide staircase and into a spacious apartment elegantly furnished in the most modern style. A low French bedstead stood in a recess, with a tasteful drapery of mosquito netting encircling it. The open windows had frames inserted covered with the same netting, and the doors possessed doubles of this transparent material. 
               The mulatto boy appeared presently with Welland's portmanteau, and explained that he had been ordered to consider himself the "strange gemmen's" special attendant. 
               Leaving the young man at his toilet, we will say a few words about the history of the Goldmans. Mrs. Goldman was of French extraction, her mother having been the daughter of one of Napoleon's generals. Her father was a German, and he emigrated to the United States, and settled in New Orleans, when his daughter was quite small. When she grew up, she was married to Mr. Goldman, the factotum of her father, and who managed all his affairs. Beyond his business capacities Mr. Goldman possessed nothing. His wife, however, brought him a large dowry, which soon became a considerable fortune. An epidemic having carried off her parents, the Goldmans became very wealthy. They continued in business and added to their wealth, until their children arrived at years, when impressions are lasting. Then Mrs. Goldman became possessed of the idea of founding a family. 
               Those who know the people of the United States well, will understand all the difficulty of the task which Mrs. Goldman set herself to accomplish. There is no titled aristocracy in this country, but for that very reason there is more pride of family than any where else on God's green earth. It is only genius of the first order or wealth of princely dimensions that is permitted to overleap the barrier drawn around this caste. No official position, not the gubernatorial chair, not the senatorial title buy equality for the possessor. Such men can become the founders of families, but they themselves bear the taint of the parvenu in those sacred social circles. In New England it is the descendants of the Pilgrim fathers and the emigrated English gentry; in New York and Pennsylvania, the families of the Dutch Settlers; in Maryland and Delaware, the stock of the Huguenots exiled by the edict of Nantes, and the Catholics driven from Great Britain by persecutions; in Virginia and the Carolinas, the houses of the first tobacco planters that fought with Captain Smith; in Florida and Louisiana, the offspring of those that came with De Soto, and of the French gentry impoverished by extravagance and driven to seek new homes a century ago. These form the aristocracy of America, and possess more pride and exclusiveness than the bluest blood of Spain. 
               Mrs. Goldman saw that the West was the only region where the social orders had not yet reached a degree of crystallization that made it next to impossible to crowd into the first circles. The West, therefore, was her choice. Cutting adrift from old connections and associations, she urged the purchase of a princely estate in a remote corner of Tennessee, and there, as extensive landed proprietors, she hoped to see her children take their places among the aristocracy of this State, which in part belongs to the West and in part to the South. 
               All the difficulty of the situation will be understood when it is told that the Goldmans were of Hebrew descent, and firmly attached to a rational interpretation of their religion. 
               About their characters: Mrs. Goldman was a strong-minded, practical woman; superficially educated, and not without traits of coarseness and vulgarity; but withal, with a strong appreciation of knowledge, refinement and all the attributes of good society. A lady who could assume good manners and feign refined feelings, and who was ashamed of her business capacities, which were excellent. Moreover there was no lack of affectation in her ways. 
               Mr. Goldman was very good natured, very patient, a sharp, close calculator, as those of his race are apt to be, and a passionate lover of music. He did not know much, but honored knowledge in others. In general he was content to occupy the second place in his house. 
               "Sarah, my love," said he, when they were left alone, "I like the looks of this young man very much." 
               "Goldman, my life," replied she, "don't interrupt me-" 
               "You were not saying any thing." 
               "I was about to say something. He has a very distinguished air. Does Tourtelotte write any thing, in regard to his position or means?" 
               "Nothing, but that he is under obligations tions to him, and hopes we will do all to make his stay here agreeable." 
               "Goldman, my life, don't recite the whole letter. He must be a Frenchman from his tournure." 
               "I should judge him a German. Is Tony going out this evening?" 
               "Goldman, my life, pray don't call her Tony before company. The child's name is Antonia. She is going to ride over to the Palmers." 
               The gentleman turned to leave the room. Mrs. Goldman called after him. 
               "Send the house-keeper in, and tell Mr. Sellington Sharp that my nerves are so bad to-day, I shall be forced to dispense with the pleasure of his company at dinner." 
               Mr. Goldman looked back with a queer smile, but said nothing. 
               In the meanwhile Welland had completed his toilet, and descending, strolled out into the garden, to await the signal for dinner. On every hand he saw the evidences of good taste and ample means. There were rare plants of every variety. Flowers indigenous and foreign grouped with an artistic eye to the effects, and nooks and bowers festooned with the magnificent creepers of the South. After a stroll of a few minutes he returned to the house. Passing through the hall, he was attracted to the front door by the sight of a beautiful gray pony with a side saddle, which was led up and down by a groom. The appointments were so elegant, and the pony so handsome that he waited to see the rider. Nor was he destined to wait long. 
               There was a patter of feet on the stairs and a rustle. He turned and was face to face with a young lady. She wore a light blue habit and a hat with a white plume. One hand held a slender whip, and the other supported her train. 
               There followed a surprised glance from eyes blue and liquid as the sea; the waving of curls golden as the sunlight, and the glancing of a cheek with the faintest rose tinge. Then the young lady made a half bow, tripped down the steps and was on her horse ere Welland had time to stir. Gaily she cantered away. 
               But Welland gazed after her as long as the sky-blue habit could be seen. Then he returned to the garden, and inattentive to the bell, plucked rose after rose, and chewed the rose leaves in a dreamy state of half consciousness. 
               Suddenly a hand touched his arm, and Mr. Goldman stood before him. 
               "Will you come in to dinner?" he asked good naturedly. "Rose leaves are meagre food for young men." 
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
               WELLAND'S cheeks flushed slightly as he dropt the roses, and followed his host into the drawing-room. 
               There Mr. Goldman presented him to an old lady, and, in turn, introduced her as "Madame la Generale Outon." 
               The old lady executed a magnificent courtesy, while Welland gazed in surprise upon her. The wrinkled features, the false front adorned on either side with four short, fat curls, that hung over the forehead; the enormous cap of magnificent blonde; the small neckerchief of Brussels lace, as yellow and more valuable than gold; the flashing solitaire that pinned it; and the quiet dress of heavy gray silk; all made upon him an impression as if some picture of the first empire had stepped from its frame, and saluted him. 
               But there was no time for observations. Mr. Goldman gave the old lady his arm, and Welland offered his to Mrs. Goldman, In this manner they proceeded to the dining-room, and took seats around a table, set out rather showily. 
               During dinner, the lady of the house showed great solicitude regarding Welland, and pressed all dishes on him, in a manner more kind than well-bred. Mr. Goldman, who was an epicure of cultivated palate, gave his judgment on the courses, with the gravity of an oracle, and without a suspicion of the bad taste of this proceeding at his own table. The old lady was quiet and well bred; there was a jauntiness in her movements, and a grandeur in her bows, which bespoke her to belong, not only to the old world, but also to old times. 
               After dinner the party adjourned to the parlor, where coffee was served in small cups. 
               "We are but a quiet family, sir," said Mrs. Goldman, "when the children are absent. Unfortunately, Antonia dines with some neighbors to-day, and so we have no music." 
               "But that is no reason why we should have no patience," said Madame la Generale. "Where is Mr. Sellington Sharp?" 
               "Dear aunt, Mr. Sharp is engaged to-day," replied Mrs. Goldman. 
               "Nonsense, child; send for him at once." 
               Without further resistance, the order was complied with. 
               "Do you play the piano, sir, or sing?" asked the old lady of Welland. 
               "Both, Madam, though perhaps indifferently." 
               "Will you give us the pleasure of listening to you, then? Some old song of the time of the emperor, if you are acquainted with any." 
               "With pleasure," and Welland opened the piano and sang: Partant pour la Syrie." 
               "Thanks, thanks," cried Madame la Generate. "The song of my royal friend Queen Hortense! Sir, will you do me the honor to take a pinch of snuff from this tabatiere? It was presented to my father by the emperor." 
               "Welland complied, and sneezed heartily in consequence. The old lady then, with a great flourish, took a pinch herself, and continued: 
                
               "It was after the Austrian campaign that his majesty presented it to my father." 
               "You refer to the Emperor Napoleon, Madam?" inquired Welland. 
               "Was there any other emperor since Charlemagne?" asked the old lady testily in return. 
               Welland bowed. "Your father was in his service?" 
               "He was a General of division; and my husband was named General de Brigade on the day of--" 
               "I have the honor to make you my compliment," said Welland, expressing his admiration in the French manner. Up started the old lady, and made another sweeping courtesy, which again necessitated a bow in return. 
               Our young friend believed himself transported to one of the Parisian salons of 1815. Madame was just preparing to enlarge on the subjects of her memory, when fortunately Mr. Sellington Sharp arrived, and was introduced. 
               A stout man, with a hook nose, florid complexion and ferret eyes. He was the manager of the estates, and endowed with a good deal of cunning and vulgarity. But he was a good patience player. 
               A table was prepared, and Madame, with the two gentlemen, took their seats at once. 
               Mrs. Goldman and Welland retired to a sofa near one of the windows, and entered into conversation. 
                
               Mrs. Goldman had a purpose. She wished to know more of Welland than Tourtelotte had written them. As she settled the folds of her dress, she considered how to apply the conversational corkscrew. 
               "You express yourself pleased with the scenery of this region," she said. "Have you been here any time, or have you just arrived?" This was inserting the point of the corkscrew. 
               "I have been for two weeks in the adjoining counties, and I have been much charmed," he replied, with a perfect understanding of the process he was being subjected to. 
               "Ah, indeed! There is no enjoyment like traveling for pleasure." 
               "I agree with you, madam." 
               "But few tourists choose our obscure corner of the State for that purpose?" This was turn number one. 
               "Nor did I," replied Welland. 
               "You did not travel for pleasure then? Perhaps on business? Our marbles are much thought of, but the quarries are not sufficiently worked." Turn number two. 
               "It is a pity, for the enterprise would pay. But I do not understand much of marbles." 
               "Perhaps you are interested in agriculture?" 
               "Only so far as devouring its products is concerned." 
                
               Mrs. Goldman thought of inserting her point in a new place. She began: 
               "Political feeling runs high this summer. I fear that there will be trouble." 
               "I hope not. There is too much good sense in the country." 
               "Ah, you have better opportunities of knowing, than we. Confess that you have something to do with Government." This was a turn. 
               "Very willingly. I even hold office." 
               "Well, I must say, that I thought you looked too distinguished for a politician." 
               "For a Tennessee politician perhaps. But I am not a politician," with a bow for the compliment. 
               "In the name of heaven," said Mrs. Goldman, with an assumption of graceful petulance, "what are you?" 
               "A surveyor of State lands, and your obedient servant." 
               "And, pray, pity my ignorance-what is a surveyor?" 
               "One who measures lands by means of certain geometrical instruments, and makes maps that are never looked at." 
               "What does he make them for, then," said the lady, giving a great turn to her screw. 
               "Because he is paid for them," replied Welland, and Mrs. Goldman's cork came out. 
               She had a perfect understanding now of his position. Still there was so much in the man beyond the surveyor, that she was far from being satisfied. So she went to work again. 
               "A person must require a great deal of knowledge to understand your business," she resumed. "Did it take you long to go through the requisite studies?" 
               "It is difficult for me to reply. When I acquired this knowledge, it was in connection with other branches, and before I had any idea of being compelled to derive practical advantages from the results of my studies." 
               "It was at a German university, then?" 
               "It was." 
               "Ah, it is only there people study, without ever intending to put their acquirements to any earthly use!" 
               "Yes, it is only there," repeated he, with some warmth, "that people learn for the mere sake of knowing." 
               "Which is the rankest folly imaginable. Forgive me, but I honor that sort of learning, though aware of its uselessness. It is an incomprehensible motive to my mind." 
               "I should judge so. You are too attractive ever to become a blue-stocking." With which compliment he hoped to escape further questions. 
               "You are very complimentary. I rejoice in the absence of Antonia." 
               "I am sure," said he, becoming all ears at the mention of this name, "in Madame's presence, few others can be in danger of being complimented." 
               "Ah, I suffer too much from my nerves. When I was well, I could lay claim to some looks." 
               "And does Miss Goldman-I beg your pardon," he added hesitatingly, "it was to her, you had reference?" 
               "Exactly." 
               "Does Miss Goldman inherit the looks of her mother?" Oh, the rank hypocrite. 
               "Some say she is very like me. You will have an opportunity of judging tomorrow." 
               "She will return tomorrow, then?" 
               "She will return late to-night. One of our young neighbors will probably escort her home." 
               Welland felt very uncomfortable. Mrs. Goldman noticed that he grew absentminded, and started upon a new theme. 
               "How fortunate that you are a surveyor," she said. 
               "In what respect? Can I be of service to you?" 
               "Perhaps. It is you surveyors that decide on the boundaries of estates? Not so?" 
               "You seem to understand our business perfectly." 
               "Well, there is an old dispute between us and our neighbor." 
               "Regarding a boundary, madam?" 
               "Regarding a hillside, which, some think, is of mineral value." 
               "I shall be happy to investigate the affair. Perhaps Mr. Goldman will enlighten me as to your titles." 
               "Oh, do not speak to him of it. He is the queerest man regarding such matters. Only think, I believe him capable of abandoning our right to that hillside altogether." 
               Welland held up his hands in mock horror. 
               "Is it possible?" he said. 
               "And he has insisted on our leaving the question open, and being on good terms with this neighbor." 
               "How terrible of Mr. Goldman!" 
               "You are laughing at me, sir," said the lady, with some warmth. "But I assure you, I feel deeply on the subject." 
               "No doubt," rejoined Welland, with all the seriousness in the world. "Be assured I shall make it my business to settle the question beyond doubt." 
               "Are you talking philosophy?" inquired Madame la Generale, laying down her cards. "If so, we will stop playing." 
               "You honor us too much," replied Welland. "We were but discussing every day affairs." 
               "I am glad to hear that every day affairs are becoming worthy of being discussed," returned Madame. "It seems to me, that nothing remarkable has happened within the last thirty years." 
               "Certainly nothing that can compete with the events of the thirty years before that," said Welland. 
               The reply seemed to please the old lady. 
               "We live in a meagre and humdrum age now," she said, arranging her superb ruffles; "and the people of these days, and especially of this country, have no conception of the glorious times of the empire. What an army! and what a court! Every prominent man labelled with the name of a battle he had been instrumental in winning; every beautiful woman celebrated for some heroic act she had caused to be performed; and all Europe looking in fear and admiration upon that court, and its great emperor." 
               "It is almost as if you were reciting history," said Welland, reverently. But the others, who had heard these allusions too often, hastened to change the subject. 
               "Who has won," asked Mrs. Goldman. 
               "I have had horrible cards," replied Madame la Generale. "Monsieur Sharp has swept the board." 
               "I knew that I should have good luck with cards to-night," said Sharp, "because I have been so unlucky to-day." 
               "As if that were a reason!" said Madame. "On what terrible misfortunes do you wish us to sympathize with you?" 
               "Why," replied Sharp, "first of all, when I was alone in the office this morning, all alone by myself, with nobody but our Lord watching over me, there entered one of the sub-managers-the new man, Mr. Herring. We went over some business, and, without my perceiving it, he placed a pistol, a loaded pistol, a revolver, upon my desk." 
                
               "Well, what of that," asked Mr. Goldman. 
               "What of that?" repeated Sharp, with the greatest indignation. "Did you never hear of a pistol going off? Have you never read of people being shot without the least notice, by accidents happening with pistols? Mr. Goldman, you talk like a child." 
               "Well, what became of the pistol," asked Mr. Goldman further. 
               "What became of it? Confound his recklessness, he left it there." 
               "Left it on your desk?" 
               "On my desk, lying on top of the bills I was going to look over this morning; and I all alone in the office." 
               "Why didn't you call one of the servants, and have it removed?" 
               "Am I a fool, sir? None of the niggers understand pistols. Was I going to let them handle such a thing, and cause a misfortune to happen? Not while Sellington Sharp was in the room." 
               "Well, why didn't you leave the room then, while it was removed!" 
               "Am I crazy? With the desk open, and money in it? I know niggers better than that. Besides," he added sentimentally, "they are men too, and worth several hundred dollars each. I didn't want them shot." 
               "But you might have locked the desk," urged Mrs. Goldman. 
               "Yes, indeed; I might have sat down right before the pistol, face to face, and stuck my keys in the lock, and turned it, and shaken the confounded thing, and, do you know with what result? Sellington Sharp would have been a dead man." 
               "Well, in heaven's name, what did you do?" asked the lady. 
               "I sat down in a corner of the room, and watched it. And when I left, I slammed the door, hoping it would go off. But it didn't. Then I turned the key, and there it is, all alone now, and I hope the Lord will watch over us here in the house. Tomorrow Mr. Herring returns." 
               "Any more misfortunes of this sort?" 
               "Only that I tried to kill a turkey, and the knife slipped, making it unclean." 
               "He kills the poultry we use, in accordance with an old custom of the family," said Mr. Goldman, in reply to Welland's look of mirthful inquiry. 
               "Excuse me," said Welland, blushing, "I understand the custom." 
               "We are a Hebrew family, sir," said the old lady, with dignity, and unobservant of the embarrassment of her niece and her husband, "and it is a religious custom." 
               "I know it, madam," he replied, smiling, "and I have the honor of professing the same faith." 
               There was a pause of astonishment, which Sharp, who, beside possessing an excellent head for business, and being a gourmand of the first water, above all, prided himself on his proficiency as maitre de cuisine, (having been cook to his company pany in the French army,) and delighted in opportunities of doing a little amateur cooking, broke, saying: 
               "But, we shall have a turkey to-morrow, notwithstanding, and I will prepare it myself; ladies, I wish you good-night, and hope the presence of the pistol in the house will not disturb you." 
               The party broke up, and soon all was quiet. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               NEXT morning Miss Antonia had not returned, but sent a message that she would be home for dinner. The breakfast was a quiet one, since Madame la Generale always partook of that meal in her own room, and Mr. Sharp breakfasted long before the rest. Mr. Goldman said that business would call him to Sycamore, and he should be glad to have Mr. Welland's company. After a number of charges by Mrs. Goldman, and innumerable orders for the different stores in town, the two gentlemen started. 
               The morning was very fair. From a sky, as soft and mysterious as an infant's eye, flashed the early sun in the fullness of life, and the exhilaration of beauty. The great golden cones of flame, that fell flashing on wood and river, seemed teeming with the joys of an exuberant vitality, and the snowy vapors, that rose from secluded dells, resembled the breath of an animal, just awakened to the gladness of existence. 
               In the afternoon, Mrs. Goldman and her aunt took their usual drive to some part of the estate. They had left but a few minutes, when a gentleman dashed up, and dismounting, entered the house, followed by an enormous hound. He was informed that none of the family were in. Accordingly, he left messages that he would call after dinner, and requested that his hound might be accommodated in the meanwhile, since he found him troublesome to take where he was going to call. One of the negroes showed him a small sort of kitchen, adjoining, but separated from the main kitchen, and which was rarely used, except when the ladies or Mr. Sharp indulged in amateur and experimental cookery. The gentleman opened the door, and called to the hound, who bounded in. Then closing the door, he turned the key. 
               Now Mr. Sharp was in the small kitchen at that very time. He had entered about an hour before with a negro, who proceeded to build a fire. Then he sent him for an armfull of wood, and had an enormous Dutch oven deposited on the hearth. A few other necessaries were gotten together by the sable attendant, and then Mr. Sharp said: 
               "Now Charley, leave me alone. I must devote my mind to this affair." 
               The servant departed. Mr. Sharp took off his respectable black coat; then he turned up his stiffly-starched wristbands; finally he put on an apron. The transformation was complete. 
               He peeled some small white onions, and cut them into the most diminutive slices. Then some bread was soaked, and some hashed chicken mixed with it; and then the liver, heart and gizzard of the turkey added. And now Mr. Sharp stood over his saucepan, like a magician mixing the elixir of life. A little salt, some pepper, more salt, some other spice; bits of fat, and heaven only knows what else, went in to make that triumph of art, the stuffing. At last it was satisfactory. Sharp, who took a final taste, carried the saucepan to the fire with a smile of exultation. 
               "They will see that we understand how to bake turkeys, in the 48th of the line. Ma foi, we were gourmands there!" 
               The mess was now put over a small extension of the fire, at the right of the Dutch oven, and stirred frequently. Mysterious ingredients, herbs, fluids, and spices, were occasionally added. At last it seemed finished. Sharp took the pan from the coals, and put it a little aside. 
               Then he heaped wood on the hearth, and got the turkey. It was large and beautiful, with a bright golden tinge over its fatty parts. Dissolving salt in water, and adding pepper, he rubbed the bird all over with this mixture, inside and out, and then took a kernel of garlic and performed the same office. Finally, he put it to the fire to warm, before introducing the stuffing. 
                
               Mr. Sharp was an economist in time. He would not lose any, while the fowl was warming. So he retired to a dresser, to take the first steps for preparing the sauce. The sauce, that most important of the parts of a dish! The sauce, that manifestation of the character of a cook; that only medium, in which the maitre de cuisine can, untrammeled by circumstances, give expression to his inmost character; the sauce, the glory or shame of its maker, the damnation or apotheosis of a cook. 
               "I will show them how they made sauces in the 48th. American cookery-nonsense! New Orleans cookery-bosh!" And Mr. Sharp, in the intensity of his attention, and the concentration of his faculties upon the important matter in hand, became dead to all external impression. He had neither eyes nor ears for any thing but his sauce. The divine inspiration filled his soul. 
               When the stock of the sauce had been prepared, he turned to go to the fire, carrying the dish in his hand. 
               A growl. 
               Mr. Sharp lifted his eyes. In front of the hearth lay a monster. This monster was a dog. 
               Any one who has seen the pure bred bloodhound, is not likely to forget the strong wickedness or wicked strength of its expression. The iron ferocity of the jaw. The jealous and suspicious glance of the blood-shot eye. The ragged hang of the ears. The tremendous power of the neck. The bloodhound is, in fact, the Satan of the canine race. 
               The dog before the hearth was a blood-hound. It kept its eye upon Sharp. The poor man knew not what to do. 
               His first impulse was to retreat. Another growl. His next to conciliate. A series of growls. 
               With superhuman courage he advanced a step. Immediately the dog was on his legs, and showed a double row of teeth, as brilliantly white as those of a fair woman. Sharp shook with fear. He tried to cry out. His voice refused. He tried to set down the dish with his precious sauce. The beast would not allow it. Every motion was attended by a growl. And though the dog lay down when he was quiet, yet he always kept one of those dreadful eyes fixed upon poor Sharp. 
               Suddenly his gaze was attracted by a great brightness on the hearth. He looked up, and beheld the wood burned finely. The turkey, which lay there to warm, shone like gold. The stuffing made a hissing noise in the saucepan. 
               "My God! is there nothing to appease this dreadful brute?" he cried in despair. "Doggie, good doggie, now-ow-ow!" and he produced that soothing growl, which is supposed to express conciliation in the language of animals, and which men enunciate with a doubtful sound, when compelled to pass behind a kicking mare or mule. 
               The dog was deaf to the Syren's voice. He heeded not the outstretched hand. He sturdily opposed any advance or retreat, whatever. And there stood Sharp with the dish in his hand. 
               The fire burned on. The turkey grew brown and hard. The stuffing had ceased to sizzle, and became a solid cake. The rays of the sun shot horizontally. 
               Sharp cried for help. The dog opened both eyes. He shouted again. The dog sat up. In his extremity he ventured a third call. The dog gave a low growl, and made for him. 
               Sharp turned and ran blindly, until hitting the wall he fell to the floor. Not being devoured, he looked up. The dog had resumed his place. 
               The fire was very large. The turkey's legs began to catch, and burned beautifully. The stuffing was baked to the pan. Sharp lifted up his voice and wept aloud. The dog kept his eye on him. 
               The passion of his grief having exhausted itself, he wiped his eyes, and considered the situation. It was near dinner-time. The turkey was burnt. The stuffing ruined. The sauce nipped in the bud. He was on the floor in a remote corner, with an ever watchful eye to observe him. Without extraneous aid, an extrication was impossible. The dog was master of the situation. 
               Two hours must elapse before the family would feel alarmed. He turned pale. It would perhaps, be supposed, that he had gone to town. He turned yellow. He might be left all night with the beast, and the dog might become mad. He turned blue. 
               The fire went out. A black charry mass represented the turkey. The stuffing was not to be distinguished from the pan. Night fell, and it grew quite dark in the room. 
               Sharp grew furious. He violently demanded to know, why he ever left New Orleans, to vegetate in this savage corner of Tennessee, where bloodhounds were trained to devour peaceable citizens? The dog making no reply, and the walls remaining dumb, he again manifested an earnest desire to be informed why he ever undertook such a foolish affair? And there being still no answer, he finally insisted upon being informed, why he ever was born, and whether he was going to pass the rest of his life in this kitchen with a bloodthirsty hound as companion? 
               The dog, however, bore his position with great philosophy, and uttered no complaint. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VII. 
               ABOUT an hour before dinner, Mr. Goldman and his guest returned from town. The latter, who saw the grey pony being groomed, hastened up-stairs to arrange his toilet, while Mr. Goldman excused himself, and began to turn out his pockets, and take account of the thousand and one things he had been commissioned to get. When Welland had dressed, he picked up a book and descended. Glancing into the parlor, he found it untenanted, and therefore strolled out. He was alone in the garden. 
               He tried to read. But his thoughts would wander from the page, and indulge in visions, the principal figure of which, always wore a blue habit and white plume, and sat on a gray pony. He made repeated attempts to chain his ideas to the book before him. But his imagination would not rest, and splendid air castles reared their proud turrets in the evening light, and soft music came from their halls, and figures entered the high portals, and the chiefest of them was ever attired in a blue habit, and was forever holding the hand of the dreamer. Suddenly his visions seemed to take bodily shape, as a sweet, deep voice, spoke at his side: 
               "I bid you welcome to my garden, Mr. Welland." 
               It was the young lady of the day before. But not in a blue habit. Soft folds of white encompassed her form, and her fine throat and wrists were encircled by bands of maroon velvet. A strip of the same, ran round the bottom of her dress, in serpentine windings. In her hair, and on her bosom, were freshly-gathered roses. 
               With an effort, he recovered himself from a prolonged stare, and with the ease of a man of the world, replied: 
                
               "Thank you, Miss Goldman. Its beauty has made me a dreamer." 
               "I fear then, that it is my mission to chase away the fair creations of your fancy. I am going to ask you to do a very commonplace, matter-of-fact thing." 
               "It can never be commonplace to me, when you ask it." 
               "Gallantly said, sir. But it is commonplace, notwithstanding. Will you carry the basket while I cut a few flowers?" 
               Assenting with a bow, he took it up, and followed the lady, who went from bush to bush, and culled the choicest roses. 
               And again his spirit revelled in dreams, and his eyes assumed the looks of one gazing into the future, or the past. And through the haze of long years, he seemed to see himself, a bright boy, following his beautiful young mother around the old garden. And then, as now, he carried the basket, while she cut roses. Only- 
               "Why, Mr. Welland, if you come not to my aid, I shall be weighed down to earth by all these flowers!" Thus again that remarkably deep sweet voice startled him. 
               And it was a glorious sight, to which his gaze was recalled. At a little distance stood Miss Goldman, with her arms full of roses, that tumbled over and hung on her dress, or fell to the ground. There were all sorts of roses. Deep damask ones, with their passionate glow. Bright moss roses with their plush-like stems and cups, and their burning cores. Pink beauties just tinted with the glory of color. White emblems of innocence that hung, pure as snow-flakes, between their green leaves. And yellow tea-roses, gorgeous and large. 
               Welland came to the rescue with his basket. "Forgive me," he said, "for my fits of abstraction. You know that we Germans are dreamers, and the perfume of your flowers seems to soothe me, as the Lotos does the poets of the East." 
               "You are indeed happy," she replied, half seriously, and half in jest, "if your imagination can supply you with fairer visions, than have been spread out before our eyes in this world of ours." 
               "Your reproof is full of justice," replied Welland, earnestly. "Had your lips not pronounced it, in your presence I should have felt it nevertheless." 
               Miss Goldman blushed. 
               "Our Tennessee ears are not used to Parisian phrases, sir. Have you had a fine ride with father?" 
               "A glorious one. And, you do not know, how interesting it is for me to listen to the views of one brought up in the practical school of experience, as he has been." 
               "As a general thing, schoolmen look with disdain on such views, and believe, that in the abstraction of their studies, they can frame a juster theory of the living world, than the man that fights his way through its battles. They may have more comprehension in regard to this subject. But the man of experience, with his narrow views has the advantage of correctness of estimate." 
               "I have sometimes entertained this same opinion," returned Welland "at variance, as it is, with University maxims." 
               "Oh, your German Universities!" said the young lady, with a smile like a May morning. "Are they not pyramids that preserve the dead dogmas, the defunct principles, and the buried prejudices of a dead past? What charnel houses are like those universities? And to the spirits of these dead things, your professors continue to sacrifice the children of the living age. It is as bad as casting babes to Moloch." 
               "You are severe," said Welland; he listened with awe-struck admiration to the sounds of that magnificent alto voice, vibrating with the earnestness of deep feeling, and scarce heard the words. "You enumerate their defects without paying tribute to their merits." 
               "Oh, as for their merits, they seem to turn out very good young men, who are liable to fits of abstraction, and who make neglectful attendants, when they carry a basket for a lady." 
               "I beg your pardon. I forgot all about the basket." And he gathered the flowers she had cut, and placed them with the others. 
               "Having thus successfully begged the question you asked," said the young lady, "I will do penance, and acknowledge that, though educated in France, I adore German music, German poetry, German philosophy; in short, every thing German, except-" 
               "Except what?" asked Welland, with a smile. 
               "I was going to commit a rudeness-" 
               "It is impossible for you to do so. Except?" 
               "Except the Germans!" 
               "Unfortunate nation!" cried Welland, with mock sorrow. 
               She looked into his eyes, and he returned the glance. At first her glance was taunting, challenging, with a gleam of polite mirth. His, throughout, was respectful, admiring, but firm and manly, bright with an earnest consciousness of innate worth. And that calm firm eye, dark and beautiful as night, slowly mastered every resistance in her glance, and seemed to dive down with resistless power into the liquid depth before him. It seemed as if he gazed down into her soul, and meanwhile held her body chained in electric bonds. At last, without removing his eyes, he seemed to withdraw their force, and she slowly dropped her's to the ground, and drew a long breath. 
               A step approached. Both looked up, and Tourtelotte stood before them. His face was calm, but his eyes shone with the wild cat fierceness, which is occasionally observed in the eye of the Creole. Both felt that he was excited, and both were conscious of a guilty feeling in themselves. 
               "A fair evening, Miss Goldman," said Tourtelotte, and added, with some bitterness, "I owe you thanks for the great kindness shown to my friend Welland," and he bowed to the latter. 
               "I am very glad to see you again," said Miss Goldman, presenting a hand as white and transparent as wax, "and all the more happy, since I am in need of your services." 
               "Ah!" cried Tourtelotte, and his eyes softened, "you are determined to keep me under obligations. What can I do?" 
               "Take this basket of roses from Mr. Welland, who is altogether too grave and serious a personage, to bear so fanciful a burden. Will you?" 
               "If Mr. Welland were a fiery dragon, I would take it all the same, at your command," and he did so. 
               "Unfortunately, I am not," said Welland, smiling at this extravaganza. "I believe the race is extinct." 
               "But the race of valiant knights still lives," rejoined the lady, throwing a mirthful glance at Tourtelotte. 
               "And the race of fair ladies was never better represented," replied the young planter. 
               Miss Goldman made a sweeping courtesy and laughed. Then taking Welland's arm, she said: 
               "The dinner bell has sounded. Let us go in." Tourtelotte followed with the basket. 
                
               "Speaking of monsters," suddenly said the young lady, "where is Ugly?" 
               "Why," replied Tourtelotte, "Ug misbehaved this morning, and I brought him here, and looked him in an empty room. The man I purchased him of, warned me, that he had fits of ill humor. I wrote to Mr. Goldman about it." 
               "I know," replied Miss Goldman. "But when will you show him to us?" 
               "After dinner," said Tourtelotte, "if you wish it." 
               They entered the house, and the lady delivered the flowers to a servant, to be sprinkled with water, and brought to the parlor after dinner. 
               Mr. and Mrs. Goldman, and Madame Outon were waiting. They all welcomed Tourtelotte with great cordiality. Welland, conscious at once of the sense of the company, by that delicate perception which people of cultivated and poetic minds possess, left Miss Goldman's side, and attached himself to the old lady. Thus Miss Goldman was virtually placed in charge of the young Creole, for the evening. 
               The dinner passed off quietly. Madame la Generale had gotten herself up this evening, and she looked as if she was prepared to go to court. There was a turban of magnificent dimensions on her head, and two long plumes swept down her back. A barbe of lace, ending in a long silver fringe, hung over her left shoulder, and she wore a neckerchief of inestimable value. The dress was of deep red satin. There was just a touch of power on her front, and from her wrist depended a fan painted with all the gods of Olympus. The secret of this overpowering get-up was, that Madame intended to pay a visit after dinner. Being accordingly in her mood of state, she infused a double dose of politeness into her speeches, and was, in fact, ceremony on a pedestal. 
               "Has Madame never thought of re-visiting France, and paying her respects to the present representative of the Bonaparte dynasty?" asked Welland, for the sake of saying something. 
               "Never, my dear Mr. Welland," replied the old lady. "My recollections of the past are too great for me to desire to have them diminished, by a knowledge of the present. Why, I have held le Prince Louis in my lap when he was a child. But what is he, to take the place of the Emperor?" 
               Welland, whose eyes and ears had been attracted by the conversation of Antonia and Tourtelotte, scarce heard the old lady, and when she ceased, merely said: 
               "What indeed?" 
               "You can have no idea of the power of his presence," continued Madame, who was sailing into her old recollections, with every stitch of canvass spread. "There was something magnetic in him, which apprised you at once of his vicinity. When you were in a saloon, in the full tide of conversation, there was a sudden hesitation tion, a hush, a thrill, which every one felt, when His Majesty entered, though none saw him." 
               Welland was still intent on his observations. Feeling it necessary to say something, he said: "Indeed?" 
               "Oh," continued Madame, "he was more than a man, he was greater than a hero, he was mightier than a prophet-he was a genius!" 
               And in this strain, all through dinner. After dinner, there were loud demands for Ug. 
               "Will you not assist me to liberate him?" asked Tourtelotte. 
               "No, bring him into the parlor." 
               Presently Tourtelotte entered the parlor, laughing with might and main. 
               "What is it?" was the general demand. 
               "Excuse me-oh! I shall die of laughing!" 
               "What in the world is it?" cried all. 
               "Come with me. It is indescribable. Please do not ask, but come with me." 
               All followed him to the little kitchen, a negro with lights preceding them. 
               By the wall lay Mr. Sharp clamoring to be liberated. Before the hearth sat the dog, watchful and wagging his tail in acknowledgment of the presence of his master. The burnt turkey, the extinguished fire, the lamenting amateur cook, and the dog, all told the story of the affair. 
               "Call off the dog, Mr. Tourtelotte," cried Welland, sternly, suspecting that all had been arranged intentionally. 
               "And if I should not choose to do so?" asked Tourtelotte. 
               "Then the dog must suffer," replied Welland, stepping forward. 
               "For God's sake, gentlemen, drive that brute off," cried Sharp. "I am half dead." 
               "And you have almost killed me with laughter," said Tourtelotte; "I thank you for this detectable comedy, Mr. Sharp. Wouldn't you like to stay here all night?" 
               "Please call the dog, Mr. Tourtelotte," said Antonia. 
               "Come here Ugly!" and the hound followed his master to the parlor. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               IT was quite early next morning, when Frank Tourtelotte burst into Welland's room, crying: "Louis Welland, I believe I was rude to you last night. I am come to offer explanations." "I wish you a very good morning," returned the other, shaking the proffered hand heartily. "As for your explanations, they are superfluous, for I don't remember any thing that calls for them." And he got out of bed. 
               "Do you know what brought me over so early?" asked Tourtelotte. "I want to take you back with me to breakfast." 
               "And for the sake of paying me this compliment, you have brushed the early dew from the flowers? I should be very grateful." 
               "You don't seem to be; have I disturbed happy dreams?" 
               "Not at all. However, when you call so early, and invade one's bed-room, you must expect to witness one's toilet. Will you take a book?" 
               The Creole picked up a volume, while Welland got out of bed, and dressed. He was soon ready. 
               "Now for my horse," he said. 
               "I have taken the liberty of bringing one of mine, which I request you to make use of for the present," said Tourtelotte. 
               "Thank you. I have my own." 
               "But I hope you will try mine. Don't be refractory, for I am bound to have my way this morning." 
               "Very well. I deliver myself into your hands." 
               The young men descended, and Welland found two beautiful thorough breds waiting for them. They mounted, and cantered away. 
               The sun shone brightly, and the birds sang loudly in the merry green trees. The dewdrops glistened on grasses and leaves, and the wild flowers waved from bushes and banks. The summer insects began to hum, and the woods were awake with the rustling of boughs. 
               Sad, indeed, must be the heart of that man, who can withstand the influences of such a morning, when he is full of health, and mounted on a good horse. At such a time, one is tempted to believe that grief is a chimera. 
               Both young men felt their spirits rise, as if with the intoxication of champagne. Both were full to the brim of amiable feelings, and altogether they had never had a better opinion of each other, or of the world in general, than at the present moment. 
               "What will the ladies say, when they find that I have carried off their guest, in the most unceremonious manner?" cried Tourtelotte, laying his hand on the neck of the other's horse, as they both walked their animals. 
               "I have requested the housekeeper to make my excuses," replied Welland. "Do you know that I am very grateful for your introduction to this family? I admire your friends vastly." 
               "All of them?" asked the other, with a mirthful glance. 
               "Yes, they are very nice people; each has his salient points." 
               "Oh, no doubt; you are quite in love with Madame la Generale, I suppose. Isn't that what you mean?" 
               "Not exactly, though Madame is a venerable lady, animated by the recollections of a grand time." 
               "Yes; Napoleon, and all that. I have heard it so often, that I began to love the Bourbons. So Madame has not captivated you, notwithstanding red satin, feathers and diamonds. Perhaps Mrs. Goldman pleases you?" 
               "Both Mr. and Mrs. Goldman are very estimable people, full of sense and kindness. I respect them highly." 
               "Oh, yes, keep in the propriety of language! 'Sarah, my love,' and 'Goldman my life,' do very well. But, deuce take it, my dear fellow, I don't mean them, and you know very well, that I don't." 
               "Whom do you mean then? Perhaps Mr. Sharp? I am quite charmed with him." 
               Tourtelotte burst into a merry laugh. "Wasn't that excellent? Ug deserves a crown of glory for his doings. What a fine hound he is! He wouldn't let Sharp move a finger, nor even cry out. Our hounds here, will not do that to any one, but a nigger. But Ug is of Australian breed, where they hunt the white convicts with bloodhounds." 
               "It was a terrible situation for Sharp," said Welland, smiling, "and I could not but pity the poor fellow." 
               "It was worth the best comedy I ever saw enacted," returned Tourtelotte. "But that is not the point I wished to converse on. What I wished to hear, was your opinion of Antonia?" 
               "Of Antonia?" raising his brows in protest. 
               "Of Miss Goldman, then." 
               "Miss Goldman? She is a young lady of very attractive looks, and seems to possess not only accomplishments, but also an ease of manner, and sprightliness of conversation, quite remarkable." This was said with restraint in the voice, and a forced expression of indifference. 
               "What a temperate mind you possess! Why, Louis Welland, she is a pearl of beauty, and as full of amusing ideas and charming thoughts, as any human being ever was. In short," he cried with liquid eyes, "she is the loveliest woman in the world!" 
               "Mr. Tourtelotte-" 
               "Don't call me Mr. Tourtelotte-I have proposed that we should be friends, let me urge the tutoyer. Call me Frank, and let me call you Louis." 
               Welland hesitated a moment, but was deeply touched by the open-hearted confidence of the other. He looked at Tourtelotte's beseeching eyes, and said: 
               "Be it so. Frank, we are friends." 
               They shook hands upon it. 
               "There is my house," said Frank, pointing to a large white building, which was almost entombed in the enormous old mulberry trees, that encompassed it. They were riding through an extensive plantation, cultivated in a high degree. Fields of almost fabulous extent, planted with wheat and corn, skirted either side of the road. In the distance, meadows upon which cattle were grazing, bordered on a broad brook. 
               They put spurs to their horses and in a few minutes dismounted at the door of the house. A negro took the horses, and Tourtelotte at once led Welland into the parlor, and introduced him to his cousin, a lady considerably older than himself. She led the way to the breakfast room, and did the honors; both gentlemen gave evidence of a sharpened appetite, by the way in which they disposed of the viands. 
               The breakfast being concluded, Miss Tourtelotte excused herself, and left the friends alone. Frank immediately sent for a bottle of wine. The servant received the keys from his master, and brought a bottle, dingy, old, and covered with dust. 
               "This is the best wine I have in the house," said Tourtelotte, applying the corkscrew. "It is Liebfrauenmilch of 1811, and was purchased by my father." 
               He drew the cork, and a rich vinous aroma filled the room. The servant had placed two Venetian glasses before them, and when the wine was poured out, it proved as thick as oil, and as yellow as gold. It shone with transcendent beauty in the light-spun goblets, and seemed to emit golden gleams and hues. 
               "To our friendship," said Welland, lifting his glass. 
               "That shall be the second toast. Forgive me, but the first must be: 'to Antonia!'" 
               They clinked glasses and drank it, but with different feelings. 
               The wine was exquisite. All the poetry of the Rhine Valley, and all the sunniness of that garden of Germany seemed embodied ied in each drop. It would have been mockery to praise it. But Tourtelotte said: 
               "It is worthy of the toast." 
               And now he began to grow more confidential. 
               "She returned from France a year ago," he said, "and I have loved her ever since. She occupies all my thoughts, she is the aim of all my hopes. If I imagine Heaven, it is with but a single angel, and that is Antonia." 
               "Your feelings are strong, no doubt," said Welland, kindly. "But is it well to give way to them to such an extent?" 
               "How can I restrain myself when she is the subject? But-you are right. I will speak calmly, and give you a practical view of our relations. Miss Goldman-isn't Antonia a pretty name?" 
               "Very." 
               "Miss Goldman is kind and friendly to me, and I am treated with more confidence by her, than any other gentleman of her acquaintance. But, whenever I assume a warmer tone, she so adroitly escapes falling in with it, that I have often thought that this might be the consequence of some prohibition, or, perhaps, some resolve of her own." 
               "Who would prohibit? Are the parents adverse?" 
               "On the contrary. I have sounded them both, as much as I could, without distinct encouragement from Antonia. Both seem favorably inclined." 
                
               "I can not see where the obstacle is, then." 
               "Nor can I. But I feel that there is an obstacle. At times I get so discouraged, that I am like a madman, and ride to town, and riot and gamble, and generally return a great deal poorer than I went." 
               "That is not my remedy for disappointment." 
               "I know. Nor ought it to be mine, on more accounts than one." 
               "It ruins your health." 
               "And my fortune. There are enough mortgages on the old plantation from my father's time, to incline me to save, instead of dissipating, what is left." 
               "The estate must yield a great income." 
               "It does, but it wants improvements. It could yield almost double, what it does now. The Goldmans are rich, rich in ready money-" 
               "What are you saying?" 
               "And were I to marry Antonia, I might pay off all mortgages, and make the place the finest, and most productive in Tennessee." 
               "You do not mean that! If you love the lady, for God's sake don't mix any mercantile calculations with your passion." 
               "What dreamers you Germans are! Always trying to balance upon the rope of pure perfection, high above all the rest of humanity! Of course I do not think of her father's money, when I wish to marry Antonia. But loving her, and wishing to marry her, I am very glad that the father is rich, so as to aid me in re-establishing the glory of our old family." 
               Welland drank his wine in silence. 
               A servant entered, and brought a note to Tourtelotte. 
               "My dear Louis, you will excuse me?" and broke the seal. A shadow passed over his countenance as he read. When he had finished, he crumbled the paper in his hand, and gulped down the rest of the wine. 
               "I am notified of the arrival of two gentlemen on business," he said, turning to Welland, "and must take advantage of your kindness, to beg you to excuse me for half an hour." 
               "Pray, do not put yourself out, in the least," replied Welland. "I shall at once ride back to Pineland." This was the name, which the Goldmans had given to their estate. 
               Tourtelotte looked relieved. "I shall probably join you in the evening," he said, pressing the other's hand. 
               The servant was called, while Welland took leave of Miss Tourtelotte in the garden. Then he mounted. About to start off, he happened to look up. There were two faces at the parlor window. One was that of Hassel the gambler, the other belonged to Reichenau the merchant. 
               Welland galloped back with a puzzled face. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER IX. 
               IN Welland's head thoughts were busy. To find Hassel in Tourtelotte's mansion was very strange; stranger yet, that his friend, who, doubtless, was apprised of the presence of the gambler, should not allude to him in the least. Still, as Hassel was the agent of a political party, his visit might find its explanation in this. But Reichenau the merchant, had probably come, as usual among Northern men of capital, to arrange for the purchase of next fall's harvest from Tourtelotte. 
               So the young German dismissed the matter from his mind. And now came one of those internal battles, that are put off by the weak in character, and fought out by the strong; one of those combats between the natural inclinations of the heart, and the teachings and experiences of education, that occur in every life again and again, and which often leave the soul wounded and desolate, crying for bread and receiving a stone. 
               It was clear, that after the confidences of that morning, honor demanded of Welland to abstain from making the least effort to win Antonia Goldman's affections. Worldly wisdom had demanded it from the first, in consequence of the great disparity of fortune and social position between the parties. But worldly wisdom is little heeded by Germans of education, while honor is their dictator par excellence. So our friend resolutely set about tearing down those splendid air castles of the previous after-noon, and tried to banish the form, that would flit before his vision. He finally succeeded in convincing himself, by very logical arguments, that there were no such things as blue riding habits, and that white plumes only existed in excited imaginations. 
               He had almost reached Pineland, when a horse cantered up to him, and the deep, rich voice that made his heart thrill with pleasure, said: 
               "It seems that you even dream on horseback, Mr. Welland. You must be the knight Heine sings of, who is asleep all day, and only wakes up at midnight, when the fairies and water nymphs visit his room." 
               She sat on the gray pony, with the blue habit sweeping almost to the ground, and the white plume waving in the breeze. In sunny confusion hung her golden hair, and the sea-blue eyes twinkled with merriment. 
               "You are right, Miss Goldman," he said, sadly. "All my real existence lies in the dreamy regions of memory, and my present life is but a heavy sleep." 
               "Don't frighten me with these sentences a la Jean Paul. I am at once the most frivolous, and the most practical girl in the world, and I deny the existence of dreams altogether." 
               "Have you never dreamt?" 
                
               "Never in my life. And I hope I never will, for I should be afraid to go to bed, ever after." 
               "You are one of those fortunate mortals, that enjoy all the glories of the world in reality, and therefore have no need of dreams, to gild a poor existence." 
               "I believe I am, and simply because I have a heart full of joy," said the young girl. "Every external object takes its color from one's own feelings." 
               "But those feelings are not under the control of the will. It is as vain to order a serious man to laugh, as it is to bid a merry one weep." 
               "I shall not be led upon the dangerous ground of argument, by a University man. You are our guest, and I mean to chase away your dark spirits, whether it be according to the rules of logic, or not." 
               "You have but to command," replied Welland, breaking into a smile, in return for the rosebud gleam of those lips, which almost made him forget his resolutions, "you have but to command, and all dark spirits vanish." 
               "I do command then. Do you know," she said, with charming confidence, "that when I heard what a learned person you were, I feared that you would not talk with me on my favorite authors, but always descant on mathematics, astronomy, and all the rest of the hard sciences?" 
               "So you denied me all poetic appreciation a priori? And then found that I was a dreamer and an imaginative person? What a disappointment!" 
               "On the contrary, I rejoice over it. I have long desired to know somebody, with whom I could talk of the literature of the present age. My aunt takes interest in these matters, but her latest literary recollection is of Goethe." 
               "And you consider Goethe superannuated?" 
               "You are sure to laugh at me, but Goethe has ceased to live with the French revolution." 
               "My dear Miss Goldman, Goethe is immortal." 
               "As a historical object. But as a living presence, influencing the men of this world, his activity ceased with the French revolution." 
               "Why so?" 
               "Because he entered into combat with it, and the God manifested in the uprising of that nation, was more powerful; than the Apollo that inspired Goethe." 
               "And who, then, is his successor?" 
               "You will again laugh at me." 
               "I am not inclined to do so." 
               "The only successor Goethe has on the fields of literature and humanity, is George Sand." 
               "George Sand? that spasmodic, sentimental, spirit-conjuring French woman? My dear Miss Goldman, permit me to suspect, that either you do not appreciate what is highest in Goethe, or that you can not recognize what is lowest in George Sand." 
               "I have earnestly tried to understand both, and in their respective ages, I find their tendencies identical. As for Goethe's immortality, or any one else's, it consists in having influenced his age beneficially, and having led it nearer to the high aims of humanity. Therefore, in connection with the history of that age, he will always be remembered." 
               "You seem to imply, that no man influences any age, but his own?" observed Welland, smiling, and keeping upon the surface of the subject, as the manners of good society require one to do. Pedants and bores only turn the saloon into a lecture room. 
               "I do not think any man does, and therefore I will call no one immortal. The only influence that pervades and moves all ages, and the only one deserving the attribute of immortality, is that of God." 
               There was no reply possible to this remark, and keep on the footing of light conversation. So Welland merely bowed. 
               He liked just now to get into this sort of conversation with Antonia. It helped him to guard his heart. Talk of this kind, like loose fragments and rubbish, would serve as a foundation to rear that wall of indifference upon, which honor bade him build between them. And beside, it is exceedingly amusing, to hear a woman handle heavy subjects in a right feminine manner. They have such graceful ways of disposing of difficulties, and jumping at results, that logic bows humbly before them. 
               They arrived at Pineland, continuing to talk in this light strain, and Welland helped the lady to dismount. He had begun to think, that it was not so difficult after all, to turn an embryo passion into friendship and mere regard. But when he assisted Antonia from her pony, and felt her light weight on his shoulder, when a flying curl brushed his cheek, and the blue habit swept around him, there was a rush of blood to his head, and it was with difficulty he preserved appearances. 
               After lunch, Mr. Sellington Sharp invited the young man to visit his office, which lay in a distant corner of the house; from thence they took a walk to some of the negro huts. 
               "Really," said Welland, looking at the nice little frame huts, "these laborers seem to be pretty well off, but why do you do nothing to reform their morals? I have heard queer stories of the domestic relations consequent upon their state of bondage." 
               "My dear sir," replied Sharp, "what do you call reform? Now I call reform, when you show me a silver water pitcher; we have no use for that, but we want a tea-pot; so I take it, and I melt it down, and fashion a tea-pot out of it. That's reforming. But if I had no pitcher to make the tea-pot out of, I couldn't reform. The niggers have no morals. How are you going to reform their morals then?" 
               Welland laughed heartily at this illustration of the subject. He saw that it wouldn't do, to argue with Mr. Sharp; and Mr. Sharp took great glory in having silenced the other. 
               "What did Mrs. Goldman tell me you were?" asked the manager. 
               "A surveyor. A man that measures and lays out the public lands." 
               "A surveyor," repeated Mr. Sharp, slowly. "A surveyor? That can not be a very paying position?" 
               Welland blushed. "So it is sufficient for my necessities, the matter does not concern any one else." 
               "How excitable these young men are," said Sharp, chuckling. "Fire and flame, kicking off the cover and flying out of the pot! My dear sir, I meant no insult, and it was not mere curiosity made me ask the question. For I respect you highly, and owe you thanks for your timely assistance." 
               "My timely assistance? When?" 
               "When that bloodthirsty monster was locked in with me, yesterday evening. Aha, it may be a very good joke for Monsieur Tourtelotte to frighten a timid, lonely man with his hounds and his beasts, but he earns no good will thereby, I tell you; he earns no good will thereby. But to return to yourself, Mr. Welland, if you will permit me." 
                
               "If I am a sufficiently interesting subject for you, sir," said Welland, reluctantly, "which I rather doubt." 
               "I never talk of what doesn't interest me," returned Mr. Sharp, without heeding the young man's manner. "A surveyor, you say? What a queer business for a Jew. An Israelite and a surveyor-I can't understand it. I can't make it out." 
               "Perhaps it is not necessary." 
               "But it is. Now, what a pity! Here is our little Antonia, just in the age when she should--. But no. A surveyor? That can not be. What a pity!" 
               "Sir," cried Welland, "all patience has bounds." As long as you talk of me, I must suffer you to do so. But pray, leave Miss Goldman out of the question." 
               "My dear Mr. Welland, I am not likely to talk ill of her. I have carried her in my arms too often, and love her too much, the dear child! But, I merely express one of my most fervent wishes, in saying that I should like to see Miss Goldman married, and married to one of her own religion, who in other respects was worthy of her." 
               Welland was silent, while Sharp scrutinized his features with those ferret eyes. 
               "You forget," said the young man at last. "How recent a friend of the family I am. I think highly of Mr. and Mrs. Goldman and their daughter, but am not sufficiently interested in Miss Goldman's future husband, to make him a subject of conjecture." 
                
               "Are you not?" asked Sharp, slyly. "Oh no! Of course not. How can you be? Not at all." 
               "What in the world do you mean?" 
               "Mean? Nothing. You know there are old fools, that imagine they can read young men's faces. But that is all bosh. No! How can you be interested in such a thing? Not you, certainly. But our neighbor Tourtelotte is." 
               "You speak in enigmas, Mr. Sharp?" 
               "Do I? That is one of my ways. Sharp is no fool, however. He hasn't get any learning, and has what Madame la Generale calls 'horrid manners.' He may eat his soup like a horse, and grease his boots instead of blacking them, which is injurious to leather. But Sharp can see through a millstone, as far as any body." 
               With this, Mr. Sharp closed one eye, and with the other, gazed into the millstone aforesaid, in a manner that must have penetrated any sublunary millstone what ever. 
             
             
               CHAPTER X. 
               AT the distance of a couple of miles from the old town of Sycamore, surrounded by venerable pine woods, was a race course, which the people of the neighborhood frequently made use of. It was a mile track, and always kept in excellent condition.-The immense lawn which it encircled was level as a board, and the sombre woods that arose at a little distance from its external margin, seemed the dark walls of a vast Rotunda. It was a beautiful spot. The sunlit green of the lawn required no better set-off than the dark gloom of the pines. 
               There were two classes in the neighborhood, that matched their horses on this course. The one, consisting of plain farmers and small proprietors, brought horses of their own rearing. The other, was made up of wealthy town-folks, and of the owners of great landed estates. These ran horses of northern and foreign breed, and also fancy stock of their own raising. Among the first class, betting was moderate, and professionals staid away, because there was little chance of fleecing. But the races of the more aristocratic fanciers, attracted the usual number of blacklegs and scoundrels. High betting was the rule at these latter races. People would come from the adjoining counties in their carriages, and the elite of the neighborhood depended in a measure on the races, for meeting their friends. Now and then, the two classes would join in an affair on a larger scale, and then, there would be something like a ball in the evening for the plain folks, and a reception at a private house, for the prouder classes. 
               It was about two months after the events related in the preceding chapters, that one of the aristocratic races was to come off. Welland had been surveying in the neighborhood, during most of this time. He had been a frequent guest of the Goldmans; sometimes dropping in for dinner, and again stopping for a couple of days. The cordial reception always given, and the urgent invitations to repeat his visit as often as possible, moved him to ride to Pineland more frequently, than his own prudence sanctioned. True, he was always busy erecting and strengthening the wall, that was to separate him from Antonia. But it was to little purpose. It was like those buildings of German legends, where the fairies undo at night what the masons have accomplished during the day. One ride with the young lady, nay, a glance and a smile, would often tear down what he had labored to build up for weeks. 
               Meanwhile he was high in favor with the other members of the family. Having established, beyond a doubt, that the disputed hillside belonged to Mr. Goldman, he was petted by Mrs. Goldman, in return. This lady, moreover, was secretly impressed by the young man's distinguished air, and by the mystery which she supposed to underlie his history and position. Mr. Goldman simply liked him. But Madame la Generate, to whose reminiscences he lent a polite ear, absolutely doted on him. It had not happened to her for a long time, to find a gentleman young, handsome and well-bred, who took such interest in the affairs of the first empire, and who listened with such unremitting courtesy to the relations of court scandal, that implicated people ple now mostly dead, or in their dotage. 
               Welland's relations to Tourtelotte had undergone a slight change. As he endeavored to become cold to Antonia, so he stimulated himself to an exhibition of greater cordiality toward this young Creole. No one knew better how to charm, than he. In consequence of his exertions, then, Tourtelotte's friendship for him increased. But the reaction of this stimulation made Welland almost indifferent to Tourtelotte. He had been the latter's guest once or twice, but their tastes were too incompatible to make a long stay very agreeable. Nevertheless Tourtelotte insisted on riding about with Welland, and thus introduced him to half the good houses in the county. 
               We were saying that a race was about to take place. There was a numerous assembly of lookers on. Vehicles of all sorts, filled with all sorts of people, were gathered near the judges stand. Carriages containing whole families, together with servants, formed points of attraction for the ladies and gentlemen on horseback. Here and there these groups assumed considerable dimensions. It was a gay sight. The ladies wore habits of bright colors, in the English style, while some of the gentlemen indulged in light clothes. The pleasant laugh and chatter of females was heard everywhere, and all present seemed determined to make merry. 
               Welland was there. A close fitting black velvet riding suit showed his figure to advantage vantage. His horse, though not a very valuable animal, looked nicely. And the tout ensemble of the man was tasteful, quiet and distinguished. 
               In a roomy carriage sat the Goldman family. Madame la Generale was dressed in purple and fine linen, and displayed the graces of fifty years ago. Mrs. Goldman set the female world in agitation, by the display of a bonnet, newly imported from France. Her diamonds were the finest on the ground. Mr. Goldman and Sharp occupied the front seat, and conversed about business. 
               Antonia was on her pony, in the light blue habit. She came escorted by Tourtelotte, who had entered one of his horses. When they arrived on the ground, Tourtelotte galloped to Welland, and requested him to take charge of the young lady. He himself had some arrangements to perfect regarding his horse, that was to run. So Welland and Miss Goldman rode over the ground together, and they made a very handsome couple, as, flushed with exercise, they came in on their heated animals, and stopped in the neighborhood of the Goldman carriage. Mr. Sharp immediately closed one eye, and with the other gazed into his millstone. 
               Meanwhile, Tourtelotte had ridden to the stand, where he met our old acquaintance Hassel. They exchanged a few hasty words, and compared their betting books. Then Hassel said: 
                
               "I have seen the horses, Make only light bets on your gray mare, for she'll not come in first. You can go into partnership with me." 
               "With you? Excuse me," said Tourtelotte, proudly. 
               "I don't think it would hurt your pride to pocket a few thousands to-day, Mr. Tourtelotte." 
               "But how can it be done, if the gray loses?" 
               "By becoming my partner. I'll bet heavily against her." 
               "Will you find people to take your bets?" 
               "Plenty, if you'll introduce me?" 
               "Very well," said Tourtelotte. "I need money. Consider me your partner for to-day." 
               "All right sir. See, whether it doesn't pay." 
               "Excuse me for a moment. I will be with you presently." Tourtelotte cantered back to Miss Goldman, to make apologies for absenting himself until the race was over. While still engaged in this, the impatient Hassel joined the group, and with his usual impertinence, said: 
               "Beg your pardon Mr. Tourtelotte, but the time is short. I apologize to the lady for my intrusion." 
               Tourtelotte could not escape presenting him to Miss Goldman, and also to Welland. The young lady bowed, smiling affably. Welland looked straight at Hassel, as if he was so much empty air, and did not seem to notice the introduction. When Hassel bowed to him, he changed not a feature, but deliberately turned his back to the gambler. 
               The two partners galloped off. 
               "Mr. Tourtelotte's friend seems to be a stranger in this region," said Antonia. She had, with surprise, noticed Welland's manner, and now, following the others with her eyes, saw Tourtelotte introduce Hassel to a group of the first gentlemen of the neighborhood. 
               "I believe so," replied Welland, in an absent way. 
               "I hoped that I cured you of dreaming," laughed Antonia. "But you are so deep in thoughts, that I believe you did not notice that a gentleman was introduced to you." 
               "I beg a thousand pardons. Have I annoyed you?" 
               "And if you have?" A roguish smile showed her ravishing teeth, between her parted lips. 
               "I should be deserving of your displeasure. I know of no severer punishment to me on earth." His voice had grown deep and earnest. As he spoke the concluding words, it became that heart-voice, which, when we hear it, convinces us at once, that the speaker has given expression to his deepest feelings. 
               Antonia blushed, and cast down her radiant eyes. There was a moment of silence lence, during which these two were unconscious of all the world beside; when the bright heavens and the dark woods, the prancing horses and the chatting people, existed not for them. They seemed bewildered, floating away in empty space, carried by a will not their own, and in a direction, they knew not whither. 
               This reverie was broken by Madame la Generale, who called Welland, and requested the couple to come within speaking distance of the carriage. They walked their horses to either side of the vehicle. Welland could not help observing Mr. Sharp, who, one eye closed, had with the other been taking a look into his millstone, and seemed to have derived much satisfaction therefrom, for he sported that sort of grin, which a man puts on, when he says: I told you so! This expression, however, gave way to one of terror, as Welland's horse put his nose out toward him. 
               "For heaven's sake turn that animal," he cried. "It is looking at me with fiery eyes, and horses have been known to bite." 
               "I'll promise you this will not make any such attempt." 
               "Perhaps. But they can bite if they choose." 
               "Very few have been known to choose," said Mr. Goldman. 
               "Still, I will not be at the mercy of a horse's caprices," replied Mr. Sharp. 
               The horse was placed in a different position, and Madame la Generale secured Welland's attention to a reminiscence of her own, in which there was a lengthy account of a race at the Imperial Court, where His Majesty the King of Naples had insisted on riding his own horse, and had appeared in full uniform as marshal of France, with sword and plumes, to do so. And how somebody had said, that he should have carried the sceptre in his hand. Whereupon Murat replied, that, though he did not carry this sceptre, he carried an excellent whip for impertinent persons. 
               At this moment the signal was given, and the horses started. There were three competitors for the first prize. A splendid four year old progeny of Black Hawk, took the lead. Then followed, close to him, Tourtelotte's gray mare, a rather heavy animal, but of large stride and immense power. Third and last came a bay mare, with an awkward head, and big body, and legs that, though long and powerful, were not at all well looking. This mare had been raised in the county, and was put upon the course by a farmer, who endured the jokes on her appearance, with great equanimity. The horses were all ridden by mulatto boys. 
               The two horses that had the lead, increased the distance between them and the farmer's mare, for a little while. Finally the latter seemed to understand that this was a race, and with a snort she throw up her head, until her nose was parallel to her ears, and bounded off like a stag flying before fore the hounds. A moment, and she had reached the other horses; another, and she had passed them. "Claiborne," as the farmer had named her, proved the winner. Those immense joints, and awkward looking limbs, had been of good service. A quarter of an hour ago, no one would have given two hundred dollars for the horse, now the farmer was offered thousands. But he patted Claiborne, and refused all offers. 
               As Welland turned his head, he met Hassel's eye, who had approached him. The gambler frowned, and whispered: 
               "You have declared war against me. Take heed to yourself. Remember, Louis Welland, that all means are fair in self-defense." And he rode off. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XI. 
               THE widow Waddlekins was an important personage in Sycamore. Her house stood on the principal street. Her family was as old as the Alleghanies. And her respectability was above proof. 
               She had been a beauty in her youth. At least she said so. And what ladies say in regard to their charms, is always true. It would have been difficult to discover it now. But no matter. She said it had been so. At present, she was very stout. Corpulent she called it. Corpulent it was, beyond a doubt. 
               Her means were rather limited. Her grandfather had possessed fabulous wealth, she said, but in a moment of ill-judged benevolence, had liberated his slaves. That was long ago, in Virginia. From that period, the family had declined. Mrs. Waddlekins herself had married Mr. Waddlekins when quite young. He made ducks and drakes of the remnants of her grandfather's fortune, and when he had reduced the family possessions to a mere competence, he died in a highly respectable manner, and was buried with all the honors of a good citizen, a regular church-member, and a loving husband. From that moment, Mrs. Waddlekins began to grow fat, and to assume a prominent position in town. Her black gown and widow's cappresided at all meetings and parties, and no evening amusement was thought to have received the baptism of respectability if Mrs. Waddlekins was absent. 
               Providence had furnished this venerable lady with a family anecdote, which was forever her pride, and the stock of her conversation. It seems that in the revolutionary war, her grandfather of benevolent and slave-liberating memory, had inclined somewhat to peace doctrines, and conceived that he might be able to put an end to the bloodshed going on. Full of this idea, he presented himself in camp at General Washington's tent, and remonstrated with him on the sinfulness of waging war. The general listened to his arguments, and then replied, that it was the British who waged war against him, and that he should be very happy to stop, if they would let him. Further conversations developed a friendship between the great General and the eccentric old man, and the name of Washington lived in the family, as that of one, in whose glory they claimed a share. Mrs. Waddlekins had a picture of the great man in every room of her house. On one he was portrayed as sitting with icy composure upon a high stepping horse, with his hat in one hand, and the other forever pointing at the American flag. On another, he was in the position of a soldier, with black small clothes, a white apron, and a hat over his eyes, and masonic emblems scattered wildly about. Again, he galloped over a mass of cannons, and British soldiers, pointing proudly to the upper right hand corner of the gilded frame, with a sword, that was twice as long as himself. Sitting at a table with his family, and dying in his bed-in short, in every possible and many impossible positions, Mrs. Waddlekins possessed portraits of the General, and averred that each and every one of them was a true likeness. 
               She also had a daughter, and she made the most of her. Miss Waddlekins was soft-hearted, and full of romantic notions. She had more kindness than sense, and more sense than beauty, and more beauty than grace. Whenever she broke out into the old song: "Youth has departed!" she made a perfectly correct assertion in regard to herself. 
                
               Louis Welland had been kindly accepted as a boarder by Mrs. Waddlekins, during his stay in Sycamore. She did so merely to accommodate him, for, as Mrs. Waddlekins observed to a circle of female friends: "No one could presume to think that the pecuniary recompense was an object to her." "Of course not," echoed all. "It was very kind of Mrs. Waddlekins to be friend the young man." 
               On the evening of the day on which the races had been held, there was a reception at the Mayor's house, and Welland was destined to escort Mrs. and Miss Waddlekins thither. Of course there was no supper before going, but the elder lady made a cup of tea, to stay their stomach. A negress of fabulous age, who formed the only representative of that order, whom Mrs. Waddlekins styled "her servant," brought it, in cups of curious old China, full of cracks. The teaspoons were of silver, but worn down to a sharp edge, and bettered and straightened again until they had lost all shape. Both ladies were in gala costume. Mrs. Waddlekins wore black satin, a dress that had been much admired twenty years before. It is true, the shape of the waist was old-fashioned, and beside being cut low, it ended in a sharp point before and behind. Also on account of the corpulency of the wearer it was impossible to fasten more than two hooks at the top. But the formidable breach thus left open, was deftly covered by a cashmere shawl, which Mrs. Waddlekins never laid aside. There was a perfect plantation of artificial flowers on her head. Miss Waddlekins languished in white, with a juvenile sash of pink tarletan. Both ladies sat down with exceeding care, and took their tea with suitable precautions. 
               The Mayor's house was brilliantly illuminated. The parlors were handsomely adorned with flowers, and a band of three musicians allured the young to the sitting-room, where dancing was going on. The old people played cards in the library. 
               Welland, after depositing his charges, the one in the library, and the other in the ball room, looked for Miss Goldman. She was not in the house. He searched the garden. Leaning against an old, upright trunk, covered with ivy, stood Antonia, bathed in the bright rays of the moon. She was deep in thoughts. As Welland approached, she turned and blushed, and accepted his arm. They walked slowly up and down. 
               He never knew, or could recollect what they talked of, in that bright moonshiny walk under the trees. He was scarce conscious of what he said, or of what she replied. He seemed to be walking on clouds, and talking without any voluntary effort. All he remembered was, that he felt supremely happy, and that she was leaning on his arm, and her eyes were looking into his, and that finally he was left at the door of the library, with a tuberose in his hand, which she had given him. 
                
               He had little time to regain his composure, for Madame la Generale immediately called him: 
               "My dear Mr. Welland, pray sit down here. I have been playing whist, and have lost constantly. As His Majesty was wont to observe: I have no luck at these English games, owing to the faults of my partners." 
               Mrs. Waddlekins was Madame's partner. She bridled immediately. 
               "Mr. Welland," she cried, "General Washington was in the habit of remarking to my grandfather; The French are a perfect nation. They never commit any faults. They attribute them to others." 
               This was the signal for war. Madame's country had been attacked. She feigned not to notice the stout body of her opponent, but seemed to look straight through her at a distant landscape, and said: 
               "What a pity the emperor never turned his attention to America! He might have annexed it, notwithstanding the patriotism of its large women." 
               "They do not know what a good figure is in France," said Mrs. Waddlekins, laying her hand on Welland's left arm. "Their great emperor was little more than a dwarf. Washington was a man of proper height, as my grandfather often said." 
               "The emperor, my dear sir," said Madame, taking possession of his right arm, with her fan, "never wore a wig, which is more than can be said of great American Generals, or their devoted admirers." 
                
               "If you mean me, Madame," cried Mrs. Waddlekins, "I have more hair now, than ladies in France ever possess, as I am told." 
               "Did you do me the honor of making a remark?" inquired Madame, blandly turning to her opponent, as if she had just become aware of her presence. "Excuse me, I was about relating to Mr. Welland an anecdote of His Majesty the emperor Napoleon." 
               "Was it about the sale of Louisiana to the United States, Madame?" asked the other, with a show of great interest. 
               "No; it was a remark on the sham-marriage of Miss Patterson with his brother?" 
               "Indeed, Madame? The emperor was fit to talk on such a subject. Was his marriage with Josephine a sham also?" 
               "His Majesty said," continued Madame, heedless of the interruption, "don't let him marry an American lady. When they get old, they always grow stout and vulgar." 
               Mrs. Waddlekins grew red as a turkey-cock. Serious difficulties might have occurred, had not Welland hastened to the piano, and struck a number of loud accords, which soon brought Miss Waddlekins to his side, who at once began to sing to his accompaniment: "Youth has departed!" 
               In the meanwhile, Tourtelotte had left off dancing, and retired to the smoking-room room, where Hassel had spent the greater part of the evening. This room was upstairs, and overlooked the garden. Hassel was alone at the moment, and busily engaged in emitting the smoke from his mouth, in a number of perfect rings, following each other in slow succession. 
               "Shall I hand you your money," he asked, as Tourtelotte emptied a glass of brandy, and then lighted a cigar. 
               "No," replied the other, gloomily. "I doubt whether I can consider it fairly won." 
               "You don't mean it," laughed Hassel. "Why, wasn't it fairly won?" 
               "Because I bet against my own horse." 
               "Why, it's done every day on the turf." 
               "But I am not a gentleman of the turf." 
               "Still I can not understand your scruples." 
               "That is perfectly plain. I never thought you could." 
               Hassel's face flushed. "I only know that, had we lost, I should have expected you to pay one half of the losses." 
               "I would have done so." 
               "Very well. Perhaps you are rich enough to incur such a risk, without the expectation of pocketing the money when you win. I am not. Nor would any of those who lost this money, have shown the slightest hesitation to pocket yours, had fortune gone against you." 
               "That is true." 
               "Here is your money," and Hassel held out the bills in a tempting manner. But Tourtelotte averted his eyes. The other placed them on the table, and turned his back. Tourtelotte gazed furtively at the money. He needed it. Of late his losses had been heavy. He could not afford to despise the first smiles of fortune. A step on the staircase, decided him. Quickly pocketing the bills he rose, and coming to Hassel's side, said with affected carelessness: 
               "Do you study the effects of moonlight on the trees of the garden?" 
               "No," replied the other. "I am trying to discover whether the lovers are still there." 
               "What lovers," asked Tourtelotte, glad to talk of any thing, that would silence the voice of his heart, which reproached him for taking money not fairly won. 
               "The lovers we saw this morning at the races." 
               "Whom do you mean? I don't recollect any lovers?" 
               "Why, the lady in the blue habit and-" 
               "The lady in the blue habit? You are dreaming, I believe." 
               "Is she not engaged to the gentleman who was at her side? To the one that-" 
               "That discovered you cheating at brag in Memphis?" said Tourtelotte, sneering. "No. She is engaged to no one, and I insist upon your speaking of her with the highest respect, if you speak of her at all, which is not desirable." 
                
               "I beg your pardon. A cat may look at a king." 
               "Yes, but at a very respectful distance. Was she in the garden?" 
               "In the early part of the evening. She stood leaning against the old trunk at the further end, when the gentleman came and gave her his arm. After that, they walked up and down for a while. I thought that their heads were close together-" 
               "Take care, what you say!" 
               "The moonbeams probably dazzled me. When they turned their faces this way, it seemed as if both were radiant with happiness-" 
               "You are talking nonsense. Take care!" 
               "It must have been the light of the moon, which made their faces shine so. As they are not engaged, I probably was deceived. The lady had a bouquet of tuberoses." 
               "Which I gave her this evening. What more?" 
               "Nothing. Calm yourself. Somebody is coming." 
               "It is Welland," said Tourtelotte, with a shudder, as his friend entered the room. 
               "And there is a tuberose in his button hole," whispered Hassel, lighting another cigar. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XII. 
               FROM the window of a Fifth Avenue mansion, streamed masses of light. The heavy damask curtains were looped back, and the airy lace permitted outsiders a glance at the splendors within. In truth, it appeared as if guests were expected, for there was an air of preparation in these fine apartments, which it is as impossible to conceal in a palace as in a hovel. Nor did appearances deceive. Guests were expected, but only one; still that one was the master of the mansion. 
               Two ladies sat in the parlor, fanning themselves, with the nervousness begotten of expectation. The elder was a short, stout personage, quietly dressed. She had a kind, honest face, with small blue eyes, cheeks like those of an apple, and hair sprinkled with gray. The younger was a tall, queenly figure, with clearly cut features, deep, dark eyes, of magnificent gray, and hair like a Cleopatra. She was dressed in a robe of cherry colored silk, and wore a red camelia on her head. 
               Now a carriage dashed along the street, and stopped at the house. The hall door flew open, and in the blaze of light streaming out, an elderly gentleman dismounted, and entered. The young lady's arms were around his neck in an instant, and he held her close to his breast. They were father and daughter. 
               When this embrace relaxed, and the elder der lady had been treated to a good old-fashioned hug, two facts became evident. First, that the gentleman was Reichenau, the Tennessee merchant, and secondly, that the old lady was his sister. They looked very much alike. 
               After a few more greetings, while Reichenau patted his daughter on that magnificent head, as if she had been a child, he said laughing: 
               "Now Margaret and Emma, I must retire to brush up. For, at present, I am the only shabby object here." 
               And he ran up-stairs, leaving both with a glow of happiness upon their faces. Presently he returned, and they all went in to dinner. What brilliancy! The walls of the dining-room were covered with velvetty paper, red as blood. The carpets were of the same hue. There was a chandelier with four jets, and on every wall were four burners, bearing milk-white globes with their fiery cores. Imagine all this light reflected from the crimson walls, and sparkling upon the silver and crystal of the table, and you will be dazzled by the picture. 
               During the meal, Reichenau's daughter lavished tender attentions upon him, while his sister seemed to watch both with a happy smile. With the adjournment to the parlor, conversation recommenced, for the merchant had been too hungry, and too happy to say much before that time. 
               "Oh father," said Emma, "the last season at Saratoga was much more brilliant than that of the summer before. There were so many distinguished men there." 
               "And the last season at Memphis was much more profitable than that of the year before. Wool and iron were sold at great advantage." 
               "Oh, bah," said Emma, with a proud smile. "What do I care for wool or iron? Father, you should have seen me at the last ball at Saratoga. I wore a wreath of golden ears of wheat, and bouquets of the same, scattered over a crimson dress. Aunt Mag said, I looked so grand and terrible, she was afraid of me." 
               "And what did the distinguished gentlemen say?" asked the father, smiling. 
               "The Hon. Mr. J-, who had been ambassador to England said, that he never saw any thing more magnificent at the Queen's court." 
               "Indeed? And did you see Mr. Douglas there?" 
               "Only once. And he paid me a beautiful compliment." 
               "In the stump speech style?" 
               "How can you be so wicked!" with a pout. "He said, it was fortunate he had not seen me years ago, for then he would have searched for the objects of his life in New York, instead of in Washington. And guess what I replied?" 
               "Well?" 
               "That years ago I did not exist! Then, all laughed, and Mr. Douglas said it was a cruel reminder to him of his age. You know that he will be President." 
               "I don't know that, my youthful politician." 
               "Oh the company settled it at Saratoga! The south will vote for him, notwithstanding the other candidates." 
               "Did you meet many people there from the south?" 
               "Quite a number. But especially one." 
               "A young gentleman from Tennessee," said aunt Margaret, with a droll glance at her brother. 
               "Ah? What part of the State does he come from?" 
               "From Claiborne County. His name is Goldman." 
               "And he is very agreeable," resumed Emma, lifting her head proudly. "But you will have an opportunity of seeing him. He may come to-night." 
               A cloud passed over Reichenau's brow. "I might have preferred to pass this evening with you alone," he said, "but never mind. I know the county he comes from, and have done business with a neighbor of his. Mr. Tourtelotte, for whose harvest I have contracted for several years, and who owes me a great deal of money, is the suitor of a Miss Goldman. Probably this young man is her brother." 
               "He must be. For he has spoken of a sister at home." 
               "They are very wealthy, as matters go in Tennessee." 
                
               "He is an agreeable young man, and has distinguished manners. I know that you will be pleased with him, father." 
               "And how has Emma got on in her studies?" asked Reichenau. "Shall I hear good music while at home, or must I lend my ear to fashionable waltzes?" 
               "Oh, I will play whatever you wish, father. Yes, even Beethoven, whom I abominate, and all his long drawn sonates." 
               "No, child. Beethoven, whom you abominate, you wont play, for you can't. If it must be, I can be very content with Bellini, and his compeers. But how is Mendelssohn?" 
               "I don't understand him; and when I had read Miss Sheppard's novels, and tried to get into the spirit of his pieces, it made my skin creep." 
               "What sensitive nerves!" laughed the father. "If it makes your skin creep to reflect on Mendelssohn's music, how would it make you feel, to listen to the thunders of Fingal's Cave, or experience the Nocturnes of Italy's melodious nights." 
               "Father," cried the girl, with beaming eyes. "You are going to treat us to a trip to Europe. Isn't that the sense of what you were saying? Oh, I'll play Mendelssohn for ever, if I can pass a winter in Paris." 
               "No Emma, I did not mean that. The state of our country is too unsettled in a political point of view, for me to leave at present." 
                
               "No one feels uneasy at the state of the country. The greatest politicians of the land have told me at Saratoga, that all those were merely election phrases, which came into play once every four years." 
               "I know that, child. But we foreigners fear that this time they are not merely phrases, and I think we are better judges in this case than the Americans themselves. So you wish to visit Europe?" 
               "Oh yes. Every one has been there. I want to be presented at the court of France, and I want to get corals from Naples, and those pretty Florentine ornaments, and Roman shawls, and no end of other things. Then we must go to Switzerland, to purchase some of those nice wooden carvings. One can get them almost for nothing." 
               "And not to see the Alps, but merely to get carvings?" 
               "Well, we would see the Alps by the way. I have heard that in summer the most fashionable people of Europe go to Switzerland." 
               Reichenau laughed. "You must wait a while," he said, "we can not go this year. I am afraid that the court of France will not have an opportunity of admiring my daughter as yet. And the Alps and carvings in wood, will have to wait too." 
               "I will be very good, if you take us next summer. I shall bring the Paris fashions for winter home then, and shall be the first to wear them." 
                
               "Be good for goodness sake, Emma." 
               "I should like to, but it is so tiresome to be good. It is not at all amusing, father." 
               "I am afraid your tastes are corrupt. Is wickedness amusing then?" 
               "Yes, very. The most amusing people in the world are the wicked fellows, and I never have more fun than when I do something very wicked." 
               "I suppose you are a great criminal, then. What wicked things have you done lately?" 
               "Do you want to know? And wont aunt be angry?" 
               "Oh, am I concerned?" asked aunt Margaret, looking up from her book. 
               "Yes, you are. Do you remember when the Hadleys called last week? Those very stiff, polite old maids? They stayed to lunch, and I bribed Andrew to pour vinegar into their glasses from a wine bottle, instead of wine. And aunt urged them continually to take wine, and the poor things had to swallow half their vinegar, ere they were done. But they stood it like heroes. Never moved a muscle, while I thought I should have exploded with laughter." 
               "That's why they grew so serious and silent after lunch," said aunt Mag. "Poor things, what an opinion they must have of our cellar." 
               "Are there more confessions of the same sort?" asked Reichenau, laughing. 
               "Yes. I poisoned Mrs. Cholmondeley's parrot." 
                
               "Great heavens!" cried the aunt, springing up. "And then you went to comfort the poor lady, who almost broke her heart over it! You arrant hypocrite!" 
               "I was really sorry for it afterwards, but it was great fun." 
               "Then," resumed Reichenau, "the pleasures of wickedness consist in making old ladies drink vinegar, and poisoning poll parrots. Very fine, I must confess." 
               A ring was heard. The merchant sat up straight in his chair, and Emma threw herself on a lounge in a most picturesque position, making a perfect blaze of cherry colored silk around her. She picked up an album, and seemed to grow unconscious of surrounding objects. 
               The girl was perfectly beautiful; a beauty only marred by the consciousness of it, which she had not sufficient art or high breeding to conceal. She was in her seventeenth or eighteenth year, and fully developed. Her taste in dress was magnificent, and, therefore, well suited to the style of her face and form. She reclined there, with the ample folds of red silk surging around her; soft, foamy lace dragged over it in ribands; and her white warm throat and queenly face rose out of this blaze of color with the magnificence of a Cleopatra, and the grace of a swan. 
               A young man entered the parlor. He was lithe and graceful, with sea-blue eyes and sunny hair, and a moustache of the palest golden hue. His dress-coat was exquisite quisite, his gloves unexceptionable, and his smile bewitching. It was Mr. Charles Goldman. 
               After due introduction, Mr. Reichenau ascertained that Mr. Goldman was a neighbor of Mr. Tourtelotte, and then he entered into a long description of Claiborne County. Emma, who had greeted Mr. Goldman's entrance with a nod, relapsed into her state of seeming unconsciousness. Aunt Mag was nervously busy in asking her brother questions, which he replied to by long remarks addressed to Mr. Goldman. 
               Of a sudden, there was a sharp bark, and a joyful rush to the arm-chair. Floss, Emma's spaniel, a perfect mass of long silky hair, white as snow, had recognized her father, and leaped upon his lap. This diversion gave Mr. Goldman an opportunity to move to the lounge, nor was he slow in availing himself of it. Mr. Reichenau immediately said: 
               "Emma, give us some music. I must hear all your new airs, for, remember, in a week I am going back to Tennessee!" 
               "So soon!" exclaimed Charles Goldman. "Do you not like New York better, than merely to give it a week?" 
               "You may well imagine that I do not go because I prefer Tennessee. But my business requires it." 
               "Surely, you are above the necessity of sacrificing your wishes to your business." 
               "No man is. I was a poor boy when I came to this country, and had I ever thought so, I would never have acquired what I possess." 
               Emma had opened the piano. Charles turned the music. As he bent over her, she raised her eyes to his, and a glance of warm affection passed between the two. The keys rattled, and Reichenau cried out: 
               "Emma, keep time. What are you thinking of?" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               WHEN Charles Goldman took his leave, he hastened to a club house, where he had promised to meet a young friend. The club house of the Upatens was situated on -- street. It possessed a reading-room and hall on the first floor, and a number of card-rooms up-stairs. The apartments on the first floor opened into each other, and on the occasion of entertainments, represented a continuous suite. 
               It happened to be the evening when an amateur concert was to be given, which would finish with a dance. Goldman's friend met him in the hall. He was one of the old youngsters to be noticed in the clubs of New York. Young in years, but old in worldly cunning, with dissipation written in the weary look of his eyes. His sallow relaxed face, and slim, short body, bespoke a stunted growth. His name was Ed. Merrins. 
               After a warm greeting, the two entered the parlors, where Merrins pointed out to Goldman the ladies most in fashion. 
                
               "There are Mrs. and Miss Gogalow," he said, pointing to a mother and daughter, alike thin, with pale, weazened faces, and large, dark eyes. Both were horridly overdressed, and be-hung with chains like Japanese idols. "They are very rich, but have only moved to New York recently. Wholesale dry goods." 
               They moved on. 
               "There," continued Merrins, glancing at a very pretty girl with a pert expression on her handsome features, "is the only daughter of Kuckelein & Co, importers of watches." 
               He bowed to the lady. The next group was a parcel of fat women, with yellow complexions, mere fragments of noses, and plenty of diamonds. 
               "These are the rich Bockheims," nudged Merrins. "They live on Fifth Avenue, and have made mints of money. Gentlemen's furnishing goods." 
               A crowd of beautiful girls stood laughing in a corner. 
               "Who are those?" asked Goldman. 
               "Those? Let me see; I don't know. Very pretty, aint they? But no considerable firms among them." 
               "There are very few gentlemen here." 
               "They are in the card-rooms. The concert will call them down." 
               Presently it began. The ladies entered the hall in the rear of the parlors, and took their seats upon the chairs and benches that filled it. The gentlemen grouped themselves in the rear of the ladies. Still there was a great preponderance of the fair sex, which Merrins explained, by saying that a great many preferred to remain in the card-rooms. 
               A young man mounted the platform at the further end of the hall, and performed a piece upon the piano. There was rapturous applause. 
               "Isn't it splendid?" cried Merrins. "He studied at Leipzic for two years, and spent ten thousand dollars in Europe. He is a great artist." 
               "He plays well, but not well enough to merit all those encomiums. Who is he?" 
               "Wertheim & Co. Eldest son. Was made partner this Spring. Shirt manufacturers." 
               A lady of exceeding stoutness was now led forward. In size she promised as much as Albini. But there the resemblance ended to a great degree. Still she sang a Bravour Aria with a good deal of brilliancy, and was encored. This lady, who would have been majestic in heavy silks, wore gossamer white, while innocent rosebuds were stuck in her hair. 
               "Who is she?" inquired Charles, who was delighted with her voice. 
               "Oh, nobody. A Miss Levy, daughter of a school teacher." 
               Then came a slim, pale youth. His hair flowed back from a forehead bright with the light of genius. His large tremulous eyes ignored the audience. With long transparent fingers he lifted a violin, and the bow swept over the strings. Sounds of passion, tones of heart-music floated from his instrument; now low as a cello, it spoke of the depths to which the soul is cast down by the dominion of desire; then loud as a trumpet it sang of the heights to which it is lifted by love. In every note weighed the earnestness of an inspired soul. 
               When he ceased, there was a deep silence. The audience seemed to draw a long breath. Then rapturous applause burst forth. Those sensitive descendants of the Orient, educated or ignorant, refined or rough, had all realized and felt the poetry which expressed itself in that language of nature, the music of a master. There is a faint reflection of the palm trees and the rose-gardens, the deserts full of mirage, and the skies full of burning stars, in the heart of every one with a drop of eastern blood in his veins, that gifts him with a greater power of poetic appreciation than European nationalities possess. And here it was evident. 
               The young artist descended from the platform, and no one seemed to pay any further attention to him. As he picked his way to their neighborhood, Charles prepared to offer him his seat. But Merrins interfered. 
               "He is paid for his play. No necessity of being polite to him." 
               Just then eight gentlemen began on four pianos, to play the Coronation March from the Prophet. This march, horrible enough when played on a single piano, was eight times more horrible played thus. With it the concert ended, and the benches were removed to make room for the dancers. 
               "Shall I introduce you to a lady for the next quadrille?" asked Merrins. "There is Miss Babblapap-Babblapap & Son, wholesale liquors and Rhine wines; she is a splendid dancer." 
               The introduction was given, and Miss Babblapap accepted. 
               "How do you amuse yourself?" she asked Charles. 
               "Very well," he replied. "I have never been in better company." 
               "Yes, some very wealthy people are here. Did you observe Mrs. Bockheim?" 
               "She was pointed out to me. But I saw nothing to admire in her." 
               "Why, her diamonds are worth twenty thousand dollars." 
               After this dance, Charles looked on, until the call for supper was given. There was an immediate rush to the basement. 
               Kuckelein & Co fought her way with both elbows, dragging her cavalier along, and in the face looking perfectly indifferent to sublunary suppers. The Gogalows were in the first rank. The Bockheims, diamonds and all, were crowded back. When Charles gained a seat at the table, every body was in full process of mastication. There was a good deal of show of breeding among the ladies, as far as eating was concerned. Still the elder ones did not disdain to resort to sleights of hand, when the fork seemed insufficient. Many gentlemen used their knives like shovels, and forks were at a discount among them. 
               After supper, there was a merry party gathered at Charles' end of the table. Merrins, Wertheim, and some graduates of German universities, discussed good old wine there. Somehow the conversation turned on dogs, and somebody asked of Wertheim how his friend Tisso's dog was. 
               "Why, haven't you heard?" cried Wertheim. "Minnie is dead. Dead as a doornail." 
               "How," asked all. 
               Merrins told Charles that they referred to a splendid little black and tan, which belonged to Tisso the actor. 
               "It is a long story," said Wertheim. 
               "Tell it, by all means." 
               "Very well. You see Tisso came here last season on a visit to me. Booth is his intimate friend, and we had agreed to spend an evening with him. On the evening in question we proceeded to Booth's quarters, who was compelled to be out until nine, but who had asked a number of jolly fellows to meet us. It was near nine, when Tisso suddenly stopped in the midst of conversation, and cried: 'Where is Minnie?' We all searched. No Minnie was to be found. No reply to our calls. Not a sign of the dog. Finally we stumbled upon a closet half open, and on pushing the door, there lay Minnie, dead, dead as the last of the Mohegans. At this moment Booth arrived. Tisso rushed to meet him, crying: 'Have you any poison in your rooms?' 'I have poison in my rooms!' replied the actor in the same style. 'Then my dog is dead, my dog is dead!' shrieked Tisso. A medical man, who was of the party, was instantly taken hold of. He was dragged to the druggist and back, and forced to administer emetics, antidotes, and what not to the dead animal. But Minnie remained dead. Booth got a sheet, and the corpse was wrapped in it, while Tisso remained by its side, covering the pretty little head of the dead dog with kisses and tears. I never saw a man cry so. He sobbed as if his heart would break. So it was determined to fuddle him, in order to make him forget his grief. But, to no purpose. The more brandy we urged on him, the more he wept. We all entered the closet in turn, to hear him sob out the perfections of Minnie, and administer consolation. One said: 'Don't weep, you'll meet her in a better place above.' The other sighed: 'She was too good for this world.' Booth opined that 'she died in a good cause.' When I asked him why, he said: 'to furnish us an evening's amusement.' Everybody was drinking brandy to fuddle Tisso, and while Tisso remained sober, everybody else got fuddled. Each new burst of tears and moans from the mourner, gave rise to a paroxysm of laughter, and no end of witticisms. Finally, it became a question whether the dog should remain in Booth's rooms, or be taken home to my lodgings. He took him home. It was one of the hottest nights of the year. I emptied a shelf of my bookcase, and the dog was put there. All through the night Tisso continued to get up, unlocked the case, kissed and wept over the dog, and then came over to my bed, bowed his head over my shoulder, and cried like a mermaid. In the morning, Minnie's skin was delivered over to be stuffed, and her heart was put up in alcohol with the label: 'Minnie's heart.' That little heart was full of love for Tisso." 
               After a good laugh, the party went upstairs, and joined in the dance, which was still going on. As they were preparing to leave, Merrins excused himself, saying: 
               "Pardon me. I am going to take home a young lady, to whom I pay special attention. I have serious views in regard to her. They keep a carriage, and live in great style. Krakowwitz & Son, Chatham Street. Clothing and gentlemen's furniture." 
               But his intentions were frustrated; at the same moment a short, dark young man seized his arm, and said: "Merrins, why don't you dance?" 
               Merrins introduced him as "Mr. Beans, wholesale dry goods, Charleston and Mobile; family living in New York." 
                
               The young man bowed, and then continued to address Merrins: "My sisters are here. They would be glad to see you. Go and ask Sophie to dance." 
               Merrins glanced nervously at three short, dark girls, very plain and overdressed, who sat at a little distance, and had supported the part of wallflowers during most of the evening. 
               "I am about to go," he urged reluctantly. 
               "Stay a little longer," persisted Mr. Beans. "Dance with her. What do you care?" 
               "But I am very tired already," replied Merrins. 
               "I'll be down at your place to-morrow," said Beans. "I am purchasing a lot of shirtbosoms, and I'll take some of your house." 
               "We shall be happy to see you," replied Merrins with a smile, and at once asked Miss Sophie Beans to dance. That young lady started as if she had been deep in abstruse reflections, and oblivious of such trivial pleasures as dancing. She assented, however, and away they glided in the mazes of a waltz. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               NEARLY a couple of months had elapsed since the events related in the last chapter. Hassel had remained in Claiborne County, and was the constant companion of Tourtelotte, who suddenly seemed to take a deep interest in politics. It was not remarkable, at a time when political excitement ran so high, that a gentleman of Tourtelotte's standing should associate so closely with a man like Hassel, who was known to be a regular agent of a faction in the State. They visited together, and tried to organize the gentlemen of the county into a firm party, that would be ready to oppose a l'outrance, the faction of the small farmers and tradesmen in the vicinity. Of course it was not politics alone that were discussed. When a number of gentlemen rode over from their estates to Sycamore, and met in the large upper parlor of the hotel, punch flowed freely, and after discussions of a more serious nature, cards were produced, and social games of brag entered upon, with the vim of men relaxing after labor. It is needless to say that Hassel was not a loser at these relaxations. Tourtelotte also proved a winner frequently. His code of morals had become an easy one, and the strict laws of honor sat lightly on his mind. Sophistry, in the person of Hassel, was always at hand to explain away scruples, and smooth the approaches to doubtful actions. 
                
               Hassel, who needed Tourtelotte to further both his public and private ends, felt, aside from this, a great delight in leading the young man away from the paths of honor. Every time Tourtelotte accepted of the proceeds of some of his nicely laid schemes and dirty speculations, he triumphed in his heart, and was as full of joy as if he had taken a city. He looked upon every such act, on Tourtelotte's part, as an excuse for his own roguery, or rather as a justification. "All men are rogues," he said, chuckling to himself, after such a transaction. "But many want the opportunity, and the smartness." He took great delight in contemplating Tourtelotte's station, exalted ideas of honor, and chivalric reputation, his family associations, and every thing else that won the world's regard for the young man. Then he said: "Try them. They are all so." 
               It is a queer phenomenon that the best allurers to vice, are those who have experienced its sharpest retributions. Captive animals are used to decoy their wild brethren, and the hopelessly vicious, are the devil's surest agents. 
               It is easy to imagine that Hassel had used his influence to shake Welland's position in the county. The young German had been absent for over six weeks, surveying at a distant point, whither directions from the Capital had ordered him to go. He had just returned, and accepted a pressing invitation to pass a week at Pineland land. Before leaving, he had observed that people around Sycamore treated him with more coolness than previously, yet unconscious of cause, he had not given much thought to the matter. Nor did he, in fact, concern himself about it, as long as the Goldmans retained the old kindliness of feeling toward him. 
               There was a small tea-party at the widow Waddlekins. The table was set in the best room, and good things abounded thereon. The old china, and the sharp-edged tea-spoons, did their best to lend splendor to the entertainment, and the sugar tongs and cream pitcher gave evidence of past glories. 
               The widow sat enthroned upon a large and slippery horse hair sofa. This sofa possessed legs beautifully carved in the shape of cornucopias, with tremendous bird's claws on the pointed ends. Its back was surmounted by a perfect wilderness of mahogany fruits and flowers, which clustered around a piece of yellow wood let in, for greater splendor, and having the appearance of a blister denuded of skin. The arms were arabesques. The whole looked as if it might have belonged to Mrs. Waddlekin's grandfather's grandfather. 
               The ladies had sipped their tea, and eaten their cake, and the ancient attendant had left them to their own devices. Each had the pretence of work with her, and stitched away at a little bit of muslin, at the rate of one stitch to every ten words. Conversation was going on briskly, and if the fingers suggested the necessity of introducing the sewing machine, no one would have thought of inventing a talking machine, that could do any better than those ladies did with their unassisted natural powers. 
               "My husband told me so," said Mrs. Palmer. "He is paid by the abolitionists to sneak around the State, and spy out what we are going to do, in case they attempt to free our slaves." 
               "There is no such thing, Mrs. Palmer," returned Mrs. Waddlekins. "He has been residing in my house for weeks, and never has he been guilty of an attempt to turn my servants against me, or cause them to run away." It will be remembered that the widow's "servants" were Hannah, aged seventy and deaf as a post. 
               "Still, Mrs. Waddlekins, I have heard the same thing," said old Miss Quizzens. "He is very polite, and quite genteel. But if he is going to interfere with our institutions, he'd better take care, for tar wont improve his complexion." 
               "Are you going to condemn a man unheard?" asked Mrs. Waddlekins, raising her hands in an oratorial manner, and looking like a seal about to address his fellow-seals. "Who says these things about him, Miss Quizzens? Who calumniates my friend, Mrs. Palmer? Show me the woman, and I'll-I'll-I'll trample on her, and destroy her!" 
                
               This climax was terrible, and there was little doubt that the destruction would be complete, if the trampling took place, and Mrs. Waddlekins were the trampler. But she looked in vain for a tramplee.
                
               "Yes ladies," she resumed, "the General used to say to my grandfather-" 
               As soon as the rest heard the General mentioned they grew pale, and Mrs. Oglethorpe hastened to the rescue by interrupting the speaker, with the question: 
               "But are his feelings not those of an abolitionist?" 
               "Madam," returned Mrs. Waddlekins, with dignity, "I am a sorrowing widow, and not given to inquire into the feelings of the young men I entertain, and-" 
               "Board," suggested a lady. 
               "No, not board!" repeated Mrs. Waddlekins, throwing a scathing glance at the speaker, and rejecting the amendment with scorn. "No Waddlekins has ever kept a boarding house. The young men that become my guests." 
               "I hope he is an abolitionist," squeaked old Miss Hopstring, the school marm. "All men are free according to the constitution, and niggers are men." 
               "Pity one can't marry them," said a pert young miss, and the circle laughed. The fact was, old Miss Hopstring was from Massachusetts, and known to be a defender of the principles of the commonwealth. This was tolerated as a natural crotchet in a school marm. There was a rumor of Miss Hopstring being attached to a mulatto preacher, in a Platonic way, which always set the laugh against her. 
               "Ladies," resumed Mrs. Waddlekins, with the manner of a Cicero, "you know that I am the descendant of the bosom friend of our great southern General and statesman, George Washington. You know that rather than have our institutions broken down by the North, I would suffer myself to be hung up by the hair, and torn limb from limb by wild beastesses. If I therefore say, that I believe Louis Welland innocent, that settles the question." 
               All agreed, that that settled the question, and asked to be helped to another cup of tea. 
               "He has a beautiful moustache," said Mrs. Oglethorpe, who was a judge of such matters, possessing herself a not inconsiderable ornament of this kind. 
               "And his hair is so glossy; and his eyes so bright," cried Mrs. Smocklay, a young married woman, rather vulgar. 
               "If it had pleased Providence to spare me my dear Waddlekins," said the widow, turning her eyes up, "I would not think of other men's hair and eyes." 
               "Nor they of yours," replied Mrs. Smocklay, angrily. 
               "Why, my dear Mrs. Smocklay! you don't know what you are saying! I was considered the beauty of this section, before you were ever thought of." 
                
               "It must have been," returned the other, "before I was born." 
               "Excuse me," said the widow, bitterly, "you are neither so young nor I so old, that it could have been then. But it was before society had come to recognize your existence," and as the representative of society, she drew herself up proudly, with a glance at Mrs. Smocklay, that signified to that lady that she was addressing the granddaughter of Washington's bosom friend, and no mistake. 
               Upon which Mrs. Smocklay struck her colors, with a giggle intended to express contempt for the opponent, and revenged herself by silently demolishing an enormous quantity of cake. Mrs. Palmer, however, took up the glove. 
               "His complexion is very fair, if he is an abolitionist," she said, defiantly; "and I say it, if I am a married woman." 
               But a peacemaker interfered. 
               "Have you seen Miss Allen," asked the school marm. "Her face is spots all over, and the doctor says they wont go away." 
               "Mr. Tremaine will stop going to see her then, I suppose," said Mrs. Parsley. 
               "Yes, and right for her too," cried Mrs. Oglethorpe. "The vain thing that always dressed finer than her betters." 
               And thus more. Until the party broke up. 
               Next day, early in the forenoon, Mrs. Waddlekins was walking in her garden, when a gentleman joined her there, and bowed with great politeness. It was Hassel, dressed very elegantly. 
               "Pardon my intrusion, madam," he said. "But I was riding past, and over the paling could observe you walking among the flowers. To a man so full of worrying business as myself, there is nothing more soothing, than the view of a beauty surrounded by flowers." And he laid the tips of his fingers upon his left vest-pocket. 
               "Ah, my dear Mr. Hazelton, you flatter me. There was a time when such a compliment might have been justified, but now-," and Mrs. Waddlekins shook her head with gentle melancholy. 
               "Now, more than ever," cried Hassel, fervently. "Once a beauty, always a beauty. Years only develop the charms that ravish us poor men. And then my dear madam," he added, in affectionate reproof, "you can't be above thirty." 
               "Oh Mr. Hazelton! I have a grown up daughter. But, to be sure, I was only a child when I married Mr. Waddlekins." 
               "And you still remain true to him? Why have you never married?" and he squeezed the widow's hand. 
               The poor lady began to be fluttered. 
               "How can you ask such questions, you wicked man," she said, with a simper. 
               "I should have thought Mr. Welland, who was your guest for quite a time, would not have been able to resist the charms I now behold." And his glance fell upon her throat and double chin, which were heaving like the Red sea. 
               "Sir," said Mrs. Waddlekins, with stateliness, "Mr. Welland knew his place better than to entertain such foolish hopes." 
               "Perhaps your opinions did not agree with his? He is an emissary of the abolitionists. I used to see him in the North, and there is no greater hater of the South than he. But, let us talk of something else. How well pink becomes you." 
               "You don't say!" gasped the widow. "Mr. Welland an abolitionist? I never could have believed it! If the minister had told me in church, I would have said: It isn't so! But, of course, you must know." 
               "Oh, I am quite sure of it. Do wear pink ribands at Mrs. Armistead's party. Pink becomes you so much." 
               "Do you think so? I hope to see you there." 
               "Of course. And if you will try a quadrille with me, I shall be the happiest of mortals!" Hassel turned his eyes upon Mrs. Waddlekin's face, with passionate affection, and pressed both hands upon his stomach, as if he suffered from cramps. 
               "Perhaps," simpered the widow. "But this is terrible about Mr. Welland. He has been received into the bosom of our families!" And her own heaved angrily. 
               "Yes, he has been petted. He will doubtless be invited to this party." 
               "Not, if I can help it," cried Mrs. Waddlekins dlekins, with energy. "Shall the daughter of Washington's bosom friend sit at the same table with a traitor and an abolitionist? Never!" and she stuck her arm straight out, and made a statue of offended dignity of herself. 
               "How grand you look, when you are angry!" cried Hassel, folding his hands in admiration. "But you can not help it, my dear madam." 
               "And why not?" asked the statue, reluctantly taking down her arm. 
               "Because he is the guest of the Goldmans. If they are asked, he must be asked too." 
               "He will not be asked. This day shall I go to Mrs. Armistead, and explain the matter to her. The Goldmans will be invited, and the traitor ignored. I will see the invitation sent myself." 
               "How energetic you are, you noble daughters of the South," cried Hassel. "You are heroines compared to the timid women of the North! My dear Mrs. Waddlekins!" 
               "My dear Mr. Hassel!" and the widow squeezed his hand gently. 
               "We, men of the South," resumed Hassel, who grew frightened, as Mrs. Waddlekins grew tender, "we must not think of love and beauty now, we must darken the sweet pictures that fill our hearts, and prepare to defend our rights against the oppressor." 
                
               "Will you take a sandwich," said the widow, leading him to the house. 
               "How kind you are! I believe I will." 
               "And a glass of something?" 
               "Oh, how sweet it must be from your hand." 
               "Shall it be wine, or peach brandy." 
               "A little of the peach, if you please. But only if you will take some also." 
               "Dear me, I never take any thing." 
               "Only this time, to please me. It's your duty as hostess." 
               "I can never get it down my throat. Not so much!" 
               Hassel poured out a good wineglassfull for her. She declared she never could drink it. He pressed. Only one little drop. Just for company. Then she laughed, and said he was so pleasant, that she couldn't resist. Finally she took a sip. Then another; she declared that was all she ever could get down. But Hassel said, they had not drank any toasts as yet, and she must pledge him. That was the law of hospitality. So she pledged him. Then he gave: "Mrs. W--, the fairest of the fair!" and drank, turning his eyes up to the ceiling. Then she sipped again. And then they drank: "The glory of the South." And, at last, her glass was empty, and without circumlocution, she had another. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XV. 
               WHEN Hassel left Mrs. Waddlekins, he rode over to Tourtelotte's place, and gave him a synopsis of his conversation with the widow. 
               "Now," said Tourtelotte, "I shall be at hand, when the invitation is given. Probably they will refuse. But Antonia's manner of refusing may tell me much." 
               "You may be sure that this seedy German surveyor is after the wealthy Miss Goldman, and quite likely to succeed in his plans." 
               "Do you mean to say that she likes him?" 
               "Why not? He is handsome." 
               "That is no reason. Her mother will never allow it." 
               "Nor is that a reason, if she likes him." 
               "Bah! He talks German literature and romantic poetry to her, and it amuses." 
               "Perhaps he gives her illustrations of the love scenes." 
               "No. He could not so far forget himself, nor she. Still I feel uneasy; in truth, I am jealous." 
               "Why not drive him from the neighborhood?" 
               "We are at it, I believe. You at least." 
               "Yes. I have spread his fame as an abolitionist, until every one is turned against him. Still it will need something more to drive him away." 
                
               "You do not mean violence? No, that must not be!" 
               "Not exactly violence. A little tar and feathers." 
               "Never. I would defend him with my body." 
               "He will need all the defenders he can muster, if this election should go against us. An abolitionist will not be safe in Claiborne County, if the republicans carry it." 
               "He will at least have time to escape." 
               "Scarcely. Our men are organized, and on the election going wrong, they will rise at once." 
               "Well, the matter must soon be settled. And now I will station a nigger on the road, to inform me when Mrs. Armistead's carriage passes, so that I may be able to dash over to Pineland in time, and observe the reception." 
               "Depend on it, she will fight for him." 
               "I don't think so." 
               "You are a model of confidence." 
               "And you of suspicion." 
               It was not long before a little fellow, whose head was covered with several pounds of wooly hair, so that he looked like a sable mop, came dashing into the room, and announced the passage of Mrs. Armistead's carriage. 
               Tourtelotte mounted his horse, and arrived at Pineland very soon after the carriage. He entered the parlor at once. 
               Mrs. Goldman sat upon the sofa with a troubled look upon her countenance. Madame la Generale, who occupied a high arm-chair, was very red, and her eyes sparkled fiercely. Antonia stood behind her grand aunt's chair, pale, and with compressed lips. Fronting them, sat Mrs. Armistead, a lady of aristocratic features, with hair white as the driven snow, though she could not have been older than fortyfive. Mrs. Armistead was speaking in a soft, apologetic kind of voice: 
               "But my dear Madame Outon, this is the reason why I brought the invitation myself. I felt it necessary to explain to you personally this seeming breach of manners, which I am compelled to commit toward you. Political opinions run so high, that I would hazard the peace of my entertainment, were I to ask Mr. Welland." 
               "Truly?" inquired Madam la Generale, with cold hauteur. "I have had the fortune to attend at entertainments where half the monarchs of Europe were assembled, and where every political system and all extremes were represented. But I have never observed that well-bred people endangered the peace of a salon, no matter what their opinions." 
               "I do not doubt it, Madame Outon," responded Mrs. Armistead. "But you forget that our planters are people far more independent, and perhaps not quite as high bred as the monarchs of Europe." 
               "What do you say, mother?" asked Antonia. 
                
               "I really don't understand the affair," replied Mrs. Goldman, piteously. "My nerves trouble me so to-day, that I must leave every decision to your aunt." 
               Thus she extricated herself from this difficulty. The Armisteads were not only wealthy, but a truly aristocratic family, of great social position and influence. Mrs. Goldman had worshiped at their shrine, and saw now, with terror, a breach opened between her house and their's. So she determined not to commit herself, but keep her forces in reserve. 
               "You see the impossibility of accepting an invitation thus limited," said Antonia to Madame la Generale. "Do you not, dear aunt?" 
               "Decidedly. Accept our regrets, Mrs. Armistead. Our guest, whatever his political opinions may be, is our guest. If the family visit any entertainment, he accompanies us. If we accept any invitation, it must include him." And the old lady opened her fan, as a peacock might unfold his tail, and waved it in the manner of the Empress Maria Louisa. 
               "But consider my dear Madame Outon. I owe some regard to the excitement of minds just now!" 
               "I can not advise you as to your duties, madam. But I know that we shall, with regret, miss a pleasant evening at your house," said the old lady, with a politeness somewhat acidulous. 
               "But they would surely quarrel. I am sincerely grieved that you will not attempt to comprehend my position." 
               "You have, no doubt, acted as beseems a lady of Mrs. Armistead's breeding. You possess my regard too entirely, for me to review your motives in any case." 
               Mrs. Armistead was silent for a few moments. Then she resumed, with a graceful smile: 
               "Will you pardon my want of tact, and accept my invitation for all your family, including Mr. Welland, or any other guest you may please to bring? I shall be happy to see you all, and grateful for the honor." 
               At this, Mrs. Goldman, ignoring nerves and all, hastened to reply: 
               "With great pleasure, Mrs. Armistead. I am sure, my aunt can find no further objection." 
               Madame la Generale looked but half satisfied, and said nothing. So Mrs. Armistead resumed: 
               "Accept my apologies Madame Outon, and remember, that whatever happens, I am irresponsible. If uncongenial minds are forced together, no one can foretell the result." And she prepared to take her leave. 
               Madame la Generale accepted the invitation, and with Mrs. Goldman accompanied their visitor to the door. 
               Tourtelotte had been sitting in a corner all this time, seemingly engaged in looking over a book of engravings. But he had been deeply attentive, notwithstanding. He had seen, morever, what was not observed by the rest, that Antonia was so agitated during this conversation, that she pulled to pieces an elegant little feather fan she happened to hold in her hand, without seeming to be aware of what she was doing. As the ladies left the parlor, she sat down, and oblivious of Tourtelotte's presence, heaved a deep sigh. He came softly, and stood behind her. He observed through the window, that when Mrs. Armistead had gone, Mrs. Goldman's carriage drove up, and that lady and her aunt retired to dress for their drive. After a few minutes they re-appeared, and were driven off by the sable coachman. Still he spake not a word, but stood silently behind Antonia, who gazed into her lap buried in thought, and entirely unconscious of his presence. 
               It was very quiet in that large, cool room. The sun made fanciful figures of light and shade, and the wind playing with the boughs, sent the shadows spinning over the green lawn. There was a soothing rustle in the leafy elm trees, and the hum of a sunny day pervaded the air. 
               At last Tourtelotte heaved a sigh, and said: 
               "Poor fan!" 
               Antonia started and rose. She rallied in a moment, and said with an assumption of playfulness: 
               "Mr. Tourtelotte, how could you manage to keep so quiet? You deserve to be elected god of silence." 
               But Tourtelotte gathered up the fragments of the fan, and the scattered feathers, and asked, reproachfully: 
               "At whose shrine was this sacrificed? Not to the god of silence?" 
               Antonia blushed violently. Still she endeavored to keep up the playful tone she had assumed, and replied: 
               "No. Gods are not propitiated by having their own gifts rent to pieces before them. Don't you remember, you gave me this fan?" 
               "Yes. Nor are men propitiated by such a proceeding." 
               "Don't be severe, Mr. Tourtelotte. I am very sorry, for I prized this fan highly, but still more sorry, if I have offended you. When I am agitated, I can not keep my fingers quiet. I am a real bird of prey then, and always tear what is nearest to me." 
               "I know it, and you have torn my heart more than once." 
               "I think I never held that article in my hands," replied Antonia, turning somewhat pale. "I am sure that it would be in bad keeping if confided to me." 
               "Oh, if you would accept it!" cried Tourtelotte, seizing her hand, his dark eyes flashing with passion. 
               "Better retain it for the present, sir," said Antonia, withdrawing her hand, and forcing herself to smile. "I would not know what to do with it. Besides you will need it, if the South goes to war. 
               "Take it, and rend it as you have this fan! But only take it." 
               "I like you too much Mr. Tourtelotte-" 
               "And love me too little! Oh, I knew it!" 
               Antonia saw that he was highly excited. So she rose, and gently holding out her hand to him, said in those deep, rich tones that thrilled every heart: 
               "Frank Tourtelotte, don't make yourself miserable by giving way to feelings, which had better be repressed. I am your friend, be content." 
               "Content with the perfume, while another plucks the rose? Content with your friendship, while another enjoys your love? Antonia, this is impossible!" 
               "Another? Sir! you are insulting!" 
               "Oh, jealousy has sharp eyes! But I will make the South too hot to hold him. I will be rid of him before long. And if the entire devotion of a true heart can not move you, circumstances may arise, which will make Frank Tourtelotte's arm and protection necessary to you." 
               "I can not listen to such language." 
               "Miss Goldman, we will forget every thing that has transpired between us this morning. Let events take their course, and we may understand each other better at some future time." 
               "I hope so," replied Antonia, smiling sadly. "Why have you visited us so seldom dom of late, Mr. Tourtelotte? Is it true that politics claim you to such an extent, that every other occupation is crowded out of your thoughts?" 
               "It is true. Every occupation is crowded out, but one." 
               "And that is?" 
               "Thinking of you." 
               "I am very grateful, though I did not imagine myself to be a subject requiring much thought." 
               "Still, all my thoughts are devoted to you." 
               "Don't let us drift into sentimentalities again, I pray. Have you heard the new song 'Dixie'?" 
               "No; will you favor me?" 
               "With pleasure. When aunt is at home, I dare not venture on a song like this." 
               She sat down at the piano, and Tourtelotte gathered the fragments of the fan, and pressed them violently against his beating heart. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               ABOUT four days after the Presidential election, Mrs. Armistead's party came off. It was a beautiful November evening, and the full moon deluged the landscape with soft, silver light. The leaves had turned, but very few of the trees had shed their foliage. Here and there stood a maple, with the deep, burning red upon its branches, like a blood spot on the orange-brown mantle of the hills; a grape myrtle shook out its boughs of crimson and gold, like a flame divided in many tongues. The air had that mellow autumn fragrance which simulates the flavor of a ripe apple, and the cool wind saturated with dew, made one shiver with a sensation half pleasant and half annoying. 
               The guests had assembled in great numbers. The parlors, boudoir, sitting-room, library, music-room, in fact the whole house had been thrown open, and was filled with groups of gaily-attired persons. Flowers and lights met the eye at every turn. In windows and corners, and from all prominent points, hung elegant baskets of gilded wire, full of bright red verbenas, bordered with snowy asters. Vases, crowned with japonicas, dazzling in their transparent purity, were relieved by sprigs of scarlet geranium and orange blossoms. Branches of ivy wound around the various statuettes, and a magnificent bust of the Venus di Milo was draped in a coil of passion flower, with its voluptuous purple buds overhanging that face of undying beauty. 
               Every table and stand was laden with gorgeous vessels to hold flowers, and the fragrance of the roses, the odor of the heliotropes, sweet allysum and mignonette, combined with the heavy perfume of hyacynths, cape jessamines and azaleas, filled the house. Lamps were strewn about in magnificent profusion, and a covered walk bordered with venetian lanterns of every color, led into a large tent that had been erected in the garden for the dancers. 
               The parlors were very elegant. Rosewood furniture covered with white silk damask, and a carpet of white velvet, strewn with moss roses. The pictures, and mirrors, and curtains, gave life to this colorless splendor. In a corner stood Mrs. Armistead, supported by her husband and daughter, receiving the guests. They had an engaging word for all. As people left this group, they strolled whither their inclinations carried them. Some of the older ladies and gentlemen made at once for the library, where card tables were set out. The very young assembled in the music-room, and had chats, and laughter, with now and then a song, to give countenance to the conversation. The matrons, and mature young ladies gathered in groups in the parlors, to greet and perhaps criticise new arrivals. The gentlemen were everywhere, especially in the bachelor's den, a small apartment, of whose existence the ladies were supposed to be ignorant, and in which wines, and liquors, and iced rum punch were served by two mulatto boys. The Goldmans arrived late. Mrs. Armistead advanced two steps, and greeted them with especial politeness. To Welland she was markedly kind. 
               Mrs. Goldman in purple more-antique; Madame la Generale in black velvet, Brussels lace and diamonds; Antonia in the most vivid apple green, with bunches of grass and silver sprigs in her hair; these were their dresses. Immediately after having bowed to their hostess, Welland took Antonia to the music-room, while the others remained in the parlor. There was a hush on their appearance, and then conversation only recovered after some spasmodic efforts. Welland at once felt that intuitive chill, which attacks one when conscious of being out of place, or not welcome. The ladies of his acquaintance, who addressed Antonia or gathered around her, bowed to him with that politeness which keeps one at a distance. The gentlemen merely acknowledged his salutations, or made frigid remarks in reply to his observations. With the self-possession of good manners, the young man kept countenance notwithstanding all this, though occasionally his dark eyes flashed with anger. 
               From the tent in the garden, arose the strains of music. All began to engage ladies. Hassel, with Mrs. Waddlekins on his arm, led the way. Mrs. Waddlekins was attired in the black satin that would only hook on top, and draped in the shawl that covered the defects of this garment. As that lady swept by Welland, she turned her head away, and by a motion of her hand, prevented the black satin from coming in contact with him. This was proceeding to an extremity that the young ladies were not prepared to approve of, and so they flushed, and one said: 
               "Mr. Welland, I hope you are not in love with Mrs. Waddlekins. If so, your rival seems to be in the ascendant." 
               "Yes," replied Welland, "and contrary to the proverb, he seems to have equal fortune with ladies and in cards." 
               A laugh rewarded this sally, and soon all were dancing in the large tent, with waiters diving about, handing lemonades and ices. 
               "Miss Goldman, will you accord me permission to withdraw?" asked Welland, as soon as he had an opportunity of addressing her alone. "I do not seem to be welcome." 
               "It is in consequence of political excitement," replied Antonia, "but stay here, please; stay and face it, Mr. Welland. Will you do so, for my sake?" 
               "I will do whatever you wish." 
               Tourtelotte approached, and with an apology to Welland, carried Antonia off for a waltz. Being left alone, the young German walked into the house, and entered the parlor. His appearance was the signal for a knot of gentlemen to gather around him. 
               "Mr. Welland," said one of them, an English lawyer, "you are a gentleman of deep study. Have you ever in your historical researches discovered traces of a nation, that was continually occupied with attempting to free the slaves of others, while it never succeeded in liberating itself from slavery? It was a nation of Teutonic origin, I think." 
                
               "The very same that liberated the Britons from their invaders, centuries ago," retorted Welland. 
               "They are truly unselfish," said another. "They claim the negro as a brother, and we help to equalize these brethren in spirit, by tarring the one a little that he may resemble his brother also in appearance." 
               "That is, no doubt, a convincing argument," returned Welland. "And it should be, since it is the only one." 
               "Oh no, we have others. There are beautiful horsewhips manufactured in the South." 
               "And in the North, sir, they make fine revolvers." 
               Mr. Armistead broke into the circle, followed by a servant with a tray of refreshments. 
               "Gentlemen, will you not take ices?" he asked. "Mr. Welland, I have a message for you. Miss Armistead is about to sing something, and requests you to accompany her on the piano." 
               Welland bowed, and crossing to the other side, offered the young lady his arm to lead her to the music-room. 
               By the time Miss Armistead had finished that song, and tried another, a good number of young people had returned to the room. There was a lull in dancing. The musicians declared that they must rest a little. 
               So when she left the side of the piano, Miss Armistead requested Welland to give them a song, some German or Tyrolean ballad. He bowed, and striking some rich accords, began that beautiful Alpine song: "The May breezes." With touching pathos, he repeated the sad chant: 
                      
                        "When Spring time returneth, 
                        The flowers bloom once more; 
                        But love in a life-time 
                        Blooms once, and 'tis o'er." 
                     
                  
                
               Then Miss Goldman sang an aria from some opera, and others followed. Presently a young man turned to Welland, and said: 
               "How queer people are! Now it is incomprehensible to me how any one of noble feelings and good education, can not see at once that our negroes are best situated as at present, and that they would perish of want if left to themselves." 
               "Who would perish of want?" inquired Welland. "The masters?" 
               "The negroes, sir!" repeated the young man, fiercely. 
               "I have little doubt of it," replied Welland. "They have not been taught to act for themselves. I don't know how this condition is ever to be amended, but I have given little thought to the subject." 
               "If you have given little thought to it, why do you act as you do, sir? Why do you not leave the South in the proper enjoyment of their property, sir?" 
               "My dear young man," replied Welland, smiling, "has the South delegated you to put this question to me? I am not aware of having disturbed it in the enjoyment of its property." 
               "Excuse me," Returned the other, a little confused, "but are you not,-I beg your pardon, for applying such a term to you-don't feel insulted if it isn't true-are you not an-an abolitionist?" 
               "And if I were? Don't you believe that abolitionists go to heaven sometimes?" 
               "No sir," replied the Rev. Mr. Broadcloth, who had heard this question. "Abolitionists do not go to heaven, because they act contrary to the commands of the bible, which orders slavery, and which has cursed the race of Ham, and which subordinates the heathen to the believer. We are instruments of God's vengeance in enslaving the African race, sir." 
               Mr. Armistead came up, and seized the Rev. Mr. Broadcloth's arm. 
               "Will you say grade, my dear sir? We are about to proceed to table." 
               And every gentleman offered his arm to a lady, and followed Mr. and Mrs. Armistead to the dining-room, where the ladies took seats, and the gentlemen waited on them. Soon foaming champagne was handed about in those large goblets, light as a feather, that correspond so well with the character of the wine, and seem bubbles themselves, ready to burst or melt at a touch. Conversation grew sprightly beyond description, and the Armisteads, with infinite art, knew how to put in a word here, join in a laugh there, and start subjects that set people talking or laughing. Their servants were perfection. They anticipated the wants of the guests, and while they prevented any one from being at trouble to help his partner, they were not obtrusive enough to rob the gentlemen of the gallant privilege of supplying the ladies. There was animation in every countenance, and a smile on every lip. 
               Antonia and Welland were in the recess of a window, chatting and laughing in great good humor. While they were eating heartily, the lady exerted herself to the utmost to drive away the clouds which previous conversations had conjured up on his brow. She succeeded admirably. Welland had soon forgotten the existence of everybody else, and gazed into those sea-blue eyes with the devoted intensity of an Arabian astrologer, seeking to read his fate in the stars of heaven. They were so near to each other, that the breeze entering at the window, once or twice blew one of her sunny curls across his face, and made him shiver at the contact, with an intensity of delight that he had never before experienced. Caution, reason, resolutions, all melted away as snow, before the fascination of the moment. He was completely bewitched, and had ceased to be master of his emotions. 
               Suddenly a hand was thrust through the open window, and seized him by the arm. He turned. It was Sellington Sharp, who stood upon the verandah. He whispered: 
                
               "Come out at once. Great danger threatens you, so help me God! Come out, and away with me." 
               "But," returned Welland, "I can not understand-" 
               A great noise arose in the hall. Every one turned an expectant face to the door. Heavy steps approached, and a man, roughly clad, and covered with dust, entered. At his appearance, Mr. Armistead sprang forward, and cried in a voice choked with excitement: 
               "Have you news? What is the result?" 
               "Abraham Lincoln has been elected," replied the man. 
               A deadly silence ensued, followed by a cry of execration. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               "STEP out immediately," whispered Sellington Sharp. "You will not be able to pass by the door, on account of the crowd. Step out of this window." 
               The window was of French fashion, and reached down to within a few inches of the floor. Sharp, who had seized Welland's arm, drew him out of the room with frantic energy, while Antonia, vaguely suspecting the danger, hastened his retreat by urgent entreaties. 
               "Well, what do you want?" inquired Welland, reluctantly following his guide, who kept hold of his arm, and walked him through the garden. 
                
               "I will tell you in good time, Mr. Welland," replied Sharp, opening a door at the further end of the garden, and passing out with his captive. 
               A buggy was in waiting. 
               "But my hat, Mr. Sharp," said the young man, "let me return for it." 
               "Get in immediately. I am thinking more of your head, than of your hat." 
               They both got in, and the negro who drove, whipped up the horse in fine style. It went rapidly over the smooth, sandy roads toward Pineland. Welland could not avoid noticing that they made use of by-roads, and rather kept aloof from the highway. As Mr. Sharp was silent on the subject of this extraordinary abduction, Welland thought it better not to question him, but await the development with patience. 
               The moon half veiled, gave a timid light, a light that seemed to pass through the medium of ground glass. There were milky vapors in the atmosphere. On both sides of the road the pine woods rose, full of mystic silence and awful shadows. The continued crunching of the sand as the wheels passed over it, was the only sound they heard, beside the croaking of the bull frogs in their swampy meres. 
               At last they reached Pineland. They approached it from the rear, and dismounted near a door that led to Sharp's apartments. 
               "Ned," said the manager, "put the horse into the stable, and go to bed. Don't mention that you've been away." 
               The intelligent negro nodded, and Sharp now led the way to the rooms. After entering them, he locked the door and said: 
               "Now, Mr. Welland, make yourself comfortable, for you must remain here all night. I can trust to Ned's discretion, but beside him none of the servants must know of your presence." 
               "My dear Mr. Sharp, all this looks very mysterious. May I ask, first of all, why you have carried me away bareheaded from Mrs. Armistead's house, without even giving me time to take leave of my hostess? And then, may I inquire what those hints of danger import, which you have thrown out to me? You are too grave a man to perpetrate a practical joke, but I puzzle my brains in vain to discover the cause of your proceeding." 
               "It is no joke. Would it were!" 
               "What can you mean? We are not in France or Austria, where a secret order may doom a man to imprisonment for many years, nor in Italy where bravos assassinate one unawares." 
               "We are in worse than either of these countries. Much worse. Much worse!" And Mr. Sharp cast a troubled look into his millstone, and seemed to derive no gratification therefrom. 
               "Speak plain, if you please." 
               "We are in a country where the men acquire their civilization, as we eat soup, in large doses. All the ferocity of the savage is left, and comes to the surface when they are stirred up, just as the forced meat-balls will float on top, when I stir my soup." 
               "But what have I to do with their civilization?" 
               "Enough. Have you never heard of lynch law?" 
               "Yes, often. It is the virtuous expedient of the populace when a crime is committed, that outrages humanity, and which the laws can not reach, or its executives will not punish." 
               Sharp looked at him with a pityingsmile. "It may be so defined in your university books, but it's a different thing here. Do you know what it is here? Do you know? Here it is a mob of a thousand or more people crazy with liquor and excitement. Here it is a crowd of intoxicated beasts, of raving wolves, of mad bulls. Here it is a concourse of maniacs that have gotten hold of one poor human being and are determined to torture him with a coat of seething pitch and a ride on a rail; and if the stones thrown and the pistols discharged do not make an end of him, they duck him in a horse-pond until it is discovered that he is a corpse. That is lynch law in Tennessee." 
               "Do these things actually happen?" 
               "Do they happen? Look at him," cried Sharp, appealing to the ceiling, "look at him sitting there and asking: do these things actually happen? Mr. Welland," he cried with a pounce at him, "you would have experienced what lynch law was, had I not gone for you to the Armisteads. Mr. Welland, the town is crazy over the election of Abraham Lincoln, and they were going to lie in wait for you, and lynch you as an abolitionist spy." 
               "But I am not an abolitionist. I actually do not belong to any political party." 
               "Much good this assertion would have done you. You might as well have remonstrated with a mad dog that had you by the throat." 
               "I can scarce believe in the reality of this danger, and besides it would not have been easy to use force with me," said Welland, shaking his muscular arm. 
               "Are you crazy?" cried Sharp, "or can you slay thousands like Samson?" 
               "Neither the one nor the other. But I am a man who knows how to defend himself." 
               "I have no patience with you. If you are absolutely mad, and want to fight somebody, I will have my servant Ned called, and you can pound him as long as you like." 
               "Forgive me," said Welland, "but I can not realize my danger as yet." 
               "I should think you could not. Now you have gotten me into an excitement, and spoiled my digestion." 
               "I hope not. Let us entirely lay aside the question of my danger, and talk of a more pleasant subject." 
                
               "Ah, true! Your queer ideas have driven all thoughts of propriety from my mind. Remember, you will stay here with me, unbeknown to any body in the house. That is necessary for the safety of the family." 
               "If my presence endangers any one, please let me go at once." 
               "Mr. Welland," screamed Sharp, "if you are not entirely crazed, don't provoke me any further. But," he continued, in a milder voice, "I am forgetting my duties as host. Mr. Welland," and he laid his hand confidentially on the young man's shoulder, "you must feel chilled and tired. You shall taste my Italian wines, and a bit of Boeuf a la mode of my own cuisine, before you retire." 
               In vain were all protestations to the contrary. In a few minutes the little stove, which stood in a corner of the room, blazed with a merry fire. Mr. Sharp put a white apron on, rolled up his sleeves, and opened a large cupboard. Thence he procured a saucepan and some dishes. Presently he disappeared, and returned with a piece of steak, folded in a white napkin. Now the manager began operations in earnest. His face glowed with satisfaction, as he explained to Welland the various stages of the process he was subjecting the meat to. 
               "First of all my dear sir," he said, "I put a lump of goose grease into the pan. This is preferable to any other fat." 
               "Now," he continued, with the tears running down his cheeks, "I slice these small onions, and put them into the fat. The cover must come on, because the onions are to be souffle to retain their full flavor. They insisted on that in the 48th of the line." 
               "And now," he said, "the onions being browned, I add claret, and stir the mess. They prefer Rhine wine or Moselle in Strasburg, but claret is more correct." 
               "These are Champignons, mushrooms they call them here," he continued, showing Welland the small pyramidal bodies. "I slice them, and put them with the rest, just one minute before I add a, few bits of carrot. Some people also suggest potato, but that is vulgar." 
               "Now comes the seasoning. Then more claret, and one spoonful of Madeira. Look at this meat!" he cried. "It is larded as they call it. Perforated with little holes, and bits of goose fat forced in! A bit of garlic rubbed over it! A thought of red pepper! And into the pan it goes! On with the cover, and stew for ten minutes. This was the favorite dish of His Majesty, the King of the French." 
               "Louis Phillipe?" asked Welland. 
               "Yes, and he was a connoisseur. I knew his body cook." 
               "Now," he continued, "I will set the table," and he proceeded to do so with great neatness. By the time he had finished, the meat was ready, and being turned out upon a dish that had been warming, it was placed upon the table. 
               "Before we eat," said Sharp, "let us drink this;" and he poured from a large bottle a deep yellow wine into two very small glasses. 
               Welland drank. 
               "This is Vermouth," he said, recognizing that aromatic wine of Pyrmont, which, resembling Abscynthe in bitterness of taste, has come into general use as an appetizer. 
               "Aye," replied Sharp, "and of the best. But it is impolite to let the meat wait. Permit me to help you. A king of France might eat of this on his wedding day." 
               Welland tasted it. It was delicious. The vapors that arose from the dish, might have tempted a god to desert his nectar. There was an aroma of culinary refinement, and a perfection of taste in it, that justified Sharp's countenance beaming with triumph. He was glorified, and while his eyes watched every emotion of pleasure on Welland's face, with increasing satisfaction, he himself allowed, so to say, the morsels to melt on his tongue, and swallowed them at last, with a sigh of pleasure. No Lucullus ever enjoyed a meal to such an extent. 
               Welland wished to speak once or twice. But Sharp lifted his hand in a frightened manner. "Don't disturb me," he Whispered. "Don't speak. Give your mind to the eating. This boeuf must be eaten with all attention, lest you lose some of the flavor." 
               So they feasted in silence. Presently Sharp lifted two bottles from under the table. 
               "Burgundy or Capri Rosso?" he inquired. 
               "Capri," replied Welland, extending his glass. The wine was old, and sparkled in ruby splendor in the cut goblet. It was magnificent. Rich, warm, dry almost to crispness, and with a great deal of body. 
               "Glorious," cried the young man; "it is a long-" 
               "Don't speak," interrupted Sharp. "Put all your mind on your palate. It is eighteen years old." 
               They finished the bottle. Sharp arose and removed the dishes. He placed roasted chestnuts and Italian cheese upon the table. Then procured new glasses, and another bottle of wine. 
               "What excellent chestnuts," remarked Welland. 
               "I boil them, and soak them in claret before roasting," replied Sharp. "Now taste this wine." As he opened the bottle and filled the glasses, the room was pervaded with a perfume as of flowers. The wine was of a bright, golden hue, and fragrant beyond description. 
               "This is the nectar of the gods," cried Welland. 
               "Only Amarena di Siracusa. The best dessert wine in the world." 
                
               It was divine. It was the sunshine of Italian skies; it was the fragrance of orange gardens, the mellowness of overripe figs, the fire of a southern climate, and the sweetness of Sicilian summers, liquified and imprisoned in a bottle. There is no wine in the world at once so soft and so fiery, so sweet and so strong, as this magnificent Amarena. 
               While they were still sipping it, a noise like the growl of the sea, was heard approaching the house. As it neared, it proved to be the cry of a great multitude. Both arose from their chairs. Sharp was pale as death. 
               "You see," said Welland, calmly, "your efforts were in vain." 
               "Great heaven," cried Sharp, "it is the mob!" 
               "I will go and meet them. This house shall not be endangered by my presence." 
               "For God's sake, stay," cried Sharp. "You endanger it by showing that you were hidden here. Promise me to stay, and I swear to you, I will send you forth in time to prevent any mischief to this mansion." 
               "But how will you do it?" 
               "Let me manage. I can do more than prepare boeuf a la mode." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               THE north-eastern part of Tennessee resembles North Carolina in many respects. In none more than in the possession of a number of so-called "poor whites."-These are miserable beings, raised in the swamps and pine woods on corn and bacon, and hereditarily endowed with scrofula and diseases of the liver, while intermittent and remittent fevers are their semi-annual guests. They cultivate a small patch of ground in a poor, lazy way, and keep a few half starved hogs. Their huts are filthy, and their gardens choked up with weeds. They many quite young, and very many of their children are yellow and dropsical. Their intelligence is at minimum. 
               The chief sources of dependence of these poor whites, are the large plantations. They trade in a small way with the negro servants for the articles that they have raised, or filched from the produce of the plantation. They eat the crumbs that fall from the planter's table. They accept castoff things, and are indifferent to the extent of their misery, if not compelled to work. 
               To enumerate all their sources of revenue, we must not forget that they manufacture slats from the pine tree, win a little turpentine from the same, burn charcoal, and gather kindling wood from the decaying trunks, and trade in blackberries. 
               This part of the population is ever ready to do a planter's bidding. They look up to him as vassals to their feudal lord. They follow his lead, especially at the polls, and their vote goes as far as that of any other man. Moreover, they are handy with the rifle and bowie knife, and therefore, not to be despised in actual difficulties. 
               It was chiefly of these poor whites the mob was composed, which now approached the house at Pineland. Sharp and Welland had both entered one of the front rooms, and saw them come near. They also saw, behind the main crowd, several figures on horseback, which seemed to direct the movements of the rest. At a little distance from the house a halt was made, and a consultation held. Then four or five detached themselves from the main body, and approached the front door. Sharp hastened down-stairs to receive them, while Welland remained on the upper landing to overhear, if possible, their conversation. 
               On being admitted, the spokesman of the five, who was a tall, gaunt figure, in a broad-brimmed hat and dirty homespun, inquired, politely enough, for Mr. Goldman. 
               "He is from home," replied Sharp. "He and his family are at Mr. Armistead's house." 
               "Where is the young man that has been staying here for the past week?" was the next question. 
               "Whom do you mean? Mr. Welland?" 
                
               "Aye, that's his name, I believe," replied the other, with a laugh. "Where is he?" 
               "He has gone with the family to Mr. Armistead's." 
               "But he isn't there any more." 
               "Then I don't know where he is. I expect him to return with Mr. Goldman. They must be here soon." 
               "Well, we'll wait, and inspect the house meanwhile." 
               "In a moment. Permit me to order candles, and something to drink for you." 
               Sharp left the room, and rushed upstairs. In a minute, he had ascertained that guards surrounded the house. So he seized Welland, and dragged him back into his own room, pushed him into the closet where his dishes were kept, and crowded him behind a huge dresser. 
               "Remain quiet for our sake and your own!" he whispered, and ran down again, rousing his servant by the way, and ordering lights. 
               "Now, gentlemen," he said, "if you will come into my own room, and taste some superior brandy I have there, your people can search the house, as you seem to consider that necessary." 
               "Of course we do," replied the leader, and sent one of his followers for some more assistance. "Nothing shall be touched. All we want is the young abolitionist." 
               "Is he an abolitionist?" asked Sharp, leading the way to his apartment. 
               "Didn't you know it?" asked the leader. "He is a regular spy, sent here to carry off niggers." 
               "You astonish me. How do you like this brandy?" 
               "It's first rate. Makes one feel right pert," drawled out one of the five. 
               "Tastes after more," decided the leader. 
               So the glasses were re-filled. 
               There they sat on chairs and lounges with the little table, at which Welland and Sharp had supped, in their midst, and the half-open closet where the former was concealed, not ten feet from any one of them. Others searched the house, without result, while these drank Sharp's excellent brandy. 
               Suddenly they heard the sound of wheels approaching the house, followed by a loud noise at the front door. 
               They listened for a moment, and then descended. The family had arrived, accompanied by Tourtelotte. The carriage halted at a little distance from the mansion, while Tourtelotte, who was on horseback, dashed up to the door and inquired in a voice of thunder: 
               "What does all this mean? What do you want here?" 
               The men were silent, but one of the figures on horseback approached, and seized Tourtelotte's arm. 
               "Don't interrupt them," he said, "they are looking for the abolitionist spy, Welland." 
               "Hazelton!" cried Tourtelotte. "And you are leading them? Now, by the eternal God, call these fellows off, or you are a dead man!" He had drawn a pistol from his holsters, and brought its muzzle in contact with Hassel's forehead. 
               The gambler shrank back. 
               "It's none of my concern," he said. "I am not their commander, nor have I set them on." 
               "You are my surety that they shall leave, at any rate," cried Tourtelotte, shaking him until he slid from the saddle to the ground. And then, turning to those that had been in the house, and whom the noise had called to the door, he cried: 
               "Get out of this house, ye swamp hounds, that prowl about at night! How dare you enter a gentleman's house without his leave?" 
               "We are looking for an abolitionist here, Mr. Tourtelotte," said the tall, gaunt leader. 
               "Do you suppose he would sit down and wait for you, stupids? He might be half way to Kentucky by this time." 
               "We've searched the house, and can't find him, so we might as well go," replied the other, turning a questioning glance upon his companions. 
               "The old gentleman's liquor is first rate. Let's get some more," suggested one. 
               "I'll season your liquor with powder and lead, my boy," cried Tourtelotte. "Off with you, men, and if you want to find abolitionists, look for them on the way to Cumberland Pass." 
               The crowd, however, were unwilling to depart without a "treat." They murmured, and finally demanded it. So Sharp, who now ventured out, made some negroes bring forth a keg of spirits and tin cups, and began to supply the mob with drink. Tourtelotte had returned to the carriage, and quieted the ladies. Madame la Generale was indignant beyond expression, and talked of paying a visit to the French minister at Washington, and demanding satisfaction from the United States for this outrage, committed on a French subject. Antonia was pale and silent, while Mrs. Goldman grew profuse in her expressions of gratitude to the young Creole. 
               Finally, the mob broke up, and the ladies left the carriage, and entered the house. As soon as they were fairly in the parlor, Mrs. Goldman fainted away comfortably upon a sofa. Salts and cold water being brought into requisition, she gave signs of returning life, and finally was brought to entirely, with a great deal of trouble. Madame la Generale had not gotten over her rage, but still show red French denunciations upon the sauvages, who dared to invade the privacy of a gentleman's mansion. Antonia, who was painfully embarrassed by the course of events, hastened to make an end of the present scene, by dismissing Tourtelotte. 
               "Sir," she said to him, "you have proved yourself a 'preux chevalier' this night. Believe me, I shall not forget your chivalresque interference in our behalf. Let me entreat your return to-morrow morning, for we need the advice of our friends in this unfortunate affair." 
               She gave her hand to him, and in bowing, her curls, heavy and damp, touched his fingers. Quick as lightning, he lifted that slender soft hand, and brushed it with his lips. A sea of blushes deluged the young lady's face and neck, succeeded by a sad, pale color, and a glance of her sea-blue eyes, serious and pityful. 
               So Tourtelotte passed out, and mounted his horse. Giving him the spurs, the noble animal bounded away swift as the wind. But presently the rider changed his mind, and drew the check rein with such violence, that the horse was forced back on his haunches, and made a desperate demi volte, in order to keep on his feet. Tourtelotte turned, and shook his fist at the house. 
               "Sent away by that witch of a girl, while he is probably concealed in the garret! Well, 'tis the last time. The events of this evening have given me claims on her. Let her see to it, that she satisfy them! A time is coming, when the strong arm of a man will be required to shield the wealth of fathers, and the honor of daughters. Antonia, I claim thee as mine own from this night! Thy sea-blue eyes and sunny curls, thy wealth and intelligence, all must be mine! Thou art my angel-God grant that I may not be thy devil!" 
               He rode slowly on. 
               "As for him," he said, "I must make an end of him. He will attempt to go North by the Pass, to-morrow or the day after. I will tell Hazelton, and lend him my bloodhound." 
               He lifted up his eyes, and behold, the morning was breaking. While the expiring moon fluttered like a wan shadow on the sky, the hills in deep violet stood out from the rose-tinted east behind them. The early birds began to chirp, and the freshness of a new day rose on the atmosphere. 
               "God help me," he said, "I will not be a scoundrel. Whether he stays or goes, I will hit him openly and in front. But I will not set Hazelton on him, for he is worse than a bloodhound." 
               And he galloped home, and sought his couch. 
               At the window of her room stood Antonia, and gazed after the retreating figure. When he had disappeared behind the trees that bordered the road, she extinguished her lamp, drew back the curtains that swept the ground, and raised the sash. The fresh morning air came in damp with dew, those tears that drop from the starry eyes of night. The gray vapors rose from the hills in large and fanciful shapes. The east was bright with every shade of red, and the sky above had the milky transparency rency of pale, blue glass. The great golden beams of the sun began to flash through the red glow, and the day had fairly broken. 
               The delicate girl at that window gazed out upon the sky and the trees, but saw nothing. Her sea-blue eyes had a vacant and abstracted look. Her sweet face was somewhat wan. And the hair, with its ornaments of green grass and silver sprigs, hung listlessly upon her shoulders. 
               "I am afraid of him whenever he talks so," she whispered to herself. "I really don't know what to do." 
               There was a tap at her door, and on permission a bright mulatto girl entered, who immediately exclaimed: 
               "Missie Tony, you'll catch your death of cold. Let me shut that window. Has your lamp gone out?" and she busied herself re-lighting it. 
               "Undress me," said Antonia, wearily sitting down upon a stool. 
               "Yes Missie," and she began her task. "I've got something to tell you." 
               "What is it." 
               "Master Sharp wants me to ask you when you can come to his room to-morrow, before evening." 
               "What for?" 
               "Don't know. He wouldn't tell me." 
               "I'll see him in the afternoon, when mother takes her drive." 
               As she gave this reply, was there a brighter blush on her cheek? 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               IN the afternoon of the following day, Antonia entered Sharp's room. The old man received her, smiling slyly. 
               "Mr. Welland is in the house," he said. 
               "I supposed so," replied Antonia. "When will he leave?" 
               "To-night, in case you consent to see him." 
               "And if I refuse?" 
               "He will remain in the neighborhood." 
               "That is certain death. Why does he insist on seeing me?" she asked, with the most innocent face in the world. 
               "I don't know," replied Sharp, winking at his millstone. "He has been talking to me all day of that hillside at the eastern end of the estate. He says it contains large quantities of iron, and needs only to be worked to realize a colossal fortune. Perhaps he wants to discuss the subject with you." 
               Antonia blushed and smiled. 
               "Is it truly so about that red streaked hillside?" she asked. 
               "I am not sure," replied Sharp. "I told him that our Tennessee mining authorities had found the cost of digging out the iron of the Alleghanies to exceed the profits, especially in these parts." 
               "And he?" 
               "Merely laughed, and said he had invented a new way, by which iron could be won from the combination in which it is found here, with less than half the expense of other methods. He explained it to me, but I couldn't follow him." 
               "Don't you think his ideas are correct?" 
               "Yes, yes. He is very smart, and knows a great deal. I believe he is correct. But if I had a hundred thousand dollars in bank, I wouldn't invest them in this enterprise." 
               "I hope he will reach the North safely." 
               "You will see him then?" 
               "Yes. As he wants to see me, I suppose I must." 
               "Will you see him here?" 
               "No. In the garden at sundown." 
               "Impossible. I couldn't allow that. It is not safe for him, or quite proper for you." 
               "Perhaps you are right. Wait a moment. I will see him here." 
               "Now?" 
               "Now." 
               Sellington Sharp left the room, and returned presently with Welland. 
               "Miss Goldman," said the latter, "forgive me for troubling you. But I couldn't leave this State without seeing you, especially as I have no speedy return in view." 
               "I appreciate your motives," replied Antonia. "You wished to convey through me your farewell messages to my parents and aunt." 
               Sellington Sharp listened with a satirical smile to this exchange of commonplaces, and then said: 
                
               "Pray, excuse me. I have business that requires my presence," and left them alone. 
               They both grew very embarrassed. 
               "Miss Goldman," said Welland, and then stopped. Antonia recovered her composure first. She rose and gave him her hand. 
               "Dear friend," she said, letting the full gaze of her true sea-blue eyes rest upon his face, "dear friend, must we then part? How many hours do I owe you, and how sadly shall I miss the companion by whose side I have so often wandered through the pleasant fields of literature! Let me hope that quieter times will induce you to return hither, where we all, father, mother, aunt and Mr. Sharp, have grown to look upon you as a dear friend." 
               Welland looked up, and met her glance. 
               "Very precious to me," he said, "are these assurances. To be considered a dear friend by those I respect so highly, is a satisfaction that counterbalances all the odium with which the people of this neighborhood seem to regard me. Still, Miss Goldman, I am about to abuse the confidence with which your parents have regarded me, and carried away by my passion, I am about to commit an act unworthy of a man of honor." 
               "You are incapable of it, sir," cried Antonia with enthusiasm. "I myself would vouch for your honor." 
               The blood rose to Welland's cheeks, and his eyes burned with that brilliant, far-off light which shines from the stars of a Southern sky. 
               "You shall be the judge," he said. "It is but a few months ago that with small means and unknown I came to this region and entered the house of your parents. There I was received with an open and graceful hospitality that recalled the sense of home to me, to me, who has been homeless for so long a period. This kindness diminished not when scandalous reports regarding my former life were spread by an enemy, and found, as I now know, general belief in the neighborhood. They permitted me from the first to associate without restraint with their daughter, a young and beautiful lady, whose spirit surpassed even the charms of her personal appearance." 
               "Mr. Welland," cried Antonia in a voice choking with emotion, "that daughter owes to your companionship what no schools or study could ever have taught her. You have opened to her the gates of the highest realms of human thought." 
               Welland pressed the hand he still held in his own, and replied: 
               "And that daughter has opened to me the gates of the highest realms of human happiness. For-I dared to love her." 
               Antonia felt herself grow dizzy, and reel beneath the influence of these words. When consciousness returned she was upheld by the strong arm of Welland. 
                
               "It was ungenerous, it was perhaps dishonorable for me to nourish aspirations in regard to you," he pleaded, "but I couldn't help it! I fought against it, and I thought I could conquer it. But it has conquered me!" 
               She only rested heavier against his arm, and her head was bowed down still lower. 
               "Antonia," he cried, "I love you! Dear Antonia speak one word in reply!" 
               Still no answer, only her head sank low upon his breast. And he, with the fire of passion, threw his arms around her, and pressed her to his beating heart. 
               It was but a moment. Still it was a moment of ineffable bliss. 
               Then Antonia recovered her self-possession, and gently extricated herself from his embrace. 
               "Mr. Welland," she said, in a voice scarce above a whisper, "you have seen that you are not indifferent to me." 
               "Antonia," he replied, trembling with joy and emotion, "you are an angel!" 
               She smiled sweetly; for the compliments of a lover are as precious jewels to a woman. 
               "Let us now remember," continued Antonia, "what is due to my parents. The fact of our love," and she blushed deeply, "is beyond recall, but it leaped into existence without our will." 
               "My reason fought against it, and I have battled with my heart, until I thought it subdued. But a single glance from your eyes was enough to re-light the flame I labored to extinguish." 
               "Then the fault is mine," she said, with a roguish glance. "I confess that I have never fought against this inclination, or battled with my heart, because-" she turned away, and with her handkerchief hid her face, which was covered with blushes. 
               "Because?" cried Welland, seizing her hand, and covering it with kisses. 
               "Because it made me so happy," murmured Antonia. 
               The lover was in raptures. But Antonia restrained him. 
               "Louis Welland," she said, "it was due to our feelings to make this declaration. It is due to my parents to proceed no further. Let us rest satisfied with the consciousness of mutual affection, until the time arrives when you may judge it proper to demand my hand. Is it a compact?" 
               "And you will keep that hand for me? I am selfish, I know. But Antonia, I love you unspeakably!" 
               "You will find me as you leave me. A little older perhaps, but with the same heart." 
               "Give me a keepsake; some token that I may look upon as a memorial of my Antonia." 
               Antonia hesitated for a moment, and then took from the table a small volume, bound in blue and gold, which she had brought with her. 
                
               "Here is Kinkel's Otto, the Hunter; he composed it for his bride. It is as pure and affectionate as my feelings for you. Accept it as a token." 
               Welland took it, and bowed down to kiss her hand. But with a quick motion she touched his head, and bending until her perfumed tresses swept around him, imprinted a light kiss on his brow. 
               At the same moment she escaped by the door. Welland ran after her. But both stopped in surprise at what they beheld. 
               Mr. Sharp, with his face turned to the opposite wall, was executing a pas de seul. He gently and reflectingly hopped from one leg to the other, with the air of a bird that is suffering from some internal disorder, attended by griping pains. But his feelings must have been of an opposite nature, since he accompanied this primitive dance with a tune that sounded much like the purr of a well pleased cat, and that was occasionally interrupted by a short and joyous laugh. As he proceeded, he increased in sprightliness. His humming grew louder, and his leaps were of a more ambitious nature. He seized his long flapping coat tails, and shuffled beautifully, ending with a grand pirouette.
                
               Antonia burst into an immoderate fit of laughter, and Welland underwent tortures in endeavoring to keep countenance. Mr. Sharp looked at her indignantly. 
               "Look at her," he cried, with the voice of an ill-used person, "look at her, Mr. Welland! I've born her, and I've bred her, and she is making fun of me!" 
               The laughing girl hastened away, while her silvery peals inundated the air. But Mr. Sharp was truly indignant. He puffed, and blowed, until he coughed. And when he coughed, he only puffed and blowed the more. And when he had got through his coughing and puffing, he was in quite an alarming state, and had to be assisted to a chair, where he sat with a flushed countenance, and panted for breath. 
               "Do you feel better?" asked Welland, when he was in a condition to be talked to. 
               Mr. Sharp mournfully shook his head. 
               "It wont let me alone. I can't get rid of it," he said. 
               "What is it?" inquired Welland. 
               "What should it be?" returned Mr. Sharp impatiently; "It." 
               "Well, what is your 'it'?" 
               "What is my it Don't you see? my cough. But I got around it the other night. I got the better of it." 
               "Ah!" 
               "Yes. I'll tell you how." Mr. Sharp panted a little more, and then continued: "I had gone to bed, and was just falling asleep when it came upon me. All the evening I had been up and around, and the confounded thing hadn't troubled me a bit! It lay in wait, however, until I was just about to close my eyes. And then, curse it! it shook me, and plagued me, and took away my breath, and wouldn't leave me alone until I had gotten up. But the moment I sat up in my large arm-chair, it stopped. Just notice its spite! Whenever I tried to lay down it pounced on me, and it stopped as soon as I sat up in my chair. 'Devil take you!' I thought, 'I'll be even with you!' So I remained a long time in my chair, and kept very quiet. By and bye, I threw a glance all around, and nothing stirred. So I gently extinguished the lamp, and got out of the chair, very quietly, and on my tiptoes, without making the least noise whatever, I reached my bed. I turned the cover back very softly, and crept in, and covered my head. And, would you believe it? It never noticed that I had gotten out of the chair, but left me alone all night! What do you think of that?" 
               Welland expressed his admiration of Mr. Sharp's genius, and then asked when it would be time for him to start. 
               "After dinner," said Mr. Sharp. "You will dine with me here, and start when the moon rises. My boy Ned will go with you to Kentucky; he knows the passes well. I have a horse ready for him, and have given him the necessary instructions." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XX. 
               THE moon had risen, and the trees stood shivering in the cool night air. There was a watery dimness upon the stars, and their beams trembled like the glances of an eye bathed in tears. Moist vapors floated on the breeze. It was a cold, damp autumn night. 
               Behind the garden at Pineland, Ned, Mr. Sharp's mulatto servant, held a couple of horses. Ned was not alone; the girl of his heart bore him company. They were making the most of the time remaining, and their leave taking was very tender. There was slobbering, to any extent, on Ned's part, and responsive digs in the ribs, on the part of the lady. She was of a bright black color, that looked as if it had been varnished. Her features were pleasing. 
               "Who give you the pistols?" asked the girl. "Niggers doesn't carry pistols." 
               "Mister Welland give me 'em. He think niggers just as good as white folks." 
               "What a fool!" and she laughed as if it were a good joke. "What for God give 'em black skins?" 
               "You donno, girl," said Ned, sagely. "They's just as smart sometimes." 
               "Why, aint they got niggers to wait on 'em then?" asked the girl. "Heigh! wouldn't I make 'em fly? Git out!" 
               "I'se heard 'em say, that all the folks is equal. All the niggers and all the white men." 
                
               "I isn't equal," returned the girl. "I wouldn't be equal with the field hands. Think I'se associate with these common niggers?" 
               "Git out. Mister Welland is coming." 
               It was so. Welland and Sharp left the house, and passed into the moonshine, that lay upon the lawn between it and the garden. A window, in the upper story, was opened. Welland turned, and beheld Antonia. Her golden hair fell upon her shoulders, and her eyes beamed upon him with tender solicitude. She stood there like a fairy, bathed in the rays of the moon, while the yellow glare of a pine wood fire made the lurid background the picture. 
               She held a rose in her hand. Pressing it to her lips, it fluttered in the air, and fell to the ground. Welland was at the spot in an instant, and picked up, not only the rose, but a soft gray silk glove, that had fallen with it. Pressing them to his heart, he kissed his hand to the sweet lady above. For a moment, a handkerchief fluttered on the breeze like a white dove, and then the window was deserted. With a heavy heart he turned his steps to the garden. 
               "Ned knows the way," said Mr. Sharp, pressing Welland's hand. "By to-morrow morning you will reach Taylor's farm in the mountains. He is a northern man, and you will be safe with him until tomorrow night. Then you must travel on, and make for the north of Kentucky." 
               "My dear friend, good bye," replied Welland, heartily. "I shall never forget your kindness. May we meet again in quieter times! For all the friendship you have shown me, may God bless you." 
               And thus they parted. Sharp looked long after him, and then lifted his face to the pale moon above. A flush, as of youth, seemed to pass over his features. His lips grew red, his cheeks glowed, and his eyes brightened. 
               "Like his mother! Like his mother!" he murmured, "calm, self-possessed, good and true! I thought I should have recognized those eyes among a thousand, and yet, if Hassel had not given me the particulars of his family, I would have looked upon him as a stranger to this day. Oh, what glorious eyes his mother had! I grow young again in thinking of them. Little did she imagine, when the wounded French soldier boy was quartered on her family, that he would keep alive his love for her through many years, and show it at last in benefiting her son. Beautiful lady," he cried, turning his blushing old face up to the sky, "thou art an angel now, and my love is neither a presumption, nor a sin." 
               Meanwhile Welland trotted gaily on, with Ned bringing up the rear. Ned's horse bore a portmanteau containing the young man's papers and instruments, together with some of his clothes. The rest of his possessions Sharp had promised to send on. Welland had also left in his hands letters for the State authorities, in which he resigned his position, with an explanation of the reasons that forced him to do so. 
               It is almost beyond belief at this time, the rapid and simultaneous uprising in the border States, after Lincoln's election to the Presidency. In the more southern regions of the country, the slave-holding party was too universal, too dominant to leap into action at once, when the result of the election was announced. Not so in the border States. Feelings had run high there; and these were not mere feelings against far distant States, but feelings against your neighbor of different political views, and feelings against the people of abolitionist opinions, living in your midst. It was very natural. In the border States the one part of the population had to anticipate every sort of antagonism from the other. They feared that their slaves would be incited to revolt, or run off to the North. They feared that the votes of the mechanics in the cities, with those of the small farmers, would, combined, form a considerable power. And finally, they did not like the success which generally attended the laborious and saving immigrants from the North. 
               On the other hand, the northern settlers took every opportunity to attack the peculiar institution. They could gain wealth in Tennessee, but they were socially put down, and involuntarily imposed upon and awed by the hereditary aristocracy of the State. It was Madison Avenue against Fifth Avenue. Hereditary wealth against Shoddy. The man who has earned his dollars, against the man who, ignorant of the world's battles and struggles, has lived a life of refinement and mental culture on the wealth he inherited. To the one, the dollars represented so much sweat and labor, and so many hard years of his life, to the other, they were the means of enjoyment, of cultivation, and of satisfying his noble or ignoble desires-but nothing more. A state of society like this, in a republic where the principles of equality find official recognition and social endorsement, is always irritating beyond measure to the self-made part of the population. Conscious of their own merits in building up a fortune, they are also conscious of the stains of meanness and dirt left upon their hands by the process, and of the important place which money will always occupy in every one of their calculations. They bow then to classes that, having been raised in the lap of great fortunes, treat this great idol money in a nonchalant and chivalresque manner, and they hate these classes for being compelled to bow before them. It is the old story of king Philip II claiming precedence of his father, the emperor Charles V, because he was the son of an emperor, while his father was but the son of a king. 
               In Tennessee the flames burst out first, and even at present, fiery coals continue to glow there, under the ashes of the late rebellion. 
               Welland and his guide did not remain upon the highway. By lanes and paths they went in a northern direction, expecting to reach the mountain pass by means of a cross road not much in use. The night was dark, for the moon soon went to sleep lapped in a bed of clouds, and the stars were far from bright. This was an advantage to our traveler, who would have found it unpleasant to be discovered, and in the company of a negro especially, as the latter circumstance might have been taken as evidence against him. Fortunately he did not encounter any one. Through the deep silence he rode, with eyes gazing bravely into the future. Had he not a rose warm with Antonia's kisses, and a glove fragrant from the touch of her hand, to bid his loving heart hope? Did not the old God who had conducted him safely through so many difficulties, still live? And more than all, had he not a guardian angel watching over him in the mother he had lost so early, and of whom he never ceased to think, as if her spirit were really floating in the air he breathed? 
               These were the thoughts which passed through his mind. 
               "Take care Massa," said Ned, after a ride of several hours, "we must ford the river here. Ferry boat is further up stream. Massa Sharp said, not cross with ferry boat." 
               "Well Ned, do you ride in advance. You know the ford I suppose?" 
               "Know it? I knows every ford in Claiborne County. The water am high now, and the horses will go in pretty deep." 
               Welland put the stirrups across his saddle, and his legs over the horse's shoulders. Thus, with Ned preceding, and the swift, dark water rushing around him, he passed over the Clinch river. 
               On the opposite side, the road entered a dark wood of pines and cypresses, and at the distance of about a half mile took an abrupt turn. As they neared this turn, the negro suddenly pulled Welland's sleeve, and pointed to a bright glow above the trees, in the direction toward which the road led. Both halted immediately. 
               "Let me go and see, Massa," said Ned. "I think it's a fire, and maybe its some of the white folks watching for you." 
               Welland held the horse, while Ned went swiftly forward to reconnoiter. Soon he returned. 
               "Donno what people they is. They's three men with guns and packs, and they's asleep on their packs. I doesn't think they am of this State." 
               "Must we pass them on this road? Is there no other path to get by?" 
               "Yes, Massa, there am. But it's hard to travel." 
                
               "Lead on then. I had rather avoid doubtful company at present." 
               Ned turned back a little way, and then dismounting, led his horse into the swamp. The path was very narrow, and scarce perceptible to eyes unaccustomed to swamp roads. The animals had great difficulty in getting through the soft, mushy ground that formed it, which on either side was skirted by deep, pond-like stretches of water; from these rose the enormous black trunks of cypress trees, with their strangely-shaped knees and excrescences overhanging the dark, smooth water, and their melancholy boughs shutting out every glimpse of the sky. As they proceeded, the trees grew thicker, and the path softer. The horses and men sank knee deep into the mud at every step. Finally Welland halted. 
               "It is impossible to go on, Ned." 
               "Jist a few steps, Massa Welland. We am almost at the canal." 
               They continued their march with nothing but the plashing of mud breaking the silence, until the trees thinned out, and they emerged upon a fair road, at the side of a canal filled with black, stagnant water. 
               "This am Jericho canal," said Ned. "Now we can ride sharp for the Pass." 
               They gave their horses a rest, and then put spurs to them. Glad to have gotten upon a fair road, both animals threw up their heads, and galloped along in fine style. The muffled sound of their hoofs was reverberated from the dense woods. The night breeze lifted their manes, and cooled the brows of the riders. Gradually the trees grew thinner. Bushes and swampy undergrowth supplied their places. These, in turn, gave way to fields of dry, hard weeds, about three feet high, with a young pine tree now and then breaking the monotony of their dun-colored masses. At last there were spare bits of pasture and barren rocks. The canal had disappeared. The scenery on every side grew bolder. At no great distance, a chain of hills of considerable height arose, while the horizon line was concealed by the blue masses of lofty mountains. 
               They were compelled to moderate their pace as the road gradually ascended, and wound around, and between the hills. Rocks of gigantic size, covered with lichens, and streaked with the blood-red marks of iron ore, frowned upon them from the roadside. Rifted banks, knit together by the mighty roots of the trees that crowned them, overhung the way, and deep clefts and precipices appeared at times to intercept their course. 
               "We are now approaching the Pass, I believe," said Welland. 
               "Yes," replied Ned, "Taylor's house is not far." 
               When they had ridden a mile further, the negro pointed to a rocky path, which led off from the main road. 
               "Massa Sharp," he said, "Massa Sharp told me we had better go to the house by the back way." 
               So they followed the path, which wound around the body of a hill through pine woods, from which it suddenly emerged upon a small clearing. On this clearing stood the house. 
               A deep voice bade them halt. 
               "What's your business with me," asked the owner of the voice from one of the windows, but without showing any part of his person. 
               Welland set about to advance. 
               "Stay where you are," cried the voice. "I am well armed." 
               "I was not prepared for such hostile demonstrations," replied Welland. "Mr. Sharp at Pineland directed me to call here, saying that you are a northern man." 
               "Aye, that's what I am. Of northern birth and principles. But what do you want with me?" 
               Ned took the word. 
               "Massa Taylor, we wants to rest here till night. We am traveling north. I'se Mr. Sharp's boy, and sent along to show the way." 
               "If you are a northern man," said Welland, "you'll not refuse me hospitality. I've been driven from Sycamore because I am supposed to be an abolitionist. I shall travel on to-night. But the horses need rest, before they can go on." 
               The owner of the house appeared in the doorway. 
                
               "I bid you heartily welcome," he said, extending a big brawny fist, and motioning them to come near. "I don't know how safe a shelter I can give you. I've sent my own family to my wife's parents in Ohio, to be out of the way of trouble. The mean vermints may attack me at any hour, and burn my shanty. For they know that I am an abolitionist." 
               "Why have you staid yourself?" Welland could not help asking. 
               "Well stranger," said the other, leading him into a nice, clean sitting-room, and putting away his rifle, while Ned took care of the horses, "I, too, was about leaving. But I kind of thought that if they were going to burn my house and fixins, and carry off my furniture, I should like to see the house and fixins burn as well as the rest, and I sort of wanted to know who got the furniture. I'd feel sure about it anyway, and that's better than uncertainty." 
               "After I've given you something to eat," continued Taylor, "I want the boy to help me take the horses to a safe place in the mountains. We may be driven out here, and then we'd be hard up without horses." 
               "In a little while, a rough repast was ready, of which Taylor and his guest partook by the light of the pine wood fire, upon which the host had fried the meat and boiled the coffee. Ned, at a respectful distance, also partook of his share. Then a flask of spirits passed around the circle. 
               "And now, we must house the horses," began Taylor; "daylight peeps over the mountains." 
               Welland threw himself upon a couch to rest. The rifle was at his side, to defend the house, if necessary, in the absence of the owner. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               IT was late in the afternoon of the same day. Welland, ready to continue his journey with the fall of darkness, was listening to the advice of his host concerning the route, when Ned rushed in upon them with a frightened countenance. 
               "There's a lot of white men coming, with guns," cried the negro, "and they've got a dog with them." 
               "I am endangering your house," said Welland to Taylor. "I shall leave it at once." 
               "Don't go," replied the other. "They're after me as much as after you." 
               "What do you intend to do? How many are they, Ned?" 
               "About twenty, I think, and they's got guns." 
               "Resistance is impossible," urged Welland. "Let us get away. If we repulse these, more will come." 
               But Taylor was immovable. 
               "I know I shall be driven out," he said. "But I wont leave of my own free will. I wouldn't feel right toward the old house, if I was to leave it to those rascals, without making a show of fight." 
                
               "Very well," said Welland. "We can retreat at any time through the back door, if we can only keep them at bay till dark. Fortunately the sky is covered with clouds, and there will be no moon." 
               "If you are going to stop with me," said Taylor, "which I don't ask, you'd better send the boy away to the horses, and have him wait there. They've got a dog, and if the boy is with us, they can trace our steps easily." 
               "Perhaps it is best," replied Welland. "Ned go up, and stay with the horses." 
               The negro obeyed with great alacrity. 
               "Now, look to your, pistols and your powderflask," said Taylor. "Have you given your baggage to the boy?" 
               "Yes. Where are you going to post yourself." 
               "On this side. I have cut a hole through the wall. Over there is another, through which you can fire." 
               "Very well. But can't they attack us in the rear?" 
               "No. There is but one path, and that I have made impassable to-day. They've got to take us in front." 
               The attacking party arrived in front of the house. They were poor whites of the most miserable description, but well armed, and led by Hassel, who had Tourtelotte's hound "Ugly" with him. 
               The gambler advanced to the door and knocked. There was no answer. He repeated the knock. 
                
               "What do you want here?" inquired Taylor. 
               "We want to get in." 
               "You can't come in." 
               "We'll beat the door down, if you don't open," cried Hassel. "We are twenty men, sent from town." 
               "I don't care how many you are, nor who sent you. This is my house. I am a peaceful citizen, and I don't want you in here." 
               "The cursed abolitionist is going to resist," cried Hassel to the others. "Come here some of you, and kick down this door." And he began doing so himself. 
               A sharp report was heard, followed by a shriek from the gambler, who hastily retreated. A bullet had pierced the fleshy part of his arm. 
               The others immediately discharged their pieces at the house, but without any effect whatever. Thereupon they drew back behind a clump of pines, and held a council of war. 
               In a little while, one of them advanced, waving a white handkerchief, and said: 
               "Don't shoot, Mr. Taylor, we don't come here to harm you." 
               "What do you want of me, then?" 
               "We want to search your house. We are pursuing a young devil of an abolitionist, who has carried a nigger off." 
               "You see," whispered Welland. "It is I that have brought this danger upon you." 
                
               "Nonsense," laughed Taylor. "I'm their game just as much as you." 
               "Well," he cried to those outside, "you can't search my house, or come in. Get away from my premises, for I don't want any of you here." 
               "This will cost you dearly," cried Hassel from behind the trees. "If we have to use force, you shall rue it." 
               "I guess you wont hang me, before you've caught me," replied the other. "Patience is a great virtue." 
               "Curse you, miserable hound," cried the gambler, sending a bullet toward the house, which proved as harmless as the others. 
               The attacking party saw that they could not succeed by force, without exposing themselves to the bullets of the inmates of the house. They were unwilling to incur this risk, and concluded to watch the dwelling on every side, and wait for night, in order to approach in under cover of darkness. Withdrawing from the immediate grounds, and entering the woods, they scattered in various directions. Each was to approach from a different side. At the same time some employed themselves in gathering pieces from the decayed trunks of the pitch pine. These were for the purpose of setting fire to the house, if other means of gaining possession failed. Hassel directed the movements of the rest, and he purposed to carry on a regular siege. The pain of his wound increased a thousandfold sandfold the ill feeling he bore Welland. He vowed to himself that he would have the other's life, to get rid of his airs of superiority. "The world is not wide enough to hold us both," he murmured. "One of us must go. As for the next world, if there is one, we are not in danger of meeting." His bitter laugh betrayed the desolation of his heart. 
               Meanwhile, the besieged party was not very comfortable. The total cessation of hostilities on part of the others, showed them but too clearly that a plan of attack had been adopted, which was to be carried out under cover of darkness. 
               "We must abandon the house as soon as it is dark enough," said Welland, "or we are lost. Are all the shutters on the ground floor well secured?" 
               "They are. I don't fear the vermints. We can keep them off for a while yet." 
               Night fell. With it, and just before the two were about to slip out of the house by the cellar door, they noticed the cautious approach of the others. Creeping over the ground, they came from all sides. Each carried a fagot of pitch pine and his gun. Slowly the two got back, mounted to the upper story, and prepared to defend themselves. Welland opened one shutter in the rear, and discharged three of the barrels of his revolver at as many of the assailants. Two were wounded, and withdrew into the woods. But the third darted forward, and gained a position under the stoop, from which it was impossible to dislodge him. In the meanwhile, Mr. Taylor had not been idle. Those that approached in front were repulsed by the quick succession of shots with which he saluted them. One was wounded. The others would have lost their courage, but for Hassel. He proposed that they should light the pitch pine and throw it upon the roof, from the nearest point of cover. But each refused to make a mark of himself by showing a light. Just then a bright blaze shone out in the rear of the house. The man that gained a cover under the back stoop, had lighted his fagot and set fire to the building. The dry stoop blazed up with the rapidity of tinder, and illumined the woods and hills far and near. With a cry of exultation, the whole party hastened to that side, leaving Hassel alone to keep watch on the front door. 
               "Now is our time," said Welland. "We must get out by the front door." 
               "Wait a moment," replied Taylor. "First of all, we must draw their fire." 
               He opened a shutter with great caution, and having placed his hat upon a stick, slowly protruded it from the window. It was on that side where the stoop was burning, and where the majority of the besiegers were assembled. They heard the creak of the shutter, and no sooner did the hat appear before their eager eyes, than every gun in the party was discharged at it. With a doleful groan, Taylor dropped the stick, and seizing his hat, whispered sharply: 
               "Follow me, and don't fire, on any account." 
               They ran out by the front door, and with noiseless leaps, sought to gain the shelter of the woods. Suddenly Hassel arose before them with leveled gun. His eye was blazing with fury, but the wounded arm refused to obey the mandates of his will, and the gun shook unsteadily in his hands. Without pausing, Taylor knocked him down, and did it with a strength and energy that rendered the gambler senseless. Escaping further observation, they got among the pines. 
               "Now after me," said Taylor. "We must make for the Spanish Saddle. If we can reach that before they pursue us, we are safe." 
               They hurried through the woods, first circumventing the house, then following a direction which led in a straight line away from the burning stoop. Soon they emerged upon a path that was illuminated by flashes from the flaming house. It led steeply upward, and then around the brow of a hill, which seemed but the stepping stone to a higher hill beyond. They turned simultaneously. The house stood in full blaze, but they vainly tried to make out the forms of their antagonists. 
               "They are probably on the other side, or among the pine trees," observed Taylor. "Let us hurry forward." 
                
               They bounded over the path. It was rough and stony. At times it seemed to disappear altogether. At others it led along precipices. Springs crossed it. And formidable rocks had to be scrambled over. At last they came upon a broad road. 
               "This is the Pass," said Taylor, wiping the sweat from his brow, with a relieved look, "and yonder is the Spanish Saddle." 
               A little walk brought them to the spot indicated. It was a passage between two rocks, about three feet wide, and narrowed still more by masses of creepers and undergrowth. The rocks, on either side, were thought to look like the high pommels of a Spanish saddle, while the passage itself not inaptly represented the seat. On both sides of these rocky projections were deep declivities, that skirted the road on to the north for some distance, and even extended for a few feet on the hither side. The approach from the south was through a narrow, rocky defile, the highest point of which was the "Saddle." The path, whereupon Taylor and Welland had come, followed the course of a rivulet down the precipitous side of this defile, and struck the main road that ran through it, not far from the Saddle. For over three quarters of a mile the road ascended steeply, and for nearly all that distance it was commanded by this rocky passage. A better military position, for a few to hold against numbers, could not be conceived. Welland land appreciated its merits in a moment. 
               "We are safe here," he said. 
               "Now," spoke Taylor, after a short rest, "I will go for the horses. You've got a couple of revolvers, and you must hold the Saddle against them. They can't get at you except by the road, for the precipices extend beyond the Saddle. The sides of the defile are not high enough to shoot at you from that point. So there is no possibility of taking your position, if you are watchful." 
               "Depend on me," said Welland. 
               Both passed over the Saddle. Welland to take up his position of defense behind one of the pommels, and Taylor to strike into the woods, below and beyond, to get the horses. 
               Their own hurry, and the noise of the woods and rivulets, had until now made them inattentive to sounds of pursuit. But as Welland sat down, keeping his eye steady upon the road, it seemed to him as if the tone of a deep, hoarse bark was borne upon the breeze. It arose, at intervals, above the plashing of the neighboring springs. It seemed to come nearer, and there was little doubt of the fact that a bloodhound was upon their track. 
               The young man kept his pistols ready. But it was very dark, especially in this rocky defile. He strained his eyes to the utmost, as he heard the gradual approach of the noise, but could perceive nothing that would offer a mark for his pistols. There was an interval of several minutes, in which the silence was unbroken. Then a swift rush, and, with a short sharp bark, the hound was upon him. The attack was so sudden, that, bent forward as he had been, it bore him to the ground. In the fall he lost his pistol; he felt the hound's breath on his cheek, saw his eyes burn, and the white gleam of his teeth, as he prepared to seize and throttle him. It was but a moment. At such times, however, ideas rush through the brain with remarkable swiftness. Welland recollected at this instant some story of his childhood, that he had not thought of for years, and in which a king of England, unarmed, is attacked by a lion. The royal hero, quickly resolved, thrust his gauntleted fist deep down between the jaws of the monster, and embracing him with the other arm, held him thus, until an opportune courtier rushed up and killed him. Like lightning, Welland's own fist, with the stout buckskin glove upon it, flew into the jaws of the hound and down his throat, while his other arm pressed the struggling form to his panting bosom. It was a fierce combat. The hound was very powerful, but Welland had been a Turner, and practiced gymnastic games ever since his childhood. This came him in good stead. The animal, which felt itself choking, bounded from the ground, in its endeavors to shake off the adversary, and with its sharp nails tore through his clothes deep rents into the flesh. But of the teeth that guarded the powerful jaws, it could make no use. Thus, with the bloodhound's head pressed close to his own, with its strong heart beating in mighty thumps against his breast, and with his arm locked closely around its writhing body, Welland passed a minute and a half, that seemed a century. He felt himself grow dizzy. His senses were slowly taking leave, while the struggles of the hound grew more frantic. A few more seconds, and his muscles must relax; the fierce beast would lock its teeth in his throat. He was lost. At that moment his fleeting consciousness was recalled by the report of a rifle. The hound escaped from his arms with a mighty bound, and fell dead into the abyss at the side of the road. Welland was seized by the friendly arms of Ned and borne to a spring, where a little water dashed into his face, soon recalled him to a remembrance of the dangers overcome, and of those still threatening. 
               "Let us mount," he cried, "and away!" 
               They helped him to mount his horse, and his eagerness was such that he forgot the hurts he had received. Nor was there time for delay. The pursuers had not been far behind the dog, and the sound of the gun called them to the spot. But too late. Our friends had a good start, and their horses soon carried them beyond the reach of danger. Next morning, Welland was housed in a good, old fashioned Kentucky tavern, where Taylor dressed his wounds himself, to avoid suspicion. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXII. 
               BY slow stages our hero crossed Kentucky, and arrived at Cincinnati. Ned insisted upon following him. He maintained that this was in accordance with Mr. Sharp's orders. Once at Cincinnati, Welland called the negro to him, and said: 
               "Now Ned, we must part. I will give you letters to Mr. Sharp and the family at Pineland, and you can return whenever you are ready." 
               "Donno about that, sir!" replied Ned. "I wants to go north, and Massa Sharp give me this paper for you to let me go with you." And he drew it from his pocket, and laid it on the table. 
               Welland glanced at it. It was a permission for the negro boy Edward to go north, and earn his living there as he best could. Inclosed was a note to Welland, stating, that under present circumstances, it was not advisable to procure liberation papers for the boy, but that they would be forwarded to him before long. In the meanwhile, he might prove a good servant to Welland, whom he requested to take care of him. 
               "Very well," said Welland. "You can come with me, Ned, though I did not dream that our connection would be permanent. So you want to go north." 
                
               "Yes sir. Will you let me be your servant?" 
               "I don't know, my boy, that I will be able to afford a servant, or that such will be the most advantageous position for you. We will see, when we get to New York." 
               "Very well, sir. When do we travel?" 
               "This evening." 
               Welland descended to the table, and was soon busy eating his soup. When he had finished, he raised his eyes and took a survey of his company. With pleasant surprise, he recognized in his vis-a-vis, Reichenau, the Memphis merchant. That old gentleman glanced up at the same time, and smiled affably, as he in turn recognized Welland. In a moment, they were deep in conversation. Their mutual experiences since their last meeting, the precarious state of the country, and the objects of their present journey, furnished ample food for discussion. 
               "I shall not return to Memphis until the present excitement has subsided," said Reichenau. "I am abandoning great commercial interests there, but as I look for an eventual state of quiet, I do not count them lost. These border States are at present no place for a northern man to abide in." 
               "That has been my experience," replied Welland. "So I return to New York, though without a definite idea of finding any suitable employment there." 
               "Would you accept a position in a mercantile establishment on a large scale?" inquired the other. "I might be instrumental in procuring you one." 
               "That depends much upon the position itself," replied Welland. "Thanks for your kind intentions." 
               They did not part again. The more they conversed, the more did Reichenau like Welland. He invited him to defer his journey till next morning, and then both traveled together to the metropolis. Usually it is difficult for people who travel for thirty-six hours together, not to grow heartily tired of each other. They exchange the general ideas, which each keeps ready like small coin for casual expenditures, and then hesitate to draw upon their deeper inner nature in behalf of acquaintances, that may cease to be such, with the end of the journey. Not so with Welland and Reichenau. They were both strong, though quiet characters, and having taken a mutual liking, did not hesitate to put forth the salient points of their natures. The contrast could not be but entertaining. On the one hand, the highly educated gentleman, the University man, with the refined sensibilities of the German literary aristocracy, and yet with no end of respect for practical men and views. On the other, the man of business, successful in practical life, with a good general training, and a heart that bowed in admiration before the sciences and arts, and those who represented them; and moreover, with a secret conviction, that he would have excelled in them, had he studied, instead of following mercantile pursuits, and on this account looking with a half-regretful glance at the vast fortune he had succeeded in accumulating. 
               When they neared the great city, Reichenau, affectionately placing his hand on Welland's shoulder, said: 
               "You must be my guest, sir! Don't open your lips to refuse me, for I will not take a refusal." 
               "This is very kind, Mr. Reichenau. But if our acquaintance is not too short for you to invite me, it is too short for me to accept. Beside," he added, smiling, "I have an encumbrance in Ned." 
               "Your servant. He must come along, of course. Don't say another word about it, but permit me to look upon the matter as settled. If you have any objections to urge, let me hear them a week from now." 
               "As you insist, I will accept your invitation for a week; no longer. Do not forget sir, that I am of moderate means looking for employment, and might not prove acceptable to persons in your circle. As for yourself, I do you the justice to hold you exempt from such prejudices." 
               "And you do me but justice. I insist on seeing men of mind and cultivation at my house, because they impart to me of their ideas and learning, which I am eager for. I don't care for seeing people that have no merit but that of being rich, because I don't want to borrow their money. Thanks for your acquiescence." 
               So, when they reached town, they entered a carriage, and drove to Reichenan's mansion. That kind old gentleman immediately saw Welland bestowed in a pretty little bed-room, saying: 
               "You must be content with small spaces and little rooms, my dear sir. House lots are narrow on Fifth Avenue." 
               "I can get all my baggage in," laughingly replied Welland, pointing to the portmanteau which Ned had brought up, and which contained all he had with him. 
               "Thanks to your Tennessee friends, I suppose," rejoined Mr. Reichenau, and with a caution about dinner, which would soon be announced, he hastened to his own room. 
               Welland at once proceeded to dress, as well as his limited wardrobe permitted him. He hoped that Sharp had sent the rest of his baggage, for, thought he, I will need all my finery while staying here. At the same time he did not, under the circumstances, feel the least embarrassment on account of the shortcomings of his wardrobe. Full dress was an impossibility, and he made the best of what was at his command. While dressing, he took a rapid survey of his position. His sojourn in Tennessee had not been profitable in a pecuniary point of view. He had expended as much as his salary amounted to, and the price of the horse, which he had sold at Cincinnati, was perhaps all the money he brought away from his earnings in that State. The sum which he had saved from the wreck of his inheritance, and had taken with him to the United States, together with scraps of his fortune that were in the hands of friends and had been remitted afterwards, he had kept untouched, and at this time they amounted to a fair competence for a man of moderate views. But not for Welland. Without being extravagant, he adhered to the luxurious habits of the class he had belonged to in the old world, and to sacrifice one of the elegancies of life, or give up a reasonable wish because it involved expense, was a thought that he could not bear. With these views, it was surprising that he had gotten along, and not touched his capital. Still, his income had always been considerable, and his work, by occupying time, had also limited expenditure. 
               Now he was again in New York, and perhaps with the caprice of his class and age, rather unwilling to return to former employments. At the same time his pride revolted against taking advantage of Mr. Reichenau's kindness, and it needed all the suavity of the old gentleman, and his own liking for him, to smooth the ruffled plumes of that cardinal sin. But having once accepted his hospitality, he accepted it wholly with the grace and bonhommie of a gentleman. 
                
               At last he was ready. Vest and pantaloons of delicate gray, with a silk tie of the same color, and a black matinee coat. His magnificent hair fell in clusters of curls around the open brow, and, his dark eyes shone all the more brightly, for the kiss he imprinted on the little book Antonia had given him. Ned, who was in attendance, received an exalted idea of his master's piety from this action, for he supposed the little book to be a bible, as a matter of course. The negro was in high glee over the sights he had seen during their transit from the depot, and he was ready to abandon Tennessee for good, on condition of being permitted to stay in New York. 
               When Welland descended, he found the family already assembled in the parlor. Mr. Reichenau led him to aunt Margaret, and introduced him with a flattering remark, at the same time giving expression to the hope that he would remain their guest for some time. Then he presented him to his daughter. Emma Reichenau arose, and curtsied. Welland bowed, and remained standing before the young lady, lost in admiration of her dazzling beauty. She was dressed in black lace, and her throat of antique magnificence, rose from the dark soft dress, like the form of a swan from the blue surface of the water. The glory of her eyes was transcendant, and the full red lips seemed to throb with the warm life of her young being. There was an atmosphere fraught with electric warmth, a sphere of intoxicating perfume around her, which could not fail to exert its influence on so sensitive and poetic a nature as that of Welland. He sank upon the sofa at her side, and inhaled with full breaths, all the charm of her neighborhood. Her prattle, which was of infantile grace, served but to increase the magnetic effect of her beauty. 
               "Since you have been in Tennessee, will you tell me what keeps papa there, most of the time? Are the attractions so great that we can not counteract them here?" asked the young lady. 
               "I do not think Mr. Reichenau intends to return at present," replied Welland, vainly seeking to collect his thoughts. 
               "Thank you for the news. I shall be so glad to have him here. Yes," she added, reflectingly, "but for one thing." 
               "And that is? if I may be allowed to ask-" 
               "That I must play classic music to him. Isn't that a bore?" 
               Welland laughed. "While I have the honor of being your guest," he said, "I shall be glad to relieve you." 
               "Do you like to play classic music?" cried Emma, with astonishment. "What fun! He will make you play Beethoven, and even Gluck, who has no tunes at all." 
               "It is true," replied the young man, "Gluck has no tunes. But he has all the more music." 
               "Please don't speak in riddle. You don't look like a professor, and you shouldn't speak like one; I am very shallow, and couldn't understand you." 
               "Well, I will try to explain. You have heard of the troubadours?" 
               "I have even seen the picture of one. A beautiful youth with a cap full of plumes, a slashed jacket, and a harp in his hand. He had a black moustache." 
               "You know that they were poets and minstrels. When they were inspired by the beauty of a lady, or the valor of a knight, or a noble action, they composed verses, and declaimed them to the accompaniment of the harp or lute. Whenever their poetry demanded song, they would burst forth into a melody suitable to the meaning of their words. That was the beginning of music." 
               "How could they ever do it without preparation?" 
               "I do not say that they did it without preparation. All music is an amplification of this first principle, and has for its purpose a better expression of the sense than language can convey. Gluck's music is composed in accordance with this interpretation, and is therefore declamatory song, nothing more." 
               "Do you think I am wise enough to understand all this?" asked Emma, with a charming smile. 
               "Why not, if you try? Your appearance would be well calculated to inspire a minstrel, why should you not try to understand stand their manner of expressing admiration?" 
               "If you are resolved to teach me in so pleasant a style, I must needs become learned. But, in fact, I am a light minded girl, with my thoughts on balls, dresses, and amusements. I care more for the fashions than for the arts and sciences, and I believe that I am too stupid to understand the latter." 
               Their conversation was interrupted by the call to dinner. During the meal, Welland was engaged in a discussion with Mr. Reichenau, of pictures in European galleries. More than once, as his voice rose in enthusiastic description and his face glowed, were Emma's brilliant orbs fastened upon his speaking countenance. When dinner was over, they found Mr. Charles Goldman in the parlor. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               DURING dinner, Welland had been in a state of exaltation, caused by the extraordinary beauty of Emma Reichenau. He was like one walking in rich tropical woods, listening to the strange, passionate song of unknown birds, and inhaling powerful perfumes. Every nerve in his body was tingling with excitement, every artery beat higher. This sort of magnetic state seemed to re-act on the person who had caused it. Never had Emma's eyes shone with greater luster, never had her face exhibited a more radiant look. Never had that peculiar intoxicating influence which surrounded her, been more subtle and pervading. 
               When they beheld Charles Goldman, it had on both the effect which the breaking of an electric chain produces, on those forming it. They became conscious of a sensation that resembled a fracture. Welland felt as if a cool breeze had sprung up, and kissed his brow. It seemed as if the fresh airs of morning, the brightness of dew drops, the early light of the sun had come, and dispelled at once the influences that held his soul captive. Emma, on her side, grew pale, and the peculiar Brightness of her glance was dimmed. With hesitating coldness, she introduced Mr. Goldman to Welland, who greeted him with cordial words. 
               But Charles Goldman was irresponsive. He felt in his own soul the shock, with which he had broken in upon their magnetic circle. He stammered some words in reply to Welland's civilities, and then plunged into a conversation with Mr. Reichenau, on political affairs in Tennessee. Aunt Margaret sat placidly attentive to the needlework she was engaged in, and nothing remained for Welland but to resume his seat at the side of Emma. He did so with reluctance, and yet with pleasure. 
               "What effects different persons have upon us," he said to Emma. "Some attract tract us powerfully, others repulse us, and we are not able to account for either feeling, except by the involuntary impression of our soul? Have you not been affected thus?" 
               "Often," replied Emma. "But aunt has always laughed at me. She never likes or dislikes anybody but for good reasons." 
               "It is only natures delicately strung that are affected by the contact with others differently constituted. The Aeolean harp vibrates to the sigh of every breeze." 
               "But is not our plain sense as good a guide in the judgment of persons, as a feeling or pre-disposition we can give no reason for?" 
               "Some say not. Our sense frequently errs. The impulses of our inner nature rarely." 
               "But is it not awful, if we are to be judged by some intuitive impulses, instead of our works? We would suffer for all the wickedness we might be capable of, at the same time that we had never actually been able to make up our mind to commit a single sin." 
               "True. Perhaps we should not allow those feelings to prompt our decisions unless supported by other evidence. Now you affect me strangely." 
               "Do I? How? Do you feel prompted to hate me?" 
               "On the contrary. I feel strongly attracted to you." 
                
               "That is strange. I also feel drawn toward you." 
               Emma stopped. Her form was again throbbing with the pulses of an excess of vitality; her eyes were again a-glow with magnetic fire, and her lips burned with a scarlet, that seemed to emit rays. Welland had felt, for some time, warm currents steal over him, like perfumed serpents, and fold their glittering coils around his better, purer nature. He breathed as in an atmosphere of musk, and strange noises, like the songs of unknown birds, were ringing in his ears. For the second time it was Charles Goldman that broke the spell. 
               "You have been in the neighborhood of my home," said the young man. "Can you tell me any thing of my family, Mr. Welland?" 
               "Certainly," replied the other. "I have been the guest of your parents many times, and I passed my last days in Tennessee at Pineland." 
               "Indeed! If I am not interrupting a pleasant discussion, pray let me ask you to relate all you can recollect of my family. I have been so long from home." 
               "I will give Mr. Welland up to you," said Emma. "You can compare notes, while I talk to papa." 
               The two young men began to converse. With great surprise, Charles Goldman heard of Welland's adventures in his native county, and of his manner of leaving it. It was evident that he had not the least suspicion of the latter's intimate relations with his own family; nor did Welland attempt to enlighten him, as a task of that sort is always embarrassing to the last degree. The other, however, finding his new acquaintance so familiar with persons and places in Claiborne County, hesitated not to inquire: 
               "Did you see much of Frank Tourtelotte?" 
               "Yes. We were friends." 
               "Isn't he the beau ideal of a gentleman? Or rather, of a knight? There is nothing he will not attempt, be it ever so difficult, nothing he will not resign, be it ever so precious. His bravery and generosity know no bounds. It always seems to me as if the knights errant must have been of his mettle." 
               "I agree with you in admiring the many fine qualities of Mr. Tourtelotte," said Welland, coldly; "but I don't think I should choose him as a representative of the knightly character." 
               "And why not, if I may be allowed to ask?" 
               "Because a life of labor and high accomplishments, a heart and conduct of childlike purity, an entire devotion to some great object, distinguish that character. These, Mr. Goldman, I could not find in our friend." 
               "You are too severe, or rather," he added, with a charming smile, "I am prepossessed possessed in Mr. Tourtelotte's favor. You can well imagine the reason why?" 
               "I confess my ignorance. He is a brilliant, brave gentleman, of cultivated mind and manners, and honorable disposition. These may be enough, I grant, to prepossess any one." 
               "You have not heard the rumor then?" asked Charles Goldman. 
               "I do not know to what you refer." 
               "I may as well tell you. There has been a sort of intimacy between Mr. Tourtelotte and my sister for years; in fact since she has been a child. The family have always looked upon this affair with favor, and before long I hope to call that gentleman my brother." 
               Welland could find no words to reply. It seemed as if a blur had come over his vision, and he could not see distinctly the graceful form with light waving hair and blue eyes that sat before him. 
               "You seem surprised at what I tell you," continued Charles Goldman. "Is this so strange a match then in your consideration? I always heard that they were well suited." 
               "Excuse me if I showed surprise. I felt none. On the contrary, I was aware of Mr. Tourtelotte's hopes and plans." 
               "Ah! Did he ever speak to you of his regard for my sister? You must have been very intimate." 
               "We were. Pray, Mr. Goldman, do you intend to remain in New York this winter, not withstanding the troubles in the South?" 
               "I certainly do," replied Charles, with a glance at Emma, that said plainer than words: If any one hoped that I might depart and leave the field in his possession, that one will be disappointed. 
               "My father has many interests in the North that require to be looked to, and if there is trouble at home, they will need my attention here all the more," he added, turning to Welland. "I am at the Fifth Avenue hotel. Will you not do me the honor to call on me, and permit me to improve my acquaintance with one who seems to be looked upon as a friend at Pineland?" 
               "I shall be very happy to do so," replied Welland, anxious to establish friendly relations with Antonia's brother. "What time will suit you best?" 
               "Come and dine with me to-morrow." 
               "Not yet, if you please. I am at present Mr. Reichenau's guest, and it would not be polite to dine out." 
               "What? You are Mr. Reichenau's guest? Do you mean to say that you live here?" 
               "Certainly, for the present. My friend," indicating the host with a wave of his hand, "insisted upon it." 
               Charles gazed at him with flashing eyes, and then heaved a deep, bitter sigh. It was evident that he was on the way to become jealous. 
                
               "If you will be at home to-morrow evening," Welland continued, "I shall be happy to call. Believe me, I desire much a better acquaintance with you," and he looked at him with his quiet, trustful, honest dark eyes. Charles, who had at first cast about to find an excuse for not accepting this visit, could not but yield to the impression which the other's genial face made upon him. 
               "Come," he said, "and I will call you heartily welcome." 
               "Will either of you gentlemen turn the leaves for Miss Reichenau?" asked the merchant, as the young lady sat down at the piano. 
               Both leaped up. But Welland resumed his seat again, leaving to Charles the coveted task. The latter bent over the piano, and seemed eager to inhale every breath that came from Emma's lips. But the girl looked disappointed, and played in a listless manner, not acknowledging her cavalier's glances of passion by a single smile, and scarce showing that she was aware of his presence. This, in turn, nettled him. With a haughty and bitter accent, he invited Mr. Welland to take his place, as an engagement called him away; and took his leave abruptly. 
               "Well," said Mr. Reichenau, "New York society has not improved this young gentleman's manners." 
               "Why, brother?" remonstrated aunt Margaret, "he certainly possesses the most suave and finished manners in our circle. Perhaps he was not quite well to-night. I never saw him act so abruptly." 
               The others were silent. They understood the reason of Charles' departure. And now Welland requested Emma to sing. 
               "What songs do you prefer?" inquired the young lady. 
               "I will be ruled by Mr. Reichenau's taste. From what you have told me, I am sure that it is excellent." 
               "Let us have old ballads, then. Something English." 
               "I have just the thing you will like." 
               After a simple prelude, she began that touching song of "Allan Percy": 
                      
                        "She was a beauteous lady, richly drest, 
                        And 'round her neck were pearls and jewels rare; 
                        A velvet mantle decked her snowy breast-" 
                     
                   and so on, breathing the "Lullaby," as tenderly and softly as the butterfly's kiss on the rose. 
               "This is the first time I have heard you sing not only with expression, but with a deep understanding of the music," remarked Mr. Reichenau. "You have improved wonderfully, Emma." 
               The young lady looked up at Welland with a glance, that told him how much she attributed her success to his presence. Slowly the magic influence of those eyes drew enchanted circles around him, and strange pleasures filled his bosom. The wild intoxicating fumes rose to his brain, and his eyes glowed in turn, not with the quiet, gentle radiance usual to them, but with weird fires. 
                
               Presently it was his turn to sing. With a brilliant accompaniment, he burst into an Italian love song, so warm, so throbbing with the agony of overpowering passion, that even aunt Margaret looked up, with calm surprise upon her placid features. 
               "Though you have praised my taste Mr. Welland," said the merchant, smiling, "I can not praise yours in the choice of songs. In fact, I should have supposed so brilliant and extravagant a composition as the one you have just rendered, to be wholly at variance with every inclination of your nature. Perhaps you have only given it to us as a sample of what this false and super-sentimental age can produce?" 
               Welland replied, covered with blushes: 
               "I have given it in good faith, though I like neither the composer nor the composition. One finds, at times, however, that moods are possible, when music or literature, that have seemed untrue to nature or ridiculously extravagant before, truly express the emotions of the moment." 
               "You mean to say that there are feelings which Verdi is better able to express than Beethoven? No doubt. But those feelings should be placed in the same rank with the music that expresses them. Under lock and key." 
               Welland blushed still more. But Emma was glorious in the brilliancy of her beauty. She even astonished her father, who thought to himself: "I have never seen any thing more beautiful in my life." 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXIV. 
               WHAT a queer character!" said Welland to himself, as comfortably tucked up in bed, he thought over the events of the evening. "I was perfectly helpless before the magic of her beauty. And yet, no sooner had she turned her eyed away, and I had escaped from her immediate neighborhood, than all the effect vanished, and I was even inclined to struggle against her influence. There is a magnetism in her, which, when you come within a certain radius, irresistibly attracts you and holds you in strong fetters. But at a distance she seems powerless, and to my inmost nature even repelling. I never saw such a woman before. It is of this stuff that Cleopatra, Helen, Lais, Diana de Poictiers and others must have been, that turned men crazy when they looked upon them, and made fools and slaves of the wisest, when, they came near them. This girl possesses an immense power, and a terrible beauty. She is a child as yet, and unaware of the arms with which nature has furnished her. Nay, not only is she unconscious, but she suffers from it. But when such a nature awakens, it is the awakening of the tiger. She will use her power with a merciless heart, and trample on those yielding to it with a remorseless step. The only safety for her and her victims, is her encounter with a nature stronger than her own, and well fortified to resist her charms. She will fall captive to such a one, and come out of the struggle with a regenerated spirit, or with a broken heart. Antonia, rosebud of my heart, sweet star of my love, let thy pure spirit guard me from the spells of this innocent and artless, but dangerous witch!" 
               With Kinkel's poem upon his pillow he dropt asleep, and dreamt of the pungently fragrant pine woods, and of a figure in a sky blue habit, mounted on a gray pony, that was cantering through their solemn aisles. 
               On the evening which he had appointed he went to see Charles Goldman. The young man occupied a handsome suit of apartments, Consisting of a parlor, smoking-room and alcove, in one of the lower stories of the hotel. In order to be placed in any reasonable proximity to mother earth in a New York hotel, you must not only be inordinately rich and proportionately free of your money, but also a favorite of the proprietors, or of his high mightiness, the clerk. Charles had succeeded in this, and hence his comfortable lodging, while others climbed upward until it was a serious question, whether they were above the clouds or below them. 
               There was not a trace of vexation left upon the handsome countenance of the young man, as he welcomed Welland to his apartments. The latter in turn took pains to counteract any unpleasantness which the events of the previous evening might have occasioned. As a matter of course, one of the first subjects of discussion, after generalities had been disposed of, was the Reichenau family. Welland related in a simple honest fashion his first meeting with the merchant, their after acquaintance, their journey in company, and the invitation to his house. He also took care to speak of Emma as a very beautiful young lady, but he did so in that tone of indifference, with which one speaks of matters that do not concern one very much. Charles brightened up a great deal, and said in return, that he had admired Miss Reichenau for a long time, and had endeavored to gain her regards. He hoped that she did not look upon him with indifference; it was a very serious matter to him. 
               "I wish you all success, my dear sir," said Welland, heartily. "You could not bring a more beautiful bride to Pineland." 
               "No doubt of that," replied Charles, blushing, and permitting himself to indulge in pleasant anticipations. "She and my sister would turn the heads of half the gentlemen in the county. Did you not think Antonia beautiful." 
               Now it was Welland's turn to blush, and cast down his eyes. "Very," he said in a low voice. 
               "She and Tourtelotte will make a, splendid couple," cried the young man. "I don't see why they hesitate so long. They might have been married already, and I know it isn't Tourtelotte's fault that they arn't, nor my parents, either." 
               "Excuse me," said Welland, with hesitation. "Has it never occurred to you that Miss Goldman might have had scruples of a religious nature?" 
               Charles Goldman blushed violently, and sprang from his chair, crying: 
               "Sir, what do you mean? How dare you insult me thus?" 
               Welland gazed fully into his eyes. "Is my supposition an insult?" he asked, calmly. "I was not aware of it." 
               Charles lost all self-possession. "By whatever chance you got to know of what faith my father is, you have no right to reproach me with it here. You have probably already made capital of your knowledge by imparting it to Mr. Reichenau, and prepossessing him against me. Let me tell you sir, to employ such means against a rival is the height of meanness, and you shall give me satisfaction for it." 
               "Mr. Goldman, permit me to say that I do not understand all this passion, and these reproaches." 
               "What! have you so little of the elements of a gentleman in your nature, that I must strike you, to make you understand?" 
               "If my remark regarding Miss Goldman is offensive, remember, you invited the discussion!" 
               "What business of your's are our religious convictions?" 
                
               "Is that the point? Why, Charles Goldman, I don't know what religion you affect, nor do I care. But as for myself, I am a Jew." 
               This last remark changed the position of affairs sensibly. Whereas Charles had before blushed with anger, it was now with shame. He sat down, and was silent for a long time. Then, looking up timidly, he said: 
               "Have you lost all regard for me, Mr. Welland? I am a moral coward on that point. I can not make up my mind to face continually the charges, just or unjust, which society has been in the habit of bringing against those of the Jewish-those of my father's-those of-our faith. Still, do not think, that I am ashamed of people holding that persuasion, for I associate with a great many, and visit their clubs. And, were, I not so much in love with Emma Reichenau, I would even take a wife from their midst, as my parents urge me to do." 
               "My dear sir," replied Welland, impressively, "what you have said just now, is unworthy of your character: the greatest kindness I can show you, is to forget that you have said it. You have intimated to me in a former conversation, that you are an admirer of chivalric traits; so am I. But the chivalry I admire, is the chivalry of the heart. That chivalry which upholds the unjustly oppressed and calumniated, no matter what odium may result from the action. And beside this, you are a Jew. You may as well tear the nose from your face as endeavor to solve your connection with your people. Whether for good or for ill, to break it, is an impossibility." 
               There was a long silence, and then Charles Goldman seized Welland's hand, and said: 
               "I am young and foolish. Please forgive and forget. We may be friends or not. But I shall always esteem you." 
               "Would that we could be friends," answered Welland, with glistening eyes. 
               Their conversation was interrupted by the call boy, who brought a card to Mr. Goldman. 
               "Bring some wine," said the latter, "and then show the gentlemen up." 
               "My friend Merrins," he explained to Welland, "with a person who wishes to be introduced to me. This will show you that I am not as bad as I seem. Merrins is of our persuasion, and a good, clever fellow, who has been of great service to me in New York. He knows nothing of my visits at Reichenau's, or my acquaintance in their circles, and you would oblige me by saying nothing about it. There is one thing"-he added, laughingly, "he seems determined on." 
               "And that is?" asked Welland, smiling in turn. 
               "To supply me with a wife," roared Charles; "I shouldn't wonder if his present visit was with that object. I do believe lieve," he added, more seriously, "that he has secretly communicated with my parents on that point, for he is so persistent, notwithstanding my rebuffs." 
               "I wish you joy," cried Welland, laughing. 
               At that moment, the boy entered with wine; the visitors followed him. 
               "My dear Mr. Goldman," said Merrins, "permit me to introduce to you Mr. Abraham Watshin, of this city. Retail shoe store, &c., &c." 
               "Glad to see him," said Charles, politely, "but I am well supplied with boots at present." And while he poured out the wine, he whispered to Welland: "Another marriage broker, I'll bet!" 
               "I don't want to sell you any boots," said the new-comer, with a grin. "Perhaps we can make a trade of a different sort." 
               Charles now introduced those present to each other, and seated his visitors. Conversation ran on general topics. 
               Mr. Abraham Watshin was a middle-aged man, with a sharp nose, a bald crown, and a a spare beard surrounding a face that was florid and fleshy, and devoid of moustache. He had high cheek bones, and flabby lips of a blueish tint. His hands were large and red, with black rims around the nails. From the nostrils and ears protruded long, thin hairs, and his fingers were covered with some of the same kind. Grossness and cunning lay in his expression. 
               One must confess that this gentleman understood his business well. He knew how to throw out gentle hints on the blessings and advantages of the married state, and yet did not endeavor to obtrude the subject. Again, when the conversation turned on great singers, he mentioned that he was acquainted with a young lady of exceeding beauty, whose musical talents would even win her fame on the stage, did not her parents, who were exceedingly wealthy, strenuously object to any such thing. He mentioned incidentally that perhaps, on that very account, they were anxious to see her soon, and well married. 
               When the dearth of public amusements was discussed, Mr. Watshin said carelessly: 
               "There will be a little party next week at the house of my young friend, whose vocal powers I have talked of to-night. If you desire it, I shall be happy to procure you an invitation. My friends are always made welcome at the house of her parents." 
               Charles bowed politely, and Mr. Watshin added: 
               "They are very stylish people, and delight in gay parties and such things." 
               Late in the evening, Welland took his leave, with the promise to call again at no very distant period. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXV. 
               WELLAND, in accordance with his promise to Mr. Reichenau, stayed, at his house for one week, and then moved into lodgings. He was happy to escape from the constant influence of that magic which Emma Reichenau seemed to exert. True, he had struggled against it, and aided by his heart's love for the distant Antonia had succeeded in resisting it. Still it entailed a struggle, and he found it unpleasant to be constantly subduing sensations, that his better nature disapproved of. But though living in lodgings, it must be confessed that his visits at the Fifth Avenue mansion were frequent, and his intimacy with the family had even increased. Mr. Reichenau's liking for Welland assumed the character of a permanent friendship, and he seriously thought of means to attach him to his house for good. He not only felt the greatest esteem for his manners, learning, large-hearted views, and that certain je ne sais quoi which distinguishes the habitues of good society, but also for his sound judgment on commercial operations. Still, notwithstanding his repeated and advantageous offers, Welland refused to accept a situation with Reichenau, or with any other commercial house. He took occasional orders for surveys, but concluded that he would devote a few months to his mental culture. In explaining this to Reichenau, he said: 
                
               "The literary and scientific world advances with such giant strides, and produced so much that is new, that it becomes dangerous now-a-days to fall behind. One hazards a complete isolation, a loss of one's position in the scientific ranks of the age, by a few months' neglect of reading. I will devote a little time to brushing up what has grown rusty in my past studies, and to make myself acquainted with the novelties in theory and fact which our prolific age has brought forth. As I am not pressed by circumstances, and disinclined to commercial pursuits, I think it will be the best plan." 
               And so they lived. And more and more the thought came over Reichenau, how he should delight in a son like Welland. And more and more the wish arose in Emma, that this glorious man, whose nature seemed to subdue her, would once, only once depart from his light tone of courtly admiration, and say one flattering word to her in the voice of his heart. But Welland kept strict guard. No sooner did the intoxicating aroma of her presence envelope him as in a cloud of rainbow hues, than the heart of the man awoke, and his will, strong as steel, compelled a quietness of demeanor that nettled Emma, and stimulated her to an exertion of all her power of pleasing. In the gorgeousness of her beauty, charged with that electricity that thrills a man at the faintest touch, and with that magic that makes him spellbound bound at her approach, the girl had entered into combat with a nature sensuous enough to appreciate all her charms, pure enough to resist them, and sufficiently disciplined to guard against being taken by surprise. These struggles grew less frequent as their acquaintance progressed; Gradually Emma came to lay down her arms at Welland's approach, and in a simple trusting manner, to look lip to him for advice and guidance. This, however, was a dangerous proceeding. The young man fell into habits of familiarity that no man can enter into with a beautiful woman, and escape unharmed. Still, if his heart occasionally softened, there was no sign of it in his manner. Courtly, but cool and self-possessed, he always kept in view the line which divides friendship from feelings of a warmer nature. 
               The reaction of this behavior upon a nature like Emma's, could not but in time lead to maddening love, or to intense hatred. Slowly the fuel accumulated in her heart, but what passion would apply the flame to it, and at whose shrine it would burn, was a matter to be decided by circumstances. In the meanwhile, Emma thirsted more and more for the young man's society, and Reichenau delighted to observe this predilection, for it seemed to lead to the accomplishment of his wishes. As a matter of course, he never dreamt of objections on Welland's part. 
               Charles Goldman was about this time much occupied, in consequence of the troubles at the South. Mr. Goldman, after due consideration, had ordered his son to sell out his Northern stocks, settle up all his business in New York, and return home. The stocks had been sold, the business settled up, but Charles still, lingered, trying in vain to get some promise or engagement from Emma Reichenau. He saw, the increasing influence of Welland; he noted the favor with which Mr. Reichenau looked upon the latter's intimacy with his daughter, and he felt that it was necessary to take a decided step if he thought of ever making Emma his wife. So he posted off South, and pounced upon the family at Pineland, when his letters had led them to think that he would stay in New York all winter. One day was devoted to family affection, and then Charles, in an interview with his parents, gave an account of his business transactions. Mr. Sharp was present, as a matter of course. Everything proved, satisfactory. Then, as Mr. Goldman rose to break up the sitting, Charles requested him to tarry a little longer, and with considerable hesitation, said: 
               "I have" got to tell you something, and I had better make it short. I am in love with a young lady of New York, and I want your consent to marry her." 
               Both the parents looked at the handsome young man before, them. He was covered with blushes, his eyes were cast down, and his fingers were nervously playing with the objects on the table. There was a joyous softening in the eyes of the old people, for rosy visions of their own youth were recalled by his manner and looks. 
               "Have you already proposed?" asked Mr. Goldman. 
               "I have not. I waited for your consent." 
               "I need not ask whether the lady is suitable, Charles," said Mrs. Goldman. "You know our opinions on that point." 
               "She is beautiful as a queen, belongs to one of the nicest families in New York, and moves in the very best society." 
               "That is well," rejoined the mother. "Who is her father?" 
               "Mr. Reichenau," replied Charles, rather defiantly, "Reichenau & Co., of Memphis and New York." 
               The three others looked up with surprise. 
               "Yes," continued the young man, "I know what you mean. He is not of our persuasion, but that does not matter with me. If Antonia is to marry Tourtelotte, I might as well marry Miss Reichenau." 
               "I had hoped," said Mr. Goldman, sadly, "that in New York you might have found among those of our people, a young lady whom you would have delighted to call wife. I am sure you might, if you had only desired to do so." 
               "Father," replied Charles, "to love a girl is not an act of the will. I love Emma Reichenau, and if she will have me, I will marry her-with your blessing if I can, without, if I must." 
               "But Charley," said the mother, "I am sure there are many beautiful ladies of our faith in that large city; ladies as fair, as well educated, and of as fine a family as Miss Reichenau." 
               "There may be, mother," replied Charles, "but they do not seem so to my eyes. Besides," he added, with a frown, "I have not seen them. Most of the young ladies you refer to, I have found to be illbred, tainted by the pecuniary difficulties that overshadowed their childhood, or by the coarse disposition of their parents. Their acquaintance with the actual worth of money, and the operations of commerce have blighted their finer sensibilities, and I could not endure a wife, who, when I gave her a bracelet, would esteem my love to be equal to five hundred dollars, and when I presented her with a bouquet of camelias, to be equal to ten. The worth of the purse so overshadows one in the estimation of these ladies, that the husband is a secondary consideration. I want a wife who has been raised in circumstances of such affluence, or whose soul has been so above the power of circumstances, that money is an article that does not enter into her calculations of life." 
               "You are are a fool," said Sharp. "I will not listen any longer to such nonsense. A man can fall in love with any woman, if he only tries, and the more a woman knows of money, the better for the household, especially with such a husband as you." 
               "But Charles," said Mr. Goldman, "what will become of the family, and what will your aunt say? Sarah, my love, speak to the boy." 
               "Goldman, my life," said the mother, "what can I say to him? Charley has been raised with aristocratic ideas, and I always told you he would not find a suitable wife of our persuasion in the United States." 
               "Very true, Sarah, my life; but you never forgot to say how disadvantageous to our position in this county a foreign wife of Charley's would be." 
               "What is to be done now?" asked Mrs. Goldman. 
               "What is to be done?" cried Sharp. "Let the boy come to reason, and give up his foolish schemes." 
               "You wouldn't make me miserable?" said Charles, turning his sea-blue eyes up to Sharp, and seizing one of the old man's hands. 
               "Miserable, you foolish child! No; but if you leave your faith, I'll have nothing more to do with you." 
               "Now I've got you," said Charles. "I am Jew enough to know that no positive interdiction exists against marriage with Gentiles. I needn't leave my faith, nor even break any positive command of it." 
               "Do you like her much? And does she like you well enough too?" asked Sharp, crossly. 
               "I love her beyond every thing. But I don't know whether she likes me." 
               "How can she help it," said Mrs. Goldman fondly, stroking Charles' hair. 
               But Sharp drew a long breath. 
               "It is not as bad as I thought," he said. "I don't believe the girl will have him if she knows that he is not of her religion. I would advise, that we give way to the boy and let him propose, if he promise to communicate this fact to the lady." 
               Charles winced. 
               Mr. Goldman now said: 
               "Charles, it is a different thing to marry your daughter to a Gentile, from letting your son take a Christian wife. The son is the upholder of the family name, and his wife determines the religion of her children. But if the lady in question love you, I doubt not that she will assume your faith. What will a woman not do for the sake of the man she loves? Then, if your affection for her be so strong, go and ask her to be your wife. What do you say, Sarah my love?" 
               "Goldman, my life," replied the lady, "I know the boy. It is of no use opposing him. If the lady is what he says in every other respect, let us hope, that for Charley's sake, she may assume our faith. Otherwise, my aunt will never consent." 
               "If you consent, what do I care for aunt Outon?" 
                
               "Aunt has a million of francs, Charley." 
               "Which I hope she will keep for many years yet. Thanks to you for your kindness and love; thanks to all. to feel that I have grieved you, but I love Emma with all my heart. Forgive me dear parents, and you dear friend, but I'll bring you home a daughter that will be my best apology. To-morrow I start for New York." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVI. 
               THE parlors of the Reichenau mansion presented a genial picture on a cold winter day. In addition to the furnace, which diffused its warmth throughout the house, Mr. Reichenau insisted on having a fire in the grates. And, in truth, there is no pleasanter ornament to a room than a merry blaze; it gives that air of home comfort which attaches itself to the old English expression of hearth. We may rejoice in furnaces, but don't let us dispense altogether with grates. 
               Aunt Margaret and Emma were entertaining two visitors. Mrs. DeWolf and her daughter belonged to the fashionables of the city. There was little known to society of their former history; but for the past ten years they had been wealthy and fashionable, and ten years in New York is an age beyond which historical researches do not extend. So they claimed a position among the creme of Fifth, and a recognition from that of Madison Avenue. Mrs. De Wolf was a short, stout lady, with no end of pretensions. Her eyes stared haughtily over the bold bridge of her Roman nose, and her chin was carried considerably in advance of the rest of her head. Like the princes and noblemen of the ancien regime, she graduated her salutations according to the rank of the person, or the degree of favor she happened to regard him with. Thus: one finger to a stranger, or an humble person: two, to a friend or equal; three, to a person of higher rank, or to one in extraordinary favor. Her whole hand she was never known to have given to any body except to her husband on the wedding day. Her daughter, like her in features, was nevertheless very pretty, and beside being very clever, affected somewhat the sentimental. Both ladies were dressed with great elegance, and had been discussing the opera. 
               "My dear Miss Reichenau, every body was there. I was sorry to remark your absence. Madame M-- wore a short waist and powder on her hair, and all the house looked at her. I hate such fishing for notoriety. It is not my style." Thus spake Mrs. DeWolf. 
               "I regret not having been there," said Emma. "How was the music?" 
               "Charming," replied Miss DeWolf. "Brignoli looked beautiful. Isn't his moustache sweet?" 
               "I am sure I don't know," laughed aunt Margaret; "but his voice certainly is." 
               "What have you done with your Tennessee admirer, Miss Reichenau? He used to be in constant attendance at the Academy. I did not see him," said the elder lady, with a sharp look at Emma. 
               "Madam, I do not claim him as an admirer. I believe he has returned to his home. I heard so." 
               "Heard so? Bless me, have you quarreled?" 
               "About a very serious matter." 
               "Indeed? You know how much I am attached to you. Do tell me then what it was. Perhaps I can be of service." 
               "Perhaps you can. Our difference of opinion arose from the question whether the emperor of China wears his own hair or a wig. Can you help us to decide this matter?" 
               Mrs. DeWolf turned scarlet. "You will have your joke," she said, with forced calmness, and arranging her own false front with her gloved hand. "But I hope you have not lost your knight from Tennessee. All the town would talk of it. Now, I never allow Amanda to be escorted by young gentlemen in that exclusive manner." 
               "I know that I can trust Emma," remarked aunt Margaret, quietly. "Mr. Goldman was called away by the troubles in his State." 
                
               "Of course," chimed in Mrs. DeWolf. "I was just teasing the dear girl." 
               The door opened, and admitted Mr. B-- the celebrated painter. He was greeted with great cordiality by all. The elder DeWolf majestically extended one finger to him. 
               "What a love your latest picture is! You must have seen angels to paint such a countenance," said Emma. 
               "Where the daughters of men possess so much beauty, it is not necessary to ascend to heaven for models," replied the painter, gallantly. 
               "I looked at your picture for over an hour," observed Miss DeWolf, "and I think it is beautiful. Do you believe that it is possible to dress the hair in that fashion, and make it stay?" 
               "I don't know," replied B--; "better try. Have you received your Beethoven bust, Miss Reichenau." 
               "Yes, It is in the corner behind you." 
               All turned and looked at the magnificent face of the great maestro. Finally Mrs. DeWolf said: 
               "What a head of hair!" 
               Emma burst into an irrepressible fit of laughter, from which she only recovered to say: 
               "But it is not combed smooth." 
               The ladies had arisen to take their departure, when the door opened once more, and Charles Goldman entered. He was dressed exquisitely. His eyes shone with brilliant and eager light, his golden hair floated back from a forehead white as snow, and cheeks that were tinged with crimson, and lips red as coral, contrasted finely with the sunny hue of his moustache. All welcomed him with great warmth, and upon Emma's countenance, a responsive blush appeared for a moment, and then left her pale and calm. Mrs. DeWolf extended three fingers to the young man, and invited him with great cordiality to come and see them. Amanda, her daughter, turned up her pretty eyes like a duck in a thunderstorm, and hoped that they would not miss him at the opera to-night. She could never understand the music, without his being there to explain the meaning. 
               "And my dear Mr. Goldman," added the mother, "we are in such a fright about the Southern news. You have just come from Tennessee. Do call, and give us the truth of all these horrid rumors. We shall all be so happy to see you." 
               And then the adieux were given, and numerous assurances of affection, and promises to call were exchanged between the ladies. 
               The carriage came up, and the DeWolfs went to circulate among their numerous friends, with unremitting assiduity, the news of Emma Reichenau's desertion by the wealthy Tennesseean, and of his sudden return. 
               Mr. --, the artist, staid quite; a while yet, and entered into an elaborate discussion sion of the pre-Raffaelite, the fond d'or, and a number of other styles of art. Emma listened with a great show of interest, and occasionally took part in the discussion, and prolonged it by modest questions. This brought the painter out more and more, while it drove the impartial Charles Goldman to the verge of insanity. To add to his irritation, aunt Margaret, who perceived it, in mistaken kindness plied him with questions about his journey, and endeavored to amuse him in her quiet and amiable way. The necessity of framing insipid replies to commonplace queries, at a time when the heart is bursting and the brain on fire, is the most exquisite torture that can be applied to human being. At such a time the old savage nature stirs in us, and we are tempted to seize any handy object and knock down the amiable and friendly individual, that is unconsciously putting us to the rack. Emma did not fail to perceive what was passing in Charles' mind, and she occasionally calmed his storm of impatience by a slyly demure look, and a mischievous question regarding Perugino or some other of the old masters. At last Mr. B-- arose, and with many excuses for his premature departure, and abandonment of the Interesting subject they had been discussing, said that, though his time was limited just then, he would be happy to return at an early day, and continue the conversation. Emma thanked him, and hoped that he would not forget his promise. When he had gone, aunt Margaret excused herself, and Charles drew a long breath and said: 
               "I admire your patience." 
               "Say rather my newly awakened interest in art," replied Emma. 
               "Oh, is that it? Then we many expect to see you handle a brush and palette in time." 
               "Yes; and the first picture I shall paint will be that of a young man hopelessly wincing under the infliction of an art lecture." 
               "Do you think I'd make a good model?" 
               "Excellent for that situation," replied Emma, laughing. "If you could only have studied your face while Mr. B-- was speaking!" 
               "Oh, I was a very lamb of patience while he waded through the art history of the Christian era! But when the Greeks and Romans came in for their turn, it was more than I could bear. I verily believe, that if he had spoken ten minutes longer I must have knocked him down or exploded. There are limits to every man's endurance." 
               "I see that you have fallen into Tennessee manners. You have become very savage in temper. In future I shall be afraid to contradict you, for fear of a knock down or an explosion." 
               "And I shall make it the chief object of my life not to deserve a contradiction from 
                  you," replied Charles, in an earnest, though somewhat timid voice. 
               A flash from her magnificent eyes almost dazzled him. In a voice of polite mockery, she said: 
               "The chief object of your life? What a 'vaulting ambition' you seem to possess. I wouldn't have a friend who dared not to contradict me. It would be a dreadful bore. Contradiction is the very spice of life." 
               "Life is very endurable without that spice," replied Charles. "But don't let us converse on abstractions. I have hurried down to Tennessee and back again with but one purpose, one aim." 
               "And now you want me ask what that was? I shall do no such thing, Mr. Goldman, especially as you have grown so serious." 
               "Can you not divine? Does not your heart tell you?" 
               "What a strange supposition! No! I do not understand the language of the heart. But if you insist upon my asking what have you gone to Tennessee for? Tell me." There was a blush on her face. 
               "To tell my parents that my heart was full of the divinest creature that walks the earth! To ask them for permission to make her my own Emma," he cried, seizing her hands, "dear Emma, will you be my wife? You must know, you must have perceived what my feelings were. For months past I have only lived in the radiance ance of your beauty, and oh, Emma! let me hope that I may continue to do so all my life." 
               He stood before her with his handsome face expressing the very agony of entreaty. He held her soft pretty hands in his own, and pressed them with the strength of overwhelming passion. His eyes hung on her features, and endeavored to catch an encouraging look. But Emma remained quietly seated on her chair, and though her face beamed with gratified pride, and perhaps with something more, she kept her eyes fixed dreamily upon the fire, and answered not. She answered not by look, or word. She seemed to be listening to pleasant music that came from afar. 
               "Emma," cried Charles at last, "have you no answer for me?" 
               Then she looked up, and said: 
               "I hardly know what to answer. I can not understand your feelings. I like you very well, but I don't think that I want to marry you. Yet, I don't know. Why must we speak of this subject? Let us drop it." 
               "Great God! Emma, have some pity in your heart!" 
               "I don't think I have much of a heart. I don't believe that I love you. I have always thought of my future husband as a strong character, with a will more powerful than my own, compelling me to bow down and tremble before him. It may be a romantic idea, and a foolish one. But I believe that the race of heroes is not extinct; and I am waiting for my ideal, who will not entreat me to marry him, but will proudly compel me to be his wife. If such a strong, proud character bore me off by force, and compelled me to marry him, I would love him all the more for it. This has been my fancy, Mr. Goldman. So, let me wait for my hero, and do you look for a sweet, gentle maid, who will make you a better wife than the wild and extravagant Emma Reichenau.-Ah! here is Mr. Welland!" and she sprang up, with a lively glow on her face, and the most animating smile it was possible to imagine. "I am so glad!" 
               "So that is your hero!" cried Charles, madly. 
               "And if it were?" she returned, proudly. 
               "Farewell! May God bless you!" And, without another word, he hastened out, past Welland, who was just being admitted by the front door. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVII. 
               WELLAND paused for a moment, and gazed after the agitated youth, who, without a sign of recognition, hurried past him, sprang down the steps, and walked quickly along the street. He had not proceeded far however, before he suddenly stopped, and reeled as if grown dizzy, and about to fall. Welland hastened to his side, and proffered assistance. But Charles drew back as if stung by a reptile, and surveying the other with an expression of fierce hatred, cried: "Sir?!" 
               It was but one syllable, but it spoke volumes. Nor did Welland reply to it otherwise than by a glance of astonishment, and a bow. In great perplexity he mounted the steps of the Reichenau mansion, and re-entered. Emma was in the parlor, her face buried in her hands. She was crying softly. 
               "Excuse me," said Welland. "I have come at an inopportune moment." And he prepared to retreat. 
               "Do not go," said Emma, in a voice of peculiar softness. "I am glad that you came." 
               "You seem to be agitated. Can I play, while you compose yourself?" 
               "Please do." 
               He sat down at the piano, and sounded a number of soft accords. Then gently hummed that exquisite song by Dickens, "The Ivy Green:" 
                      
                        "Creeping; creeping; creeping where no life is seen, 
                        Oh, a rare old plant is the ivy green!" 
                     
                  
                
               Presently he stopped, and asked: "Have you enough?" 
               "Please sing another," said Emma. 
               So he sang Kingsley's three Fishers. Strangely and solemnly sounded the refrain: 
                      
                        "Men must work, while women must weep, 
                        For there's little to earn, and many to keep. 
                        And the harbor bar keeps moaning-- 
                     
                  
                
                
               It had the effect of withdrawing her attention from herself. When the line: 
                     The sooner 'tis over, the sooner to sleep,"
                   came, she laid her hand lightly on Welland's shoulder. He stopped, and looked up. 
               "Have you met Charles Goldman," she asked. 
               "As I came in. He seemed in a strange state of mind." 
               "Yes. He has asked me to marry him." 
               "And you?" he inquired, turning upon the piano stool. 
               "Have refused," she replied, still resting her hand upon his shoulder. 
               "Pardon me. I found you in tears. Do you regret your decision?-I have no right to ask, it is true." 
               "I am glad you do ask," and she cast down her eyes. 
               "Shall I recall Mr. Goldman then?" 
               "Louis Welland!" and she flashed those glorious orbs full upon him, "I do not regret my decision, nor ever shall. It is true that I was somewhat attached to Charles Goldman last summer, and almost fancied I loved him. But he is too gentle, too mild, far too tame to become my lord and master. I shall never marry to possess a slave in my husband; I want a superior to look up to. Don't you think I am right?" 
               "Miss Emma," said Welland, "this is a delicate question, and I prefer not to discuss it, highly honored as I am by your confidence." 
                
               It needed all his self-command to preserve the calmness of his countenance, and the coolness of his speech. Under the pressure of her little hand, he was inclined to shake and tremble like an oak in an earthquake. His blood coursed through his veins like streams of burning lava, and he seemed floating in that peculiar electric atmosphere, which emanated from Emma. 
               "You are trying to evade me. Why, think you, I confide in you thus?" 
               "I ask myself, and find no answer." 
               "None?" and her voice quivered strangely. 
               "What in the world do you mean?" cried Welland, as he rose suddenly, and walked to the window. He was in a whirl of intoxicating sensations, and felt that in another moment he would be lost. 
               "I mean that you are the only man I have ever met, whose censure I fear, whose praise I covet. And yet, strange to say, while every one admired or blamed me, you have never given me either censure or praise." 
               "Nor ever shall. Censure implies a right which I dare not aspire to, praise a relation, which does not exist between us." 
               "A man like you dare aspire to any thing." 
               "Not so. Reason must regulate our aspirations." 
               "You do not understand me, or you will not." 
                
               She sat down, and pensively rested her head on her hand. Then glancing up, spoke softly, almost in a whisper: 
               "I have said very much this afternoon, and I looked for a response of a different sort." 
               Welland still preserved silence; he examined some hyacinths in the window, and seemed not to have heard the last remark. But when he looked up, and perceived that an answer was expected, he asked quietly: 
               "Miss Reichenau, have you observed these flowers?" 
               "Yes. They seem to interest you very much just now," she replied, with irony. 
               "They do. Look at this purple blossom, and the white one at its side. They incline toward each other, and seem ready to embrace in their fond approach. Do you think that if a gorgeous rose were placed at the other side of this purple hyacinth, it would desert its white blossom and bend over toward the rose?" 
               "I do not understand floriculture, or the inclination of flowers," she said, coldly, yet with some attention. 
               "It would not. It assumes a certain position, and can not be turned, unless pulled up by the roots. Do you know why it turns this way?" 
               "I have told you that I understand nothing of the matter. Nevertheless, I thank you for your lesson in botany." 
               "It turns thus, just as the human heart conceives certain affections-no one knows why, no sage can explain the working of these things. They are-that is all we know. And now," he continued, approaching her, "will you grant me an hour of confidence at your own time? Some day when your nerves are quiet. I have much to say to you. Do not refuse me this favor." 
               "For what purpose? Don't ask me." 
               "Permit me to persist. At your own time." 
               "I promise. I will let you know when. Haven't I talked much nonsense this afternoon?" 
               "I am not able to judge. My mind is so pre-occupied with business matters to-day, that I must plead guilty to great inattention. Do not forget your promise. Good day." And he took his departure. 
               Emma remained standing on the same spot, and in the same attitude, until she heard a step approach. Then softly creeping up-stairs to her own room, she murmured drearily and wearily: 
               "Rejected!" 
               Hours passed. She answered the summons to dinner by pretending a nervous headache. On the same plea she refused to see any one. Her grief was her sole companion. 
               It was the first blow her young heart had received, the first rebuff her hopes had met. She could scarce realize that it was possible. A man, who had remained silent lent toward her, because, as she imagined, he feared that the difference of station, and social position, and wealth would preclude all hopes of a union, had rejected her, when she approached him with extended arms. He did not love her. And she had almost asked for his love. He would not marry her. And she had almost asked him. It was such a puzzle, that she could not find her way out. Only this was clear, that they must be strangers to each other for ever after, it they would not be enemies. 
               And Charles Goldman. How wantonly had she rejected his piteous appeal! She called up his glance of entreaty, she saw this fair face trembling with excitement, his sea-blue eyes so earnest in their gaze, his bright, sunny hair. And he was gone. Sent away with a bitter sorrow in his heart, even as she now lay here, nursing her own bruised feelings. Was he indifferent to her? She could not tell. Welland had appeared to her like a hero of romance, and his seeming indifference had first roused the, wish to make a conquest of him. This had proved dangerous. She had been forced to capitulate, and the enemy had even disdained to hold her a prisoner. 
               She slept soundly, after all; but next morning, she felt that she had grown older. Her first illusion had been dispelled, the first idol of her heart had been taken from her. It is this which makes the spirit old. Young it remains for all the years, if allowed to retain the dreams and illusions of youth. Old it turns for all the youth, if these are dispelled. Thank God, for the eternal power of rejuvenating he has implanted in the human heart. 
               And Welland. He was sorely puzzled. He had not dreamt of this. After all, it was very flattering that a girl so beautiful, wealthy and proud, should be carried away to such an extent by her passion for him. It was a sort of flattery which few men are able to resist. The more he pondered, the softer grew his heart. What a magnificent beauty she was! How completely she threw away all reserve, all hesitation, to ask him for his love. With what delight would her father have hailed a consummation of this kind. To judge from some of his hints he even anticipated it. It was almost a pity, that it could not be. So loving and beautiful a girl; so kind and prepossessed a father; a position of such advantage. It was a pity. Fate plays with men at cross purposes. The best chances occur, when one can not take advantage of them. 
               Thus ran Welland's thoughts. Thus would any man's thoughts have run, after what had occurred. He could not help contrasting the brilliancy of his fortunes, the general consent and contentment, the absence of trouble, in case he married Emma Reichenau, with the long years of waiting, the heart-burnings, and the family opposition which his engagement with Antonia entailed upon him. After acting properly, and remaining faithful to his principles and promises, no man could have denied himself the small satisfaction of making reflections like these. 
               But his love for Antonia only burned the brighter at last. She was the chosen one of his heart, and after permitting his thoughts to carry him away for a little while, they only returned to her with double strength. And with thoughts of Antonia, came also thoughts of her brother. Anxious to clear up their mutual misunderstandings, he hastened to the Fifth Avenue hotel, and sent up his card. It was returned with a "Not at home," which thus put an effectual bar to all endeavors at explanation. 
               In a weary and rather discontented state of mind, in short, in that state which the English have termed "the blues," Welland strolled about this evening. Suddenly a hand was extended to him, and a voice asked: 
               "How do you do? How is friend Goldman?" 
               It was Merrins, dressed in the extreme of fashion, and looking more dissipated than ever. At such times one is glad of any companionship, and Welland returned the greeting with cordiality. 
               "Where are you going? Particular business?" asked Merrins. 
               "No; quite at your service. Have you planned out your evening?" 
                
               "Never do. Makes one a slave to one's own resolves." 
               "Well then, let us go and drink a bottle of wine. I have got the blues, I think." 
               "Lost money? Only thing gives me the blues." 
               "No. Nothing of that sort," replied Welland, smiling. 
               They were soon seated in the cozy nook of a wine-house, in the lower part of the city. 
               "If it isn't money gave you the blues," remarked Merrins, "'tis woman." 
               "You may be right," answered Welland. "You seem to be experienced." 
               "Haven't lived all my life in New York for nothing. But I treat them philosophically." 
               "You surprise me. I didn't know that the subject was capable of such treatment. Philosophy and women!" 
               "Have been three times on the point of proposing during the last week. Have each time gone to the house of the lady, with the firm intention of asking her to be my wife. Something occurred. A trifle, perhaps, disturbed me. A little over eagerness on her part. Show of consciousness of my purpose on part of the mother. Or some such thing. Have gone away each time without committing myself. And have always felt happy over it afterward. A sort of thankfulness for being still at liberty. Aint it queer?" 
               "Don't you like the lady?" 
                
               "Yes. I like her; a kind of," replied Merrins, reflectingly. "Figure's good, teeth pretty sound, cheeks nicely red, and plenty of black hair. Dresses gorgeously, and wears five thousand dollar's worth of diamonds at least. Educated too-plays, piano by the hour. Don't you know her? Krakowwitzer & Co, Gents' Clothing and Furnishing Goods, Chatham street." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVIII. 
               IT was a brilliant evening at the Academy of Music. The season was almost over, and every body seemed anxious to listen once to the magnificent voices, that had delighted the New York public during the winter. The boxes were crowded. Every variety of opera costume was on exhibition. The most delicate and the most vivid colors vied for the mastery, and diamonds sparkled in magnificent profusion on necks and arms of marble whiteness. 
               Presently Muzio appeared, and waved his baton. The overture began. Every body settled himself comfortably in his chair, and the ladies commenced to scrutinize each other's toilets, with the aid of pearl-mounted glasses. 
               In one of the boxes sat Emma Reichenau and her father. Not far behind them was Welland. He had kept up his friendly relations with the family. But they extended now, to the old gentleman, mainly. Thus far had he and Emma found the necessity of sacrificing to appearances. But beyond this, their intercourse though friendly was cold and formal, and their conversation made up of platitudes and common-places. Emma was more serious than when we saw her last. The two months, which had passed between her momentous interview with Welland and the present moment, had changed the girl into a woman. With the same proud forehead, and the same dazzling beauty an air of reserve, and a certain coldness had come over her, which chilled the beholder. 
               The curtain rose, and the introductory chorus was given. The opera was Verdi's Trovatore, Sweet Isabella Hinckley, whose voice now rises in the choir of angels, sang the part of Leonora. Every eye rested upon her lovely form, every ear was inclined to her melodious tones. She retired, and Brignoli, with a voice breathing the sweetness of Italian springs, chanted the serenade. At that moment Emma became sensible of a pair of eyes gazing at her. Every one has felt the sensation. Every one has experienced this peculiar thrill. She languidly lifted her own, and saw Charles Goldman, directly opposite, with a thin wan face, from which his sea-blue eyes, larger and brighter than ordinarily, stared at her. She felt a shudder pass over her, and half turned to Welland, to interrogate him with a glance. 
               "I have seen him," he replied. 
                
               "What keeps him in New York?" she asked drearily. "His presence makes me uncomfortable." 
               "I have heard but little of him," said Welland. "He has abandoned his old haunts, and seems to live without a purpose." 
               "Do you not see him now and then?" 
               "Never now-a-days. He--" 
               "Silence," whispered Mr. Reichenau. "Listen to the trio." 
               The first act was over. People took their ease. 
               Welland bent down to Emma, and began: 
               "You have promised me an hour of confidence. I did not wish to remind you of it. But now I request you to appoint the time." 
               Emma raised her eyes and threw a piercing glance at him. But he met it calmly and gently. 
               "I shall be engaged every afternoon this week," she said. Then playing nervously with her fan, added: "I am afraid of your confidence Mr. Welland." 
               "Then I withdraw my request," he replied bowing. 
               "No. Come on Friday afternoon at two o'clock. I shall expect you." 
               The overture began, and the curtain rose on the Anvil Chorus. 
               In the meanwhile Charles Goldman, who had after the first act risen, and strolled around the house, was picked up by the De Wolfs. 
               "Do come here my dear Mr. Goldman," cried the mother, extending three gloved fingers to him, "and tell us all about this music. You do it so charmingly." 
               Charles approached with a flush of feverish excitement on his cheek. 
               "I should be happy to do so," he said, "did I not know that Miss DeWolf understands it much better than I." 
               "You are are satirical," said the young lady. "Tell us then, you wicked man, why you have broken all your promises, and never called? Confess that you had forgotten all about it. Guilty or not guilty?" 
               "Guilty and repentant. Where such fair eyes sit in judgment, the sentence must be merciful." 
               "Must be? 
                      
                        "The quality of mercy is not constrained, 
                        But droppeth as a gentle dew from heaven-' 
                     
                   Am I misquoting?" 
               "I believe you are. What is to be my sentence?" 
               "I must reflect on the case. Come back after the next act and inquire again. Dr. Solta, how do you do?" and she bowed to a young Italian doctor, to whom Mrs. De Wolf extended two fingers with great dignity. 
               "Permit me to introduce Signor Casabella, an artist, whose pictures are making him celebrated," said the doctor, producing a noble looking youth. 
                
               Another bow on part of Miss, and one finger on part of Mrs. DeWolf. 
               "It is always advantageous for the painter to be acquainted with ladies whose speaking features are sure to suggest ideas to him," said the artist, with Italian gallantry. 
               Charles passed on. He was greeted with many a bright smile from ladies more or less fair, and with many a coquettish wave of the fan. He bowed here, and smiled there, but restlessly continued to move. 
               "Why Charley, how are you?" 
               It was young Armistead from Claiborne County, a friend and schoolmate. 
               "What in the world brings you to New York?" inquired Charles, after the exchange of hearty salutations. 
               "I can't tell you just now. Let us wait until this act is over, and then go." 
               When the curtain had fallen, they left the house, and adjourned to a room in a celebrated restaurant. Over a bottle of wine they talked of home reminiscences. 
               "You wouldn't know the old county," said Armistead at last. "Every man has the war fever. They never meet now, but to drill and study tactics, and the ladies are embroidering flags, and getting ready lint and bandages all the time." 
               "Then things must have changed much of late," replied Charles. "Why, none of you contemplate seriously the beginning of a civil war? This is all mere fuss to frighten the North!" 
                
               "Mere fuss!" cried Armistead. "The North will not find it so. I tell you Charles, there will be war! Had you not been from home so long, you would not doubt it for a moment. Every old sword and gun in the county has been fished out and furnished up, and our people are drilling with an enthusiasm and a perseverance that speaks for the strength of their opinions." 
               "Well, you know Harry, there has always been more feeling on these subjects in the border States. I don't think the great Southern States will join in any movement of the sort. Their prosperity depends too much on peace." 
               "They will sacrifice their prosperity and their very life ere they give up this cause! You have received your opinions from Northern sources. The North wont believe us, often as we have re-iterated our threats. They wont believe us until we thunder at their gates." 
               "Pshaw! leave bombast at home. Can it really be so serious as you represent?" 
               "Charley, I swear to you it is bloody earnest this time! What do you think I have come to New York for?" 
               "To see the sights. To enjoy yourself." 
               Armistead rose, and neared his lips to Charles's ear: 
               "I have come to purchase arms for our people!" 
               The other leaped up in great surprise: 
               "Has it come to this?" he said. "Are you already preparing to take the field with a military force?" 
               "I have come to purchase arms for the officers and men of our battalion. We are all organized, and await but the word." 
               "All of Claiborne County?" 
               "No. The adjoining counties have united with us, and our part of the State will not furnish the worst troops, I warrant you." 
               Charles hung his head reflectively. 
               "And now," resumed the other, "let me ask you, what keeps you in New York. I am taking an unwarrantable right perhaps, but my friendship for you will justify it." 
               "I can't tell you Harry. I wish I could." 
               "Is it business? You needn't define of what sort." 
               "No." 
               "Is it mere pleasure then? Tell me." 
               "Pleasure!" and Charles smiled sadly. 
               "No!" 
               "You don't look as if it were. You are not dissipating then?" 
               "Harry!" 
               "I beg your pardon. But I must ask further." 
               "It's of no use, I can't tell you." 
               "Is it a woman? Charles, is it a woman?" 
               "I can't tell you Henry." 
               There was a pause. Then Armistead moved his chair around, and laid his hand on Goldman's shoulder. 
               "But I can tell you, Charles, that you must go home. You look sick. Your face is thin and sallow, your eyes look like those of a man who has been unfortunate. I don't know what has happened to you, but I know if you stay here, you will fall a victim to dissipation or melancholy." 
               "In other words, I will be a drunkard or idiot!" said Charles angrily. "But," he continued after a while, "you may be right, Harry." 
               "There is another reason." 
               "Well, speak on," replied Charles wearily, as the other stopped. "Don't you see it, yourself?" 
               "Oh, for heaven's sake, don't put me to the trouble of thinking. What is it?" 
               "Because you are one of us, and your place is in our ranks! Every thing that the North has done to us, it has done to you. Charles, you were born in the South, you live there, and by God, you must fight for the South." 
               "I don't see it quite so." 
               "If our slaves are freed, your's will be all the same." 
               "I don't care." 
               "That may be so. You can free them yourself, if you choose. But you can't surrender the privileges of your country, or see it attacked and stand calmly by." 
               "I can't help feeling an inclination to do as you say." 
               "For God's sake, give way to it. You are living a purposeless life here. Come away with me, come home!" 
                
               "And then?" 
               "Do your duty like a man! Who doesn't stand by the South in this fight will be branded as a coward and traitor all his life. Charley, I'd rather out off my right hand than deny its service to my country, when she demands it, right or wrong!" 
               "That's queer doctrine!" 
               "It's the only doctrine to work by. Sink your individual opinion in the desires of the nation, and work for the good of the whole. Pledge me, Charley, in a glass of champagne." And he touched the bell. 
               A waiter appeared. 
               "Champagne. Bring it at once, and put ice in the glasses." 
               In a few moments the goblets were full of the foaming beverage. 
               "Now clink glasses," cried Armistead. 
               They did so, and a bell-like sound marked the contact. 
               "The South, right or wrong!" said Harry. 
               "The South, right or wrong!" replied Charles. 
               They finished their glasses at a draught, and shook hands on it. 
               "When do you return?" inquired Charles. 
               "Day after to-morrow. As soon as I have shipped my wares," replied Harry. "And now let us return to the Academy. It will be long ere I again will hear an opera there, unless we should take New York by storm. Will you accompany me?" 
                
               "Yes-now to the Academy, and day after to-morrow to Tennessee." 
               So they re-entered the Opera House. The curtain had just risen upon the fourth act. Miss Hinckley was singing on the darkened stage Leonora's song of passion and tender despair, in front of Manrico's prison. With tremulous sorrow she sounded the expiring notes, and immediately, melting together with her last thrill, rose Brignoli's voice, sweet as a nightingale's, in that marvelous prison song, which is one of Verdi's chef d'oevres. The audience was spell-bound. Every eye was riveted on the stage but one. 
               Charles Goldman looked at Emma. The song had entered his soul. That melancholy Addio Leonora, so tender and so full of sadness, expressed the griefs, and yearnings, and passions of her own heart. His eyes grew moist, and when by chance Emma, whose feelings had also been stirred by the character of the music, glanced up and saw him, he kissed the tips of his fingers with passionate emotion. She blushed and bowed her head. 
               "Let us go," said Charles, pulling Armistead's sleeve. 
               "Not now. The opera is almost over. Wait." 
               So they waited. And then Charles was complaisant enough to linger in the foyer, and give his friend an opportunity of beholding the fashion of New York. 
               On they came, in silks and satins, with flowers in their hair and fans in their hands, with silliness and folly in their heads, those leaders of the bon ton, and their obedient followers. It was a splendid show, and delighted the heart of the young Tennesseean. Presently the De Wolfs passed. 
               "Where is the delinquent?" said the young lady, smiling. "Give bail for your appearance." 
               "Forgive me," replied Charles. "And let me ask you to put off my trial for a long time, since I must return South day after to-morrow." 
               "Return South? Spring is almost here, when the birds come back from there. Must you go?" 
               "I must, for danger threatens my nest. Good bye." 
               They passed on, and Armistead made the gallant remark: 
               "Deuced pretty girl, Charles. Was she the cause?" 
               "No, Harry. 'Tis no use guessing. Better give it up." 
               Presently came another division of the crowd, and then the Reichenaus. Emma attended by her father, was almost face to face with Charles. Harry Armistead felt his friend's arm shake and tremble as with the palsy. He grew pale, and leant against the wall for support. Emma gazed at him sadly, and half inclined her head, while Mr. Reichenau bowed. Charles returned the salutation with constraint. When they were gone, a lace handkerchief lay on the floor upon which Charles pounced, and then followed his friend into the street. 
               Harry Armistead did not put any more questions. He had found the cause. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIX. 
               CHARLES GOLDMAN returned home, and engaged in military pursuits, with an eagerness that betokened great devotion to the cause, or a feverish desire to escape the plaints of memory. In a battalion of cavalry, which Tourtelotte commanded, he soon distinguished himself sufficiently to be elected to a subaltern's place. And, in truth, he was indefatigable. Mr. and Mrs. Goldman remonstrated with him on the excess of his zeal. But Madame la Generale took pride in it. When the mother spoke of her fears, and hoped that active hostilities would not take place, Madame shook her beer-barrel curls energetically, and replied: 
               "I know better. There will be war." 
               "It is impossible to say so. These things have been before," replied Mrs. Goldman. 
               "Pardon me, ma chere. I can scent a revolution from afar." 
               "If it comes to battles," said the anxious mother, "my son must stay at home. I will not suffer him to be shot at." 
               "You can not prevent it, Sarah," replied Madame. "The boy is brave and will go. C'est le sang de mon pere, le General." 
               "Perhaps money might arrange it," suggested the father. 
               Madame uttered a cry of indignation. "Charles would never consent. And I would spit in his face if he could." 
               "You wish to have my boy killed then, my beautiful boy," cried the mother, "since you encourage these ideas?" 
               "I wish to have the honor of my family preserved," replied the old lady with great stateliness. "If every gentleman in the county fights, Charles must fight, and better than the rest, because of his great grandfather." 
               This silenced all but Mr. Sharp, who suggested that he might serve as quartermaster or cook, and so escape danger; urging that he had served in the latter capacity, and never been exposed. Where upon all the rest turned against him, and he was compelled to defend himself or fly. 
               In those days Tourtelotte was a frequent guest at Pineland. His connection with Charles was a plausible reason, though Antonia continued to treat him with a friendly kindness and openhearted consideration, that banished all hopes of a warmer feeling. Nevertheless he bided his time, and kept alive his hopes with the pertinacity of his nature. 
               Events were hastening to a crisis. An impulse was given to military activity, which foretold its approach. Drills and parades, the target shootings were of daily occurrence. And not only did these call the men out, but the ladies were regular spectators, and gave a greater degree of animation to the exercises, by the interest they manifested. Madame la Generale was a constant attendant, and Antonia appeared frequently on her gray pony; as much for the pleasure of Charles' escort home, as for witnessing the spectacle. 
               It was on one of these returns home. Charles, whose feverish energy had deserted him, walked his horse through the solemn pine wood, oblivious of Antonia. But the sister kept at his side, and watched him with an affectionate eye. Finally she broke silence: 
               "Brother of mine, there is a care on your mind. Do you grieve still-on account of that New York affair? Charles, confide in me, tell me every thing. Perhaps I can give you comfort." 
               The young man smiled sadly. "My own little Antonia, you don't understand any thing of such matters." 
               "You did not always think so," she rejoined gaily. "Do you remember how you consulted me about Miss Quailey, who was ten years older than yourself, and with whom you were desperately in love?' 
               "What has become of the old thing?" asked Charles, laughing. 
               "Married, my poor brother. And about Clara Peters, to whom you used to write verses?" 
                
               "Did I? I was a fool." 
               "No. You were only a boy, like all boys. And how you fought with Harry Armistead over Nelly Grant, with her red cheeks?" 
               "She is dead, aint she?" 
               "No, only dreadfully pious. Now, in those days I was your confidant, and I could give you advice and comfort. Wont you try me now, Charley?" 
               He hem'ed and haw'ed, and finally thought he would tell her, but only if she promised him true sympathy, and refrained from being satirical. 
               "You know I will," she said; but could not help adding: "Do you expect me to weep at the touching parts?" 
               "There! That's how you'll sympathize! And then you'll tell aunt, and she'll murder me with her French frivolities." 
               "Come Charley. Don't be so touchy. Here's a nice spot. Let the horses pick a litte grass, and we can talk." 
               Charles dismounted and let his horse graze. Antonia slackened the rein to give her pony an opportunity of doing the same. 
               She had chosen a beautiful corner of the woods. A small lawn, enclosed on every side by trees, already showed tufts of grass and herbage, notwithstanding the early season. Charles came to her side. Taking off his military cap, she gently stroked his sunny hair. For a while he was silent, and then, evidently speaking with an effort, said: 
               "She is very beautiful. I saw her first at Saratoga. It was at a grand ball, and some of the greatest men in the country were there. She wore a dress of brilliant red silk, and a crown of golden ears of wheat. Her magnificent black hair hung down upon her snowy shoulders, and her eyes blazed with almost royal haughtiness. On any one else this costume would have looked outre, but she is of such proud and dazzling beauty, that gorgeous colors seem but her appropriate raiment. I was perfectly bewitched. I got an introduction, and danced a quadrille. It seems as if I were walking on clouds. My heart was so elated, that I spoke and acted without consciousness of what I said or did. This intoxication continued for days. I lived but in her presence. The most delicate attentions it was possible to bestow, the most complete devotion any one can manifest, I lavished upon her. Happy that she accepted them. Glad that she tolerated me." 
               "Did she not respond in any way," inquired Antonia. 
               "I don't know. She seemed to like me, and to increase in confidence, as we got to know each other better. I was her cavalier in New York. Her aunt favored the connection. Still she did not manifest any decided preference. I mean that she showed me no more than what could be construed as warm friendship. But I am sure that I was working my way into her affections." 
               "And then?" asked Antonia. 
               "And then her father came. I was less fortunate in winning his good graces. He treated me with politeness, but not with the cordiality of friendship. Still, if Emma had accepted me, I do not think he would have refused his consent." 
               "Poor Charles! Was she so obdurate?" 
               "On the contrary. I felt that every day brought us into clever relations. I only hesitated on one account. I feared the effect of telling her that I was not a Christian." 
               "Ah, brother of mine, that's the consequence of sailing under false colors. You should have told her before you ever were so deeply involved." 
               "As if there was such a time! Don't I tell you that I was spell-bound from the moment I first beheld her?" 
               Antonia smiled, and continued to stroke his hair. But Charles had become moody, and remained silent. Finally the sister asked in her deep, gentle voice: 
               "And then?" 
               "And then her father came again, and brought some one with him. Both were leaving the South on account of the troubles. They had become acquainted on the journey, and the old man was soinfatuated as to invite this stranger to his house. What more can I tell you? He was a quiet fine-looking man, with an air of distinction tinction and romance, which captivated Emma. I saw it, I feared it. He did not seem to pay especial attentions to her, and yet she took him into favor more and more. I obtained the consent of our parents, and asked her to be my wife." 
               "And she refused you?" 
               "She refused me." 
               "Poor Charley." 
               "She talked about having a husband of a strong character, who would compel her to his will. And about her ideal of such, and all sorts of romantic fiddle-faddle. And I saw that I had no chance. Especially when she advised me to look for a gentle maiden, while she waited for her hero." 
               "That was too bad." 
               "And while I tried to bring her to reason, her father's friend came toward the house. She saw him, and broke off immediately, while manifesting the greatest joy at his approach. That told me how matters stood, and I left at once." 
               "Are they married?" 
               "No, not even engaged. But every body says they will be." 
               "And you love her still?" 
               "I shall always love her." 
               And then followed a great silence. At last Antonia, for the sake of saying something, asked: 
               "Is this favored suitor unworthy of her?" 
               "I don't know. I can't say any thing against him. But I believe that he marries Emma for her money." 
               "Ah! You say he has lived South?" 
               "Certainly. Didn't I tell you? In this county. I think, you must know him. He told me that he had been our guest, Mr. Welland." 
               Every shade of color left the young lady's cheeks. Her sea-blue eyes gave one agonized glance at Charles, and then stared far away into the distance, where the golden sun was preparing to set. Golden gleams fell on the tips of the pine branches, and swept across the little lawn, between bars of lengthened shadow. A few birds chirped their evening song, and for the rest, all was quiet. Charles buried in his reflections, and Antonia in her's. 
               In a voice, whose cold tremor made her brother raise his eyes, she inquired at last: 
               "Are you sure it is the same Mr. Welland, who was in this county? We all knew him well." 
               "Yes, I am pretty sure. He said so, and seemed to know the people. What did he do here? I forget." 
               "He was a State surveyor. Charley, I believe Mr. Welland is an honorable gentleman, and would scarce do what you impute to him. Are you sure there is no misunderstanding? I mean sure that the lady refused you because she preferred him, and that he encouraged that preference? Perhaps she only rejected your addresses because she didn't know her own mind, and Mr. Welland has nothing to do with it. You say they are not engaged." 
               "No. Not engaged as yet, I said." 
               "Nor may ever be. What if you should labor under a mistake, brother?" 
               "Antonia," cried Charles, in a ringing voice, "am I likely to make a mistake in such a matter? Oh I am but too sure of the truth of what I told you. Silly little sister, don't you know that I would give my right hand to be able to doubt it?" 
               Antonia answered not. The matter was but too plain. 
               "It is chilly," remarked Charles. "Let us get home." 
               The gray cold of evening settled down upon the earth. Every beam of light, every flake of gold had disappeared. The pines rustled mournfully, and the sad sigh of the breeze swept through the pillared aisles of the wood. 
               Suddenly Charles said: 
               "Walk your horse, Antonia. I've something else to tell you. I am sure that there will be a great and bloody war. I did not take much interest in political affairs at first, and would perhaps now be still pining in New York, and feeding on my disappointment, had not Harry Armistead roused me to action. As it is, I am glad to find an object which withdraws my thoughts from Emma. I will fight in this war with the best, not only because the interests of the State are at stake, and because honor requires me to do so, but also for another reason. I will show Emma that, though gentle and obedient with ladies, I have as much of the manly and daring element in me, as her mock hero. I will convince her that Charles Goldman was worthy of her love, though she choose Welland. And Antonia, if a soldier's shroud be my lot, think that I am happy and at peace, and comfort father and mother." 
               "Dear brother, my heart is heavy with grief." 
               "What, and all for poor Charley? Nay, you must spare some of that little heart for Colonel Tourtelotte. Did you know he had been commissioned?" 
               Antonia shook her head. 
               "We are brothers in arms, as we have been brothers in mind, and will be brothers in law, I hope," he said, and forced himself to smile archly. But seeing her distressed face, he stopped, and cried: "Nay, 'twas but fun." And then burst into the merry carol of a serenade: 
                      
                        "If heaven had tongues to speak, as well 
                        As starry eyes to see, 
                        What curious stories it would tell 
                        Of wandering youths like me! 
                     
                      
                        Did we but strive for heaven above, 
                        Half as much as we 
                        Strive day and night, for woman's love, 
                        What angels we should be!" 
                     
                  
                
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXX. 
               IT was the custom for Sharp and Antonia to have their confidences about Welland. Now and then a mail brought letters from him to the manager, and then there was reading and re-reading. To save the proprieties, they contained not a single word addressed directly to the young lady, except respectful regards at the end. But all the more was their sense addressed to her heart. And old Sharp was as glad as a butterfly, that bears the love tokens of one flower to the petals of the other. 
               On the day when Charles related the history of his suit to Antonia, Sharp received a letter from Welland. He waited impatiently for the young lady's return to entice her into his rooms, and communicate its contents. But before he could see her, she had retired. Plea, indisposition. When Mrs. Goldman appeared with tender inquiries, the mulatto girl was bathing her head with ether and water. So quiet and rest were recommended, and the night fell upon one more aching heart at Pineland. 
               Aching, but brave. Stricken, but well disciplined. A heart that fought out its battles, and when the combat was over buried its dead, put stones on their graves, and thought of them ever after with quiet sadness. When morning broke the fight was over. All that wild yearning, that craving love, and passionate admiration, all those burning sorrows had been laid and put way, while memory scattered over them the white rosebuds of a dead passion. With the golden lights, and the brisk freshness of coming day, Antonia arose, quiet and collected, but wan and sad. Though we prove victor in these combats, we suffer from our wounds for many days, and carry the cicatrices all our life. 
               Sharp met her with a smiling countenance. 
               "I have a letter from Mr. Welland," he said. 
               "And I also," replied Antonia, calmly, "have heard of him yesterday." 
               "Ah, has he written to you?" asked the old man, with surprise. 
               "No. Mr. Welland has too much savior vivre to indulge in a breach of propriety. Let us drop the subject, please." 
               "Drop the subject! Excuse me," he said, detaining her, "do you not wish to hear what he says?" 
               "I am not curious," she replied, trying to escape. 
               "But I do not understand you." 
               "Perhaps you will, when I tell you that Mr. Welland has proved unworthy of the confidence I foolishly bestowed upon him." 
               "It can not be. You are mistaken." 
               "Pardon me. We will never speak of this subject any more. I shall break off any conversation with you in which the name of Welland occurs. Remember, this subject is tabood between us." And she swept into the breakfast-room. 
                
               "I'll never believe it," said the old man, shaking his little head; "still I must try to fathom this change." 
               There was a gathering of ladies in Mrs. Waddlekin's house. All were deep in embroidery. On three enormous breadths of silk, various figures had been completed by busy fingers. A sheaf of wheat, a plow, and a schooner were most prominent, while the word "Agriculture" streamed across these in golden letters. It was the coat of arms of Tennessee, which they embroidered upon the flag to be presented to the-th regiment of cavalry. As a matter of course, tongues were not idle while fingers worked. 
               "What in the world detains Antonia Goldman!" cried the lady of the house, with some irritation. "We want her to do the gold work on this sheaf of wheat, and we can't well go on until that is finished." 
               "Perhaps the Colonel is explaining tactics to her," said Mrs. Smockley, maliciously. 
               "Which is much more proper than his explaining them to married ladies, in my opinion ma'am, if I may be so bold as to offer an opinion," returned Mrs. Waddlekins, to the general delight of all. For Tourtelotte had paid pointed attentions to the handsome and vulgar Mrs. Smockley, and every lady left slighted and scandalized thereat. 
               "I don't know what you refer to ma'am," returned the other. "I was not speaking of the Quartermaster." 
               This was a dig at Mrs. Waddlekins, in whose house Hassel, Quartermaster of the new regiment, lived. 
               "Let us drop the matter," urged Mrs. Oglethorpe. "Every body knows that the Colonel and Miss Goldman are as good as engaged. And therefore," she continued, after a while, "I think it would be best to have Antonia Goldman present the flag. What do you think, ladies?" 
               Thereupon a great discussion arose. 
               Mrs. Waddlekins stretched out her arm, in the usual orational manner, and said with immense dignity: 
               "Ladies, the presentation of this flag will be an event of no small importance in the history of our country. Don't think that it is a town, or a country affair, or even a State matter. It is an act that will be noticed in the furthest corners of the land, and in the most distant isles of the sea! Yea, in the most distant isles of the sounding sea!" 
               "Nobody says it wont," returned old Miss Quizzens, whom, after the manner of public speakers, Mrs. Waddlekins had fixed with her eye, and who therefore felt it incumbent on her to deny any disagreement with the assertion. 
               "Don't interrupt me, ma'am, if you please," said Mrs. Waddlekins, crushing the other with a majestic wave of the hand. "I feel the full importance of this act," she continued, laying her fingers upon her billowy bosom, "and therefore I submit to you ladies, whether it would not be better to choose a matron, whose family has historical associations with our great men, and whose ancestors have lived and died in Claiborne County, to present this flag to our valiant warriors? I ask you ladies, all of you?" and once more she fixed the unfortunate Miss Quizzens with her eye. 
               But Miss Quizzens was not to be tempted to her destruction again. She bore the glance, and closed her lips tightly. 
               As only Mrs. Waddlekins answered to the description given, every one felt that to oppose it would be to the signal for battle. So there was a deep pause. But the arch enemy slept not. Mrs. Smockley mustered her forces. 
               "If it must be a matron with all those historical thing-um-bobs," she said, innocently, "it can only be Mrs. Armistead." 
               "There are ladies in the county whose claims are of a prouder nature than Mrs. Armistead's," the old lady replied, bitterly. "But persons who talk about historical thing-um-bobs, can recognize no claims but those of the minions of fortune." 
               "Minions of what?" returned Mrs. Smockley. "What are minions?" 
               "Ma'am," cried Mrs. Waddlekins, "my conversation was not addressed to you." 
               "Have the goodness to hand me some cotton then, to stop my ears," retorted the other. "I shall be the better off." 
               "Ladies," said Miss Allen, "this wont do. Don't quarrel. I think, myself, it is the custom for a young lady to present a flag." 
               "Not at all," said Mrs. Waddlekins. "My grandfather often related how the General had told him, that Lady Washington presented a flag to one of the regiments. And in Baltimore there was a lady of seventy, embroidered and presented a flag to a militia company. Think of it ladies, this matter will be discussed in the newspapers. When our flag flaunts in the van of battle," and she raised her arm in the manner of Washington upon the picture, "the world will ask: Who presented it? And what will you answer?" She again gazed tauntingly at Miss Quizzens, but that cautious old damsel taking warning by her former fate, maintained an imperturbable silence. "I ask again, what will you answer?" she cried, still tempting the venerable maiden. 
               It was more than she could bear. "I wish you wouldn't ask me, if you don't want no answer," she said, sharply. "And I wish you wouldn't look at me in that way ma'am. I am not a hungry cassowary." 
               "You will answer," continued the speaker, heedless of the interruption, "'Antonia Goldman.' And the world will ask: Who is Antonia Goldman? There is no such name interwoven with the history of this land." 
               "I don't care if there isn't," said Miss Allen. "She will look best, and speak best, and that's the main thing. If you are so bent to be there Mrs. Waddlekins, you can accompany her." 
               "I don't desire any thing for myself," said that modest lady. "I merely wish to preserve the honor of the town." 
               "We might all go there in a body," suggested another, "and a committee can carry the flag, and Miss Goldman make the speech." 
               This opinion met with general approval, and after some further discussion, was adopted. When Antonia arrived, the result was communicated to her. 
               "Though if you don't like to," added Mrs. Waddlekins, "I think my daughter or myself might do it, to please you." 
               "Thank you," replied Antonia. "I shall be happy to accept the office, and only hope that I may be able to do it justice." 
               "Are you not afraid of your courage failing you at the last moment, child?" asked Miss Hopstring. "I remember that I was taken to a donation party by my father, when about twelve years old. It was at home in Newburyport, and our new minister had just moved into the parsonage. Father hitched up his horses, and gave me a big dish to carry into the house, and say to the minister: 'Mother's sick, sir, but she sends her dutiful compliments.' I carried it in, and came right up to the minister, and when he looked at me with his serious eyes I got frightened and dropped the dish, and burst into tears, and ran out of the house." 
               "Do not be uneasy about me Miss Hopstring," said Antonia. "I shall neither drop the flag, nor burst into tears, nor run." 
               The day of the presentation had arrived. Upon the green of Sycamore, which, as in all small towns is exceedingly ample, a battalion of cavalry was assembled. This battalion Tourtelotte had formed, and it was the only part of his regiment yet organized. The magnificent trees that enclosed the green arched their young-leaved branches over the numerous beholders whom curiosity or patriotism there assembled. A platform had been erected at one end, upon which the speaker, committee of presentation, and as many more ladies as it could accommodate, were to be placed. Carriage after carriage drove up and delivered its fair load. Soon the platform was crowded. Around the green were ranged vehicles from half a dozen of the neighborhood counties. This ceremony had assembled a greater number of strangers at Sycamore than the old town had ever contained. 
               In front of the platform, the sides of which were tastily concealed by young pine trees, was a flight of steps bordered by the same, and overarched with branches. Upon the highest of these steps stood Antonia Goldman, and three ladies bearing the new flag. Antonia was dressed in brilliant blue silk with a red scarf, the colors of the regiment, which was uniformed in blue jackets turned up with red. Her sunny hair was covered with a chip hat, from which descended a long white plume. Mrs. Waddlekins, who was one of the three flag-holders, aired her immortal black satin, that would only hook on top, and Miss Oglethorpe, her colleague, had on a wonderful garment of brimstone hue. All the rest of the ladies were in bright, lively colors, and the platform presented a picture which for brilliancy of tints could not well be excelled. 
               Now the bugles sounded, and the battalion began to drill. Right-left-forward-halt-guard against infantry-guard against cavalry-wheel-and so on. At last "charge!"-and as the whole front with drawn sabres came galloping on uttering fierce yells, every beholder's heart beat higher, and there was none there believed that a Northern line could resist such a charge. Finally they were gotten into order again, and mustered into line. The usual parade formula was gone through with, and when the battalion presented arms, the Colonel, accompanied by his staff, advanced to a point several paces from the steps of the platform. The presentation committee, with Antonia, descended scended, and the latter advancing, said in a deep voice, clear as a bell: 
               "Colonel: In the name of the ladies of our county, I have the honor to present your regiment with this flag. We know that you will guard it, and defend it. We know that you will honor and love it. May it lead you to victory, and freedom. May it droop gently over the graves of those destined to fall in the holy cause, and flaunt bravely in the eyes of the living, who will return after the heroic fight. Colonel, our hearts are with you. Whenever you cast your eyes upon this flag, remember, that the women of the South accompany you with their prayers, and when you strike a blow for yourselves, like valiant knights, strike another for your ladies' sake. The God of right and justice be with you." 
               Tremendous applause followed this speech, and Tourtelotte responded to it by a harangue, full of burning patriotism and grandiloquent assertions. The band, which was in attendance, came in with "Dixie," the "Marseillaise Hymn," and other appropriate tunes, and the ceremony was over. The flag was handed to its appropriate bearer, and the regiment marched off with its silken folds waving over it in the sighs of the breeze. 
               As the Goldmans drove home, Tourtelotte and Charles galloped up, and took position on either side of the carriage. Tourtelotte was in high spirits. He overwhelmed whelmed Antonia with compliments on her speech. 
               "You looked like an inspired priestess while delivering it," he said. "The pink in your cheeks deepened to crimson, and the brilliancy of your eyes obscured their color." 
               "I felt what I said," returned Antonia, calmly. "But I was truly nervous. Mrs. Waddlekins loomed up at my side continually, and did not cease to ply me with advice and suggestions." 
               "Did you feel what you said when you promised that your hearts should be with us?" 
               "I did," she replied; "but don't assume a sentimental tone on that account, please." 
               "Give me leave for one moment. I may rely on your heart being with me then?" 
               "With you and with all that fight bravely. But especially with you and Charles." 
               "Does that imply that you will not give your heart to any one else while we are away from home, fighting for the South," he asked, with some anxiety. 
               "I give you leave to interpret it so," she replied. "And when you return victoriously from the fields where you have fought for our rights and our liberty, when you come back with honorable laurels twined round your sword, then Frank Tourtelotte-" she paused with some confusion. 
               "Then," he repeated. "For God's sake speak on!" 
                
               "Then," she continued, the bright crimson mantling her cheek, and the brilliant fire returning to her eye, "that heart may be given wholly into your keeping, and-" 
               "And," repeated Tourtelotte, bending down to his horse's neck, his face irradiated with uncontrollable joy, and his voice hoarse with deep emotion, "and?" 
               "And something else added to it," she said, firmly, holding out her small white hand to him. 
               He seized it and covered it with passionate kisses, which she suffered without rebuke. 
               All this time they were driving on, and Charles kept the attention of the others fixed on his side of the carriage. At least folks pretended not to notice any thing. Thus they arrived at Pineland. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXI. 
               IT was a quiet, drowsy afternoon. Clouds covered the sky. The atmosphere was damp and heavy. The rain, which descended occasionally, fell without noise. One of those afternoons which turn people of gay temper serious, and the serious melancholy. When dull reading matter and sleep prove the only possible pastimes, unless wine and cards are resorted to. 
               Welland was with Emma Reichenau-tete-a-tete for the first time since the afternoon when she had refused Charles Goldman man. He was about to tell her his history, a relation which she dreaded. It had been put off once or twice, and in fact she had endeavored to escape it altogether. But Welland, with the utmost politeness and delicacy, yet with sufficient persistence, returned to the subject again and again. It was natural that he should do so. For the history of the past year furnished the key to his conduct toward her, and their relations could never again rest upon the basis of sincere friendship, until she was acquainted with it. 
               Emma's cheek was tinged with a feverish flush; she sent fitful glances to every object in the room, except Welland. His face and eye she avoided. Being in a measure compelled to hear his history, she was stung to feverish irritation by the consciousness that it was to serve as an explanation of his rejection of her hand. She acknowledged to herself that this was the plain fact. Welland had evaded her advances, and her pride, modesty and reserve had been alike sacrificed in vain. But all the more eager was she to carry on that method of transparent deception which people call keeping up appearances, and without which the wheels of society would not revolve smoothly. True, nobody is deceived, but every one pretends to be. By this mutual concession, meddlers are kept at a distance, and prevented from touching our raws. But so are friends also who might apply healing balm to them. No matter; we prefer to leave our sores to Time, whose finger is the only one that can touch them, without making them smart. 
               Thus Emma had received Welland with great liveliness, and now endeavored to make her conversation as sprightly as possible, which attempt was aided by her coquettish dress. 
               "I was born in the Palatinate," he began, "a province, every hill of which is a vineyard, and every plain a patchwork of fields in the highest state of cultivation. In fact," he added, with moist eyes, "a perfect garden of God." 
               "You resemble the Turks, who are said to locate Paradise directly above Mecca-with coffee for nectar, I suppose." 
               "Every man has his Mecca; my fatherland is mine." 
               "Were you a remarkable baby," she asked, frivolously. 
               "Very," he replied, half entering into her humor. "The nurse, I am told, declared that I was the finest baby she ever saw. But as she was wont to make that observation regarding every new comer, I think I have been excelled since. This fact demonstrates the constant improvement of the human race. 
               "My father died early. My mother was the kindest woman in the world." 
               "Every one's mother is." She repented as soon as she had said it. 
               He looked at her, then returned: 
               "I forgive you, for you never knew one. -We lived in a rambling old house, with a garden full of flowers. My most vivid recollections of boyhood are my strolling about that garden at my mother's side, and carrying the flowers she cut, or the fruits she gathered. Often we walked there in the bright moonlight, when the old trees waved their branches mysteriously, and the brook beyond the meadows filled the air with gentle murmurs. Then she talked to me of her favorite poets, and sought to open my mind to the beauties of their simpler verses. In this manner my imaginative faculties were developed early, and have acquired a power which forces me to keep them under curb continually." 
               "Will imagination bear a curb, and live?" 
               "It must bear a curb, if the mind would live. Unrestrained, it carries one to the mad-house. When I left boyhood behind, my mother died." 
               Emma cast down her eyes, and was silent. 
               "I grieved sadly at the time, and for years the recollection would bring on a paroxysm of sorrow. But I think of her now with calm joy, and I know that she is here at present, and I doubt not, conscious of all I feel and think." 
               "You are giving me a specimen of the powers of your imagination." 
               "True. But this is the imagination of the heart, which men call FAITH. 
               "I was further educated by an uncle, who sent me to college, where I passed some of the happiest years of my life." 
               "I have heard what sort of stuff happiness at college is made of. Drinking, fencing, and perpetrating practical jokes," said Emma. 
               "The stuff," responded Welland, "which it is made of everywhere, where wild young fellows, full of life and mischief, congregate." 
               "Oh, how I should like to be among them! That's unfeminine, aint it? But the wish came from the bottom of my heart," returned Emma. 
               "I was still at college," resumed the other, "when the revolution of '48 broke out. It assumed the best shape in those provinces that were washed by the waves of the Rhine. There the inhabitants inherit the warlike spirit of their ancestors, whose position, on the borders of France, involved them in every quarrel between the two countries. At the sam time they are a wine-drinking population, and possess many traits of the French. Thither flocked the students. There was I. We fought in vain, but we fought gallantly." 
               "And what did you fight for?" 
               "For liberty. For an ideal that can not be realized. We aimed so high that the impossibility of success was self-evident. We based our ideal on the virtue and constancy of men." 
               "And found that those qualities existed only among women?" 
                
               "We presume that they have them," replied Welland, bowing, "unless they have departed altogether from this world. To continue-one of my last acts previous to the breaking up of the revolutionary army, was an expedition to intercept a party of soldiers, who were convoying a large sum in specie of Government funds. This being the property of the enemy, was a proper prize, as our treasury was sadly exhausted at the time. I acted under orders from the Commanding General. We succeeded in getting the money, and were hastening back to camp. But our army had retreated. Compelled to follow with great caution we marched two days, forcing our roundabout way through the woods, and keeping as concealed as possible. On the second day we were compelled to bury the iron box containing the money, and divide in smaller parties to reach our people. The next day a considerable force was sent, which drove back the enemy's cavalry, and endeavored to secure the money. It was gone. The pit was there, the box had disappeared." 
               "What bad luck," exclaimed Emma, beginning to take interest. 
               "It was the first great misfortune of my life," replied Welland, "since the death of my mother-if I can call it a misfortune, that an angel should be removed to heaven. The misfortune lay somewhat in the fact that I belong to a nation which all the world is ever ready to suspect of dishonesty." 
               "They did not suspect you? How could they!" 
               "Many did not. Some did. Though by the evidence of my men I proved it to be impossible for me to have returned to the place where the money was concealed, yet they did not dismiss their suspicions altogether, simply because I was a Jew." 
               "A Jew!" she cried, with ill-concealed surprise. "Impossible." 
               "And yet true. A veritable descendant of the wearers of yellow rags, that were hunted throughout Europe by every race on the continent; and as such, claiming and taking social equality with all, not as a favor, but as a right." 
               "Excuse me," said Emma, with some confusion. "The name shocked me. We are apt to halt at a name, though we accept the idea." 
               "You are very kind," said Welland ironically. "I never thought of mentioning this before, as you never told me what persuasion you belonged to." 
               "But you are not"-a thought flashed upon her mind. Perhaps that was the reason of his indifference to her advances. He thought that she would disdain to marry a Jew. It was a little odd. But what cared she for his religion. Oh, how could she find out? He must finish the history of his life, and if religion prove the only obstacle, why- 
                
               With an eagerness that surprised Welland she urged the continuation of his tale. 
               "Immediately afterward, our army was defeated and scattered. It was "sauve qui peut." I fled to Switzerland, and later to Paris, and finally to the United States. In the meantime, my patrimony, which was quite considerable, was seized by the Government to idemnify the treasury. Fortunately it exceeded the sum captured. I was tried in my absence and condemned to imprisonment and hard labor, but have been pardoned since. Upon my pardon being granted, restitution was made of all that remained of my property, after satisfying the treasury. Thus I can not complain of the Government." 
               "Is this all?" inquired Emma impatiently. 
               "Are you tired? Excuse me, I have been tedious perhaps." 
               "No, no. Go on." And her eyes, full of the old charm, fastened upon his countenance. Her lips half opened, and the warm breath she exhaled seemed to touch his cheek. Again magnetic currents swept over him, and he grew confused and remained silent. 
               "I must hear all," she repeated. "Or have you done?" 
               "I have not done," he replied, continuing with an effort. "I came to New York. Some time I devoted to get acquainted with the New World. Some more in endeavoring to find out what I could do with myself self. An old college friend, whom I chanced to meet, said: 'Carve out a fortune for yourself in America? No Welland, you are not stupid enough, and ignorant enough, and thick-skinned enough to succeed in that." I found him correct to some extent. With my means I might have engaged in mercantile pursuits with advantage, but my ideas were too aristocratic, my sensibilities too acute to trade with profit to myself. Besides, I felt an unconquerable aversion to commerce. Label it with the grandest words, identify it with the greatest benefits to humanity, the simple working of it always remains a disposing of goods to advantage, a deception of another for your own profit. I know that I am expressing the impracticable ideas of a class that is passing away, but still they were my ideas at the time." Welland had recovered his composure. Emma grew listless and heaved an impatient sigh. 
               "What then?" she asked languidly. 
               "Then I turned to the studies I had pursued without an idea of turning them to practical use. I bethought me which might answer best for employment. I surveyed land, instructed in methamatics, and wrote articles for the papers. My success was satisfactory. But I never cared to earn more than I needed. Thus years passed. I had few social ties in this large city. There was no house where I could meet those of my class exclusively, and I would not associate with the ignorant or ill-bred, I was too much of a German for that. Finally I yearned to leave New York. The South attracted me most. I hoped to find there what I had been compelled to abandon in the old country. I had some friends who procured me an appointment in Tennessee, and thither. I went." 
               "And after a few months you left there to return to New York. Is not that all?" asked Emma. 
               "Not quite," replied Welland. While in Tennessee I was hospitably received by a family, one member of which you are acquainted with. I refer to Charles Goldman's parents. I was their guest more than once. In their house I felt perfectly at home. For the first time during my sojourn in this country I tasted the sweetness of life, as a member of a family I could assimilate with; I was charmed. I returned often. Charles Goldman has a sister." 
               He stopped for a moment. Emma was breathless and expectant. 
               "She is like him," he resumed. "Antonia is beautiful and good. From the first moment I beheld her I was attracted. Every day deepened the impression. But our circumstances are widely different, and I resisted the charm. In vain; it grew on me. I loved to distraction and told her so. And that sweet angel gave me her heart. We are betrothed. Yes, we are betrothed, and I am the happiest man in the world. Oh, if you could hear that deep, glorious voice, see those sea-blue eyes, and notice her graceful, winning ways, you could not help but love her yourself." 
               "You forget that my imaginative powers are not equal to yours," said Emma, in a voice hard and cold as ice. 
               "Pardon my raptures"- 
               But she asked: 
               "Do the parents consent? I wish you joy." 
               "They know nothing of it, and would object, I fear." 
               "Ah! that is quite romantic. You intend then to carry your lady off secretly? run away with her?" 
               "You are pleased to laugh at me." 
               "Why not? She would not object I suppose." 
               "Madame! Antonia has too much heart, and I too much honor to think of such a measure." 
               "Oh, what a couple of scrupulous lovers! I suppose you will be content to live separate in this life, hoping to meet in the next, where no cruel parents exist." 
               "Not quite; but years may pass before our hands are joined. What matter, if we love each other?" 
               "And is this all you wish to tell me?" 
               "I fear I have detained you longer than necessary or pleasant." 
               "Make no apologies. My bird is the only sufferer. It should have been fed hours ago." 
               "Will you permit me to return on another day and bore you on a different subject?" 
               "I can't promise until I have reflected on what you have told me to-day." 
               He took his leave, and Emma felt the old weariness creep over her. She leaned her forehead against the window, and looked out upon the drowsy, rainy world. All gray and leaden; everything heavy and dank. Not a gleam of light, not a speck of brightness. Dull and weary without; dull and weary within. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXII. 
               FORT Sumpter had fallen. The first call for volunteers went forth. Civil war was in the land. Both North and South the excitement was immense. So great a popular commotion found no precedent but in that of the French nation at the Fall of the Bastile. Men, women and children shared alike in the strong feelings and the deep patriotism brought to the surface by the attempt to tear the country in two. Both sections arose, like rival giants, to enter upon a struggle, which was only to end when half a million of their sons had died a death alike glorious and holy. 
               But it is not our intention to treat of the war, except as it concerns the characters of this novel. We will therefore say that Welland, carried away by the enthusiasm which, like a fiery cloud swept over the North, was one of the first to enlist. On account of his previous experience in the revolution of 1848, which Reichenau urged with those in power, his election to a lieutenancy was brought about. Thus we see him, the straps on his shoulder, make his farewell visit to Emma and her father. That young lady had gone to account with herself, after her acquaintance with Welland's history. His pre-engagement to Antonia was a salve to her wounded pride. He had known and loved another before ever seeing her, and honor forbade a swerving from his plighted faith. She could only complain of fate. Calling up the real strength she was capable of exerting, she put down her sentimental attachment to Welland, and behold-when she once put her hand to the work, it was wonderful how little labor was necessary. It was a controversion of all the doctrines about first love, broken hearts, and eternal attachments. Perhaps the soil was not deep, and perhaps the feeling had not struck strong roots, but when she seized it with determined hand, out it came, and left her heart-whole. The patriotic excitement of the time served to fill the void, and she grandly flattered herself to have substituted love of country for love of a man. 
               So the bands played, and the flags waved, and the people shouted, as the regiments ments marched to the depot. And away they went en route for the National Capital. 
               Welland was accompanied by the negro boy Ned, who had become greatly attached to him. When they arrived in Washington, and got settled in barracks, he was occupied at all hours in drilling not only his own company, but also every other in the regiment. This was not all. There were not a few of his fellow officers who needed the same teaching, and to them he administered it in private as well as possible. 
               He had been residing for two weeks in camp when, together with a pleasant letter from Reichenau, he received another from Sharp. With great delight he retired, and after glancing over the first missive put it away, and prepared for reading the second. 
               A chair was drawn to the window, and a cigar lighted. Ned pulled off his master's boots and substituted slippers. Then Welland leaned back, and placing his feet on another chair, reflectively looked at the letter. Slowly he called up in his mind the dapper little figure of the writer, with his sharp looks and kind smile; then the pine woods and their long green aisles; then Antonia on her gray pony; and finished by drawing the little book she had given him from a pocket inside his vest, and fervently kissing it. 
                
               At last he was in a proper frame of mind, and opened the letter. It ran thus: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "MY DEAR YOUNG FRIEND:-I am afraid the world is turning crazy. I look about with astonishment, and can scarce recognize in our neighbors the people I have known so long. There is not a soul in Claiborne County thinks about setting out the crops; not a man has gone to work. All they talk of is secession, liberty and fighting, and other nonsense of this kind. The women are the worst. They jabber twenty times more than they ever did, and neglect their houses to pull lint and embroider flags, and above all, to see the soldiers. Every man is a soldier now, and the miserable canaille, instead of being content to leave tomfoolery to the planters, and try to earn an honest living, also spend their time in drilling and marching, and swear 'they'll bust up the North.' The very niggers are beyond management, and I am sick of my life, in trying to get the Spring work done at Pineland. Of course, there being such a fuss about Northern people, all our Yankee overseers had to leave us, and those were the only ones worth any thing. The Southern men I am able to get want high salaries, and are off half the time, in the service of the country, they say. As if the service of the country would make the corn grow! But I dare not say what I think about these things, in fear for life and limb. People are very rough, and there is no protection for a peaceable citizen. So I must even howl with the wolves. 
                           "There has been great rejoicing, and the most abominable firing of cannon over the secession act of the State. It was impossible to go through the streets of Sycamore without risking one's life. Men, boys, and even children handled and discharged firearms arms of all kinds. I never was afraid of a French gun. But these American pistols and rifles are so unsafe, that one can't tell when they will go off, and in which direction they'll shoot. Besides, they have the agreeable faculty of exploding occasionally. 
                           "I don't know why they are going to fight. If they had a king to drive away, there would be some sense in it. Or if they had a man fit to be made emperor. But as it is, they are spending their money in vain, and money enough it will cost, I assure you. 
                           "Our family is as bad as the rest. Mrs. Goldman is the only sensible person in the house. The others are downright crazy. If it were only the children, I should excuse them on account of their youth. As for Mr. Goldman, I could excuse him also, on account of his sinful indulgence in every whim of the spoiled young ones. But, think my dear friend, Madame la Generale, a lady of the highest rank, of infinite experience and lofty mind; a lady that has associated with kings and emperors, one of the best patience and l'hombre players in the world-Madame la Generale is crazy as well as the rest. She insists that Charley shall go into battles, and shoot off guns, and fight with men, and get killed. And she says that he must win laurels. Why must he win laurels? Who wants laurels? What are they worth? What shall he do with them, after he has got them? Give me one sound reason for this absurd demand, and I will not say another word. When they talk of gloire in France, I can understand. It means the legion d'honneur. That's something. When you wear it in your buttonhole, people pull off their hats, and the maire and gensd'armes are polite to you. But here in America? Nonsense. Madame encourages Charley, all she can, and to her it will be owing, if a misfortune happens. 
                           "Antonia is no better. She has been embroidering flags, and presenting them; she has pulled all the old rags in the house to pieces for lint, so, that one could not approach her without getting one's clothes full of white threads. That however, has not prevented Mr. Tourtelotte, who is a Colonel now-isn't it ridiculous-from sitting with her and very near her too, whenever he has leisure, which is all the time the soldiers are not drilling. He is the craziest of all. But he knows why. There are debts and mortgages on his estate more than he can ever pay off, and they are all owned by Northern men. It pays for him to be crazy. It's a cheap way of paying debts. He has been very smart in this. But why should we be so? We have no debts or mortgages. Our lands and our crops belong to no Northern men. God knows! 
                           "And now I must communicate a queer change in my little Antonia. She proclaims herself to be a Southern woman, and enters into all the warlike and political tantrums with feverish excitement. In connection with this, Colonel Tourtelotte occupies a high place in her esteem, and does all he can to augment the violence of her anti-Northern opinions. Charley, who is a friend and devoted admirer of Tourtelotte, must have inclined Antonia in his favor, and perhaps cried you down to her. I have several times endeavored to get him to speak of you, but in vain. He says that his acquaintance is so slight that he knows almost nothing of you. Antonia has spoken of you once and then with severity, and forbidden me ever mentioning the subject again. Notwithstanding, I have tried to get at the cause of this change, but unsuccessfully. She will not speak of you, or hear any thing said about you. 
                            
                           "My dear young friend, this turn has grieved me much. I don't know whether the fault is yours. I do not believe it is. But there seems little chance of setting matters right at present. I will risk the utmost to keep Antonia from taking an irremediable step, before you have had ample opportunity to clear up the doubts, that seem to have crept between you two. But that is all I can do. My plans were well laid, my calculations correctly made, and all would have been brought to a satisfactory issue, had not this crazy nation taken it into its head to rebel, or revolutionize, or at any rate set an excitement on foot, which an honest man could not calculation. God grant that this state of affairs may not last long, and then do not lose any time in coming to Pineland. I have some difficulty in forwarding this letter, and do not know when I will be able to hear from you. But write as soon as there is a reasonable chance of the letter reaching me. 
                           With great regard, I am 
                           
                              Your friend and Obd't Serv't, 
                              SELLINGTON SHARP."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Welland was greatly perplexed by the contents of this epistle. He held the cigar in his hand until it had gone out, and then angrily threw it away. 
               "Oh women, women," he cried, "the same all the world over! Out of sight, out of mind. What if I had acted thus? But no-I am a man. I will hold to my troth until Antonia herself tells me that I must not think of her any more. Oh God!" and he laid his head back upon the chair, and tortured himself with all sorts of fanciful pictures, in which a young lady in a blue habit was carried off by a black-haired Creole, while he himself, killed in battle, was carried to the grave to the mournful sound of muffled drums. 
               Ned appeared. It seems that Welland's instructions had been of some service, for the negro boy could read a little. He had spelled out the postmark of the letter before Welland's return, and knew it came from Tennessee. Accordingly he was full of expectation. 
               When Welland remained silent, Ned took heart of grace, and asked: "Heard from Massa Sharp, sir?" 
               The young man turned impatiently, and said with forced composure: "Yes, Ned. He is well." 
               "Don't he write nothing about me, sir?" 
               "Nothing, my boy. Have you cleaned my sword?" 
               "Bright as a tin pan. Don't he write about the family, sir? Nothing at all?" 
               "Yes. He says they are well. Get my dress uniform ready." 
               "All ready, sir. Don't he speak of the ladies, sir?" 
               "Yes. They are well. That button is loose, Ned." 
               "I'll sow it on in a minute. What ladies do he write about, sir?" he continued while at work fastening the button. 
               "All of them. You are sowing it on too high." 
               "Just where the old button was. Do he write of the colored ladies?" 
               "Of who?" asked Welland in great surprise. 
                
               "Of the colored ladies? Those that live in the house." 
               "Nothing about them, Ned. Now give me my cap and gloves." 
               Ned turned up his eyes, and heaved a deep sigh. "She have forgotten me, sir." 
               "Ah?" and Welland smiled involuntarily. "Is she pretty?" 
               "She's the beautifullest saddle colored girl in the country, sir. And she have forgotten me entirely!" 
               "Well, don't forget to hand me my cap and gloves." 
               The lieutenant left, Ned closed the tent, and then danced a jig to get rid of his rage. The way he pounded the floor, and struck out his elbows, would have made his fortune in any New England minstrel troupe. It relieved him. He shook his fists at several imaginary gentlemen of color, whom he suspected of having supplanted him, and then being disturbed by the entrance of the wash-woman, began a flirtation with her over Welland's towels and collars, and consented to overlook the absence of a handkerchief, in consideration of a kiss to be delivered there and then, which agreement was at once carried out to the satisfaction of the contracting parties. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXIII. 
               NEARLY sixteen months had passed.-Bull Run had been fought, and McClellan summoned. The three hundred thousand had marched to Washington. The Virginia mud had been cried down in all the forms of old and new anathemas, while the army was organized and drilled, waiting for its subsidence. At last they were embarked and landed at Yorktown, and that brilliantly conceived campaign opened, which failed in the end for want of sufficient support from home. Failed, when within the reach of success, by the rivalry or faint-heartedness of comrades and home officers, and the chivalrous leader was forced to turn back, to save the remnants of his army. Then the mad career of Pope began and ended, all in a few weeks. The great Virginia General neglected not to reap the fruits of his successes, but led his columns North, into the fields of Maryland and Pennsylvania. A popular uprising in the former State was expected. But in vain. With the recall of McClellan, who gathered the fragments of the decimated Peninsular army, and the beaten battalions of Pope around him, the retreat of Lee began. On every road the Union army pressed forward. Horse, foot, and artillery they hurried on from point to point toward that field of glory, where so many were to close their eyes for ever. Maryland seemed enveloped in the coils of a huge serpent, as the continuous columns of dark blue crept forward on her highways. And at last they reached the hills in the North. Several spurs had been crossed in the rich September sunlight, while the shining fields, the silvery springs, and the hazy mountains, woke home feelings in every breast. Frederick City was entered, and the tail of the Southern army trodden on. Onward to Middletown! And now we are at Turner's Gap, which Longstreet holds and means to defend. 
               Among those, who on that afternoon hurried forward to engage in the combat, was Rodman's division of the 9th Army Corps. This corps had come up from Newbern, then rested at Fredericksburg, and was in a far better condition than many others. They had been ordered to the front. Gen. Rodman with his staff rode in advance of the division. He was conversing with Welland, now a major of a New York regiment, on staff duty with him as Assistant Inspector General. They were ordered to send one brigade to the left, and themselves guide the other to a ridge on the extreme right, where Benjamin's battery held a loud conversation with the enemy's guns. Concealed in the woods, they supported this battery. 
               The South Mountain range at this point is about a thousand feet above the level of the surrounding country. The irregular and tortuous gap which divides it for over half the height, is still four hundred feet higher than the plains. The highway from Middletown passes through this gap. On one side, there rises a boldly-swelling ridge, on the other, two smaller ridges divided by a narrow strip of low land. The character of the whole is irregular and rocky, and the county road, as well as two country roads passing over the smaller ridges, is frequently bordered by low walls of stone. 
               One must have been in the mountainous and rocky parts of our country to appreciate those stone walls. The materials are found on the spot. The farmer clears his field of flint and bowlders, and heaps them up around it in the shape of a rough wall. The dust flies, the rain falls, the butterflies and birds carry seed, and in time parasite plants spring up that cement the materials, and with a hundred vegetable arms bind each bowlder to its neighbors. The structure is exceedingly firm, yet full of loopholes, that permit the glance of an eye as well as the barrel of a gun to pass through. We have mentioned that the road was bordered by these. But we must not forget to say that they, in many cases, ran between fields, and traversed the land in every direction. 
               The enemy had taken position in the pass. His batteries enfiladed the county road. Every ridge was loud with the boom of his cannon and the rattle of his musketry. Cavalry was out of the question. But for artillery and infantry this was a proper battle field. General Rodman detached his first brigade and sent it to the right. Welland guided it to the proper commander, and then returned to the ridge, where the second brigade was just taking a covered position in the woods, and from the crest of which Benjamin's guns kept up an enfilading fire. The resistance of the enemy at this point was very strong. They had posted, a brigade behind one of these stone walls, where the artillery could not reach them, and from which bullets rebounded without effect. All the afternoon the efforts to dislodge them were unavailing. Several regiments had tried, and been repulsed with loss. In addition to the other advantages of this position, there was a rocky depression or gorge on the federal side of this stone wall, which made a bayonet charge if not impossible, at least highly hazardous. 
               The points of this position were so clear, that the troops if not positively discouraged, at least began to regard it as impossible to carry the ridge from that side. They commenced to seek cover, and fire at the enemy whenever it was perceived that a head rose above the upper periphery of the stone wall. But these few shots were worse than useless. They did not even prevent the Southern sharpshooters from picking off our artillery men. And thus the afternoon waned. 
               It was evident however that the position must be taken. This ridge commanded the next, both commanded the highway through the Gap, and the lofty crest on the other side could not be held without possession of these. So a new advance was ordered, and new troops came to make it. 
               Among these was a western regiment. A regiment that had been formed about a month before in the agricultural districts of Michigan. A regiment that had not been drilled much, or possessed much knowledge of tactics and the manual of arms. A regiment that did not keep a very clean, soldierly appearance, or practised that perfect subordination and regard for military rank which some of our eastern regiments prided themselves on. In short, a regiment of rough, hearty, courageous western men, with sinews of steel and hearts of iron, with spare long-limbed bodies and sunburnt faces, that knew what they were expected to do, and could handle their muskets as the hunter of the prairies can handle his rifle. 
               The aid-de-camp who directed this regiment, and the New York troops following it, was struck by a bullet as they emerged from the cover of the woods. At the General's suggestion, Welland took his place. 
               Forward, march! Not by quickstep, but slowly they advance, their guns at ready, and their eyes upon the stone wall. They come on, reserving their fire. Through the crevices of the rocky barrier, flash the guns of the enemy. Here a shot, and there a shot. Here a bullet, and there a bullet. Here a dead comrade, and there a wounded one. No matter. Slowly, composedly, and without halt for dead or wounded, their muskets ready sighted, and their eyes on the stone wall, they still advance. Now they are at close range. A yell rings through the air. Simultaneously the whole rebel line arises, and a perfect sheet of fire sweeps across the gorge, and is returned at the same moment. A shiver passes through the regiment. For a moment it hesitates, then again advances. The flag has changed hands. He who first bore it, now bears palms above. The front line has changed, and its fragments follow the rear line as best they might. Still onward! 
               Just then it becomes evident that the former manoeuver will be repeated, and in the long run, notwithstanding quick aim and ready fire, the Michigan men will have the worst of it. Accordingly the word is passed: "Fire as soon as you see their caps." And well they do it. Another yell, another leaping up of butternut suits, and the fire from our valiant westerners flashes in a long line over the crest of the stone wall, and every bullet has found its mark, ere it can be returned. Again and again. Over the rocky fragments, and the entrapping holes in the gorge, still onward, not quickly, but in slow time, and full of deliberation. At last they are at the wall. Now yell, brave soldiers! Over in hot haste! With mighty leaps they clear it. The muskets become clubs. The men are tigers. They bound upon the flying rebels, and rend them. The New York Highlanders come up. A tremendous fire dislodges the enemy, who tries to make a stand against the fragments of the Michigan regiment. They retreat, they fly. The ridge is ours! Almost crazy with excitement the Michigan men try to follow, and it is with difficulty they are restrained. One third of the regiment is dead or wounded on one side of the stone wall, and three hundred of the enemy lie on the other, every one shot through the head.
                
               A battery is brought up. It clears the next ridge. The pass is enfiladed. A charge sweeps back the columns of Long-street from a position which has become untenable. The ninth corps presses forward; over the dead body of Reno they wrest the palm of victory from the reluctant hand of the Southern leader, and the pass and battle of South Mountain are won. 
               And where has Welland been during this time? Leading that gallant Michigan regiment-the 17th-until his horse was shot under him. Then he extricated himself, and as well as his bruises would allow, moved forward with a few, that had straggled, and posted them on the road to the right of the stone wall. More stragglers gathered, and all were put in such a position that they could command the road. The wisdom of this arrangement, to guard the position already gained, was immediately evident. A bugle sounded, and a company of the enemy's cavalry galloped up the road to make a diversion in favor of their infantry, who had not yet given way to the New York 79th. They were allowed to approach; then Welland commanded "Fire!" The firing was not very accurate or efficient. Still it proved sufficient to intimidate the cavalry. They halted, and the bugler gave the signal for "Wheel to the right! March!" They turned and galloped off. Yet not all. Two remained on the field. One was a bugler, who lay dying on the roadside, while his horse whinnied over him. The other was a Colonel. His right rein had broken while violently pulling his horse about, and the motion sent the animal in a direction opposite from that intended. Before he recovered, the horse had carried him into Welland's line, and several guns were levelled at him. With a sweep of his sabre he beat them down, but could not turn his horse. He would have been a dead man had not Welland commanded his men not to fire. 
               "You are a prisoner, Colonel Tourtelotte. Dismount!" 
               Tourtelotte dismounted, and said, laughing: 
               "The fortune of war, Major Welland. I thank you for sparing my life." 
               "I was returning a favor, sir. You did as much for me." 
               "We may call quits then," and the Southern Colonel followed his escort to the rear. 
                
               Welland held his position till late in the evening. But the point was not again attacked. He stepped up to the poor bugler, who lay with closed eyes, breathing heavily. A bullet had passed through his chest. 
               "Can I do any thing for you?" he asked. 
               The man groaned. "Are the Yankees whipped?" he inquired in a low voice, and with difficulty. "Tell me that." 
               "They don't happen to be just now, my friend, I guess," said one of the men who had gathered around. "The whipping's on the other side of the house." 
               The dying man opened his eyes. 
               "Never mind," he said, with more vigor, "the South'll prevail anyhow. God is with us!" 
               Welland interfered. "Have you any message for your friends?" he asked, kindly. "I will take charge of it." 
               "You don't catch me," returned the bugler. "You want me to give you my love letters, and publish them in your infernal Northern papers. No, you don't." 
               "Very well," returned the major. "Do as you think best." 
               After a while the man handed Welland a small packet, and looking beseechingly at him, said: 
               "Don't publish these. Send them to their address, and you may have my mare. I have raised her from a colt." 
               "I'll attend to it. Your mare belongs to the Government," said Welland. Pocketing ing the parcel of letters, he mounted her, nevertheless. 
               "Take him to a surgeon," he ordered. But it was unnecessary. He died before they could lift him up. 
               Welland now galloped back to Gen. Rodman, whom he found very nervous. 
               "Where's the 4th Rhode Island? Where's the 4th Rhode Island?" asked the General. "I can't find the 4th Rhode Island." 
               Welland accompanied him in his search. The crest whereon Benjamin's battery was placed was densely wooded, and cut up by innumerable paths that crossed and recrossed each other, so that it was exceedingly difficult to follow any direction with consequence. The regiments lay concealed in the underbrush, and it had grown so dark that it was an impossibility to find them, all the more, as the strictest silence had been enjoined. Thus it happened that the General and his staff suddenly emerged from the trees at the bottom of the hill, and found themselves within a few rods of a rebel line. A precipitate retreat again carried them to the crest, without being able to perceive their own brigade. 
               People were busy there. The few miserable huts that lay in the vicinity were crowded with the wounded and the dying. A one-story house to the right of the road accommodated over fifty. Not only the house, but the front yard was crowded with them. Hospital attendants spread their rubber blankets from tree to tree to keep the chilly dews off. By the light of a tallow candle, which an attendant held, a surgeon was amputating a leg, while several bloody limbs at his side testified to his past labors. It was a short man, and one of practical sense. He assembled the attendants, and picking out three of the vilest looking, said: 
               "To-morrow morning, boys, I want you to go and steal whatever you can lay hands on in the meat line, fish, flesh or fowl. Bring it here. I authorize you to do it." 
               Then he sent others to build a fire, and went on dressing wounds, and administering whisky or morphine, as the case dictated. The hours flew. It was twelve o'clock ere the army could be heard to move on. The heavy wagons with their six mule teams rolled rumblingly over the road that had witnessed such fierce fighting a few hours before. Suddenly the surgeon stepped out of his hovel hospital, and halted one of them. As a matter of course the whole line, miles of wagons, were compelled to halt. 
               "I want some coffee, sugar and hard tack out of your wagon," said the medical man, in a decided manner. 
               "Can't give you any," was the return. "Don't belong to me." 
               "I command you to let me have them for my sick. I'll give you an order, or a receipt." 
               "Can't do it, doctor. I don't know you. If you had an order from a General-" 
                
               "Very well then. By order of General Humanity I require them. I must have them, and will take them." 
               This decided tone, together with the immense amount of cursing which arose from the drivers behind, who wanted to get on, decided the soldier, and he resigned a moiety of his load to the doctor. In consequence, the latter was enabled to present to his wounded a cup of strong coffee at one o'clock at night, and even treat the enemy's folks, who lay weltering in their blood scattered over the wide field, and as yet uncared for, with some of the refreshing beverage. 
               Welland slept on the field wrapt in his overcoat, as the General and all his staff did, and dreamt that Tourtelotte had returned to Tennessee, married Antonia, and was relating to her how his life had been saved by the man she had loved and forgotten. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIV. 
               THE sun of Antietam rose. The mists of morning had not yet unveiled the rich September landscape when the boom of cannon saluted the ears of the army. Burnside's position was on the left, and his corps remained inactive during the greater part of the forenoon. The Commander of the army, not foolhardily risking the safety of the Capital and of Pennsylvania and Maryland on the issue of this battle, attacked in a manner which made failure impossible, if it precluded a complete success. It must be confessed, however, that this success was still lessened by Burnside's tardiness. 
               Gen. Rodman's division was to attack the stone bridge in Burnside's front. They were shifted about in the woods, and under cover of hillocks to escape the enemy's shells until the proper time had arrived for the attack. That time was eleven o'clock. Then the commander calculated that his right wing would be grappling the left and center of the enemy's line, and the 9th Corps could find little opposition. 
               Eleven struck from the white steeples of Sharpsburg, Keedysville, and Hazardville, but was not heard in the noise of battle. One of Burnside's aids came galloping to Gen. Rodman and ordered the advance. Welland was despatched to Harland's brigade with this order. Harland led his regiments to the creek. Gently it flowed between banks covered with green turf, and shaded by magnificent willow trees that dipped their long branches in the water. An old fashioned stone bridge of a single arch spanned the limpid stream. On the other side the bank was low and level for about thirty feet, and then rose abruptly to a considerable height, which was covered with trees and bushes. The regiments endeavored to ford the stream, since the bridge was swept by guns, and defended by a strong force. A gallant captain of a Connecticut regiment, seeing the men hesitate, leaped into the water, and with sabre and revolver advanced to the center of the creek, where the bullet of a sharpshooter pierced his body. His men dragged him ashore. Learning that his wound was mortal, he said with a smile, "This is the death I have always wished to die." The same, when the day after, in the last agonies he was forced to retch violently, said to the officers surrounding his bed: "Excuse me, gentlemen, but I can not help it," and died. A polished gentleman to the last. 
               There was considerable hesitation now. The men looked for cover, and fired at the opposite shore, where no mark was perceptible. The enemy's sharpshooters were well concealed and picked off about two hundred men. Valuable time was lost, and when Burnside's corps should have been tugging at the rebel line on the other side, a few regiments only were firing blindly across the creek from this. At one o'clock, however, a positive order was given to carry the bridge. Gen. Ferraro, the best dancing master in the country, advanced with his brigade. Leading them forward under cover of an inequalty of ground, he charged at a full run, and with an impetuosity and vigor which swept all obstacles from before him. Two New York regiments in strong column, with bayonets fixed, rushed across, and the guns which had defended the position were presently in their hands, and turned against the enemy. The whole corps crossed immediately after. 
               It was not long before the steep ridge was cleared, and a considerable advance made. Soon, however, Burnside's troops were forced to descend into a hollow planted with corn, that lay in the range of a battery posted on the crest of the opposite slope. An attack was ordered. Regiment after regiment charged through the thick standing corn. The field was bounded above by the road, and on the farther side of this road ran a stone wall. Troops supporting the battery were posted behind this rural fortification. As the charging columns came near a perfect hail of bullets burst from behind this wall and cut through the corn-stalks, dropping them right and left, and with them many a brave soldier. The battery opened at short range. Pieces of railroad iron, bags of nails, and iron bars, flew through the faltering regiments, who wavered, rallied, fell back again, rallied once more, and finally fled to the cover of the hollow, or behind the further ridge. An old rail fence divided this corn field from the road. Two days after fifty bullet holes were counted in a piece of one of the rails a foot in length. A small regiment from the wooden nutmeg State attempted another charge. Their colonel at the head, they passed up the slope with true contempt of death. Another rally, and another attack! Again beaten back. Once more, and they have the battery. Their colors have changed hands every few minutes. Their ammunition is spent. Their ranks have been cut down. Can they hold it? 
               Not unless fresh troops support them. But where are these? Not forthcoming. The enemy makes a desperate attempt to regain the guns. Worn down with fatigue, riddled with shot, dispirited by want of support, the brave little regiment reduced to few more than a hundred men, falls back and abandons the prize. They have done all, but sacrificed the entire regiment, and all in vain. 
               Gen. Rodman has been carried off the field with a bullet through his chest. Welland watches with him that eventful night. That night, when everybody looked for a renewal of the fight in the morning. At this time the General's wound is not thought mortal, though it afterward proved to be so. 
               It is a fine old farm house they happened upon, and well stocked, as it turns out. Welland, the first moment he was at liberty, rushed to the kitchen for something to eat. He found Ned in the midst of a number of pots containing preserved fruit, which the negro had carried down from the garret. He was engaged on preserved strawberries, and they disappeared down his throat by the ladleful. 
                
               "Some meat!" cried Welland, "can't you find me some meat?" 
               "Plenty of chickens," replied Ned. "Shall I cook some for you?" 
               "Yes, immediately. What is this?" he asked, lifting the lid off a pot which emitted a savory odor. "Chickens, by the eternal gods! Whose are they?" 
               "They is for the servants," replied Ned uneasily. "I can get some ready for the gentlemen in a little time." 
               "Thank you," replied Welland, "these will do." 
               He lifted the pot from the fire, carried it into the sitting-room, where those of the staff that remained alive and sound were congregated with some of Burnside's officers. They fell over the meat like starving men. A mess-kettle of coffee that was sent from a field hospital established in the barn, proved most grateful. They drank it from old tin cups, and champagne rose could not have tasted better. 
               The garden in front of the house was full of wounded and dying. With lanterns the surgeons picked their way among them, giving comfort according to their ability. Straw, and perhaps a blanket, with the knapsack for a pillow, were all the accommodations, morphine and whisky the chief medicines, coffee and hard bread the food. Quiet was already settling on the exhausted sufferers, when an Orderly galloped up and said: 
                
               "All the wounded that can be removed must be sent back at once. Another attack is expected." 
               Now the ambulances are put in motion, and the poor fellows crowded in. There is a wild cry from many not to be left in the hands of the rebels. Others again, fatigued to death, demand to be abandoned to their fate. They will not stir. One captain, with both legs shattered, is carried by four of his men in a blanket. Another, in the act of being put on a stretcher, expires. Both have just come from home. The one a professor at Amherst College, the other a prominent member of the bar in New England. 
               At last the ambulances are gone. Silence falls upon the barn and the garden. Sleep has closed the eyes of the sufferers, and the dead stillness is only broken by the tread of the guards, or the hurried step of a Zouave chasing a chicken over the bodies of his suffering comrades. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXV. 
               THE morning comes, and the fight is not renewed. Both armies are employed in burying their dead. A number of wounded lie between the outposts of the two lines suffering from hunger and thirst, which can not be assuaged. Early in the morning a chaplain has ventured among them, and become a mark for the enemy's bullets. They are abandoned in consequence. 
                
               Welland galloped to the spot where his regiment had passed the night. The Adjutant met him with congratulations. 
               "The Colonel is among the killed, and the Lieutenant Colonel badly wounded. The latter will be completely disabled. So I suppose you will take charge at once." 
               "Of course," replied Welland. "I will report these facts at Division Headquarters." 
               He was ordered to take command of his regiment, and a Colonel's commission was not long in arriving, especially as Reichenau kept his interests in view, and failed not to urge matters at Albany whenever there seemed to be any doubt or hesitation. 
               In a few days the army left Antietam creek, and passed to Pleasant Valley. They lay there all through the long sunny autumn days, with the gorgeous colors just tinting the leaves, and the verdant hills inclosing them on every side. A fine road ran along the hills to the left, under magnificent trees, and commanding a beautiful stretch of country, which led to the Potomac. As one approached the river the trees grew denser and darker, and at the end between two pine-covered promontories, there was a region of perpetual gloom. Immediately beyond this, the sunlight slept wonderfully sweet and bright upon the broad glassy expanse of the Potomac and its picturesque banks. Ride to the North, and on one side flows the great calm river, while on the other rise the rocky battlements of Maryland heights. Ride to the South, and the hills assume a softer character, and wear mantles of velvetty turf. Cast your glance across, and Bolivar heights with the whole ride frown down upon the red bricks of Harper's Ferry, while the Shenandoah, like a glittering serpent, picks its way between these steep and rocky crests. The weather was beautiful, and the mellow October air, with its soft hazes, contributed to enhance the peaceful aspect of this most pleasant of all valleys. 
               Colonel Tourtelotte, while passing to the rear at South Mountain, had received a slight wound. He was lingering in one of the confederate hospitals at Middletown. When Welland heard of it he determined to pay him a visit. His doubts must be cleared up, his mind set at rest. He had not heard from Sharp, or indeed from any one in Tennessee, since the receipt of that letter at Washington, which gave so fatal a blow to his hopes. He would now find out what was the state of affairs from Tourtelotte himself. 
               "Ned," he said, one evening, "saddle my horse at five to-morrow morning. I am going to be away for a couple of days." 
               "Yes sir. Shall I go along on the bugler's mare?" 
               "If you wish. I am going to see one of your Tennessee acquaintances." 
               "Master Charley? I don't want him to see me, sir. I kept hid from him in New York, sir. Is he a prisoner?" 
               "No; not master Charley, but Colonel Tourtelotte." 
               Ned's eyes twinkled, and a broad grin overspread his features. 
               "Is master Tourtelotte a prisoner?" 
               "He is, and wounded." 
               "Sir, is his dog Ugly a prisoner too?" 
               "I don't know. Are you interested in the dog, Ned?" 
               "I'se want to kill him. What you going to do to master Tourtelotte? Make the Union soldiers tie his hands and feet? I'se like to see him." 
               "You will not have an opportunity. After all, you had better remain here. Remember at five, to-morrow morning." 
               Welland had received permission for himself, his Major and a lieutenant, acting as Quartermaster, to go to Middletown. They arose at five o'clock and gathered around the breakfast table, where the cook served them with coffee and cold meats. 
               "Griddle cakes is coming, Kurnel," remarked that worthy to Welland. 
               They made their appearance presently. Wheat cakes slighty baked on a griddle. Not unsavory if eaten with butter or molasses. Major Schonherr, promoted a few days ago, and consequently an entirely new member of the field and staff mess, tasted them with hesitation, and then said politely: 
                
               "Colonel, please help me to another of these thunderbolts." 
               "You are a courageous man, Major," replied Welland, "to attack our Jove of the kitchen so openly." 
               "They's so heavy because of the morning dew," said the cook, gruffly. "Cakes wont rise so early in the morning, any way you can fix it." 
               They were all three well mounted, and galloped along at a slashing rate. The mists were still heavy, and obscured the view. But slowly the sun pierced and riddled them with golden shafts. As they rolled up, the trees and the tall waving grain were disclosed bathed in dew, and sparkling in the light with innumerable crystal drops. The birds sang gaily, and the horses blow clouds of steam from their nostrils. 
               Major Schonherr was a German, with a head as round as a bullet, a complexion of clear white and red, large, open eyes, and short hair. There were indications of a coming moustache on his upper lip, but all efforts of nature, assisted by art, had not yet succeeded in bringing out that masculine ornament. It is true, the Major did considerable pulling at the few hairs that could be seen, and his trunk contained no less than seventeen nostrums to make the beard grow. He had trusted in all, and been disappointed by every one. Some men would have taken to drinking. The Major buried his despair in another passion sion. He wore the finest clothes in the corps, and compressed his waist to an impossible size. Notwithstanding all this, he was a good and smart fellow, with the sole affectation of praising every thing German, and deprecating every thing American. 
               Lieutenant Geo. W. Dawson was a different man. Tall, thin, dark complexioned, and black-haired, American to the back bone. A born scoffer at every thing foreign. A little slow of comprehension, but tenacious of retaining an idea once comprehended. Scrupulous in fine manners that did not sit quite easy on him; firm of belief and trust where his honest heart had once placed confidence; and a lover of poetry, and especially of Tennyson, whom he could not always appreciate at the time, but worked out by degrees. 
               "What a fine morning," said Dawson-Americans discuss the weather more than any other nation-"there is nothing in the world to compare with our Indian summer, I believe." 
               "Except your chimneys," replied the Major. "Insufferably hot to the face, and cold to the back. Thus we have it now. Broiling at noon and freezing at night." 
               "You don't understand how to treat our chimneys, that's the difficulty. You want to sit in a warm high-backed chair, or stand with your back to the fire." 
               "Like Mr. Pickwick," said Welland. 
               "I wonder when we are going to move?" asked Schonherr. "No General in the world could wish for better weather to finish a campaign in. But the Americans are initiating quite a new science of war," he added, sneeringly. 
               "I suppose they are," returned Dawson. "And one that will knock spots out of the rest of the world, if you will permit me the expression." 
               "No doubt," laughed Schonherr. "I'll bet that fifty thousand French soldiers would finish this war in three months." 
               "What will you bet?" 
               "Whatever you please." 
               "Gentlemen," said Welland. "How are you going to decide?" 
               "Write to Nap. and let him send the troops," replied Dawson. "We invite competition, and we'll give them a chance." 
               "No," said Schonherr. "Seriously speaking, don't you see yourself that this is not a warlike nation? The men are not soldiers, but mechanics and farmers. The commanders are not Generals, but lawyers, merchants, dancing-masters, and what not. Does it not seem to you that it would have been better for Congress to hire out the job, and get the putting down of the rebellion done by contract? It would have been done cheaper and quicker." 
               "Let me tell you, Major, that we take pride in being citizens that know how to earn their living honestly in peace. If we are not able to be moved about like dead machines, as European armies are said to be, we can fight nevertheless for the maintenance tenance of our Government, even as we fought for its establishment with the greatest power of Europe. Your remarks are a little insulting, Major." 
               "Well sir," returned the Major, hotly. "We both wear swords. I will give you satisfaction. I'll take my straps off." 
               "If you mean by duel, Major, permit me to say that such a proposition is ridiculous. But if you'll take your straps off and insult me, I'll walk into you with my two fists, with all my heart." 
               "That is the way boors fight, not gentlemen," returned the other. "Will pistols suit you?" 
               "Nonsense," interrupted Welland. "Major, remember the articles of war. Slash away at the enemy, if your fighting impulses are so uncontrollable." 
               He gathered his reins, and cantered away. The others followed in silence. Bye and bye they came to a steep place, where they were compelled to walk their horses. Conversation recommenced. 
               "I do not deny, Lieutenant," said the Major, "that the Americans may in time become a great nation, but they have much to learn yet. At present they are like an overgrown boy full of conceit, and running into all sorts of extremes." 
               "Nor do I deny," rejoined the other, "that the Germans may become a great nation, but they have much to unlearn. At present they are like an old man, weakened in consequences of former excesses." 
                
               "Weakened? No. Lieutenant. Look at Germany! In art, science, poetry and civilization the first nation on the face of the earth! There is nothing in which it does not excel." 
               "Beer, especially," replied the other. "Not so?" 
               "Yes, beer. That beverage which is the only one that will teach you Americans moderation in drink. You do not understand the art of drinking. You step up to a bar, swallow a number of glasses of whiskey, and then go to roll in the gutter. You can not drink, and remain sober." 
               "We are not seasoned, as you are, who imbibe with your mother's milk." 
               "No, you are not capable of restraining yourselves. Consequently, a few of the better minded, acknowledging this incapacity, join temperance societies, and by keeping away from all manner of liquor, succeed in escaping the fate of drunkards. That is the reason." 
               "You seem to have investigated the matter." 
               "I have. It is your unnatural endeavor to hurry through life, that lies at the bottom of all. You want to save time, and swallow hastily and too much. Time saved at the bar is spent in the gutter." 
               "What has that to do with beer, Major." 
               "Beer will reform you. One can't drink enough to intoxicate, and drink it quick, unless one is a beast altogether, and such will get drunk any way." 
                
               They arrived in the neighborhood of Antietam battle field, and Welland thought of stopping at the house where General Rodman had died, to get a draught of water and a slight lunch. 
               Mr. Roebuck, the proprietor, was very happy to see them. He was a sturdy Maryland farmer, with sharp eyes, and a face tanned the color of leather. He called the girls, and the officers were served with what is called in the west "a square meal," consisting of meat, eggs, and cold beans. Cider was also set before them, and pies, accompanied by the inevitable "hunks" of damp cheese. 
               They ate of every thing with great relish; but neither Welland nor Schonherr would touch the pies, notwithstanding the solicitations of the young ladies, who had made them. Welland simply refused, but Schonherr said with energy: 
               "I want to live a little longer; so I never eat pies. I consider piecrust a deadly poison. It is slow, but sure. And it has the disadvantage of putting a man through all the tortures of dyspepsia, ere it kills him. If I want to commit suicide I'll take opium. No, ladies, offer pies to Americans, but not to civilized creatures." 
               When they came out, Mr. Roebuck followed them. 
               "Colonel," he said to Welland, "you've no objection to do the just thing, you know?" 
               "None in the world," Welland replied. "What can I do for you, my dear sir?" 
                
               "Just to sign a little paper, you know. It wont take you a minute." 
               "What sort of a paper? I must know the contents first." 
               "'Twould take too long to read it over, and you want to be going you know. So you can just sign it now. I am an honest man, you know." 
               "I don't care how honest you are, sir. I can't attach my signature to any paper unless I am acquainted with the contents." 
               "'Twould take too long to read it. I don't think you have time now, Colonel. I thought you'd do the just thing, you know." 
               "Leave it to another time then." 
               "No. I've got to have it now. I'll tell you what is in it, you know." 
               "Very well," and the officers sat down once more. 
               "Well, you see," said Roebuck, putting himself into position, "you know that they started a hospital in my house, and took whatever they could lay hands on you know, you know. Don't you?" 
               "Yes. They started a hospital here." 
               "And, those New Yorkers, with the red caps, put their camp into my garden you know, and all the chickens that was left by the hospital they caught and killed, you know, and marched off with those chickens stuck on their bayonets. I wouldn't begrudge any thing to the wounded, Colonel, but when healthy men steals your chickens, you know, you ought to have indemnity nity from Government. That's what's in the paper, you know." 
               "I'll certify to that," said Welland. "Is that all." 
               "Not exactly. There was three hundred chickens, you know, and twenty-five eggs which hens was a hatching. That makes three hundred and twenty-five, you know." 
               "All right. What else?" 
               "There was the palings all around my garden. Put up last spring, you know. Splendid chestnut palings. They was used for firewood by the red-caps, you know. I can't put them up for twice the amount now, Colonel." 
               "Is that all?" 
               "Well, there was the preserves. They was eaten up in the hospital you know. No telling, you know, what they was worth. Took any amount of sugar." 
               "Any thing more?" 
               "Yes, Colonel. The hams, you know, and the cider. There wasn't a bit left of either. I've had to buy hams and cider in Frederick two weeks ago. It's the first time, you know, in twenty years that I've bought a ham or a drop of cider. Always have my own, you know." 
               "Are you done. Mr. Roebuck?" 
               "Not quite. There was a lot of bedding spoilt, you know. My old woman can't get the blood stains out. The Government ought to pay for that, you know." 
               "I think it will be the shortest way to let me look over the list," said Welland, taking it from him, and stepping into the parlor. "Get pen and ink, and what I can't suscribe to I'll strike out." 
               After some objections, the farmer obeyed. Welland read:  
                      
                        1. Two nutmeg graters, nearly new, worth 
                        40c. 
                      
                      
                        2. The dog's collar, bought last spring, 
                        $1 00. 
                      
                      
                        3. A pair of saddlebags that would have lasted me ten years 
                        $3 00 
                      
                      
                        4. Twenty hams, each weighing 13 pounds at least, and worth 
                          
                      
                  
                
               "Why, Mr. Roebuck, their value is not given?" 
               "Well, Colonel, hams may rise, you know, and I am waiting you know, for their price to get up." 
               Welland read on. 
               Presently he put his pen through an item. 
               Mr. Roebuck groaned. Another was likewise stricken out. 
               "Don't be hard," he said. "I'm a poor man you know, and Government has got lots of money." 
               But more followed, and as each was stricken out, Mr. Roebuck gave utterance to dismal groans. 
               At last Welland affixed his certificate and signature to each page, and prepared to depart. 
               Mr. Roebuck was profuse in his thanks. 
               "We have finished this business nicely," he said, "and now all is settled except the meal, you know." 
               "What meal?" 
               "The meal you've just had, you know. Only a dollar a piece. Victuals is high, you know. That's it." 
               They mounted their horses. 
               "Good bye, gentlemen, and call again, you know. You have fine weather for your ride. God bless you, you know." 
               It was late in the evening when they entered Middletown, and they had no small difficulty in obtaining a lodging. The town was full of wounded, and every house was a hospital. Federals and confederates seemed on the easiest terms imaginable as they hobbled from one hospital to the other, and paid visits, or joined in amusements to pass time. When our friends had partaken of a good supper, Welland proceeded to the Provost Marshal's office, to obtain permission to see Tourtelotte, as well as to ascertain where he had been placed. He found a pleasant officer in charge who granted him the permission, but could not state where Tourtelotte was. A visit to the Medical Director had the same result. As it was late, he was advised to wait till morning, and then make the rounds of the hospitals, and inspect their registers. There was no choice but to follow this advice. Declining an invitation from the Provost Marshal to stay with him and make an evening of it. Welland returned to his quarters and went to bed, with Antonia's little book under his pillow and a heavy heart in his bosom. He desired to hear Tourtelotte's revelations, yet trembled at the result. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXVI. 
               NEXT morning Tourtelotte was found, and Welland proceeded at once to the hospital where he lay. It was a frame church with plenty of windows, surrounded by a pleasant green, and kept cool by shade trees. Welland saw the surgeon in charge; a fat pompous man, in the gray uniform of the confederate army. He sent an attendant with him to point out Tourtelotte. They walked into the cool vestry, with neat white-washed walls, and long windows opening on the lawn, where the rustling trees were alive with birds. The cots were set around the wall, and as they entered, Tourtelotte, with his arm in a sling, leaped up and cried: 
               "I knew I should see you, Louis. I am so glad you have come." He seized Welland's hand with eagerness, and pressed it with every sign of joy. 
               Welland was a little disconcerted by this cordial reception. It puzzled him. But he replied: 
               "After detaining you by every means in my power, Colonel, it was but courteous to look after your accommodations." 
               "Sit down. My cot is the only chair I can offer you." 
               "I am used to soldier's furniture, Colonel; no apologies." 
               "But why are you so formal, Louis? I am so very glad to see you, and I have been so dreadfully bored since my capture, that I must resume the terms of our early friendship. Unless," he added, haughtily, "the federal Colonel thinks it degrading to be on intimate terms with a confederate officer." 
               "No, Frank," replied Welland. "You are a gentleman, and I would consider you an equal, no matter under what circumstances I met you. If I have not at once resumed the language of our early friendship, it is because I can not forget the manner of my exit from Tennessee, and by whose tools was pursued." 
               "Not with my knowledge, Louis, I swear to you. You do me injustice." 
               "I am glad to hear it. What has become of the scamp?" 
               "Do you mean Hazelton?" 
               "Yes, though Hassel is his real name." 
               "I suppose he has changed it again before this. He began as Quartermaster of my regiment, but being soon detected in some thievery, saved his neck by entering into the secret service corps." 
               "As a detective? Is that what you do with thieves?" 
               "A detective after a fashion. He finds out your plans for our Generals. Comprenez vous?" 
               "Not quite. You don't mean that he has turned spy?" 
               "Exactly. But you will not make use of this, parole d'honneur." 
               "I will not. Great God, what a disgrace!" 
                
               "Don't pity him. There are some people rascals from the moment of their birth. As the old Puritans would say: predestined to the pit. He is one of them. Let him worry through life, and the sooner he ends, the less mischief will he do." 
               "I suppose God had some special purpose in endowing such a nature with many talents. To us it is mysterious." 
               "As if God had created him!-No, men have made him. His ancestry, drifting toward evil in one way or another, developed those cells in their brain, which, when produced together, dictate the sentiments that make up the nature of a scoundrel. He has but followed the inevitable laws of his nature in becoming one. He could not help it." 
               "I don't mean to discuss that question, Frank, but whether he could help it or not, he will be hanged, when caught. And justly too. The tiger can not help being a tiger, yet society makes chase upon him." 
               "You claim to have won a battle at Antietam, I believe," said Tourtelotte. 
               "We have won a battle there," replied Welland. "Lee has retreated into Virginia. Do you often hear from our Tennessee friends?" 
               "Do you mean the Goldmans? They are all well, even including Mr. Sellington Sharp, that queer genius. Charley is in my regiment, and a brave officer he is." 
               "Ah!" After reflecting for a moment or two, Welland proposed that Tourtelotte should step out with him and take a stroll on the green, if his wound would permit it. Tourtelotte gladly accepted the proposal, and making a sling of an old silk handkerchief, suspended his arm by it, and followed the other. Welland led the way to the rear of the hospital, and there they walked up and down under the rustling trees, and neither spoke a word for full five minutes. A sort of embarrassment had succeeded their first free intercourse. Both felt that a subject must be alluded to, which might prove difficult to manage. At last Tourtelotte, with the recklessness of his nature, seized the bull by the horns. 
               "If there, were nothing else," he said, "to make us valiant and enduring in this war, the enthusiasm of our ladies would suffice to do so. You can not imagine how intensely patriotic the ladies of the South are. Our light pales before their fire. We are but the 'messengers of their wrath.'" 
               "I have heard of this," replied Welland. 
               "Take Antonia Goldman for instance," resumed the other. "You remember Miss Goldman? She was the quietest and most reserved of girls before this. Well, sir, she is continually at work now for the cause. That young lady, God bless her, presented a flag to my regiment, and made a speech on the occasion that would have poured fire into the veins of an ice-bear. I believe that she would be found ready to lay her life down at any moment were it required for the good of the South." 
                
               "Miss Goldman is capable of sacrificing herself for a great idea," replied Welland. "Happy knights that fight for the favor of such ladies!" 
               "Happy, indeed," replied Tourtelotte. "What more can one desire than to fight for one's dearest interests, with the hope of calling the fairest lady wife, when the palm of victory is won." 
               Welland grew rather pale. "Do you mean Miss Goldman? Is that the arrangement?" 
               "It is. Excuse me. I believe you had some aspirations in that quarter, but of course you gave up every hope when you joined the army of our enemies." 
               "After being sent out of Tennessee in so amiable a manner." replied Welland, bitterly. "I wish you joy." 
               "Thank you. Of course you never could entertain serious views in regard to Antonia. That was out of the question." 
               "Why?" asked Welland, haughtily. 
               Tourtelotte grew embarrassed and said: "I don't know. It seemed to me that your political views were of a shade precluding the idea of settlement in the South." 
               "Let us drop the subject," resumed Welland. "You have told me that Miss Goldman was to be your bride at the conclusion of this war, and I have wished you joy. Whatever my private feelings are, or have been, is of no moment now. I thank you for the intelligence. Can I do any thing for you in the way of accommodations?" 
                
               "I am very comfortable at present, but I fear they are going to remove me before long." 
               "Whenever my influence can make captivity more endurable, or assist in your speedy exchange, pray command me. Here is my address. And now, do not be offended if I offer to be your banker during the time you stay in the North. I should expect as much of you were I a prisoner in the South, and should certainly take advantage of it." 
               "You are a noble fellow. Louis, let not love for a woman come between you and me. Let us remain friends, true friends. You liked Antonia Goldman, I love her deeply. If she will be my wife I shall thank God for it. But even then I should taste happiness with regret, had I lost your affection in striving for it." 
               "You are an enthusiast, Frank. I do not think you know how deep my feelings are, and how easily swayed your own heart is. Isn't there a great deal of surface, storm and sunshine in your bosom, which never penetrates to the vital depths below?" 
               "I believe there is. No one but a German could expect a single feeling to carry away a man entirely. Life is so rich, that man can not anchor his soul on one object alone. Sometimes this one cable parts, and if there are no other resources, the game its lost." 
               "That's a confusion of metaphors. However ever, your theory of life may be the happier one. I believe it is." 
               "Don't call it mine. It is the theory of the French. And every man of leisure, or of pleasure, which amounts to the same thing, is a Frenchman at some period of his life. They rave on love, but do not neglect at the same time to order and enjoy the nicest little dinners, and to study the arrangement of their dress, and take delight in a costume that becomes fashionable. They philosophise on beauty, virtue, simplicity, but are very careful to know what dowry a girl will have ere they propose. They attach their heart with equal strength to all the pleasures and delights of life-and if they fail to secure any single one, enough remain to console them for the loss. That is not a bad theory of life? N'est pas?" 
               "You say: they attach themselves with equal strength to many objects in life. The term is ill-chosen. Equal weakness is better. For depth and sincerity they have profusion and triviality. Is it better to fritter away your soul on a number of objects, than to attach yourself permanently and securely to a single one? Is universality preferable to thoroughness? I believe not. It may be comfortable to console one's-self for the loss of a friend by a good dinner, and for the loss of a lady, by a dashingly cut garment. But I would rather not be the friend whose affection is ranked with cotelettes de veau, or the lady whose heart is prized with the products of the tailor." 
               "But every man passes through periods of life when he adopts these French views, for the time at least, if not for good." 
               "That may be. Every man is a fool, not once in his life but many times. But I am with the Germans, rather a fool on the other side of the question, and would say with Montrose: 
                      
                        "He either fears his fate too much, 
                        Or his deserts are small, 
                        Who dares not put it to the touch, 
                        To win or lose it all." 
                     
                  
                
               After a while, Welland took his leave. He insisted on providing Tourtelotte with funds, to serve him in case of necessity, and exacted a promise that he would apply to him if his services could be of any avail. 
               On the ride to camp, while Major Schonherr and Lieutenant Damson talked and quarreled, Welland considered the situation. He was again adrift. Antonia had abandoned him and chosen another. Why? He knew not. Shocked as he was at her fickleness, he imputed it to no mean motive. Without inveighing especially against her, he recapitulated all the charges that are in such cases made against the, sex. Unstable as water, and so forth, were the compliments with which he loaded in spirit the fair portion of humanity. Thoughts of Emma Reichenau mingled in this strain, and Welland concluded his train of thoughts, as good men usually do, by highly complimenting the male sex generally, and himself particularly on their superior stability, constancy, and depth of feeling. On the whole, he bore Tourtelotte's revelation with equanimity. He did not resolve, as heroes of romances do, to take the occasion of the next battle, dash into the thickest, be cut down, and die with the words: "Farewell Antonia," on his lips; nor did he swear, as very young men might, that he would perform prodigies of valor, rise to the grade of Major General, and by his station and renown shame the fickle beauty into eternal regrets and repentance. He simply recognized the necessity of opening another tomb in his heart, burying the old love, setting it a monument, and beginning life anew on the remains of the old life. This implied work and wrestling, and Welland shunned it not. He wrestled and worked, and finally believed that he had given up Antonia for good and all. He found that he would have to rely on the requirements of his office as Colonel, for abstraction from the regrets which weighed down his heart. But still he wore Kinkel's "Otto" in his breast-pocket, and still lapsed into moods, when the gray pony and sunny curls were conjured up by imagination, and not banished by judgment. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXXVII. 
               IT was shortly after the first battle of Fredericksburg. Encompassed by Virginia mud lay the army of the Potomac. Far and wide around the little village of Falmouth extended the camp, and their white triangular tents rose from the dark red soil in countless profusion. For miles in the vicinity, the woods had fallen victims to the necessities of the army, and the earth looked bare and angry with its unshaded and unconcealed face of mud. 
               The Virginia mud is a peculiar institution. Examined in small quantities it does not seem to justify the phillipics directed against it. Soft, fatty, and of a dark red color, which it owes to a generous admixture of loam, it adheres to whatever it comes in contact with. It retains moisture for a long time, but when dry forms brittle lumps, which at a touch fall into sharp, hard-baked fragments, or resolve into powder. Looked at as a whole, it realizes the qualities which any of the larger planets would exercise toward a stray human being, whom we might fancy cast away upon their surface. It grasps the foot that falls upon it. It chains the horse, and stops the revolutions of the wheel. You can not proceed but by dislodging it. You can not raise your limb but by raising with it the circumambient mud. At each step great muscular exertion is required. At each movement, you make your road as you proceed. You cleave like a plow, and run it your furrow. At times there is a relief. Soft places occur. Holes where the fund of water accumulated, renders the mud thin. They do not show much on the surface. Unawares you place your foot upon them, and go in above the knee. Slowly you withdraw, and streams of loamy fluid descend from your clothes in graceful rills. Often have I seen these holes filled up with beans, ere a wagon train could venture to pass over them. Where pine sprigs are inaccessible, beans seem best fitted to mend Virginia roads. 
               This cruel unrelenting mud, which, like the harpias of old, clung to the heels of its victims, kept both armies in the toils for the greater part of the winter. The federals on the left bank of the Rappahannock, and the confederates on the right. Up and down the stream, stretched the long picket lines, and the soldiers on their solitary guard exchanged many a word of greeting and kindness, and sometimes argument with their foes on the opposite shore. In the headquarters of both armies plans were hatched, every week a new one, for crossing the river and destroying the enemy. But mud being an equal enemy to both, always managed to frustrate these schemes, if its existence did not render them untenable from the first. Still, there was a system of active espionage engendered by this scheming and counter-scheming, which was believed to be necessary in order to guard the respective armies from a surprise. No General felt his papers safe when he left his tent. If they escaped the impertinent handling of reporters, spies were sure to get hold of them, and secure the intelligence contained. A strict detective force was organized in consequence and Gen. Burnside's Provost Marshal General grew especially active in this portion of his duties. New York rogues were brought on and set upon the track. And, be it remarked, he who succeeds in escaping detection by a thorough bred New York rogue, may hope to pull the wool over Satan's eyes, and swindle himself into the kingdom of heaven. 
               Welland's regiment lay near the center of the camp, about a mile and a half from the river. The men had built small chimneys of pine slats and mud, which rose a few feet above the ridge of their shelter tents, and where they nursed themselves when off duty at the side of mean little fires. The officers, more ambitious, reared fire-places of logs and mud, with a succession of barrels to serve as chimneys. The inflammable character of these forbid the attempt to light a hearty fire. They would allow but a moderate blaze. 
               The Surgeon of the regiment was a sharer of Col. Welland's tent in those times of economical arrangements. Nor was this unpleasant; on the contrary, finding an agreeable young man well read in science, in this medical officer, Welland rather enjoyed his company. 
               We look in upon them on a January evening. The tent is an ordinary wall tent. On either side stands a bunk. That of the Surgeon is low and constructed of a hospital stretcher. The Colonel's is higher. Four short poles, with forked tops, are stuck into the ground, and their forks support two long sticks. Upon these are laid or nailed a number of barrel staves, upholding a bag full of corn-shucks, which represents a luxurious camp mattress. These bunks are the only seats in the tent. One side of the back wall is ripped up and folded back to disclose an abortive attempt at a fire-place. The other is occupied by a mess chest, the lid of which serves the purposes of a dining table, writing desk, easy chair and toilet stand. Each man's valise is under his bunk, and the swords, sashes, and other paraphernalia hang on the tent pole by nails. A couple of tallow candles in bayonets reversed, which stick, one in the ground, and the other in the log above the fire-place, illuminate the tent. 
               We have forgotten to mention one article: to stove. It was the jewel of the tent furniture. The Surgeon, by hook or by crook, had managed to "make" this stove from the Hospital Department, and it was at once his darling and his pride. Built of thin sheet iron, easy to heat and quick to grow cold, small and set on three insecure stumpy legs, it occupied the center of the tent, a little to the right. An emaciated pipe rose straight up, and escaped through a rip in the roof of the tent. This pipe was fluted with stripes of rust, where the rain had run down and left its mark. 
               It was evening, and both tallow candles dispensed light from the elevation of their bayonet holders. Welland was reading a volume of Hugo's "Les Miserables," then quite new, while the Surgeon indited letters, the portfolio on his knees doing duty as desk. The wind entering by the door made the candles flare, shook the walls, and caused the swords and belts to vibrate with a gentle motion. From without, the regular step of the Sentinel on his beat could be heard, with the sharp short reports of tent-flies, lifted by the wind, and then suddenly dashed against the linen roofs. 
               "Doctor, it is getting cold," said Welland, whose comfortable position, stretched out on his bunk, made him disinclined to move. 
               "Hm? Aye, aye. What did you say, Colonel?" inquired the medical man, rousing himself. 
               "Have you been asleep over your letter? I believe you have. I think it is getting cold, doctor." 
               The doctor put out his hand to test the temperature. 
               "Your perceptive faculties are unimpaired, Colonel," he replied, and continued his letter. 
                
               Welland laughed. "Do have some mercy with my laziness," he said, "and look to the fire." 
               "That stove needs more nursing than a baby," replied the doctor, and rose to attend to it. 
               He opened the stove, and saw a number of live coals. Then he fumbled under it and brought forth a solitary stick of wood. It was a forked stick, and looked as if it might pass through the stove-door without hindrance. The doctor tried it, but in vain. He turned it this way and that, but it wouldn't go. He lifted the platters from the top, endeavored to insert it from that direction, but failed again, notwithstanding the assistance given by his hand from below. It came very near passing, but did not. Finally the doctor burned his hand, and with an oath, dashed the stick down. 
               "Why, why," said Welland, soothingly, "where are your eyes, doctor? Don't you see the label? That's the 'gay deceiver!'" 
               This stick, it seems, had frequently foiled their efforts to insert it into the stove, and because it always looked as if it might pass, yet never did, and they were sure to try whenever the wood was out, Welland had labeled it "the gay deceiver." 
               So they bawled for Ned. 
               Ned appeared, winking with his sleepy eyes. 
               "Wood!" cried both. "Bring a number of sticks." 
                
               "There aint no wood, Kurnel," replied the negro. 
               "Go to the hospital," said the Surgeon. "You'll find some there." 
               So he brought it, and the doctor attempted to build up a fire. The coals were almost dead. With bits of paper and chips of wood he coaxed the poor flame, and blew and puffed until the tent was full of smoke, and the Colonel leaped up to see to the matter himself. The pine sticks brought by Ned were green, and yielded more smoke than flame. With infinite art and no end of anxiety they nursed the poor fire up between them, until it had reached a promising condition. Then suddenly, it was taken with an incurable relapse, and subsided. They looked at each other in comic despair. 
               "I'm not going to try again," said the doctor. "I wish the d-- would carry off this confounded stove." 
               "And leave us in the cold, doctor. Taps have sounded. Let's go to bed like good soldiers." 
               "It's confounded early, but I can't write in the cold. I wonder whether the fireplace would bear an attempt?" 
               "Don't try. There's quite smoke enough in this tent." 
               "Well, to bed be it then." He undressed and wrapped himself in his blankets. "Colonel, will you have a quinine pill, before going to sleep?" he asked, politely extending tending a pill box, from which he had just helped himself to a couple. 
               "No, thank you," replied Welland, undressing. 
               "Good night." 
               "Good night." 
               They went to sleep. Quiet reigned in the tent. The tallow candles were extinguished, and the door tied up well, admitted no gleam of light from without. Now the stove saw its time. Slyly and cunningly it raised a draft, and worked until the coals were all aglow, and the bits of paper and chips in a bright blaze. Presently there was a great roar in it. Welland and the doctor raised their heads simultaneously. It was red hot. The pipe gleamed with a dusky glow. The cloth of the roof where it escaped was beginning to burn. The blankets on both bunks were singed. A smell of burnt wool pervaded the tent, and the great red glare of the stove illuminated every thing. 
               "As usual!" cried the doctor. "Waited till we were asleep, and then tried to burn us out. Oh, confounded stove!" 
               And he leaped up, and dragged the pail from its hiding place. 
               "No water! We shall have the tent afire over our heads in a minute, Colonel. Ned! Ned! Ned, I say!" 
               The servant replied: "Here!" a good distance off. 
               "Bring water! Water! Water!" 
                
               Ned came at a slow trot with a pailful from the kitchen. 
               Now began a scene of activity. Ladleful after ladleful of water was thrown upon that place, where the pipe came in contact with the roof of the tent, where ominous black spots indicated the danger. Then several ladlesful were poured into the stove. But in vain. The flames seemed only to grow livelier. Red and glowing, the malicious little monster withstood all attempts to soothe it; withstood, until the fuel it held was consumed; and only then permitted the two officers to return to their beds with the assurance of finding a roof over their head in the morning. 
               "Good night." 
               "Good night, again." 
               There is a sound on the road, which causes every soldier and officer to start. The sound of a horse which comes galloping from the direction of headquarters. Perhaps it brings marching orders. Perhaps it is a summons to prepare for fight. Or it may be only an announcement of an inspection. Who knows? 
               The horse approaches, and the rider is challenged. He gives the countersign, and dismounts in front of the Colonel's tent. 
               In a moment every tent is opened, and anxious faces peer out. The moon is bright, and the Sentinels stop on their beat to catch the import of the orders. The Colonel throws open his tent, and meets the Orderly from headquarters. It is a young soldier. He has fastened his horse to a stake, and salutes, with the question: "Colonel Welland?" 
               "Step in," replied Welland, returning the salute. 
               He enters, and delivers a paper, one end of which protruded from the breast of his jacket. It is in an envelope from the Provost Marshal's office, and the words "Official Business," in the left hand corner, are struck out. Welland opened it, and on request returned the envelope to the Orderly with his signature, as a receipt. He galloped off, and the camp was left in expectation. Most of the officers had dressed, and awaited the call of the drum to assemble at the Colonel's quarters. In fact, the rumors of another attack, which Burnside designed to make upon the heights of Fredericksburg, induced all to believe that it was "marching orders," which the Colonel had received. 
               But it was not. Welland glanced over the missive in surprise. It ran thus: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           "LOUIS WELLAND:-I don't know whether you will permit me to address you as a friend, or even as an acquaintance, after what has passed between us in Tennessee. Nor do I care much. I am in a condition at present, in which the opinion of men is highly indifferent to me. The knife is at my throat. The waters are closing over me. The earth bids me good bye. In short, I am sentenced to death, and am not sorry to take leave of this miserable life, which has granted me nothing but sorrows, and left me to struggle for the joys I desired. Do not imagine that I apply for your intercession. It would do no good, and having brought myself to the idea that I must die, I do not think that I would accept it. Perhaps you know that I have been convicted of serving as a confederate spy. If not, it makes no difference. We are beyond the dark ages when it was thought dishonorable to serve one's cause in this manner. We have reached a standpoint, when it is acknowledged that the spy is a necessity, and that the greatest courage, the most absolute coolness, and a certain degree of genius, are required to fill that office successfully. You will not then, with the prejudice of exploded systems of chivalric warfare, think the worse of me for having served as a spy. 
                           "I was careless, and have been discovered. Day after to-morrow I shall pay the penalty of my carelessness. They will shoot me. And though the transit may be unpleasant, yet I yearn for that perfect oblivion and rest which must follow dissolution. I am eager to get rid of this spirit, which gives us so much trouble and so little pleasure, and to exist again as part of the inert, spiritless vegetable or mineral constituents of this globe. It was a hard wrench to make up my mind to this fact, that it must be. But now, having gotten over that, I look with equanimity on the coming pang, and the peace that will succeed it. 
                           "Louis Welland, I want to see you. I must entrust papers to you that no one else can take charge of. I have wronged many during my life, and as their wrongs can no longer benefit me, it is perhaps as well that I should endeavor to right them in some measure, before I die. If, therefore, you do not come to see me on my own account, I ask you to come for the sake of those to whom I intend to make reparation. 
                           "But, I hope that you will come for my own sake too. Remember those years we passed together at University; remember our joyous and happy youth; remember how adverse fate has been to me, and above all, remember that I am a countryman of yours. I have much to say, that I can not write. The Provost Marshal has promised to send this at once so I shall expect you to-morrow. Until then, remember, I wait, hopefully trusting to your good nature and humanity. 
                           
                              HASSEL."
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               Welland laid the letter down, and became aware of a number of expectant eyes peeping in at the tent door. When they saw themselves discovered, a respectful scratch at the tent cloth bespoke their desire to enter. 
               "Come in," said the Colonel. 
               Major Schonherr appeared at the head of a number of other officers. 
               "Any orders, sir?" he inquired, respectfully. 
               "None," replied Welland, and they dispersed joyfully. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXVIII. 
               NEXT morning, Welland rode to the army headquarters, and entered the Provost Marshal's office. He found that Hassel was convicted not only of being a spy but also a deserter. It appeared that, for the purpose of gaining intelligence with greater ease, he had enlisted in the United States service, and thus the second charge was added to the first. His case was hopeless. He must die on the morrow, unless executive tive clemency interfered, which did not seem probable. The Provost Marshal had no hesitation in permitting Welland to see him, or to extend his interview to any length of time. He gave him an order to that effect, and told one of his clerks to direct the Colonel to the place where the prisoner was secured. 
               It was a tent at a little distance from headquarters, and a couple of soldiers were on guard, one on either side. The prisoner, after sentence had been pronounced, was separated from the others, who were in a log cabin, and placed in this tent by himself. The officer of the guard was summoned, and having inspected the Marshal's order, admitted Welland to the prisoner. 
               Hassel was seated on a heap of corn husks in the corner, with a couple of blankets thrown over him. His wrists were handcuffed, and his ancles chained together. He arose with some difficulty, and greeted Welland. 
               "I have no seat to offer you, Colonel," he said. "You see that they endeavor to disenchant me with this life, by depriving me of its conveniences. A correct idea in view of my condition; n'est pas?" 
               "Hassel," replied Welland, with deep feeling, "I can not enter in your frivolous mood. It is a sad matter for me to see any one condemned to an untimely end, and how much more when that one has possessed my esteem, and even friendship, in bygone days. To die, and for such crimes!" 
                
               "Have you come here to preach, Louis Welland? You have always been inclined that way." 
               "I have come to see whether I could serve you." 
               "And you begin by endeavoring to disturb my equanimity, to attack my composure, and my contentment with my lot! What is the use of bewailing the past? No God can undo it." 
               "But God can forgive it, if true repentance follow." 
               "Are you a parson? I thought you were a Jew?" 
               "I am a believe in God and his justice." 
               "Would you have me go down on my knees then and snivel, and protest that I am sorry for trying to enjoy life at the expense of the rich and the powerful, whom I cheated or robbed? Never. I am not sorry, and would continue to wage the war against them, were I to live longer." 
               "An unequal warfare you have found it, taking up arms against society, truth, justice and order." 
               "I don't care. I have lived well, and society has felt my arm, more than once." 
               "As the buffalo feels the fly." 
               "Aye, and a single fly can sting him to madness. But there are a thousand preying on his carcass." 
               "This is mere folly. Remember, your hours are numbered, Hassel." 
               "I did not want a monitor to remind me of that. But it is the fashion with you so-called called good men never to feel satisfied, unless you make the unfortunate appreciate the full weight of their misery. It has always been so. With your pretended pity you touch the raws of their pride. With your sympathy you recall their sorrows and misfortunes. With your advice you goad them to madness." 
               "Hassel, recover yourself. I have only spoken in kindness." 
               "Oh, it is all done in kindness! Why don't you say: Hassel, you should have been more phlegmatic, or less passionate, or of a more virtuous disposition, and you would not have come to this! You might as well demand: why don't you have black eyes, or golden hair? It is folly to reproach, a greater folly to regret, and the greatest folly to advise. Can a man with shorter legs make the same stride that you do? Can a person with weaker arms lift the same weight? How can you expect one of a totally different character to follow the rules you have chalked out for yourself?" 
               "Do not let us discuss social questions here." 
               "Why not? I am in the proper mood. I have said farewell to life, and may speak as one out of his coffin. The pretenses of society do not exist for me any longer. I see it naked in all its hideousness. But you dislike these discussions. You always bend to the powers that be. You are an aristocrat, Welland, socially and religiously." 
                
               "Religiously?" inquired the other, resolved to indulge him in his present mood. 
               "Yes, religiously. Your God is a God of aristocrats. He will only look at those with money in their pockets. Your religion is a system to protect the rich. Your virtues are qualities that are natural to the wealthy and a consequence of wealth. Who is ever tempted to steal? Not the millionaire, but the starving beggar. So you usher the one into a heaven full of whining angels, for keeping a law he has never felt tempted to break, and you lock the other, with his craving stomach and empty pocket, into jail in this world, and plunge him in hell-fire in the next. That is your religion, your justice, your God." 
               "Do not blaspheme. You will have to meet him ere long." 
               "And you never cease reminding me of it, as if that could strengthen your case! But you are mistaken. You comfort yourself with the idea that as soon as my body has ceased to breathe, there will be a file of angels ready, with flaming swords, to arrest, what you call, my spirit, and tug it up to a great bar of justice, where your God sits frowning with a golden crown on his head, and a scepter of fire in his hand. And he will deliver me over to a hairy devil with horns and tail, who presently immerses me into burning pitch. While you, it you die, as even such perfection must, will be convoyed up by sniveling cherubim, and lapped in soft clouds, and fed with nectar and ambrosia. But I assure you that I will cease to live, cease to be conscious of existence, and exist only as dead matter, after the officer has commanded 'fire' to-morrow morning at ten." 
               "This is terrible. Hassel, recollect you are sporting with the highest hopes of the human heart. It is awful to hear a man on the threshold of eternity talk as you do." 
               "Does it shock you? 'Twould be bad doctrine for you perhaps, 'tis good for me. And, moreover, it is true. If not, why don't you argue with me?" 
               "There is no time for argument. You have only time for faith. Believe, you can. The argument must spring out of your own heart. And surely, Hassel, a heart that has entertained aspirations so high, and felt a love so ardent and pure, a heart that has been true and noble, can not degenerate so far as to lose entirely its conviction of a higher being, a creator, and sustainer. This conviction is inherent in every being--" 
               "For God's sake-no, I mean for the d-'s sake-for-Welland, stop speaking in this strain! My conviction of the folly and falseness of all religious doctrines is too deeply rooted, too firmly set to be torn up by your words. All you may succeed in is throwing doubts into a mind comparatively at peace, and embittering the last moments of a man who has done with this world and does not believe in any other." 
                
               "But I conceive it to be my duty--" resumed Welland. 
               "To make me miserable," interrupted Hassel. 
               "No. Is it misery, when I assure a man who expects perfect annihilation, that there is life for him beyond the grave? When I tell a soul that believes itself abandoned, cast away in the universe like a flickering flame, that there is a loving God who watches it, feels for it, pities it, and will redeem it? Do not expect a stern judge, but a loving father. Do not expect punishment, but pity that you can not enter into the perfection of angels. Only rouse yourself to the idea. Does not every thing high and noble in you respond to the assurance that there is a Father and a God above us?" 
               "No, it does not," returned Hassel, bluntly. "If I could entertain such a belief it would fill me with burning hatred, with deep anger against that being. Why, if He is so just and wise, did He give me these passions, these longings, these capacities for evil? Why did He, as if the wicked talents of my brain were not sufficient, spur me on in the path of sin by misfortune, and unmerited disgrace? And if He wished me to be a scoundrel, why did He fetter me by a turn for foolish hesitation, which men call conscience, and which spoiled most of my plans. And now I am to be accountable for the results, which were necessarily worked out by the cells of a brain that I received, but did not create? Bosh. Welland, you may make your fortune as a preacher. As for myself, I respectfully decline your services in that capacity. I have wished to see you on another score than that of my soul and salvation." 
               "Well, Hassel, I am ready to serve you." 
               "Thanks. When I was arrested, all my papers were seized. Some have no relation to the business I followed. I proved this to the Provost Marshal, and he returned them to me. I have added others, chiefly depositions made by me and sworn to before the Provost Marshal. They are all in this envelope. They are addressed to the minister of justice of the kingdom of Bavaria. Will you attend to their being sent through the proper channels? I will receive your assurance to that effect as a last favor." 
               "They shall go. I will attend to them." 
               "And now, Welland, if ever you should see-" 
               "I should see-" 
               "Ernestine! Oh, how I loved her! If she had loved me with equal ardor, it might have been different." 
               "Perhaps. What am I to do?" 
               "Tell her I died in battle. And my parents-" 
               "Your parents?" 
               "They are not worthy to be remembered. Tell them I forgot that I ever possessed parents." 
                
               "Will you send such a message?" 
               "I will. Let the old man rejoice in his king, to whom he has sacrificed his son. As for me, I also have sacrificed my parents to liberty, and I begin to understand the feelings of those, who denounced their fathers in the reign of terror, and escorted them to the guillotine." 
               "This is terrible. Farewell, Hassel. I am going." 
               "You merely imitate every one else in leaving me; I can not complain of you. Yet, Louis, let us part in a kindly spirit, as we will probably never see each other again. Let me return to dust to-morrow, and do you ascend to heaven when your time comes-that should not stand between us now. Good bye, Louis, good bye, and think of me sometimes, think of me as a student." 
               Welland, with tears in his eyes, embraced the prisoner, and they parted for ever. For ever? Who shall say? The mercy of the Lord is infinite. 
               Next morning three regiments were marched out, and arranged so as to form three sides of a square. They all faced inward. The fourth side was open, and many looked thither with a shudder. At last a solemn cortege approached. Some drummers in advance with muffled drums. Then a detachment of infantry with pale resolute faces. And at last an ambulance containing a coffin, the prisoner, and a clergyman. These were surrounded and followed by a cavalry guard. Arrived at the fourth side of the square, the ambulance stopped. The coffin was taken out and placed upon the ground. The prisoner and the chaplain dismounted. The latter again attempted to urge repentance and faith with the former, and for the fiftieth time was met with scorn and ridicule. The detachment was marched into the square a little distance, and then fronted upon the prisoner. They took his coat off, and tied his hands. Then they seated him upon his coffin, and put a bandage over his eyes. 
               "Officer," he said, "be steady! Men, aim well! I don't want to be killed at second hand. Those that can shoot may aim at my head. The rest should make my breast their mark. Is it all ready?" 
               No, it was not. The men were commanded "Shoulder arms!" and then the chaplain stepped forward and offered up a long prayer. He was fervent and devout, but the prisoner interrupted him by frequent sounds of disgust. 
               "They keep me waiting," he said, "I shall catch cold." 
               The chaplain retired. Then followed an awful pause. Every eye flinched, and every face was pale. It is terrible thus to witness the deliberate destruction of a human being. It is like being killed one's self. 
               Suddenly the voice of the officer rang out: "Ready! Aim! Fire!" and Hassel's body fell back covered with blood. 
                
               The surgeons went up and examined it. Life was extinct. Two balls had penetrated the brain and three the chest. Any single one of them would have sufficed. Military justice was satisfied. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIX. 
               IN Claiborne County it was very quiet.-The young men had all gone to war. There was no business, and little effort to cultivate the land. No one knew but the Union troops should occupy the country before the crops could be gathered. And that the Union troops did respect private property was an opinion not much encouraged in the South. People went about in a listless manner, planting enough to keep their families and negroes, and taking interest in nothing else but news from the seat of war. 
               At Pineland the family had grown very quiet also, though this quiet was occasionally broken by stormy scenes. Mrs. Goldman could not forget that Madame la Generale had encouraged Charles to enter the service, and that her boy exposed his life daily and hourly for principles and views that were perfectly indifferent to her. On the other, Madame la Generale hesitated not to rebuke the craven spirit of her niece in bitter terms. Mr. Goldman had bad luck as peacemaker, as a quiet phlegmatic man is apt to have when endeavoring to pacify too high-spirited females. Between Antonia and Mr. Sharp confidence was impaired. He rarely conversed with her now in private, and she was reserved and reticent when these occasions occurred. Except his daily game of cards with Madame la Generale, he did not come much in contact with the family. He had not ceased to cultivate the estate, although his vexations were many. The young horses were taken for the army, and confederate scrip, in which he had lost faith, paid to him in remuneration. The crops were seized by military orders, or assessed highly in kind. There was no safety, no settled condition of matters. People exchanged money in the value of which they did not believe, and that was enough to disorganize society. For if money is the root of evil, it is also the root of order, and one might almost say life, in the social system of the present day. A reliable medium of exchange is the sine qua non of a civilized condition of affairs. 
               Antonia dismounted from her pony in front of the house, and entered the parlor. Mrs. Waddlekins and Mrs. Armistead were spending the afternoon at Pineland. After greetings had been exchanged, there was a general question of whether she had come from town. 
               "I have," replied Antonia, "and there is news." 
               "From the army? What is it? A battle?" asked Mrs. Armistead, eagerly, while Mrs. Goldman turned pale. 
               "There was no news when I left," said Mrs. Waddlekins. "It must have come since." 
               "I heard it at the Mayor's house," replied Antonia. "No battle. Only the Yankees are coming to Tennessee." 
               "To these parts?" asked Mrs. Waddlekins. "We shall resist them." 
               "An army corps is coming," continued Antonia, "under the command of Burnside." 
               "We shall provide another Fredericksburg for him," said Mrs. Waddlekins, grandiloquently. "Let them come with their beaten commanders! The women of Tennessee will be sufficient to put them to flight." She arose, and extended her parasol in the manner of Washington holding his sword on the picture. She succeeded in looking so formidable in this attitude, that it would have required a bold man to attack, and a still bolder to have taken her. 
               "Are they making any preparations to resist?" inquired Mrs. Armistead. "Is not the home guard going to fight?" 
               "What?" cried Madame la Generale. "That undisciplined, drunken, ridiculous canaille which you call home guard fight? Who is to be their leader? I look about me. Where is the military genius? And if there were, could he do any thing with the miserable mob you call home guard?" 
               "Your language is strong, Madame," said Mrs. Waddlekins. "We have not the liveried myrmidons of tyranny which you may have seen in France, but we can fight for our homes and hearth-stones nevertheless, and we will die in defense of them." 
               Madame replied by a shrug of her sharp old shoulders and a contemptuous twitch of the lip. 
               "But you are old, Madame," resumed Mrs. Waddlekins, with irritation, "and we can bear with your opinions." 
               "Old enough," returned the other; "and still not much older than you." 
               "What an idea," cried Mrs. Waddlekins. "It is evident that your memory is failing, my poor, dear Madame." 
               "On the contrary, it is the most excellent in the world; for I still remember the first appearance of certain dresses that must have been made ages ago." 
               It was evident that she alluded to the black satin, and Mrs. Waddlekins blushed painfully. 
               "If so," she returned, "it should go further back than that, and remind you that if certain families may not now be fortune's favorites, they have been once; the recollection that their wealth was sacrificed for a great purpose, and that our greatest men were their friends is all that remains to them, it is true." 
               "A thousand pardons," said Madame. "I am an irritable old woman, and am sorry to have offended you. You can not imagine how my temper is roused," she added, in a whisper, "by Sarah. A thousand times daily she blames me for Charles being in the army. As if he could have staid at home!" she raised her eyes and hands to denote the utter futility of such an expectation. "Charles had to go. I comprehended that. He comprehended it. Antonia comprehended it. But Sarah is dull. She is unfortunately not only a mother, but a goose." 
               "Orders have been received," Antonia further reported, "that no resistance is to be made. All the companies of the home guard, that are fit for service, must report at Knoxville. In the country it is recommended that the grain be secreted, and the valuables. Otherwise we are to remain quiet." 
               "And it is the most reasonable plan," said Madame. "Armies must defend a country, not every village, itself." 
               "Yet Paris defended itself against the Allies," said Mrs. Armistead. 
               "Excuse me. Paris is not a village or a city; Paris is a country and a world in itself. Paris is France." 
               "My dear Mrs. Armistead," said Mrs. Goldman, "are you not constantly trembling for your Harry? I have dreadful dreams about Charles. I have not had a quiet night since he left us." 
               "But it is a necessity, and we must bear it," said Mrs. Armistead. "Were I to lose Harry, whom I love so dearly, I would comfort myself with the idea, that he fell in defense of his country and our liberties. I am not only a mother, but also a woman of the South. But God will preserve him to me, I hope." 
               "I never could take comfort were any thing to happen to Charles," sighed Mrs. Goldman. "Country and liberty are but ideas, and they would yield me no consolation." 
               "Country and liberty are realities to me," returned the other lady, in a pointed manner. "If they were not, I should not have sent my most precious to battle in their defense. But Mrs. Goldman," she added, in a softer tone, "nothing has happened to Charles. Why will you insist in borrowing trouble on his account?" 
               "I can not help it! My tenderness for my children will be the death of me." 
               "Have you any news of Colonel Tourtelotte?" 
               "He has not been exchanged as yet. We had a note from him a week ago. It came to Judge Ould, by flag of truce." 
               "How does Antonia feel about it? She does not seem much depressed. Yet she is quieter than formerly." 
               "The dear child bears up with courage. She has stronger nerves than I. In fact it is I who suffer from all the misfortunes of the family. My aunt has a heart of iron." 
               "Madame Outon is strong-minded. Will you remain here when the Yankees come?" 
               "I believe we shall. We never contemplated leaving Pineland in any case. It would be abandoning it to destruction, I believe." 
                
               "Yes. The negroes would take possession. I think we shall go to Richmond. I could not bear to see the enemy on our land. I had rather that the house be burnt, than that Yankees should inhabit it." 
               Mrs. Waddlekins heard the last sentence. She immediately took up the cue, and said: 
               "I would die rather than extend hospitality to the murderers of our husbands, sons, and brothers." 
               Considering that Mrs. Waddlekins did not possess a single relative of either of these denominations, her offer was thought very handsome by all present. 
               "If you remain here," said Mrs. Armistead, "while the Yankees are in possession, you will be cut off from communication with your son. Have you thought of that, Mrs. Goldman?" 
               "No. And if that is the case, I shall not stay. Aunt, what do you think of going to Richmond until affairs are settled in this State? There are good French circles in the capital." 
               "I shall not leave Pineland, except for an excursion," returned Madame la Generale, "and it seems to me that the present is no time for such a measure." 
               "But the Yankees--" 
               "They will not swallow us alive." 
               "But we shall not be able to hear of Charley." 
               "Our hearing of him has never yet done us any good. You will have fewer nervous headaches." 
               "What do you say Antonia? Could we not leave things in Mr. Sharp's care?" 
               "Who runs away when he sees a musket?" said Antonia, laughing. "We should find him fortified in the cellar or dead of fright at our return. I think we had better stay, mother." 
               "You have no affection for your brother. Mrs. Armistead, how long a stay in Richmond do you contemplate?" 
               "That will depend on circumstances," returned that lady. "I shall come back when the Yankees are driven away. It will not be long, I think." 
               "Father is coming," said Antonia. 
               Mr. Goldman entered, evidently in great perturbation. He was followed by Mr. Sharp. 
               "Good morning, Mrs. Armistead. How are you, Mrs. Waddlekins? My respects to you, Madame! Sarah, my love, I have bad news." 
               "Goldman, my life, you frighten me," said the poor lady, turning pale. 
               "Will you do me the favor to take my arm? The ladies will excuse you," and he conducted her to another room. 
               All turned to Sharp. "What is it? Has any thing happened?" was the general question. 
               "A letter from master Charles has come," said Sharp. 
               "Has he fallen on the field of honor?" inquired Mrs. Waddlekins, in a sepulchral voice. 
               "No ma'am, and he is not going to, either," replied Sharp, with great asperity. "He is wounded, and a prisoner. He merely wrote a line, and it came by flag of truce. He was wounded while on a raid, and had to remain in the next house. There he was taken. And I hope they will keep him, until the war is over." 
               "Poor mother," said Antonia, hastening after her parents. 
               But Madame la Generale sat quiet for a while. Then rising and shaking her curls, she said with energy: "I shall go to him." 
               "But Madame," urged Mrs. Armistead, "consider your age! You can not rely for courteous consideration on these barbarians of the North. I would not advise you to act upon first thoughts in this matter." 
               "I always act upon first thoughts, and I rely upon no one but myself. I am going to Charles. To-morrow I start for the North." 
               "Aunt, I will go with you," said Antonia, who returned at this moment. 
               "All the better, child. The rest must stay here at Pineland. As the Yankees are in the State, I shall not have much difficulty in passing the lines." 
               "My dear Mr. Sharp, you will please see to all the arrangements. I shall want several thousand dollars in gold. One must fee high, to procure indulgencies for a prisoner. Write a letter to Moqueur & Lablache, to transmit my dividends to the French Consul at New York, for I will be absent for some time." 
               "Madame," replied Sharp, "all shall be attended to. I have the honor de vous faire mes compliments." 
               Mrs. Goldman grew quieter when she heard of her aunt's resolution. Still she was stricken down sorely. She said something about accompanying Madame la Generale. But every body remonstrated, and Madame declared that she would not take her along on any consideration. 
               Next morning, Madame Outon and Antonia started on their journey. They were accompanied by a trusty old negro servant and a mulatto woman, who had been Antonia's nurse. Mrs. Goldman, with streaming eyes, took leave of her aunt, and all the household was assembled to see the "ole misses," who had never stirred from home except on short visits, depart for the far North to take care of master Charley. There were sly guesses that Miss Antonia went along to see the Colonel, and one yellow girl timidly asked whether they would bring back Ned to Pineland. As the sun rose, our travelers were already far on their way to the Pass. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XL. 
               IT had fared thus with Charles Goldman: On a raid he had been shot in the chest by an indignant farmer, who, with three sons, defended his premises. A large federal force being in pursuit, his men were compelled to leave him. After the departure of the enemy, the farmer sallied forth and took up the wounded. He had them removed to his house, where they received the best of care. There Charles lay until his wound, which penetrated the right lung, was declared to be healing. Then he reported to the federal officer, who had taken his parole when he found him at the farm house. This officer took him to the Provost Marshal of the army, and at his request Charles' parole was renewed, and made out in writing. Then he was sent to New York, where he claimed to have friends, who would vouch for him. In case their bail was deemed satisfactory, the Provost Marshal gave him permission to remain at large until his wound was fully healed. The sale of a ring enabled him to reach New York in comfort. Still the exertion of the journey, and the anxiety which preyed on his mind, caused a dangerous relapse in his condition. He arrived at the metropolis, and had an alarming hemorrhage from the lungs. This was stopped, but had so weakened him that the attending surgeon demanded authoritatively that his friends be sent for. He named Merrins, who came in great alarm, and showed the utmost sympathy. The Provost Marshal accepted him as one of the sureties, but required another. 
               He hesitated, but finally sent for Mr. Reichenau. When the old merchant appeared, matters were set right at once, and Charles was placed at his own disposal. 
               "I should have you removed at once to my house, my dear sir," said Mr. Reichenau, "but for the comments this would give rise to. My sisters' sense of the proprieties would never permit so flagrant an infraction of the code." 
               "Pray, make no excuses," replied Charles, "I shall do very well at the hotel. I am already your debtor for unmerited kindness." 
               "Do not say so. For I shall insist on another matter. You must make me your banker while in the North. Draw on me for any sums you may need." 
               "Thank you," replied Charles, with a blush. "Our confederate notes do not go far here. But I believe my friend Merrins will-" 
               "Should be happy to do so, but am pinched myself," said Merrins. "Krakowwitzer & Co, have made large investments, and the money market is very tight. Better accept A. Reichenau & Co's offer. Very handsome." 
               "You see, my young friend," said Mr. Reichenau, kindly, "there is no one in this city so well qualified to lend you money as myself. I know where your father's estate lies, and the reputation for wealth he enjoys. So I know that my investment is a safe one. You shall pay me interest, usurious interest if you desire. But it would be folly to refuse my offer. I am so much older than you, that I may presume to say so." 
               "Well then, thank you," replied Charles, grasping his hand. "You shall have no reason to complain of my reluctance any further." And thus the matter was settled. 
               Merrins remained with Charles. He had been conveyed at first to the Fifth Avenue Hotel, but now desired to be removed to the C--, one of the quiet aristocratic hotels of which New York possesses several. It forms one side of a quiet old square, whose grand houses look upon a well kept park in the center. This park is the private property of the residents of the square, and they only possess keys to it. The turmoil of the great city does not seem to penetrate that region. The pavement is little trodden. Few carriages roll past, and they move with a muffled sound. Trucks and carts of low degree are unknown. The sunlight sleeps upon the handsome front of the houses, upon their marble vases overrunning with vines, their flower-patches and smooth lawns, as if the busy mart of this continent were distant many miles, instead of being close by. The breeze sports with the trees of the park as if it was a lazy country breeze, and not a wind expected to propel the numerous vessels daily starting from that port. The very air is pure and quiet. 
               Charles was soon settled in a tasty, fresh looking suit of rooms, and Merrins made himself useful in arranging matters according to the young man's directions. The poor fellow lay stretched out upon the sofa, weak and breathless, yet scarcely able to realize his condition. Nervous excitement had endowed him with an appearance of strength that was deceptive. Neglecting the doctor's charge to keep quiet, he endeavored to converse with Merrins. 
               "You did not expect to see me here in this condition," he inquired, "did you?" 
               "How could I?" said Merrins. "Beg your pardon, may I smoke here? The doctor hasn't forbidden it?" 
               "Light your cigar. No interdiction." 
               The other did so, and puffed away. 
               "How could I expect to see you here," he resumed, "and in this condition. But probably they forced you to enter the army." 
               "No. I entered of my own accord. I left New York for the very purpose." 
               "You must have known why. There is money to be made in every profession, if one is but smart. Did you make much?" 
               "My salary. About a hundred and forty dollars a month, in confederate scrip. Enough to furnish me in gloves." 
                
               "You are joking. You never exposed your life for that, though I account it folly to expose one's life at any rate." 
               "You are correct. I exposed it to defend my country's rights." 
               "Pshaw. Don't throw such words at me. These are phrases for Gentiles. What has a Jew to do with country or rights?" 
               "Why not as much as the Gentile?" 
               "Because we have no country, and no acknowledged rights. Yes, they pretend to give us rights here, but 'tis only because they acknowledge the principle in general, and can't make a special exception. Our country is our money, and the power and influence it gives us; these are our only acknowledged rights." 
               "What monstrous doctrine. You don't believe in it yourself. It is quite preposterous." 
               "Don't I? Indeed I do. We are Jews, and have some right to such doctrine. But the Yankees tread pretty closely on our heels. Did you sell cotton?" 
               "What do you mean?" 
               "To traders that run the lines. Oh, don't keep up these pretensions to me. You never put on a soldier's coat for nothing." 
               "I put it on to fight." 
               "Fight? A nice occupation for a Jew." 
               "A proper occupation for any one, whose rights are threatened." 
               "But you have no rights or wrongs in the affair. The only right that has been left to us is to gain wealth, and the only wrong we can fear is to be deprived of it." 
               "Don't let us talk of these questions," said Charles. "We hold different opinions on this point, and we needn't discuss the subject. How have you fared since I saw you last?" 
               "Very well, thank heaven. I am married now." 
               "I congratulate you." 
               "And have a baby." 
               "That's a natural consequence. I wish you joy." 
               "Thank you. You never saw a finer baby in all your life. It's just cut the front teeth. Every body says it looks like me." 
               "Of course it does. Babies always look like some body, and generally like their fathers. Who did you marry?" 
               "Krakowwitzer & Co., Gents' Clothing and Furnishing Goods, Chatham street. It was an excellent affair all around." 
               "So you are happy?" 
               "Perfectly. They took me in partnership at once, accepting my notes as capital. But they knew why." 
               "Of course. You are an energetic business man." 
               "Mr. Goldman, I can take an oath on it that I got our firm three heavy contracts cheaper than any other man in the world could have done. I never bribed the clerks or favorites. I always went to the chief men themselves, or better still, to their wives. Offer a woman a good heavy round sum of money, and she'll make her husband leap over the moon to earn it. And the expense is less, though the risk is greater than bribing small people." 
               "So you bribe officials up North here." 
               "Just as they do down South, and out west, and east. Nobody gives himself trouble for nothing." 
               "Were your profits great?" 
               "We made a fortune, a fortune, sir. Then we freighted a vessel to run the blockade with English goods and arms, and she came into Charleston handsomely. She carried back cotton. The next trip was to Matamoras. After that, we sold her. Now we ought to have stopped. But we speculated in gold and lost heavily." 
               "That is risky business." 
               "It is, it is. We shall have to work for another contract, or run the blockade again to retrieve. After all, I might have done better in marrying Lowenmaul Bros. But I am satisfied with Krakowwitzer & Co. You must come and see our baby. It looks ever so cunning with its foot in its mouth. It's a perfect beauty." 
               At last Merrins left, promising to send a trusty man to wait on Charles, and nurse him. Nor was it long before the expected nurse made his appearance. It was a dry, middle-aged person, of a set quiet demeanor. His name was Moses Useful. Without awaiting any orders, he took hold of Charles, undressed him, and put him to bed. Then he trotted down-stairs with his brisk muffled step, found the steward, procured a cup of nice tea, a couple of pieces of toast, and a soft boiled egg, and brought them to the patient. 
               "I don't want any thing," said Charles, laying back in utter exhaustion, and motioning him away. 
               But Moses useful was accustomed to sick folks. He simply propped the young man's head up, and held the cup to his lips with the word: "Drink." 
               A few swallows were taken, and then Moses presented a slice of toast, with the equally laconic direction: "Eat." 
               Thus the food disappeared, and the patient fell asleep. Next morning he awoke in high fever. The doctor declared that he was much worse. The bodily exertion and excitement of mind of the day before, together with the effects of the hemorrhage, combined to produce the most alarming symptoms. In the afternoon, delirium set in. When Mr. Reichenau called before going home to dinner, he found Charles raving wildly, while Moses Useful was watching at the bedside with an anxious countenance. As soon as he saw the old gentleman, he vociferated: 
               "You have just left her. What is she doing. She is not married to Welland, is she? Why don't you speak? Oh, my beauty, my love, my Emma," he added, softly, "it was all a mistake. You never cared for him, did you?" and then, wildly springing up, he cried: "Charge boys, charge! Give it to them! First the pistol, then the sword. See them run!" And in this manner, all the evening. At night he was quieter. Moses kept ice on his head. In the morning he awoke in a low muttering condition. 
               When Mr. Reichenau called in the afternoon, he found him thus. As he left, he beckoned Moses out and inquired: 
               "What does the doctor say?" 
               "Shakes his head and says nothing." 
               "Did he continue to rave all of yesterday evening." 
               "Yes. He was wild till midnight." 
               "His mind seems to run on a lady, and on fighting." 
               "I don't know. I never listen to what they say." 
               "Don't let any strangers in, while he is in that condition." 
               "Nobody wants to come in," and Moses resumed his place at his bedside. 
               On the next day, the delirium was over. The patient grew conscious and reasonable. A state of great debility, of entire prostration, followed. The poor white face grew almost transparent in its wan blood-lessness, and the gentle blue eyes, inordinately large and languid, seemed to gaze around without much perception. Lips and nostrils were as of wax. The golden hair threw its pale splendors over this countenance, that seemed to belong more to the grave than to a denizen of the nether world. 
               While in this state, a condition of hopelessness and discouragement prevailed that made the doctor look graver every day. The fact was, the patient was sinking. He could hide it no longer from himself, and he communicated it to Mr. Merrins, and Mr. Reichenau. The former shook his head sadly, and went off to see old Mr. Hygood about it. The latter considered for a while, and then stepped into Charles' room, and said to him, in a low voice: 
               "Mr. Goldman, you have never inquired about Emma." 
               The patient started violently, and turned his eyes upon the speaker. 
               "You used to be friends, I think. Emma takes much interest in you. She asks me daily, and I am sorry not to be able to give better reports of your recovery." 
               Charles smiled faintly. "Mr. Reichenau," he said, "will you grant me one more favor. You have been so kind to me." 
               "If it be in my power." 
               "I think it is. I feel that I am dying. I shall not last many days more. Prevail on Emma to see me ere I die." 
               "To come here? Consider for a moment. That is impossible." 
               "She is not married, or engaged to be?', 
               "Neither the one, nor the other." 
               "No one can object then, but the lady or yourself. Will you consent, if she does?" 
                
               "It is impossible. At least give me time. I will tell you to-morrow." 
               "Please do," and the patient closed his eyes, and heaved a weary sigh. 
               Mr. Reichenau threw one more look at the poor emaciated youth with the ice bladder on his wounded chest, and then went his way thoughtfully. Matters had taken a turn he did not anticipate. He must consult with his daughter on this point. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XLI. 
               OLD Mr. Hygood was a character. He was a type of the noblest class of medieval Jews, as they existed at a time when outside oppressions had forced home benevolence into an exuberant growth, and when the harsh bigotry of the Gentile produced among the Israelites an exceeding charity toward any of different opinions. His benevolence was not that of modern times, that organizes societies for systematic and discriminating relief of the poor. It was that old fashioned, spontaneous, truly humane benevolence which put its hand into its pocket when it saw a fellow-creature in need, without asking whether he deserved it, or when he had been relieved last. Every poor man applied to him. If little was needed, he gave it of his own store. If much, he went about and collected it. If there was sickness, none so kind a nurse as he. If there was death, he undertook the arrangements, and had the corpse washed, and shrouded, and buried, without forcing the relatives to enter into the harrowing details. Came a stranger to town, poor and sick, he took him to the hospital. Had he a family, he looked for lodgings, had fuel carted, and flour, and other necessaries, and assisted personally in the arrangement of the furniture. But not only was he charitable to the poor, but also to the rich. Wherever grief entered, in the tenement of the Jew pauper, or in the mansion of the millionaire, old Mr. Hygood was summoned to comfort the sick with his kindly ways, or to administer to the dying the consolations of religion. He was eminently one who recalled the hero of Leigh Hunt's "Abou Ben Adhem," for he "loved his fellow-men." Old Mr. Hygood has been so minutely described, because such, characters belong to the old times, and are passing away from among us. He was not a good man because he was a good Jew, but a good Jew because he was a good man. 
               This venerable gentleman entered Charles' room with Merrins next morning. He greeted the young man with a kindly smile, and said: 
               "Your friend thought that you were going already, but I see it isn't as bad as that. I've seen many recover that were worse than you. Are you comfortable?" 
               "Oh yes, but quite weak," replied Charles, glancing at Merrins with a look of inquiry. 
               "I was afraid something might happen, my friend," said the latter, "and so I brought Mr. Hygood to read to you the customary prayers." 
               "Which wont be necessary," rejoined the old gentleman. "I have seen a great many sick, and I believe you will recover. Is there any thing I can do to cheer you. If you want to write home, I will see that the letter goes South." 
               "Can you? I am much obliged to you." 
               "Send me the letter to-morrow. I know several who go to Metamoras. And now good morning. Your friend will outlive me, Mr. Merrins. I shan't say any death prayers for him, or I am sadly mistaken." 
               So Moses Useful took paper and pencil and indited a note from Charles' dictation, which the young man signed. It was transmitted to Mr. Hygood the same day, and went at once to Pineland by way of Metamoras. 
               On that day, Mr. Reichenau, after, breakfast, turned suddenly to his daughter, and said: 
               "Emma, come into the library." The young lady followed him in great astonishment, leaving aunt Margaret behind, no less astonished. Mr. Reichenau sat down in a large fauteul and gazed at his daughter, who stood before him with one hand leaning on the table, and her head slightly bent. She was dressed in white muslin, trimmed with fanciful figures in black braid. There was a single rosebud on her breast, and a pink ribbon confined her hair. The father delighted in the beauty of the daughter. Yet he could not conceal from himself that that beauty had lost its first brilliancy, and that the marble-like form remained, without the life-spirit that used to animate it. 
               "Emma, I wish to hear the truth from you to-day-" 
               "Father, have you ever heard ought else from me?" 
               "No. But I am about to inquire into a matter that parents generally think themselves entitled to be informed on, but that I have never thought it proper to ask about." 
               "You are as serious as a church, father. Have I offended you?" asked Emma, tenderly. She had grown much softer in manner. 
               "No, child. It is not displeasure that makes me serious. Let me see. Mr. Goldman has paid some attention to you?" 
               "Yes," replied the girl, casting down her eyes. "Before the war." 
               "Has he done any thing further? Tell me all." 
               "He has asked me to be his wife." 
               "And you have rejected him. Is it so?" 
               "It is," replied Emma, with a sigh. 
               "Queer girl! I can't make her out," said Mr. Reichenau to himself, taking a turn through the room. 
                
               "I do not insist upon your answer," he resumed, "but I should like to know for what reason?" 
               "For several," replied Emma, in a low voice. "Chiefly because I thought him effeminate, and wanting in manliness." 
               "What?" cried the father, staring. "Our papers call him one of the boldest cavalry officers of the South, and he has led more successful charges than any other man in their service." 
               "I know it," replied the girl. "Any thing more, father?" 
               "Yes. Has Colonel Welland ever paid you any particular attentions? You are blushing! You need not give any other reply. Poor Goldman!" 
               "You are mistaken, father," cried Emma, vehemently. "Colonel Welland is nothing to me but a friend, a dear friend." 
               "I understand that. Never mind. You need not explain." 
               "But, father, will you not believe my solemn assurance.?" 
               "Certainly; the consequence of your blushing cheeks." 
               "Not the assurance of my lips. Colonel Welland can never be more to me than a friend. Upon my soul, he can not!" 
               "Why?" inquired the old man, "I thought your blushes of before told a different tale. Where is the obstacle? Fortune?" 
               "Do not think so meanly of me, father! Fortune is not the obstacle. As for my blushes, they arise from other emotions than affection." 
               "Not from shame! My daughter has nothing to be ashamed of. What is it about Colonel Welland? I thought he was attentive to you?" 
               "He is engaged to a young lady from the South; to Mr. Goldman's sister. But it is a secret as yet." 
               "Whew!" and the old gentleman took another turn through the room, while Emma maintained her position at the table. Finally Mr. Reichenau resumed his chair, and took another look at the tall, handsome figure before him. 
               "You have something to say to me," remarked Emma. "Let me hear it at once." 
               "Yes. Only give me time to recover from my surprise. He is engaged to Mr. Goldman's sister. Hm, Hm! I am very sorry to hear this very sorry." 
               "What!" cried Emma, with a deep and painful flush upon her Countenance. "Why should you be sorry, father?" 
               "I need not tell you, child. But I am very sorry." 
               "You surprise me. There is no occasion for sorrow or regret." Her features grew hard and proud as she said this, and her eyes flamed in magnificent scorn. "I am well content." 
               "What do you know about it? I say, that this is bad news for me." 
               This was more than Emma could well endure. Her father's expressions of regret, which she thought were elicited by the fact that Welland could not become his son-in-law, seemed to her not only in bad taste, but altogether too strong. So she said coldly: 
               "I know enough to be able to say that you should not regret it on my account. I am content and happy-" 
               "What has that to do with it?" said Mr. Reichenau, looking curiously at his daughter. "One of my heaviest debtors in Tennessee told me that he was as good as engaged to Miss Goldman, and would build up his estate: with her money. If she marries Colonel Welland, I wouldn't give much for the debt on Mr. Tourtelotte's estate." 
               "Oh!" and Emma was about to retire in great confusion, when her father detained her by taking her hand. 
               "Emma," he said. "I have told you of Charles Goldman, and his condition. The doctor says that he will probably die. He has asked me to let him see you once more." 
               "And you have consented?" she asked, eagerly. 
               "I said: it was impossible. It would give rise to comments." 
               "Had you the heart to do it, and he dying?" 
               "It was hard, I know. However, he persisted, and referred the matter to you. He asked that you might decide." 
               "Is he so low?" 
                
               "He is in that condition when a hair may turn the scales. He has been running down; but then his will is relaxed, he makes no effort, he does not try to get well. Considering all this, and the fact that if his nervous power was roused, it might save his life, I have consented that you should see him, if you yourself decide for it." 
               "Thank you, father, thank you!" 
               "You will see him, then? Have you considered?" 
               "I have considered that I may save the life of a brave man." 
               "And imperil the reputation of a pretty girl" 
               "I don't care for the scandal-mongers. Do you? Aunt Mag goes with me, of course." 
               "Of course. But there is another point. Is it right to awaken hopes, which afterward you may be compelled to disappoint?" 
               "Don't inquire, father. Let matters take their course. I will order the carriage for eleven. Good morning." 
               And with a radiant face, she kissed him, and ran up-stairs. He was puzzled and pleased. In truth, he had learned much of Charles Goldman in the last few days, and not only respected, but liked him. The latter feeling was augmented by his peculiar position, with no friend near him but Mr. Reichenau, who, in a measure, considered himself now the sole protector of the young man. He knew enough of the circumstances of the Goldman family, to feel easy on the score of fortune, and so he determined to let things take their course, and even help them along if necessary. His constantly increasing desire to have a son-in-law who would be a reliable help to him in business, and whose presence would at once brighten the now quiet mansion on Fifth Avenue, had much to do with his decision. 
               At eleven o'clock, aunt Margaret, who, after a stormy address by her niece, had surrendered the point of etiquette and promised to accompany her, appeared in the parlor, ready to go out. Emma joined her there, and both ladies entered the carriage, and were driven to the C-- Hotel. They sent their cards up, and waited, aunt Margaret in nervous agitation, and Emma in a state of excitement that she could not master. Her face turned all manner of colors. Her eyes were brilliantly joyful at one moment, and cast down the next. In vain she tried to prescribe some rule for her conduct toward Charles. It was impossible to control her thoughts. 
               The maid returned, and conducted them to Charles' room. Aunt Margaret entered first, and passing through the sitting-room stepped up to the bed, and said: "My poor dear friend!" 
               Emma followed her, and in a moment they, were face to face. 
               There he lay with his white transparent face; his large burning eyes were fixed upon her, as if his life hung upon that gaze. The man she had rejected. Whom she had thought an effeminate dandy. And the ugly wound, but lightly concealed by the handkerchief thrown over it, seemed to cry out and ask, as he had once done: "Have you no heart?" 
               "I am deeply grateful for your kindness," said Charles at last, in that low thrilling voice which penetrates the heart. "I shall the less fegret to die a stranger in a strange land." 
               "To die!" said aunt Margaret. "Let us hope that it is not so bad. You are young. You must make an effort." 
               "Why?" said Charles. "I have nothing to live for except my country, and she will find abler defenders." 
               "You are speaking sinful words," returned the old lady. "You have much to live for. What a fine view of the park," she continued, stepping to the window, and looking out. 
               The young people were left alone, or as good as alone. Emma had been unable to articulate a syllable. She was deeply touched by the looks of Charles, whom she recollected, bright, brilliant, and overflowing with health and vitality. As he gazed at her with those large spectral eyes in whose depths the burning love of the man found expression, her tender pity gave way to emotions more tumultuous. She felt that joyous throb, which seems the essence sence of all the glories of life, and which only the presence of a lover can awaken in a maiden's bosom, or the sight of the beloved in that of man. Impulsive as ever, she seized his hand, and cried: "Charles, forgive me!" 
               "Forgive you! Emma-," and his eyes grew troubled. "You have done me no wrong. And had you, this kindness would atone for it all. Pardon me," and he pressed her hand to his white lips. 
               "Charles, I have thought often of you. When you saw me last I was a rash, inconsiderate girl, that did not know her own heart. I have changed since then. I am a woman now, and oh Charles, I feel that I have not acted right toward you." 
               "Emma, for God's sake, do not tell me now, when life is ebbing away, that there was happiness in store for me yet! Emma, say it is not so!" 
               She bowed her head, and wept bitterly. 
               "Yet, tell me! Let me die happy! Had I lived, could you have loved me, Emma? dear girl, tell me; speak!" 
               Instead of any reply whatever, she wound her arms around his neck and kissed him passionately, while the tears from her eyes trickled over his face. His arms closed around her, and for a moment there was an unbroken silence in the room. From without, the rustle of the trees in the summer wind, and the low thrilling call of the female birds could be heard. Aunt Margaret turned and saw that passionate embrace, saw the commingling of the sunny hair with the black. She approached softly. At that moment, Charles' arms relaxed and dropped at his side. Emma raised her face, and gave one look, then leaped up wildly, and cried: 
               "He is dead, he is dead!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XLII. 
               HE was not dead, he had only fainted. Moses Useful appeared on the scene with restoratives, and in a short time Charles opened his eyes, and faintly attempted to seize the hand of the sobbing girl at his bedside. But now aunt Margaret interfered, and said: 
               "We are doing you harm, Mr. Goldman. Good bye. If you behave well, we will return soon." Without much further ado she led Emma off, and drawing that young lady's veil over her face, managed to get her into the carriage, without other manifestations of hysterics than a violent trembling. The coachman was ordered to drive home. 
               "A fine morning's work, child, I am afraid the poor fellow wont get over it. It was highly imprudent in me to let you talk to him," she said. 
               "Not at all, aunt," replied Emma, "I feel sure now that he will recover. But oh, I can't tell you how I felt when I thought him dead." 
                
               "Your partiality has arisen quite suddenly, child." 
               "As these things do. I feel like a changed being. At first I experienced great pity for him. Then I yearned to comfort him. When I thought he was dying, I put appearances aside. And when he kissed me the spell was complete. It filled me with love." 
               "Emma, I will not hear such unmaidenly sentiments. I request that you remember the respect due to me, if you are determined to forget yourself. You are in a state of exaltation." 
               "I am, aunt, and I care not to hide it. Dear aunty, I must talk to some one. Don't forbid me, please." 
               "But Emma, how often have I urged that you practice the necessary self-control? It is the garment with which we cover the nakedness of our sentiments, not only to hide them from the world's gaze, but also protect them from its attacks." 
               "But I don't care for the world just now. I am happy." 
               "You were always romantic, and your father did all he could to encourage your fantastic notions. I wash my hands of this affair." 
               "The DeWolfs are stopping at our door. Shall I have the carriage turn?" 
               "No, they have seen us." The vehicle proceeded, and Mrs. and Miss DeWolf were encountered, and taken in. 
               Aunt Margaret was rather pleased to meet them at this moment. Several of their circle were guests at the C-- Hotel, and she was aware that their visit to Charles had been noticed. So like a good matadore, she determined to take the bull by the horns. The party were scarce seated in the parlor, when, with great liveliness, she said to the elder lady: 
               "Where do you think we have been, ma'am? Guess." 
               "How can I?" replied the other. "Perhaps with Miss Canfield, the bride. Have you seen the diamond set Mr. Gray gave her?" 
               "No, we have not been there. Have we, Emma?" 
               Emma was confused. She did not appreciate the tactics of her aunt. So she murmured an indistinct negative. 
               "I am sure I can not guess. Can you Amanda? Do tell us." 
               "Well, my dear friend, we have been to see a gentleman." 
               "What? visited a gentleman?" cried Mrs. DeWolf. "His wife, you mean." 
               "No. For he has no wife. Actually, has no wife." 
               "A single gentleman!" exclaimed Amanda. "Then it was at an early picnic or breakfast party, and some lady maternized it. Who could it have been. I haven't heard of the affair." 
               "Neither picnic, nor breakfast," replied aunt Mag. "A simple morning visit to an unmarried gentleman at his own rooms. Isn't it horrid! And of all things in the world, we found him in bed." 
               Mrs. DeWolf grew very serious. But Amanda said laughingly: 
               "Now I understand; some old bachelor relative at the point of death, who is going to leave you unnumbered thousands." 
               "No indeed. Aunt is teasing you," said Emma. "We went to see Mr. Charles Goldman at the C-- Hotel, where he is wounded and a prisoner." 
               "What!" cried bath ladies. And Mrs. DeWolf added frigidly: "You must take a great interest in the young gentleman." 
               "We do," replied Emma. "Aunt Margaret has always felt maternally disposed toward him, and when she insisted on going, I offered to accompany her, to save the proprieties. Wasn't that right?" 
               "People have different opinions regarding these things, and it is best not to discuss such differences," replied Mrs. DeWolf with reserve. "But we are really making quite a stay, when I only called to bid you good morning. Now come to see me soon. I suppose you will have some news to communicate when you see me next." And the ladies took their departure. 
               "That is the way the world will judge of it, Emma," said aunt Margaret, looking after the DeWolf carriage. 
               "I do not care. If that girl had known Charles was in town, she would have come to see him, mother or no mother," replied the young lady, haughtily. 
                
               And thus it was. Miss DeWolf was full of bitter regrets. Wounded and a prisoner, helpless and deserted in New York. What a chance for a lady merciful to step in and win his heart. How romantic, to take care of him all in secret, nurse him, perhaps save his life, and when people got to talk about it, appear as the bride of the wealthy and handsome Southerner, whose bravery was the general theme! But now Emma had done all that, and she must be punished for it, Breathing revenge, the two ladies continued their calls, and at each house, told a longer and more miraculous story of Emma's indiscretion, and the perfect impropriety of sanctioning such a thing, as her aunt seemed to do. 
               In the mean while, Charles lay on his couch, recovering from the effects of the shock, which too much joy had occasioned. He was very weak, and he seemed to himself light as a feather. The rustle of the trees fell on his ear with a dreamy sound, and the varying lights and shades as they swept to and fro, with each breath of the wind, seemed to carry him with them like the waves of a sea. When he closed his eyes, delightful visions dawned on him. He seemed floating in the blue empyrean, with the clouds below him spreading their masses of scarlet, purple and gold, and the stars revolving on either hand in luminous circles. Far below, hung the burning sun and the pale moon; still lower, was the earth, with the vast sea and lofty mountains tains. He could hear the music of the spheres, and the, voice of the planets, as they praised the Lord. And he gently floated away, rocked as if on summer waves, and drifted, drifted into the Infinite, where sight and hearing ceased, and the only consciousness of existence was intense joy that filled the soul, and overflowed. 
               Moses Useful could not enter into these spiritual delights. He roused Charles from his dreams of glory to a reality that consisted of tea and a soft-boiled egg. Nor did the young man neglect to do justice to them. And then he relapsed into visions. Embarked on a boat of silver, he floated down a broad river. Balmy breezes fanned his silken sails. On either side, lofty palms waved their broad-leaved crests, and wondrous flowers nodded over the rushing water. But from the bosom of the river arose the Lotos, that mysterious lily, whose form is the essence of grace, and whose perfume intoxicates the mariner. They rose higher and higher with their crystal petals, and seemed to crowd around him, and breathe upon him with warm passionate breaths, until they took away his own, and the excess of pleasure became pain. 
               Again Moses Useful appeared with a bit of steak, and some brandy and water. Charles partook once more, and relapsed again. A desert spread around him. The immense space was yellow sand, bright and merciless, burning in the rays of the sun. The sky was glowing as if of red-hot copper. The earth was dry as if of molten brass. No cloud, no vegetation. The eye lost itself in the contemplation of the sky and the sand. Then he seemed to fly on broad wings over this desert, striving to reach the end, yet never seeing it. On and on, and yet far as the eye could see, burning desert. 
               Moses Useful interfered with some cooling lemonade. 
               In the afternoon, Charles slept, and toward evening Mr. Reichenau called as usual. 
               "You have saved my life," said Charles, taking his hand. "Will you consent to make it happy?" 
               "Have matters gone so far?" asked the merchant. 
               Charles blushed. "Emma has been here," he said, "and I have reason to believe that she is not indifferent to me." 
               "Get well, first of all," said Mr. Reichenau, "and then we will discuss this affair further." 
               So the young man had no reason to anticipate serious objections on the father's side. He took the proffered advice, and got well rapidly. Moses Useful fed him to an enormous extent. And the quiet location of the hotel favored a great deal of sleep. But if a man does not get well between hearty eating and sound sleep, with a doctor who gives him no medicines, and friends that do not bother him with visits, when, in the name of heaven, is he to get well? 
               Oh, those happy days of convalescence! Every now and then sweet fruit or delicacies arrived from the Reichenau ladies. Then Merrins stepped in and amused the patient with his budget of news, and his own selfish comments. In the latter part of the afternoon fell Mr. Reichenau's visit, who would say laughingly, that he came to assure himself of Charles safety, as he had gone bail for him. 
               The wound closed up. A harrassing cough, that had troubled the patient at times, also disappeared. He gained in strength, and in spirits. But a couple of weeks had passed since Emma's visit, and he already ventured down-stairs, leaning upon the arm of Moses Useful, and endeavored to eat a dinner at the table of the hotel. One sunny afternoon the Reichenau carriage waited in front of the hotel. Many stopped to take a look at it, and others waited to see who it was sent for. Charles came down, his sea-blue eyes bright with the fire of returning health, a flush pale as a rose leaf on his thin cheek, and his long golden hair waving around a face that had been spiritualized by the refining influences of sickness. He wore the gray uniform, with golden chevrons wandering up the sleeves, and a narrow binding of scarlet relieving the color. Moses Useful supported him on one side, while a cane gave he requisite steadiness to the other. Thus, he reached the carriage, and was seated on the soft cushions, especially arranged for him. It was quite a drive they took him, far out into the blooming country, where all nature seemed to throb with the life of spring in its full glory. He had never before taken such exquisite delight in the simple productions of the fields as now. For he returned from the portals of death, and felt as if he must welcome each flower and rejoice with it, over the new lease of life granted him. 
               The meadows were very green. Like golden stars the dandelions waved on light tubular stems. They did not stand singly, but in masses. Light flocks of buttercups hovered on the banks. The trees shook themselves airily. The clouds seemed playing at bo-peep. The world was so pleasant, that it seemed to Charles as if he never could contentedly depart from it, and it was impossible to understand his feelings of a few weeks ago. 
               The carriage stopped at Mr. Reichenau's mansion, Charles was helped out, and into the house. He had been asked to dinner. The ladies awaited him in the parlor. It was with deep blushes that the young people met. But Emma regained her self-possession almost immediately, and assumed the duties and authority of a nurse. The confederate officer was placed upon a sofa, and bolstered up with all sorts of wonderful little cushions, which aunt Margaret had provided. They were the cushions of a past age; small and hard, with parrots, lions, tigers or dogs upon them in gorgeous embroidery. Thus enthroned, the ladies declared that he could not wait till dinner time, but must partake of wine and a biscuit, to stay him till then. The happy dog! He suffered himself to be fed by the fairest hands in the world, and affected a great deal more exhaustion than he felt, in order to protract the performance. How different was Emma! The quiet, matured woman, animated by a tender and loving heart, had taken the place of the proud and frivolous girl. The rosebud, with sharp thorns, had opened into a rose, whose beauty overshadowed the prickly defenses! 
               Mr. Reichenau came home, and they had dinner. The old gentleman was full of kindness, but declared at once, that if the ladies made such a pet of Charles, he would believe himself insulted, and leave. He also interdicted much further talk on the young man's part. 
               "You must be kept quiet," he said. "The fault shall not rest with me if you have a relapse." 
               Whereupon Charles declared himself ready to suffer any number of relapses, provided they were attended with such a visit as that of Emma. And Emma blushingly bade him not tell tales out of school, or she would regret her part in the affair. 
               When the ladies had left the gentlemen with their wine, Charles Goldman said: 
               "There is one question that has been on my tongue for weeks. Permit me to put it now. Will you give me Emma's hand? Will you give her to me, sir?" 
               "If I did not intend so, I should not have permitted her first visit to you. Yes, take her." 
               "But-but-I am afraid you do not know all about me." 
               "Indeed? What is it? Have you committed murder or robbery?" 
               "No sir, but I am-I am a Jew." 
               Mr. Reichenau laughed. "And I have no religion whatever, except the belief in God and humanity." 
               "It will not be an obstacle then-?" 
               "Not at all, if you are an honorable man. And Emma, if she likes, may join you. She has not been raised in any of the beliefs of our prevalent sects. The only faith I should object to in a son-in-law is the Mohammedan, and to that on account of the wives." 
               "You are truly liberal in religious matters, I am happy to find," said Charles, with devout gratitude. 
               "As most of the educated Germans. The prejudices which they still nourish, are not religious but social, and such, as a matter of course, are out of place in this country." 
               They returned to the parlor, where Mr. Reichenau said at once: "The only condition I shall insist on is this: You must live in New York one half of the year." The young pair thus saw themselves officially acknowledged as lovers. 
               When Charles returned to the hotel, he found Madame la Generale and Antonia, who, after many difficulties, had at last found him. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XLIII. 
               THERE was great joy on both sides. After divers embraces, in which Madame la Generale gave Antonia little chance at Charles, the old lady composed herself to listen to the history of his sickness, as well as to relate the incidents of her own pilgrimage in search of him. But a hostile power intervened to prevent this consummation. Moses Useful stepped forward, and opined that it was time for the ladies to retire to their apartments; they had taken some on the same floor. Madame glared at him in proud surprise, and Charles ordered him to hold his tongue, and mind his business. But Moses said, he was minding his business. The ladies might do as they pleased, "but you must go to bed immediately, and go to sleep." 
               "I'll turn you out of doors, sir, if you don't leave me alone." 
               But Moses went, and took the young gentleman's coat off, notwithstanding his resistance. Charles grew furious. 
               "I discharge you, sir. You need not attend on me any longer." 
               Moses shook his head good-humoredly at the ladies, and said: "I never listen to what they say. I only do what the doctor tells me," and he deprived Charles of vest and boots. Antonia saw that the matter was growing serious, and said to Madame la Generale: 
                
               "Come, aunt. Charles has had enough excitement to-day. I suppose the nurse is correct in ordering us off. We can talk at breakfast tomorrow. Come now." 
               It was with a little difficulty however that Madame could be prevailed on to leave Charles. "Not for the matter itself," she said, "but because it seemed as if they did so, in obedience to the orders of that impertinent servant." 
               She stood over the young man with tears in her eyes, and murmured: "My brave boy, I bless you! You are the true descendant of mon pere le brave General. Je vous salue, mon cher." 
               Charles growled at Moses, when the ladies had departed, but to no purpose. The faithful fellow put him to bed, lowered the lights, and saw him soundly asleep before he himself turned in. 
               But Madame, when she reached her own rooms, at once summoned her corps of servants, consisting of the old negro and the mulatto woman. 
               "I have seen just now," she began, shaking her beer-barrel curls, and raising her fore finger, "a dreadful example of disobedience, obstinacy, and rebellion in a Northern servant against his master. I have called you Juba, and you Mammy Mary to warn you against keeping company with these people. You are both faithful servants." 
               "Yes, Missis, we am," said Juba. "Aint we, Mammy?" 
                
               "I'se like to see the woman that says I'se not a good servant," she replied. 
               "Well, if you learn the ways of these Northern servants, you will be bad servants, and the Lord will punish you for it. I have taken you with me because I trusted in you. You have always been taken good care of at Pineland. Have you not?" 
               "Yes, Missis," replied both. "I wish we was there now," added Juba. 
               "But these Northern servants have nobody to take care of them. When they grow old and can't work, they must starve. You understand that, don't you, Juba?" 
               "Yes, Missis. I understands all you say." 
               "Very well. Because people here will talk to you, and tell you that you are free. It is not so. We have bought you, and paid for you, and if you run away, you steal our property." 
               "I wouldn't run away for a thousand dollars," protested Juba, while Mammy said: "She was an honest nigger, and hadn't done no wrong." 
               "Because, if you want to run away here, I can't prevent you." 
               "You'd send the police and the hounds after us," said Juba, smiling. 
               "No, I could not, in this unnatural country," persisted Madame. 
               "Couldn't you put us in the calaboose and have us whipped?" asked Juba again, with great curiosity. 
                
               "No, Juba. But God would punish you for it." 
               "Well, Misses, I wouldn't run away for a hundred dollars." 
               "I trust you wouldn't. What would people at home think of it? You may go to bed. Mammy, undress me." 
               Next morning, the party assembled for a late breakfast in Madame's bed-room. 
               "Charles, I ask you to make quite a sacrifice to my habits," said Madame, "but I always breakfast in bed now." 
               In truth, Madame had had her hair dressed elaborately, and was adorned with a cap of a very coquettish pattern. 
               "And now, dear aunt," said the young man, after he had demolished a chop and quarter of a dozen of eggs, "tell me of all the adventures you went through, for the sake of your scapegrace of a nephew. How did you pass the lines?" 
               "We had a great deal of difficulty. They took us first for Northern people trying to get away from the South, and abducting Juba and Mammy." 
               "It was not difficult to rectify that mistake, I hope?" 
               "You are in error. It was most difficult. For they would not believe us. In almost every town I had a scuffle with the Provost Marshals. The wretches! I told them my opinion without reserve or prevarication." 
               "What did you do then?" 
               "I judged it best to go to the nearest headquarters. There I explained every thing to the General Commanding-a gentleman of the first water-a preux chevalier-" and the old lady kissed her hand with a great affectation of youthfulness. 
               "Truly he was very attentive to us," said Antonia, laughing. 
               "But you did not show much appreciation of his politeness," replied Madame, shaking her curls. "You almost repulsed his kindness." 
               "May I light a cigar?" asked Charles. 
               "If you will sit by the open window," replied Madame. "This General furnished us passes, and we came without further difficulty to the enemy's lines. Who do you think we met there? A friend of ours; a Colonel in command of a brigade; serving in Gen. Burnside's corps. Who do you think?" 
               "I have not the remotest idea, aunt," said Charles, puffing away. 
               "Mr. Welland. I was never more glad in my life. I spent such a pleasant day with him!" 
               "What!" cried Charles. "I am glad to hear it." 
               "Well, he took me all around their camp, and introduced me to the Generals, and procured me passes-it is a thousand pities that Antonia was unable to join us." 
               "What was the matter," asked Charles. 
               "She had a violent headache, and kept her bed all day. The place where we were lodging, was a damp house, and she must have caught cold. Mr. Welland was very sorry. He talked of her twice or thrice. What a time for a young lady to be sick, when a gentleman like Mr. -- I should say Colonel Welland is desirous of paying his respects to her." 
               "I could not help it, aunt," said Antonia, blushing. "Could I?" 
               "Of course not. Still it was quite annoying, because you are generally well.-After that I had no difficulties, except in finding you. I spent a great deal of time in Washington, and went from one office to another, and was on swords' points with one half of those boors of officials, who instead of telling me where to find you, made me wait-wait in their anti-chambres, and gave me ambiguous answers." 
               "How did you find out at last?" 
               "By calling upon the ambassador of my country. The ambassador of France did not make me wait, or return an ambiguous answer. He received me like a man who has moved in the haute monde of Paris, and promised information as soon as possible. Two days after, he did me the honor to call upon me, and communicated that you were in the city of New York, at the same time presenting me with a letter of introduction to the Consul in that city." 
               "That was kind," said Charles. 
               "It was the behavior of a gentleman of blood and breeding to an old lady in need of assistance," cried Madame, with enthusiasm. 
                
               "And you went to New York at once?" 
               "We did, after declining the invitation of Monsieur l'Ambassadeur to call on Madame son epouse. And here, we found you at once, by applying to the Provost Marshal." 
               "And now you have found me, what are you going to do with me?" 
               "First of all, hear the story of your adventures," said Antonia. 
               "Now? Right away? What a bore!" 
               "We are all ready. Begin, Monsieur mon frere." 
               "I am so tired. Isn't it enough to have lived through things, must one tell of them in the bargain?" yawned Charles. "Oh, ye women!" 
               "That's grand! A busing us after we have hunted for him half the world over! But it shall not avail you, sir. begin!" 
               "I see that I am to be sacrificed. Where shall I begin?" 
               "From the very first," said Antonia. "Don't be so lazy, buddy." 
               "Buddy" had been Antonia's first endeavor to say "brother," when Charles was a boy of five, and she a toddling baby. It stuck to him for long years, and even now the appellation was used in moments of tenderness. He puffed at his cigar, and began: 
               "It was on a raid, the purpose of which was to surprise and destroy a U. S. depot. We had finished our work, and were returning. My men wanting a number of things, we stopped at several farm-houses to procure them. Of course, we didn't pay in federal scrip. Consequently the farmers offered an occasional resistance. In one of these squabbles I received my wound and had to be left. When it was almost well, I reported to a federal officer who had taken my parole, and was sent here, until I should have recovered completely." 
               "And then?" asked Madame. 
               "Then I will have the opportunity of inspecting the inside of a federal prison. To continue: in the meanwhile my journey, and a number of other things, had made me sick. My wound re-opened and bled profusely. I fell into a fever and began to sink. I believe I was dying. In fact, I had made up my mind that I was." 
               "Horrible. Was this long ago?" cried Madame. 
               "About two weeks. Now I had one friend in this city." 
               "Only one? when you lived here so long," asked Antonia. 
               "One was sufficient. His name is Mr. Reichenau." 
               "What?" said the young lady, "the gentleman-" 
               "Exactly. The father of Miss Emma Reichenau. He saw that I was listless, despondent, without nervous energy, in short, he saw that I would die unless a powerful incentive to live were furnished me. So he sent his daughter to see me." 
                
               "Sent his daughter to see you-a young man, unmarried," cried Madame la Generale; "did he send her alone?" 
               "No. Her aunt came with her." 
               "What manners! What a country!" cried Madame. "Antonia, my child, I am sorry that you have heard of this indelicacy." 
               "Madame, my aunt," cried Charles, blushing, "recollect that you are speaking of my future wife." 
               "Is the boy mad?" cried Madame, raising herself in bed. 
               "Your future wife?" 
               "My future wife," replied Charles, firmly "When she visited me, her visit saved my life, for it gave me something to live for. I grew better from that moment, and last night our engagement received her father's sanction." 
               "I am completely dumb-founded. Charles, can this be so? Of course Miss-What's-her-name is of your religion," said the old lady, disarranging her cap and curls in her agitation. 
               "She is not yet," said Charles, hesitatingly," but will become so before long." 
               "Will become so before long? Grand Dieu, what do you say to this, Antonia?" 
               They turned to her. Antonia had fainted. In a moment all was confusion and noise. Charles tugged at the bell handles, and called out into the hall. Madame, in a long ghostly night gown, leaped from the bed and dashed cold milk, which she took for water, into her niece's face. The chambermaids streamed in. One opened the windows. Another undressed the young lady. A third crowded Charles out. Mammy, being informed, came howling from the servant's hall, and smothered her darling with kisses. Finally, amid all this hubbub, Antonia opened her eyes, and declared that the heat of the room had overcome her. She was carefully removed to her bed by the chambermaids, two of which retired on the instant to their own room and had a private fit of hysterics. Mammy remained with Antonia, smoothing her hair, and talking to her in those murmuring words of endearments that children, and persons in mental distress appreciate so well. 
               When Charles stated that Emma Reichenau was his betrothed, Antonia became suddenly aware that, misled by her brother's representations, she had done Welland grievious wrong. She had not only broken off their intercourse, but absolutely refused to see him when chance had thrown them together. This recollection, and the bitter thought that she had lost him overpowered her. She grew dizzy, and became unconscious. 
               Now she lay as in a trance, with only this feeling uppermost, that she must conceal from everybody the wounds of her heart. This idea nursed her to action. No one should perceive in her demeanor that it had been any thing but an ordinary fainting fit. She would bear her burden, as such burdens must be borne, alone. 
               Charles, in the meanwhile, penned a note to Emma, acquainting her with the arrival of his sister and aunt, who, he remarked, were too fatigued to see anybody to-day, but would be happy to see the ladies and Mr. Reichenau on the morrow. What other expressions, suitable to letters passing between people that expect to be married, this epistle contained, it is not necessary to mention here. But it was a four page affair, and closely written at that. And the writer was of the firm opinion, that every sentence contained matter of vital importance. The recipient seemed to be of the like opinion, for she read the letter over twice, and then put it away as carefully as if it were the title deed of some vast estate. The drawer was locked, and every precaution taken against robbery. As if housebreakers made it their especial business to carry off a young lady's loveletters, in preference to the other valuables in the drawers, such as golden drops and silver spoons, bracelets and ear-rings, diamonds and pearls. 
               That day Charles, to the surprise of the other guests, entered the dining-room with two ladies. Madame la Generale, in heavy gray silk with real laces of immense value, and rich jewels in their old fashioned setting, had mounted a wonderful cap, which set off her aristocratic face to great advantage. But Antonia attracted all eyes. In blue tarletan with white flowers in her hair and bosom, she was surpassingly lovely. Her golden curls, tied simply at the back of the head with a blue ribbon, floated down upon her shoulders in rich profusion. Her face was pale, but the sea-blue eyes bright with nervous excitement, shone wondrously. Her neck and arms were clasped by ornaments of small Venetian shells, white and pearly, and altogether, her appearance was a little strange, peculiar, reminding one of a water nymph or mermaid. Charles felt quite proud, when he noticed the universal stir occasioned by the aristocratic bearing of Madame la Generale, and still more by the beauty of Antonia. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XLIV. 
               NEXT morning at eleven, aunt Mag and Emma made their appearance. Madame la Generale had in the meanwhile reflected, and concluded to accept with grace what she could not prevent. The only condition of acceptance reserved in her own mind, was that Emma should have a fine figure and good manners. "The two things most requisite in a lady that moves in society," said Madame to herself. 
               The way in which the old lady received her visitors was admirable. Dressed in very quiet taste, she exhibited an elegance of manner and routine of social forms that placed the callers at once at their ease while it did not involve the loss of a particle of her own dignity. Antonia had been raised under her tuition and manifested the same qualities, with this difference: an air of sweet sincerity and youthful buoyancy pervaded all she said or did. On the other side, aunt Margaret's straight common sense and exceeding kindness of heart, supported by a proper amount of self-dependence supplied the place of high breeding, and contrasted with Madame's manner, not unfavorably. Emma surprised both the Tennessee ladies by the dignity and brilliancy of her beauty. Her manners were rather outre, but like her loud-colored garments seemed to become the style of her face, and were in keeping with her whole appearance. Altogether, as Madame said afterward: "She resembled more a half-civilized Russian princess than a parvenu, and if she was odd, she was not the less distingue." 
               Madame talked a great deal, and found an attractive listener in aunt Mag, who on this account was taken into favor at once. She resuscitated Napoleon and all his marshals, and told of evening parties to the waters of St. Cloud, and of reviews in the Champ de Mars, until the good old lady's mind was completely dazzled. Antonia and Emma retired to a window, and went at once into confidences: Emma with a rush, Antonia with reluctance. But they were not suffered to remain alone. Charles insisted upon being admitted to the circle. So they put cushions into a rocking chair, and made him sit down and promise to keep quiet. 
               "I will," said he, "if you'll let me smoke. Only one cigar." 
               But they would not permit it. 
               "Very well," he said, "I must be content, since you saved my life for the second time just now." 
               "You were not in any danger, as far as I know," replied Emma. 
               "Hidden danger, which you don't know of yet. Danger of being talked to death by my aunt. She has mounted the Napoleon horse." 
               "For shame," said Antonia. "Aunt is very interesting when she talks to strangers. I have always heard them confess as much." 
               "I, for my part, find it so," said Emma. "How grand she is in manners!" 
               "By the time you have heard her anecdotes for the fiftieth time, you wont find it so," replied Charles. "And now I will give you a caution: Never speak in her presence of Napoleon or his times. Discourage every approach to the subject, unless you wish a conversation kept up, without taking the trouble yourself." 
               Lunch was served, and later in the afternoon the Reichenau carriage came. "Who is to go?" was the general question, for they had resolved on a ride in Central Park. 
                
               "Charles, as a matter of course," said Emma, "and as he takes up two seats, I would beg Madame to do us the honor to make use of the remaining seat with aunt Margaret; this invalid needs better care than we young ladies should be able to give him." 
               "I shall be but too happy," replied Madame, with a courtesy, "to have an opportunity to see the splendors of this city, after having had occasion to admire the beauty of its belles." 
               "I accept the compliment," replied Emma, smiling, "as it comes from one who has been a renowned belle herself in the fairest circles of the beau monde." 
               "Oh, you flatterer," whispered Charles. "The bell is worn out, but the clapper remains in excellent condition." 
               This arrangement was evidently the best, though sub rosa the young man demurred against it. He thought it was a shame to send him out with an escort of old women. And, furthermore, he declared loudly, that Emma and Antonia staid at home to plot against his peace and future welfare. That Antonia intended to inform Emma in what manner he might be managed, and the whole was a conspiracy unworthy of human nature. 
               At last the carriage started, and the two girls were alone. Of course they retired at once to a cozy nook, and Emma, placing her arm around Antonia's neck, said: 
               "What a pretty little sister I shall have! Do you know, dear, that my mother died when I was a baby, and I never had either brother or sister? That is what makes me so forward and self-reliant. You must tell me whenever I am too much so, for I will be tutored by you without taking offence, and I want to make Charles love me always as he does now." 
               "He suspected that we would plot against his supremacy," said Antonia. "Emma, he is the very best boy in the world." 
               "To me, of course. But for you there is a better, not so?" 
               Antonia blushed a little, and said with embarrassment: "I know of none." 
               "Oh, you little hypocrite! To be so reserved to your sister that is to be." 
               "But, Emma, I can not confess where there is nothing to confess." 
               "Nothing to confess? I see that you do not honor me with your confidence." 
               "I certainly do. In accepting you as my brother's betrothed, I give you all the claims, which a sister could make upon me." 
               "The first claim that a sister would make is affection." 
               "And have I not given you mine?" asked Antonia, embracing her. 
               "Yes, my sweet little one," replied Emma, drawing the other's head down upon her bosom, and playing with her curls. "Yes. But the next claim is that of confidence. How is it in that regard?" 
                
               "I am willing to confide in you; but there are things one does not confide, even to a sister." 
               "Ah! now we have it," said Emma, triumphantly. "And some of those things are loves and engagements. But if the sister has heard of them before? What then, little reserve? Tell me!" 
               "I do not know what you refer to," replied Antonia. 
               "You are carrying the matter too far. Are you not engaged to be married?" 
               "I am not, Emma. Charles has probably told you that I was. But no engagement exists between Col. Tourtelotte and myself." 
               "Col. Tourtelotte? Who is that?" 
               "The Colonel of Charles' regiment. A neighbor of ours." 
               "And he has pretensions to your hand? Do you love him?" 
               "No. But he is a brave gallant gentleman, and if he does his duty to his country, I have said, that he might hope for my hand. I thought Charles had told you." 
               "Not a word. This is very queer. Antonia, I assure you this is the first I heard of Col. Tourtelotte. May I speak to you without reserve? Quite open?" asked Emma. 
               "Please do so," replied Antonia, uneasily. She would gladly have escaped if she could have done so. 
               "Well then, I thought you were engaged to Col. Welland. In one word, he made a confidant of me and told me so. Did he speak the truth, or did he deceive me?" Emma's cheeks flushed painfully as she pushed this inquiry. She was aware that other feelings beside sympathy for Antonia were involved, in the answer. Not love, but the discovery that her idol was brass; the finding out that her hero worship had deified the unworthy. 
               But Antonia raised her eyes to the speaker. "Mr. Welland," she said, "does not deserve this suspicion. He never states an untruth. He is an honorable gentleman." 
               "Then you are engaged to him, after all." 
               "I am not. I can't explain it. I have been, but am not." 
               "Tell me the whole, Antonia. Tell me, dear!" 
               "I will tell you as much as I can. We were engaged secretly, but I believed things that were urged against him, and broke off our intercourse. At present we are strangers, and I am promised to Col. Tourtelotte, when the war is over. And now no more on this subject, Emma. No more 'an thou lov'st me.'" 
               With the approach of dinner time the carriage appeared, bearing Mr. Reichenau, who surprised the young ladies in their exchange of confidence, and bade them come with him. Madame la Generale and aunt Margaret were in Fifth Avenue, waiting for them. Antonia retired to dress, and presently they were all three seated in the vehicle, and proceeding to the Reichenau mansion. 
               The dinner was exquisite. Mr. Reichenau did all he could to pay court to Madame la Generale, and Charles allowed himself to be nursed and petted by Emma. Aunt Margaret looked pleased; Antonia was absent-minded. She could not but feel how difficult and complicated her present situation was. She desired to do justice to Tourtelotte, above all to keep her given word. But on the other hand she had treated Welland unjustly, and owed him reparation. And her heart plead loudly for the latter. Who would advise her? To whom could she turn? There was nobody. Not even Mr. Sharp. And yet, if she made a confidant of anybody, it must be of him. These reflections were with her continually, and thanks to the pre-occupation of the others, it was not observed how quiet and buried in thought she was. 
               "Do you know, Madame, that I have imposed a condition on Charles," said Mr. Reichenau. "He is to live one-half the year in New York. I hope this will be an occasion for you to repeat your visit often. It is difficult for me to comprehend how you can muster patience to live in the country." 
               "I am getting old, my dear sir, and age loves quiet." 
               "Not such age as yours. Years do not make old. One person is old at forty, and another young at sixty." 
                
               "Well, I will confess that as yet I do not feel too old to visit New York. But you have not much society here." 
               "Too much, Madame, too much. But the advantages of such a crowd are that you can always find enough among them to suit your taste. Every one picks out his now clique. Do you not feel desirous of re-visiting France?" 
               "Candidly, no. I am afraid of the disappointments." 
               "Even under the regime of Louis Napoleon?" 
               "Even under the regime of the Emperor, I should be disappointed. Things may be greater and brighter, but my eyes are no more the eyes of eighteen and twenty-four. I have conserved the past in my memory, and I am never disappointed, when I recur to that." 
               "I purposed to take my daughter to Paris and have her presented at court, when this war is over. As matters are now I will still do so, if Charles consents to accompany us." 
               "I will," cried Charles from the other side of the room, "on condition that you present us, aunt. You are no stranger in the Tuileries, and the emperor must remember you." 
               "No doubt he would recollect me. He was a child, and I a young lady in a short waist and Grecian coiffure, when he saw me last." 
               "I fancy that it would make no difference ence. Princes rarely forget any but those whom they desire to forget," said Mr. Reichenau. 
               Emma and Charles were having a conversation of their own. 
               "Are you happy now, you craving boy," said Emma to the young man who had possessed himself of her hand. 
               "Quite happy. And can you make up your mind to be content with one who hasn't carried you off by force, and is a pirate or a banditti chief, at least? Or have your ideas moderated?" 
               "It is unpardonable in you to repeat this. I shall get angry." 
               "Wait then, until I have gone to prison. Don't now." 
               "What do you mean? Have you murdered any one?" 
               "Why, my parole expires with returning health. As soon as I am completely well, I must report to the Provost Marshal, and will, in all probability, be sent to a military prison." 
               "It can not be, Charles. You must put off your uniform, and take the oath of allegiance. That will make them leave you free." 
               "You are joking, dear. Not for the world!" replied Charles. 
               "Not for me? You will not refuse my first request." 
               "I must. Think of my honor. You are requesting an impossibility." 
               "What exaggeration to call this an impossibility possibility! I thought you would do any thing for me. Charles, I begin to doubt the strength of your love." 
               "Dispose of my heart and life. They are yours. My honor is mine, and I must keep it bright." 
               "What does your sister say, and your aunt. They object, I feel certain. Do they not?" 
               "They have not said a syllable to keep me, and will not, I'm sure." 
               "But they may exchange you, and then you'll have to fight again! Imagine my feelings in the meantime!" 
               "Emma, your feelings can not influence me in this matter." 
               The young lady looked with admiration at the man, in whom she was beginning to perceive the master. She felt proud of his superiority. 
               Antonia and aunt Margaret were talking in a quiet manner, with great pauses of complete silence. When requested for some music, the young lady began a classic piece, but soon rambled off into fantasies of her own, which no one paid any attention to but aunt Margaret, who thought it very fine. Thus the evening wore, and finally the Goldman party returned in Mr. Reichenau's carriage to the C--. Mammy was in waiting and undressed Madame, while Antonia remained by to talk to her, or rather to listen. It was the old lady's habit to criticize the people she had spent the evening with, while preparing for bed. Nor did she neglect to do so now. 
               "Has Charles retired?" she asked, anxiously. When assured that he had, and that Moses Useful was putting him to bed, she added in a whisper: "For we must be cautious in talking of those people before him. He only half belongs to our family now. It seemed to me as if their manners had infected him a little. How is it, Antonia?" 
               "They have passable manners, aunt. Did you not think so?" 
               "No, I did not. They are very good people, extremely good. Haut bourgoisie, but burgoisie to the core. The middle-aged lady is the best bred, undoubtedly. The father is kind, and adroit in conversation, but there is a certain something, a je ne sais quoi, which smells of the shop about him." 
               "But the young lady is beautiful," said Antonia. 
               "Very beautiful. But her beauty is too loud. And she increases the effect by those bright colors and forward manners." 
               "Which become her, nevertheless. Were you well entertained this afternoon? You went to Central Park, I believe." 
               "Yes, if that can be called a park, which has no trees. Charles amused us greatly by his comments on the passers by, and when that subject was exhausted, he began to make love in a high-flown strain to aunt Margaret, 'as the representative of her niece.'" 
                
               "Will you go there to-morrow? I believe they expect us." 
               "To-morrow we must go and purchase dresses for you, and hats for us both, and other trifles. We are terribly out of fashion, having been excluded from communication with the civilized world for so long a time. So there is labor for us." 
               "Good night, aunt. We breakfast here to-morrow." 
               "Good night, child. Take care of your light. Mammy will assist you." 
               Mammy took off Antonia's clothes and put her to bed. Then she smoothed her hair, and murmured words of tenderness to her darling. And the weary spirit succumbed to the caresses of her old attendant, and after a relieving burst of tears, Antonia sank to sleep, and forgot both Tourtelotte and Welland in the happy land of dreams. Softly the mulatto woman extinguished the light, and left the apartment. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XLV. 
               ABOUT a month after the circumstances related in the preceding chapters, Colonel Welland received two letters. The one, with the delicate lines of a female hand upon the face of the envelope and the monogram A. G. upon the back, scarce deserved the name of letter; it was merely a note. The other, with no end of straight official characters in the direction, was more than a letter; it was a packet. Of course, the note took precedence, and with a sense of happy surprise, Welland perceived that it came from Antonia. It was written closely, on very thin paper, and ran thus: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           DEAR SIR:-I owe you many apologies, and sincerely beg your pardon for an act of misapprehension on my part. Unfortunately, reparation is out of my power. When my brother Charles returned from New York to Pineland, it was with the impression that you were the accepted suitor of Emma Reichenau. This impression he communicated to me with such assurances of its correctness, that I could doubt no longer. Hence the line of conduct I have pursued, for which I sincerely beg your pardon. What influence the fact may have had upon me that you are in arms against my country, I will not attempt to calculate; but I did not expect to see you ever leagued with the oppressors of a nationality battling for its rights. 
                           When I imagined myself free to dispose of my future, in consequence of your own act, I hesitated not to devote that future in some measure to my country. I animated a gallant gentleman, who has long been attached to me, to fight bravely for our Southern rights, by the promise of my hand, in the event of the victorious conclusion of this war. He went forth, and has fought and suffered as our Southern patriots fight and suffer; and while he is in the field, I shall hold the poor guerdon I promised him as faithfully as I can, and whether we are conquerors or conquered at the end of the war, my hand is at his disposal. 
                           Still, when we came to this city in search of Charles, for whom, as you know, we came North, and found him betrothed to Emma Reichenau, I could not help feeling bitter regrets in addition to the pain with which I had regarded my loss. It is sad to meet misfortune and sorrow, but terrible to feel that you yourself are the cause of it, and that it can not be repaired. In consideration of what I have suffered, be generous and do not increase my troubles, by attempts on your part to see me, or cause a change in my intentions. For I must keep my word to Col. Tourtelotte, and shall surely do so. That my brother is happy, and that you are without blame in this affair, are my only consolations. Your truth and nobility of character are comforts to me, even now. 
                           May you be happy. And let me hope, that you will so far be able to obliterate from memory what has passed between us, that when we meet, we need not meet as strangers, but as friends. I have ceased to wish for happiness. I pray for peace. 
                           If this letter is unmaidenly, I can not help it. There are occasions and sentiments that burst through the fetters of custom, and maintain their rights against all laws of demeanor. Good-bye, dear Louis, whom I call so once again, and no more. 
                           
                              A. G.
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               It is impossible to describe the feelings of the Colonel when he had finished this letter. He could not reflect upon the contents, but felt like one stunned. He read it two and three times, and still seemed not to comprehend its full intent. A vague feeling of pain, heavy and dull, was upon him. Mechanically he dropped the sheet of thin paper, and put out his hand for the heavy packet that still lay there unopened. On cutting the envelope, he found a note from the B-- Consul in New York of the following import: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           COLONEL:-The inclosed papers, containing the conclusion of the Bureau of Justice of his Majesty, the King of B--, upon reviewing the case of his Majesty's Government, versus Louis Welland, born in G--, in the Palatinate, by the light of additional testimony, deposed under oath by Frederick Hassel, born in L--, in the Palatinate, are herewith furnished to you for information and guidance, with the remark that the sum alluded to has been placed at the disposal of the under signed, and can be received by you, at his office in New York, against receipts properly signed and attested, and upon establishing your identity to his satisfaction. 
                           
                              SEBASTIAN PFISTER, Consul. 
                              COLONEL LOUIS WELLAND, 
                              -th N. Y. Vols.
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               There were a great many papers. In fact, quite a heap. Welland could make neither head or tail of them at first. But by an extraordinary effort of will, he concentrated his attention upon the subject, and went through them all in regular order. There were accounts of the former trail against him, and the confiscation of his possessions. Again, there were accounts of the points re-considered upon receiving the testimony of Hassel. And finally came a synopsis of that testimony from which it appeared that Hassel and two others had removed the Government money, which Welland took from a party of soldiers in the revolution of 1848 by order of his General, and was afterward forced to conceal in a wood; that Hassel and the others had carried off as much as they could carry of this sum, which was mostly in heavy silver coin, and left the rest in a safe place in the same wood; furthermore, that one of them, venturing to return, had been imprisoned and put to hard labor for firing a farm-house in the revolutionary times, and that the other two were thereby deterred from making the attempt to secure the whole of the money. In conclusion the exact place of concealment was specified, and accurately described, and an humble petition urged that if the money was found, so much of Louis Welland's heritage as had been taken to indemnify Government for this loss, might be restored. 
               Upon search being made, the money was found untouched, except the moiety carried off by Hassel and his companions. The case was accordingly reviewed, and the conclusion arrived at by the Minister of Justice was summed up thus, in brief: 
               "As the said Louis Welland, born in G--, in the Palatinate, has, by the grace of his Majesty, the King, been pardoned of the misdemeanors committed by him against the State, on condition that the losses occasioned to the War Department through his direct agency, be re-paid by the proceeds of the sale of all properties appertaining to him, and the surplus be transmitted to the said Louis Welland, and as the original sum missed has, in great part, been found and restored to the treasury of that Department, it is our opinion ion that so much of the proceeds of his property, as in addition to the restored sum exceed the deficiency occasioned, shall be paid over to him by the Department, in whose treasury it is at present, after a due deduction of just interest, expenses incurred," &c. &c. 
               The king had approved this opinion, and ordered it to be acted upon. The long and the short of the matter was this: Welland had his own again, and was possessor of a considerable fortune. It was only necessary for him to go to New York, indentify himself, sign receipts, and take up his money. 
               When he had finished his perusal of the documents, and the whole case was clear to him, he again picked up his little note from Antonia, and read it over. It filled him with bitterness. "Unmerited suffering seems to be my lot," he said. "I was content to live without her, and had regained my peace after seeing Tourtelotte. Now, to my knowledge, that she is another's, must be added the consciousness that she loves me still!" He folded the note tenderly, and laid it in the little volume which Antonia had given him. 
               "And now, as I am again a rich man, I must secure my wealth, and take care of it," he added, and seating himself at the mess-table, he indited an application for leave of absence. 
               It was granted to him, and he departed for New York. In a day or two his business ness with the Consul was transacted, and a great part of his wealth invested in Government stocks. These were safely deposited in various banks, and then Welland donned his gala uniform to wait upon Miss Reichenau. 
               As he entered the parlor, he saw Emma in a rocking-chair with Charles at her side, but saw no one else. 
               "My heartiest congratulations," he said, joyfully. "And how is the wound getting on?" 
               "Quite well," replied Charles, pressing his hand. "I fear I shall have to report for prison in another week." 
               "Isn't it dreadful, Colonel Welland," said Emma, exchanging hearty greetings with him, "he wants to leave us and go to prison? I am sure it is but a romantic crotchet." 
               "I can not agree with you, notwithstanding all the laws of politeness," said Welland. "The rules of honor are a soldier's conscience." 
               "Oh, of course, you will tell me the same thing Charles does, being both in the army," said Emma. "And ladies are not supposed to have any judgment in military affairs." 
               "We are both in the army, with a slight difference," said Welland, smiling. "I suppose you can communicate with home, Mr. Goldman, since our troops are in your State?" 
               "Yes. We have had letters from Pineland land last week. Both father and mother are well, and have found the Yankees not so terrible as they anticipated." 
               "And Mr. Sharp? I claim him as a friend." 
               "He is well. He rather enjoys the presence of Northern troops." 
               "I come from Tennessee, but have not been near Claiborne County. Hence my inquiries. I have had the pleasure of meeting Madame la Generate lately. I believe she is here now?" 
               "Certainly," cried Emma. "And, bye the bye, here is a friend of yours, buried in her novel, I suppose, behind the curtain like a fairy in the play." She lifted the damask curtain which had been released from the loop and swept the floor. At the window sat Antonia, book in hand. She started up and flushed a bright red, then turned pale as a lily. Welland shook like an aspen leaf. He recovered his composure almost immediately, and advancing to the slight figure in azure and lace, said: 
               "This is an unexpected pleasure. Are you well, Miss Goldman?" 
               "Thank you. Quite well." 
               "It is some time since we met. I carried away the most vivid reminiscences from Tennessee. Indeed I can not think of it, without seeming to inhale the mingled odor of roses and pines." 
               "We have not treated you well. We scarce deserve that you think kindly of us," said Antonia. 
                
               "You refer to the little ebullition of popular feeling which compelled me to leave? I have almost forgotten it. It was nothing personal. Merely a symptom of the coming storm. I can appreciate that now." 
               "Still, you were treated rather roughly I understand," said Charles. "Colonel Tourtelotte told me the whole of it, I think." 
               "The Colonel proved a trusty friend to me at the time," said Welland. 
               Emma had watched both attentively from the first. She had noticed Antonia slip the loop of the curtain when Welland entered. The blushes and trembling did not escape her. And the present conversation was too shallow to hide from her the feelings it was intended to cloak and disguise. 
               "Let me make a gallant disposal of you, Mr. Welland," she said; "I wish to converse with Charles, and give you as chevalier d'honneur to Miss Goldman, to have and to hold, to entertain and to amuse, to attend and to compliment, until-" 
               "Until the dinner bell rings," said Charles. 
               So Welland was put at the side of Antonia, who found herself in great trepidation. But he did not take advantage of his position, and-such is human nature, with its ten thousand weaknesses-she regretted a little that he did not. He managed to keep up a conversation on general topics, talking a good deal himself, and continually ually drawing Charles or Emma in, by referring to them. When Emma saw this, and appreciated that her little plan to unite the lovers-for such she considered them to be-had failed, she arose, opened the piano, and requested the Colonel to sing. He acceded with a good grace, and striking an accompaniment in some sad minor key, sang a German song, full of love and melancholy, full of plaintive mourning for something lost. "It was enough to give one the blues for a week," said Charles pathetically to Emma. But scarce had he concluded it, when, as if struck by a sudden thought, he burst into that brilliant air from Rigoletto, which is the essence of light-hearted carelessness and frivolous ideas of woman. 
               Later, Mr. Reichenau entered, and rejoiced heartily to find Welland. After their first interchange of greetings, the latter said: 
               "I have had a fortune presented to me." 
               "What do you mean," asked the merchant. "A fortune?" 
               Welland gave him an account of his luck, and the means by which it had fallen to him. Reichenau said, that he had known Hassel in connection with Tourtelotte. 
               All that evening, and for several days to come, Antonia and Welland preserved the cool, unconcerned appearance of friends, whenever they met in the presence of others. They never saw each other alone, until til the day before Welland's departure. Then, as it happened, he called to take leave of Madame la Generale. She was indisposed, and he found Antonia in the sitting-room. He talked about indifferent matters in a quick nervous way, and she replied in short agitated sentences. At last he rose to take leave. 
               "Present my respectful adieus to Madame," he said. "If the fortune of war should leave me alive, I hope to find her still in New York, when these troubles are over. Mrs. Goldman intends to come here, I believe." 
               "Yes. She has written to us." 
               "Should I have the opportunity of visiting Pineland, I shall indulge in happy reminiscences of the days I spent there formerly. Good-bye." 
               "Good-bye," said she, taking his hand and holding it. "Have you received my letter?" 
               "I have," he replied, stopping and gazing into her sea-blue eyes. 
               She cast them down. "And have you forgiven?" She asked, almost inaudibly. 
               "Where I would have gladly sacrificed my life, I am willing to sacrifice my happiness," he replied, in a very serious tone. "Though the one is worth little, without the other." 
               "Do you know that you are speaking very cruel words?" she asked. 
               "Do you know that you have done a very cruel thing?" he replied. 
                
               She hung her head. "Oh, if I could do as I would!" she murmured. 
               "Every one can do as he will. As for you, Miss Goldman, you have acted-and if not in accordance with your will, if merely in obedience to circumstances, I pity you. A disciplined mind should resist the influence of circumstances. Good-bye." And he went. 
               "He despises me! Oh God!" and the poor girl sat down and cried heartily. "Perhaps it is better so. He will not regret me much. While I, oh, I adore him!" 
               Time passed. Charles went to prison and was exchanged. Tourtelotte, exchanged at the same time, led some of the boldest raids of the war. The Goldmans resided now mainly in New York, except Mr. Sharp, who took care of the estate and Mrs. Goldman, who made long visits to be in the way of news from Charles. Welland did not take another leave of absence. His faithful services were rewarded by the grade of Brigadier General. He communicated frequently with Mr. Reichenau, but never inquired about the Goldmans, except transmitting his respects to the family. He was growing rapidly into a stern, serious man, of the confirmed heavy bachelor type, whose face was rarely illumined by a smile. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XLVI. 
               THE war was over. The Southern troops, deprived of their arms, were sent home in detachments, after having passed "sub jugum," that is, taken their parole. The South was filled with mourning and consternation at the success of the hated Yankees, and yet there was a general feeling of relief, because the long and harrowing war was over. The people succumbed peacefully to the measures imposed by the North, but it was with the peace born of utter exhaustion. They suffered and suffered in silence, because they imagined that the North would rejoice to hear their groans. They had ruined themselves completely. Every able-bodied man had served in the field. Every one left at home, raised corn for the army. The cotton and tobacco was burnt, to keep it from the Yankees. The horses had been drafted or carried off. Their Government scrip was not worth the paper it was printed on. Their woolen stuffs, even down to carpets, had been cut up for army blankets. Their negroes were free, and had in many cases assumed a hostile attitude. And their proud patriotic ladies walked to the Provost Marshal's office to take the oath of allegiance, in order to secure rations for their little ones. These facts, with the quarter of a million of Southern graves studding the land, might well have planted despair in the hearts of those that loved the South with that passionate devotion, so characteristic of the nature of her sons. 
               It had made an old man of Frank Tourtelotte. When he came back to Claiborne County, and in the public streets his own negroes met their former strict and sometimes violent master with an impertinent laugh, it turned his soul to gall. When he rode over the lands of his estate and saw them lying fallow, and noticed the look of desolation which had crept over them; when he contemplated his house going to ruin for want of repairs, and the stumps of the stately trees, all of which had been cut down because a Northern Captain had thought it a military necessity to do so; when he recollected that, beside all this, there were mortgages on the land, and claims on the harvests for two years to come; when he reflected on the impossibility of escaping ruin, utter ruin every way he turned-then Frank Tourtelotte was not far from despair, and more than once did he regret not having fallen, while bravely fighting for the liberties and rights of his State. A feeling, which took possession of him more and more, was the desire to go away, to leave the land where it had become impossible for him to live in content. He at first imagined that all the South shared his own bitterness, and from day to day he hoped to hear of uprisings and guerrilla bands, and a predatory sort of warfare. But as the people submitted without a struggle, as the oath was taken far and wide, he began to despise his own section, and encouraged a sort of misanthropy, the leading sentiment of which was hatred and contempt of every American, North or South. 
               It was in this state of feeling he met Mr. Sharp. 
               "Ah, Colonel Tourtelotte," cried the old man. "Glad to see you back again. I congratulate you on the return of peace." 
               "Save your congratulations, sir, for those that rejoice in peace; but don't bother me!" 
               "Don't be angry with me, Colonel; you mustn't make your friends suffer, because the North was too much for the South." 
               "My friends? I have not the honor to count Mr. Sharp among them," retorted Tourtelotte, in the worst of humors. 
               "Never mind. I give you leave to take that honor; for I intend to be a friend to you, Colonel." 
               "And give me advice, I suppose. Thank you, I don't need any." 
               "No, not advice, but money. What do you say to that?" 
               "That I do not believe it. Good day, sir," and he turned to go. 
               But Sharp detained him. "Don't be so hasty, Colonel. I am an honest man, and one of feeling. I can imagine how irritating the present condition of affairs must be to you. I have thought it over, and as a business man and a neighbor. I have determined to give you my opinion. Please do not treat me so roughly, however, for you will frighten every idea out of my head." 
               "If I have treated you roughly, I beg your pardon," returned Tourtelotte, resuming the suavity of manner habitual to him. "The camp has spoiled our manners, and we can not put off the customs of military life as readily as we can the uniform. I am waiting to listen to you, sir, if you have any thing to communicate." 
               They sat down in a bow window of the hotel at Sycamore. There was nobody else in the room but a negro boy asleep on a chair. Sharp ordered drinks, and when they had arrived, cleared his throat several times, and said: 
               "You imagine that I am more pleased at this termination of the war than you are. You are mistaken. I am not. All our negroes are gone as well as yours. And if your fields lie uncultivated for want of hands, so do the fields of Pineland this summer. And why do you not have hands, and why do we not have any? Because we are unable to pay for them. You have lost money, and we have lost immense sums, and we are not as well able to stand it as you, I believe." 
               "I do not see why you are describing this condition which every gentleman in the South shares at the present moment. Every one, except, perhaps, Mr. Goldman. For he is rich, and not likely to have sacrificed his interests to his politics." 
               "You are mistaken. Mr. Goldman sold all his Northern stocks before the war, and invested in Southern bonds. He has lost immensely. I have advised him to sell Pineland, and go into business in New York, where he is at present with his family." 
               "Yes. I thought it strange, that they had not returned before this. I imagined on account of Charley. But who will buy Southern estates now? With confiscation hanging over our head, and no hands to be got to work in the fields." 
               "Confiscation is nonsense. No estates will be confiscated. And those that have money, can import German and Irish laborers." 
               "Have you heard of any one willing to buy?" 
               "I have. And I am even an authorized agent of a New York merchant for that purpose. Thus you see that my present conversation with you is not wholly disinterested." 
               "I thought the cloven foot would show," said Tourtelotte, with a laugh. "Especially when you were so persistent." 
               "You wrong me. Though not wholly disinterested myself, as I confess, yet what I have in my mind, is also for your advantage. I can readily show you that." 
               "My dear Mr. Sharp, remember that I listen to you from pure courtesy, and not because I have the slightest idea of heeding your advice. If you must talk then, make it short, I sincerely pray. My temper has been tried sorely of late." 
                
               "My dear Colonel, remember that I talk to you from pure kindness and neighborly feeling, which may be mistaken, but are sincere. As for any profit, it is not enough to merit my attention. I thank God, that I have enough invested in French stocks to purchase a quarter of a dozen of Southern estates and run them." 
               "I am glad to hear it; you have been fortunate," said Tourtelotte, with much envy, and a great deal more deference; he was impressed in his own despite by the means of the little old man. "Let us hear what you have to propose." 
               "First of all, I wish to get your permission to state your case as a lawyer would, without fear and favor." 
               "Very well. I am desirous of hearing what view a business man of Mr. Sharp's calibre will take of my affairs." 
               "Well then: Your estate is mortgaged for two thirds its value." 
               "How do you know that?" asked Tourtelotte, flushing angrily. 
               "What sort of an agent should I make, if I didn't?" smiled Sharp. "The two first harvests are also mortgaged." 
               "You are insulting me, sir. I will not bear it, even from an old man." 
               "But for God's sake, Colonel, I am merely talking business! Shall I say your estate is free from debt, thriving and productive? Just consider for a moment! I am stating a case, and business is not courtesy." 
                
               "Very well. I was hasty. Please continue, sir." 
               "As matters are at present, our negroes are gone, and no working hands to be had. Capital is scarce. And those who have it, find more profitable investments than lending it to Southern landlords. But it will not be long before our creditors of the North appear and pounce on us. They will require their interests for the four years of the war, and perhaps their capital. Wherewith shall we pay them? Whence is the money to come? Many of us will be ruined; a great many will be ruined." 
               "It is a sad fact," replied Tourtelotte, moodily. "But, what help?" 
               "Wait a moment. Our social affairs are scarcely better. Our houses are dilapidated. Our furniture has been carried off by the negroes. I have seen a white damask sofa that came from the parlor of the Armisteads, used for a cot in a negro cabin; their lace curtains turned into shawls for darkey women, and the nigger babies play with a book of their rarest engravings." 
               "It is horrible; it makes my blood boil. I should have brained the wretches." 
               "Yes. But the wretches were in the majority. Well: the State will fill up with Northern merchants, and Western farmers. They will crowd the old blood out completely. They will buy our land, and cultivate it more successfully than we ever did. They will rule at the polls. In short, the Southern gentleman will be a character to ridicule, perhaps pity, but never again to lead. He is a thing of the past. With Lee's surrender, his death warrant was signed." 
               "The devil take you for this picture," cried the other, violently. "And if it were so, what help for it except a man drive a bullet through his brain? Why do you tell me all this?" 
               "To show that there are but two alternatives. The Southern gentleman, as such, must disappear. That is an accomplished fact. If you remain on the soil, you will sink into a rank far below the Northern invader. This gentleman, if he can do so, should go to France or England and create for himself a position there. If not, let him go North, enter into commerce, and compete with the Northerner on his own ground. I have advised Mr. Goldman to do the latter." 
               "I can not do that. I am not fit for commerce. And I will not descend to that. If I were not connected with the Goldmans-" 
               "You mean Antonia?" 
               Tourtelotte nodded moodily. 
               "Will you permit me a word on that subject?" asked Sharp cautiously. 
               "Talk on." 
               "Well, it seems to me that present circumstances should dissolve that connection. Of course, I know nothing but the practical aspect of the affair." 
               "You mean that I am too poor to marry her? Do you speak with authority? Is that the drift of your talk?" 
               "Neither the one, nor the other. You are not too poor to marry her, as Mr. Goldman himself is quite as poor, though his estate is not mortgaged. I have no authority whatever for my opinions, except common sense. But where are you going to take her, and how are you going to live in comfortable style, and who will pay the debts on the estate, and furnish the funds to work it? Consider that, Colonel." 
               "I depended on Mr. Goldman for funds to pay off the mortgages and work the ground," returned Tourtelotte. 
               "And he would furnish them to his son-in-law if he could," said Sharp, "but ready money he has none." 
               "Still Antonia will have much when Madame Outon dies." 
               "Don't depend on her. She will found some charitable institution to commemorate Napoleon with most of her money, and as for the rest-if she gives any to Antonia, you know she loves you not." 
               "Still she could not help giving Antonia a considerable sum." 
               "Perhaps. But tied up, and secured to her children, with a life interest for her. She is very provident, Madame is." 
               "Well sir, we have gotten on a delicate subject. Let us drop it. I am much obliged for what you have told me. One more question, if you please." 
               "Any number, Colonel. I am at your service." 
                
               "How much could I get for my estate as it is? And-and could no other arrangement but that of a sale be suggested?" 
               Sharp reflected. "For the estate with its encumbrances," he said, slowly, "I could give -- dollars. As far as another arrangement is concerned, I would be ready to take it, I think, in lease for ten years, pay off the mortgages in that time, improve it generally, and give an annual rent of -- dollars. With capital to work it well, I think I might do that profitably." 
               "And keep up the old house?" 
               "And keep up the old house. When you have thought of this, please let me know." 
               "I will. Thank you. Good morning, Mr. Sharp." 
               Tourtelotte mounted his horse, and rode off. The offers made by Mr. Sharp, exceeded his expectations by far. Accepting either one of them, he would be able to live on the continent-say in Paris or Rome, not only in comfort, but in good style. He might leave the country, where life had become to him bitter as gall. Perhaps in foreign service, perhaps in foreign society there might be distinction and honor in store for him. But not in America. There his part was played. 
               As for Antonia Goldman, she had become an impossibility. That was clear. He could not descend to commerce and work day after day in the slow and devious paths, where dollars are gathered by taking ing advantage of your neighbors. No, he must resign her. Circumstances had parted them. After all, she had only promised to be his if the South prove victorious. In reality, they were not engaged at all. 
               It was a sign of the sad condition to which troubles and irritations combined with real misfortune had reduced Frank Tourtelotte, that he could give up Antonia. The man was, in truth, bowed down, in a state of utter dejection and misanthropy, hating his country and his countrymen. He was as near broken-hearted as such a man could be. 
               That day he wrote two letters. The one was addressed to Antonia, the other to Sharp. The first ran thus: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           DEAREST ANTONIA:-Fate is stronger than mortals. The misfortunes which have destroyed the South, have also wrecked my heart and fortune. I am not in a condition to ask for that hand, for the possession of which I would willingly have resigned my life. I shall leave this land, probably never to return. In foreign climes I shall seek to forget that my country is a captive and a slave, and that Antonia can not be mine. You are free, dearest and best beloved. I nullify your promise, because I think more of you than of myself-who is not fit now to brighten the life of a sweet innocent girl. Farewell, Antonia. I shall always love you and the South, though I have resigned both. 
                           
                              FRANK TOURTELOTTE.
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               The other letter was to Mr. Sharp. The contents were these: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                              MR. SELLINGTON SHARP:
                            
                           DEAR SIR:-Your proposition, regarding the ten years lease, I accept herewith, on condition that -- dollars are paid to me at once, over and above your offer. Please forward the inclosed letter to Miss Antonia Goldman, and communicate your answer to the above as soon as convenient. 
                           
                              Respectfully, 
                              FRANK TOURTELOTTE.
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               In the evening, he wrote a long letter to a cousin in Louisiana, acquainting him with his resolve and the reasons for it, and requesting that his cousin, Miss Tourtelotte, might find a home in his house. If not, he should take her with him. But he hoped the latter would not be necessary, as his own means were greatly straightened. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XLVII. 
               IT was a few days before that on which Charles was to be married. Emma Reichenau had gone through the form of conversion to her future husband's faith. The Goldman family was delighted and grateful in consequence. This was chiefly due to Welland, who smoothed the way on both sides. Since his return from the war, with a Brigadier General's straps on his shoulders, he had resided in New York, and resumed his former intimacy with the Reichenaus and Goldmans. But toward Antonia he maintained a coldness which was all the more chilling from a studied attention to the minutest dictates of social etiquette. She responded to it by a manner of reserved ed but reproachful sadness. In arranging the matter of the conversion, Welland had said to Mrs. Goldman: 
               "It is merely a custom, and not a positive law that Israelites should not intermarry with Gentiles. Even in the case of idolaters the bible, after urging that attempts be made to change the lover's mind, permits it, if such attempts prove fruitless. Moses himself married a Heathen woman, Solomon wedded the daughter of the Egyptian king, and Leah and Rachel, when Jacob wooed them, prayed to idols. It is probable that all these accepted their husband's faith after a while, but nowhere is mention made of any positive conversion, or any form used." 
               "Is it not considered a sin in the bible?" asked Mrs. Goldman. 
               "It does not seem to have been. For in the instance of Ruth, a Moabite woman, her having been married to a Jew, is mentioned without any blame being attached to the act." 
               "But it is so ancient a custom." 
               "Yes. But many more ancient customs have been disregarded of late, and the heavens have not fallen. Beside, it is perhaps not so ancient as you think. When the Israelites first left the holy land and scattered over the earth, in all probability, they intermarried with the nations among whom they settled." 
               "How do you know that it is so?" 
               "By the laws against it, which were enacted in various lands some time after. A law against any practice, always presupposes such a practice to have existed." 
               "That would scarce seem sufficient evidence," replied Mrs. Goldman. "You know that it is held our race has kept pure." 
               "Such an opinion is perhaps flattering, but not true. I will give you physiological evidence. Whence come the blue and gray eyes, and the red and yellow hair among these pure descendants of the Orient? Whence the fair complexions? Climate will never do that to such an extent." 
               To Emma, Welland said: 
               "God is God, whether adored in the Jewish, Christian or Mohammedan manner. For your husband's love, and the peace of your married life, go through the form of adopting the Jewish faith. It is but a different method of adoring the same Creator. You are not abandoning any thing old or accepting any thing new. The dogmas, moral teachings, and social precepts are the same in spirit. The ceremonies only are different. Do it as a manifestation of your love for Charles and his parents." 
               And so it was done. 
               For the young couple, the day of the wedding was also the one of departure. They were to be married at twelve; receive their friends till two; and start for Europe at three. Mr. Reichenau accompanied them, and General Welland, desirous of re-visiting his native land, had taken passage on the same steamer. Aunt Margaret was to be the guest of the Goldmans during her brother's stay in Europe, and the Fifth Avenue mansion would be shut up. As for Welland's bachelor rooms, he said, that he would lock them up and take Ned with him to Europe. 
               When, on the appointed day, the hour of noon drew nigh, the interior of that Jewish temple, in which the ceremony was to be performed, presented a gay appearance. The seats near the pulpit were filled by the friends of the parties. Ladies in silks of all tints, from the most delicate white to the deepest orange, with lace shawls and diamonds, filled the pews, while gentlemen in full dress stood behind them. A Rabbi awaited the couple. He was seated in the pulpit. 
               The doors opened, and Mr. Goldman entered, leading Madame la Generale in magnificent silver gray satin, with Brussels, and diamonds, and pearls. The lace of her cap was worth a fortune. Mrs. Goldman followed, leaning on Mr. Reichenau's arm. Then came Antonia, led by Mr. Sharp, who was in wonderfully fashionable trim. And last of all, Welland escorting aunt Margaret. They took seats quite near the pulpit, but did not stand up, as Charles had declined all assistance of that sort, and declared that he would stand up alone. 
               The organ played a prelude, and the happy couple entered. Charles was uncovered, but Emma's head drooped under the vail and orange blossoms. She was leaning on his arm, and with steady quick steps, they walked up the aisle and paused in front of the pulpit, where the Rabbi awaited them. The ceremony was gone through with, and the blessing pronounced. The newly married couple shook hands, and left in. the same manner, in which they had entered. Then followed the relatives; and finally, the invited guests, those nearest the pulpit walking out first. 
               It so happened, that in re-entering the carriages, Mr. Sharp caused a good deal of confusion in his party. Madame la Generale and Mrs. Goldman, with Mr. Reichenau and Mr. Goldman, were seated in one. Then Mr. Sharp handed Antonia into another, and detaining aunt Margaret, begged Welland to enter. The General bowed, and did so. No sooner was he seated, than Mr. Sharp gave a letter to Antonia, and slamming the door, signed the driver to go on. Himself with aunt Margaret, he deposited in the next vehicle. 
               Welland looked out, and seemed to feel vexed at this forced tete a tete. Antonia in confusion, saw no better escape than reading the letter Sharp had given her. It was Tourtelotte's. When she had finished it, she said: 
               "Noble gentleman!" and with a grand gesture, gave the letter to Welland. 
               He bowed, and read it. When he had finished, his face showed much agitation. But he said nothing in reply to her inquiring glance. Driven by the importance of the opportunity, which was passing away with every step the horses made, she said softly: 
               "What do you say to that, Louis Welland?" 
               "It is not for me to express an opinion, Miss Goldman," he replied, coldly. "But if you wish it-I think such noble sentiments should be rewarded." 
               "Rewarded? Aye. If I could do so without sacrificing a life's happiness." 
               "It is easier to sacrifice the happiness of others, than one's own." 
               "Have I merited this reproach?" she asked, sadly. "Perhaps I have, but if so, I am sufficiently punished." 
               "If I have said aught to offend you, I beg your pardon," he replied, coldly. "Have you any commissions for Europe? You know that I go with this afternoon's steamer." 
               "I have none. I do not believe that you like America sufficiently ever to return. Do you?" 
               "Yes. I shall return when I get tired of drifting about without aim or purpose. But here we are. Permit me to assist you. You have forgotten the Colonel's letter." 
               He picked it up, and handed it to her. She took it, and entered the house. The bridal couple were stationed in the embrasure of a window. The nearest relatives stood to their right and left. The guests passed in, offered their congratulations, and out at another door into the sitting-room, where the presents were displayed, and the dining-room where a cold collation and champagne awaited them. 
               Mrs. and Miss DeWolf were among the foremost. The elder lady advanced with great dignity, and gave three fingers to the groom, two to the bride, and one to Antonia. 
               "I wish you joy," she said. "You look so well in white satin and laces, that you should get married once a year at least." 
               "If you will engage to kill off my old husbands, and provide me with new," replied Emma, "I will even do so." 
               "How horrible to think of killing, when you have just been married!" exclaimed Miss DeWolf. "Are you not afraid, Mr. Goldman?" 
               "Not in the least. Though I join you in the wish that Emma may postpone the idea of killing me, for a little while." 
               "Wish you joy! Wish you joy," said Merrins. "Much better hands to fall into than old Mr. Hygood's. Though he is a good man. One of the best men in the world. Happy to make the acquaintance of Reichenau & Co. Known by reputation. Though we have not transacted business with each other." 
               And so on. Madame la Generale entertained the French Consul and his lady. Mr. Goldman and his wife had asked some old New Orleans friends, whom they had found in New York. Mr. Reichenau paid court to the business men. Antonia was supporting a conversation with some young men of fashion, when Sharp motioned her away. 
               "Well? Are you satisfied with the letter, child?" 
               "Yes, thank you. Col. Tourtelotte is a noble gentleman." 
               "Is all arranged? What is the matter?" 
               "Nothing. General Welland prefers to adhere to his original intention of going to Europe, and I bade him God speed!" 
               "Bosh and nonsense!" and the old man steamed off in search of Welland. 
               "Permit me to say, General," he whispered, with great emphasis, "with all possible excuses for my opinion, that you are an ass." 
               "An opinion is subjective," replied Welland, "and every body has a right to his own. Perhaps I am." 
               "I know you are. A proud, obstinate fellow, who can not see his own advantage, or will not take it." And he turned away. 
               An hour passed. The happy pair withdrew, and got ready to go to the steamer, accompanied by a number of their friends. Antonia was there, taking leave of them. Leaning on the bulwarks, stood Welland with his hat off. The wind blew his black hair back from his forehead, and his dark eyes shone, out of a face pale and serious. He shared the adieus of the bridal party. When Antonia shook hands with him, she could not master the expression of her sea-blue eyes. A glance full of reproach, sorrow and disappointment fell upon him, a glance that trembled with hopeless yearning, and seemed loath to leave his face. In the next moment she had turned, embraced Charles and Emma, and left the steamer with her parents. Mr. Sharp, however, again approached Welland, and went through a growling "Good-bye. My last opinion of you is confirmed!" before he left. 
               Antonia's last look haunted Welland. He said to himself, that a woman who had once broken her promise, was unworthy of further trust. He reasoned, that it would be folly to expect love and confidence, for life in one who could doubt him on such slight premises. He assured himself that doubt killed love, as the frost nips flowers. And yet, notwithstanding all his reasoning, he felt the old love strong within him, and knew that he could never be very happy away from Antonia. 
               And the breeze blew freshly, and the waves of the harbor danced in the sunlight, and the steamer left a snowy trail of foam as it made its way oceanward. 
               Charles and Emma approached, both with the light of happiness in their eyes. 
               "You are going to Europe, General, to select a she-General I suppose," said Charles, laughing. "I believe I am permitted mitted to make such remarks, being a married man." 
               "Of two hours standing," said Emma. "And I shall make use of my privilege as matron to look out a match for you. You have disappointed me sadly, General. I thought you would be engaged before this." 
               "To whom?" asked Charles. "May I know?" 
               "No, you may not. Unless you guess," replied Emma. 
               "Miss DeWolf? Isn't it?" 
               "Horrible. Though I believe you admired her yourself." 
               "Well, I did, I will confess, and perhaps do still." 
               "I will apply for a divorce the moment we arrive." 
               "Beware of jealousy! You are a perfect female Othello." 
               And they strolled on. The features of Charles transfigured with happiness, recalled all the charms of Antonia to Welland's mind, and his heart began to long and yearn with a hunger that would not be satisfied or turned away by reasoning. Onward sped the steamer, and every revolution of the wheels carried him further from her. When he could return, where would she be? Would her affection for him endure the chill of disappointment? Might not some one else--this thought was torture. He paced the deck with quick steps. Suddenly he heard a noise alongside, and saw the pilot descending into his boat and preparing to cast off. At the same time Mr. Reichenau appeared, and asked him to go down to dinner. With a hasty adieu he left his astonished friend, and hurried over the ship's side into the pilot boat. 
               "Where in heaven's name are you going?" asked the astonished merchant, leaning over the bulwarks. 
               "Back to New York," replied Welland, in a joyous voice. "Good-bye," and he waved his hand. 
               The little boat was dancing on the waves, and the huge wheels of the steamer resumed their rapid revolutions. On, to the shores of the old world went the one, back to the metropolis of the new, the other. It was late in the night when the pilot boat reached the wharf. Welland did not go to his rooms, but paced the streets till morning. Then he took a bath. He tried to breakfast, but could not. It was impossible for him to remain quiet. It seemed as if the forenoon would never wear away. At last it struck eleven. He immediately presented himself at the C--, and sent his card up to Antonia. She came down with a pale, scared face, and asked, trembling violently: 
               "Has a misfortune happened?" 
               "Not unless you consider my return a misfortune," he replied, smiling brightly. 
                
               "But how did you come here. I thought you went with Charles." 
               "I did, but returned on the pilot boat." 
               She drew a long breath, and relieved from her anticipations of an accident, ventured to look at him with greater attention. 
               His face was flushed. His eyes eagerly sought hers, and there was a certain expression in his smile, which called the blushes into her countenance, and made her cast down her eyes. He went to her, and tenderly took her hands. 
               "Antonia," he said, "I judged you harshly. In my pride I thought to resign you. But I felt that with you I resigned my happiness. Dear girl, will you pardon a repentant heart? Antonia, will you be my wife?" 
               And she replied, gently and humbly: 
               "I will, Louis," and laid her head upon his bosom. 
               Then he folded his arms around her, and kissed her sweet brow. 
               "United in love," he said, "notwithstanding former differences." 
               "United forever," she replied. 
             
            THE END.
