CHAPTER         I.
THE NUN' S FLIGHT.
IT was a glorious night in May, of the year
15-. The moon from an unclouded sky
threw great masses of light on the rustling
woods,the leafy hills,and the white gleaming
walls of the convent of St. Ursula. The
whisper of the trees and the distant splash
of a babbling brook were the only sounds,
that mingled   with, and enhanced  the
dreamy silence, which covers earth, and
air, and sky late at night. Very dark were
the woods around the convent, and the pur-
plish silver, which the moonlight poured on
them, penetrated not farther than the leafy
summits. A feeling of loneliness and awe
that checks all admiration, they might else
awaken, is created by these silentgrandeurs
of night, and the bright cold moonshine
strews a ghostly glitter over natures's face.
The bells of the convent had poured their
sounds into the dark chestnut woods, to an.
nounce the hour of one, when a window in
the rear of the convent opened,and the figure
of a nun appeared, at the casement. The
long black robes of the order closely envel-
oped her form, but the large white veil, as
well as the unshapely cap, were thrown
back anddiselosed aface ofwonderfulbeauty.
Features of exquisite loveliness, but on which
dwelt tle cold and severe expression of mar.
ble; Cyes of glorious and diamond-like ra-
dianpe, with slight but intensely black
brows; and hair of a glossy purplish-black
hue, that hung in large and damp waves
down her back, beneath the upper garments;
all combined to give a haughty and cold, but
gloriously beautiful appearance to thenun.
She again closed the window, and pro.
needed by the light of the moon, which

poured a stream of radiance through every
casement and oriflce, through long galleries
and vaulted halls, past the small black doors
of cells and the glittering images of saints
and martyrs, now unlocking some door with
extreme caution, then swinging back an
iron grate that barred her way, until she ar-
rived at the chamber close to the chapel. In
this room, entered the nuns, as they were
received into the convent after taking the
veil, and laying aside the gorgeous garments
in which they for the last time had been at-
tired, assumed the sable costume of the sis-
ters. The garments and jewels, they laid
aside, were kept in a large closet, in the
corner of the room, which, containing many
valuable ornaments, was 'securely locked.-
The nun, taking a key from the black bag
hanging at her girdle, unlocked it, and be
gan, by the light of the moon to examine the
various garments that hung from the hooks.
She selected a robeof white satin gorgeously
embroidered with gold,and edged with white
fur; an under dress of gold and silver bro-
cade, and a chatalaine, or girdle of jewels,
which,. after spanning the waist, almost
reached the ground. A wreath of white ro-
ses and a diamond necklace were taken from
one of the drawers in the closet, and then the
nun relocked the wardrobe.
"My bridal costume," she murmured, as
with quick hands, taking ofi'the robes of the
contvent, she attired herself in the rich gar-
ments and jewels we have mentioned.- Then,
with a proud step, entering the chapel, the
beautiful woman swept to the altar, where
pale tapers were burning around a golden
cross.
"Long enough," she exclaimed; "long
enough have I been chained to the foot of the

"They are encamped on-the platform  be-i
low, Sefta," replied the gipsy.
The Indyturnedand beheld on the plat-
form, the encampment of the gipsies. In
the midst of the olive copse, a space of about
sixty' feet in diameter had been cleared.
This elaring was surrounded by tent cloth,
suspended from one tree to another. In the
midst of it burned a large fire, and above the
daies hung an enormous kettle suspended
from a stick, that was held in the branchings
of two'upright poles. Savory steams arose,
whenever a cone with an orange-colored,
shriveled up face, who held'the important
office of cook, lifted .the cover of the kettle
and stirred its contents with a wooden ladle.
Then would the brown -children that, almost
entirely naked, surrounded the fire, utter
yells of joy 'ii anticipation of the coming
meal; and even their parents who were lol-
ling in the laziest attitudes,.eA the ground,
would make impatient movements, or urge
the old crone to finish her task, by some flat-
tering remark. 
It was a beautiful picture. The gipsies,
with their dark complexion, raven hair, but
gaudily colored habiliments,laying around
,the' bright flashing fire, with the dark see-,
thidg mysterious looking pot hanging over it;
the tent, cloth draped in loose folds, from
branch to branch; the intensely dark green
olive wooi'beyond, all motionless:and silent;
and, above all, the beautiful blue sky with
its stars and golden moon.
The lady then entered the cave, followed
by Massor, and set down on the couch of
Olin s.,I
"Our plans are all arranged; and it is only
necessary now, for you, Senora, to promise
strict adherence to my directions. In the
altered-position you will occupy, should our
pltns succeed, immense power is at your
disposal. The exercise ' of this power I will
require once in a while, for my own benefit,
or the benefit of my friends," -
"I am  ready to yield such aid to you, in
reward&amp;r your services," replied the lady.
"Thltis all; and now Iwill leave-you to
rest, for a few hours. Good night, Donna
O oria," and the gipsy left the cavern. I
At the mention of her name the lady star-

tedland sunk back into deep-revery, which;
was finally broken, by a shout of the gipsies
below. She rose slowly, murmuring:
"Massor is right; Sister Fia hasdisappear-
ed forever, and DONNA GLORIA DA GoEZzen-
ters-theworld again. It is very lonelyhere,"
she added, looking up  t-the rocky projec-
tions encrdsted with cry tals, that reflected
the light of the fire in bright colors. From
the walls'the moss hung in fringe-like ten-
drils,and' as the fresh night wind wavedithese
delicate plants, they cast large and ghostly
shadows over the rocks. The cave was al-
ways aL rather chilling and lonely place, ek-
cept perhaps to naturalists; and at' height,
with a fitful fire chasing the darknets over
the walls; the air lifting the feathery mosses
and'waking faint moans from the holes ind
crevices of the roof; with, the dark branches
bending and creaking around the entrance,
it was peculiarly lonely and sad. Doina
Gloria, by which name we shall designate
her, seemed to think so, and, therefore, drew
the bed of skins-to the mouth of the cave,
from whence se could witness the gambols
and the conversation of the gipsies in the
campbelow.
ThAy had finished supper, and the empty
kettle testified the justice done to the meal.
One ofsthem, a handsome young fellow occu
pied a prominent position at the fire,and was
preparing to comply witly the request of the
others, and to tell a story.
"I do not remember any story at present,"
he began, "but I will relate to you an occur-
rence that happened several years ago, and
in which I took a part."
One of the gipsies trimmed the fire, while
the others composed themselves to listei.-
A haze of of glittering sparks shot out info
the darkness, and a bright tongue of flame
east a momentary light over the quiet-woods.
After a moment of hesitation the gipsy be-
gan.
"It may now be four years ago, since I
followed the trade of beggar in the renown-
ed city of Coimbra. It is a rich town, an4
the residence of many noble families; in-
deed, there,asweet-voiced beggar ata church

. ion, bad to leave the city. However to th
tale.
"A noble family by the name of Gom
lived there; they were not wealthy, but e
ceedingly proud, and good reason they ha
to be so, for their blood was of the noble
in Portugal. Opposite to the Universit
lived Donna Maria da Gomez, who was
widow, and ner only daughter Donna GT(
ina. Oh, but Donna Gloria was a beautify
maiden, and proud like a queen. She ha
an uncle, who was a bishop, and a steri
severe man,thathad no mercy with the fault
of others, and believed himself faultless; h
superintended her education, and kept he
almost as close as a nun. Well, I often beg
ged at the door of the University. On
morning Don Diego da Azambuja, the soi
and heir of the old duke, eyed me for som
moments, and then skid: "Thou art a smar
fellow, I believe."
I bowed, and replied modestly: thanl
your highness for the compliment," at th
same time extending my palm.
"I am willing to reward thee well,for eas2
service" he continued,dropping a gold piece
into my hand.
"The holy saints bless your highness;I
will poignard the first noble in the land, a-
your word," I ejaculated, gratefully, think
ing ofcourse that he required some servic
of this sort. But Don Diego turning quite
red, said, with a slightly stammering voice
"Silence fellow; dost know Donna Gloria da
Gomes ?'
"Do I know the greatest beauty of Portu-
gal? She drops a piece of money into my
hand, every morning at the church door.-
Oh she is kind and beautiful!" He seemed
much pleased at my reply.
"Take this note and deliver it into her
hands to-morrow morning." And he left a
. letter tied with silver thread in my hands.
"The Donna shall receive it," was my re-
Ply.
"Next morning I waited at the church
door, and when Donna Gloria dropped, as
usual,apieee of money into my hand, I slip-
pad the letter into her wide sleeve. She
turned scarlet and passed on. The morning

as- after, I left another letter from Don Diego in
he her sleeve,and on the third dayshe dropped
a small rose colored note and a large gold
ez piece into my hand. The piece I kept,.and
x- the letter was delivered to Don Diego, who
d rewarded me richly. This correspondence

e I was mistaken. It only grew the more fre-

of Donna Gomez's house, when the proces-
k sionreturned from the city hall; nextdaythey
e were to be married in church. She was at-
tired in a robe of white satin blazing with
y gold embroidery, and fringed with white fur.
e An underdress of gold brocade glittered in
front, where the skirts were open and looped,
I with diamond clasps. Her beautiful hair
t was adorned with a wreath of white roses,
and a diamond necklace flashed on her swan
D like throat. Oh, she looked divinely beau-
a tiful.
:  "And Don Menezes walked at her side,his
face beaming with joy. A rich dress of
purple velvet slashed and - lined with
cloth of gold, admirably adorned his fine
person. A string of pearls hung around his
headgear, on one side of which, threecuperb
plumes were held by a diamond brooch.-
His sword also hung from a jeweled belt.

and all the neighborhood resounded with the

distributed to us; the bridegroom had even
ordered wine,and all mendicants of Coimbra
made merry.
"Suddenly I felt some one touch my shoul-

sorrow where the eve before, joy had dwel-

"Don Menezes returned to Ormus and died,
a twelvemonth after, in battle. But: the
bishop, Donna Gloria's uncle, went - to the
chapel, and when he found his niece, in her
rich marriage costume, laying all pale and
cold upon the marble, he uttered frightful
imprecations on herhead. Three daysafter,
he carried her away from Coimbra,and placed
her into some convent. I heard this after-
wards, as well as, that the severest penances
were laid upon the poor Donna. God help
her, she was beautiful and good 1" and the
gipsy concluded his story with a grave bow.
Many of the gipsy women had sunk to
sleep during the recital of the tale. And
the rest now composed themselves to enjoy
a short nap on their grassy beds. But from
above the gipsy encampment,,from the mouthy
of the cavern, the night wind bore away thPe
sound of sobs and sighs; and bitter fees
watered the little flowers that waved Afrom
the edge of the hight.
The face of nature blushedwiththe scarlet
of morning. All over the bounding sea and
the quiet verdant-hills, over the villages, the
fields and the silent green woods, the bright
red flush of morning was borne by the breeze.
And then solitary beams of light flashed
through the scarlet East, on;the sea and- the
hills, and disappeared again. At last .the
waves broke into a smile of joy, as a flood of
golden sunshine swept over them; and the
trees-shook their branches to the morning
wind; and the hills seemed so many fairy
queens in diamond robes, as every dewdrop
f blazed and flashed in the glorious light.
Small birds, thatgencrally greet the morn-

ment's consideration I took the letter, and
told" the Don that I, would do his bidding.
Without the slightest hesitation, I entered
Donna Gloria's house and pushing aside the
servants that opposed me, made my way in-I
to the festal hall, and, with a low:obeisance,4
delivered the thanks of the beggars to the
bridegroom, in a few extravagant sentences.
Thecompany laughed,and Don Menezes bade
me approach to receive-a golden donation in
return. This opportunity I waited, and
while receiving his money, dropped the note
into Donna Gloria's lap. She started,atfirst
seeing me, and covered the noteimmediately
with her hand. #Two minutes afterwards I
was with Don Diego.   -        '
-  "We sealed -the garden walls, and sat anx-
iously waiting for two hours,in a leafy arbor.
A rustle, and the bride appeared, and threw
herself into Don Diego's arms. She eloped
with him that night. They did not leave
the . city, but hastened to a small chapel in
the suburbs, where Don Diego had a priest
in readiness. The monk was to marry them
-and I to serve as witness. The ceremony had
just begun, when there was a great uproar
outside. The doors were thrown open 'and
the old Duke of Azambija, Don Diego's
father entered, accompanied by a corps of
followers-
"God I# thanked, that he has spared me
this disgrace I" cried the old duke, when he
saw that they were not yet married. "Don
Diego, you will immediately enter my car-
riage," commanded the enraged father, and
as ',the young man, pale as death, sank on
his knees, the duke-signed to his servants.-
They surrounded the Don, and in spite of
his struggles bore him to the . carriage. A

extending in place of them. A solitary ea-
ges' floated almost motionless, in the pure
bliteether towards the pale indistinct sum-
mit of Mount Cintra.
- Early in the morning a dustcovered gipsy
had arrived, and brought a scroll to Massor;
on the scroll wete the following words:
"The King will proceed by water to' Be-
lem; Hereturnson horseback atfive o'clock,
and crosses the chestnut grove adjoining the
royal park, on his way to the palace."
Masior .immediately communicated the
contents of-the scroll to Donna Gloria. Af-
ter considering,she said: "Then we will start
now, and when we reach Belem repose for a
little while in a hostelrie, or the house of a
friend."
Massor assented and, in a few minutes,the
horses were brought. Donna Gloria, still in
her monk's habit, was aided to mount, while
Massor lightly jumped on his prancing steed.
The sun stood in the west and was pre-
paring to set, bygathering purple and rosy
clouds, around him, when a gallant train of
cavaliers entered the chestnut grove that
bounded the western sideof the royal parks.
The road which wound its irregular and
serpentine line through this grove, was bor-
dered by clumps of trees, that, howeverwere
sometimes, supersededd by low straggling
bushes.
The train of cavaliers entered the chestnut
grove. In advance, mounted on a coal black
steed of great grace and activity, rode Juan
the Third, King of Portugal. He was then
in his twentieth year, and but slightly tinged
with that sombre religious enthusiasm, the
effects of which, afterward corroded hismind
and weakened his body. . His forehead was
not high, but very broadand smooth; his
nose straight and small with expanded nos.
triue; his eye darkly and softly brown, with
bushy eyebrows; and his mouth small and,
beautiful. He had black hair; and a clear
lark'complexion:, a black beard,of the style
now called goatee, graced his chin,-and small
moustaches aurmounted his upper lip. Cov-

ered with a serious expression his face gen-
erally looked severe,,but when he smiled a
world:ofbeautylurked in; the brightened fee1.
, tures. A d-ressof blue velvet, and a cloak of
the same material fitted well, to his finely
shaped 'limbs, though the color did not suit
his style of face. From his 'cap waved a
magnifient scarlet plume.
Behind the King, yet nearenough to reply
to his questions rode hisfavorite courtier,
Don Alphonso da Costa, countof Almaveda.
He was handsome young man, with a fair
and brilliant complexion, bright blue eyes,
brown hair that fell in long curls to his shoul-
ders, and a happy expression over his face.
He wore, like the King, a small moustacbe,
but his chin was smooth. A dress. of blue
and white satin; and a black cloak like
those generally worn at that timeinPortugal,
made, up his attire.
The rest of the King's suite as they moved
in the sunlight glowed with every color, an4
sparkled with jewels.              '
The King had just turned an angle of the
road, when he suddenly checked his horse,
and with mingled feelings of astonishment
and perplexity depicted on his countenance
he exclaimed: "Santa madre de Dios!" :.
The suite immediately halted, but,.Don
Alphonso pressed forward, to see what had
so astonished the monarch.
CHAPTER         I1.
KING JUAN       THE   THIRD.
Ot a small patch of grassy ground stood
Donna Gloria, in her rich satin robes,
sparkling with jewels. Around her bloomed
a thousand bright colored flowers, and the
chestnut trees formed a dark back ground
to her figure.
The king surprised at thesight of a lady
of marvelous beauty in splendid attire and
quite alone in the chestnut grove, had halt-

When Don Alphonso had spurred for-
ward,. and seen   the lady, his surprise
equalled that of the king. Juan turned to
him, and inquired: "Who ean she bg"-
"I cah not imagine; but if your majesty
will command, I will, soon fAd out."-

"Go,'Don Alphonso;but inquire of her,
with all respect," Tejoined tlie king. He
waited impatiently, while the young noble-,
man dismounated, and leading his horse by
the bridle, approached thelady.
"Fair stranger,"' he began, doffing his
cap, "eur graeioti king would fain know the
nameof the beautiful lady that has so sud-
denly appeared before -him, and the business
which took-her to court."
' " Then, sir courtier, tell the king, that
but to him, will I disclose my name and
business," replied Donna Gloria, returning,
with a graceful wave of the hand the pro-
found salutation of Don Alphonso.
" But the king desires to know immediate-
ly," pa-sisted the courtier doubting whether
he should bear the bold reply of the lady
to his tnastee'.'
"You have heard my answer, sir, bear it
to the-king," *as the proud reply.
lDon Alphtbso returned, and reported to
hig ihipatient master the reply of the lady.
Juan, his 'edtiosity excited to the utmost,
rode forward' until he was opposite to the
ladiy, and then in the tone of gallantry,
then current at the Portuguese court, ad-
dressed her:
'"By our lady, beautiful dame, we can
not explain your sudden appearance all

one of the charming fairies Persian tales
speak of, and which, by 'your wondrous
beauty, ybu are well fitted to be."
"And like those fairies, I meet a good
and valiant prince, of whom  I ask as's-
tance," replied Gloria. '
"It is granted, by St. George; for who
could-refuse any thing to go beautiful a
lady ?"
"Youi majesty is renowned for gallantry
and fame does not belie you."
" It is easy to be gallant where the heart
feels love," rejoined Juan. "Ia what can I
be of service to you, lady ?"
- "My business Imust be conunicated to

beautiful wdinan, kneeling on the grass and
raisin her- white arms in the attitude of

The king, 'enchanted by the beauty, and
touched by the words of the unknown,'has.
tily dismounted, and raised hei from the,
ground.,
"I have given you my royal word, ldf"
he said, "and since you are a stranger in
Lisbon will you accept of' our hospitality,
and reside with our cousin the Couatess iof
Solani, in the  summer pavilion of the
palace ?"
"I will not refuse, your 'majesty's kitd-
ness," replied Donna Gloria.
" Thank you, fair lady I" exclaimed the
king, and gallantly kissed her whit' hand.
He then remounted, and dining o- the
suite, who with surprise haid listened to this
conversation,- but did not dare by the least
change of face to testify their feelings, the
king said:
"Gentlemen. we will proceed on our way;
you Don Alphouso and Don Duarte will
stay with our guest, until the carriage with
a duenna arrives which Don Carlos notifies
our cousin to send. On, then I" And the
king with a bow continued his way, while
the lords commissioned to bear the lady
company dismounted, and Don Carlos
spurred his horse across the wood, in the
direction of the summer pavilion.'  The
king's suite, as they passed7 Gloria bowed
low.
In a short time, a carriage drawn by two
fine horses rolled through the wood, and
stopped where Dohna Gloria stood. Al-
phonso opened the door for her, and Don
Duarte helped her to enter.
The carriage rolled away.
An old-lady, dressed in the hight of couft

In a dark gorge behind the last of these
mountains, sat two men on a rocky fragment
thatjutted from the mountain side' across a
black silent brook winding around the base.
The men were engaged in earnest conversa-

"It is a thing-of necessity," saidtheo elder,,
a tall and noble looking man of about' twen.

After trifling their pockets of all the gold

his teeth in impotent rage, and tried to break
thercords which bound him.,-   .-
"Is it not possible'that we might gain the
bandits to our- cause, brother? and they
would then kill Firma Vida and blood would
not soil our -hands." Enriquesaid this in-
quiringly.
"The work would still be ours, brother.-
I can not comprehend your subtle sophistry,
which would throw, the guilt on the tool and
free its employer.. Besides. no bandit would
attack a priest' replied Hernando,
"Brother," cried Enrique:in a voice trem-
bling with joy, "my hands are free. The
bands were tied so loosely that I could slip
,my hands out. Wait, and I will undo your
cords." He proceeded to free his. brother.
The room was very dark. . By touch they
examined its walls.
"Here stands a large chest, but it is
locked," whispered Hernando.
,"And here is another," replied Enrique;
"wait brother I will force it open."
,"You can not do it without tools,and the
robbers have.taken our swords and daggers,"
replied, the elder,                  .
"Come and help me, Hernando; perhaps
our united strength might force open the!
lid."
After several unsuccessful efforts, they at
last despaired and were about to give up the
task, when Hernoando was startled by a sud.
deg cry ofpain from his brother.'

"Great Heaven! what is it," he exclaimed,
as he turned to the spot from whence the
'sound. proeeded.'
, "'Tis nothing;" replied Enrique, "my foot
slipped and struck some subtance on the
ground."'
"2ee what it is."
"'Tis an axe !" lie cried in a joyful tone.
Hernando taking theaxefrom-his brother's
hand gave two or three stout blows on the
chest, but was interrupted 'by his brother
who exclaimed: "For heaven's sake, hold!
the noise will bring the robbers here."
Hernando,immediately-stopped and listen.
ed for some moments. The noise had not
attracted any attention. He now carefully
inserted the axe between the box' and lid;
using it as a lever, he forced open the lid in
a few moments.
The breaking of the look caused a crash
which, however, penetrated not beyond the
thick rocky walls of the cavern. "Bercau-
tious brother," said Enrique.
The chest was full of gold and jewels, in
the form of necklaces, bracelets and .similar
ornaments. This the brothers ascertained
by touch. Suddenly, Hernando cried: "1I
have found 'a dagger, and here is also a
sword I" and he drew from the chest the
aims; for amongst other articles of value the
banditti had jeweled arms too. Enriquecal-
so possessed himself of a sword.
"But," he said, "of what avail are arms
against a securely barred door I"
"True; too true !" After a few moments of
silence Hernando cried: "I have it come
brother," and they hastened to the door.-
It was barred on the outside by two'. strong
wooden planks, laid in massive iron holders
from the wall on one,. side to that on' the
other; thus completely crossing the door.-
Hernando' took the sword, and unsheathing
its thin, but strong blade, inserted it between
the door- and the wall. It was done with
perfect ease. He then pushed it up to where
the plank crossed the door, and tried to lift
the heavy bar. It was 'impossible.' The
bliAe turned in his hand, and would have

forgotten something, and he again ascended
the steps and entered the bandit's den.-
Enrique and the lady waited in almost un-
sufferable anxiety.
A few minutes elapsed and Hernando had
not returned. 'The night was still as death.
Thick drops of sweat\ rolled from Enrique's
brow and his heart stopped,with anxiety; a
few moments longer and Hernando was still
absent. The night wind rustled through the
willows. Enrique arose and began to re-as-
cend the slippery steps. The lurid light
that -shone from the-rocky entrance on the
black. brook was intercepted. It was Her
nando. A joyous glance-a sigh of relief-
gnd the brothers were seated in the skiff.
Hernando carried a bundle wrapped in his
silken scarf, and held a parcel, enclosed in
a cover of clotn of gold. After the bark had
floated, down the stream for some time, and
was distant enough from the cave, Hernan-
do used the oars, and Enrique steered to
the- opening in the willows, where they 'had
embarked. They landed and shoved. the
skiff into the stream. ,
The brothers now hastened to find the se-
cret place amongst the rocks, where they had
hidden theirhorses, before their capture.-
Fortunately they had escaped the notice of
the bandits. They mounted, Hernando ac-
comodating the lady with a-seat, since his
animal was the stronger.,
"Now,brother," said Hernando,"let us ride
slowly, and with great caution, around the
base of the mountain, to where the road en-
ters Moncorvo. Choose those places where
the shadow ip deepest, 4an1 the grasp softest;
for I am very much mistaken if many ban-
dits arenot around, and we need both co-
ver and silence for our safety."
Enrique nodded, and the brothers rode on.
The morning star flamed in the sky and
greyQbscurity began to veil the azure dark-
ness of.night&amp; s.
Suddenly, Enrique stopped and beckoned
$o biabrother. "Histi the sound of steps I"
he whispered.
It was the tread of men.
Hernando and Enrique retreated behind
one of several clumps of trees, that 'ringed

the foot, ofthe mountain, likean emerald
chain.
They were some bandits returning from
the depredations of the night and conversing
with each other. "We captured two.. fid
birds, last night," said one; "and call mea a
skulking coward, if they are not of conse-
quence."
"I hope we'll lift a heavy ransom then,"
said another. "I must buy me a newsword
knot, and golden cross for my sweet-heart''
"Golden birds can not come amisa to me,'
interposed another tall, burly fellow. 'I
think these two youngsters were especially
sent by heaven on my account;"' aed' he
piously turned up his eyes.
"Why, what makes thee think so, thoa big
bellied, wooden headed bully?" criedithe
first robber.
"Because I owe an account to'my father
confessor."
"And promised. to pay him from the neAt
ransom, I'll warrant,"
"'Tis true; and father Cyprian, shall get
his money."
"Why, thou dull-eyed fool, I never thought
the father would lend thee money; but if he
has, by the holy virgi's :rown, you'll pay
good interest;" and the robber laughed.
"'Tie not for money lent," resumed the
tall one, "but for sins forgiven. The father
has given me absolution at various-times,
for which I owe him money yet."
"Let us bear thy account; I have one to
settle with the father too," said another ban-
dit,
"I owe him for one farmer robbed, two
pistols, for two ladies eight pistoles and for
a fat citizen three pistoles."
The robbers had now 4rr' v opposite the

might be discovered.I
But not only were they coveredwith dark
shadow, but the bandits were sleepy aid
careless. Joking and singing, they passed
on.
At seven in the morning, the brothers ar-
rived at the gate of a stately house in Mon-

The side walls fronting the Higlistret' wore
adorned with small niches, inwhiehtood

But Hernando, at the bottom of his heart
cursed this fight, that took him away from

one whom he loved more than life.
-But there was no doubt, in both their
minds, but that iron necessity compelled
'their absence. "The discovery of,' their
journey to the North, the way they had ta-
ken, their presence in 'the Moncorvo moun-
tains, at the time of the murder, all could
easily be ascertained, and used to fasten the
eharg upon them. They had intended to
accomplish the deed themselves, had gained
possession of the priest's head and the em-

Wevill now turn to the bound and gag-
ged Margarita that was held securely on
the crupper of-the saddle by the guide, and
was an unwilling and unwelcome compan-
ion of 'the young men.
She had, by the scene in the hall, where
Fidaro so unceremoniously treated her, ex-
cited the flerdest jealousy in the heart of a
little dried up superannuated footman,who
went by the name of her lover. The foot.
man called Matto, vented his jealousy in
divers violent expletives; he swore by every
saint in the calendar, to drown'himself or
cut his throat. Matto's oaths and protesta-
tions made such impression on the tender
heart of Margarita, that the spinster, resol-
ved not to lose both strings of her bow,
conquered the rumblings and pains of her
throbbing abdomen, to sooth the indignant
lover. Nay she even went further, and
promised 'to meet him in the chestnut grove,

CHAPTER         IX.
?'H1E COUNCIL L BOA RD.
In a circular apartment, tapestried through-
out, with dark red damask, the council were
assembled. A table covered with the same
material which hung from the walls, occu-
pied the center of the apartment. Around
three sides of it sat, on chairs of a brightly
polished black wood, the members of the
council. On a gilded chair at the head of
the table, raised on a small platform, sat the
king. Don Antonio was-speaking:
"This document," s'd4 he, taking one
from the table, "signed by the chief justice
of Trazos, shows the deposition of the mayor
pf Moncorvo. Two young men arrived at
the city, two or three days previous to the
murder. They tarried at the house of Abra-
hamo Cenna and were seen,by the guard, to
ride from the North gate One afternoon.

The old priest murmured thus, all alone
in the reception room  Gloria had ordered
that he should be admitted immediately.
In the ante room, 'a orowdof courtiers
awaited the pleasure of the favorite. They
talked loudly and iherrily, and witty sayings,
on almost every high personage, flew about.
Suddenly they were silent, as Donna Glo-
ria, ' who had finished her ride, flushed and
heated with the morning's exercise entered.
All bowed low.
"What has brought Don Pedro from the
side of his young wife, this beautiful  orn-
ing," inquired Gloria, stopping before a
young and handsome man.
" To assure myself of your health,Donna."
"This is not, all ?"'
"I also easn2 to make a request."
"Letus hear it."
"My sister Maria wishes to become lady
of hopor to the dowager queen; could-"
"Itshall be attended to, Senor."
"My sister will thank you in person; and
allow me to send you, by her, a beautiful
diamond, which I selected for you."
Donna Gloria passed on.
She again stopped before a man on whom
sat an air of importance. His face was red
and blown up; his attire gay and in bad
taste.
" What gives us the pleasure to see you,
valiant captain? Itmust be a glorious thing,
to stand upon the deck of your ship and
look over the broad Tagus and the glittering
sea, this fine morning! Be on your guard,
captain, for I intend to surprise you, one of
these morzings, and to take the Santissima
Trinidad liy storm."'
"Take her, lady; and her captain to
boot I" cried the rough seaman, in undis.
guised admiration.
Donna Gloria was not displeased; she re-
plied, smilingly:
"I thauk you, captain; I shall remember
your affer, and perhaps one day remind you
of it." The lady paw pensive, during the

request you to speak a word for Juan Poi"

pectation of Gloria's reply.
"The matter shall be investigated," was
Gloria's reply, and' she signed to the page
following, to make a note of it on a'tablet of
ivory, which he carried.
Gloria passed on, and entered the 'recep-
tion room.
Seeing the priest, she exclaimed:
"Oh, father Marcus, I hope you have not
been long kept waiting I" -
The priest merely answered by a ow.
"But now," continued the lady'whose ani-I
mal spirits had been raised by themorning's
exercise; "now, you must share my pastt"
" Your!excellency willexcuse die, I hope,"
said the priest, seriously, "for I have broken
my fast already. Let us proceed to the bu-
siness for which I was summoned."
" Nay, uncourteous priest, you shall even
first sip with me, the delicious decoction of
Araby. Let us see whether it will put'you
in better humor."
Father Marcus gave vent to a grumbling
sound-half refusal, half unwilling assent.
Donna Gloria now sounded the steelen
rattle with an energy that brought several
pages at once to the apartment.
"Will you let me die of hunger!" she noi
costed them; " I am here,-with an appetite
like a famished beast, in instant danger of
starvation, and none attends with my break-
fast; bring a cup for father Marcius, too !"
In a few moments, one of the pages re-ap-
peased with a tray, on which were two small
cups of gold, half filled with a syrup-like de-
coction of the coffee bean, a silver plate in'
the shape of a large grape leaf, heaped wiih
delicate pastry, and a silver flagmn of wine,
flanked by high Bohemian glasses.
" Taste this drink, father, urged Gloria,
while she satisfied her appetite.

"I like not the decoctions' which, in imi-
tation of the luxurious Musselmen, we swal-
low, the materials from  which they are
made, are bought at heavy cost ip foreign
lands, while our home agriculture is not

"But, to meet you on your own ground,
father, does not the consumption of the coffee
bean and other Asiatic products give an im.
pulpe to the trade with the East; and how
much that trade has benefitted Portugal, I
need not say."
"Let us leave the business of setA te to his
majesty's ministers," said the priest.
"You are unbearable, this morning,"
cried Gloria. "This exceeds even your usu-
al moroseness."
Father Marcus munched a sugared star,

he was deep in the confidence of Juan. She,
therefore, said.
"Drink a glass of this fiery wine, raised int
our own land, on most Catholic mountains,
by most Catholic peasants, and then we will
proceed to business."
Father Marcus finished his glass of wine,
and Glorialeft the apartment for the docu-f
ments.
She returned presently, holding them in P
her hand, and signed the page to retire.
"Father," she addressed the private sec.
retary, "I submit to your scrutiny, 5ocu- fl
ments, that, for ought I know, may be of the
highest importance. They are written in a

"I desire no gold,' replied father Marcus.
"What then; explain yourself!"
"I must have a promise, upon the hoy

" Name it," cried the lady.
"I can not; f know notyet what I mpy

discretion, lady."
" But, it is impossible that I should prom-
ise to perform, what I know not whether it
in my power to do."
" Rely on me, lady," said the priest, ",I
will not ask too much."
'Gloria considered for a moment, and then
kissing a golden cross that hung from her
neck, said:
"I promise"
"Give me the papers, then."
The priest looked long at them, while
Gloria's eyes were bent upon him in expec-
tation.
"I know not the cipher," he said at last;
"but let me take the papers, and by the aid
of the cipher-record of the royal secretaries,
will interpret them and copy them out in

"Very well," said Gloria; "but if you

"My life is in your excellency's hand."
"True; and I will have your heart's blood

"I have the honor to wish you a good-

he mused, " and while I retain my power

"You also love, Enrique! Then you

passionately, and all the more violently be-

and Hernando hesitated.
"Whom?"
"Donna Rosa Bananda 1"
"My bride" ejaculated, in a voice of
fearful agony, the thunderstruck Enrique.
" THY BIDMII !" retorted Hernando,
while all the blood of his body rushed to
his head, and swelled the knotted veins and
arteries of the brows, until they seemed an
angry net of cords. Both were silent for a
moment. Then Enrique without a trace of
the usual gentleness in his voice and mien,
said sternly:
"My bride. The maiden whom I love,
and whose heart has been given to me, in
return. She is affianced to me before high
Heaven, and shall be so before men ere
many days pass. Dare not to think of her,
brother!'"
Hernando turned pale as death, whilst
Enrique said this. All the blood which had
run to his head, streamed back to his heart.
This lasted but a moment, the agony and
suspense of which are indescribable: Then
all the wild anger, the imperious and fiery
nature of Hernando was capable of, arose
in his breast. Then was, swept from * his
mind, every thought but that a man, hsd
stepped between him, and the first object of
his passionate affection. Then vanished all
but the maddening knowledge that a man
had robbed him of the highest blessing of
life; of a heart, for whose possession he
would have sacrificed all and rejoiced. A
child of the South, with wild passions like
evil angels tugging at his heartstrings, with
resistless anger and mighty love conquering
and treading down reason, Hernando was
for the time mad.
He seized his brother at the girdle of his
tunic, and his strength increased tenfold
by passion, lifted him from the ground and
carried him to the small balcony. Holding
Enrique at arms' length, over the foaming
billows, that far, far below, lashed the foot

of the cliff, he howled in a voice, almost in-
articulate from passion:
"Will you give up Rosa to me ?"
" Never ! Consider, brother, that she loves
me I Hernando, you mean me no, harm I"
and Enrique tried  to grasp his brother's
shoulder, while the cold sweat of agony
and dread stood on his brow.
"I will dash you to pieces onthe cliff

" Brother I remember that one mother

"For God's sake, brother I"

Hernando hurled his brbtber down into the

And the sun looked from the lue sky,
and the waters blazed like bek  of gold

THE WRITING ON        THE DooR.
Sunday morning dawned on the city of Lis-
bon, and the first bells sent'their clear, ring.
ing notes to the ears of the pious, as a sum-
mons to rise, and not be too late at church,
when Pater Sylvester, the sacristan of the
cathedral, opened his eyes.
The first object that presented itself tohis
sleepy glanee, was a woman standing at his
bedside, with her tongue busily engaged
in discharging scolding terms at his devoted
head. She was about the middle age, fat,
but hard featured, and dressed in a flashy,
slattern style. The worthy sacristan made
several conciliatory motions with his head
and short flabby hands, at the same time
pronouncing a few Latin benedictions, (his
stock in trade,) to allay the wrath of the fe-
male scolder. But the dame was not to be
pacified so easily. Nothing would content
her, but that the drowsy priest should risa.

morning. Every where crosses, madonnas
and saints were repeated in themost various
forms, with the richest materials.
Now the organ lifted its mighty voice, and
in' waves of harmony coated through the
longnaisles. Mass was performed. The pa-
pal nuntius, Cardinal Georgio, in his mag-
nifient robes, led the service and preached
the sermon.
And with burning words, alluding to the
scrolls fastened to the churches, he inflamed
still inore the wrath of the populace. When
the serviee was concluded, and the high
dignitaries of the church had retired, the
congregation left the church to wait before
the doors for the sacristan.
As he issued forth, with the scroll in his
hand, to return home, they told him of their
determination-to bring the matter before the
4-king immediately. They wished him tb be
their spokesman, well convinced that his
learning and sanctity fitted him to be so.
With some reluctance, the worthy pater
allowed them to place himon the shoulders
of a couple of strong mechanics. Thus,
mounted in the midst of the still increasing
crowd, pater Sylvester was borne to the roy-
al palace.
The king entered into thespirit of the
multitude, and received the scroll brought
by pater Sylvester. Don Antonio, the min-
istir, appeared on the balcony and assured
the people, that his majesty would endeavor
by every means to discover the perpetrator
of this sacrilege. .  -        P      Id
For this purpose, Juan sent the same day
ten thousand gold pieces to Luke Giraldo,
one of the most prominent merchants of
Lisbon, to be paid to the man who would
discover or lead, to the discovery of the
writer.
Ris eminence the Cardinal Georgio, nun-
tius of the pope, added five thousand gold
pieces more, to those already deposited by
the king.
Public criers proclaimed in every street,
that Master Luke Giraldo had orders to pay
fifteen thousand gold pieces, to the man who
discovered the wretch that had dared to
write the words, and to affix the scrolls to
the door of the churches.       i

The king was'furious. Two sue acts,.as
the murder of Firma Fida and the writing
on the church doors, occurring within a
short time of each other, in bold defiance as
it were, of his authority, showed him that
there must exist in Portugal a power oppo-
sed either to the church or the government.
He consulted with Don Antonio. The min-
ister's opinion not only coincided with that
of the king, but he also assured Juan that
this power must be strong, very strong, thus
openly and boldly to defy the royal authori-
ty. Still there was no evidence of dissatis-
faction among the nobles, or among the
people. Who would conspire against the
king? None but the Prior de CastroI' And
who would conspire against the church?
none but the New Christians, that still were
Israelites in secret ! Then the, king and
his minister came to the conclusion that the
Inquisition would be the most effectual,
means to control both these powers, awl the
king ordered Dop Antonio to prepare a let-
ter for his signature, requesting his holiness
to appoint officers of the Inquisition in Por-
tugal. . Meanwhile every endeavor was
made to discover the guilty ones. Let us
see what the people said on the subject.
A knot of men were sitting in front of a
tavern, that looked upon the Tagus. - They
conversed upon the scrolls on the church
doors.
" It will go hard with him, who did this!"
said a sailor whose sunburnt sallowness of
skin showed that he had been in India.
"le will but get his deserts, and Lisbon

by little man.
"Have you ever seen it ?" inquired the
sailor.
" When quite a child; but since then I
have seen a man torn to pieces by wild
horses, which is also a spectacle not to be
despised."
" You should be in Spain then," cried a
meagre lantern jawed Spaniard, who re-
galed himself with bread and onions. "I

We turn to an assembly of Israelites tha
had been hastily convened in the basemen
room of the inn of St. Ignatius. Their
countenances were troubled; alarm and fea
-were evidentin the hasty questions and
short replies. Don Lionel Dian was absent.
An old noble of great learning presided.
The general question was: who had done
this ? Was it a secretIsraelite?
The general answer could be no'other
than, it was: for who else, in Lisbon be-
lieves not inChrist?
While the meeting was thus agitated and
swayed by fears and doubts, a young man
entered, and stepping up to the platform on
which the chairman was seated, requested
permission to address the assetably.  The
chairman raised his hand, all were silent.
When   the  young man -looked.,around,
with astonishment all present recognised in
'the pale haggard features, the sunken eyes,
the brow hung over with wild mottled hair,
and the bent form, the ere brilliant and
handsome Hernando da Costa!
" I have written upon the doors of the'
churches the words which so excite the -rage
of the people,and your alarm I 1 have,in the
face of Chistianity proclaimed the truth -of
our religion, and thrown into the teeth of an
idolatrous nation the false maxixAs they bow
to. I have done this, and am ready to die
for it. Be under no apprehensions,-breth-
-'ren in faith-I will deliver myself up to the
king's justice! for Hernando da Costa has
nothing left but death!"
At first the assembly had listened with an-
ger, for this dangerous and useless procla-
mation of Jewish principles had needlessly
re-awakened the old hate of the Portuguese
nation against the Israelites. But gradual.
ly a deep sentiment of pity prevailed.

o  The young man seemed to labor under
such a load of misery; his physical beauty
r was broken; his mind evidently distracted;
e and his actions. and demeanor wild. His
y dress was in the greatest disorder, and his
beautiful hair hung in tangled locks around
e his head.
e   "But my son," said the venerable chair-
o man," know ye not that, by this action, you
have excited the wild rage of a peoplethat
t may destroy us ? Will not the king be urged
t now to introduce the Inquisition? Can we
again intercept the messefiger? Will all

I like the simple priest ? Son ! you have done
very wrong. Still, even to ensure our ge-
eral safety we will-not deliver you up to the
officers of the king, nor permit that you
should voluntarily devote yourself to death."
"But what can we do to stop the mouths
of those, that now cry: 'ferret outthe secret
Israelitesl they have done this!" said a
stout middle aged' man, a merchant wl-o
trembled for his magazines" filled with rich
wares.
" What Will become of us, it the Inquisi-
tion be established," cried two men, in the
garb of inks:
Each ode b6gan to represent 'and bewail
the peculiar danger which Would threaten
him 'and his possessions, if it werd diseover-
ed that the pretended New Christians hd

the leading spirit, Don Lionel Dian was ab.
sent
After all had finished their descriptions of
a danger, of whose greatness they were con-
vinced befoi'ehand, their eyes fell again on
Hernando, and their thoughts reverted to
delivering "him  to the king as the only
chance of safety.
But the oldnoble who presided could not
b3ar this thought. He arose and said
'"Neve'let as be bead enough to throw a
fellow inan a'.nd brother into the jaws of
death, for what -we know to be no crihn, but
even act of vitue. Let us rather atteiapt

lead all to think, that an Englishman and
Protestant wrote the first. Thus we will
be saved."
No; one else had any other plan to offer
land, therefore, the proposition of the old no-
ble was adopted. Still it seemed to many
but a trivial measure to allay public wrath.
The materials for writing were brought, and
Hernando had to sit down and write upon
large sheets: ,
"1 am no Spaniard and no Portuguese,l
but-an Englishman; I am a stranger and so-
journer among you. But if you spend hun-
dreds of thousands you shall not learn my
name."     I
Hernando did all this in a listless manner,
like one who, as it were, had no spirit, no
mind' no will to move or act himself, and
was impelled and moved by others. With
the greatestastonishment all saw this change
in him, the reason of which none suspec-
ted.
Let us retrace our steps and follow him
from the moment when mad with love, rage
and despair, he threw his brother Ernrique
from the balcony of castle Salonga.
After, in a moment of wild madness, when
reason, reflection, and even consciousness
was absent, Hernando had committed frat-
ricide, the reaction of his feelings was as
sudden as it was violent. The fraction of a
moment after he had unclasped his hand
from his brother's girdle, he would have'
givenhis life and soul,-heaven and earth, to
have it once more in his power to undo the
horrible deed, to save Enrique. With the
quickness of thought all the better parts of
his being, fraternal affection, reason, and
kindness of heart returned to him, and like
the lightnings lash in a dark night,.served
only now to show his forlorn, lost and damn-
ed condition to his mind's eye.
And it is always thus. When the evil
spirit, offspring of our own untamed passions
and undicipliged mind, has darkened our
.,eyes, and led dsto steps beyondredemption,
has plunged us into the deep, deep abyss of
sin; from whose mire a whole lifetime of
excellence can not cleanse the soul, he takes
away the blindness, and with tenfold light
illuminesihe depth to which we have sunk,

AL SEonnT,

and the heights we can never hope to climb
again.
The terrible deed,and indirect consequence
of his love for Rosa, wiped away all the
brightness and fire of that love, and left it a
burning sore in the heart of Hernando. Let
not the reader understand that now he loved
Rosa less. Far from it.- But every thought
of that beauteous lady was' attended with
agonizing remorse, with terrible pain, and
with a dreadful conviction that his, 'oyna
doing now separated him more from her,
than when the bright form of Enrique stood
between them.
The excitement and consequent reactida
of his feelings, seemed to have prostrated
his mind and soul. He was in a kind-of
stupor most of the time, only broken here
and there by flashes of a transient wildness.
In oneof these intervals he fled from castle
Salonga to Lisbon. His family alarmed by
his looks, and behavior would send for a
physician. - But Hernando looked the doors
of his apartments and would admit none.
In another fit of wildness, he had written
that bold declaration, and affixed the scrolls
to the church doors.
We have seen that he freely offered to de-
liver himself up. Indeed he would have
considered it a blessing, to be allowed to
steep his heart in the water of teath. For
he was tired of life and the sore pain in his
breast. Yet death alone would not satisfy
him. With severe justice he wished to die
in the most painful way as a partial pun-
ishment for his crime, and to appease the
angry spiritof Enrique, which he imagined
to attend him constantly. To appease the
wrath of God, he intended to maintain his
creed and principles in the face of the world.
Thus, vain man, he tried to lay life which
was painful and burthensome to him, an ap-
peasing sacrifice at the altar of God, and the
tomb of his brotherI And thus it is with
all of us.
We know that justice is preferable to in-
justice. Every one feels intuitively what
is just and unjust, which from this point of
view.are but other names, for good and bad
and, therefore, whenever we have wronged
justice, we feel a criminal consciousess of

I

I-

OR, PLoTs AD

it, and then try to sooth ourselves, by bring.
ing a sacrifice to justice. Still even then our
selfishness -lets us sacrifice things, become
useless to us by the very injustice commit-
ted.
On the Monday following the day when
the scrolls had been found on the churches,
Lisbon vyas astonished by other scrolls
being attached to the same places, with the
words:
"I am no Spaniard or Portuguese; but a
stranger and sojourner among you. Yet if
you offer hundreds of thousands you shall

1ut the effect was different from what was
expected. The people, and the priests who
preached 'to them, said: "This is a trap to
mislead us. An Englishman and heretic,
although he believes in Luther, does not de.
ny Christ. None but a Jew could have
written those words, " and the inquiry was
diligently continued.

Father Marcus again waited on the Coun-
tems de Voga. She received him graciously,
and, when the servants had left the room,
inquired:
"Have you been able to read the docu-
ments ?"
"I have; if your excellency will wait but
till [ can take them from the pocket of my
gown, 1 will read to you, their contents."
"Be quick father, for I am very impatient.
Are their contents of interest to me ?",
'"I can not say how far they may interest
your excellency, " replied the priest, search-
ing and fumbling in his voluminous pockets.
"Now, God help you, if you have lost
them I" cried Gloria, giving way to her im
patience.
"Here they are, " replied father Marcus,
c]mly, producing the articles in question.
"Now read them," cried the countess,
leaning forward eagerly; and in her eager-
ness almost grasping the priest's arms.
Farther Marcus began.
Not to weary our readers with a tedious
tra-aslation of the documents, we will briefly
acquaint them with their substance.

COUNTEIPLOTS.                       4T
The firbt-was an agreement of the Duke di
Asambuja's to secure to the Prior di Castro
the adherence of the nobles of the council,and
'of the leaders of the Cortes, on his royal ex-
cellency, the Prior di Castro, being able to
prove, by well attested documents the mar-
riage of his mother, to his majesty Emanuel
the Great. Also to prove, by certificates of'
baptism, his birth to have*occurred before
that ofJuan IlI, the present occupant of the
throne.
The second document contained a promise
of Don Diego di Azambuja, to bring one
thousand men, of well trained troops, to
Lisbon, whenever a written command of his
excellency the Prior, countersigned by the
Duke di Azambuja, was sent to him.
The third was a sanction of the prior's
claims, by his eminence the Cardinal Geor-
gio.
The fourth was the plan of a new Con-
stitution.
"This document,". said father Marcusto
Gloria, "I will restore to his eminence;"
and he put the Cardinal's sanction againinto
his pocket.
Gloria was satisfied. Now, a glorious
view of revenge opened before her mind's
eye. Don Diego was her's! her's entirely!
what more could she wish to accomplish!
She had his life in her handI She could
crush himI and crush him she would. She
would break the pride which made her a
nunI She would revenge the years passed in
the convent! Her blood rushed to her
head, and scarcely could she command her-
self to listen, to what the priest said.
" Here !" and he showed her a small pa-
per, " here is a letter which I found amongst
the documents; it makes mention of a gen-
eral meeting to be held in two days. The
place of meeting, the required signs for ad-
mission, the disguises are all so described,
that, if you permit me, I will attend the
meeting myself, to convince my own eyes of
the truth of these statements. You, as a
friend of the present king, certainly wish to
explode this conspiracy, and punish the
traitors?"
"Certainly. And, priest, I will even ac-
company you there."

secretary.
"But consider, the impropriety I"
"1 will gothere!"
"Consider, the danger, lady I"

TILE CONSPIRATORS.
4, the appointed time the priest attended
Glori.6. He brought two gowns, such as the
inferior monks were used to.wear. To the
bosom of each was fastened a cross of white
cloth.. The.cowls, that were attached to the
upper part of the gowns, were large and
he vy,
This, then, is the disguise we must as-
s"e e?",asked Gloria.
"It is, lady; are you yet determined to.
go,?"
$I I never give up my purpose."
"Tu God's name, then."
Father MarpAs wore an uncommonly se-
rious depression, even for him, this evening.
Perhaps he repented of having projected
this dangerous errand..
"Be py chambermaid, for once, father,
and, help me on with this cassock I" cried
Gloria gaily. -
The priest did as he was bid. Gloria fas-
tened the cord around her waist, and drew
the ugly qowl over her head; none would
have recognised her. She seemed one of the
tall poor monks, that throng the streets of
Lisbon to beg, or collect money for charita-
ble purposes.,.I
The private secretary covered his simple,
but Ane black garb with the other monk's
habit. They were ready to go.        .
"Where is the place of meeting ?" inquir-
ed Gloria, as she east a last glance. into the
mirror, and smiled at the complete meta-
morphosis of her figure.
"In a private chapel, hard by," replied
father Marcus.
"Let us go then," replied Gloria, opening

a secret door which by a winding staircase,
led to the rear of the pavilion. , : .
"One thing I must communicate to your
ladyship, ere we start," said the priest has-
Gloria turned.
"The sign on entering is to raisetlehand,
with all the fingers closed, but the first and,
the last. A watchword was also alluded to,
but not mentioned. If a watchword is ne-
cessary we will have to listen, for what those
preceding us pronounce."
"Very well," replied the lady, and both
were about to descend by the secret stair-
case, when an opposite door opened, sad
Maria Flunoz, entered, Seeing the two
priests, she said in great astonishmePt. ,"'I
thought rsy lady were here I" The.apart,
ment ,hey were in, was the last but one of
that suite.-.
Gloria knew that her chambermaid would
enter the next and last, to look for her. On
not finding her, she would be alarmed.-
Therefore, the lady said, in a voice as deep,
as possible:
" What have you to say to your mistress,
girl? I am going in to hea her confession,
and you must not disturb us."
" Nothing, holy father; but that the page,
Fidaro, has a message for her from,. Mas-
sor."'
Gloria entered the next apartment, saying:
"Wait a moment," and presently she re-
turned without her disguise.
"Father," she said to the priest, "enter,
for a few moments, this apartment," and she
pointed to the one she had just left.
" And you, Maria, bring the page bet'e."
In a few moments, Fidaro stood before the
Countess; the chambermaid retired. The
page threw burning looks-upon the beauti-
ful lady, and throwing himself upon one
knee seized her hand and seemed to devour
it, with a kiss.I
" Rise, Fidaro!l this is not seemly," cried
Gloria .slightly blushing, but smiling upon.
him with her velvetty eyes.
The page arose.
"What have you got for me, from Mas-

'' " This letter,lady; he is about to return to
the vicinity of Lisbon from the North."

Gloria tore the thread that tied the epistli
and inquired:
" Can Massor write? 't is a great accom
plishment for the gipsy chief!"     -
The letter contained these words:
"To morrow night, I will be with you
when the clock strikes twelve. I then -will

mises, and prefer a request. Be ready.

"Oh yes! my God, I have a great secret,
which I shall not dare to tell you," and the
page sighed deeply and cast imploring looks
at the Countess.'
"Secrets of the soul are best kept within
one's own heart, where they sing -beautiful
songs, and weave golden hopes. When they
are once let free, they leave us, and the torn
remains of golden hopes, the sad memories
of beautiful songs are all that remain."
" But one heart is too small to contain
this secret."
." Let us talk of other things," cried Glo-
ria, alarmed at the-turn the conversation had
taken: "let us talk of your message. To
whom is it?"
" To his excellency, the Prior di Castro,
and to Don Diego di Azambuja, my young
master-"
"What are you to say to them ?"
"I wm to give them these two letters," and
he showed to Gloria two epistles.
"Did Massor bid you do anything else?"
"To report to him all that passed at a cer-
tam meeting to be held this evening." ,
"Excellentl" cried Gloria. "Quicktell me
the password which is needed for admission;
for I am also going there."
"You!" cried the page.

e "And I in impatience; the password!"
"God and the rightful heir !"
-  " Thank you. Is nothing else necessaty
to gain entrance ?"
"One thing more, lady, and this will prove
an insurmountable obstacle to you.. The
, name of the person must be given, who en-
ters."
"The name of the person. Pshaw!" the

lady considered for a moment, and-thea said:
"Fidaro, do you know of any-one that will
remain absent ?"
"I know of none; and even if one stays
away, his friend will state the reason of his
absence and excuse it to the others."
"A bright thought! Fidaro,doyou assume
a monk's habit, when you go there?"
"Yes, lady. All there wear the gown and
cowl."
"Then let mego there in your place."
"Impossible, lady I" cried Fidaro.
" Nothing is impossible; give me the let-
ters, that I may deliver them there," said
Gloria.
"But if you should be discovered ?"
I will not be discovered. Hasten,Fidaro,
and give me the letters."
" Oh lady, do not go! Will faithfully re-
port to you every circumstance that happens
there; do not go !" cried Fidaro.
"I must go; that is enough. Give me the
letters."
Fidaro handed them to her.
" Is anything further necessary to be
said, on delivery of these letters ?"
" Nothing, but that Massor will be in Lis-
bon, tomorrow night, and see the Prior and
Don Diego himself."
"Very -well. Await my return here;"
andGloria re-assumed the monk's habit with
the white cross, called fatherMarcus, and
disappeared with him behind the doorof the
secret staircase; Fidazo was left alone.
They passed out of the pavilion. Donna
Gloria, ignorant of the streets of Lisbon,,al-
lowed herself to be guided by father Mar-
cus. While they were walking along a solii
tary lane in the rear of the park, she related
to the secretary, what Fidaro had told her
concerning the necessity of giving the name
to gain entrance.

held It out to him.
As he turned, his cowl was thrown back
partially, and Gloria could see his face.-

"You tremble, boy ?" asked Don Diego
in the old musical voice.

low tone.
"Be not frightened; stand behind me un-

-At Well, Fidaro, when did the gipsy chief

"Day before yesterday; I found'him near

.Gloria had placed herself, behind tse
young nobleman. That sigh! Like the loves
from the seafoam, so new hopes and joys
appeared from.the depth of Donna Gloria's
heart at that sigh. Was it breathed to the
memory of that early love ? Was it a tribute
to the recollection of her?
She stood behindDon Diego, and dream-
ed, and hoped, and hated, and trembled, and
gnashed her teeth, as various emotions rol-
led through her soul.- Men spoke, and ar-,
gued, and proposed,and accepted-she heard
nothing saw nothing but the form enveloped
in the dark -monk's habit, that sat before
her. And her dream was suddenly broken
in upon, by the obnelusion of the meeting,
and the departure of those present,.
We, however, who are perhaps interested
in the events of this meeting, will briefly re-
capitulate what passed there.
The Prior di Castro was greatly embar-
rassed. He had promised to exhibit the
proofs of his right to the nobles, that had
assembled, and but a short time ago dis-

AL SoRET,

covered that the casket containing those
proofs, had been stolen from his private
closet. He was, therefore, forced to prevari-
cate and satisfy the nobles with the word of
the duke di Azambuja who had seen those
proofs. The nobles were bid, meanwhile to
prepare and muster their followers, and,
gradually draw them to Lisbon.
Don Diego had promised to bring a thou-
sand men, to forward the scheme.
The gipsy chief had promised to bring
five hundred stout fellows, well armed, and
twenty thousand gold pieces.
The other nobles all named the number
of men, and the money they could furnish.
Each hesitated not to makeremarks about
the reward of their services,
His excellency, the Prior, promised to
take their request into consideration.,
The duke di Azambuja was to be prime
minister; Don Diego to be commander in
chief of the army. The gipsy chief had pre-
ferred, in his letter, a singular request.
" Religious liberty I" Moors, Roman Cath-
olics, Israelites, all he wished to be put upon
an equal level, in a social and legal point of
view. The assembly was paralysed with
astonishment. The Cardinal was the first to
declaim against this. Others followed. The
Prior was forced, to rise and promise to ac-
cept on those conditions nothing from Massor.
Another meeting was to be held a week
from that day in the same chapel, and
which was to be attended by many of the
Cortes.
Then  the conspirators adjourned and
dispersed. Don Diego arose and said to
Gloria:
" Follow me home;- I wish to put off this
disguise, and then we will proceed upon
another errand."
Gloria bowed, and followed Don Diego
into the palace di Azambuja.
"Lay aside your cowl, and wait for me
below," said Don Diego, entering his apart-
ments.
The embarrasing situation of Donna Glo-
ria increased every moment. The pages and
servants, that filled the palace of the proud
duke, looked half inquiringly, and half sus-
piciously at her.

-The door of Don Diego's- dressing roost
again opened, and his own servant, or as h4
now would be styled, valet de chambre
came out, and giving ablack mask toGloria
said:
"Go Fidaro; change your dress, and keel
this mask in your pouch; then await Doi
Diego, at the palace gate."
A dark-eyed youth that stood by, laughed
and whispered to Gloria, thinking that i
was his friend Fidaro:
"What mad adventure took Don Diego
outto night? Has he a desire for the hear
of some fair nun, that he assumes a monk's
garb ?"
"Silence," whispered Gloria; "come with
me-to my room, and help me take this cowl
off, for as you hear, he is going out again,
and I'must accompany him."
" You speak in such a strange manner
to night, Fidaro," observed the youth; "Ho,
there I give me a torch," he called to some
servants.
"No, no; " cried Gloria; "I can change
my dress in the dark."     -
And she drew the .youth's arm, through
her's. Thus she was led to Fidato's cham-
ber without discovery. Chance which had
favored her thus far, deserted her not now.
The room was dark, very dark.
" Hand me some of my clothes, while I

"Then go and get a light, but quickly,"

In a moment Gloria had ascertained

" For God's sake be quiet. I must hurry

" Very well, take it."
Donna Gloria not hearing to expose her

with bended head, stopped at the gate,where
she was presently joined by.Don Diego.  .

the hardened heaps' of' mud, that~arose at

lay upon the ground'beneath the shadows of
thehouses, in the listidas attitude of Italian
loafers. Some talked and argued. Others
stared dreatmingly at the-blue-sky. Some
seemed to wait with -curiosity for the
oeedrrence-of something within the palace,
or theiseuing of -some, one from the gates.
Othersiwith indolent' indifference, slumber-
ed. In short, idle people had come to see'
the great Catdinal Savelli, and his renowned
seeretary Domingo; a Jesuit. Both had but

bull, aidletters from" the' Emperor Charles
V. ::The papal bull established the Inquisi-
tion in Portugal, and appointed Cardihal Sa-
velli its head,'and legate of the Holy See.
Hiseminence 'had been summoned to the
council. For the matters to be discussed
there partook much of the 'eclesiastic. Peo.
ple had-not'yet' seen the Cardinal Savelli.
It was for .this reasn, And to receive the
blessing' of 'a holypriest just arrived from

that around his palace had assembled a Lis.

The sun shone as a Portugaese sun is -wont

the releetion of intense light like white hot

dome; far above the city.
The-gates of the palace were thrown
open  F'oim thd ample entry rode three
Jesuit priests, onsleek well fed mules, Then
followed six servants in black, riding in cou-
pINs. '
'Their countewances' looked severe- from
under the broad black band of their caps.
Next, two noblemen, whom' the king had
sent to meet and attend the Cardinal. Then
followed his Emineicae
Cardinal Savelli was a strong, tall man,
with, *-biosd bat athei lov brow, bulging
ont at-be temples. Piercing gray eyes, that
tould soften soas to look tenderly beautiful,

flashed from beneath the thick, well arched
eyebrows. His mouth was handsome, but,
with a very sensual: expression about the
thick muscles around it, and on the full,
proud chin.
He was dressed in a long scarlet robe,
confined by a broad scarf of the same color,,
around the lower part of his chest. A cross
of gold hung by a broad ribbon on his
breast.- His head was covered with a small
scull-cap, around the edge. of which, the
black hair curled.
Behind him, rode Father Domingo, th,
Jesuit,'upon a stout, rough black horse. He
was attired in dead black, and carried a
large cross of gold in his right hand. This
man was of herculean frame; his face seem-
ed originally to have possessed a noble and
handsome aspect, Nay, the features were
still handsome and noble, but a curious ex-
pression of ferocity and cunning seemed, as
it were1 forced upon them.
Then a considerable train followed the
Cardinal.
The crowd was now all alive with curious
eyes and gaping mouths. It is true, there
was nothing peculiarly attractive for them,
in the appearance or retinue of the Cardinali
But thefame of his sanctity, the knowledge.
that he was to organise the Inquisition, and
the honor with which the king received him,
eombinedto-give him a high position in the
eyes of Lisbon. Above all, there was some.
thing new about him and his ways,'which
attracted the people.
Every knee was bent as his Eminence
rode past. He replied to these salutations
by'spreading out his right hand and several
times pronouncing the blessing:
"Benedicite, mei filii I"
Arrived at the royalepalace, the Cardinal
dismounted. Aroyal official held his stir-
ruppand another received his bridle. Father
Domingo, also dismounting, held the golden
cross he bore, behind the Cardinal's head,
taking' care to keep equal steps with him.
A Brilliant throng of nobles'and household
officers. awaited him at the gates, while 'the
soldiers of the body guard, were ranged in
glittering lines to receive the Cardinal. He,

The council were assembled.. Their Emin-
ences, the Cardinals Savelli and Georgio, sat
to the right and left of the king. Above the
head of Savelli, the Jesuit held the golden
cross.
Another priest performed the same office
for Georgio. From the back of Juan's
throne, and above ,hs head, glittered a
crown.
"We are now assembled in council," said
Don Antonio to those present, "for the pur-
pese of investigating the act of attaching
certain scrolls, with sacrilegious writing to
the door of the churches of this city; also
to reconsider the mode of action in regard
to discovering the murderers of the priest
Firma Fida. Then lastly to invest his Emin-
ence, the Cardinal Savelli, with full powers
to organise the Inquisition."
"My authority is derived from his holi-
ness. I bear a papal bullI" cried Savelli, in
a deep proud voice.
The minister bowed.-
" We will invest your Eminence with
power to judge and execute in the kingdom
of Porlagal." - The king nodded approv-
ingly, He was jealous of his royal privi-
leges, however much devoted to the church.
"In regard to the 'sacrilegious writing, an
event las occurred, which will happily end
all inquiries. The perpetrator of the crime,
- propably tormented by conscience --has
delivered himself up to justice." There was
a movement of surprise amotig all but the
king, whose eyes merely gleamed with a
joyous dash.
"I considered it best to place him before
the council," said Don Antonio; "doth yourI
majesty desire to interrogate him?"
"No, do you inquire of .him concerning
the deed; let him be brought in quickly,"
said Juan.
Don Antonio gave a sign.
There was a bustle and movement with- I
out, and Don Hernando da Costa, eurroun f
dad by guards, was brought into the apart-E
meant.                                 - i

"So it mightwell seem to your majesty.
For favors have been heaped.upouhim and

tonio.
The duke di Azambuja murmured: "His
father was a baptized Jew*and the children
are unbelievers. But. give: me rather ten
thousand heretics than one Inqisitor Gene-
ral;" and he threw a look of hate uponithe
proud Savelli.
"So think I, my lord," said the .count di,
Almaveda, who leaned upon the back of the
duke's chair.
"So think all good men," rejoined the
duke. - "Still, there is but onetway to avoid
this, and that must soon be tried "-
"I know, whatyou mean I God and the
rightful heir."
"Silence I"
The prisoner looked 'up Every eye was
bent upon him. His own cheeks again were
covered with a bright flush; and his eyes
flashed with excitement, when he perceived
the presence he stood 'in Juan 'threw a,
glance, in, which surprise and anger were
mixed, upon the young man.
Hernando's cheeks were hollow; his eyes
had sunk far down beneath- his forehead,
and gleamed like wild ignq fatuts from
the depth of a marsh. His hair hanging
smoothly down,-made only the more evident
by its black color, the mottled, ghastly pate
complexion, which now disfigured. the young,
man.
His right hand was torn and covered with
clotted blood. For in the wildness of his
remorse, he had dashed the hand whieh had
committed fratricide, against walls and eorsA
ners, until the flesh was merely lacerated.
The young mai hadsuffered terrible tor-
ments. . He writhed underthe punishment
of the damned. He felt the fate of the aw
cursed.
Let theologian* believe and teach, that
heaven is ever so far above, and hell everso
far beneath us, the experience of life will
show, that there is a heaven and a hell with-
n the bosom of man. These are, as it werap
ooked and guarded by a goodand an evil
spirit. Do we resign ourselves to' the' in.


56              .         T-N a FATI
fiuence' of the evilspirit, we imagine still
that we 'preserve dominion over'him. We
think:him our slave, to beused and put away
as we chose. , But the evil spirit may then
be compared to the witches of German fairy
tales. When the slightest part of any one's
body, s a.lock of hair, or a scraping ot the
nail had.been given up to them,1 they had
power' to 'ride the man each night through
storms and -seas and deserts., In this way
they inflicted torments on the sufferers, until
they, had broken their strength, health,
beauty, mental faculties and religion. At
last the unhappy victim was released, either
by death 'or by a resignation of his soul to
the witch. And so when we have given up to
the spirit of evil the least part of our actions,
passions or feelings, -he has power over us,
and rides the soul and body either to death
or perdition.
Hernando had resigned his passions for
onceto evil influence, attired, as it was, in
the rosy.fires of love. And, since-then, day
and night, the evil spirit ,sat on his heart,
and spurred it through the bitter storm of
helpless remorse, the deep sea of irreparable
guilt, and the barren desert of hopeless des.
pair. This had broken his strength, beauty
and faculties. of mind.. This had spurred
him - not-to perdition - but perhaps to
death!
?Do you confess having written this scroll,
and affixedit to the Cathedral door !" inqui.
redthe minister.
"I do I" replied Hernando, in a firm voice,
looking boldly up.
A start of surprise shook the company at
this bold manner, in a criminal, whose con-
demnation was certain.
"Give us the reasons of this strangely
saerileglous act!"
Hernando was silent for a moment. Then
looking fell at theking said:
"What I belive to be true, I openly affir.

"Blasphemy I" cried both cardinals, rising
in great wrath.
"Choke that blaspheming dog with a
flaming firebrand I" added Savelli, almost
springing on Hernando.
The Jesuit that stood behind the-cardinal
did not move. Great drops of sweat rolled,
from his face and bands, and his eyes were
cast down.
Hernando relapsed into listless silence.
The noblemen looked at each other in
blank amazement. The count di Almaveda
sat with calm face, but with hands so con-
vulsively closed that the nails entered into,
the flesh.
The king bit his lip with but illy suppres.
sed wrath. He felt, as if he should like to
spring at the young man, and tear him to
pieces. Don Antonio was the most composed
of those present. For even the guards shot
looks of anger at the, unfortunate Hernando.
A moment this silence lasted.  W -
Then the Cardinal Savelli turned to the
king.
"Sire," he said, still flushed with wrath,
"if such men existin Portugal,the Inquisition
is indeed the only measure, which can avoid
the fall of the church and throne. The cur-
sed heretics of Germany and Switzerland,,
are saints compared with this youth. ,The
church is poor in tortures to punish sins
like his. Nevertheless, we sball do our duty.
The justice of the king must deliver him
into the hands of the Inquisition for, against
the church he has sinned most. This after.
noon, I shall, with the permission of your'
gracious majesty, organise a tribunal. To-
morrow, this heretic shall be submitted to
the question."
"The question ?" inquired the king. "Is
that necessary ?"
, "Assuredly Sire!" replied the cardinal.
"He doubtless has accomplices."
"If you think so, Cardinal, submit him to
the question I"

OR, PLOTS       AND
A cold thrill shot through the assembly,
at these words. The king's permission bad
been granted to employ the question, pro-
perly called, the torture. Hernando was led
out scarcely conscious ,of what had been
spoken. Torture or no torture-the greatest
torture was within his bosom, and no rack
could tear his limbs more than remorse had
torn his soul.
"I place the castle at your disposal, Car-
dinal;" said the king.
"It is not necessary, sire," replied Savelli
"I have already chosen the Convent of Santa
Cruz to be occupied in the service of the
holy Inquisition, until a proper palace can
he erected. The convent has strong prisons,
and deep vaults."
"Do as you please."
"Thanks to your majesty, the true cross
will reign undefiled in Portugal. A solemn
service, and mass shall be held this evening,
atthe royal chapel to celebrate the establish.
ment of the holy tribunal in this land."
"But aire," the duke di Azambuja ventu-
redto say, "will the nobles and Cortes accede
to this ?"
"Need I ought of their consent in the
establishment of this institution, my Lord of
Azambuja?" inquired the king, angrily.
The council was over. The cardinals
blessed the king. His Eminence, Cardinal
Georgio departed, not quite satisfied with
the mode of proceedings, for he was thrown
entirely in the shade by his brotherly col
league. Yet Savelli bore a papal bull, letters
from the emperor, and was charged by his
holiness to establish the Inquisition, while
Georgio had no such charge.
Savelli remained to give orders in regard
to Hernando's prison. H    gave lengthy
instructions to the officer,- ho was to take
hin to the convent of Santa 'ruz, and guard
him,there. He spent some tme in advising
the Dominican monks, who would visit the
prisoner, and exhort him to confess his ae-
complices. And, last, lie ordered the royal
headsman to be summoned. With this
official the Cardinal had a long conference.
The executioner gave an inventory of all the
racks and instruments of torture on hand.
Savelli selected such as suited his purpose,1
8

and ordered him to have them removed from
Ithe torture chamber in the castle, to the
-great audience hallof the convent, and there
kept in readiness. Finally, the executioner
was bid to ettend in his official garb, next
morning, at the convent.
The reader will have seen, that Savelli
was determined to introduce the Inquisition
in style, as the present day would call it.--
Don Antonio had given him an order placing
at his disposition everything he might re-
quire,for the execution of his project. Her-
nando was conducted to prison.
We look into a small dark vault. The
arches that formed the ceiling seemed ready
to break down with their own heavy weight.
From the keystones upon the walls and the
ceiling, grinned faces, that seemed to wear
a demoniac smile, as the light of the single
torch, which illumined the vault, rose and
fell. The shadows slept thickin the corners.
The floor was composed of large solid blocks
of stone. A table, hewed from the same ma-
terial, stood in the midst of thO vault. Up-
on an iron spike, that projected from the
stony slab of the table, stuck a smoky torch,
that cast a flickering light upon the scene.
Near the ceiling was a round aperture
through the thick walls. The diameter of
this air hole might have been about seven
inches.  But its dimensions were still di-
minished by a strong iron bar that divided
the air hole into halves. The external mouth
of this hole opened upon the pavement of a
chapel, which, again, by open windows,
communicated with the court yard of the
convent of Santa Cruz. The vaults, used
sometimes for penitential exercises and
punishments of transgressing monks, had
been appropriated by Cardinal Savelli; they
were now prisons of the Inquisition. In the
vault above described, Hernando was placed.
The smoky light leaped over his form, as he
lay stretched upon the straw that had been
heaped up in one corner. All waq silent,
very silent.
What different kinds of silence exist!-
There is the sweet quiet of the summer
noon, under green leaves, and a dreamy
sky, with flowers and bees, and velvetty
grass around you, all quiet, sweetly quiet.-

tion) nd worthily to continue that history,
were e aims of his life. His daughter was
his only child. She was once destined to
bear the honors of his house, perhaps, by a
noble alliance, to add nw titles and wealth
to it. So many proud hopes had the san-
guine father founded upon Miranda, when
he saw her grow up in beauty, and endowed
with a more than ordinary share of wisdom.
He had given her an education extraordi-
nary even for a princess, at that time. After
acquiring all the accomplishments usual to
ladies of Portugal, she was sent in the train
of the present queen dowager to the lively
and brilliant court of Spain. Miranda had
also visited the voluptuous and vicious court
of Francis I, and finally returned to ?ortu-
gal-a lady of the court, with beauty, ac-
complishments and worldly wisdom-but
without the least particle of virtue, piety, and
nobleness.
I Don Nuna was dizzy with looking at his
misfortune. He could not believe it, that
the fair creature now sitting at his side, and
smiling so calmly, had dishonored his house,
and was in fact a thing the world scorns and
scoffs at.
When he had partially recovered, Don
Nuna inquired in a broken voice:
" But, Donna, if no husband will be found
to cover your shame?"
"Then a convent will! The family of
Perez shall not be dishonored by me ! I am
too proud of my name to make itea scoff and
by word to the rabble !" replied Miranda,
taking up a magnificent fan of ostrich
feathers.
" But whom do you propose to marry ?"
inquired again the old noble.
1 "Why," replied the lady, "there is my
cousin.'
" The governor of the East India sta-
tions?"
"CorrectI he is expected to return to-
morrow."
" Will he marry you?"
"Do you doubt it?" and the lady threw a
look into a splendid mirror at the foot of her
bed..

" Miranda, Miranda! I can not believe

" But Don Nuna, Iassure you that hoth-
ing can be more true, than that I have a
lover, whose embrace have unfortunately
made me a mother. This unfortunate cir-
cumstance forces me either to marty soon,
or to enter a convent.  I have decided for
the first," and Miranda arranged her snowy
robe in graceful folds.
The old man was again composed.

sake of the name you bear. But remember,"
he added fiercely, " if you are not married,

Don Nuna made a grave bow, and left the
apartment.
"After all not so bad I" murmured Mi-
randa, "I shall marry my cousin, and con-
tinue to keep my lovers. How disagreeable
that my father should disturb us! He might
have retired discreetly, when he saw Don
Diego. But these Portuguese have such ex-
alted notions of morality. So much behind
the times."
A half an hour afterwards the noble lady
had retired to her couch to sleep sweetly,
and dream of past and future pleasures.
Her father returned to his apartment and
sat down, with his brain frozen to ice, his
heart heavy as lead, his blood turned to
water, and his muscles rigid. There he sat
throughout the long dreary nightmotionless.
The morning mounted the skies, and the
golden beams of the sun fell upon the old
man.- Oh! how sadly had the events of one
night changed himI His proud head was
bowed, his florid face pqle as ashes; his
dark and lively eyes, sunken and surrounded
by tinges of rusty red; his dignified mien
had given away to a desponding, heartbrdken
look of despair.
Don Diego walked rapidly' through the
streets, lost in thought. He had reached the
palace di Azambuja before he remarked that
he was alone.-.

"The page may have'gone somewhere,"
he mused, and dismissing the eireumstance
from his mind, enteredthe palace,andsought
his bed.
Don Diego had loved too much, and too
easily to grieve deeply about the discovery
of his amour with Miranda. Especially since
he saw how calmly the young lady bore it.
Donna Gloria had separated from Diego
a few steps ' from the palace di Azambuja,
and retreating into a doorway, waited until
the young noble had disappeared beneath
the stately doorway. Then she continued to
walk along the street, unconscious of where
it led to. For Gloria was so ignorant of the
streets of Lisbon, that it was impossible for
her to return to the palace without a guide.
But where could a guide be found? Gloria
was perplexed. She looked     and down.
All empty, not being to bseen upon the
streets.(
Sheb thought erself of the river, which
passed by the pa ace. So she turned down
the street and descended the declivity, until
she arrived at the water. Along the river
were at that time some of the vilest, lowest
inns, where sailors and negroes rioted in dirt
and filthy wine. From the windows and
doors of these inns, light shone out upon the
street. Noise and sounds of quarrelling re.
souded through the night. Men drunk
lay sleepingin the soft mud. Others growled
andeursed, as they tottered around. Anon
angry voices were loud in altercation, and
theerash of falling tables and chairs, bespoke
scenes of violence. Gloria, the highborn
lady, who was used to silk, and gems, and
gilding and marble, to scenes of beauty and
words of wit and elegance, was thus sudden-
ly thrown into the vilest part of a great city.
Some drunken sailors had perceived her and
staggered towards the trembling lady.
"Well youngster," cried one, "do you not
long for the merry life of a sailor ?"
"1He says he wants to serve under me,"
growled a boatswain, taking hold of Gloria's
arm.
"Let me proceed on my way," begged the
lady, earnestly shaking off the boatswain's
grasp.
"What a tender voice," laughed another

sailor; "take off your mask, my merry boy,"
and he endeavored to tear it from the lady's
face.
Wild with fear Gloria tore away, leaving
the mask in his hands. Away she ran,down
the street with the rapidity of the frighted
hare. Behind her sounded the shouts of the
sailors. She saw nothing, heard nothing,
but ran on with all her strength; suddenly
she ran against some one, and with such
suddenness and force that the shock threw
her upon the ground. There she lay gas-
ping for breath.
The man she had run against,kindly bent
over her and inquired:
"Are you hurt boy?"
"No," replied Gloria.
The man assisted her to rise, and then
turning the light of the dark lantern he car-
ried, full upon her face exclaimed:
" The Countess di Voga!"
The light had also fallen upon his features,
and Donna Gloria in her turn recognised,
Pater Marcus.'
" Conduct me home, father, if you please,'
said Gloria and took the Pater's hand.
Father Marcus conducted her to the sum-
mer pavilion in silence.

Taking up his lantern, father Domingo
left the vault, followed by Hernando. The

were the doubts, hopes and fears that agita-

They proceeded about twenty paces along
a low vaulted passage, and stopped before a
door of iron,.like that of the cell, which they
had just left. The priest unlocked it.
Disturbed by the noise, the prisoner leap-
ed up and cried:
"Who are ye ? what do you want?"
Hernando gave a cry, a moan of joy, and

ers arm in arm followed his steps. He led
them to one end of the passage, and there
touching a spring, turned a large stone
aside from its position. Through the dark
opening, the Jesuit followed by the brothers
crept, and stood in a damp, low, apartment
of circular form. Around the walls were
small niches, with heavy pillars between
them. In each of the niches, was the Agure
of a coffin in raised stones.
" Formerly, nuns occupied this convent.
In these niches, those who broke the vows
of celibacy were immured. They died of
hunger and want of air," said their guide
to the brothers. Both shuddered.
" How terrible is the vengeance of the
Church," whispered Enrique.
Meanwhile the Jesuit proceeded to one of
the niches, and opened a small door that
seemed to lead into one of the pillars. The
. pillar was hollow and contained the landing
place of a flight of steps. They closed the
. door again, and ascended the steps.
"Now hasten," said Domingo, still walk-

The brothers kept behind him. They as.

harbor, all concealed and surrounded by
rocks. Hernando and Enrique mounted the
deck, and were kindly received by Mynheer
Sporaso, the captain.
He immediately explained that he was a
Spanish Israelite escaped to Holland. He
had formerly been in the Spanish navy, and
a companion of Captain da Costa the father
of Hernando and Enrique.
He now continued his old trade of seafa-
ring in the merchant service of Holland. For
the sake of the father, he received the young
men in a very affectionate manner. They
entered the cabin to enjoy some rest after
the exhausting events of the night.
Enrique communicated, next morning, to
his brother, the manner of his escape from
death. We will acquaint the reader with it
in a few words.

in drawing him from the waves.-The young
man had fainted. The fisherman took him
to the town of Peniche, from whence after a
slight illness, which lasted several days, he
returned to Salonga. Hernando wasalready
away; Enrique fell now into a severe fever,
during which he was attended by the old
dame Margarita. When sufficiently recover-
ed, he returned to Lisbon, taking the old
dame along, to restore her to the countess
Solani. But before reaching the city he was
arrested, on suspicion of being an accom-
plice of his brother Hernando. Dame Mar.
garita Flunoz was also arrested, being found
in his company. Both were imprisoned in
vaults near Hernando's prison. What fur.

CHAPTER XVII.
THE KING AND THE FAVORITE.
When Gloria had entered her apartments,
Father Marcus inquired:
"Well lady, how happened it that I found,
you lost among the streets, attired in men's
clothes, and so long after the conspirators
had dispersed ?"
"1I will tell you, father," replied Gloria.
"For certain purposes, I found it advisable
to follow the duke di Azambuja into his pal-
ace. From thence, it was impossible for me
to escape again, without recognition, in the
monk's gown. 1, therefore, entered one of
the page's rooms and changed my habit, ma-
king use of his wardrobe."
"But without cowl, your face gould have
betrayed you! You deceive le, lady, I
think."
A flush mounted to Gloria's brow.
"You dare say this to my face !" she
cried; but then feeling how much she was
obliged to satisfy the priest to prevent pre-
mature disclosures, she added:
"Your suspicions are natural. But I
wore a mask Searching for my way along the
river, I was accosted by some rough sailors,,
who tore my mask away. ThenI led, and
happily met you."
" Met me with the force of a cannon -ball,"
said father Marcus.

"But found it an impossibility to prostrate
such a worthy pillar of the Church, as you
are?" cried Gloria, laughing. "Well what
have you seen at the meeting ?" she further
inquired.
"All," was the reply. "LadyI we must
acquaint the King with the existence of this
plot. Having promised secresy to you I can
not act without your permission. Best it
would be, for you to inform his majesty, and
then refer him to me for particulars," added
father Marcus.
"1I will do as you advise," replied Gloria,
"but not yet."
"If we delay, the information may come
too late."
" His majesty shall know all within three
days. Will this do?"
"PerfectlyI Good night, Countess."
"The priest retired, and Gloria entered
her sleeping apartment.
Fidaro had waited and waited, until late
at night. Still the Countes had not return-
ed. At last he fell asleep. When Glo-
ria entered the outer apartments, her'
conversation with the priest awakened him.
He listened and waited. Finally the priest
departed, and Fidaro, who expected to see
the lady enter, saw the door open. But it
was not the Countess, but a man, with his
hat drawn far over his brows, that stood be-
fore him.
The reader will recollect that Gloria was
disguised in male attire. But Fidaro knew
it not. Jealousy like a poisoned dagger pier.
ced his heart. With a cry of rage he sprang
at the man, and bore him to the earth.
" What brought you here ?" he inquired,
in a huskyovoice, full of wrath, holding his
dagger at Gloria's throat.
" Do you not know me,Fidaro ?" inquired
the countess.
In a Moment he had released her, lifted
her from the floor, and pressed her to his
heart. Unable to resist,Gloria resigned her-
self to hispassionate kisses. When a young
lover has once touched the lips of his be-
loved, he is in no kaste to leave off kis-
sing. Gloria found itatlastnecessary to say:
" Fidaro, leave meI what madness posses-
see you?"

Fidaro pressed her still closer to his bo.
som.
"Page, I command you to cease! Do you
hear me!"
Fidaro released her from his arms. There
is a fire in the embraces of youth, which,
to say, is contagious. We learn that the
embraces of Prometheus warmed a marble
statue to life and love. - The embraces of Fi-
daro at least caused a small feeling of pity
and liking for him in 'the heart of Gloria.'
" Fidaro," shesaid, " I have admitted you
to my confidence, and hope you will con-
duct yourself accAdingly. A gentleman
admitted to a lady's chamber, under these
circumstances, will conduct himself at night
and alone, in the same way as he would at
noon, when she is surrounded by servants."
" Oh! lady, be not offended! my passion
got the better of my reason."
" I am not offended. But what was done
in a moment of passion, must not be repea-
ted."
Fidaro's face fell. His .eyes rested sor-
rowfully upon the floor.
"1I have assumed these clothes in the pal-
ace di Azambuja, and accompanied Don
Diego to night, in your stead. The letters
are delivered. Go home now, and, return
tomorrow for these clothes."
The page was reluctant to leave.
" Go," and Gloria preceded him, an&amp;
opened the secret door.
Fidaro looked so desponding, that the
Countess smiled kindly upon him, and gave
him her hand to kiss as he went away.
When Fidaro had gone Gloria retired to
bed.
There was one person however, in the
summer pavilion, whose eyes closed not in
sleep that night. There was one whose bo-
som felt the pains of deceived love, inwhose.
heart jealousy covered affection with black
spots of decay.
It was Maria Flanos. With the curiosity
so natural to women, and to chambermaida
in particular, she had arisen from her bed,
when she heard the sounds of conversation
in her mistress' apartment, and listened out
side the door.

"My brother!", The reader may remark
that in the sixteenth century the prejudice
against bastards was much less strong thai
it is at the present time.
" Lady I be kind enough to explain the
particulars of all this," said the king.
Gloria obeyed. From the time of receiv
ing the casket to the events of the past night
all was made known to the king.
Juan sounded the rattle.
Pages appeared.
"Call Father Marcus, immediately; " com-
manded the king. The pages hastened to
summon him.
In a few moments the priest stood in the
presence of the king. He attested all that
Gloria had related. The papers were also
produced by Father Marcus, who had kept
them, and deciphered by him.
The king was satisfied; nay more lie was
glad; glad to find his suspicions' unjust;
glad to see that Gloria had, by her own
means, saved him from imminent dangers.
Glad to discover causes that enabled him
with justice to remove a conspiring brother,
and to put down treacherous nobles. The
king, therefore, glad and grateful, embraced
Donna Gloria with ardent expressions of
love.              '
But the lady was not yet satisfied. Arch-
ing her stately neck nhe met the king's em-
brace with a face of cold disdain, and turn-
ed to leave the apartment. Anxious to ob.
viate the impression his suspicions had made
on the Countess' mind, Juan took her hand,
and, by the most affectionate words only,
succeeded in somewhat allaying Gloria's
outraged feelings.
" Ask for a peace offering my beloved,"
said the king. "I swear upon this cross, to
grant you, any thing you ask !" and heI
touched a cross upon the table, with his
lips.
" Well, sire," replied Gloria considerably
pacified,1" I will retain the right to make a
request until a suitable opportunity occurs.I

"I have sworn," was the reply. "But,"|
added Juan, "could you not give me the eas-|

e ket in which those papers were contained?
His late majesty, my father, once mentioned
, a casket of steel, which in a secret drawer
e contains important documents  Perhaps it
is the same, you now possess!"-I
Gloria rose and said: "Your majesty shall
e see it," and left the apartment. Entering
her bed chamber, she turned to the closet
wherein she kept her valuables. At its side
, stood Massor, the gipsy chief, the steelen
casket in his hand. The door of the closet
was open. Its lock had been forced.
The gipsy chief quickly aporoached her.
"Lady," he said, "you have been prying
into mysteries; thank your stars that no'
harm is done, and that I have abandoned
those to whom you have acted as a spy. You
have destroyed a conspiracy and men, whom
it would now have been my province to des-
troy. Therefore, I forgive you. I came
merely to get this casket. But you will see
ime again, shortly. Good night."  The gip.
sy bowed, and disappeared through the
window ere Gloria could speak a word, or
even recover from her astonishment.
She returned to the king, and said:
"I can not find the casket, sire !"
"No matter, Donna," replied Juan.
Maria had listened to all this, indifferent.
ly, except to perceive that she had not been
able to harm Gloria. The Countess howev-
er, who could appreciate the pangs of disap-
pointed love, said kindly:
."Go, child, I forgive you. Go to your-
apartments." Maria went weeping.
The king had his attendants called, and
instantly sent two of them to summon Don
Antonio the minister and' Don Pedro diGar-
cia, the captain of the royal guards.
C H A P TE R -X VIII.
THE ARREST.
On the same evening, when the things rela-
ted in the previous chapter occurred, Don
Diego di Azambuja returned ratherlate from
a visit this bride.
He hed scarcely divested himself of his
hat and sword, and laid down upon a couch,
when Amaso one of the duke's pages, and
Carlo, the young man who had taken Gloria
to Fidaro's chamber, entered. Perplexity

was upon their face. Amaso carried in his
*rms, the rich dresses which Gloria hadI
thinown off, and the monk's habit.
"What do you want? What is this ?'
inquired Don Diego, in a petulant voice,
wearily turning toward them.
"A very curious thing, and it please you,
sirl" replied Amaso.
"What is curious? speak out!"
"And it please you, my lord, I found a
suit of mine missing, and these female gar-
ments in its place."
"Let me alone; one of the maids borrow-
ed your clothes for a frolic, I suppose," re-
plied Diego.
"But, my lord, these are not the garments
of a servant maiden." '
Diego opened his eyes fully and looked at
them. The page was certainly right. The
garments were rich and must be those 'of a
lady of high standing. Let the reader re-
member that those were the times yet when
arich dress was asign of the wearer's nobili-
ty and wealth. In the present age the re-
verse seems applicable.
" And it please you sir, Carlo knows
something about this circumstance."
"What have you to say ?" inquired the
noble turning to Carlo.
"Why sir," replied Carlo, "when Fidaro
changed his dress last night to accompany
you, he would do it in the dark, and so put
on Amaso's suit. At the same time he
dropped a ring, which he left in- my hands.
On the whole, Fidaro behaved in a veryre.
narkable manner last night."
"Let me see the ring.D"1
Itwas given to Don Diego .
"This isvery costly," he said. "Did you
see," he cried at once springing up, "did
you see Fidaro's face, even once last night ?"
The page mused. At last he replied: "1I
did not, my lord I"      ,
"Neither did I; not a single time !" ex-
claimed Don Diego. "It is possible then,
that some one else has acq#mpanied me ?
he reasoned. 'By thegarinents left behind
this intruder may have been a lady, and
moreover a lady of standing. She may hav

mother of God, have mercy on us I"
And to his mind recurred every circum-
stance of the preceding . night. The meet-
in;, where this person was present. The
things that had passed there.
He now recollected the soft voice of the
page, the circumstance of his disappearance
ere they arrived at the palace, and a thou-
sand other little things, that, insignificant as
they were, now served to confirm Diego's
opinion that a spy, disguised as Fidaro, had
accompanied him. Regaining composure, he
cried:
"Call Fidaro, if he be found, and tell my
father I desire to see him."
The pages went on their errand. In a
few moments, that seemed hours to Don Die-
go, ao impatient was he, the Duke di Azam-
buja was with his son. Don Diego quickly
related to his parent, all he knew and feared.
The old noble grew pale, and his teeth be-
gan to chatter. He wanted tosay something,
but all his faculties were paralysed.
Fidaro was brought in by Amaso.
"You may retire," said Don Diego to
Carlo and Amaso; "but keep with some ser.
vitors within call. I may need you present-
ly.  The pages bowed and retired.
"Were you with mt last night ?" inquir-
ed Don Diego.
"I was my lord I" replied the page.'
"What clothes did you wear?"
"A suit of Amaso's and a black mask."
"Why did you take Amaso's clothes ?"
"They were the first I found."
"What did ou wear before you assumed
Amaso's suit?'
"A monk's gown, with a white cross."
"Where did you accompany me to?"
"To a house, where your highness met a
lady."
This had been communicated to Fidaro by
Gloria, when in the morning he returned for

said Miranda, gaily, giving him a rose from
her hair.
" How mean you ?" cried Don Isidore, his
forehead burning, and his eyes bright. '
Don Nuna di Perez put an end to the con-
versation, by his entrance. After a little
while he said:
" Come, Isidore; let us ride a little."
The soldier unwillingly assented, and
took leave of Miranda.
While they were riding in the cool even-
ing air, the East Indian, extravagantly ex-
pressed his undisguised admiration of Miran-
da, It was dark, and, therefore, impossible
for Don Isidore to perceive the deadly pale-
ness, which sank on his uncle's features at his
words. At last Don Nunamade an effort:
" If you admire her so much," he said,
"marry her! I am sure I would be content."
- Don Isidore stopped, and cried in a voice
of extreme joy:
"Is it possible, uncle ? Do you think I
can gain her affections ! Oh, if such happi-
ness were in store for me I"
At that moment they passed a house from
the windows of which, streams of light flowed.
The face of Isidore was bright, smiling and
pushed with joy. The features of Don Nu-
na pale and haggard. Could the heart of
these two men have been seen at the same
moment, still greater differences might have
been observed.
"f think that my daughter likes you,"
said the old man hoarsely; "she was an ar-
dent admirer of your deeds in East India."
What a forced slow voice to pronounce those
words!. But Isidore listened to the words
only. Besides, he had been away long, and
thought 't was age had changed his uncle's
voice.
" Thanks," he cried, "thanksI How hap-
py you have maade ne I"
Two days after, Isidore proposed,and was
accepted by his beautiful cousin.
CHAPTER XX.
THE NOBLE       AND    THE QUEEN.
An old ruined tower not far beyond
Belem, looking upon the wide mouth of the
bue Tagus, and upon the heaving sea be-
10

yond indicated the place,wvhere formerly an
extensive and strong fortress or castle stood.
It was a roughly built, and uncouth looking
edifice, and,although of vast dimensions and
great strength, had never been much useL
But now, the widowed queen of Emmanuel,
and sister of Charles the fifth, occasionally
resided there.
The 'night was murky. Great heaps of
clouds lay like vast pillows upon the sea,
and the winds tossed them about, like a
busy housewife airing her beds. As it
struck the sharp angles and walls of the
castle, the wind moaned and sighed, and
sometimes shrieked with a shrill unearthly
voice.
The dark figure of a man walked along the
solitary banks of the Tagus to an old ruin-
ed chapel, which, as it were, formed the
most extreme point of Belem, The chapel
belonged to the town yet. Around it was a
court yard, filled with rubbish, and loose
stones. Springing with a light foot over the
stones, and avoiding, as carefully as' the
small light would permit it,the heaps of rub-
bish and pools of accumulated waters, he
entered the ruined portal and walked
through the gray aisle of the little chapel.
Arrived at the back part, he stopped 'for a
moment, in a listening attitude, and then,
hearing nothing, bent down and cleared
away some stones. Thus an oblong slab of
granite was disclosed, which seemed the co-
ver to some ancient grave. Removing itthe
man uncovered the top of a coffin, set
into a grave of stone. A touch upon a
small iron nail that slightly projected from
the right side of the grave, opened by a
spring, the coffin lid, and disclosed a narrow
staircase. Closing again the lid, the man
walked quickly down the stairs. He must
have been acquainted with the localities, for
he walked in the dark. At the bottom of
the stairs a passage began, and along
this, he proceeded until brought to a halt by
a heavy iron door. Taking a key from his
pouch he opened it, and entered a room,
furnished luxuriously. Striking fire, he
lighted  two massive candelabras. Rich,
very rich, were the adornments and the fhrn
nitute of the apartment,

. The man threw off his hat-and cloak, and,
turning to a large mirror, surveyed himself
for some moments. He was of herculean
proportions, with calm majestic and dignified
features. It was Don Lionel Dian.
He seized a silken cord on one side of the
mirror, and pulled it.
The tingle of a bell was heard through the
sil  e,from far away.
i lene,-
In a few moments a door opposite to the
one through which Don Lionel had come,
opened, and the figure of a female entered.
She was wrapped in a robe of silk brocade,
embroidered with gold,and lined with snowy
white fur. In the corners of her robe were
the double eagle of Austria, and the lions of
Spain, embroidered in gold and seed pearls.
Her head was covered by a rich veil fastened
to the hair, by diamonds and rubies. It
was Eleanora of Austria, dowager queen of
Portugal.
The young and beautiful widow of Emman-
uel, entered with a hesitating, yet eager step.
Don Lionel threw himself upon his knees
and kissed her hand immediately.
"Thanks, Eleanora,.that you came. It is
so long since I have had the happiness! Oh
couldwe always remain together."
"Dear Lionel," replied the queen, "you
are selfish! You do not seem to think that
I have counted the hours of separation, as
well as you I"
Don Lionel had arisen, and silently looked
at the illustrious lady, but with looks of
suoh-burning love 'that they exceeded any
eloquence, his tongue might have produced.
"Let us fit down, Lionel,", continued El-
eanora.-
The noble pressed the beautiful queen to
bis bosom, and both sat down upon a Moor-
ish divan.
The reader may remark that, in royal
amours, whether of males or females, roy-
ality takes the initiative and courts the ob-
ject of its love. For,a subject dares not raise
his eyes,until majesty bends down. Don
Lionel hi, in his youth, been a page in
the household of queen Joanna, and later,
been attached to the suite of her daughters.
There, at the romantic court of Spain, and
the brilliant one of Netherlands and Bur-

L SECRET,
gundy, Eleanora first loved the beautiful and
dignified page, there the sentiments of a
deep, live-long passion first bloomed in the
heart of Don Lionel. From that timer but
one shared the rich heart and grand, noble
soul of this remarkable manwith the prince-
ly Eleanora-it was his nation. A secret
Israelite, half his being was devoted with
constant affection to his faith and the welfare
of his nation, the other half with a love
pure, holy and calm as the stars-to Elea-
nora.
The princess knew that he was a secret
Israelite. But, she also knew that he was
descended from the heroes of the olden
time, whose valor and splendor resounded
through the East, from David and Solomon.
She knew that he was of the lineage from
which the priests told her Christ and the
mother of God were descended. And hon-
oring his ancestry, the Catholic princess
forgot that he was of a heretic faith.
An Israelite in those days, was hated, but
not despised. For Spain's sweetest poets,
and bravest knights, and wisest statesmen
were the descendants of Israelites.
So it had come to pass, that the grand.
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella the
Catholic, loved Dop Lionel Dian, Vath a love
that overleaped the boundaries of religion
and station.
Don Lionel loved her in return, with an
affeetion worthy of its object,and of the heart
that gave it.
Yet he had seen her become the bride of
Emmanuel, without despairing, though not
without poignant sorrow. Because, from the
first, he had considered, that though he
might love a princess, he never could pos-
sess her. But Eleanora's heart was almost
rent. Yet the presence of Lionel, at the
Portuguese court, consoled her somewhat.
Still she hoped to be once-how or when,
she troubled herself not to find out-united
with the object of her affections. Woman's
hope never dies.''I                 .
Eleanora was beautiful. Her complexion
was pale and delicate; her eyes dark and
soft; and her features eminently pure and
regular. Upon them rested that proud, self-
possessed and coinmending expression which-

OR, PLOTS AND
we find to be an attribute of the scions of
noble and ancient families, especially of the
descendants of'royality.
Don Lionel gently put back the veil that
concealed the queen's face, and said:
"Some very important affairs have pre-
vented me from seeing-you for some time,
dearest; and now affairs of importance bring
Nae to you."
"Then it was not your ownheartLionel!"
reproachfully said Eleanora.
" When we are elevated above the general
mass, and the destiny of a people depends
on our actions, our own affections, however
strong and ardent, are forced into the back
ground, princess!"
'"Oh, but too true! The interest of Spain
wedded me to Emmanuel," replied the
queen.
" In the days, when we were young, and
the dowager queen of Portugal was but prin
cess of Austria, when Don Lionel Dian, the
leader of Israel, was but a page at the court
of Philip and Joana, when we both were
children, in the sunny groves of Castile,
then we could meet and part, as the heart
wished. But now   -"
"Our love is the same, nevertheless, and
will endure while life lasts! Not so Lio-
nel ?"
"While life lasts ! Embrace me again
Eleanora, and then let us talk of more im-
portant, though disagreeable matters."
The queen drew the handsome noble to
her heart, and covered his forehead with
kisses. His pale, noble face, all oversha-
dowed .with black curls, rested on her hea-
ving bosom. Both remained silent for some
minutes. The queen's eyes dwelled on herj
lover's face, his were upraised to her coun-I
tenance.I
"Then slowly raising himself, he said:j
"Eleanora, a messenger from your brother
.Charles is on the way hither."
"With what purpose ?"
"To prepare you for a new allianceI"
"Gracious heaven, again! are my feelings
never taken into consideration ? the Emper-c
or knows that I do not wish to marry again!"r
and the beautiful lady walked agitatedly up 1
and down the apartment.

COUNTERPLOTS.                       75
' My queen, my princess, my love I" cried
Don Lionel, "be calmI have not I, with a
composed countenance, heard that the king
of France wilk possess in future, her, whom
my soul loved from youth, whose image will
be enshrined in my heart when death hath
calmed it? Oh, Eleanora, were not my love
so great, so pure and spiritual, the dagger or
the poison would long have -silenced the
painful cries of this breast."
" You are, indeed, an example to me Lio.
nel," replied Eleanora. "But is it really
so, that I must wed the king of France ?"
'-So  the Emperor has decided.   The
fleur-de-lils will adorn that pure brow,whose
whiteness they can not match. The crown
of France will glow upon that dear head."
" And the thorns of that crown,-shall
pierce the heart beneath. Oh, to wed the
gay, volatile Francis, to mix with the plea-
sures of the French court, will be gall to
my soul."
"Francis is a proud and chivalric knight!''
"I hate him, already. Then his mother,
that bad Louise de Savoy, whose vices and
cunning are the by word of Europe! Oh
Lionel could we both die together now!"
" We both must live for future purposes
still. "
"But can not this be avoided? Francis
and my llrother are enemies I"
"It is to cement their new union and
peace, that this marriage is proposed.
"And I must be the victim."
"Dearest Eleanora, I will always remain
at your side. Let that console you I"
" Console me! Is not mine a fate like that
of Tantalus ? Is not happiness always within
my reach, and yet always eludes my grasp.
I shall not marry France. I will resist to
the last. Speak to me no more of it, Lio-
nel."
The noble was silent for a moment, then
rising, took the queen's hand, and with
graceful action led her back to the seat.
"There is something else, I wished to
speak to you of. The Prior di Castro is at
open war with the king. His adherents are
many. But they would melt away like love'
before jealousy, were Juan to abolish the
Inquisition. How much in mine and in my


76

THaE FATAL SEOlBT,

people's interest it is that the Inquisition be
abolished I need not tell you. Will not
Queen Eleanora, whose influence over the
king is so great, attempt to remove the hate-
ful tribunal ?"
" But, his holiness has sent the Cardinal
Savelli, and my brother has recommended
him in letters. Can Juan now abolish the
Inquisition without offending both the Holy
Father and the Emperor? Beside the aboli-
tion of the holy tribunal will only conciliate
the rebels, while its support will overpower
and crush them."
" To your first objections, Eleanora, let
me reply, that I doubt whether Savelli's
credentials, from the Pope, and your broth-
er are genuine."
"What I a Cardinal cheat, or even pre-
sent false credentials ? Impossible."
" So it might well seem. But I believe I
have reasons for this suspicion. You know
the Emperor's writing, as well as I do.
Look I" and Don Lionel drew a parchment,
heavy with seals from his pouch.
The queen looked at it.
"It does not look like my brother's sig-
nature, but may still be it," she said.'
"1I have no doubt that it is forged, but, in
a little time, will be certain about it. Mean-
while, Eleanora, while the Inquisition ex-
ists, I am in constant danger of my life."
" They dare not harm you. Should any
mischance occur, I, the Queen, the Emper-
or's sister, will step in and put a stop to the
proceedings. Fear not, Lionel."
"Oh, had I known that it would come to
this; that you would be the bride of Francis
at last, I would not have rejoiced at your
rejection of Juan. Fool that I was, to think
you would be left in peace, by the ambitious
Emperor."         .
"I am not the bride of the French king
yet. That hateful diadem, which is my
curse through life How happy could I
have been, had I not been born a prin-
cess. But being born so, I shall uphold the
pride of my rank and name," continued the
queen slowly; "Lionel, though I love you
more than all else, I would father die than
marry you I"
Don Lionel's face Bushed. "1This," he

said, "is the just feeling of your race and
nation. , myself, could never Wed you,
though you should leave the throne and the
Church. The pure blood of David can only
unite with a race equally ancient and no-
ble."
" Will you not," he continued, " use your
influence upon Joan, to suspend, at least,
the Inquisition for some time ?"
"Will I possess any influence on him
yet, when he hears of this French alliance '?"
Don Lionel Dian reflected for some mo-
ments, silently, on the position of things.
Then he said:
" The ambassador shall not arrive in three
weeks yet. This will give me time enough
to prove the documents of Savelli false."
"Do you still think they are-forged ?"
"Such is my belief; but 1 must be able to
prove it."
" Very well; I shall try my Uest to cause
the suspension of the Inquisition, for a short
time. This-I do merely for your sake, Lio.
nel."
" Thanks, beloved, thanks !" They em-
braced.
Thay still talked. and called up old memo-
ries 5of beautiful Castile, and of the happy
times, the pleasures, the joys, that had been
their's in that romantic land. Alas! Portu-
gal was not less fair than Castile, the Court
of Lisbon not poorer in pleasures but Lio-
nel and Eleanora were no longer young.
He was no longer the handsome, brilliant,
and imaginative page of eighteen; she no
longer the child-princess of twelve. The
poetry and romance that had occasioned
their attachment had fled, but the love itself
remained. Spring was    gone, and   the
flowers faded, but fall found the fruits ripe,
where blossoms had bloomed. Their love
had grown stronger, as youth, romance and
poetry fled. At first, it had been a love of
'he imagination-now it was a love of reason.
At first fancy had bound their souls, now
philosophy chained it. Still the heart burn-
ed with the same ardor yet, as when love
first lighted it. For their love was pure; the
fire was chaste as that of Vesta, and, there-
fore, everlasting.
Don Lionel Dian rose and bid the Queen

"

\

-OR, PLOTs AND
farewell. Again and again they embraced,
and could not part.
At last Eleanora wrapped her robe around
her, and leaving a corn-ear of gold, like
those she wore in her hair, in the hand of
Don Lionel, disappeared.
Don Lionel kissed the golden keepsake,
and put it into his bosom; then extinguish-
ing the lights, ho left this secret apartment,
and ascending to the chapel, replaced the
slab of stone, kicked some rubbish upon it,
and returned to Lisbon.
CHAPTER XXI.
TUBEGIPSY 's DEMAND.
We left Massor leaping through the window
of Gloria's chamber, with the casket in his
possession.
?Tis the evening after Don Lionel's inter.
view with Queen Eleanora of Portugal.
We enter a smallapartment in the western
wing of .the royal palace. Seated alone at
a table covered with documents, is Juan.
His plumed hat and jewelled sword are
thrown carelessly aside. The king is evi-
dently in deep meditation, for he does not
notice the small but beautifully proportion-
ed spaniel, that is violently tugging  at the
lace of his boot. He speaks:
" That my crown, aye, my very life should
thus have been endangered, and the minis-
ters of my council themselves among the
foremost of the conspirators-and that base
born-weed in the royal garden, the bastard
offspring of my father's illicit love, as usual
at the head. Holy MaryI defend us-and,by
my right hand, I swear to plant my foot upon
this Prior di Castro."
He rose, and in his excitement struck the
table with his clutched hand, to the evident
astonishment of the spaniel, which slunk si-
lently away at this signal of its master's
wrath. After nervously pacing the roomI
for a moment, Juan again resumed his seat
and continued:
"But, I have them in my power, and my
new born minister, the Inquisition, shall
destroy them, root and branch. The popeI
shall excommunicate them my army -"
A hand is laid upon his shoulder.
He grasps his sword, and, half drawing

it, turns and confronts the intruder, exclaim.
ing: "Wreteh! What hoI Guards I" His
angry glance falls upon a man of herculean
proportions, whose swarthy features and
motley dress denote him a gipsy.
It is Massor.
"King!I you cry in vain, I have long since
removed your guards," said the latter, in a
contemptuous tone.
"Who are you, that thus enters my cham-
ber?"
" Who am 1?" retorted Massor. "Like
thyself, I am a King !'
"A Gipsy chief t-A king?-Of cut-throats.
Who gave thee entrance ?"
- " Thou'lt learn, anon," significantly re-
plied the gipsy. "'T is, perhaps, for thy
own safety that I come."
4 Ha!I What mean you ? explain or I
summon my attendants to chastise thine inso-
lence."
"You may call and call again, still none
will obey your summons. For the present
at least, we are on an equality."
" Once for all, state thy object here, or
thou'lt be ejected."
"And art still not convinced? Dost think
that a Rommanni would trust himself in thy
palace  without sufficient  precautions?
HumphI King, you mistake my people."
The King without deigning an answer,
rang the call that lay upon the table.
The sound died away unanswered.
"It is indeed as you say. No matter.
What purpose brings thee here ?"
"Thy own safety, King."
"Speak definitely, fellow."
"I will. Thou hast introduced the In-
quisition."
"What of that," cried Juan, losing pa-
tience.
" All of that; it has been the cause of thy
brother the Prior di Castro's revolt."
" Aye and it will crush that revolt, too."
"'T is easier said, than done."
" The Cortes shall raise an army."
"They already waver; they will declare
for your brother, if-"
" If-.
"They but behold that which I h'ave to
show them."

' You ? Gipsy; and what have y'u that
eo influence the Cortes.1'
"These documents," replied Massor,draw-
Ing the casket from his pouch.,
By touching a spring, the bottom flew
open and disclosed some papers laying with-
in the cavity.,
"Give them to me," said the King.
"Excuse me, Senor, I can not trust you
with them."
In his rage the King bit his lip, so that
the blood came.
"What are they ?" he inquired in a voice
hollow with rage and mortification.
"The marriage testimonials of your father."
" They are in the hands of our chan-
aellors."
"You mistake. They establish the mar-
riage of the Duke di Braga with the lady di
Castro,
"Great Heavens I I do not understand."
"Then I will speak plainer. They establish
the marriage of your father with the Prior
di Castro's mother. They establish the P0or
di Castro's legitimacy and consequently his
claim to the crown of Portugal,"
The .King is paralyzed. Great beads of
sweat stand upon his brow. Anguish fur-
rows his features; his lips turn livid. Sud-
denly !an electric thrill shoots through his
body; his .eyes -dilate, and become white.
He suddenly bounded forward and,with the
fury of a madman, grasped at the documents
in Massor's hands. But the gipsy was not
unmindful of what was passing; his eye
had, at a single glance, detected Juan's ob
ject, and as the King thought to have the
papers already in his possession, the strong
arm of the Bohemian checked him in his
course, and forcing him with herculean pow-
er back into his seat, whispered:
"In a combat of strength, I would be in
the advantage, King ?"
The-King unnerved and exhausted did
not move, but remained pale and silently
seated.
-" In Heaven's name what do you wish ?"
At length gasped out the astonished Juan.
"I wish that, which you willfind it to
your advantage to grant I" answered the
gipsy.

"And what is that?".inquired Juan.,
"Hear me, King," continued Massor,"all.
these papers, all th evidence of your broth-
er's legitimacy, all and every proof conne-
ted with your father's marriage with the
lady di Castro--all, all, are yours, on certain
conditions."
" Hal say you so; name them, gipsy; any
thing you demand shall be granted; you
shall have honors showered upon you, gold
shall be yours, my treasury shall be at your
service, jewels,-
"Silence," interrupted  the Bohemian,
"and do you think that I came for gold ?-
No -Thank God, I am not what you take
mefor. Jewels-Honors--I know enough of
them,-what are they? dross, glittering
nothings, fit for such as you, and your fawn-
ing courtiers, who forget the past, who have
not the soul to meditate on futurity, who
live but for the present, and whose minds,do
not, will not, and can not comprehend, the
Almightiness of that one Being, to whom we
should bow the head in supplication. , And
the honors, empty baubles, bestowed by
Kings auch as you, upon subjects whomi
your people curse, upon those who can best
aid you in your tyrannical and oppressive
sway - these are not the things, I have
come here to obtain."
"You are not a gipsy," said the king.
"It is immaterial what I am," replied
Massor, "I have come here for a certaiai
purpose, determined to obtain it."
" But," said the King, rising, "let us again
start from the first point. You intend to
force some concession or promise from me,
by a threat to furnish my brother with the
proofs of his legitimacy?"
"It is: so, senor 1"
"1 will not conceal from you, that I have
heard of the existence of these proofs. But
should I refuse to believe in their genuine-
ness?1"
"Then terrible facts shall attest to it.-
The Cortes will depose you,thearmy of your
brother will be increased in an unpreceden-
ted manner, and the country will hail Anto-
nio di Castro as King! The nobles will
flock to him, and the Church crown and an-

"But you are here in my palace, and I
need but cry from this window, to call mul-
titudes to this apartment I can imprison
you and destroy the proofs."
"You deceive yourself, King. In the
first plate J will not let you approach this'
window; again, ere any one could reach this
part of the palace, I could murder you;
again these papers are not the genuine docu-
ments, but copies. You may look at them,
king," and Massor handed them to Juan.
The King was very pale, even greenish

"Take her back, " ordered the Cardinal.
The truth of Margarita's statement, as far
as could be, was ascertained, and the grey-
headed chambermaid was sent back to her
mistress.
It is a few days after the return of Dame
M rgarita to the summer pavilion.
She is in the garden with a group of ser
vants around.
Margarita is repeating something that calls
up agood many smiles fromthe younger part
of her audience.
"See this necklace of gold, worth at least
a hundred broad pieces; this is a present
from my lover! Ah I you may smile young
ones, but it will be long ere you get as rich a
lover as I have had. The day will come

"Enrique da Costa," she said loudly, "a

He had informed himself, partly by bri-

with Rosa's mother, who the lover of his be

" Don't be foolish, Margarita," said the
footman Matteo.
"Foolish? Is it you who are the greater
fool, or I?"  Then remembering her digpi-

added: "speak respectfully to your. superi-

The poor footman's heart was breaking.

"If you please, senor, yes!  He loves

"Well enough; for before he left Lisbon,
he abducted me, and took me along."

"But it is possible, senor!"
" What could a gay young noble want with

Voga, and, advised. and influenced by her,
despatched to the Duke this answer:
"The King, upon mature consideration,
has thought best not to arrest the course of
justice in this instance."
The Countess had also requested an order
for admittance to the prison of Don Diego,
whieh.the King, although unwillingly, and
with some hesitation, had granted.
Nevertheless, on leaving Donna Gloria,
hip majesty gave some orders about the exel
cutton, the purport of which we will hereafter
discover.
The evening of the day before that, on
which Don, Diego was to be executed, has'
arrived.
The sky was covered with intense black-
ness; purplish and yellow vapors, like those
of a conflagration, filled the air. Thretten-
ingly muttered the faint thunder, and a
dreadful calm, pressed like lead upon the
earth. The leaves of, trees hung unmoved,
and the waters of the Tagus and the sea
presented a concave surface, so heavy was
the compressed air. Not a flake of foam,
curled around, the cliffs, so quiet was the
sea.
A wall of livid blackness advanced rapid-
ly from the West, driving before it a long

along by the gale, and thrown down upon
habitations and houses, with tremendous
force. The air was filled with clouds of
minute spray, which, with the force of shot,
beat against and broke windows and light
structures. And, above all, was the deaf-
ening roar of the storm and the sea. '
The storms upon the Portuguese coasts
are terrific. The winds sweep across the
wide plain of the Atlantic ocean, the waves
drive unappeased across thousands of miles
of sea, and wind and waves spend their whole
agcumulated force in chafing against the
r ky bridle of Portugal. If lashed to fury,
the reader will understand the power with
which storms beat about that land.
Suddenly a hoarse and rumbling uoise
crept along the ground. The noise of
the storm had aroused mother Earth. She
shook and heaved in convulsive spasms.-
The Earth quaked. In a moment, towers
and steeples had - tumbled over. Whole
villages were lifted by the soil on which
they stood, and tossed into the river. Islands
were buried beneath the waves. Hills sank
and valleys became mountains. The storm
howled with tenfold fury.
Ships in the harbor were swallowed up.--
The wharves disappeared beneath masses
of foam. The sea ranged over the land, and
created lakes where mountains had been.
People prayed. Not a house in Lisbon,
in which the inhabitants were not congre-
gated in the cellars, and offered up prayers
and supplications. Fear and anguish stir-
red up every soul. Yet, in Liebon little harm

line of snow white foam. It broke upon the
cliffs. A sheet of blue fire rent th heav-
ens. A,deafening crash of thunder shook
the clouds. The storm had burst in all its
fury upon the Portuguese coast.
The seas broke loose. The waves lifted
up their voice, and roared to the hissing yell
of the wind. The beetling rocks were upheav.
ed, and tossed aloft upon the head of the bil-
lows. Again and again, crashes of thunder
and hissing lightnings tore across the sky.
The Tagus rose, and, with the fury of a sea,
swept away, the inns and houses that garn-
ished its banks. Uprooted trees were borne

was done. The villages upon the coast suf-
fered most.
Toward twelve o'clock at night the storm
subsided. The earthquake had but once
shaken the ground and was gone.
The air grew more quiet. The sea ceased
its efforts, Yet the water tossed in dread-
ful agitation still. The wind had whipi
up its lowest sands and shells, and cast them
upon the land, and it lashed wrathfully
against the shore, in efforts to regain them.
Then a window of the summer pavilion
was opened, and Gloria looked out. '
" The storm has subsided," she said, turn-
ing to MarialFlunoz. "We willgo now."
" For the Holy Saviour's sake, do not go.
out on this dreadful night," cried Maria.'-
" We will be crushed by falling chimneys
and rafters."

" No, senora, if you go, Maria will pecom-

"I hoped so; and now, Maria, since I
know not what may be the events of this
night, let me at any rate provide for your
future."
" Oh, Donna!"
"Here is a necklace of pearls worth a
small fortune. This will give you and Fi-

when you marry."
Marialhung her head.

Yes, he does," said Gloria.  Do not

Maria took the pearls and, with tears of
gratitude, kissed her mistress' hand.
This was the only explanation in regard
to Fidaro, that ever passed betweenthe lady
and her chambermaid.
"Now let us go, MariaI
" Forgive me, lady. But, oh, go to-mor-
row !"
"To-night it must be; order the chair to
be ready."
Maria went out and told the servants.-
Astonished at this freak of the Countess,
they looked at each other: But Maria, re-
peating the order,-it was quickly obeyed.
Gloria then descended from her apart-

ments., The Countess was wrapped in al
large robe of black color, lined throughout
with, fur. A heavy houd covered her head.
.A clumsy kind of litter, or ,sedan chair,
was held by four sable Africans. Six ser-
vants bearing torches surrounded it. The
sedan was covered with heavy gilding.
Gloria motioned an upper servant, who
was armed,to approach.
Bear me to the Castle !" she said.
He made a, silent obeisance, but his as-
tonished eyes expressed the wonder, he dare
not express audibly.
Gloria, followed by her chambermaid,
now entered the litter, and they were borne
rapidly away.
The wind extinguished the torches al-
most immediately, and the rain, beginningg
to pour, deluged the servants and litter
bearers. Great streams of water gushed
from the top and sides of the sedan, and
even leaked through, here and there.
At last they were before the Castle. The
servants hailed the sentinel, but it was long
ere their voices could be heard, above the
shrill and mighty whistle of the wind.
At last the soldier, who kept watch upon
the wall, heard them, and asked:
"Who is there ?"
"The Countess di Voga!"
"What does she want?"
The servants looked at Gloria,
"An express order. from his wrajesty, to
see Don Diego di Azambuja; " she said,
and the-servants repeated it, to the soldier.
There was some shouting and noise, and
at last the officer of the watch ascended the
wall.
The same questions were asked, and the
Same answers given.
"I will tell the governor," said the offi.
cer.
The governor was called.
He hadbeen prepared for Gloria's visit.by
a message, on the day previous, but had not
expected her so late.
The gates were opened and the train of
the Countess admitted intosthe courtyard.
The-, governor. inspected Gloria's order,
and then led her into his own apartments.
An, unusual.activity seemed to prevail in

the castle at this late hour. Lights stream..
ed from most of the windows, the soldiers
were all assembled in their barrack: rooms,
and the officers all awake and walking about
in the great hall, talking in whispers.
"Admit me to the prisoner, immediately,"
she said.
" As your excellency wishes," was the
reply.
And commanding two servants, they walk.
ed before them, bearing torches, toward the
prisons of the old Castle. Gloria, leaning on
the governor's arm, followed.
They came to the Western towers. Door
after door was unlocked by the obsequious
turnkey.           -
" Your excellency wishes to see Don Die.
go alone?" inquired the governor,
"Alone! " replied Gloria.
Another door was unlocked and they en-
tdred the chapel of the castle, which,by this'
way, communicated with the prisons, but
could also be entered from the courtyard
and great hall.
Both the latter entrances were now, how.
ever, securely closed.
"The prisoner is at his prayers," whisper.
ed the governor.
The chapel was quite dark, except, near
the altar, where foir torches shed a dim
light over a gigantic cross of brass, before
which two men kneeled. At their side, in
his clerical robes, stood Father Marcus
The governor signed to the priest. He
approached.
"This lady wishes to speak with Don Di-

Marcus turned a scrutinising eye upon
Gloria. She slightly lifted her hood.
He recognized her.
"Very well," said he. "But, lady, will
you not hear me for a moment now? I
have to ask you for something."
Now?"
"Yes, if you please. It will take but a'

The governor discreetly retired, with his
attendants.

vexed. "I owe you the granting of a favor.",

shining like those of an angry tigress. Her
breath came short.  A beautiful flake of
foam hung upon her fresh, scrlet lips. A
Goddess could not have ;been more beauti-
ful than she was, at that moment.
" Mercy !" cried the Duke, "mercy for

Gloria was exhausted. She replied not.

exercised their influence on her. And in

" For God's sake hasten, dear lady!"
cried the Duke.
"I go; Diego, I save you from death, that
you may become my husband. Farewell I'
One more embrace, in which both hearts
gushed with the recollections of the love of
golden youth, and Gloria, tearing herself
away, ran without assuming her eloak, to the
door.
The governor hastened to open. She was
conducted through halls and down stairca-
ses to the court.
This took considerable time, for the castle
was large.
When Gloria was about to enter her lit-
ter, the bell of the chapel began to ring
slowly.
"What means this bell, my lord ? " in-
quired the Countess, anxiously.
"1I am not at liberty to disclose it, mad-

"I command you! " Then softly entreat-
ing,   pray you, senor !"
The governor approached and whispered:
"The King wished to spare to a noble
family like that of Azambuja, the disgrace
of a public execution I"
" And, for God's sake, senor, proceed!"
almost screamed Gloria.
" And ordered Don Diego to be executed
during the night. This is the signal."
With a cry of extreme anxiety, Gloria
sank to the ground. But immediately she
rose again, and ran swiftly back into the cas-
tle. Up stairs, along passages, madly groan-
iig, she ran into the chapel; it was empty.
She heard voices; following their direc-
tion, she entered another room. Light beam-

a staircase of stone, that descended into a
great hall.
Gloria stood upon the upper landing of
the staircase. Below were a crowd of sol-
diers, a black scaffold in their midst,.a man
upon the scaffold. A sword flashed inthe air,
and with a dull noise fell Don Diego's head
upon the stone floor. Streams of blood del-

down upon the stone floor at the side of
Don Diego's head. The fall had fractured
her scull in various places. She was dead.
A dreadful silence reigned for a moment,only
broken by the gushing murmurof blood.
Then the Duke di Azambuja rose, threw
his arms aloft, and laughed wildly. The
events of the night had deranged his reason.
He was insane.
CHAPTER XXVI.
ROME.
"Romaruitlsuisviribus!"*  She has fallen,
but even in her grave, the memory of em'
pire hangs over her.
O 1 Queen, onthe seven hills, how beauti.
ful art thou ! They could tear the crown of
the world from thy brow, but they could not
rob thee of the splendid wreath which the
God of nature placed there. They could
take the purple from thy shoulders, but
could not banish the halo of art and poetry,
in which thou art wrapped. They could take
the sceptre from thy hand, but the fine arts
rule still in thee.
Three hills of the seven remain to Rome.
The rest are dedicated to the memory-are
the grave yard-of the World's Empress.-
Many pillars of shining marble still raise
their finely carved heads-but the roof they
supported has fallen ! Many massive fa.
cades still line the deserted streets-but
the houses they fronted, are dus6 Triumph-
al arches, and monuments of the heroes of
the Empire look upon the ruins of their lov-
ed city.
And the yellow Tiber flows on, the flowers
bloom and the trees green-what knows na-
ture of the changes that pass over the des-
tinies of men? And in the bright sunlight,
and the soft moonshine, the spiritof ancient
Rome wails amongst the gigantic ruins.
Hernando and Enrique walked in the
light of the setting sun, amongst these ruins.

ultation, Enrique with a quiet and saddened
flush upon his brow.
" There is the grave of our proud enemy;
of our destroyer 0' cried Hernando. " She
did not die in her strength, in her glory, de-
fended by heroes, mourned by prophets.-
But lived to be old, dishonored, scoffed, scorn-
ed, to be dragged through every quagmire
of disgrace, to suffer all and every pain en-
tailed by her sins and excesses. And her
mis-begotten offspring, red Popedom, dances
and laughs over her grave, dishonors her
bones, scatters her dust to the winds! "
" That is her reward! How dreadfully
she suffered ere she died, how well she was
punished, history tells.-That same history
which records our continued existence-a
type of our eternal life beyond the grave !"
"I cannot rejoice, upon these ruins, over
the fall of our enemy. The remnants are
grand and melancholy. Rome may have
been cruel, she was also great. Oh, how
beautiful! Come, my brother, ,step updn
this marble pedestal and look with me !"
"1 hate these ruins, with their beauty and
grandeur! From them went the order to
destroy Jerusalem. These pillars bore the
roof under which plans for our dispersion,
were concocted. I would pollute them and
grind them to dust, as I would throw dirt
upon the grave of a cruel foe."
Hernando, pressed by the heat, had ta-
ken off his hat, and as he stood there with
frowning brow, and wildly gleaming eyes,
his mouth compressed and head thrown back,
the scarlet light glowing upon his face and
black glossy hair, an angel of vengeance
seemed to have stepped from the earth and
apostrophised the marble ruins. Above him,
upon the pedestal, stood Enrique-beautiful.
ly pale, with soft, pious eyes raised to heav-
en, with light, sun-gilded hair hanging upon
his white throat, like an angel of peace
some from heaven. There could not be more
difference in the person of these two broth-.
ers, than in their character.
Hernando, seeing that he was unheeded'
by Enrique, also mounted the pedestal where-
on his brother stood, and in a softer mood
throwing his arm around Enrique's neck,
looked around.

The scene was superbly bright. Far in
the west, folds of scarlet and golden clouds
hung around the flaming sun.
The soft, richly tinted light 'flooded over
the dreamy Italian view, and pouring a
heavenly glory upon the marble palaces and
gilded steeples of proud Rome, fell with a
saddened glow upon the ruins beyond.
Wtth its battlements clearly defined
against the scarlet and azure air, stood the
castle of San Angelo. The marble statue of
agigantic angel, which surmounts it, seem-
ed just alighted from the clear sky above.-
St. Peter's lifted its dome, rich, fanciful, and
majestic to the clouds. No edifice, perhaps,'
impresses the beholder more with a feeling
of awe and devotion, than St. Peter's
church. There, architecture speaks in a lan-
guage of power, that fails not to be beard in
the heart.. Near it the splendid Vatican, on
every side, the thousand glorious churches
with Grecian pillars, Roman ornaments and
Gothic arches, with marble and gilded stee-
ples, pointing aloft; the basilicas with their.
odd vaults, the pillars, gigantic statues, and
the millions of objects that can not be grasp-
ed at once by the eye of man.
Behind, the remains of the old city, the
Coliseum, the temples, the theatres, the bous-
es, often with the broken pillars of the peri'
tyle still erect, with the arrow vesibula
still leading into the atrium, long no more,
with the defaced remains of the Lares, or
household gods, amongst the ruins, where
they were adored, and which they were de-
signed to protect. Oh how sadly fell the
light upon the latter.
This picture, which we have endeavored
to bring before the mind of the readers, as
it was before Enrique and Hernando's
eyes, was surrounded and varied with the
pearly foliage of Italian trees and woods.
The brothers were unspeakably softened
by the view. Rernando's face was serene,
until his eye lighted upon a dark spot near
the Tiber.
"Ah," he cried, frowning, "and amidst
"this beautiful view, a ghetto, a place of filth,
darkness and abomination is provided foi
the Jew! Look you there, my brother, and
see the drop of poison in this large cup o
beauty !" and he pointed to it.

L MaC RET,
Well it was for the brothers, that they
conversed in Portuguese. For, not far from
them, behind a ruin, sat an humble servant
of the church.
All at once, every church seemed to have
opened its mouth, and the thousand tongues,
of Rome, the sweet bells, poured the melody
of their voices upon the evening air.
"Come, brother," said Hernando, "we
are soon to have our private audience; let
us go home and prepare."
The two brothers went, arm in arm, from
the ruins into the city. They walked to the
palace of Monsignore Mezzani, who was
their host. The Cardinal Mezzani was him.
self an Israelite, and, therefore, best suited,
by his inclinations as -*ell as by the favor
he enjoyed with the Pope, to further the ob-
jects of the brothers.,s
"Prepare yourself," said the Cardinal, a
venerable old man with a long, black gown
and scull cap; "the Holy Father has inform'
ed me, that he will see you at dusk. Every
. moment you may expect a message." '
"Do you not accompany us, Father?"
"No, my sonI Have you the presents
ready ? They are of prime importance."
"We have," replied Hernando.
The brothers returned to their apartments,
to attire themselves properly.
They were soon notified that a papal at-
tendant had arrived.
Under his guidance they proceeded to the
Vatican.
First rode the papal officer. Upon his
velvet jerkin were the arms of the Holy See.

were forthwith led into the presence of the
Pope.
The Holy Father sat upon an elevated
chair, at the end of one of those apartments,
made immortal by the pencil of Italy's mas-
ter painters.
Clement VIII was an old man of com-
manding presence. The proud beauty, so-
peculiar to the princely house of Medici,
still lingered upon his features. But age
had softened that outline of almost sculptur-
ed exactness, had washed away the delicacy
of the proportions, and blanched the
haughty brow. A velvet scull-cap, lined
with fur, covered his head. He was clad in
a long, black tunic, with a broad scarf
around his waist. A cape, or a mantle of
velvet, lined with fur, was fastened in front,
and hung over his shoulders to the hips.-
The sleeves of his tunic were wide, and em-
broidered with lace.0
His dress was in many places ornamented
with crosses. Upon the high back of his
chair were carved, in wood and gilded, the
papal arms-the tiara and keys. They were
also embroidered upon the cushion serving
as a stool- Tassels of seed pearls adorned
that cushion at the corners.
Hernando and Enrique knelt, and kissed
the cross, which was embroidered upon the
slipper of his Holiness.
" Benedicite, meiflii," said his Holiness,
ima full, impressive voice.
" What is your errand to the Holy See?"
"We are humbly commissioned by the
New Christians of Portugal, to present these
monies to the treasury of the Church;" said
.Hernando, and with a slight backward mo.
tion of his hand, he pointed to the bags of
doubloons, which had been placed by the
bearers in the lower part of the hall.
"It is a payment for 'indulgencies, as we
have committed many sins."
*'We hope that you repent of them, mio
caro."
- Assuredly. Do St. Peterfind St. Paul par-
don the sins of us misguided mortals?"
"We will pray for you,and thus assure gra.
clam coeli, divine pardon. in nomine Patri,
flii et spi ritus sancti, I absolve ye, as repre.
sentatives of the New Christians, in Portu-
gal! ' May your sins be struck out from the

book of St. Peter and St. PaulI " and each
of the brothers kneeling, the Pontiff slightly
raised his hand, and said to each separately:
" Absolve teI"
The brothers bent low their heads; as the
redeeming words were pronounced by the
Head of the Church.
The Holy Father rose. Cardinal Mezzani
then motioned to the brothers who, with low
reverence, went backward out of the hall.-
A papal secretary was in waiting.   He
handed them the written absolution of the
Pontiff. It was signed by Clement and seal-
ed with the arms of theHoly See.
The brothers returned to the house of the
Cardinal and, having now executed their
mission, prepared to return.
Yet there was one more secret mission,
which they had been ordered to perform.
It was concerning the Cardinal Savelli.-
They had procured assurances from the
highest sources, that Savelli had never been
sent to Portugal, that he was no Cardinal,
that his documents were forged.
S'the fetters of Pater Domingo were deliv-
ered to the Cardinal, who returned to the
brothers the written assurance of his Holi-
ness, that Savelli was an impostor.
The brothers had also received epistles to
the Inquisitor General of Spain, in which
his spiritual superiors exhorted him to ar-
rest and condemn the mAn who forged a
Cardinal's title, and assumed an office not
given him by the Holy See.
The written assurance of the Pontiff was
couched in these words:
We hereby inform our well-beloved son,
Juan of Portugal, that the priest Savelli pose
sesses no authority from our hand to act, a
we have been informed he does.
CLEMENTT"
The other letters were more explicit, and
urged the peculiar crime of Savelli, and hia
speedy deposition and punishment.
Ere many days had passed, the brothers
were safely embarked on board of the same
Dutch vessel. The wind was fair,pnd the *
sunny shores of Italy vanished in the dis-
tance, concealed by a haze of azure e nd
gold.

"1I force ye not, to be his wife, but neither

"It is enough, my mother, thanks for this."
The ladies rose and walked along the
sombre, darkened paths, all over arched by
trembling foliage. Now, they reached the
house, and turning, looked upon the glowing
stars.  The whispering wind  did creep
around the trunks of aged trees, and whistle
through the knots. They went into the silent
house. Then from beneath the brownish
trunks that rose in bosquets, and in silent
clumps aloft around the arbor, where the
ladies sat, a figure stole. It was a man whose
face, all bitter with the wicked though ts
within, was lifted to the pure and starlit
sky. The moon, with trembling beams, did
gleam upon the figure and the face. But
burning bright with selfevolved rays the
eyes did shine, and shed a beam of hell upon
the face. 'T was Miguel di Sousa; he had
heard the trustful conversation of the child
and mother. He then knew well that ne'er,
with Donna -Bananda's word, he could ac-
complish his purpose. His heart was
pressed with grief, and from its secret
chamber flew the dormant poison. What
schemes and plans then sprang to life, the rea-
der will only see as executed by that revenge-
ful man, whose soul was bent on wedding
Rosa.
The morning after Rosa's confession to
her mother, Don Miguel di Sousa reclined
on the cushions of a two oared barge, which
was being rowed toward a large three mashed
vessel.  In letters of gold was painted
around the figurehead, the vessel's name,
"St. Pedro di Alvendi."

Don Miguel was put on board, and there
received by a thin weasel-faced man, who
was the captain.
" How are you, old friend.!" cried Don
Miguel, with a heartiness, which was re-
turned in part, by the weasel-faced one.
"Well, well! I am quite well, but wish
to be at sea again."
"Oh, Misardo, always wishing to lie
on the broad ocean."
" Yes; 't is too expensive to live on land.
My heart always burns, when they roar
land from the masthead. I do n't like it."
"My old water dog, I should think you
would like, once in a while, to see your.
relatives again."
"No, no, I have none! so help me St.
Pedro; none, but a few rascally starvelings,
who want to rob me of my well-earned
savings; not that I have much !"
Miguel replied by what is termed, at
the present time, "a wink," which said
plainer than words could express it:
"I know you, old miser."
"Nay, nay," again said Captain Misardo,
uneasily, " I possess nothing. But when
land is in sight, I know the next thing want-
ed will be pay for the sailors - the scamps."
"Well, they earn it, pretty hard."
"And spend it easy; a sailor throws
away more in day on shore, than their cap-
tain expends in a week."
" I dare say. Bet let us go into the cabin
where I will thank you for a draught from
your best. I have business with you," con
tinued the noble as they entered the cabin.
" Business," said old Misardo, stopping,
"I have no money, and can't lend any.-
People fancy me rich, but St. Pedro knows
that I am a beggar; a ruined beggar."
"Be not afraid. I do not want money."
Misardo drew a sigh of relief.
" What else then," said he, placing a
cup for his guest.
" Are you sure there is no listener near,"
said Miguel, looking around anxiously.
"No. Why you surprise me. What is
is you want with me ?
Miguel was silent for a few moments.
" What is it that you want?" inquired
Captain Misardo, growing pale.

"Do not be afraid. It is something con-
cerning myself, entirely."
"1OhI" sighed, the weasel faced one.-
"You know, Misardo, that it is I, who has
procured you the command of this vessel."
"Certainly, certainly. Much obliged to
you, always."

"Do not repeat your assurances to me.-

"True, I could lend you none. My purse

"A thousand curses on your headI re-

The attentive Misarado nodded, and said,
sotto voce:" Immensely rich!"
"It is arranged that I wed her in a month
from this time."
"If you need any money for the wedding,
I may be able to accommodate you," broke
in Misardo, "for I hold a certain sum in
trust for another. Always on condition of
good interest and secured on the lands of
Bananda."
"Will your rattling tongue never stop
clicking about money and money ? Quiet,
I say!"
The captain was silent.
"Well," continued Miguel, "as I said, all
is arranged. Now, at once, the girl refuses
to marry me."
"I don't think I can let you have any
money, for I hold it but in trust, and 't
would be unlawful to do business with it."
Miguel lifted up the glassen pitcher, that
stood upon the table of the cabin, and threw
it at Misardo's head. The weasel-faced one
dodged, and thus eluded the blow. The

" Calm down, my magnificent captain,
and let us continue. Let me see, where did
I stop ?",
"That I could not lend you any money."
Miguel looked about and would  rtainly
have thrown something else at Misardo,
had there been any convenient missile
within reach; as it was, he contented himself
with a furious glance, and then continued:'
" The girl does. not love me, she says;

that the intentions of the bride will prevent
the consummation of the nuptials. All

Miguel's features worked and writhed, while
thus relating his hopeless prospects.
"A great loss, a great loss!" murmured
Misardo. " She is immensely rich."
" And I am ruined, if I can nt get hold
of her fortune. My slight savings melted
away in England."
" Dreadful," said Misado, growing pale;
"I am not able to aid you, for I am poor.

Another furious glance at Misardo.
"No, no; I must marry her, and you
must aid me to do it."
"1I? how?"   inquired the  astonished
Misardo.
" You see, my friel," began Miguel,
"when once married, the fortune of Donna
Bananda is in my grasp."
"True; you will be immensely rich."
"Now, the difficulty is to get married.-

willing bride, and a priest. The bride [

"I should think not. But to get her con.-

"Therefore, you must get her away."
"Splendidly reasoned, capitano mio. I

concerning you. There is no place in the
world, where I can exercise such control
upon her, as in your ship, on a voyage
to Sicily."

" In my ship? It will be too expensive
to keep a lady. No, no, that would not do."
"I will bear every expense, and besides,

five hundred -- five hundred gold pieces are
yours."
"Five hundred ?"
" I have said it. Well, are you dumb ?"
" Five hundred gold pieces! and the
expenses! I will do it, my noble friend,

"Very well. Now, when do you sail for
Sicily? Start as soon as possible."
"Day after to-morrow, I can be ready."
"But, could I have some of your sailors
if necessary, to carry her off?"
"Yes.   So there is no danger.  But,
where will you get a priest ?"
" That, indeed ? I must see to."
"My brother is a priest," said Misardo,
"if youpay him well, he will go along."
" Will you manage it? Explain every-
thing, and have him on board. Can you
do it?
" How much do you authorize me to offer
him?"
" Fifty pieces."
"'That willinot be enough. Say a hun-

" A hundred, then. Now, all is arranged.
The priest will be here, and, go along with
us b Sicily.  To-morrow  afternoon, have
some of your sailors ready to accompany
me. At night, I think we can bring the
golden bird a captive on board, and in the
morning the ship weighs anchor. Oh !

After some furtl-er arrangements, con.

CHAPTER XXIX.
 THE INSURGENTS IN TH E NORTH.
IN a former chapter, the reader has seen
that, at the request of Dun Lionel, Queen
Eleonora resolved to intercede with Juan,
in behalf of the Israelites concerning the
suspension of the Inquisition. The entreaty
of the Queen furnished the King with a
most reasonable excuse to fulfil the promise
Massor had extorted from him.
After the Gipsy's visit, Juan had em-
ployed the most expert spies to dog the
steps of him who had in his possession the

the cave, when the sun rises."
"But, where shall we conceal ourselves?"
inquired one of the men.
"In yon clumps of trees behind the
castle," replied Massor, and the men
obeyed him.
Then the gipsy chief and Fidaro crept
under cover of the trees, that lined  the
high road close to the tents of the Prior's
camp. Sentinels were posted, within call of
each other, all around.
They approached one of them who guard-

down before the narrow gate that led through
the wall of palisades, defending that part
of the camp singing:

The soldier put down his weapon, and
said: Pass     .   .     .
In a moment the two stood in the camp.
They walked silently like ghosts through
the camp, not in the broad regular streets
but between the tents, and in a concealed
manner unt'l they approached the clear
space around the Prior di Castro's tent.
Translated from the Portugnese.

The tent leaned with the rear upon some
trees that garnished the outer edge of the
castle moat. Some of the branches over-
hung the roof, and from amidst the green
verdure waved the royal flag.   Soldiers
formed a guard around. They-lay in listless
attitudes, but very quietly, except ,a few

the tent, the resting soldiers, the sentinels
and the camp.
Massor and his companion by a round
about way arrived at the rear of the tent.
They had turned to the left and skirted the
free space until they came to the moat.
Massor halted for a moment and listened.
Allwas quiet. Then, proceeding along the
side of the moat, he reached a point directly
in the rear of the Prior's tent. He now
endeavored to pierce the darkness of shadow
with his sharp eyes.
"There is an uninterrupted line of trees
from here to the tent," he said. "Will you
not see, Fidaro, whether it is soV
Fidaro without a word plunged into the
shade.
"Shall I do it," now soliloquised Massor,
" shall I play false to the King ? He does
not mean to be true or faithful to me; he
does not intend to keep to his promises.

my principles require it, I must make the
best of the means which God placed at my
disposal. After all, I only work for justice
and right. I do not trust a King like Juan.
He will break promises. But when de Castro
has once promised, he never deserts his
word. - Ah, but will he promise? - No, I
am too well convinced that it is in vain. He
will not promise this. Yet the inducements
are immense. I can make or unmake him.
Well, we will see; try, I must."
" There is a straightline of trees, sir," re-
ported Fidaro.
" Then wait here until I call you," re-
plied Massor, and began to climb the next
tree with the agility of a cat.

the branches began to spread, he seized the

day, at the same time with father Domingo.
The priest had seen the King immediately,
and communicated the failure of his mission.
We can now imagine Juan's asto dishment,
when Don Antonio imparted to him the in-
formation that the Prior di Castro was in
Lisbon, ready to throw himself at his majes.
ty's feet Permission was immediately grant
ed, and the two brothers again stood face to
face.
The King, proudly kind and severe as he
endeavored to be, could not prevent a smile
of triumph from playing around his lips, and
the Prior, knowing his safety lay in submis
sion, controled the quick, bitter feeling that
welled up in his heart, aud, kneeling, kissed
Juan's hand.
"So you have, at last, recognised your duty,
senor?" inquired Juan, coldly.
"I have been misled by intriguing men,
my royal brother," replied the Prior hum-
bly.
"Misled? Children and fools are misled,
but not men."
The Prior's face flushed. He swallowed
his anger, and said:
"Your majesty pardons me?"
"If you will be worthy of my pardon."
"I will retire to the convent of St. Garcani."
"It is too exposed. The castle of Lisbon
is much more suitable."
"Does your majesty look upon me as a pri-
soner?"
"On the contrary, we shall be happy to
employ you in a station of trust. YQu will
govern the castle-" the King was silent,for a
moment, and the Prior looked at him in as
tonishment, for this he had never hoped-
"jointly, with the present governor," added
the King.
The Prior's eyes fell in disappointment.
What ths King had said was, in other words
a sentence of imprisonment. For though he
should actually be instituted as governor of

L S E C R E T,
the castle, yet he would be closely confined to
his own rooms there, and, though treated
with respect, would neither. be allowed to
move freely, nor to see his friends. His as-
sociate, the present occupant, would in fact
be governor of the castle, and jailor of him.
self. He ventured a faint remonstrance.
"I have religous duties to observe."
"Since you have disregrarded your duties,
as a subject, it will not harm you to neglect
your priestly observances. But we can fur.
nish you with scourges and bread and water,
in the castle as well as in a convent."
"I recommend myself to your mercy,
senor.".
The King turned away fromethe Prior
and looking at Massor said:
"So to you, I owe this triumph, I thought
you were mine enemy."
"I am your majesty's friend and servant'
But zeal for your royal interests did not alone
urge me to rob the rebels of their head, and
to bring him to Lisbon."
"I suppose not. You seem to have a pro-
per regard for your own interests."
"I never forget my interests, which in this
case are also the interests of your majesty's
people."
The King frowned.
"Let us discuss these matters alone. Call
the captain of my guard!"
The captain entered, and Juan addressed
hir. "Take a strong guard and convey the
Prior di Castro to the castle, as secretly as
it can be done. I have already informed the
governor of my wishes in regard to hin."
The Prior arose, and in bitter scorn, took
his sword and offered it to the captain.
Don Antonio, who stood behind the royal
chair immediately directed Juan's attention
to this fact.
It were, perhaps, as wall," said the King,
in a whisper.
"No sire, you would make the Pior pop-
ular. His misfortune would excite compas-
sion, and instead of annihilating his party,
you would cause it to increase."
"But what effect will this mild punish-
ment have on the rebels and disaffected?"
" tThey will think, the Prior has betrayed
them, anddeserted his own cause. For yet

apparently reward him, though in reality il
is imprisonment."
The captain had already taken the Prior'
sword, and was about to lead him away
when Juan said:
"Return his sword, to my brother. He is
appointed governor of the castle. Have a
care that you give him safe guidance through
the streets, and leave him not until within
the walls of'the castle. He has enemies and
his safety is dear to us."
With a bow the Prior replied to this
mockery, and throwing his sword upon the
floor left the apartment The captain, obe-
dient to a sign of Don Antonio, picked it
up, and followed the Prior.
"Now, gipsy, I have fulfilled my promise
to you, and I find you have been true to me.
Complete what you have bogun, and deliver
those documents into my hands."
"When your majesty has not temporarily
suspended, but totally abrogated the Inqui-
sition."
"It is very bold of you to broach this sub-
jeet again. Very bold of you, even to appear
before me."
"Bold, perhaps, but I incur no danger.
Those documents are a hostage for my safety."
"But by your own act, you have rendered
those papers 'iseless. The Prior's life is
now in our hand."
"You dare not murder him!"
"Idare to be just!"
"Let us talk plain. I have trusted in you.
I have rendered you an important service.-
I am about to give up to you the documents
which constitute your brother dangerous.-
I demand a reward."
"Your claims are just, and rewarded you
shall be."
"I demand the abolishment of the Inqui.
sition.'
"For the delivery of those papers?"
"And for my other services, in bringing
the Prior, a prisoner to Lshon."
Don Antonio whispered for a moment to
the King.
"Gipsy," said Juan, " the Inquisition is
suspended. So it shall remain at present.
If a week hence, I find it still necessary to
gain possession of those papers, I will give
up the Inquisition for them."

II

t   " Promise moe, that in either case the sus-
pension of this tribunal shall last for two
8 weeks yet."
The King thought for a moment and then
said:
"I promise. Depart now gipsy, and a
week from hence you shall know our answer.
Meanwhile, thanks, for the Prior di Castro."
Massor stood doubtingly, for some mo-
ments, and then said:
" May you be not unworthy of the trust I
repose in you."
Slowly he left the royal apartments.
As he descended the great staircase, a
bustle arose below, and presently appeared
a hale and hearty man of dashing appearance
and magnificently arrayed. A brilliant suite
of cavaliers accompanied him. The guards
saluted, and the master of ceremonies con-
ducted them to the antechamber. of the
throne room.
It was the ambassador of the emperor,
Ch arles V, to whom the King gave audience
that day.
In the antechamber they were detained
for some time, and then with the loud an-
nouncement of his titles, Senor, the ambas.
saidor, was admitted. The King received
him seated upon the throne.
Let us follow Massor, who, waiting until
the gorgeous throng was passed, inquired,
with trembling eagerness, of one of the ush-
ers, for what purpose the ambassador had
audience. The usher silently looked at the
gipsy, and then, without a word, passed on
disdainfully. Massor suppressed his wrath,
and hastened to the courtyard. There wait-
ed, in gloriously gay medley, the servants of
the ambassador's suite.  Ti e proud and
beautiful horses champed their bridles, and
moved impatiently. Massor began a con-
versation with one of the servants and, by
lint of soft replies to rough jokes, brought
the men to speak of the ambassador.
" Why," said the servant, "you must
have been abroad or slept, for the last week.
All Lisbon talks of this matter. Queen El-
eanora
" Queen EleanoralI What about her?"
" Why, she marries the brave King of

we came all the way from Valladolid to Lis-
bon, and that's why we are here, this morn-
ing."
The gipsy said nothing. but abruptly pass.
ed on out of the precincts of the palace, and
into the city.
"This is no news to me," he thought,
"and yet it pains me so much. I have nev.

Good heaven! Will this torture never end ?
Always, always Tantalus yearning for the
fruit. diving for the water, and always the
fruit out of his reach, the water driven from
his tongue! Great God! shall my whole life
fNll sacrifice to vain efforts ?"
An expression of intense agony distorted
Massor's features, as he half r.urmurred
these cries of a wrung heart. Even the two
men, who, sent by the King, followed his
wild and careless steps, felt a kind of com-
passionate fear, and increased the distance
between themselves and the evidently suf.
fering man.
It was easy to track him, for he seemed
careless of all external objects. He walked,
scarcely lifting his eyes to direct himself,
and muttering, in a low, stifled voice, broken
words and exclamations.
"AhI and I consoled her, I encouraged
her, when -. Good GodI how unhappy
will she be in the lascivious gaieties of that
country, and I - with the pain in my heart,
with the burning sore in my breast ! I knew
it. I thought myself prepared to endurepre.
pared to suffer, and now -now Iam mad."
He covered his features with the rim of
his slouched hat, and walked quickly out of
the city, in the environs of which they were
now, towards Belem. The two spies follow
ed him afar off. But Massor, generally so
careful and cautibus, did not even cast a
look at them. He had in reality no faculty
or attention to expend upon the caution
trouble, strife and demands of external life,
because all were absorbed and participated
in the terrible struggle that raged in th
inmost recesses of his soul.
"Aih," ho sighed as, weary of the agony
he endeavored to blot the subject from hib
thoughts, "we prepare ourself for death
too, we know that we must die, as surely a

we live, and-yet when the last hour comes,
how fearfully do we combat with the dark
angel; how powerfully do we struggle for
life. I prepared myself for this, it has como
and, Great God, what shall I do to stay my

from my brain ?.
Sometimes running, sometimes walking,
the gipsy reached Belem,. and, stopping at
the inn of St Ignatius, called to the keeper:
"My horse!"
A splendid black steed was brought, and
Massor, mounting, rode away. But the two
spies were not to be shaken off. Unable to
procure -hoises in time to follow the gipsy,
they concluded to dog him on foot,. which
was, after all, no hard task, as he rode very
slowly, and was still buried in his own
thoughts.
The gipsy rode to the camp of his tribe,
which was again upon the same hill, where
we at first met them, when Donna Gloria
escaped from the convent. Massor had
chosen, for his temporary residence, the
small cave, upon the suminit, which Gloria
occupied 'the night she passed with the
gipsies. F-om this cave he could not only
overlook the encampment, but it also com-
manded an extended view of the surround.
ing country  Massor gave some orders to
the crowd of gipsies that welcomed his ar-
rival, put his horse in charge of a young
man, and then ascended to the small cave.
When the spies, that followed him, had
carefully noted all this, from the top of t o
f trees, which they climbed the better to-
f observe his motions after arriving at the
gipsy camp, they returned to the next vil-
lage. Although extremely fatigued, they
tarried not, but, hiring two horses, spurred
on toward Lisbon immediately. Doubtless

, welcome intelligence.

or taken by violence? What is the cause of
the gipsy's sorrow, what the occasion which
stirred up those emotions of bitterness in
his soul? Does the chieftain know of Glo-

on that beauteous lady were shattered upon
the rock of her passions ?
We shall see. And coming pages will

Tis near the close of day. Rosa Bananda
sits eon an embroidered stool, pensively
gazing at the sky. In her hand dangles a
rose colored note, from which the silver
thread is pending. Casting her eyes again
upon it, she s3ans once more the page, and
presses it to her lips. Her bosom heaves
passionately, and her eyes soften with emo
tion, as she reads, in that murmuring voice,
so expressiveof surpr so and joy:
"Dearest Rosa: I irve returned, and, be

The letter had been delivered to her a
short time since by Maria Flunoz, who, after
Gloria's death, had entered the service of'
Rosa. A stranger had delivered it to her
with the  request to give it to Rosa when

believed in a speedy removal of all obstrue

Who knows not the delight, that, as it
were, pervades and intoxicates the soul,

Meanwhile the table was set, and the
victuals brought in.
"Hie has taken two spoons full the rascal,"
cried the captain when he saw the fry.
Miguel now knocked softly at the door of
the chamber.
Maria opened it, and showed her face
pursed up, and eyes bright with a vixenish
glance.
"The meal is ready. We ask Donna Ro.
sa to preside at the table," he said.
Maria exchanged a few words with Rosa,
and then said:
"My mistress wishes rest and quiet.-
Proceed without her. She will not see you."
The door was again closed.
The captain sent for his brother, who bore
the unctioustame of father Modestus, and
the three dined without Rosa. Miguel eat-
ing and drinking, and not knowing what he
swallowed or why, but-his whole mind bent
on finding means to gain Rosa's affections.

could lay hands on. After dinner, Miguel
and Misardo walked upon the quarter deck,
while the priest remained yet at the table.
"Well captain," said Miguel, endeavoring
to assume a humorous tone, which lay far
from his true feelings at that moment, "the
ship is going at a rapid rate."
"Yes, yes," replied Misardo, "a rapid
rate. How much have you left of your pa.
trimony, Don Miguel?" heinquired, suddenly.
"How much ? What insolence is this?"
"You may call it insolence, senor, but it
is only a proper regard to business."
"A proper regard to business that con
cerns you not. Believe me, Misardo, it is
best.for you to keep your mind on your own
ship, and your own concerns, for if you ven-
ture from these upon ground that is not
yours-"
"Well, if Iventure from these,what then?"
"Then you will be crushed under foot like
the snail that has left its house."
Misardo tried to look offended, but suc-
eseded not. This bold reply had put down
his spirit. Miguel exercised that control

over the captain, which physical strength
and courage is apt to usurp, and which Is
possessed in a far hither degree, by mental
and moral elevation.
" Be not chafed at my words, but in ar.
ranging everything as you wished it, I have
incurred expeuises which if not reimbursed
would ruin me," said the captain.
" What is the aim of all your twaddle ?
Have I not acted generous enough in prom.

"Oh surely, you have promised wellI
"What then is the meaning of your

"To promise is one thing; to fulfil, anoth-

"Dog of a captain! Do you doubt my

" I doubt not your word, but your ability
to fulfil it." 1
"My ability to pay?"
"Yes. Be not offended."
"What? Know you not the wealth of
Donna Bananda, and of her daughter?"
" That belongs to them; aid they will
never pay me for forcibly aiding to abduct
the young lady."
"But I will. Do you not see, blockhead?"
"Ah I ah!" sighed Misardo. "Your mar-
riage with the young lady is an idle scheme.
She would rather kill herself than marry
you. I perceived that at once."
"Did you? Know then, stupid beastthat
ere we arrive at Sicily she will be my wife.

" May Heaven aid you to conquer her!

had such a chance to gain a fortune, it would
pour fire through my veins, and I would go

Here the priest, who had, meanwhile, still
continued to eat in the cabin, rejoined them,
wiping the fat from his mouth, with his
dirty sleeve.I
"Brother," he said, "I have observed
three important facts, on board of your ves.
eel."
"What are they, Modestus?"
"In the first place, the lady you have on
board is beautiful!"
"1We know that," replied Misardo.
"Is she in the cabin?"  inquired Miguel.
"Perhaps not now, since I have left," said
the priest.
"What do you mean by 'since I have
left?' Came she there only to seek you," said
Miguel.
"I imagineso," replied the priest, "since
the fair one said it herself."
"1What could she want with you ? Speak,
gross abomination of priesthood!"'
"Address me with proper respect, senor.
For though I am here to serve you, it is in
my proper dignity and office. lit officio Dei'
The lady bespoke my protection against
your wild attacks, senor, which I granted."
"Alh, indeedI " replied Miguel scornfully,
"and how will you protect her?"
"By stepping -"
"Fool," cried Misardo, "all the chance
we have of being paid by this gentleman,
rests on the accomplishment of his wishes,
and the success of his suit with this lady.
What induces you to meddle with other
men's concerns?  Keep your dirty fingers
in your own empty pockets."
" That alters the case, fratre io I Still
the lady is very pleasant to look at. Con-
cerning your advice to keep my dirty fin-
gem in my own empty pockets, know, infidel,
that these fingers, though dirty in the flesh,
are spiritually pure, and full of salvation.-

If my pockets, perchance, should be emp-
ty--"
" Thy belly is nevertheless full," broke in
Misardo.
"A very just observation. Now to the
second fact that has attracted my observa-
tion. Your cook puts not enough garlic to
the meat."
" Pshaw," replied Misardo, "his cookery
is expensive enough, since he uses two
spoonsful of fat to a fry."
" Holy RosandaI If he can make a fry
with two spoonsful he is a real artist. But,
regarding the garlic, he is too saving; my
stomach, even now, complains of the unsa-
vory meat. . Promise me, my brother, for
the sake of my -precious health, that you will
speak to the cook, on this point."
"Very well. Quiet your perturbed spirit,
holy father, and let us know the third obser-
vation you have made."
"My third observation is concerning my
grandmother's bedstead. She had to sell it,
poor, dear woman, for she needed money.-
Having agreed to sell it to one dealer, for a
certain price, she happened to meet another,
to whom she related her first bargain.
I will give yon so much more, said he
and will pay you in good money; for the
other man is a counterfeiter.
My grandmother then immediately took
his money and soid, therefore, the bedstead
to him."
" In what manner, oh dirtiest and most
stupid of priests, does this bng rigmarole
apply to anything on this vessel?" inquired
Miguel.
"In this respect, worthiest of gentlemen,"
replied Modestus. "My brother of a captain
and myself have made a bargain with you,
concerning the carrying off.this lady. But
now the second dealer, or this lady offers to
pay double the sum you promised for bearing
back and liberating her. If we keep the
agreement with you, sir," addressing Migu-
el, "we assist in a piece or rascality. If we
bear back this lady, it is an act of the high-
est virtue."
" Al, traitor," cried Miguel, striking the
priest on the cheek.
" Al, fool!I"  cried Misardo turning his,
back upon him.

now so proudly reject!"
Rosa grew pale, very pale; still, with the
dignity of innocence and grief she said:
"Senor I you are mad. Pray, relieve us
of your frenzied ravings."'
"Frenzied ravings. you call them?  If I
act madly you are the cause of it, and you
shall be the cure. Enough of mutual re-
proaches. Come, my love, and kiss me."
Miguel scarcely had pronounced these
words, when he was at Rosa's side, and had
his arms twined around her. With all her
feeble strength the maiden wrestled, but to
nopurpose. Miguel's face was close to her's,
and his burning lips touched her cheek.
Rosa, unable to disengage herself, angry,
terrified and disgusted, criea loudly for help.
Aid however was at hand; Maria had con-
sidered how best to serve her mistress; see-
ing Rosa struggling in Miguel's arms, she
approached anddrawinr his own sword from
the seablrd at his side, pushed him back
with one hand, while, in the other, she bran.
dished the glittering weapon.
. " Back, coward," she cried, "or I will kill
you with your own sword."
- "Kill, me, and I shall'at least die in her
arms!" cried Miguel in passionate frenzy,
drawing Rosa closely to his bosom.
Maria was undecided for a moment, and
then resolutely thrust the sharp point of the
sword into Miguel's shoulder.  A sharp
pang shot across his chest. It was only a.
flesh wounJl; it is true, yet the blood spurted
out, and the nerves throbbed with the shock,
which always attends, more or less, any in-
jury. It is generally a great difference to
say "' Kill, me," and to feel the cold steel en-

CH APTER XXXV.
THE wRnCK.
"The ship has sprung a leak!" Through
the howling winds and the roaring sea, loud
and clear like a sentence of death, rang the
announcement- Deatg was everywhere ! in
the storm and the waves, in the lightning's
flash and the thunder's voice, above and be-
neath, death scowled and grinned at the few
human beings that crouched, helplessly, here
and there, upon the-rapidly filling vessel.
That cry was heard by Rosa and Maria,
rung in the ears of Miguel and Misardo, and
shot line a bolt of terror into the hearts of I
all on board of the St Pedro di Alvendi.-
The violence of the storm had decreased,
somewhat, and the winds had paused, as it4
were, to look upon the wrestling of the ship I
, with its fate. Alas the struggle would soon
be over, since, creeping waters already gush-
ed into the ship's heart through the wound
in her side.
- Rosa rushed out, and joined the group t
.upon deck, who, as a last recourse prayed to I
Him who rules the winds and waves.
" Help us, help us, Great GodI" cried the
priest, his demeanor, actions and language
being elevated by the greatness of the emer i
geney, " help us, father of the sea and the p
wind! Help us, for the sake of the women a
and children whose husbands and fathers a
are here!,Help us for the sake of our sinful
souls, that we might repent ! Command thy v
angels to sheath the lightning, and to hush v
the storm. Command the waves to bear us s
up! Help, help thou our saviour, our only u
friend.- The waters roar around us, they b
swallow us, help!"  The voice of the priest s
gradually rising, sounded like a trumpet, up e
o the -storm. He, all, were praying 'with
passion, with frenzy, were struggling in their t
prayer for life, for existence.         5

Misardo had been absent,,but now he
came from the cabin, loaded with small bags
of gold, which, stuffed into the lining of his '
clothes, swelled him up very much.. Indeed,
he was so loaded that.he ceuld but m~ive
with the greatest difficulty. : For, loath to
leave any of his treasure, he had endeavor-
ed to stow away a fortune in the lining of
his dress. Some very valuable jewels were
fastened to the inside of his shirt uponthe
bosom. Taking little heed of those engaged
in prayers, who were still upon their knees,
he shouted: "Make ready the boats! "
A wave washed the ship at the same mo-
ment, and, sweeping along those sailors, that
had not secured themselves by, grasping
ropes, spars, or like supporters, dast them
against the bulkheads. Some were bruised,
while others remained uninjured. Among
the latter was Rosa, among the former. Mi.

along by the violence of the wave. Migu
had an arm broken, the priest a flesh wound
on the side of the head.
In spite, however, of the storm and the
continual rise and fall of the billows, the
boats were ready in a little time. Not too
soon; for already the ship fell.heavy and
solidly upon the waters, and sank almost be-
neath them at each motion. Misardo, well
acquainted with the strength of the repec-
ive boats, sprang into the smallest one, fol--
owed by his brother.
"Shove off, Modestus," cried the captain,
'or too many will enter."
"No, brother; there is Don Miguel bring-
ng the lady, she shall go with us." The
priest had, through all these trying evens,
ssumed and retained an irresistible air of
uthority. Miguel, with Rosa and Maria,
and the boatswain Joseppo entered the boat,
which then,nearly 'full, was shoved from the

CHAPTER XXXVI.
GOD I    NEAR THE HELPLESS.
A ship is driving through the foaming waves
on her way to the straits of Gibraltar, and
to Portugal. She is a large, bulky vessel,
and rolls about from side to side like a fat
burgomaster. Her breadth of beam, heavi-
ness of spars, and indeed her entire lcok
denote that she was built in Holland. There
is such an exquisite air of heaviness and
substance, of strong fat sense and guilders
about Dutch built vessels and men, that the
merest dolt could not inistake either of them.
We have said that the vessel in question
was Dutch; and this is saying much in her
praise, for at that time Holland was one of
the very first maritime nations.
Let us take the reader on board. Well
protected by an awning, that overshadowed
the greater part of the cleanly quarter deek,
and resting on small carpets, spread upon
the deck, we meet four gentlemen. In one
of them we recognise Sporaso, the captain
of the vessel, in the other two Hernando and
Enrique, and the small fat man, with the
good natured green goggle eyes who always

polishes his nails with such industry, is a
Jewish physician, a cousin of the captain.-
The name of the lattetr is Moses ben Moses.
"Perm'it me to observe," said the captain,
"that in Holland, the merchant, and the
artizan are becoming of greater importance
every day. There is also a splendid, a vali-
ant and wealthy nobility, yet each day weak
ens its power And importance. It will at
last disappear from the face of the land."
"I cannot conceive such a state of things,"
cried Hernando, "A state without nobility
can not but fall. Who will defend it against
the enemy without, and check the power of
the monarch within ? Who will protectthe
nation, enforce the execution of its laws and
protect the fine arts?  Would Rome have
become Rome without Patricians, to lead in
battle, protect in' peace and patronise the
arts.? Would Greece have become the land
of refinement, of poetry and beauty, wit'ont
noble patronage to foster the flowery enlight
enment of the age ? Take away tne nobility
and you have a barbarian people left."
"You are warm in your arguments, senor,"
gravely replied the captain. "That the no-
bility was great, and perhaps good in some
states of society I will allow. Yet in the
present advanced age who will acknowledge
the claims founded merely on blood,or descent
foiom a great and virtuous ancestor ? In our
Holland, we show the solid strength of a na
tion, in which the nobility is a nonentity, in
which King and nation are the only estates
acknowledged. And do not our burghers
produce greater men in every department,
then can be made of the weak saplings of an
old family?  Were not the great men of
science and action, the great navigators anl
astronomers, the great heroes of ancient and
modern times, all of the people? "
"Hold, there, senor capitano, "said Her,
nando, "the great men of ancient and mod-
ern times, say you ? Let us see. Was not
the Roman Brutus a patrician?  And the
Roman heroes and poets all w ere of noble
houses. -Do we not see in ancient history,
whether, of Greece, Rcme, Carthage, Syria
orPersia, that when ever the rights of peo-
ple were assailed, the people defendedthem
ol when stirred up to it by noblest.defen
de'them under the lead of the nobility."

At. SECRET,
"The nobility always defended - its own
rights and privileges under the pretense of
defending the people's rights. On the con'.
trary, whatever oppresses the nation must
increase their power, and in whatever
country the nobility is rich and great, the
people will be found weak and poor. But
when the nobles are powerless, then com-
merce,-trade, and agriculture bloom, and
yield their rewards to the man of the
people who works to gain them," said the
captain.
"See how crooked the notions of this
good captain are," said Hernando. "He is
a traveler, has been in England where I
have never been, knows, therefore, better
than any the prosperity of that nation, with
its hereditary, wealthy nobles, and yet as-
serts all he has said. Is this not ridiculous?
He knows further history, and is well ac;
qiainted with the fact, that the liberties of
England, greater than those of any other
land, the seeds of the greatest and purest
freedom that can ever exist, were wrested
in the fagna Charta from a tyrannical
king, by whom? By Nobles, by Barons and
Earls. Further, look upon the knights of
the romantic ages the knight errants, and
crusaders, and then can you maintain, that
they were not the cultivators of poetry hnd
the patrons of art, the redressors of wrongs
and guardians of justice, the benefactor of
an ungrateful people? They were the men
who freely dedicated their lives and posses-
sions to a high and great idea, the men of
holy enthusiasm, graad soul and, grand de.
velopment of physical power."
" But let us discuss the principle of the
thing,' said the captain, who unexpectedly
found himself getting worsted in this argu-
ment. "Let us see whether-it is right' and
just that, because a father has been wise or
brave, and, therefore, deserved nobility and
honors, his descendants' should enjoy the
same for all times, however depraved and
useless they are."
" I think it to be right, and just senor,"
replied Hernando. "Look you; do not you,

should inherit the money which a private
citizen might have paid him, for certain
services ? You may as well maintain that
the child has no right to the father's naine,
as that hereditary nobility is unjust. Even
our divine law, the scripture inspired by
God, sanctions this principle. And ' the
merits of the father shall be remembered
to the last generation,' is repeatedly men-
tioned. What is hereditary nobility but a
commemoration of the ancestor's merits
and virtues in his descendants ?  Then, in
our history, the history of Israel, do we
not find that God established the house of
Dgvid to be a perpetual royal race ? And
everything that is said in defense of heredi.

hereditary nobility."
"But did nature create men, to ba differ-
ently privileged and endowed with different
rights,or to enjoy an equal justice andright?"
asked the captain, scornfully.
"What a question," cried Hernando,
"Did not Nature herself endow man with
widely different capacities ? Nature can not
but create the perfect and the imperfect.-,
For the substance to create both is within
her, and therefore it is a necessity that both
should exist. Therefore men, more or less
perfect in mind, soul, or body, men that differ
as greatly in their physical, mental and mo-
ral capacities, as the mountain differs from
the valley, and the sheaf from the thistle, live
and move. in this world. Has not nature
then , invested with greater privilege one
man in the physical, mental or moral advan-
tage he has over an other ? Seems there not
to be a nobility among animals, plants, and
even stones?  Ah, do not say nature made
mnan equal, for equality is a principle that
can not exist in a well ordered state of
things. All can not be heads, all can not

equality is an empty ideal."
" Then you do not even concede that equal
justice should be meted out?" inquired the
astonishedcaptain. .
" Equal justice? What call you equal
justice. Fitting one and the same straight
garment upon men of different sizes and
proportions? Should justicebe justicephere
must be different laws governing each indi-
vidual case. Justice is not just, unless she
considers the minutest shades of feeling
which actuate man. , Human justice can not
do that. But divine justice will. And ma-
ny arogue that has been hung here accord-
ing to the most just laws, will be received
into Paradise by God. For God's justice
must be just, just to men in their weakness,
and in their different mental, moral and
physical capacities. Thus justice to be just,
can not be equal."
The conversation ceased there. For some
moments, silence reigned on the quarter
deck, until a sailor disturbed the company
by the announcement, that a boat was in
sight, and the people in her were making
signs.
Their lazy languor was thrown off in amo-
ment, and all hastened to the forecastle to
make out the boat. Those who have crossed
the sea, know the languid stupor which to
the casual passenger represents life on ship
board. They know how incidents of the ve-
ry slightest importance and interest, are ac-
cepted and grasped at,as subjects for though
during the long, weary hours. And so here.
Each one strained his eyes to see the small
dark speck upon the water, which seemed
gradually approaching them.
" Beyond doubt, it is a boat," said, the
captain after a long look.
" Can you not make out what is in.her?"
inquired Hernando.
"Not yet. See, they are throwing out
something white. Can you not see it wave?"
" Yes, I see something white in, motion."
"What can it mean ? A singleboat thus
alone on the sea! Captain, what are your
conjectures about her?"  inquired Enrique.
"I suppose the boat contains the survi

"Was the man handsome?" inquired En-

"No, surely not, and therefore I could
not have suspected what was in it."
"What was in it? Well,will you speak?"
"It purported to be from Don Enrique da
Costa, and contained an entreaty to meet
him secretly, at the garden door. I gave the
note to my mistress who seemed to rejoice
greatly thereat. We waited till all in the
house were asleep, and then at the request
of my mistress I followed her into the gar-
den." Maria hadto stop. She was yet too
weak. Enrique walked the quarter deck,
bursting with impatience. Yet he could
not urge Maria beyond her powers. After
a short rest the chambermaid resumed :
"We had scarcely opened the garden,
door, when a man in a large cloak and hat
approached. My lady cried: Enrique! and
threw herself into his arms: Meanwhile

"And pray, why don't? Was it not a vil-

"1Go on, for heaven's sake," entreated En-
rique, "I am dying of impatience. You
were saying -"                      ,
"II was saying, that these fellows fell on
me, like mad dogs, and dragged me along to
a boat. Meanwhile, my lady, had discovered
that the man whom she embraced was not
Don Enrique, but her cousin Don Miguel.-
And as she raised a great cry at the decep-
tion, he fairly took her up and carried her
to the same boat, where they put me.
"They then rowed to a ship, calledSt Pedro
di Alvendi, and I understood, that the mean-
ing of this black villany, our abduction-was
that Don Miguel intended to force my lady
to marry him. They had a fat monster on
board of the ship too, a priest, who was to
perform the ceremony; he is a pious 'man,
that I doubt not, but a priest of the-church
should not lend his hand to such villanies.

There was also a stingy serpent of a captain.
"The ship immediately started in spite of
my lady's entreaties to let her return. Oh,
I can not tell you then, of the terrible perse-
cutions of Don Miguel di Sousa. He tried
everything possible to cajole or force Douna
Rosa into an union with him; but all in
vain. At last he attacked her person."
"Dastard, Villain and Forger I God help
him if we meet."
" But with his own sword I drove him
back. Again he threw something over mhe
and locked me in a small cabin room. Then
came on the storm- Oh, thatnight of terror
I shall never forget. Heaven have mercy
on us ! -I thought the last day had come.-
We were wrecked, and driven about on the
sea for near three days, ere we met you."
"But where is that monster, who carried
off my sweet lady?" inquired Enrique. ,
"Yonder cabincontains him. Heescaped
in the same boat, and was saved with us."
Enrique briefly thanked Maria Flunos,
and then with hasty strides went to the cab-
in door and endeavored to enter. But here
he was met by Moses ben Moses.
"You can not see my patients now, and
especially the lady. She has much need of
rest, and her frame can not bear the least
excitement."
" Not her, but that large man with the
black hair and eyes," and he endeavored to
pass.
"I can not allow you-positively not," re-
peated the physician. " You cant postpone
your business with him, until he is well."
"How soon will he be recovered?"
"In a few days. Refrain from   seeing
any of these weak people until then; pray
do," and the physician locked the cabin door.
We turn to Hernando. What was it that
rose and burned in his bosom, and like the

love ? It was. And love of Rosa? Assured-

dead. It appeared, not as a ghost of former
affection, but as a living fire, bright and hot.

that had crazed his brain when he threi
Enrique from the tower.
But experience had come-since then. H

swallowed the fire-filled cup of crime, an
the horrible recollection still stood a warn-
ing shadow in his bosom. But, and alas
thus is man, he felt, indefinitely, vaguely
but still strongly, that could he enjoy Rosa'i
love, upon the ruins of Enrique's life, could
he wed Rosa upon the grave of his brother
he might, he even now might-
"Down with you worm, serpent from Par
adise I1" cried the young man, stamping up
on the deck. "Down, and poison not my
soul by thy insinuations. I will never touch
his life ! Never decide by rude combat the
rivalry of our souls. Yet it is impossible he
can love her. He enjoys her embrace, her
kiss, the glorious consciousness of her love-
calmly, joyfully, but oh so calmly. While
I would feel heaven in her kiss, divine fire
in her embrace, and for one moment's con-

should embrace her, my lips should inhale
her breath, my bosom should heave against
her own, like a sea of fire. Oh God I- alife
of ambition, hope and glory, for one embrace,
and esteem myself blest1!"
Then Hernando wrestled with himself and
endeavored to force down the great selfish
spirit that he had called up, endeavored to
combat with passions that he had strength-
ened and nurtured, and stimulated, and felt
an intense joy, though a guilty one, when
the passions conquered, when his better self
sank exhausted, and the inward wrestle was
ended with the victory of self, with the con-
quest of the human over the divine, the
earthly passions over the soul which is part
of God. He felt joy,satisfaction, and having
convinced himself that his love was trium-
phant,sagelyset about considering the means
to accomplish his purpose. That Rosa
would love him when she knew the fire, the
greatness and intensity of his affection, he

w unconquerable because he had succumbed
to it. He imagined his affection invisible

and his whole soul usurped by the fiery and
wild flashes of his love for Rosa. Beheld

some pebbles and small stones that were
heaped about there, and unearthed the
precious steelen casket, in which the proofs
of the Prior di Castro's legitimacy were
contained.
When the guard returned to Lisbon, the
King heard with doubt and vexation their
story about Massor's power of belching
forth fire. However, the gipsy was only of
importance as the possessor of the casket,
and the King now held the very documents,
that had given him so much uneasiness, in
his hand. He hastened to deposit them in
the strongest and most secret closet he
knew - in the closet where the papal bulls,
the royal wills, marriage contracts and
papers of like importance were kept. Now
King Juan again was firm upon the throne
of his fathers.
And Massor! Do you see the man who
stands solitary in the pale gray of morning,
under the sleepy green trees at the slope of
the hill? It is Massor; alone with his
thoughts, he leans against the knotty and
warty trunk of a chestnut, the empty bottle
still grasped in his hand.
1 "This, then, is t'e end of my power over
King Juan, " he said. " I could not help it.

fleeting and reflecting until the multitude
of thoughts dimmed his mind; dreaming
of great purposes to be achieved, and
noble ends to be reached, searching for
means, for ways to achieve them, and still
meeting icy failure on every road and in
every attempt; thus he stood in middle
age on broken hopes and lost years, still
failing to grasp his wished for end, to reach
his glorious goal.
How many do thus'live, and die at last
without the achievment of their purpose ?
We know not. But in the dark undereur-
rents of history we find the remains of
glorious plans, the ruins of lofty attempts,
which were never known by cotemporaries,
and the originators of which lie unremem-
bered in some humble grave. Every system
has had its  martyrs. Its martyrs that
marched in the van and died, that it
might come into existence, and the mirtyra
that followed in the rear, and died that .it
might continue to exist. Some of these
martyrs we know, and honor their memory..
Most of them have died - died, to be for-
gotten. No human institution has ever
flourished without being fed with blood,
has ever fallen without burying men under
its ruins. Massor, as yet, is a riddle. But
he is a grand riddle. And when at last he
will solve the mystery, the solution will be
greater even than the riddle.  . -
The morning broke; oh how beautiful,
dewy, fresh and glorious. Golden threads
stole through the gray woof of the early
shadows, and formed brilliant combinations
with the fresh living hues of heaven and
earth. The happy green trees, the laughing
rollicking skies, the flashing water, oh
how I love them at early morn.
Massor seemed again awakened to life
by the invigorating'breeze of morning. He
slowly walked from the trees, amidst which
he had taken refuge the night before, and,
drawing his hat down into his face, walked
towards Belem.
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
TREE RIvALs.
Love is of two kinds. Calm, earnest and
deep love. And warm passionate love. The

first is true, the latter not. True love will
never use grand expressions, will never
manifest itself in a rolling and talkative
tongue. On the contrary. Less words are
perhaps exchanged with the objectof true
love, than with any other person. Those
words are generally common place. Still
there is an attraction towards each other in
the parties, sudden, inexplicable.  When
together, each trembles, grows pale, blushes
and is awed in turn. When hearing of the
loved object, the same phenomena occur.
It is an exquisite tenderness, an extra-
vagant friendship, a holy admiration which
elevates and purifies the heart. But only
the heart - not the manners, expressions
and figure. For having no material in-
gredients it acts not upon material nature
It calms rather then disturbs the rythm of
the soul. It is so spiritual that it can exist
at the same time with a gross earthly
passion, and desire for another object, yet
be not disturbed by it. It is divine, there-
fore everlasting. It is the perfect agreement
and harmony of two souls. True love seeks
to hide its emotions. It never paints to the
world what the heart enjoys, never speaks
of what the soul feels.
We speak now of other love. It is not
gross desire, but far, far above it. It is a
fiery admiration, a passionate attraction, a
vain-glorious sentiment. Yea a sentiment to
which vanity, self-love, and a desire of con-
quest each furnish theiringredient. It is a
violent stimulant, an inebriating emotion.
It desires, it must have. It will conquer
every honorable, moral and religious ob-
stacle.
A vain-glorious passion like this, though
somewhat mingled with the purer, higher
love treated of before, was the affection of
the old knights. Noble and valiant cheval.
iers, that maintained their lady's beauty at
the swords point, and proclaimed her favor,
heralded the mystery of the kiss and em-
brace in all lists and courts throughout
Christendom.
It is needless to apply this rule to odr
characters. All will have classed Enrique
amowg the first, Hernando and Miguel
among the latter kind of lovers before this.

L SECRET,
Soon Rosa was well enough to leave the
cabin, and sit in the quarterdeck, enjoying:
the cool sea breeze. She was. happy,. and
every one knows what a capital remedy,
happiness is; it soon restored the healthy'
tint of Rosa's complexion, relighted the fire,
of her eyes and the bright coral of her lips.,
Hernando was more than ever in love
with  his brother's betrothed.  He now
sought, and often found chances to talk alone
with Rosa. Yet when Enrique was by, his
manner was so calm and tranquil, his con-
versation so respectful and brotherly in his
tenor; when he was alone with Enrique, his
praises of his brother's choice were so un-
selfish, so amicable, and without the least
spice of passion, that all suspicion was .dis-
armed, and Enrique firmly believed Her-
nando had never loved Rosa, and only at-
tacked his life at Salonga in , a it of delirium
and madness. This occurrence itself was
never again mentioned, or even hinted at,
between the brothers. Enrique had for-
given the act, and Hernando tried to forget it.
However, in Rosa's company alone, since
the Duteh sailors around were no obstacle to
their conversation in Portuguese, there was
a warmth and passion in Hernando's words,
which alarmed the pure hearted maiden.
But since that passion presented itself not in
a definite form, since Hernando rather hinted
at than directly spoke of love, and even then
never as of his own, such conversation could
not be objected to. He had a rich voice, and
often used to amuse the passengers by singing
ancient balladsin the starry hoursof evening.
Till now, he had not been able to arrange
it that Rosa and himself should meet alone
at evening. But such a chance at length
occurred. Enrique was in the cabin. Mi-
guel had now so far recovered from his
exhaustion and' broken limb that the phy-
sician ordered him to be allowed the liberty
of the deck. Enrique had, therefore, gone
to speak to him first. We shall detail their
conversation hereafter. The captain was
occupied in writing; Misardo and Modestus
were still confined to their hammocks; Maria
stood on the forecastle engaged in a con-
fidential chat with Jossdpo, the handsome
boatswain, and Moses ben Moses, the physi-

eia, lay on the quarterdeck musically snor
ing. So Hernando    found himself alon
with Rosa.
The sky was so grandly blue, the se
so vast and mysterious, the sparks of the
waves so glittering, and every star so lofty
and white, that the very atmosphere of th(
night breathed softness, beauty and love.
Hernando again spoke in his warm strain
of conversation to Rosa, until his remarks
and protestations, almost oppressed her. I
seemed to her as if a cloud floated above
from which some evil could every momen
descend on her head. To change the subject
Rosa asked him to sing. Hernando, there
fore, took the lute which he had brought
on deck, and sweeping with masterly skil
across the strings so as to produce a rush
of melody, threw  back his shining hair
looked with inspired eyes up to the starry
sky,'and began, in a voice powerful, deel
and rich, to sing an ancient ballad, which
he had long selected for an occasion liki
this. The fine sounds were thrilling witl
the emotion, the truth of feeling, whicl
the singer poured out with them, and were
well calculated, together with the subject o.
the ballad, to touch Rosa's heart.
Eduardo count of Alsantar
Did love Elise the fair,
Elise the pale, the matchless one,
The lady of Calaire.
Her eyes were flame, her hair like night
Her features pale as snow;
And many lands had fair Elise
And many suitors too.
And yet she liked the valiant Count
And promised him her hand;
The count was then the happiest man
Of any in the land.
And many to the wedding came,-
And came among the rest,
The brother of the valiant count,
Alphonse, of knights the best.
And when he saw the beauteous bride,
In satin and in gold;
,The. brightness of his cheek was gone,
And paled his glances bold.
And though he strove and struggled sore,
He gaitied no rest, no peace,
For Alphonse loved with all his heart,
The beautiful Elise.
He met her in the garden lone,
And trembling said: Oh stay.
1 8

I'll tell thee of the fiery love,
e   That eats my life away.
'Tis thou I love, Elise, 'tis thou,
a   Have mercy with my pain;
And say that thou wilt fly with me
To countries far from Spain.
e   Oh, tell me that thy heart replies
To feelings true as these;
Oh say thou wilt be ever mine-
Mine own, my loved Elise.
The lady raised in scorn her eyes,
Her lip of scarlet curled:
Thou know'st I am thy brother's bride,
t   In sight of God and World;
t   Thou cast not offer wealth and rank
.   No counties broad and wide,
S   And therefore, though I love thee well,
I'll never be thy bride.
And though I love your brother not,
I'll be his countess high !
And so she turned away again
With scorn in voice and eye.
P   And gaily smiled the golden sun,
And sweetly sang the breeze;
And chirping notes of merry birds
h   Were falling fromthe trees.
'And Alphonse looked one more at her,
Oh, wildly throbbed his heart!
He stabbed himself with shining sword,
f To still his throbbing heart.
And when the lady saw the corpse,
She beat her aching breast;
All night, all day Alphonse's ghost
Would never let her rest,
Until she took the sable veil-.
Became a nun for aye;
And humbly knelt in holy church,
For sinful.souls to pray.
This simple and rude ballad was supg
with such splendor of voice, such depth of
expression, that Rosa leant her head upon
her hands, and her tears flowed silently
through them. Hernando himself was so
much affected by it,that big tears rolled from
his eyes.
"Donna Rosa," he said in a voice trem-
bling with passion, "do you not pity the
poor knight Alphonse, and regret the cruel-
ty of the lady?"
"I pity Alphonse's fate ; the .lady was
wrong to, marry for wealth and rank, but
after being betrothed to his brother could
not but reject him."
" Yet she loved him. Oh, Rosa let me

What did Rosa think, what did she re-
solve upon, in the perplexing condition, to
which Hernindo's passion brought her?
Tell her bethrothed, she could not. For,
like an evil wind, the recollection of Her-

her heat, whenever that idea presented it-
Elf. ' That threat, so terrible, so probable
in its execution, so in harmony with Her-
nando's character and passion, was not only
aa effectual preventive of Rosa's confiding
into Enrique, regarding this matter, but
also served to frighten the anxious bride
into an at least apparent attention to the
words and protestations of the passionate
young muau. At one moment she thought of
coniding into her mother-but no! Enrique

tore, should she? After her marriage, when

is misplaced affection, and the vanity of
his hopes, he would abandon those wild
thoughts and wishes, would cease to per.
secute her. Till then there was no help.
She must. endure, and endure patiently
as possible.
Enrique joined his brother, shortly after-
ward. His eyes were beaming, oh so bright-
ly, with happiness and gayety. His face
was radiant, as if bathed in a beam of
pupshine and love. His dress of snowy
white satin, edged with broad rich crimson
ad laced with gold, became well the happy
occssion and Enrique's joyous face. He laid
his hand covered with a glove of soft white
leathmr,upon Hernando's arm, and looked at
bis brother for a time in silence. Hernando
was attired in orange velvet, embroidered
and laced with silver. He answered Enri-

"Brother," said Enrique, "you' see my
happiness. It is more than I deserve."
" Ah, Enrique! you know that I have no
ambition but to see you happy. You weie
made for it.' You can enjoy it. But I, I
could not content myself. I should find joy
such as yours but a dull mistress." 1
"Tastes and capacities of enjoying happi-
ness are as various and unequal as the
means to acquire it. Yet, my Hernando, I
often marvel that you have not yet selected
a partner for life. You have always been
an admirer of the fair sex."   -
"All will come in due time, Enrique.
You are happy now. Wait until I choose,
and we will see who has made the best
bargain with fate."
. " Oh, I do not fear to compare my bride
with any you may wed, or, indeed, with
any lady in existence. Don Lionel has not
yet arrived. Do you think he will come ?"
" Aye, aye. There are his pages with the
lion of Judah and the star of Israel on
their sleeves.  And now himself enters.
Majestic and serious as ever. "
Both brothers hastened forward to wel-
come Don Lionel Dian with the greatest
reverence.
A smile of ineffable brightness fitted for
a moment over the pale, majestic features of
this great scion of Judah's royal race. It
was the smile of one who had known
earthly joys and felt their sweetness; of one
who had seen those joys burst in his grasp ;
it was the transient gladness of one who had
blown glorious bubbles of human happiness,
and seen the air lift them beyond his reach.
" I congratulate you, young gentleman, on
your choice," said the Hebrew prince. "It

triumphed. By your management in Rome,

of male vanity, that he resolved upon firmly
but gently to reject every advance of his un-

decided him to keep the appointment and
meet the unknown.
There is nothing like evening, nothing
like sunset. When I say nothing, I mean
in external nature. For there is something
very like it as the end of life, at the death of
man. When the good man dies, the sun of
the soul once more blazes up, and its rays
are reflected from the bright glory of his
life. Red love, golden piety, purple wisdom,

ness upon the clouds, whose dark face, his
course of life has changed to light. When'
the wicked man dies, the sun throws flakes
of feverish light, blushes of hectic gold upon
dark clouds that might have beenbrightened
- that have remained dark. Those streaks
of light but show the darkness, that hectic
lush is but the sign of internal disease.-
The wicked man's dissolution seems like the
dissolution of day in a thunderstorm.-
Where the gold 6f piety has given way to
lightning flashes of remorse, and the gor-
geous sky to clouds of despair. Is not the
death of man like sunset? His life in this
world like the busy, selfish, troublesome,
day ? His life hereafter like the sweet, calm
night.  *   *    *    *   We return to
Lisbon.-
The day put on its many colored dressing
gown, shed its golden eyelashes, and sank to
sleep on the dark bosom of the Atlantic
ocean.
Hernando entered the beggars' square.-
It was a street renowned for assemblies of
the beggars, and, even now groups of them
reclined, stood, or sat in thick profusion,
upon the pavement. Some were counting
the coins they had been able to gather dur-
ing the day. Others were relating their ex-
periences, and the success of their own pe-
culiar manner of begging. Still others dis.
cussed the topics of the day-the King, the
Queen, the Emperor,India,Asia,the Cardinal

These beggars made an immediate rush
at the richly clad stranger entering their
square, and Hernando had much trouble to
free himself of their importunate entreaties
by a plenteous donation of silver coin.
He reached the Hostelrie of the Santa
Madre., A picture of the Virgin Mary in a
Spanish mantilla, standing, with giant feet
upon a heap of doughy clouds, and lifting
two hands loaded with rings, towards a
streak of dirty yellow, designed to represent
heaven, was the glory of the inn. This
picture occupied the center of the front, and
was flanked on each side, by a window.-
The windows that had the honor to guard
the Virgin Mary,.were both open, and a fe-
male figure stood near one of them. When
Hernando approached the small private door
of the inn, this figure quickly disappeared.
In another moment he had knocked and was
admitted by the burly man that had brought
the note, and who was the innkeeper. He
escorted the young nobleman to a chamber
in the second story, and left him alone with
a lady, that rose on his entrance.
"Senor, you are welcome," said the lady.
"Donna Miranda! Is it.indeed you that
have favored me with the note?" inquired
Hernando.
"It is senor; I am happy that you are
come. You see I was awaiting you."
" A h, senora, and what is it, that you wish
to communicate to me ? If I can aid you by
word or deed in anything, rely on pe."
"1It is not to ask for aid that ladies invite
young gallants to meet them alone, and se-

Miranda, impatiently. "It is for-, d9es

but the frame of a weak, soft and ungallant
spirit ? If so, our interview is ended."
"1Had a man said this, he had died for it,"
returned Hernando. "Senora, my soul is
fiery and bold, my blood warm and youth-
ful, but--"
"Enough, then; come! " and Miranda
seized his hand and drew the young man to
the window, where a bright mass of moon-
shine streamed in. Till now her head,
shoulders, and the upper part of her body
had'been wrapped in a Spanish mantilla of
thick black lace. But now, with a sudden
movement she threw this half veil, half cloak
off, at the same time disengaging a shawl
worn beneath. Miranda then stood in the
bright moolight, attired in a robe of black
satin, edged and embroidered with gold.-
Her snowy neck and dark, heavy hair; her
soft, black eyes, full, rich lips, and features
of a-beauty enchantingly charming; her
brow and cheeks flushed with soft blushes;
all enhanced by the effect of her black and
gold robe, were displayed before Hernando's
eyes,in the bewitching moonshine.
"Look at me !" sighed rather than said
the beautiful lady.
The young man's eyes drank in her soft
beauty. -.Still he moved not, spoke not, but
by calling up his resolve, again and again,
callingup thejmage of Rosa, prevented him-
self from falling at the lady's feet in admira-
tion.
"And I love you, love you," continued
Miranda, bending toward Hernando, and
letting her softbreath sweep over his cheek.
"It is too much,"faintly faltered the young
man, every glance melting his resolve.
"Ilove you, sinc6-  no matter how longI
-   I love you now.--Come to my bosom-

oh; I am thirsting, thirstingifor your love."
With a strong effort Hernando recovered
- himself.
1  "Senora, this is not seemly for me. Your
beauty would tempt me to do what I should
repent of. Let me-"
"Oh," cried kiranda, in rage, stamping
her foot, "I shall go madI He is ice, a being
of ice. ;Senor, do I understand you to say
that you refuse my love?"
Her eye was threatening, full of immense
wrath as she said this.   "I
" Senora, I can not, believe me, I can not
return your passion. I love-- "
"Enough, senorI Enough, disgrace to be
heaped on the heart of a woman who loves.
I thought you were a man. You are a child.
We are enemies in future I You have re-
fused my love-my hate shall follow you-
aye, my hate, which is not so despicable as
you think perhaps now. Good heaven - I
thought to revel in fire, and have approached
a bosom colder than the aged limbs of my
husband! Away, senorI Away with youI
Your manner has maddened me. Believe
me, an unsatisfied, a rejected heart can hate
terribly.'"'
As she stood there in fierce anger, Her-
nando thought her beauty even greater than
before.  Her eyes burned, her cheeks
were a glow, her form dilated, and her whole
appearance was terribly beautiful. He was
about to throw himself at her tfeet- seizing
her hand, he knelt, he drew her toward him,
when the lady cried:
-"Do you add scoffs to insult, scorn to re-
jection ? " and lifting her arm in a threaten-
ing manner she left the apartment.
Hernando was glad of it. He was happy
to have been put beyond temptation. He
was sure, had she stayed a moment longer
he would have given all earth up for her.
Even now, his blood run swiftly through his
veins and arteries, and his pulses were
throbbing. Even now, his nerves trembled
in hungry desire. Even now his heart beat
with passion, mad passion.
However, Miranda had left. This beau-
tiful being had left him in anger. For this
he cared little, and, while making his way
out of the inn and home, layed his heroism,

his fortitude in withstanding these tempta-
tions, a soothing balm upon his regretting
breast.
And Miranda ? She had scarcely returned
home when a paroxism of mad passion and
anger seized her.  Every mirror flashed
back her splendid beauty, every mirror re-
flected her shame. For she was still at-
tired in the atin robe, particularly selected
to enhance her charms in'Hernando's eyes.
So she had failedI Had made the first ad-
vances, had confessed her love, had urged it
upon Hernando, tried all the, charms of
her person and manner, and'still been---
rejected, scornfully rejected as she believed.
And also failed in satisfying her craving
and wild passion.
There is, there can not be, as the poet
has ju'stly observed, in hell a fury like a
woman scorned. No other insult is like-it,
no other insult awakens so much rage. In
a nature like Miranda's, who was a pro-
ficient in hate as in love, who had lived in
courts, where both these passions assumed
their worst forms, who had served Madame
Luise de Savoy, mother of the French king,
hate grew terribly strong and quick.
Miranda had   learned  at the  French
courts how to hate according to a system.
She would not wait for chance or fortune
to satisfy her hate, but would, of herself,
begin the work, and endeavor to destroy
Hernando immediately. Knowing nothing
of his character, manners, ways, relations,
she resolved that destroyed he must be, and
already plans to that effect haunted her
mind.
Let us leave this character, bold and bad,
but characteristic of the times. It is the
duty of a novelist to exhibit vice in all
shapes, all excesses, in which it indulged in
the times, or countries he describes. His
task would be but half done, were he to
present bright, glorious men, and cast a,
veil over vice and sin. The times I describe
were passion stained and rich in vice. I
have painted, occasionally, in dark colors
but rather let my picture be displeasing
than untruthfuL  Miranda'is a character, a
type of court ladies of the sixteenth cen-
tury, and I have not hesitated to do her

justice, both in describing her vices and
merits. Has the reader's delicacy been of-
fended, it is well; for the evidence of a
pure heart is to feel repugnance to .vice ;
and this picture will have the effect of
strengthening the love of virtue in pure
hearts, since no gloss is thrown over the
ugliness of sin.
CHAPT-ER       XLII.
"HELL HAS NO FU RY LIKE A wo-
MAN SCORNED.i'.
The clock strikes twelve; the cool night
wind bears the silvery sounds far over the
green tops of Mount Cintra. The village of
Belem is silent and dark, with the excep-
tion of the steeple of Maria Annunciata,
which, all bathed in moonshine,points to the
azure sky.
However, a close observer might have
seen a golden thread of light struggling fro&amp;
the closed shutters that barred the windows
opening from the vaults of the inn, Saint
Ignatio.  Again, dark, and dusky forms,
muffled in cloaks, were skulking along the
streets from the river, and the highway,
keeping in the shadows of the walls and
trees that they might remain unobserved.-
As each approached the inn, he kissed his
hand, and then pressed it against a small
tin case (fij~tt) placed on the door post,
when the portal swung open, and the person
entered, taking the precaution to shut the
door after him. All but a few stragglers
had entered; amongst them we recognize two
figures. The one, in hat and coak, hastily
striding along, and seemingly buried in his
thought, was Hernando da Costa. The
other in the dress of a gay page, with white
plume concealing the- face, and sweeping
down upon the shoulders, is Miranda. - For
the proud lady had assumed that dress, for
the purpose of concealment while watching
Hernando. "No man's life is pure," she
thought, "and, if well observed, we may
find a weak point, in every ones character,
wherefrom to attack him successfully.--
And, since I wish to ruin Hernando, I must
first of all ascertain that weak point, This
can only be done by a close system of obser-
vation. But my passion, and my hate is

my chambermaid and myself, Therefore,
my cham.abermaid shall watch him in dis-
guise, and, occasionally I myself shall fol-
low him." She acted accordingly, and now,
in the disguise of a page, followed the un-
concious Hernando to the secret meeting of
the Israelites,'
Imitating the example of the others, she
pressed against the small tin case, and found
that the clasp which fastened it to the post,
contained a spring, a pressure on which un-
looked the door She entered through some
dark vaults, into the large and well lighted
ball, which served the Israelites, as a house
of worship and council, whenever they could
safely meet. From friend to friend, from
Israelite to Israelite, amongst the nobilty
and the commons, at court, in the navy,
army, ot behind the showy counter of ware-
houses and places of businessthe announce-
ment'had ciroplated, and been whispered
by Jewish tongue to Jewish ear, that a grand
meeting was to'be held in the hall beneath
St Iguatio's inn, and that Don Lionel Dian
would preside at thatmeeting.
This was the cause of the gathering of
the crowd, that now presented itself to the
eyes of Miranda.
There was a hum of expectation, followed
by silence. Don Lionel Dian arose, and
spoke:
"Brethren I Fellow sufferers in the holy
cause I Fellow patriots of Israel, and de-
fenders of God's word I At length have we
escaped from the danger, and again has the
Lord snatched his own from the serpents'
toils. We have, with our Gold, wrung from
the corrupted, head, of a debased religion,
protection for ourselves and families. But
the dangerwhich-we have removed, was un-
doubtedly brought on us by the anger of the
Lord. And wherefore was lie angry with
his children? Because Israel had left him,
-had deserted his laws had inclined to the
doctrines of the Nazarine. And now that
the danger is past, will we not return to
Him, whoi through all ages, has proved our
'tiend, our Father and our God. Yea, Is-
'kaelites-I- your prince, and.your own hearts
call on you to renounce every strange

AL SECRET,
thought, to be sanctified, to love your God,
to obey his commands.
" It is true, that, for the present, the dan
ger is averted, but what trust can be put in
one, who has already shown himself - to be
corrupted. Therefore, be not deluded, the
serpent's coils are not yet unwound, but
only loosened; at any moment, may they
again enfold us in their close embrace and
it plung its poisoned fangs deep in our
hearts.
" Our necessities command, that, in out-
ward appearance, we should be Christians,
but beware! let your hearts not take a liking
to the mask. When aione with yourselves
and with your God, strip off the hateful
shell, and let theilight stream into your soul;
that light which comes from Zion, and beams
from the holy MountI Brethren, take'
courage, draw your swords, gather together,
sons of Israel, the Lord will send his mes-
senger, the Messiah!"
This speech, full of enthusiasm and holy
fire, failed not in effect upon the hearer.-
The eyes of the young men flashed, and even
the old participated in the excitement Don
Lionel Dian, sat down, and now the leaders
of Israelites gathered around him, and held
council concerning the circumstances of the
times, and the measures to be taken for
avoiding the cliffs and sandbanks, which
still surrounded their race.
Before dissolving the meeting,'Don Lionel
again arose, and said:
" Let those present now depart. On the
evening of Monday next, another meeting
will be held, and then we shall instruct, ac-
cording to our best knowledge, and council,
all with our experience of the way to obey
his God, while living according to the neces-
sities of our exile. Monday evening a reli-
gious service will be held, the service of
the New Year. Let all, women and men,
come to serve their God, and proclaim the
Lord one, high and mighty, merciful and
just, the humiliator of the proud, and com.
forter of the suffering. Meanwhile depart
in peace.'
The assembled multitude rose, and silent-
ly left the hall. None but some of the old-
est and wisest Israelites.some learned Rab-

ORt, PLOTS     AND
bis of the 1mud, and some wealthy and
noble leaders of the nation, remained with
Don Lionel Dian, to consult on the welfare
of the people.I
Let us return now, to Miranda, disguised
in the dress of a page, who had followed
Hernando to the secret assembly of the Is-
raelites.
She had entered unseen, and placed her-
self behind a pillar, some steps from Her-
nando, As a matter of course, she saw and
heard all that passed. This knowledge
hoarded in her bosom she left the hall with
the throng, and walked on heedless of the'
direction. In a few moments her thoughts
reverted to present circumstances. She
looked around for Hernando and the rest of
the Israelites. They were scattered, here
and there, returning to the town, or to their
habitations in Belem and the surrounding
country.
"1I will return to the city now," observed
Miranda to herself. "I have all I want.-
Oh Hernando, you have scorned me! insult-
ed me! Revenge is a cooling breeze to the
scorched heart, akid I shall have it, satiate
myselfI His whole race shall be destroyed!
The blood of hundreds will wash this insult
from my bosom! And yet he is so hand"
some ! so manlyI Ah, if he would but now
consent to satisfy my passion, and to accept
my love! If he would - but no ! expose
myself to repeated scoffs ? He has once re-
jected my love -I will reject pity, his
nation shall bleed for it."
Thus thought Miranda, and battled with
herself, as she went along the road to Lis-
bon-hard, fatiguing journey for her unus
ed to much exertion.   But, the pain pf
body, and its fatigue, was as nothing to her,
before the thoughts of the mind, the war-
ring emotions of the senses. Senses, for we
are unable to say whether Miranda's heart
was greatly concerned in- her passion for
Hernando da Costa.   I
- Anger and hate, with love, hopeful in
spite-of rejection, were having a great strug-
gle in her mind. Finally she had come to a
resolve, and stopping for a moment cried:
"1Revenge is sweeter yet, and rarely can

C O UNTER PL OT..S.              151
I enjoy it in such quantity. I will .destroy'
them all. Their sentence is spoken."  i
And then,she ran with great speed towards
Lisbon, whose suburbs were soon reached.
The dream-distilling goddess of night-
had hung her diadem of stars upon -her
azure hair, and spread her dark transparent
skirts over the earth. Broad beds of purple
blackness and crystal moonshine rolled over
the verdant land and corrugated sea. ,A
song, like the rushing of the mysterious
waves of Eternity's sea, like the billows'of
time surging away from the Earth, rocked
in the air. It seemed each vast minute
could be heard to drop from the earth in
the still fanciful night.
And through this 'night Miranda borel
home to the mansion of her husband, her
burden of hate, and her revengeful thoughts.
CHAPTER         XLIII.
MAN CAN NOT AVERT HIS FATE.
No I man can not avert his fate, and there
are two grave reasons for it. In the first
place, no soothsayer or teller of the future
has ever arisen, whose word was author-
ized sufficiently to appear in the eyes of
men as the absolute flat of fate. Secondly,
men recognise events only as fate, after
they have happened. A necessary corollary
of the position .assumed in the foregoing
two sentences is, that man does not know,
therefore can not avert his fate.
Donna Miranda had been announced,'aid
now entered the saloon, in which His Emi-
nence, the Cardinal Savelli received -stran-
gers. The Secretary of the Cardinal, Pater
Domingo, was present, standing behind the
chair of his Eminence.
"Seat yourself, daughter," said the Car-
dinal, calmly, answering Donna Miranda's
salutation, by a nod;' "seat yourself, and
communicate -wherefore you demand audi-
ence with us.   Vt e are -servants of the
Church, and our ear I always open to
the voice of poor humanity."
"It is not to'confess and not to pray, holy
Father, that I have craved audience with
you," replied Miranda, with some affectation
of awe. But, before I begin, let me remark

CHAPTER XL VI.
THE ESCAPE.
All of 'the Israelites had been hurried
through a short trial, and many of them con-
demned to the stake, some to be maimed
and imprisoned, and a few to penitence and
banishment. The goods of all, as a matter
of course, became the property of the King
and the Holy Tribunal. The Cardinal
Grand Inquisitor had deputed Pater Domin.
go, the secretary, to take possession of the
private property of the prisoners, and make
a list of it, for the benefit of the royal officers.
The. King had entrusted the execution of ta
favorite plan to the Cardinal, which thelat-
ter also placed under-Domingo's charges It
was, to distribute the children of the cog-
demoed New Christians on' various African
isles, where they might grow up without
knowledge of Judaism, and become pious
Christian settlers.,
Pater Domingo had attended to both these
commission. . Ships were. provided which
the Pater sewly manned, jn order, as he

tion of the royal andf nquisitional orders.-
For the character-of the new erewhe vouch.
ed.
They were drafted from various parts- of,
the Kingdom, and with;such celerity,that
four days after the trial of the Israelites,
each ship was.manned; the children of the
Israelites wrre placed on board of one ves-
sel, and their most valuable treasures on the
other. - The fist to be ,carried to 'African
Islands; the latter to be conveyed to the
King, who was journeying in the South of
Portugal. At that time, even more that
now, the conveyance by water was sonsueh
better and safer than by land, inPortugal,
that things of value and important were
generally sent -by ships. - Thereibre,-Pater,
Domingo acted'quite honestly in-freighting
a vessel with the confiscated treasures'of the
condemned Israelites.
Onthe evening of the day when they had
received their cargo, both vessels stood 'out
to sea. The Cardinal Gtand Inquisitor, in
very wtrin Wers, expressed his' thanks to
Pater Domingo for the dispatch'he had used.
There were two other vessels laying be-
hind the rocks of Cintra, in a small bay full
of dangerous eliffis and sandbanks,' which
seemed for some days past to b6waiting the
arrival of their cargo. The first was i ship
of Dutch make; at its side lay a smalletrone,
though also of considerable capacity' The
latter had great breath of beam, but a 'light
and easy build.
They lay at anchor in a bay, wherethey
could not be approached, but from which'
they could not emerge without- foundering,
unless the most skilful of pilots held-the
rudde. 'Around them were ragiagbreakers
and shallow sandbanks.

Senor,--" here he stepped to the window,
and glAnced out, "You, senor, must answer

for the authority, title and state assumed
unauthorised, for the forgeries committed."
Savelli turned pale and a livid hue rose to
his lips and encircled his eyes.,
" What is this?" he stammered.
But at that moment the doors were thrown
open, and while a lackey announced noisily:
"His Eminence the Lord Grand Inquisi-
tor of Spain,
"His highness the Count of Ildemonte,"
two gentlemen entered the apartment. One
a priest, the other a soldier. Domingo step-
ped toward them, and pointing to the pale
nd trembling man, in the ivory chair said,
scornfully:
",His Eminence the Cardinal Savelli."
The soldier who was no other than the
Count of Ildemonte, immediately laid his

"Iazpest you in the name of the emperor."
Savelli sprang from his chair, as if a ser-

"I arrest you, in the name of the holy

Savelli stamped his, foot, and uttering a cry,

consciousness, that boldness only could give
- him safety at least for the present, as well
as the perception of the ridiculous posture,
he occupied, in relation to the other persons
present, served to revive all his courage, and
even to stimulate it by shame. Erecting his
body and lifting his head with anger, bright
eye and flushed cheek, he stepped several
paces forward, and said:
"Inquisitor General of Spain, I know you,
and your proud arrogance well! But here,
I am Inquisitor General, instituted by the
Holy Father, recommended by the Emperor,
and accepted by the King of Portugal. Who
gives you the right to use such expressions
to me. How shall. I understand your beo
havior, how interpret your words?"
" This pride is not in its place, man," re-
plied the Inquisitor.
" We have assurances by his Holiness
that he has entrusted you with no mission.
We have letters from the Emperor. He also
has given you no recommendation. The
King of Portugal you have deceived. But
we have sent messengers to him and his
highness will yet arrive in time to judge
yout offenses. You have committed heinous
offenses. Forgery amongst them."'
"You have committed high treason against
Carplo V, Emperor of Germany and King
of Castile and Arragon. I arrest you in his
name."
"I protest against these proceedings, my
Lord Grand Inquisitor of Spain! My Lord
Count of IldemonteI I am a Cardinal, a
member of the holy college, and as such only
responsible to the head of Christendom. No
prince, no prelate can call me to account."
" WE call you to account. Increase not
your offense by obstinate pride. You are a
scoundrel, senor, a rascal, mean as the dirt
beneath my feet; I will not soil my fair
manners, by further converse with you.-

You are a convicted criminal already. Here

The chain-of guilt is complete. Had King
Juan appointed you Inquisitor, it might have
been a partial shield to you; but, Cardinal
Savelli pretended to bear his office from the
Holy Father. Senor, thank me for the grace
to make this clear to you." Thus spoke the
Spanish Count.
Savelli's features again fell, and paled be-
fore this plain and crushing recital of his
guilt, his helplessness, his fall.
"Senors," he cried in a. piteous voice,
"whatever you have against me, have I not
founded the Inquisition in Portugal, not
spread the power of the Church and Holy
Tribunal? Deserve I not consideration on
that account?"
The Count of Ildemonte was struck by
this argument, and cast a doubtful hesitating
look at his companion.
Savelli observing it, continued: " My fall
will be the fall of the Institution I founded.
Let me, therefore, prevail, for its sake. Nay,
senors, peacably ye can not possess your-
selves of me, in the midst of my familiars,
and the city that honors and admires me,-
I will resist, if you attempt it."
The Count said to the SpanishGrand In-
quisitor:
" Perhaps his objections merit some con-
sideration. The Holy Tribunal must not
suffr."I
" The Inquisition will remain. But its
head may not be impure and corrupt. It
will flourish under manner white, pure and
just. Not under the flag.of a cheat."
With this he sounded a small string of
steelen crosses depending from his girdle.-
Four Spanish familiars, that had accompa-
nied the Grand Inquisitor entered. Savelli
attempted to strike his rattle, and summon
his attendants. But father Domingo pre-
vented him. In a few moments he was bound
and gagged. He would have cried, but a
hood had been thrown over his head from
the first. Domingo opened a secret door,

and theCardinal was taken away, while the
Inquisitor General of Spain took possession
of his apartments and papers.
The King had arrived in town that morn-
ing. In the forenoon yet, reports of Savelli's
deceit, the escape of the Israelites, which
leaked out quickly, and the disappearance of
the vessel with the confiscated treasures
reached him. He was convinced by this
that treachery had been at work and laid it
to Savelli's charge.
Meanwhile he sent three fast sailing ves-
sels, well armed with cannons, and manned
by marines after the fugitives, whose vessels
had been observed. at Belem and the coast.
The Cardinal's deceit, making him the ridi-
cule of all Europe rankled him most. He
was almost maddened by it. Some time af-
ter, at Savelli's trial, the King revenged hini-
self by sentencing the pretended Cardinal
and Grand Inquisitor, to ten years -service
as a galley slave. The proud adventurer
was, in the sight of Lisbon, chained to the.
galley bench.  Verily, the vengeance of
Kings is terrible.

On sped the two vessels, with the Israelites
on board, still they were but slowly making
headway. Let us turn to the larger of the
two, Captain Sporaso's vessel, for there are
the persons that interest us most.
All are in white shrouds. Their faces
white and pale as the rumpled garments.
For food has not passed their lips since the
evening before. It is the day of atonement,
a day of fasting and prayer, a day of eon-
trition and purifying of sins, a day when
earth is thrown off, and the soul climbs one
more step towards heaven.., Thiqday, the
fugitives neglect not in their flight; they
keep it holy, thrice holy, because occurring
at such an eventful period.
The prayers have floated with the ocean
breeze over th  calm surface of the sea.

"You are tired and weary?"

"But you ought not to tire of praying."
"It is true; my father, says so;" replied
the boy. "But I should like--?

"Perhaps. But, to the God in the human

" He is angry because I talked on the day

ed as if with a simultaneous electric shock,!
the fatal sight had drawn every eye to it,
rather than that one had whispered it to the
other, from the captain down. The cry arose,
from the mast head:
"Sails, in sight!"
The :captain reconnoitered through his
telescope. Every one crowded around him,
breathless with anxiety.
"Vessels from the King's navy;, they
hang out every rag of sail, in our pursuit,"
announced Captain Sporaso.
"Adonai Elohim help us!" cried the ter-
rifled multitude.
"1To prayer! it is time," proclaimed the
sonorous voice of Aaron Rodow, who, heed'
less of circumstances, attended only to his
duties.
And from terror and anxiety, from the
waves of fear that surged around, that holy
-call snatched them, snatched them  away
from consciousness of danger, and brought
them to God, the God, to whom they, this
day, atoned for their sins. The pursuing
ahips, the angry Inquisition, thQ. sorrow and
trouble of earthly life were as wiped away
from each mind by that call to the service
of God.*
The prayer, the song recommenced. The
forms were bent, the white woollen prayer
scarfs, with long fringes, drawn over each
head, and the young, the fair, together with
the aged and deformed, all clad in ghostly
shrouds, rocked and swayed to and fro, in
the intensity and passion of prayer.
And the murmuring sea, accompanied
the hymns and the psalmody. The mighty
organ of the ocean woke its sweet sounds
and rich tunes, to waft those prayers aloft.
And through the air of cerulean blue,
above the tangled silver cloudlets, the
hymns and sounds rose, beyond the golden
sun and the stars, and fiery comets, beyond

Te philosophy of the heart grander than

Captain Sporaso, however, was less en-
thusiastic concerning these religious ser-
vices, and the Dutch sailors of his vessel
cared nothing at all about it, since they
were for the greater part Protestants. So
this brave captain gave orders and h's men
set all sails that would draw. Thus the
ship proceeded at a very good rate through
the water. In fact she sped like- a hawk,
but the three royal ships pursued her like
eagles.
If you had been there, you immediately
would have seen that the Israelites could not
escape the Inquisition, and that in so many
hours the royal hips must come up with
Sporaso's vessel, and the small schooner at
its side, since their rate of sailing was much
more rapid. You would also have seen that
the pursuers did not exert themselves very
much, while the other vessels were doing
their utmost and crowded on sail by sail, to
catch each breath of wind.
The wind blew steadily and briskly from
the South East.
, Sporaso's vessel endeavored to go N. N
W., and, therefore, was almost driven before
the wind. The others in pursuit having
the same direction, had also the same advan-
tage of the breeze.
"They will reach us by the time night
comes, said Sporaso.  Escape by flight is
impossible."
The boatswain Joseppo proposed:
"Let us approach the shore. We may
cautiously venture into shallow water where
they can not follow. At night we may, per.,
haps, escape under cover of the darkness."
"A good thought indeed," cried the cap-
tain; "Joseppo you have won a new jacket
by tis advice."
"Thanks, senor," replied the gratified boat-
swain.

Oa, PLOTS AND COUNTERPLOTS.      169

The captain called his lieutenant.
" Vai Utlopp, it is not possible to escape
from these vessels, by holding on our pres-
ent course."
"Nein, Mynheer."
"Do you know of any plan to elude their
pursuit."
"Nein, Mynheer."
"Then, listen. Along the shore for seve-
ral miles above Cape Caroveiro stretches a
range of sandbanks and breakers out into
the sea."
e "Yah, Mynheer."
" If we make way for it they'll think to
have us sure. The breakers in front, they,
behind. We shall be lost then in reality."
"Nein, Mynheer."
"Why not, Van Utlbpp?"
"Why not, Mynheer ?"
"Aye, why not?   There is a road for a
ship right through the breakers and sand-
banks. Do you mean that?"
" Yah, Yah, Mynheer."
"At thisI was hinting. But do you know
that it is the most difficult thing in the world
to prevent a ship perishing there. The way
runs around and between the most hideous
rooks, crooked, bending, turning at many
points. Who will pilot us-through this ? I
have some knowledge of the strait, but far
too little to attempt pilotage there. Yet thii
isour only chance of escape. Who will pilot
us ?
" Ha, ha, ha, very good.  A  fine joke,
Mynheer."
' "A joke? Alas, not. What mean you,
Van Utlopp ?"
" Why I will pilot you through it, yab,
yah, Mynheer."
The captain, in excess of joy, almost em-
braced his fat Dutch lieutenant.
" You can do it ?" he cried.
"Yah, Yah, I can, Mynheer."
Sporaso knew that upon each of the lieu-
t6nant'swords implicit trust might be set, as
-regardedsea matters. He hesitatedno more.
The vessels approached the coast. The
smaller one immediately ran for a shallow
basin opening in the shore, whence the royal
ships on account of their heavy draught
could not follow. But Sporaso's vessel, turn-

ed in a slightly northerly direction, and
bore immediately down upon the breAers.
There they extended, far out into the sea, a
long line of hissing foam kind angry waves.
They seemed a sno  patch upon the darker
surface of the sea.
A continuation of jagged, movie or les
prominent rocks, interspersed with high
heaped sandbanks, and deep whirlpool pits,
formed this bar, so dangerous to the unskil-
ful mariner. The vessel was bearing right,
down on these breakers to the evident anx-
iety of all on board. The captain, howev-
er, knew this was the only chance of escape
from their pursuers, and also knew the ea-
quisite skill of his lieutenant.
Van Utlopp had ordered most sails to be
taken in, he had put the seamen in readiness
duly spirited, and prepared, that his slight-
est orders might be executed immediately,
and properly. He made them understand,
that if the ship failed only once to obey his
direction, that if they hesitated but once to
execute any duty, however dangerous, the
next moment would find them struggling for
life amongst the breakers. Thus all was
ready for the attempt to sail through the
narrow passage, the terrors of which all felt
end had heard of, but which none perhaps,
except the captain and lieutenant had made.
Let the reader impress the circumstances
on his mind as I will present them now.
The three royal ships were coming down
with spread sails on Sporaso's vessel; they
had gained very much on the latter through
superiority of sailing, as well as by the alter-
ed course across their track which it assum-
ed. The smaller companion was hidden in the
shallow basin extending inland. And the
vessel itself was cautiously,slowly but surely
approaching the roaring and foaming break-
ers ahead. The sun about to set. The wind
dying. The prayers of Atonement about to,
cease.
" There will be a storm, Mynheer t" said
the lieutenant.
" Aye ; the sun sets in a vivid green sky. I
do not like the banks of clouds in the South
West. We will probably have a storm from
that quarter."
"Yah, Mynheer."

"It must not break loose before we have
passed the breakers, else we might be lost,
Van Utlopp."
' We might, Mynheer."
"However, the cats' paws, which already
stretch the sails, will be advantageous to
drive us through."
. We must have them, Mynheer."
We have no other wind."
"Yah, Yah, Mynheer. Let me go to the
rudder." And Van Utlopp, went to steer
the vessel through the dangerous pass, for
already, within a few cables length the foam
boiled, and the ugly rocksgrinned above the
sea. Each seaman was at his post. The
ship was ready for the encounter. And all

ping. Unconscious of their great danger, of
the attempt-to escape, of the glory which the
setting sun poured over sea and s'ky, and of
the hissing breakers threatening ahead, they
worshipped, atoned. Now the last procla-
mation of the high day rose on the evening
air. The proclamation of purified hearts,
joyful souls, of beings at peace and in love
with their maker, of creatures adoring their
God.
"Hear, oh Israel, the Lord thy God is
One!" cried Aaron Rodow.
" Hear, oh Israel, the Lord thy God is
One," responded the hoarse voices of the
congregation.
-" The Lord, he is God !" and seventimes
Aaron Rodow proclaimed it, with sevenfold
response from the congregation. And as

swept over the waves, the half disappeared
sun, once more seemed to rise, and a flood
of golden light was poured over those earnest
men in white shrouds, and those snowy-at-
tired ladies, The sky once more lighted up,
and the golden gates of heaven seemed to
open in the West. A moment after, and
darkness extinguished the bright colors on
the sea and sky.
And over the waves was borne the voice
of the cornet, as it sounded the call:
"To your tents, oh Israel" 
The day of Atonement had expired. The
prayer ceased, the fast was broken.

0CH.APTER XLIX.
THROUGH THE FOAMING BREAKERS.
A dark nightit was; unusually dark. But
the white foam that indicated the hidden
rocks, and fringed the more projecting, was
plainly visible through the darkness. The
ship had entered the passage.
The royal vessels lay to. They were sure
that the fugitives could not escape during
the night. For the land behind, the break-
ers before them, and the three vessels with
their attentive watches forming an impassa-
ble cordon on the side toward the ocean;
how could they fly. It was a thing of im-
possibility, a good joke to think so-imagin-
ed the royal captains. As for the passage
through the breakers, not one pilot out of
fifty was able to make it, and certainly none
would attempt it, at night, and in an ap-
proaching storm. It was, therefore, a settled,
a sure thing, a absolute fact that Sporaso's
vessel and the flying Israelites were corner-
ed, were caught as if in a mouse trap.
And among the breakers, the vessel dart-
ed, like an eager warrior. On each side,
curling wreaths of foam stretched in long
rows, and wound in tangled lines. Only
where the vessel had entered, a dark furrow
marked the passage. At the helm, stood
Lieutenant Utlopp, the captain at his side.
The countenance of the Dutch sailor, but
now so insignificant and flat, seemed to rouse
and grow intelligent, grow sublime, with the
emergency. The dull eyes flashed, the hea-
vy mouth assumed a noble expression.-
Lieutenant Van Utlopp was a changed be-
ing. He seemed lord of the waves, and a
champion arisen to combat their fury.
" The storm will soon begin," said the
captain.
"Yah, Mynheer; in an hour."
"The breeze is already quite strong."
"Yah, Mynheer. Too strong for us."
He raised his head a little, and eried in
a calm, distinct voice:
" Reef the mainsail, reef closely."
The order was executed, and the ship's
speed immediately abated. Now a comb of
jagged cliffiets barred the passage. The
vessel bore directly down upon them, and, it
seemed as if the next moment would spike

it, a wreck,upon the rocky points. Enrique,
whose anxiety drove him to the rudder,cried:
"We are lost!1 God of Mercy I "
"Nein, Mynheer," replied the lieutenant,
with his strong arm turning the rudder, and
wearing the ship several points round, so
that it passed within the shortest possible
distance of the rockb, and turned into the
curve of the passage.
Now they seemed about to be thrown on
the breakers,then topush into smooth curling
water above sandbanks. Every moment al.
terations were made in the course of the ves-
sel, toadapt it to the tortuous passage. The
lieutenant seemed a giant moving the ship
hither and thither, by his short quick com-
mands, as if it were a toy of his leisure--
The captain stood at his side lost in admira-
tion and anxiety.
The storm had also. risen. Loud and
blustering, furious, it swept over the open
sea and rolled huge billows inland, and
dashed them to mist upon the rocks and ser-
rated shore. The ship could scarcely main-
tain herself. There wascontinual danger of
her being thrown upon the rocks. The sails
were all close reefed. Still, the waves, the
wind, might at any moment, strike her for-
cibly upon the side, and, with irresistible
power sweep her upon the cliffs.
However, the end of the passage was near.
Through the breakers they-were already.-
But, where they emerged, a long rocky point,
sharp and foam-fringed stretched far out
from the land into the sea. It was, in fact,
a sharp, dangerous tongue, which, in the
form of an eagle's beak, the convex side turn-
ed to the South, formed the upper boundary
of the breakers. Around the point of this
the vessel must pass, with the storm blowing
almost directly into its teeth.
It was hard work; but the good ship, un-
der command of its lieutenant, managed it
well. When they had almost reached the
point Van Utlopp commanded:
"Be ready to throw out the top sails."
Several sailors manned the shrouds.-
Scarcely had the point of the cliff been reach-
ed, when the vessel was worn, and at the
lieutenant's command, the topsails were un-
furled.

A moment's expectation-a heavy strain-.
a bending forward of the vessel -and the
point was made, the ship was on the other
side. A sharp, short crack, like the explo-
sion pf a pistol followed almost immediately.
The topsails were torn from the yards, and
borne along as rags on the breeze. Had
this happened a moment ago, the ship would
have been wrecked. But "nein, nein," said
the lieutenant. It did not happen.
CHAPTER L.
THE PRINCE-THE GIPSY-THE PUIIEST
King Juan had, immediately upon the fall
,of Savelli, appointed the' Cardinal Georgio,
Grand Inquisitor. This was done not only
without the consent but against the wishes
of the Grand Inquisitor of Spain. But the
King had the right to act independently in
this matter, and he used this right. Cardi-
nal Georgio, however, assured his majesty,
that the papal consent to his choice should
not be wanting. He was, therefore, fully in-
stituted in the high office, a few days after
his predecessor had been taken to prison.
One of Cardinal Georgio's first acts, was
to dismiss Pater Domingo from his office, and
the next to have him arrested, on charge of
liberating the prisoners of the Inquisition.
An inquiry into his guilt, was immediately
instituted. The King had also certain accu-
sations against the priest. Therefore, a se-
cond trial was ordered before the Council of
State, at which the two Grand Inquisitors
were to be present.
It is but proper to say that every endeavor
short of the rack had been made to induce
Pater Domingo to confess where the treas-
ures of Israelites were hid. King Juan hop-
edthatthesecond trialwould elicit something
at least, in regard to this subject.
It was the day of the trial. Ere we enter
the circular apartment in which the council
of State assembled, let us describe a scene
that occurred in the prison oPPater Domin-
go. The count di Almaveda had received
the charge of bringing the priest under a
strong guard to the palace. He had arrived
unusually early, and was now alone in the
low vault with the prisoner.
" The result of this trial can be but one,"

When that new Portuguese congregation
in Amsterdam, whose emigration or flight
we have described in former chapters, many
months after it happened,heard of the death
of Don Lionel Dian, there was shedding of
tears and groanings of sorrow; there was
rending of garments, and mourning on the
floor. . And, in the new synagogue, around
whose holy ark wreathed almond and olive
branches, sweet keepsakes of the Southern
home, there arose in one loud universal voice
the prayer for the dead. Arose in a strain
so sad and sorrowful, arose from every heart
and lip, in tones, as choked by tearspud
sobs, as if each man was mourning his fath-
er. And for long months, the evening breeze
bore at every sunset, the sounds of that
mournful Kadish, far over the Zuider See.
Who knows, but the winds and waves took
up the sad strain and bore it across the
broad ocean to the grave of the Hebrew
Prince.
And, in the stilly hours of eve, dark-eyed
mothers took their wondering little ones up.
on the lap, and told them in a hushed voice
of the great Piinee, the Ben David, who had
done such mighty deeds, and was loved by
the Lord, and told them how he saved the
congregation, and was called to God, and
slept in the golden land far away. And pas.
sionate tears of sorrow rolled down the clear
dark complexioned cheeks as they bid their
children remember him, and endeavor to be-
come like him. And the little ones cried
along, and stammered the name of Don Li-
onel Dian, the great Ben David, and glorious
prince, in holy awe.
And as year by year passed away, and on
the anniversary of their escape, Aaron Ro.
dow chanted joyful Psalms, and the syna.
gogue was decorated with orange and almond
boughs, hearts rejoiced again and again.--
And as on the anniversary of Don Lionel's
death, the mournful Kadish was recited
again, the heart was wrung and the eye dim-l
med at the recollection. And the memory of
the Hebrew Prince was kept fresh and green.

Happily it carried them northward, and eve.
ry howl of the wind, every foaming heave of
the sea, brought them nearer their destina-
tion. Morning dawned; the storm subsid-
ed; the sea grew calm; and the ship with
widespreadsails ploughed her course through
the plunging billows. On the second day
she was rejoined by her companion, the
smaller vessel, which had also managed to
escape, during the storm. Many anxious
fears were relieved by this re-union.
Not long after, anchor was east in the
Zuider See, and the Portuguese Israelites
were landed in Amsterdam. We need. not
say how glad they were to find their children
and treasures there. A congregation was
immediately formed, which still exists at the
present day. Happiness and success smiled
upon them, they grew wealthy and honored,
and enjoyed, in peace, the liberty of eon-
science and divine worship they had sought
for. Holland became their new home, the
country of their children. They prospered
in it, they liked it. Butstill longing glances
were thrown to the south, and fond desires
yearned for the brilliant life in sunny Por-
tugal. Portugal their own first home, the
land they loved for its own sake, for their
own sakes; Portugal was a name that woke
the music in their breasts, the tear in their
eye. Around Portugal, memory wove her
sweetest thoughts, and memory is often the
paradise of life. Oh, and nevermore did
they behold it, nevermore dwelled their eye
on the broad Tagus, and on haughty Gintra,
and on the golden steepled Lisbon. In their
dreams, on the sunset sky, and deep in the
canals of Amsterdam only, they, saw the
bright shadows of the past home and the past
happiness.
We return to the other characters of owr
tale-too long neglected perhaps.
Pater Modestus was imprisoned on charge
of-Misardo's murder. But since nothing
could be proved, he was soon again set -st
liberty. The money found in the house and
upon the body of the miser was, however
confiscated, Poor Modestus, wise through
experience, never again went to sea, but
lived a quiet life, eating and praying in a
well endowed convent of his order.

ed there several weeks. Inquiries were the
order of the day now. Inquiries after old
friends, old places, old things, everything he
could mention, was of interest. Each of the
company seemed to live his youth over again.
Even Donna Bananda began to talk and re-
late of the time when the noblest of the land
sang ditties beneath her windows, and how,
when in Spain with Princess Bianca, the
Duke de Medina Sidonia and the Duke de
Ildefonso were rivals for her affections.
Not long, and the table was set at Good
frow Rosa's order. The supper was brought
in on heavy silver vessels. Old fiery Span-
ish wines were taken from the cellars, and
golden Southern fruits from the greenhouse.
Songs and anecdotes of days long past, bril-
liant reminiseenses and court scandal, spark-
ling wit, and rich humor, were the subjects
of the conversation. All lived again the hap-
piest part of their lives. Any one listening
would have been sure that those present
were of the highest nobility of Spain and
Portugal. Even their children looked at
them with strange astonishment. Thus pas-
sed the evening. And many such evenings
were kept in the Dutch mansion, each one
serving to keep Portugal's memory bright.
We turn to the second scene. On the
coast of India, one of the Portuguese forts
has been attacked and taken by the natives.
As well known the Portuguese were in al-
most constant warfare with the inhabitants
of India. It was at the time when the hate
of the East Indians inflamed by the treach-
erous Venitians, had embittered them most

against the new colonists.  The fort we
speak of was peculiarly obnoxious from the
wild cruelty and oppression of its governor.
Therefore, the rajah of the neighboring
mountains with his warriors had descended
into the plain\and taken the fort. The Por-
tuguese had resisted well, but been forced
to yield to numbers. The Indians slaugh-
tered them mercilessly. But the governor
and his beautiful young wife were brought
prisoners to the rajah. He looked at them
sternly.
"Let me be ransomed," said the governor,
who was no other than Don Miguel di Sousa.
"I offer you great ransom for my life. The
King of Portugal will pay it, rajah."
"So you love life?" inquired the Indian
prince.
" What a question? 1 am your prisoner,
of war, rajah, and, in honor you are bound
to let me be ransomed. Send to the next
Portuguese port with your conditions of my
release."
" The rules of your dishonest nation bind
me not. We have other honor than the -
Portuguese.-
"Rajah, if You harm me, a terrible retri-
bution will follow. Fear the power of Por-
tugall"
"I fear it not. Let this guilty man receive
one hundred- stripes, cut his arins and*go
off, ad then burn his body. ButeA)that
he remain alive as long as possible."
Amid his frantic cries, Don Miguel was
removed from the Rajah's presence; before
sunset the sentence was executed. The ash-
es of his body, together with the cut-off limbs
were cast in a dung hole.
And his wife? His wife, the widow of
Don Isidore di Canaroo, the beautiful Donna
Miranda, was sent by the rajah, as a present
to the Sultan of Hindostan. She elevated
herself, soon afterwards, to the position of
Sultana, and remained his majesty'sbeloved
favorite, as long as he lived. When he died
she ruled by her son, the young sultan, and
always proved herself a decided enemy of"
the Portuguese.

lives of the smaller characters are too unim-
