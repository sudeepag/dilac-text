IT must seem strange, my dear Miss Bilkers, not only to you, but to members of your set, that I should venture to connect the name of such a fashion- able girl as yourself with anything so out of fashion as a dedication, and especially a dedication, what does not pretend to be a pure work      not even a novel with a moral, or a novel with: pur- pose; but simply a tale with a tail, and this tail without sting or venom, and in no ways. distinguish- able except by a few harmless rattles: that can.-burt nothing and nobody. It must seem, I say,' stranhge- perhaps presumptuous-to you and your excellent mother, to whom you owe so much of your early training; but I have a good reason, in my excessive admiration not only of your mind and person, but of your style in general. I have watched you or many occasions with interest, and you must permit me to say, with an ever-growing conviction that there are very few girls in society quite equal to you.    -. iV.        DICATION. It is admitted that the days' of the old-fashioned, cold, hard, and haughty, but quiet, fine-ladyism have passed; and- in its place, we have the active, the aggressive, the impetuously pert and' energetically arrogant style. Of this style, you are, I believe, my dear Miss Bilkers, one of the most happy examples The demonstrative insouciance, if I may be allowed the expression, with whih you twist your lithe figure through the mazes of -the cotillion-the insolent vigor with which you repel the contact of common peo- ple, Hall or party-the active contemptuousness with'which you stare down nobodies as they stroll the piazza of the watering place hotel-or still more that ineffable expression of combative arrogance-that "slap-your-face-for-two-cents" kind of a look-that beams from every feature as you roll along in you carriage through B1llevue Avenue, or the drives in the Park-all, all have often excited my admira- tion, and now fully -warrant this public tribute of regard and esteem from your humble'friend.

Have you ever seen at sea, while watching the dark mass!   to10        NE VER A GAIN waves rolling on in sullen and'resistless power, a handful of spray dashed upwards and icnverted into a shower of dia- monds and rubies by a gleam of sun-light? If so, you have an image of the spoon-drift of society, 'as it sparkled and, flashed -in the lights, natural and artificial, of a lovely even- ing at Baden. The gambling salons were nearly empty. There had been an intermission of an hournor two in the monotonous "faites votre jeu Messieurs; le jeu est fait," of 'the croupiers of the rouge-et-noir, and the game had not yet been opened for the evening. The wheel of the roulette, however, at the head of the large conversation salle was in motion. It ala ways is in motion. It is said that the oldest inhabitants of Baden,--those who have lived through many millions of its revolutions,-have never known it to stop. Friction and the resistance of the air have no effect upon it. On it goes in violation of the plainest principles of mechanics,-in utter contempt of the most rigid demonstrationsi of thP impossi- bility of perpetual motion, on forever and ever-whirling away yearly the wealth, health, and happiness of -thousands. -IWhether its drivers and conductors are a different order of men from the croupiers of the rozge-et-noir is a matter of doubt; but certain it is that they never sleep, and require : othing to eat. There are intermissions with the cards, which indicate a connection between the impassible shufflers and or- dinary humanity; but the ball of the roulette is not less regu- lar and continuous in its revolutions than the balls of the solar system. It was the hour of ebb in the gambling tide,-the time for the minnows and small fry,--the 'single silver-florin folks who have already repocketed their cure-dent, and swal- lowed their pousse-cafes and petits verres. Wait On hour and the big fish will begin to show themselves, the tie will turn, and a flood, with a rush like the bore in the H ogly or the Bay of Funda, will set in and cover the green cloth banks with a sediment of gold. Gathered around the roulette are a dozen or so of couriers, *      A,   NEVER AGAIN.  sos-officiers, and students, with a few ladies' maids and French milliners, together with three or fo r staid, quiet heads of fam- ilies, who, at London or New York), would deem penny points or sixpenny loo the unpardonable sin; and who, if compelled to sit out a night at euchre or vingt-ea-un would require, like Moses at Rephidim, some one to help them hold up their hands. Besides these there is' an English built, clerical-look- ing gentleman in a white. neck cloth, who is intently watching the game with his hand thrust down into his pocket fingering a florin. -Put it down, my dear sir, just for the fun of the thing!---it will be so odd; no one knows you, and you merely wish to see whether Sir will not come up after impair has been calledfive times.   - Far down at the lower end of the large hall one solitary in- dividul was to be seen. The superior attractions of the rou- lette at the upper end, and of the music and crowd without, -had drawn off all stragglers, and left him in undisturbed pos- session of a sofa, and several hundred square feet of solitude. He appeared to be, after making allallowance for a carefully studied toilet, a man of about fifty-five years of age, and was evidently an invalid. His figure was slight and somewhat bent, his complexion pale and unhealthy, his cheeks hollow, his eyes sunken, and his lips bloodless and thin. An enor- mous mustache, dyed a deep black, rested upon the inclined plane of his projecting front teeth, and, contrasting oddly with his scanty gray locks, added an expression of fierceness to a face deeply marked by the play of uncurbed appetites and' passions. Still, there was something-in his appearance that excited interest and commanded respect. An air of exquis- ite refinement and high breeding concealed, at first sight, almost wholly the natural repulsiveness of his expression, and served to confirm a conjecture, warranted by his elaborate and finished, yet quiet, style of dress, that he was a man of high social position, if not of rank. A practised observer might, perhaps, have gone still further and have marked him down as an aristocratic roud; old before his time, and bowed with the weight, not of years, but of days ad nights of vice and folly. ' *    t*   12      . , NEVER A GAIN. He'was reclining upon the sofa-in an attitude of affected ease, fat but poorly concealed a sense of debility and lassi- tude. 41e appeared to b'e lost in thought of no very pleasant kind, toijutdge from the frown )on his brow, and the impatient gnawing of his thin lip. But of whatever character his reve. rie, he was rotised from'it by a servant in atplain suit of black who, with a letter in his hands, had been peering aboul through the different rooms. The reclining gentleman took the letter wivth a listless air glanced carelessly at the address, and suddenly started -fronr his recumbent attitude, with a gesture of vexation, and a fce muttered objurgations in French.     o "Has any one seen this?" he demanded of the man. "No one, Durchlaucht. I have just taken it from the post. I thought it best to- bring it to you at once withou waiting your Excellency's returnAto the hotel." , "'Tis very well, Steignitz. I am glad that no one has sees this address. But you forget that I have forbidden you t style me Excellency or' ueurchaucht. Recollect that I ant plain Monsieur D'Okenheim." "Permit me to observe," replied Steignitz, " that I se here almost fifty people who know us." "True! I am not such a fool as to think that an incog nito can be preserved at Baden. But fifty people'are no everybody. I have my reasons for being MonsieurYtkf heim to all strangers. Where is Madame?" "Der Herr will find her outside, directly in front of thi lower window." "Alone?" "No, she is attended by Herrn Ledgeral." Herr D'Okenhejm's face was a study-the expression wa so peculiar,- and so complex. p A deep frown corrugated hi forehead, and-his shaggy eyebrows were drawn down so a to almost conceal- the pinkish, lustreless eyes they shaded while his heavy mustache was thrown upwards, and the corr ers of his mouth twisted into a smile of mingled malice an pleasure.   N VEER A GAIN.     ,    j -He waved his hand. Steignitz bowed and deputed tc rejoin Annette, Madame, D'Okenheim's French maid, whc was awaiting him for a stroll in the avenue of Lichtenthal. ' Monsieur D'Okenheim, with a trembling hand, broke the s al of his letter, and began to read. As he read, his frown grew deeper, and what there had been of a smile, gave place to an expression of pure rage. Hecrushed the letter in his hand, and, starting from his seat, paced up and down with vivaciqus, but uncertain step. Approaching the window, indicated by his servant, he looked out upon the crowd. His eye lighted at once upon a gentleman and lady seated directly below him, and again his face was illumined with an equivocal smile. He stood gdzing at them for some time, one hand crumpling the letter-the other nervously twisting the ends of his long mustache. "All alike!-yes, all alike!" he exclaimed. "I realD had begun to believe that there were exceptions, and that my wife would prove one of them; but I am rather glad to be undeceived. I am rather glad at being relieved from the distinction of possessing such a rara avis as a virtuous wife. ; "Virtue!" he muttered, renewing his walk.  "Bah what is virtue?  I don't believe a word of it-in man or woman. It is a hybrid-a monster-an unnatural affirmative born of the conjunction of two negatives-no passions and nc opportunities. Opportunities and importunities have nol been wanting in her case. She has been too long the corn panion of the Princess of Stacklenberg for that. It mus have been her cold heart that has kept her reputation so fa: clear of stain. I had begun to think that it was her clever ness-that, as Shakespeare has'it, she ever "put out the fir( of passion with the sap of reason." But cleverness neve: saves them. The sap of reason dries up when most needed But why has the fire, in her case, never been lighted?-that'; what puzzles me. There was the Count Hunoyd!--ithough at one time it might be my duty to put a sword through -th( handsomest man in Vienna; but no, she extinguished hin   "        NE VER AG6AIN. herself without the slightest suggestion from me. And nov --well, as the wisest of all poets says: "'In some breasts passion lies concealed and silent, Like war's swart powder in a castle vault, Until occasion like the lintstock lights it.' Perhaps the Yankee carries the lintstock. "Strange! strange!" he continued, advancing to the window, and looking out upon his wife and her companion. "It must be just the perversity of the sex. Were I a doting, uxorious, jealous husband, my wife; I do not doubt, would have counted her lovers by the score; and now this Yankee is the first man in w hom she has taken any real interest. I should not have thought that the self-conceited gauky could have stirred that smooth-polished, well-balanced mechanism she calls her heart. However, I must tell her of this letter. It will distress her, I know; but then she knows how and where to seek for consolation." Monsieur D'Okenheim seized his hat and stick, and, with an affected jauntiness of step, sallied from the l-Turhaus. Threading his way, not without difficulty, through the crowd, he advanced to -the couple whose movements he had been watching. The lady-Madame    D'Okenheim--was a distinguished looking woman of about eight-and-twenty years of age. She had a fine, stylish figure, almost perfect, unless perhaps an imperfection might be found in a decided promise of fat at forty; and she had a face which, if not unqualifiedly hand- some, had a  great deal of that kind of beauty which is the exponent of youth and high health-large liquid lustrous eyes, as yet undimmed by gas-light and'ball-room glare--skin p1ure and polished, as yet untinted and unroughened by matutinal champagne and pat de foie gra--pearly teeth, and ruby lips that spoke only of sound lungs, and a good digestion, and said nothing about a compressed liver, and an obstructed portal circulation. Not the highest style of beauty it may be. Not perhaps beauty at all; but the-highest condition of'   NErVER AGAIN.          15 beauty,-the sine fua non of beauty,-the something without which beauty, unless in some rare cases, don't amount to much; or, to mount a metaphor, the animal on which spiritual and intellectual beauty--the beauty of soul and mind-gallops through the avehues of sense into the heart. Of course if the animal is out of condition, beauty can't ride fast or far. She is-very apt to stop short of the portals of passibn, and "hitch up " at the door of respect and esteem. Let it not be supposed from this figurative flourish, that Madame D'Oken- heim was deficient in the beauty of expression. All that is meant is that she was healthily handsome. A charming toilet set off all the graces of her person to the best advan- tage, while the effect was very much heightened by an easy but quiet graciousness of manner, and a certain aura of bon ton which she seemed to breathe out at every word and move- ment.  Her style clearly indicated study in the Viennese school, which is to manners pretty much wh hile Venetian school was to art-a happy mingling of vivacity and repose in the composition, with the flesh tints strong and hearty; the general tone rich and warm, with a very faithful and substan- tial rendering of sentiment and passion. Her' companion was, perhaps, 'twenty-three years of age. He, 'too, was rather good looking. Tall, and somewhat lanky in figure, but withal graceful and easy in his bearing, there was perhaps a littletoo much of an attempt. at elegance in his general getting up-the necessary and pardonable effect of his recent emancipation from certain puritanic -prej- udices, as well as from a certain provincialism in dress, which. at that time still characterized the great commercial metropolis of America, but which has now so happily disap- peared. The eldest son of Mr. Ledgeral,-a reputable New York merchant,-he had been dispatched to  Liverpool, a few months before, for the settlement of some business question, requiring a confidential agent on the part of Ledgeral, Ship- pen and Co. His business having been satisfactorily arranged, young Ledgeral was now enjoying, preparatory to his return   16        'NEVER AGA IN to the dingy counting-house in Burling Slip, a few months' run upon the continent. It was at Frankfort that he first made the acquaintance of Monsieur and Madame D'Okenheim. He was trying to make himself understood by the custodd of the Wahlzimmer, or election chamber of the German Emperors, but inasmuch as he knew not a word of German, and but very little French, he was turning away with a feeling of profound disgust at the fellow's stupidity, when a pleasant voice came to his relief with a "Permit me-I will explain," and Madame D'Oken- heim, in alternate English and German, cleared up all diffi- culties. Monsieur D'Okenheim coming up, and he, too, speak- ing English, the. conversation was continued. Together they saw the famous Golden Bull, or Deed, by which Charles IV. settled the mode of election of the German Emperors, and visited the Kaisersaal, or banqueting-room, where the Em- perors were waited upon by Kings arid Princes. Again they met, bowed, and spoke, in the- 7yudengasse, one of the chief sights in Frankfort, and at dinner-time, as luck would have it, Mr. Ledgeral found himself at the tableJd'hote the vis-a-vis of Madame. Upon his expressing a wish to visit Homburg, a seat in Monsieur D'Okenheim's carriage, for next day, was offered him, and as Madame backed the invitation with a bewitching smile, and an assurance that she should be charmed to have his company, it was most gratefully accepted. Every traveller,knows how rapidly an acquaintanceship ripens under such circumstances: one sight-seeing excursion having about as much forcing power as a round of dinner or evening parties and a dozen or two of morning calls. It is not surprising therefore, that during the ride to Homburg it -hould have been found that Baden-Baden was the destina- tion of all parties, and that there was again a seat for Mr. Ledgeral in Monsieur D'Okenheim's travelling carriage. There was a freshness of feeling and expression about the young man that interested Madame D'Okenheim, who, accustomed since extreme youth to the polished and doubly   NEVER A GAIN.  refined, but heartless, and dissipated society of mediatized German Princes, and the haute noblesse of Austria aid Hun*- gary, was thoroughly blase. His occidentalities had for her the charm of novelty. They affected her taste very much as the flavor of a canvas-back duck does the palate of an Euro- pean epicure,-as a something dubiously delightful. There was also aCertain degree of mingled verdancy and shrewdness-a kind of Yankee naivete--mixed with a good proportion of self conceit, that seemed for a time to amuse Monsieur D'Okenheim, who soon managed, with the skill of a diplomatist and man of the world, by a few adroit observa- tions and questions to strip'the vain and confident youth of every feeling, sentiment, and plan, leaving his inner man in a state of nudity which, had he been conscious of, he him- self would have been the first to denounce as ridiculous and indecent, especially as with all his "'cuteness," he got not a I ag of Monsieur D'Okenheim's mental habiliments in return. The process complete, Monsieur took, apparently, but little further interest in his conversation; most of the time, while in the carriage, he seemed to be asleep, or, when stopping to view a ruin or a landscape, was so apathetic and indif- ferent, so indisposed or unfit for exertion, or so attentive to Annette, the French maid, or so taken up with the talk of guides and custodes, that the duty of attendance upon Madame fell naturally and wholly to the young man. The approach of Monsieur DIOkenheim, as he picked. his way amid the crowd seated under the colonnade of the Kur- haus, was unnoticed by the lady or her companion until he stood before them. A slight start and a suffusion of the cheek in both were not unobserved by him, but produced no perceptible effect upon his manner, unless perhaps to increase the sinister smile with which he addressed them. Raising his hat and bowing low, he said, in a tone of bland impres- siveness: "I am sorry to interrupt your conversation, and I ask a thousand pardons, but, Monsieur Ledgeral, if you will have the goodness to excuse Madame for ten minutes, I have a few words to say to her. I have just received a- letter, the    x8         NE VER A GAIN. contents of which I wish to communicate to her. I shall detain her but a few minutes, when, Monsieur, if you will have the goodness to take charge of her again,--that is, if you are not otherwise engaged,-you will, I am sure, 'charm her and oblige me." Madame D'Okenheim rose from her seat. "Shall we find you here upon our return?" she demanded, looking back with an inviting smile. The young man, blushing and bowing, laid his hand upon his heart with theatric, but not ungraceful, gallantry. "I am a statue," he said, ' until your return." "As stationary, perhaps?" she replied, smiling. r "Certainly. But I would not have you think as hard or as cold. The great English poet cf wham we were talking, says I the eyes of women are Promethean fires.' I have been Prometheusized; my heart has been touched by the heavenly flame, and although I shall. not move, I shall live, and feel, and hope."  "We shall not keep you lon  waiting," exclaimed Mon- sieur D'Okenheim, who affected not to hear these remarks, which, uttered in a low tone, had nevertheless too much of the penetrating intensity of passion to wholly escape his ear. "I am anxious to resume my beat 'at the table within. I feel that I shall be in luck to-night." Madame took her husband's proffered arm. A few steps brought them to the deserted piazza of the Trinkhalle. Mon- sieur looked cautiously around to see that no one was within: hearing. "So" he exclaimed, pursing up his lips and ejecting the sound with a prolonged hissing through his closed teeth. to ma belle, the Yankee's gallantry is improving, I see." "Yes, he is coming on," replied the lady carelessly. "He begins to fancy himself a gallant, depremiereforce, and to plume himself upon his conquest." CA conquest! Yes, after the fashion of the soldier who captured the Tartar.; A real Cadmian victory! You have heard the phrase--' a victory of Pyrrhus'? 'Another such - ,li , D* .,-      i     , '   NE VER AGAIN.      -    Ig success,' said the old king of Epirus, 'and I am ruined':. in fact the conquering jackanape is completely in your power now ; you could make him hang himself with one of your garters." "I have no wish that my garters should be put to such a use!"  's "No? Perhaps you prefer that he should go on conquer- ing and to conquer: may-be he is nearer a conquest of your heart than I supposed. Come, tell me what progress he has really made. Has he reached his third parallel? has he crowned the crest of the -glacis?-is the citadel in danger?" "I don't understand "barrack-roogn figures," replied the lady, contemptuously. "To be plain then, what do you really think of this lover of yours? You know you can trust me. It is a great thing for a woman to be able to trust her husband in such matters. Come, tell me, is your own heart wholly untouched?" The struggle between a ler and a sneer, for possession of the speaker's countenance, would have made a study for the great'illustrator of Faust. "Well, perhaps not,' replied Madame D'Okenheim mu- singly. "He is good looking,     and his American conceit and naivete amuses me. Besides, he is so enterprising. Why, the fellow would 'have no hesitation, if he had a chance, despite his bashfulness, in making love to an Empress. That inter- ests me, but you have no objections, have you? You know you have given me carteblanche." "True; but hitherto you have not seemed disposed to take advantage of your privileges. Do you know the reasons that I have had for being so liberal?"  "Because perversity is about the only quality in woman that you believe in, and you thought that removing all restric- tions would remove nine-tenths of the temptation." "Partly so, ma belle." "And because, although you had but little respect for my principles, you had for my will, and you knew that any restrictionshyou could impose would be useless." "Partly so, ma belle."   20         NEIVER AGAIN. "And because you wished to secure for yourself aiimilar privilege.'  "What a profound analyst! My dear, motives are fre- quently, and, in my case, always, confused and complicated. When I want to know what I mean myself, I shall in future come to you." "You flatter me." "Not at all; but I am going to mention one other reason which is somewhat complimentary, and which you have left out--and that is great confidence in your prudent manage- ment of any case that- might arise. Mind you, I don't claim' any right to interfere with you, upon general marital princi- ples, but in case of' any public scandal it might become my duty, you know, to send a pistol ball through the gentleman's head. Now I don't like that; I have done it, perhaps, half-a- dozen times too often already. To be Sure, the temptation to add an American to the list might be something," said Herr D'Okenheim musingly. "But to quit this pleasant subject, and come to something downright disagreeable ahd more nearly affecting my feelings." Monsieur D'Okenheim paused as if taking time to mas- ter some rising emotion, and for a moment his mustache worked rapidly up and down the inclined plane of his teeth. "I have just received a letter from my good cousin," he at length said in a low, hissing tone. "Here it is, and what think you?--a fresh insult! He says that he has heard fromn Isenthal, and, as presumptive heir to the estates, he must object .to my cutting more than a hundred klafters of wood for the use of the castle, and that he forbids my damming the river and converting meadow-land into ornamental lake and fish-pond, He even alludes to my failing health, and his certain prospects of the succession, and signs himself my loving cousin, Joseph. The cold blooded, canting rascal! Ah I how I have ever hated him; how I do hate him! and what's more, how he hates me, and you too, ma belle! In fact, I am not sure but that a good deal of the feeling he has for me, is a reflection of the intense hate he has for you."    NE VER AGAIN.          2 T "There is no love lost between us," replied the lady. "True, but he has the advantage of you in this-he may yet have it in his power to make you feel how little he loves you. He lords it now in a bold tone; but what will he do, think you, when he succeeds to my estates?" "You may well outlive him," said Madame D'Okenheim, with a slight shrug of the shoulders. "Pshaw!" replied Monsieur D'Okenheim in an impatient tone, " his life is worth at dozen such as mine. But if I die within the year I don't think I could rest in my grave were he my successor. I'd sooner see the vilest beggar's brat in my place."              -  "And I should have very little rest out of the grave, I suppose," said Madame, "but I don't see how you can help it. You cannot be more sorry than I am that your hopes of an heir have been doomed to disappointment." "But they must not be disappointed," returned Monsieur D'Okenheim. The lady started, and looked up inquiringly. "So! A leaf from the history of Napoleou; and I am to play the role of Josephine! Ha!" "Not so, ma belle; you mistake me entirely. I have not the least hopes from anything of that kind." The lady shrugged her shoulders. "Oh! don't think, Madame, that I intend to reproach you. I know better than that. I know that were we on trial for  the crime,--for criine it is, or if not a crime, something which we have but to search the annals of the reigning houses of Germany to find has been punished far m/ore severely than a crime,-if we were on trial, I say, for the crime of not giving a lot of little hostages to fortune, and citizens to the State, your sentence would be light. I know full well that you might, if it pleased you, emulate the famous English Lady 'Godiva, and ride in a similar toilet through the Pays Latin or the Alser Vorstadt, without a single straggling pathologist being able to raise his finger at you. But, my dear, did you never hear of quietly adopting an heir--of lifting some   2*         NEEVER AGA IN.  wayside waif into high esta e-of buying some infantile re. sponsibility, eradicating the wooden spoon to which it- was born, and sticking a silver fork in its place?" "I have read of such things in romances."  "And I have known of such things in real life." "And you would try it?" "No, no! I would never try it," and the Count empha- sized the "I " with peculiar force. "I would never run the risk of inevitable exposure which always comes of men's bungling in such matters. The thing has been done, and in probably a good many cases the succession has been diverted by the expedient. But I am afraid the difficulties in our case are almost insuperable, unless in the hands of an exceed- ingly cautious and clever woman. I could, of course, have nothing to do with it. I merely mentioned it to show that there are more ways than one of tying a knot in the Devil's tail." Herr Okenheim pressed the point of his finger upon the round shoulder of Madame, and leered into her face with a grotesque grin. "That is, you would like to have the knot tied without your running any risk from, his hoof or his horns; or in other words, if any one is to be tried for attempting to foist a false heir into Isenthal, you"would rather it should be your wife than yourself." "Hush, my dear. Don't speak of such a thing. I had no such thought. I only meant that supposing such a wicked and foolish thing were attempted, it would certainly fail if it were not managed so that even I could have no suspicion of it." "And you propose that I should undertake a scheme so liable to failure?" demanded the lady. "Ptopose? Oh no! It would be wrong, absurd, dan- gerous! Consult Annette, and see what can be done; she is devoted to you; she can 'be trusted. I propose nothing. I plan nothing. I have lost all confidence in plans. I, have seen them so often thwarted; as for instance in our mar-   rEYi VER AGAINI.       , expectations of cousin Joseph. I mean no disparagement to your wit, or beauty, or style. "Ah! what a misfortune then is mine,-the more unbear- able, too, since I am so moderate in my wishes. All that I desire is an heir, and almost anything alive and human would content me. All people desire children, but then they desire prodigies,-but I don't. They desire 'living jewels dropped from heaven,' as the poet has it, but then they want them of the clearest water. Now H shouldn't mind a little im- perfection. For instance, I should not mind if my heir looked like the coarsest peasant's child. I don't care about beauty. A moderate amount of uglines's-anything short of a chim- panzee or a Cape Baboon-I should not object to. Strength and health! Yes, I should want our heir to have strength and health that he might outlive that amiable cousin of mine ; but nothing else should I care about. I don't demand sense, or talents; still less, genius,. I have no improper and selfish longings for a wise child.". "A wise child!" exclaimed Madame D'Okenheim. "What do you mean by a wise child?" "That depends, my dear, upon what may be considered evidences of wisdom. Pico- delta Mirandola, Blaise Pascal, and others, gave evidences of a certain kind of wisdom at a very early age. Onattle other hand, there is a proverb relat- ing to a different kind of wisdom. Pardon the implied re- flection upon your sex, but you must have often heard it,-it, is found in all languages. The, Italians say, ' II mnggior ser- zizio che possa fare un figliuolo saggio al padre c 'l conascerlo.' The French say, ' I1 est savanlt l'enfant dui connait son propre pere.' The English say, 'It is a wise child that'- Well, you know the proverb. I should not care if my successor was still more ignorant, and didn't know his own mother." "Infamous!" exclaimed Madame D'Okenheim, starting back, and shaking off her husband's hand from her shoulder. "Infamous, indeed. Nine-tenths of all the proverbs in all languages relating to youi sex are infamous, scandalous, and, if you please, absurd; but I am not responsible' for   24 N^ EVER AGAIN. them, and I must beg you to lay aside all affectation. little, just -a little, indignation at the aphoristic impertinence have quoted; may be perhaps becoming; at least, it might were anybody by but ourselves. But between us-- Bah! know each other-don't we, ma belle?  "I think we do," replied the lady, with a shrug. "( least I think I know you." t' Certainly you do, but that is not much. It is not di cult to know such an honest, open-hearted fellow as I a But I give you credit for a higher knowledge than that." "Pardon -me, returned the lady, a perceptible sno marking the expression of her countenance. "A hig] knowledge? Yes, perhaps; but not a more difficult." ;Well, well, ma belle; atyleast you have a knowle( of your own interests. You know that it will never do make an esclandre that would bring your name before t public just at this tilme." The gentleman and lady took a few turns up and down t piazza in silence. They paused as if to listen to those do clous strains, those nectared and subtle voicings of an exq site and intensified conventionality that floated on the gold and odorous air across the esplanade ; but little was the n si)c heeded by either. Tlle gentleman was the first to spe: - "You will see thpn, my dear, that under the circu stances it is best to avoid all scandal with that young Am ican. I should be very sorry to have to shoot him; it woi - make so much noise. Not that I wish to interfere with a flirtation of yours, however far you may be willing to push but publicity would be very objectionable; and I think perceive that you are becoming a little careless. That is ways the case with you women when once you become res interested. But there is no danger of a grand passion in t case, is there? It would be too ridiculous, eh?"  The lady made no reply.

It will be very easy in a few days to shake him off. He leaves for his own country in a short time." The lady turned inquiringly to her husband. "He is not rich," replied Monsieur emphatically, nodding his head, 'f and once across the Atlantic, and settled down to Ihis business, it'will be long before he will visit Europe again. lThe money-getting devil will get hold of him. I know some. thing of those New York merchants. I have visited them, when I was attached to our legation at Washingtoln, in their own houses-quite magnificent their houses are too,-regu- lar temples-dedicated solely to the worship of mammon,- all fitted up exactly alike with the gorgeous fragments and figments of a bought-and-paid-for taste,-while the service consists mainly of the chinking of gold and the rattling of dollars. They have a creed, and a catechism too. The one begins with, ' I believe in any man worth a million,' and the other with, 'What is the chief end of mana?-To glorify trade and make money forever.' No, we shall never hear of him again, and, as he suspects not our title or address, he prob- ably will never hear of us. If we parted from him now, I don't believe he could hunt us up, even if he had time and disposition to do so. "As you remarked," observed Monsieur D'Okenheim, after a pause, "he is good-looking." "Passably so." "And well mannered?" "So, so."  "And deeply enamored of you." "Perhaps. You have had more experience in such mat- ters, and are a better judge than I am." "Ah, Madame, you flatter me, and belie your own acute- ness. What is the acquired skill of man in that respect com- pared to the natural instinct of woman? I never knew this to fail, except in cases where they suffer their own passions to  blind them. I hope, for the credit of one of the coolest heads, 2   sf    26        AT EVER AGAIN.. I know, that interest in him does not disqualify you from esti- mating the colresponding symptoms of interest on his part ." "Well, well," exclaimed the lady impatiently, " perhaps it is, so,--and what then?" "What then?" said Monsieur- D'Okenheim, tvisting up the corners of his mustache, and drawing down his eyebrows until the two, almost touching, made a circlg of hair through which peered his pinched-up nose. "What then? Why noth. ing--nothing at all. Only I would remark that women of the world are often so confoundedly grateful for a modicum of genuine youthful devotion, that they suffer themselves so be carried beyond their depth before they know it: Mind you, I don't pretend to any right to interfere, but this little affair-' that is, if you are determined to make it an affair-is so odd, so unexpected, and, I may add, so inoportune, that I can't refrain from speaking to you about it. - "Don't you think, my dearl; that it would be a great want of tact, and sense, and wisdom, in a woman as clever as you are, not to avail herself of one of the best qualities in her lover?" The lady turned a sharp look of inquiry towards her hus- band. "You recollect what your friend the Princess of Stackiin- burg used to say: that she chose for her lovers only young officers of the Alie-regimenter, because, they being constantly liable to marching orders, she was certain of getting rid of them more easily than of'the gallants of the Xaiserliche Ieibwache, who are always around the court. Ah! the Prin- cess was a great woman and a wise woman. She knew that nine-tenths of scandal comes from the unnecessary vigor with which many women defend their hearts from all ap- proaches. 'It isn't the assault and capture of a city,' said she, 'that makes the fame of a siege: it is the mining and countermining; the boom of the batteries and the prelimi- nary fails 'armes. If a woman   demands for  her heart a systematic attack with a heavy siege train, she can't be sur- prised if rumor sooner or later sticks her into one of her bul.   N EVER AGAIN.         2 Ir/ins scandaleux.' Now, in a court where the characters of so many women are compromised, the reputation of the Prin- cess of Stacklinburg is almost intact. 'It is such a nice thing,' said the Princess one day to me, to be able to get rid of one's lo rs before one is tired of them;--most women wait too long. Now'don't you think that in view of the ex- ceedingly delicate management that may be required in a cer- tain case, you have amused yourself with this young man about long enough? Don't you think that we had better 'drop- him at once? It won't be much of a sacrifice--will 't, -ny dear? and besides, he will be compelled in a few days to drop us -that is, unless you make a slave of hbll, and tie him to your chariot wheels forever. I don't dou your power to do so, but it strikes me-mind I have no intention to dictate, hardly even to advise-that in the end le jeu ne vant pas la chandelle, or in his own shop-keeping lingo, the thing would not pay. But come, ma belle, let us cross to the rKurhaus. Your Yankee will hardly wait much longer, and I am anxious to pick up a thousand louis this evening. I feel certain that I shall win. Fortune, I am sure, owes me a good turn, after this last insult from my precious cousin." The lady made no reply, but sauntered slowly by the side of her husband back to the colonnade of the Kzrhaus, where Mr. Ledgeral' was impatiently gnawing the head of his cane, and nervously twisting himself about on two chairs, as if to convince any sedentarily-disposed and seat-seeking spectator that the second chair was an optical illusion. "We have made you wait a" long time," said Monsieur D'Okenheim, with his politest bow. "The time has seemed long, it is true," replied Mr. Ledg- eral, with a significant smile to the lady, "but no time would be too long to wait in the service of Madame." "Ah, very well said--very well turned indeed. But then a turn for compliments is characteristic of the Yankees. They are very complimentary-to themselves," he muttered aside to Madame; " but are you sure you have no other engagements?" "None whatever."  rL    /  '   -       - ,  I,*  28       NAE VER AGAIN. "Madame will then be indebted to you." With an abstracted air, the lady took the arm'of the young man., They followed Monsieur D'Okenheim into the gam- bling saloon, and stood behind him as he dropped into his accustomed seat, marked by his card pinned to the green cloth, and pushed out ten louis to the centre of the table, "Rouge gagne, noir peridt" exclaimed the dealer; and a croupier added ten louis to the stake. A second time the phrase was repeated, and twenty louis were added. A third, a fourth, and a fifth time, still Mon- sieur D'Okenheim sat motionless and silent. "Deux louis d la masse," he suddenly exclaimed, as the dealer prepared for the sixth deal. "aDeux louis d la masse," repeated the dealer. NVoir gagne, rougej erd." "Ah, qguelle chance etonnante! quel bonheur merveilleux!" murmured the galerie. The croupier picked out two pieces from the glittering pile of three hundred and twenty louis, while Monsieur D'Oken- heim reached forward, and pulled the remainder towards him. He looked up to his wife with a smile that was half a grin and half a sneer. "Do you see, ma belle," he whispered, "the cards are favorable, but one must play with reticence and self-control. There is no use in pushing fortune too far. To draw back in time one must draw back early." Mr. Ledgeral and the lady sauntered into the open air. The full moon had just risen over the eastern rim of the basin of Baden-the last faint flush of sunset still tinged the tottering towers of das alkt Schloss. Slowly they paced around the esplanade-through the alley of shops-up and down the avenue of Lichtenthal--by the banks of the Oos-along the fagade of the Trinkhall,- until, quite accidentally, they took a turn into the now deserted walks on the hill-side, back of the Kurhauzs. A moment after, Annette, the lady's maid, accompanied ly Steignitz, entered the same path, and stealthily followed -Ge steps of her mistress.   CHAPTER II. La1le Mahopac-A Bear or a Bald Eagle?--A Queer Boy-Biblical Exegesis-A Visit to the Hudson--First Love-An Awful Blunder -Poetry and Despair. GO up the Hudson as far as the town of Peekskill, and thence directly back from the river some twelve or fourteen miles, and you will arrive at the shore of one of a group of little lakes, six or seven in number, which there lie nestling in :he embraces of the Highlands. Elevated a thousand feet' above the level of the river--fed with water from the clearest springs--swept by the purest mountain breezes-and studded with little islets of mingled rock and wood--nothing can be imagined of a more happy, healthful beauty. From  one high hill the whole group-at certain seasons when the foliage does not prevent--may be seen at once, like ornaments of silver on the green and brown : - garniture of the landscape; and, from the branches of one tall tree crowning this hill, can be traced the distant valley of the Hudson. It was on a day some nineteen or twenty years after the date of the conversation recorded i;the last chapter, that two men, in a one-horse vehicle yclept a " buggy," were driv- ing slowly along the road that winds around the foot of this hill. Their attention had been attracted to a dark-looking object perched in the leafless branches of the tall tree on its summit, and they stopped their horse to examine it more steadily. "I can't rightly think exactly what kind of a critter that may be," said the elder of the two; "that is, if it is a living critter at all. What do you think, Captain Combings?"   30 N3E VE R         AGA IN. "Well, Deacon, I think it is an animal of some kind, for I can distinctly see it move," replied the Captain, a short, stout, ruddy-faced man of about forty-five years of age. "It can't be a crow?" "Oh, no!" exclaimed the Deacon. "It ain't nothin' like a crow. My eyes ain't so good as they used to be, jlLey are good enough to see that that is too big, and no black enough, for a crow. It may be a bald eagle." ' Perhaps it's a bear!" suggested Captain Combings. "Well, it does look something like a, bear, that's a fact; but I've lived within three miles of this hill now for about seventy years, and I have never seen a bear except in a travelling menagerie. 'Tain't a bear, I guess; but here comes a fellow that can tell us, perhaps. Hollo, there! -Mister! do you know wha- that thing is up in the top of that tree there?" The question was asked of a man with an axe on his shoulder, who was- just emerging from the bushes -that con- cealed-a wood-road running up the hill-side. The woodman thus addressed deliberately slipped on his jacket which he carried on his arm, advanced to the side of the buggy, and, resting his hand, upon his axe helve, squinted up to the object in question.' "You want to know what kind of a wild thing that is up there in the tree," said he, with a chuckling laugh. "Yes," responded the Deacon: "Captain Combings here thinks it a bear, but I 'spect the Captain knows more about whales and porpoises than he does about bears. I kind o' consate it's bald eagle." "'Tisn't an eagle," replied the man. "It can't be a&bear," said the Deacon. v "No, nor a  lion, nor a tiger, nor a rhinoceros-it's a boy!" "Whew! A boy! Why, what is he doing up there? We saw him, two miles back, and have been watching him here for some time past. He must have been perched up there for an hour, at least. Are you sure it's a boy?"  NE VLER AE 4 GAINr. "Sartin sure; it is little Luth Lansdale.!He roosts up there purty much all his spare time now. What he does up there, I can't exactly make out. I've seen boys climb trees for nuts and birds' nests, and 'taint long since I used to do it myself, but there ain't a nut or, nest on that tree. A queer boy, Luth! Sometimes I think he's a little non comros, and sometimes I think he ain't. I axed him one day what he had taken to roosting in that tree for, and he said he went up there to see the world and the kingdoms thereof." "Just like his father," exclaimed the Deacon; "he was always a queer man-a terrible queer man." "You know this youngster, then?" demanded Captain Combings. "What kind of a boy is he?" "Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know much about him. I've heard tell all kind of opinions-some say he's smart, and some say he's stupid; some say he's a very good boy, and others say he's a regular imp. I don't know what to say myself, but I'm afraid he won't turn out very well. I've had the teachers in our Sunday-school complain to me that he, asked such odd questions that they were quite dis- gusted with him. But there, he's coming down now. Get up, pony!" "Hold on for a moment," exclaimed Captain Combings, with an expression of interest. "I think I once knew his father, and his mother, too, for that matter. I would like to see him a little closer. .He's coming this way." The Deacon checked his horse again, and the two sat quietly observing the movements of the youngster as he slipped down the trunk of the tree and, touching the ground, bounded off on a run down the hill. "A very queer boy," muttered the Deacon. The Deacon's phrase expressed exactly the reputation that the lad had contrived to establish for himself throughout the community. However much his friends and companions might differ in their estimation of his talents, temper, or man- ners, they all agreed that he was "queer, very queer." For his age, which migfht be about fourteen years, he was i     .l    32        ,EVEA'R AGAIN. perhaps as active and vigorous a youth as Putnam County could boast. His growth had been rapid, but healthy. In person he was tall and somewhat slender, but strong-limbed and supple. His features, though tolerably regular, could hardly be called handsome, with the exception of his eyes, which were large and of a deep brown- color; but his face had nuch of a certain kind of beauty--the kind which comes up, as it were, from the depths of the soul, where it lies hidden, in response only to kind and sympathetic observation-a beauty something like that often seen in the road-side pool- a passing glance, and all is dark, stagnant, and forbidding- a second look, and, lo! in the depths are flitting clouds, and leafy trees, and waving grass and flowers. A something wayward and capricious in manner had, per- haps, more than anything else contributed to his reputation for queerness. Ordinarily quiet and reserved, he could be, at times, when high animal spirits broke down the barriers of bashfulness, rampantly gay and communicative, but in all cases a vivid imagination and great natural delicacy of feeling exerted a modifying influence. For neither of these qualities, however, had he found much that was encouraging or conge- nial among his usual associates. At home, life had for him only discomfort and vexations,; abroad, he hatcompanions and acquaintances, but no intimacies or warm friendships. His nature had thus been turned back and driven in upon itself, and his sympathies; cut off in a measure from the light of actual life, and cellared in the depths of his own mind, were rapidly running themselves out into the world beyond through the loop-holes of imagination. Sensitive and shrink- ing, yet ardent and self-reliant, he had ever evinced an instinctive aversion tp the sordid and vulgar surr dlings of his daily life, and hij passionate love for the companionship of his own thought/had unconsciously driven him frequently to the hill-top as tte best escape he could make from his daily cares and troubles, and as a kind of ascent, as it were, into a higher life demanded by the dawning capabilities of his nature. There, perched on the topmost boughs of his favor-   NE VER AGAIN.          33 3 3 ite tree, he would remain sometimes for hours gazing down into the fascinating little lakes, or straining his eyes to the distant Hudson-the mysterious object of his intense long- ings-type to him of the World, of Life-avenue to his future-the only channel through which his imagination went out to fame, fortune, and power. No Hindoo ever longed more earnestly for a bath in the sacred Ganges, or Christian pilgrim for a sight of the blessed Jordan, than did he for a nearer view of the Hudson. The youth dashed down the hill in a succession of rugs and jumps, and, plunging through the bushes at the bottom, leaped the dilapidated rail-fence, and alighted in the road not far from where the buggy, with its occupants, was standing. "Luther!" exclaimed the Deacon-and the youth advan- ced inquiringly. "Luther Lansdale, your name is, isn't it?" "Yes, sir." "And do you know what my name is?" "Oh, yes sir; everybody knows Deacon Dusenbury." "Right, Luther; I 'spect I'm pretty well known about here. And how is your mother, Luther? Pretty well, eh? Well, I'm glad to hear it; and your brother John--well too, eh? The fact is, Captain Combings, everybody is always well up here, no fever and ague, nor nothing. 'Tis the healthiest country about here, I ever see. And now, Luther, I want to know what you were doing up in that tree, making us think it was a bear, or a bald eagle?" The boy hesitated for a moment, and then, with a lurking twinkle of his eye, he said: "There is nothing in the Bible against climbing trees, is there?" "W hy no," replied the Deacon musingly, "I believe not. I don't think the Scripter has much to say about climbing trees, either agin it or for it." "Oh, yes sir; there is something in favor of it." "How so, Luther? What does it say? I recollect there is something about the tree of Life, and the tree of knowl- edge, and there's the olive tree and the sycamore tree,--and    \ 34         NEyVER AGAIN. 34         NE VER AGAIN. our Saviour talks about the fig tree,--and David says some. where, 'wake harp and p-saltree.' Now I don't know what kind of a tree a p-saltree is, but I guess there is nothing about climbing it. I don't believe you can find anything about climbing any kind of a tree in the Bible." "Ohi yes sir 5 don't the Bible say-' and Zaccheus, he did climb tie tree, his Lord to see'?" "Right, Luther; it does say so. I see your Sunday school. ing has done you good." Captain Combings, laughed heartily, and gave the young- ster a knowing look, as -much as to say that, despite his demure air, he suspected him of quizzing the Deacon. "And so, Luther, you climbed the tree, like Zaccheus, to see better," continued the Deacon. "What did you want to see?" "I wanted to see the Hudson." "Can you see it from that tree?"' "No ir, not quite; but I can almost. I can see where it runs, and the hills on the other side; and I can see the tops of the vessels." "See the tops of the vessels, eh? Well, I shouldn't have thought it. And you'd like to see the vessels themselves, I'm sure. A North River sloop is no great sight; you should see the big ships down at New York." "But I suspect," interrupted Captain Combings with a whimsical squint, first at the Deacon and then at the boy, "that Luther has already seen as large and as fine ships as ever New York can show; haven't you Luther? You've Seen the Bassorah, the ship that Sinbad made his second voyage in?--and you've often been aboard of Captain Cook's ship, the Endeavor? And wasn't you cabin-boy on board of the Rat- tler when Captain Kidd murdered William Moore, as he sailed, as he sailed?  ' "Oh, yes!" exclaimed Luther, looking up and taking his cue from the Captain, "and I've seen Cleopatra's barge when she went to-visit Mark Antony." "Right, Luther;. that was a ship with her capstan bars and   NE VER AGAIN.       As 35 belaying pins of solid gold, and all her canvas, from courses to skysail, of the ffiest satin." "Why what on earth do you mean?" interrupted the Deacon. "I don't believe the boy has been three miles from Lake Mahopac in all his life." "Oh, that's nothing. Lake Mahopac is as big as the ocean when it is properly multiplied here," replied the Captain, put- ting his finger to his forehead and waggishy squinting at the mystified Deacon. "Oh! Captain, get out; you are .making fun of the poor child. I have never seen the ocean myself, but I guess it must be five hundred times as big as Lake Mahopac. You're a sailor, and ought to know how that is." "You're right, Deacon, we wont argue the point; but you are coming to Peekskill on Monday, why not give the-lad a lift down and up, and let him have a full view of the big river?" "Well, I don't mind if I do," replied the Deacon, "that is, Luther, if your mother will give you leave. You'd like to go? Yes. Well, I'd like very well to have you, for I'm going to drive my colts down, and I'm not sure they'll stand well in one streets, so you see it will be quite convenient to have some oneto look after them. You be ready bright and early Mon- day morning, and I'll pick you up as I come by your place. Get up now, pony; we've wasted too much time already, get up!" The Deacon accompanied the word with a blow, and his horse-a beast of spirit-started off at a round trot. The youth watched the buggy until it disappeared at a turn of the road, and then, buoyed up by the exultant flutter- ings of his own heart, flew, rather than ran, toward his home. "Oh, mother! mother!" he exclaimed to a thin, delicate, Ipatient-looking woman, who was sitting, needle in hand, on the back porch of an old weather-stained farm-house, with a large basket of worn and torn garments beside her. "Dea- con Dusenbury has asked me to go down to Peekskill with him on Monday. He's going to drive his gray colts, and he's   36         NEVER A GAIN. afraid they won't shkell in the streets without some one to look after them wiile he is running about. Mayn't I go, mother?-there's no school Monday, and the deacon says he can't go without me." "I am afraid, my dear," replied Mrs. Lansdale, " that your brother John will want you on Monday. He is going to be- gin clearing the old stump-field, and you know you are so handy with the steers." "I don',care what John wants!" exclaimed'the youth in an excited tone. "Deacon Dusenbury wants me, too, and you've promised me a hundred times that I should go down to the river the first chance. Every other boy around here has been down a dozen times. I promised you that I would never go down without letting you know. I have kept my promise, and you have broken yours. I could go down and back on foot any day. I've had fifty chances to ride, and every time John has interfered and prevented me. He inter- feres with me in everything. He doesn't want me to go to school. He locks up father's books. My Latin grammar is gone;--I'll bet he has burned it. Now this must stop. I won't stand it-I am not going to be his slave! I won't help him with the stumps on Monday-I won't work for him any more.

Startled from her usual serenity A *    1   NE VE R AGAIN.   37   by the unexpected and over-bearing passion of her favorite child, she readily promised him her permission to go with the Deacon, and soothed him with repeated assurances that she' would say nothing to John.    ' Selfish and tyrannical in disposition, and coarse and vio- lent in manner, this eldest son had, since the death of his father, assumed entire control of the family, composed- of his mother and six children, and also of the property, consist- ing of some two hundred acres of land, lying not far from the largest of the little lakes we have mentioned. Bitterly had Mrs. Lansdale regretted her weakness in submitting to the over-bearing and never-ending dictation of her son, and not unfrequently, in the interests of her other children, she had made efforts to withstand it, but in vain. Her placid and yielding nature was no match for the passionate and obstinate temper to which it was opposed. t Mrs. Lansdale was faithful to her promise; and on Mon- day morning Luther was allowed to slip off and join the -Deacon; his! mother covering his disappearance with some excuse until it was too' late for his recall. Ah! what a happy morning was- that when, for the first time, he saw from the high hill back of the town of Peeks- kill the broad Hudson gleaming at his feet. There were a dozen sloops, with their white sails trimmed close to the wind, beating up the stream, while a still greater number, with flowing sheets, were just issuing from the gorge'of the Highlands. There was a magnificent steamboat streaming along like a thing of life, and, like a thing of life, showing itself for a brief period between two eternities of mystery --the whence and the whither-the New York and Albany of his excited imagination. There, also, stretched out in Babylonian amplitude and magnificence, lay the- town, with its long streets, and lofty houses.' He turned to the Deacon, who was steadying his skittish horses in the descent Of the hill. He could hardly under- stand the old man's preoccupation with so comparatively un- important a matter; he could only wonder at and admire   38      -  NE VER AGA IN. his self-possession, his impassiveness, his apparent contempt of the grandeur and glory of the scene. The Deacon had always been a formidable character--thanks to his tall, stiff' figure and stern manner, and to the remembrance of sundry ear pullings for laughing in, Sunday-school. Now, measured by and found superior to the ten-thousand Goot standard of the young lad's excited feelings, he was absolutely grand. "Is New York really so much larger than the town before us?' Luther 'asked of the Deacon, in as calm. and emotion- less a tone as he could command. "I guess you won't rightly know the difference till you've been down to York some day," replied the Deacon. "York is a great place. Take about a hundred Peekskills, and put them all together, and you wouldn't begin to make one York." A hundred times as large as the town before them! The idea was too vast*. The lad felt that his voice would betray him if he asked any more questions. He sat silent, enjoying the bliss of a moment which in its unalloyed illusory fulness comes but once in a lifetime--and then only to those trained in the narrow and contracted limits of country domesticity- that moment when the shell of local habit is first chipped- -that instant when the chickens of fancy first fairly peep into the great outside world of fact. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the delight with which, while the Deacon was running about upon his business, the youth sat in the wagon, munching ginger-bread and watching the novel sights passing before his eyes. The colts proving very quiet, he was able, in the absence of the Deacon, to make frequent short excursions round the nearest corners until at length, getting more confident, he ventured a trip to an old sloop lying at the wharf. "Ha!  my young bald eagle! or maybe its a bear, eh?- ha!  ha! Well, give us your claw, or your paw!-I'm glad to see you. Came down with the Detcon, eh?" Luther blushingly acknowledged the salutation of Captain Combings, and accepted his invitation to step aboard the sloop. !   NE VER AGAIN.         39 The Captain, thrusting his hand down into the pocket of his coat on one side, and withdrawing it, produced a big api le. A profound dive into the other pocket was equally successful, and resulted in a handful of (oiled chestnuts. He had evidently supplied himself with a store of dainties for the reception of his youthful visitor. "And so," said the Captain at a pause in te conversation, which had at first run on the build and qualities of the sloop, the difficulties and dangers of Tappan Sea and Haverstraw Bay, and of the curious sights and shows of the great city, "and so your name is Luther-Luther Lansdale, and your father's name is"-         ', "John--John H.. Lansdale; but I haven't got any father now-he's dead." "Oh, yes; I forgot. I recollect now reading of his death some two or three years ago. Well," continued the Captain, "you may be sure he is in Heaven, for he was an honest man and believed in his Bible, and that will take any one there, I guess. I knew your father, Ituther, and I can speak a good word for him, although I did owe him a grudge once. You see he cut me out. I'll tell you how it was, and you'll see how near I came to being your father myself. I was once starting out from York a good many years ago; the steamboat was full of passengers, and when we had just got out into the bay -there came on a terrible squall. Night had just set in, and the clouds made it as black as pitch. Suddenly, smash went the connecting'rod. There was a heavy ebb tide, and we were carried down the bay like a shingle in a mnill-race) and we didn't any of us know but that we should be driven right out to sea. I went down into the cabin, and there such a taking on among the women no one ever did see. They were all crying and screeching and wringing their hands ex- cept one-a good-looking young woman, who was on her knees at prayer. In a few minutes she gotup, and I'll tell you what, there was just one tear-streak down her cheek, but besides that hei face was as smooth and composed as yours is at this moment, and she went around among the women r   :.40  v2     NE VER A GAIN. and children and so comforted them with a fewwords of faith and hope that in ten minutes .they were all as quiet as lambs. I looked at her, and thinks I to nyself, I'll marry that girl if I can, just so sure as we-get out bof this scrape, and I felt cer. tain of getting out of it; for if ten righteous men could have saved a city, one such woman was enough to have -saved a dozen North River craft. And sure enough in a few min- utes the wind fell, Staten Island light came out, and our Cap tain got up a jury mast forward, and rigged it with a piece of canvas for a foresail, just enough to give her steerage way until we fell in with a tug that took us back to the dock And who do you think the young woman was?" demanded the Captain. Luther shook his head. "She was nobody else but Polly Scott-your own blessed mother. But you see I was a little too late, and a little too ugly, I suppose. I followed her, up pretty well, until I found that she had made up her mind for your father, Colonel John Lansdale. The fact was, I was nothing but a youngster, and had no business to think of the thing. And besides, your father was a scholar and a gentleman, and he'd been a kind of stylish man down in the city until he lost his money, so when I found he carried too many gunsifor me, I put my helm up, w!e short round, and went off on another tack. Since those days I haven't laid eyes on her, although I used some times to meet your father. The other day when I was up to lake Mahopac I would have liked to stop and see her. How is she? I hope she is comfortable and hearty." s C'My mother is in very good health," replied Luther. ' And well to do in tho world?" "Pretty well; we've got a good farm--more than two hun dred acres."   A "Ah! that will do very well for your mother and brothers but you will want to spread yourself a little, I guess; I see it in your eye. You'll want to see more water than Lake Maho- pac has, jand more houses than Peekskill. Well, you just mention Captain Combings to your mother, and tell her from   NEVER A GAIN.          41 me that if ever you get a little restless and want to try your luck upon the river, or go a seeking your fortune down in York, to let you come here to me, and I,--Peleg Combings, -will give you a lift." Astonished and delighted at the Captain's generous offer, which seemed to open at once a pathway to the realization of the lad's wildest imaginings, Luther could hardly find words to express his grateful ackrowledgments. "Well, well," said the/Captain, "there is no use of any words about it. I've taken a notion to you, and, I'll do as I say. But here comes the Deacon; he's after you, I guess. H hope his colts haven't run away. He's looking cross enough to kick up and break things himself. I'll tell you what, I'll slush him down a bit while you slip around to the wagon."    +    *     *  ,          * More than two years had elapsed from the date of this first visit to Peekskill, and Luther had reached his seven- teenth year. He had grown tall and strong, and the spirit of adventure, fostered by a desultory course of travels and romances, had grown with his growth. But it was held some- what in check by his ardent desire for a complete and thor- ough education. He was a hard student, and had vigorously availed himself of all the opportunities within his reachl but would he ever have a chance at that crowning glory-a full collegiate course? Hardly; but if he could only go for a while to the nearest academic institution, that would be some- thing. The subject was often canvassed by himself and his mother. But if he could not continue his classical studies,--if his brother John was determined to foil his ambition in this re- spect,--why then he would go out into the world and content himself with making a fortune. It needs no great learning to do that. Are not all of our rich men notoriously ignorant of ,all except the art of money-getting? And after all, is not a fortune--a large fortune, the one great good in this life,-the one thing that everybody is striving after with heart and   42        N1 AgNRVER AGAIN. soul and brain,-the one thing that now more than ever world bows down to and adores,-the one powerful lever that lifts a man to place, either- as a leader of society; presiding officer of a great party, or member of a cabinet? Luther knew but little of New York, but he knew that it was the residence of Astor, and Vanderbilt, and Stewart; and can it be expected that an imaginative youth will remain blind to the glory of their achievements as reflected, almost from day to day, in the columns of the city press, or in the conversations of the country store, post-office or bar-room. This spirit had been further stimulated by two or three visits to Peekskill, and the encouraging conversation of Cap- tain Combings. But the desire of some change had received its highest energy from the increasing discomforts and vexa- tions of his domestic life. The relations between his brother John and himself had become those of determined and des- perate hostility. Stern commands and abusive words only roused in him a spirit of resistance. This, in turn, exasper- ated the elder brother, who felt bound to enforce submission; and the consequence was a state of open warfare, which, as John had grown to manhood, fell most heavily upon the younger and weaker, although not unfrequently in their per- sonal contests, Luther, after being soundly beaten, would con- trive, by a well-hurled stone, to take a satisfactory revenge. Poor Mrs. Lansdale often besought Luther with many tears to submit to John's authority, and to try to live with him on more peaceable terms; but as often as he promised to do so, some fresh act of tyranny, some new indignity would ren- der all his good resolutions impossible of performance. Upon- John, Mrs. Lansdale's gentle voice had but little effect. With uncommon energy, however, she insisted that Luther should be kept at school, instead of being compelled to stay at home and work upon the farm. By this means she succeeded in suspending for several hours in the day the brails which she so much deplored but could not prevent. Frequently Luther proposed to his mother that she should permit hid to accept the offer of her old admirer, Captain   *        XNEVER AGAIN.        45 Combings; but she could not make up her mind to part with him, although she freely admitted that it, would be perhaps tile best thing that he could do. "But then, Luther," she would exclaim a moment after, as if seeking reasons for jus- tifying her decision, "what should we do without you-you are so handy with the tools? None of your brothers are good for anything at tinkering; they couldn't now make one of your new-fashioned goose-yokes after seeing you do it twenty times. Or, supposing your dam and water-wheel, or some of the gearing should give out, and you were not here, we should have to work the churn again by hand." Luther had too much affection for his mother, and too keen a sense of filial duty to think of going without her con- sent. Besides, he had at the bottom of his heart a lurking fear of the unknown-a secret dread of knocking away the dog-shores of habit which alone held him to the domestic stocks, and of launching out into the great ocean of life, which served very much to counter-balance his intense curios- ity. It needed something more than the promptingsof the spirit of adventure and tke persecutions of his brother to drive him out from home, and that something soon came, at first in the form of ambition and the desire of knowledge, and then in the shape of mortified vanity, pride, and love. How or in what way Mrs. Lansdale raised the sums neces- sary for Luther's support at Dutchess County Academy was never known. Triakets, the jeweller in Maiden Lane, if ques- tioned, could perhaps tell of some nice little bargains that he made-a pair of ear-rings with diamond drops for half their val- ue, and quite a pretty set of coral, fuschia pattern, that Colonel Lansdale it was well-known had in his extravagant bachelor days bought at Naples and given ever so much money for at a time when coral was not worth one-third what it is now. At any rate, Mrs. Lansdale did raise the money--a few hundred dollars only, and Luther commenced his academic/, course. To say that he worked hard would be but doing him scant justice. He really overworked himself, urged on by the   -44         NEVER AGA-IN. conviction that, his mother's means were limited, that they probably would be soon exhausted, and that his academic career might at any moment come t6oan end. The first year passed rapidly and pleasantly, and the second was entered upon but with many misgivings; in fact Luther had begged his mother more than once in his letters to give up the con- test with John, and, looking only to her own peace and com- -fort, let him-Luther-go out into the world and begin his battle for fortune at once. His sense of the- instability of his position, while urging him to improve every moment of his time, grew so- strong that-it needed but the slighest push of circumstance to topple him over, and this push came about in the absurdest manner; but acting on such a sensitive com- pound of pride and humility, imagination" and sense, knowl- edge and ignorance, it was more than enough in his uncer- tain state of mind to decide him. The blow fell, and although as Mercutio says, " the wound was not as wide as a barn-door or as deep as a well," it was enough. The principal of the female department happened to be fat, fair, and almost forty, and with her it suited Luther's capricious fancy to fall desperately in love. He never told his love, nor even attempted to manifest it by the usual little attentions; he was too, much in awe of his divinity; but if -ever there was a stately, dignified, but withal rather good- looking, middle-aged woman adored at a respectful distance in silence, with a slight touch of despair, by a youthful but ardent lover, Miss Deborah Doolittle was the one. The influence of Luther's passion proved not unfavorable to his'studies, especially in the department of public speaking and English composition. He devoted his best energies to these branches. That she would hear him speak and listen to his compositions, fired his ambition. At the same time he hoped, by a judicious choice of speeches, and the artful in- fusion of delicate allusions in his compositions, to open her eyes to the state of his affections. For a long while he labored with this design, but with no very marked success. Sometimes he fancied that he could perceive the evidences of   emotion as he uttered, with his eyes directed full upon her, some tender sentiment; but he never could make up hissnind whether it was a cold, unimpassioned admiration of the author or orator, or something of a warmer and more affectionate feeling for the individual. A travelling book pedlar brought matters 'to a crisis. Luther's only dollar went for a morocco-bound, gilt-edged album. The pure white pages upon which so much glowing and touching sentiment might be written presented irresistible attractions. Who with the slightest literary turn has tiot felt the allurement and the charm? The unsullied expanse of paper appeals as directly and as forcibly to the imaginative youth as ever did the virgin snows of the Alps, or the unspot- ted fields of the pole, to the most daring climber or explorer -saying, "Come, track me; over and across me lies Parnas- sus with Musagetus himself and his sacred nine waiting to crown the G:(eat Poet." Luther had really quite'a pretty talent for verse-making. He had frequently exhibited it to the ad- miration of the whole school. He must commence himself with something original before soliciting contributions from others. What better than a delicate and nicely turned address to the object of his affections'? She herself was a poetess. A piece in the Poughkeepsie Eagle had been signed with her initials, although some said that D. D. stood for doctor of divinity. Itwas rumored that she had written something fine for Harper's Magazine, and her name had even been mentioned among the two hundred and twenty-five authors of "Beautiful Snow." Some allusion, therefore, to her as a poetess would be the proper thing-it would feather his shaft and carry it straight to the mark. A poetical cestrum that interrupted his studies for twenty-four hours resulted in the following lines: High o'er the surge, on craggy rough Leucate, Pale, tearful Sappho wails her wretched fate: With reckless step she seeks the awful steep, Waves her wild arms, and dares the desperate leap. Detested Phaon I storn of all true bards, To thus contemn fair. Sappho's fond regards!   "         IVE VER A GAIA.. Not thus with thee, who rivallest Sappho's strain, Not thine to fondly smile, and smile in vain,- Not thine a Phaon's cold contempt to prove, v But thine each heart, with slightest look, to move. Dost doubt'thy power? Ah, try it then on me; Try if, like Phaon, loving smiles I flee; Try me, if wanting Phaon's grace-his art, I want not, too, his cold, impassive heart! t Luther showed his verses to two of his schoolmates in whose literary judgment he had most confidence. "First rate," exclaimed Joe Fitchet. "Dang me, if it isn't as good as anything in the Ledger; it'll fetch her, sure pop." "Fetch who?" demanded Luther, indignantly. "Oh! go 'long now," put in Bill Gabson. "Don't you go for to act like an old turkey-gobbler with his head in a corn- shook,) and think that nobody don't see you. Don't we know who your Sappho is? I should just like to see her jump off a big rock; wouldn't she come down all ker-flop. She'd shake the poetry opt of all creation. People would think that Mount Toby had-turned a summersault, or that a cattle train had telescoped the Harlem Express." Luther closed his book with a bang, and slamming it into his. drawer, rushed out for a solitary walk without waiting for any further criticisms on his poetry. The   next day he despatched the book into the girl's department, with a verbal request through the bearer for con- tributions to its pages. Unfortunately, however, after having racked his brains for some kind of motto or title-page for that portion of it in which he wished the girls to write, and having composed and rejected a dozen verses, in despair of an ele- gant simplicity he suddenly selected the most awkward piece of doggerel of them  all: "Dear Ladys please to here indite A few lines for this daring wight ; He hopes that you will not refuse, And his presumption you'll excuse." This was bad enough, but unluckily, in his anxiety respecting I    NE VER AGAIN.          47 the chirography, he contrived to make a most unfortunate and patent blunder in spelling. With a trembling heart he prepared himself to await for two or three days the result. Would Miss Deborah Doo- little see it? Would she condescend to write in it? And if she did write in it, would her composition consist of original or: selected verse? Conjecture, stimulated bly love, hope and fear, was actively at work, but completely at fault. Luther's suspense, however, was not destined to be of long duration. The slow-houred school-day had come to its close, and he was locking up his drawer of books for the night, when his attention was attracted by the voice of a little girl at hisi, side. ( Here. is your album," she said; "Miss Doolittle told me to bring it in, and give it to you," and putting the book upon his desk, with a blush and a courtesy, she ran from the ram. It was of no consequence how quickly she went. Luther could not have asked her for an explanation had she stayed an hour. There lay the book returned to him-contemptuously returned too, as he felt; and his request for contributions re- fused!  But perhaps something had been written in it? He did not, however, dare open it-he felt a presentiment of some terrible blow to his self-love. With an outward calmness of manner which strangely belied his internal agitation, he seized the book, put it under his arm, and set out to4 the little lake on the outskirts of the village. As he went along he pondered a variety of solu-' tions suggested by his imagination, but it was some time be-:., fore he could muster up the courage to seek the true explana-  tion in the book itself. Mentally reproaching himself for being "such a darned fool," he turned aside, and leaping a fence, seated himself out of sight from  the highway on a fallen log. The level beams of the setting sun were lingering upon the surrounding hill-tops, masses of golden and ruby clouds hung in graceful canopy over the burnished and glitter- ing surface of the little lake. As he opened the book the pages assumed a  pinky hue, and, as he fancied, blushed for   t ' ' 48         NEVER AGAINA. his coming shame. He turned them slowly over, but could 'discover no marks of the pen. His breath came again, and ihis agony of doubt and fear began to subside. "There must have been some mistake about it-but what is this? Ha! a pencil mark!" He read, and again he read,-when a dark- ness came across his eyes. All nature seemed turning topsy- turvy-the trees began to dance, Mount Toby shook with sup. pressed laughter, and East Mountain nodded derisively to West Mountain. The more distant hills began to wriggle and writhe like corn-ricks in a hurricane, and the surface of the lake to split itself up and fly in pieces like fragments of a huge mirror. The darkness passed, and to the horror succeeded :rage- rage at his own stupidity and folly. He tore his hair, ground his teeth, gesticulated furiously with clenched fists, and hurl- ing the unlucky volume to the ground, stamped upon it with all his force.         - ' A calm succeeded, but it was the calm of despair. He picked up the mutilated book, and read the pencilled words again: "The ladies do not please to do anything for a boy who can't spell." There could be no doubt that it was her hand. There in glowing plumbago were his own stately, sharp- angled letters. But he could hot blame her. He deserved il all, and more. True, it was the blunder of carelessness rather than ignorance; but could he make any explanation? Whl would believe it? Was it not notorious that he was weak in orthography? Ah, there was the sting! It is always the one little lurking drop of truth which gives bitterness to any amount of misrepresentation. Simple, pure falsehood, no mat ter how malicious, seldom hurts anybody. However much he might excel in other branches, he couldn't spell ;,and what was more, he couldn't learn to spell. He had tried it, faithfully and failed. It was clear that he had no memory for the col location of letters. There were boys in the school for whose talents he had the most profound:contempt---dunces-regulai pig-headed fellows who could beat him in spelling with. ease And he had comforted himself-ass that he was!-with thl   NEVER AGAIN.          4! reflection that Napoleon Bonaparte spelled execrably! PooY consolation now, in this agony of shame and vexation! \ But it was not alone the mortification of having made such * a mistake that overwhelmed him. It was as much the con temptuous terms in which the reproof was conveyed. To be called a boy--and by her, too! He!--a young man almost eighteen, and old enough to be desperately in love with a woman of thirty-five!"Oh, stupid fool! dolt! idiot!" he groaned, as the wounds of love and vanity gaped and smarted. "But i have one resource--never shall she see me again! I will go-if I have to go penniless, friendless, and without my mother's blessing-far from this scene of my disgrace!" Luther rushed back to his room, and without saying a word to any one, packed up, his small store of books and cloth- ing, and taking his trunk upon his shoulders, started for the depot. There was an evening way train, and luckily he had left in his pocket just fifty cents-the fare between his school and the station nearest to his home. By ten o'clock he was out of the train, had trudged the intervening four miles, and was in the arms of his mother. He found his mother alone, and without circumlocution announced his inten- tion of leaving home forever. "You know," he exclaimed, "that I have anticipated mat- ters only by a few days; our term lacks but a fortnight of its end. I could not continue there another term. You know t would be impossible for you to furnish the money either for my tuition or board; and if you could, I will not consent to any more sacrifices for me. I am not worth it. Oh, if you knew all, you would see that I am not worth it! Let me go away and get my own living. Let me seek my fortune in the city; I am sure I shall find it. I should like to pursue my studies, but every day that I am kept from actually doing something in the world I feel to be lost; every time I read the Hferald I feel guilty; I feel that I, too, ought to be laying the foun- dations of a big fortune. Oh, I must begin mother; I must begin at once!" Carried away by his impetuosity, Mrs. Lansdale was at   50        NEEVER A GA IN. length compelled to give her consent, and she did soQ[ith less reluctance when he finally confessed the blunder of the album and admitted the peculiar state of his affections. The uncom- fortable relations between the two brothers also rendered some change advisable, and Mrs. Lansdale admitted that for some time it had been merely a question of time and manner, and that she had long felt .that sooner or later her beloved boy would be compelled to leave home. She was too wise a woman to argue the question of blighted love, or to ridicule his feelings. She knew that in a day or two his excited fancy would cool down, and that in the meantime it would be useless to try and convince him that the Miss Doolittle of his imagination had no real existence. She knew that an igno- rance of life and the world so dense could only be cured by contact with the actual and real. Alas, that the cure in most cases should be so rapid and so complete! It was finally settled that Luther should go as soon as his mother could prepare his small kit of clothing, and that noth- ing should be said to John about it until after his departure. His mother also proposed that he should wait until he found one of the neighbors going down to Peekskill, with whom he might ride, but Luther would not listen to any such idea. Captain Combings was known to be at Peekskill; in a day or two at most he would be getting under way. Luther was anxious to be off, and his own legs he knew from good experi- ence would be no poor dependence for a trip of fifteen or, six- teen miles. The next day his mother was employed in mending and putting in order his few garments. When night came, and the family had retired to rest, she sat up with him until a late hour by the-kitchen-fire talking over his plans. She gave him what most mothers give-a great deal of good advice, which, like most young men, he at the time promised faithfully to fol- low; and in addition she gave him an old eel-skin pouch con- taining twenty-five dollars in gold, which, with many cautions against the sharpers and pickpockets of the city, she showed him how to strap around his waist. The interview finished    NEVER AGAIN.           51 with a prayer and her blessing, and then a good hearty cry and a good hearty kissing. As no sleep visited Luther's eyes that night, he was up bright and early before John, who had returned the evening before, was stirring. A bowl of bread and milk was in read- iness for him, but he could swallow only a few mouthfuls. His mother helped him to strap his kit on his back, and ac- companied him to the high-road. One last embrace, and she knelt upon the stile with her apron to her eyes. Luther lin- gered on the other side, but with a wave of her hand she motioned him away. "Go, my son," she exclaimed, "and may the God of the widow and the fatherless go with you!" Luther trudged on sturdily for a few moments, and then looking back he could still dimly discern her kneeling figure in the glimmering light of the early dawn.    CHAPTER III. Launching Out-The Highlands of the Hudson--A Poor Pun--A Terrible Catastrophe-An Absurd Discussion-The Rescue--The Great City. THE first and most pleasing object that Luther noticed upon coming in sight of the village of Peekskill wmas the red swallow-tailed pennant, flying from the Montaigne, Captain Combings' old sloop. He reached her just in time to step on board before she swung clear of the wharf "All right, Luther," exclaimed the Captain, "jump aboard --glad to see you. So you've come at last-thought you would. Brought your traps with you? Well, take your bun- die Obwn into the cabin, and then come up and I'll give you a rope to haul on. We will talk about your mother when we get out into the stream." Very much to Luther's surprise, and at first somewhat to his disappointment,-the course of the Montaigne proved tc be up the river, before a strong tide and wind. "You thought you were going to York, eh?" said Captain Combings. "Well, so we will, but not just yet. I have an i engagement up-stream for a couple of loads of brick, and af- ter that, my boy, we will go down to the city. Look out for sights then!  But for my part, I don't think any sights on this side of the Atlantic can be finer than these we are just com- ilg to. Here we are at the entrance to whlt, is called the Highlands of the North River. This big mountain on the right is Anthony's Nose. What a famous nose Anthony Van Corleat, the old trumpeter, must have had to have suggested the name? Below there, to the left, is Stony Point. You   NEVER AGAIN. recollect the story?-the surprise, the desperate assault, and the bloody fight. The taking of that fort, by Wayne, was as gallant a feat as was performed in the Revolutionary War, or in any other war. And there, right in front of us, you see that plateau where you can trace some old ruins. That Was Fort Montgomery, and commanded the entrance to this part of the river from below, Clinton took it, you kn6w, but he couldn't get any further up the river; and as Burgoyne could not get down the river to join him, the consequence is that you and I are free-born Americans and sailing to-day in the old Mon- taigne after a load of brick." The breeze had fallen to a gentle zephyr-just strong enough to give steerage-way to the sloop, as she floated silently in the deep shadow along the bases of the overhanging hills. A dozen broad white sails were in sight, some slowly moving up-stream before the wind, and some industriously trying to beat in short tacks to windward. As the tide began to make against them, these latter would let run their halyards and drop their anchors-the sudden -sound of the falling canvas and the rattling of the chains skimming the surface of the smooth water and arousing the echoes of the surrounding hills. Luther seated himself upon the 'deck, and leaned back with his head uipfthe low taffrail, occasionally arousing him- self to follow the movements of the Captain's forefinger as he pointed out spots famousj lhistory or tradition. But he asked few questions-he was too full of the whole scene to attend to the details, and it needed not the historic or romantic associa- tions of particular localities to heighten his emotion. Not the least interesting object was the Captain himself, as he stood with one leg resting on the tiller, his elbow upon his leg, and his chin in his hand. An old straw hat adorned his head; a dingy cotton shirt, and a pair of gray woollen trowsers, turned up around the legs of a stout pair of cow- hide boots, completed his apparel. In person he was short but stoutly built, with something more of a salt-water air about him than is ordinarily to be seen in the captains of   54        NE rES A4GAI .IA  . North River sloops. He had a roll in/his gait that was never got from the swell of Tappan Sea or Haverstraw Bay. His eyes had evidently seen foreign service; one of them in par- ticular had a comical twist that seemed to speak of a long look out for squalls. A brilliant head of red hair, a conm- plexion that looked not unlike a piece of purple morocco fresh from the .pomelle of the graidr, and a broad humorous mouth full of strong white teeth, constituted all his claims to physical beauty; but there was something more and better in the simple but great and brave spirit that informed all his features, and spoke in every tone, glance, and gesture. He had, as he told Luther, begun life as a cabin-boy in a Canton ship; had done a sailor's duty before the mast in every quarter of the globe, and at last had risen to the command of a crazy old bark in which he had made several voyages to Europe and the Brazils. Becoming tired of the sea, or rather of his vessel and her owners, and having saved money enough to build a sloop of his own, he had resolved to settle down to the more regular, and, if less dignified, less hazardous, navi- gation of the Hudson. "Look there, Luth," exclaimed the Captain, after a pause in the conversation, " look there; that white thing on the edge of the bank up yonder is Kosciusczko's monument, and this point of land around which the river bends is West Point, and there, way up on the top of the hill there, those crumbling walls are the ruins of Fort Putnam. Take a good look on 'em, Luth, for they are just about-to my mind-the finest thing on the Hudson. 'Tisn't because Fort Put is the high- est hill or the handsomest, but because it has a kind of human look about it. Now, the other hills of the Highlands are very beautiful and very grand, and they throw a shadow upon one's thoughts, dark and deep as this upon the river, but they have got nothing upon them for the eye or the fancy to rest upon, except rocks and trees. A&fellowlooks at them; Luther but before he can fairly clinch them in his mind's grasp, he has to go way back beyond the days of old Noah. Aye! even beyond the days of Adam, and that strains the imag-   xE VER A GA z   .      5s ination terribly. It wants a cable-laid fancy to stand suchN a pull. No inch-a-half running stuff is strong enough to hold on to those big hills surging about in the old ocean of chaos, and even if it was, you'd have to take a good hearty turn about the bitts of the Bible to keep your catechism instincts from being jerked -right out of you; mere creeds and articles and confessions and doctrines, and all such kind of church deck-stoppers, wouldn't hold ten minutes. "Now look at Fort Put there-there is something human -not new, poor, sixpenny human, but old, respectable and venerablle human; but not too old, not beyond the memory of man or the records of history. You don't have to go back beyond the days of '76 before you get an understanding of the means and ends of that hill; you feel at once that it was just shoved up there to put the fort upon." "If the hill was shoved up out of the ground expressly to put the fort upon," interrupted Luther, " it seems very proper that the fort should be named Fort Put." "Luther," replied the Captain reproachfully, "I didn't ex- pect that of you.  I didn't think .that you would go for to in- dulge in an? small wit right under KIosciusczko's monument, and within sight of those old walls and ramparts around which still play the memories of Arnold's treason and Andre's fate. Look up there, Luther, and tell me, if you can, whether the rosy light illuminating the gray stones of old Fort Put is the lingering beams of the setting sun or the condensed glory of the American Revolution." Luther felt himself justly rebuked for his miserable at- tempt at a pun, amid such scenes and associations, and for a while there was a pause in the conversation. "But," resumed the Captain, " it is not alone for the stones fand traditions connected with scenes like these that we look at them with pleasure.  There is something more than all that. They give, as I said before, a human feeling and a human interesstanature. Perhaps we don't know anything about their history or. traditions. You don't know who built them, or just what kind- of a crew-whether lubbers or able-   -56         NE VER AGAIN. hands, buccaneers or fair-traders--manned the battlements; there they are, time-honored evidences of man's labors, of his sufferings and his joys. And the landscape is all the richer. It is in this way, and only in this way, that the famous Rhine beats the Hudson." "You have seen the Rhine?" demanded Luther. "Yes. You see I was once mate of the bark Zampa, and we were bound to Hamburg. Well, we drew too much water to go up to the town, so we moored to one of the spiles standing in the river, and began to unload into a lighter. It had been pretty cold for several days, when suddenly there came on a thaw and a freshet; the river rose, and the' ice broke and came down upon us in great floes, one of which-- a ten-acre piece-cut a hole in the Zampa's bows that in about: five minutes saved us any further trouble with either ship or cargo. She went down, and when or how they got her up again I never stopped to inquire. I knew they could do noth- ing with her until spring, so I started for home; but first I thought I'd see something of the country. I cut across to Cologne, took a trip up the Rhine as far as Strasburg, and then through France to Paris, and so on to Havre and home. But you know all about the Rhine from your school-books, I suppose?" Luther modestly denied all pretensions to a complete knowledge. "You know where it rises?" demanded the Captain. "In the Alps of Switzerland, by three small heads." "Good! And what lake does it run through?"- "Lake Constance." "And where does it empty?" "It empties itself by several mouths into the German Ocean." "Smart boy, Luther; you'll see the Rhine one of these days, and then you will see for yourself that as regards the nature of the stream it ain't equal to this. The part that folks rave about is very much like our Highlands here, but the hills are really not so fine. However, that is more than   N AEE I'R AGA-IV. made up by those old castles. - Just imagine every hill we have passed to-day to be crowned with mellow-looking ruins, like old Fort Pllt, and you will get an idea of the Rhine be- tween Bonn and Mayence." Following the Captain's directions, Luther was endeavor- ing to cap each peak in sirght with an old ruined fort, incon- gruously jumbling the low curtain and solid bastion of mod- ern fortifications with the tall towers and turretted walls of medieval defence, when the roll of a drum floated downward from the table-land above, and was followed by the report of a cannon. It was the evening gun of the post, -and announced that the cadets were engaged at parade. The breeze had now died away entirely; a few stars began to show themselves, and the shadows of the surrounding hills flowed down like. a flood of ink upon the bosom of the river. The sloop was well in under the right bank of the stream when Captain Combings ordered an anchor to be let go, the sails hauled down, and a light hoisted on the forestay to indi- cate his position to any steamer passing in the night. The caboose fire was lighted, and a fragrant supper of ham and eggs prepared. The Captain and his two mates-crew there was none-then filled their pipes, and after a half-hour's smoke, retired to their berths in the little cabin. Room had been made for Luther by removing from its shelf the Captain's library, consisting of Shakespeare, Montaigne's essays, a vol- ume of old English comedies, with Plutarch's Lives, Rollins' Ancient History, and Russell's Modern Europe, in all thirty or forty volumes, well thumbed and thoroughly digested. For a while Luther remained above, after the others had retired. He walked the deck, speculating on the new pros- pects which were opening to him, and building castles in the air of the loftiest description. Now and then, to his praise be it- said, notwithstanding the excited state of his imagina- tion, his thoughts turned to the home that he had left most probably forever, and to that dear loving mother whose affec- tion had lightened so many of his childhood's cares and trou- bles. Occasionally he paused, and leaning over the,main   58-        NEVER AGAIN. boom listened to the dreamy sounds that now and then floated along the lazy stillness of the water-the plashing of distant paddle-wheels, or the rush of escaping steam-the lowing of calves, and the bleating of sheep pent up in market barges- the doleful tooting of a solitary owl--the strilulous song of the katydid-the barking of dogs, or the tones of the human voice. Tired out at last, Luther sought his berth, or book-shelf rather, and scrupulously saying his customary ' Now I lay me," he closed his eyes, little dreaming of the terrible shock that was to greet him on awaking. Luther's sleep was disturbed by a host of images, among which prominently figured the face of Miss Doolittle, only instead of her own beautiful nasal organi she seemed to have adopted/a monstrous mass of rock which the Captain had pointed out as being the well-known Anthony's Nose. Half awake and half asleep, he turned and twisted and groaned, but could not get rid of that nose. It was An- thony's Nose, and yet it was Miss Doolittle's nose-it was a mountain of rock, and yet it was a veritable organ of flesh and blood. Conscious at length that the disagreeable impression was but the illusion of a dream, he crawled out of his berth, and vigorously rubbed his eyes until fairly awake: it was about three o'clock in the morning. He pulled on his trowsers, and stepped up the narrow companion-way on to the deck. The night was "pitch dark"-a  thick canopy of clouds being drawn across the narrow strip of sky between the tops of the hills. Luther noticed that the signal light which had been fas- tened in the forestay had gone out, and he hesitated for a moment as to whether he should call one of the men, or at- tempt to re-light it himself. At this moment his attention was excited by the sound of paddle-wheels and the rush of a boat- through the water. He strained his eyes, but could see noth- ing. The sounds which had at first been cut off and dead- ened by an intervening point of land suddenly grew loud,  NE VER A GAIN.         59 louder, louder still. The steamer had just rounded the point, and was evidently close aboard of them. "She is certainly," muttered Luther, "going to give us a good wide berth in due time." He waited a moment, but there was no change in her course as indicated by her lights. She was not a hundred yards off, and coming down at the rate of twenty miles an hour. Luther sent up a shrill shout of warning to the steamer; and then bounding to the companion-way, called loudly to the Captain. As he raised himself from his stooping posture, the steamer's bow-light hung almost over his head. He shut his eyes instinctively at the appalling proximity of the monstrous vessel, and before he could open them, her bow struck the sloop a little forward of midships, and with a sharp crash cut entirely through her with as much ease as if she had been made of paper. . Luther clung to the taffrail, which for a moment was tilted up and canted over. He saw the figures of the Captain and his men struggling from the companion-way, and then a rush of water took him off his feet and carried him deep down in the uwhirlpool of the sinking vessel. He was, however, an ctive and buoyant swimmer, and struggled desperately until at last he found himself rising, and soon his head came above the surface of the water. None too soon, however, for his senses had almost deserted him, and he was a minute or two before he could comprehend his position. The steamer was about two hundred yards off, lying to. There was the noise of many voices, mingled with the whiz- zing of steam from the escape-pipe, and the plashing of boats as they fell from their davits. "Luther! Luther!" shouted the stentorian voice of Cap- tain Combings, in tones of intense anxiety. "Here I am, sir," replied Luther, stretching out towards the quarter whence came the Captain's voice. "Can I do any- thing for you?" ' Do anything for me? Why you've done the best thing   60        NEI VER A GAIN. for me in answering my hail. I was afraid you had gone down to the bottom, with the wreck, and the river here is tcwo hundred feet deep."  "If I had got down as far as that, it would have been all up with me, I guess," replied Luther. "I guess so too, but you are all sound; no bones broken, eh?" "I feel all'right-just as if I could swim a couple of miles or so. Shall we strike out for the shore? It can't be three hundred yards off." "No, no; we should land in the buslies, and t would be hard work to scale those rocks barefoot. Hold on, and in a minute or two the steamer's boats will be down for us. I can hear the oars in the rowlocks. I'll give them a hail." The Captain shouted at the top of his lungs, and was answered as well by the boats as by his two men, who were plashing and thrashing the water in a manner to indicate that, although frightened, they were accustomed to swimming, and could retain their position on the surface with ease. "All safe!" ejaculated the Captain. "Thank God- for that; we have had a narrow escape, Luther. Nothing but a special interposition of Providence could have saved some of us from being smashed up by the wheels." "Don't you think that it was a special interposition of Providence that made the steamer run on to us?" demanded Luther. "Well, I suppose so," replied thl Captain, blowing the water from his mouth. "Oughtn't we to thlank God for that too, then," inquired Luther with a slight chuckling laugh a the absurdity of a dis- cussion of the doctrine of special Provilences under such cir- cumstances. "Well, yes; I  suppose we ought,-although I can't see;- the exact ground for gratitude in the case, unless it was that she struck -us forward of midships. For you see, Luther, if she had struck us further afq our stern would have been whirled right under her wheels, and then"-   AE VER AGAIN. "Then no special interposition of Providence would have saved us," said Luther. "Exactly; but here comes the boat," exclaimed the Cap- tain, striking out vigorously, and not unwilling to escape a conversation in which he found himself rapidly getting beyond his depth. The steamer's deck was all alight and alive, and a hun- (dred anxious faces, peered down upon the boats as they came alongside. Poor Captain Combings had had no time to make his tolte and he was compelled to mount to the deck with no more clothing than he had on when jumping from his berth. His ingle scanty cotton garment but poorly con- cealed his confusion and dismay at the sight of several female passengers, who, with night-caps on their heads and a mixed expression of curiosity and fear in their countenances, had sallied out from the ladies' saloon. He stopped not to answer any questions, but quickly disappeared with some of the officers of the boat. As Luther, thanks to his restlessness and perturbed dreams, was in a more presentable garb, he was Arrested in front of the ladies' saloon by the anxious crowd, and closely questioned, particularly by several elderly females, a to the nature and cause of the accident. He explained that he was only a pas- senger and had had nothing to do with the management of the sloop. His testimony as to the fact of there having been no light on the sloop at the time of the collision seemed to give great satisfaction to the captain of the steamboat, who made Luther 'formally repeat the assertion in presence of the crowd. "Your name is Luther Lansdale," he said, making a inemorandum in his pocket-book. "And where are you to to be found, if I or my owners should want to see you in relation to this matter?" Luther hesitated for a moment, partly from a vague appre- hension of being dragged into court, and that too in some way to the detriment of his friend Captain Combings, and partly from a sense of shame at being unable to give any very    52        NEVE 4 AGAIN.  precise answer. To the question of the captain, he was however compelled to reply that he had no address, that he was going down to New York, but that he had not the least idea where he should stay, or what he should do, and that he had been utterly unable to mfake up his mind as to what occupation or employment he should seek or accept. As he made the con- fession the two antagonistic poles of the real and the ideal met him here for the first time, and the tension of his over- c!harged fancy was reduced by the shock. A sense of incon- gruity, a conviction of the monstrous preposterousness of his expectations, flashed upon him, and his voice faltered. ' "Have you no friends in New York?" said a low, soft voice just behind him. There was something in the tone inappreciable by the grosser sense of hearing-something that seemed to enter the portals of the ear, decline the ordinary route of the auditory nerve to the brain, and descend by the shortest possible cut to the heart. Luther turned, and beheld the very face which he had seen a thousand times before. He had seen it in the clouds, he had seen it in the glassy water of his mountain lake.  He had seen it peeping out at him from the rustling foliage of the trees, from beneath the waving grass, and the bending corn. He had seen it, amid the glowing coals, the volleying smoke, the flickering lights and shadows of the kitchen fire. It had often smiled at him from the pages of a book, and had even winked lovingly and knowingly from the depths profound of his old scratched and frameless school slate. At least if it was not the very same face, it was one so very much like it that it made Luther start. It was the bright face of a young girl, of perhaps sixteen. Oval in shape, with fine delicate features, and a pale but pure corn- plexion, it was a thoroughly American face, and yet with :l slight fulness and roundness of line that suggested Italy, and indicated a capacity of passion and feeling deeper than gen- erally belongs to the common American type. Her eyes were dark gray, and had Luther been less ern- barrassed, and the lights better, and her ringlets not in- curl    NEVER AGAIN.          63 papers, he might have observed that her hair was a dark auburn. A large blanket shawl was thrown over her head and confined around her throat by one white hand, while the other rested on the arm of a tall, elderly gentleman, who, in his hurry and fright, had neglected to assume any garments, except his waistcoat and pantaloons. ( Have you no friends in New York?" she again inquired, seeing that Luther hesitated. "Not one, Miss," replied Luther, bowing and blushing; i not even an acquaintance that I know of." "Indeed .^-a4 the young girl turned to her father. "Oh, father, how will he get along?--whlat can he do?" "I intend to do as others have done," returned Luther, in quite a withering and sarcastic tone. "(I intend to make a fortune!" "And not a friend?-not even an accuaintance?" she exclaimed in a pitying voice and looking up appealingly in her father's face. "Poor boy!" There was something in her voice and words that sent a thrill of pleasure through Luther, but there was also some- thing which jangled harshy amid the sensitive chords of his complex nature. He, the lord of unbounrded possessions, with a magnificent castle in every country under heaven, to be pitied by a stranger--a girl younger thar himself, because nobody in one single city, and that not the largest in the world, had the honor and pleasure of knotting him! And the "poor boy" too! Why it was worse and more contemp- tuous than Miss Doolittle's "boy" of tie orthographical blunder; and besides, Miss Doolittle was a:n old woman and not at all a stylish woman, and utterly withcut what Luther's uninstructed instinct recognized at once as evidences of social position.  "Not a friend, Miss!" he replied, drawing himself up as stiffly as possible, ' but I presume I shall have when-when, that is-after I find the fortune which I am going to seek. Wealth," continued Luther in a tone which was meant to be particularly sarcastic, anc which could not have been more n          I *   i,!   "        NE ER4 GAIN. haughty had he been master of the Indies,-" wealth never wan'ts friends in New York, I believe." The young girl looked at him for a moment with a puz. zled expression.. Luther's countenance fell ; a sense of shame at his rudeness brought-the blood to his cheeks, a conviction of the absurdity of his speech, of its inartistic inappropriate. ness and incongruity sent it back to his heart in a suffocating tide of contending emotion. How silly to be offended at her pitying exclamation, or even at her expression " poor boy." He was a poor boy; a stupid, mean-spirited, miserable boy! And hrw did he know that she was rich, or that she unduly prided herself upon wealth, or that she was one of those city folks whom he had heard often derided as " stuck up." Bah! what a fool! what an ass! what a ridiculous blockhead he must appear in her eyes,and in the eyes of all who were looking on! The features of the young girl relaxed into a smile. Per- haps if her heart had not been so full of pity--and maybe, too, that if Luther, with his damp hair curling in thick waves around his brown and ruddy face, and his eyes glowing with his rapidly-sweeping and contrary emotions, had not been so good looking,-she would have laughed outright. "I meant no offence by the expression," she replied. "Papa will tell you that it is no reproach to be without friends, or even ac- quaintances in a city that one has never visited. I don't know much about it, but I believe they are very necessary to help one to look after a fortune." And the young girl emphasized the word fortune with a slightly sarcastic smile, but as if anxious to atone by some act of real kindness for anything that might wound feelings so sensitive or offend an egotism so marked, she suddenly turned to her father: "Perhaps you can do something, papa, towards putting him in the way to wealth; you want a boy- a  young gentleman I mean-in your counting-room, don't you?" "I don't know my dear," replied the gentleman; "he seems to be in no need of any assistance, and least of all, yours.    xNEVER AGAC z.         65 r  You had better go to your berth now. Come, they are start- ing the engine, and there is nothing further to fear." It was evident, more from his tone than his words, that Luther had made no very pleasant impression upon him. This however would not have disturbed the young man much, but he felt really sorry that he assumed such a rude and ridic- ulous air towards the young lady. His discomfiture was com.- plete, when she partially withdrew her arm from her father's, ' and leaning back towards him, whispered in a tone of hearty and unaffected interest: "You may want employment some time and be unable to find it; many young men are, I have heard it said, in that condition in the city. If so, apply to Mr. Led- geral, of the firm of Ledgeral, Shippen & Co., Burling Slip. You shall have my influence in that quarter, and little as you think so now, it may be of use." With a smile and a nod of the head, she disappeared within the door of thegliadies's-aluun.- "Come young man," said the captain of the steamboat, "you had better go into the boiler-room and dry your clothes, and then you can go down below and take any of the empty berths; there are plenty of 'em." Luther'declined the captain's offer, preferring, as the night was warm and he had no desire for sleep, to stretch himself upon a settee on deck. He had enough to think of-'the ac-, cident to the sloop-his narrow escape-his mother-Miss Doolittle and his unlucky blunder-and last, but not least, the young girl who had spoken to him with so much kindness and interest, so politely and so pleasantly. "Miss Ledgeral! But what can her first name be? Helen, or 'Mary, or perhaps Isabel? No, Isabel is Spanish, and of course a brunette; it may be Mary--Mary always has blue eyes. Her eyes are gray. No matter, I shall never see her again; never speak to her again. Bah! she wouldn't let me speak to her again; and serve me right too-such a dolt!-such an idiot! But I never will apply to her father-the idea is preposterous. I apply to suclh a purse-proud old fool? Never! I wouldn't ask the slightest favor from him-I would starve first! But 5   "        NE VER AGAIN. why should I feel angry with her simply because I am angry with myself? Come, come, Luther Lansdale, be a little more generous, or rather a little more just. She meant no offence, and you were a stupid jackass to take any. - Well, I will see her once more when she leaves the boat, and thank her at least for her kindness. Not that I will ever follow her direc- tions : no, never! - Old Ledgeral shall never see my face again -that is not until I am rich: then--well, what then? Why then, perhaps, I should like to meet his handsome daughter again. How handsome she is! Miss Doolittle--pooh! She is ten thousand times as handsome as Miss Doolittle!" Thus ran Luther's thoughts until the boat began to glide by the docks and houses of the upper part of the city. A few purple streaks in the eastern sky announced the rapidip- proach of morning, lighting up the numerous spires of the churches, and the long blocks of red brick houses, and dis- closing deep views through numberless narrow streets into the heart of that most mysterious and impressive of all objects -a slumbering city. . One by one the passengers emerged from the cabins, laden with cloaks, umbrellas -and carpet bags. Porters appeared, carrying trunks of all sizes and colors, followed hither and thither by jealous and anxious owners; a hugh pile of luggage arose at the larboard gangway; haw- sers, by which to swing the boat into her berth and secure her, were stretched along the deck; the heaving-ropes, care- fully coiled, hung ready from the hands of the mates. The ladies' saloon had poured/forth a crowd of its inmates, but still Luther could not get ,a glimpse of the face he wanted to see. He stationed himself so as to command a view of the main entrance to the ladies' cabin, and watched and waited until at last he began to be afraid that she had passed in the crowd, or-had gone ashore by some short cut that the other passengers knew nothing about, or that, like an image-full nist on the hillside, or a floating cloud blushing in the last rays of the setting sun, or a sportive shadow on the surface of his mountain lake, or a lovely shape of some pleasant and vivid dream, the vision of the night had in reality vanished   NEVER AGAIN. with the light, or had perhaps landed durirg the night in a supersensuous small boat rowed by phantoms at some invisi- ble point on the Hudson. At the last moment, however, his fears were dispelled. As the crowd were beginning to ascend the gangrway plank, she emerged from the saloon, leaning on the arm of'her father. Luther hesitated a moment, but see- ing the attention of the gentleman was mainly occupied in securing a safe passage with her through the throng, he vigorously thrust himself forward, and crossed the plank by her side. He bowed and blushed, as she turned to his whis- pered "Good morning," and recognized him. "Good morning, Miss Ledgeral. I want to say that I am much obliged to you for your kind words. H-I-thank you very much, that is as much as-as-as if I needed them- that is as if-as if"-- "Good bye, Mr. Lansdale," replied the young girl, laying a slight emphasis upon the Mr. "Recollect the firm, Led- geral, Shippen & Co., or perhaps you had better, if you want to see my father, come to our house in Waverly Place, Wash- ington Square: you will find the house easily enough. Good bye!" There was a slight smile on her lips; whiich Luther imag- ined to be contemptuous and sarcastic, but which to any one less morbidly sensitive would have seemed merely good- natured and sweet. He returned her salutation somewhat coldly, and sprang back to the deck of the boat. "I apply to her father for assistance of any kind!" he muttered. "I put myself in her way again, after she has seen me in this plight, without hat, or coat, and laughed at me! Never!- never! I hope I may die if I do! What do I care for her?" he continued, as he ran up to the promenade deck, to catch a last look ai she entered a carriage in waiting. "Nothing! not the snap of my finger, not the flip of a copper. No, I won't think of her again. I have something better to do than that, I guess."  Luther returned to the deck where he found Captain Combings with his two companions in conference with the    68        NEVER AGAIN. captain of the steamboat, who announced that a collection had been taken up among the passengers and crew of the steamer, for relief of their immediate necessities as to clothing. Luther was at first inclined to refuse his portion, but his scruples were instantly overborne by the authority of quarter- deck opinion; and besides, an instinctive feeling of delicacy suggested that for him to stalid out alone in such a case would be a reflection upon the conduct of his companions who had no such scruples, and, more than himself, were in need of the money. The sum amounted to nearly two hundred dollars, which at Captain Combings' suggestion the captain of the steamboat divided equally between the four unfortunates. To this, Luther objected: he had saved his shirt, pantaloons and vest, and, more than all, his eel-skin pouch with its twenty-five dollars, while his companions had saved nothing 'but their shirts, and were indebted to the kindness of-some of the hands of the boat for the loan of clothes in which to go ashore and geta new fit out of their own. But the two. cap- tains insisted upon the equity of an equal division, so that Luther actually was a gainer by the accident ;--an omen, let us hope, of Fortune's favor in his future career.   CHAPTER IV.   Advantages of Dress-Search for a Boarding-House-A Sailor's Library -The Captain's Departure--Ah Awful Ordeal-Boarding-House Wit-A Spiritualistic Discussion-The Solitude of a City-A Present to Helen.   D;; T RESS, Luther, goes a great'ways with most people," said Captain Combings, as they stood in one of the common slop-shops in Washington Street. "It is with them just as it is with passengers in a packet-ship-they want only clean decks, a frech coat of paint and bright brass work; they never look to sce whether the rigging is chafed, the spars strained, or the pump-bolts worn half through. Now, looking at it in. that aspect-and by-the-bye, Luther, everything in this life has two or three aspects, and some things half-a-dozen or more- looking at it in that aspect, I say, dress is a regular imposi- tion; in fact, a downright swindle, the same as paying the seams over with tar before you've put in the oakum. But then, when you bowse, in the bow-line of observation, and luff up on t'other aspect, dress has its virtues. It looks very much like faith, as described by St. Paul, which is, as the apostle has it, 'the evidence of things not seen.' You see, when any thing or person is well dressed, there is a tendency --remarkably weak in many cases, it is true-to make every- thing correspond. A ship with new sails, fresh spars, well scraped and slushed, with plenty of paint and holly stones, is not so apt to get on shore, for the reason that there will be smarter seamanship on that craft; and just in that way, more than half-a-dozen times in the course of my life, I have been prevented doing or saying or thinking something dreadful mean by a clean shirt and a little blacking on my boots. So   70        NEVER AGAIN. you see, Luther, you want a smartish dress, for two reasons: first, for its effect upon the public, and next for its effect upon yourself. These things are common slop-shop affairs; they will do very well for Tom and Bill, here, and even for myself We are old battered craft, with no rake to our sticks, and the cut of our jibs is of no consequence; but you want something with a little more style in it. I think you had better go up into the town and order a dandy rig, square-cut and a-taunto." The Captain's proposition chimed in perfectly with the suggestions of Luther's vanity; so, bidding good-bye to Tom and Bill, who for a quarter of their share of the collection had obtained a complete suit of serviceable clothes, he set out under the guidance of the Captain in search of a tailor ot fashion.  The Captain's notions on the subject were not yery exalted, and Hudson Street readily supplied an artist who ledged his word of honor that he would have the required  uit ready in three days. From the tailor's they went to a sailor's boarding-house, / where the Captain was to remain for a few days, and where it was agreed that Luther also should stay until his new clothes / were finished, when he was to remove to a more genteel, / house, in a more fashionable quarter of the city. Captain Combings now went out to visit his business xfriends, and Luther was left alone. He had nothing to do u t-to wander about and see the sights. His walks, hcowever, re strictly confined to the wharves and by-streets. He had purchased a coarse P-jacket, which, as he. thought, answered very well for such excursions, but which would never do for Broadway and the more central parts of the town. Two or three times he stole up a cross street until he could see the carriages and omnibuses rushing by, and hear the roar of the great thoroughfare, but he did not venture nearer. He felt that it would be almost impolite to expose his P-jacket to the gaze of such a noted and fashionable street. All eyes would of course be directed upon him, and out of the thous- ands whom he would meet, not one would know that he had a beautiful new suit in the hands of the tailor. His curiosity   was strong, but so was his vanity, and Luther resisted the temptation to explore the magnificent mysteries upon which his imagination had so long dwelt. With a punctuality unusual in tailordom the clothes were finished. Luckily for Luther, Captain Combings was a sharp hand at a bargain, and half-a-dozen new shirts, as many pairs of stockings, a new hat, new boots, and a good second-hand valise, did not quite exhaust his portion of the collection taken up on board the steamboat. Luther was soon dressed, and after as close an examina- tion of himself as possible in the little broken bit of looking- glass that adorned his mantel-piece, he sallied out, accompa- nied by the Captain, in search of a new boarding-house. They paused before several doors. If the Captain's longitude when on nearing land had depended upon the accuracy with which he examined each house, his observations could not have been conducted with more apparent care. First he de- voted five minutes to a deliberate squint upwards from the opposite side of the way, as if he was especially desirous of taking the altitude of the cornice and chimney-tops. 'Next, he crossed the street, and as deliberately investigated the pro- fundities of the area, leaning over the railing and sniffing up the air, as if smelling for bilge-water. "But tell me, Captain," demanded Luther, "how can we know positively which house is a boarding-house?" "Know 'em!-don't you know you can tell a Frenchman from a John Bull without hearing his hail or seeing his hull? Well, how do you suppose it is done? Why, by something in the set of the sails, or the trim of the spars-something that perhaps you can't point out, but there it is,-aje ne sais quoi, as the French call it. It is just so with a boarding-house but, besides that, there is another and an infallible way of telling "em, and that is by the nose." "By the nose?" "Certainly, by the nose one knows 'erm. There is, in nine cases out of ten, about an American boarding-house an odor of boiled-coffee and ,ied beefsteaks. Mind, I don't say that     72         NE VER AGAIN. they always do boil their coffee and fry their beefsteaks, but there is a smell of it, and that smell is just as good a guide as the smell of fried onions in Malaga, or boiled cabbage in Hamburg. And more than that, there are other signs. Do you see the grease and dirt round the lock of that door? Well, there are night-keys used in that house, and I guess that some of them don't get into that key-hole without a good- deal of fumbling. It is rather a nice-looking house. Suppose that we try it? And Bleecker Street is a nice street, too. Not now, perhaps, of the highest brand in the fashionable world, but good, respectable second chop ; a No. 2 from fair to middling; by that I mean, Luther, there are worse streets in New York than Bleecker Street." They rang the bell, and after due delay the door was opened by a red-headed female Celt, with a dirty dusting- cloth in her hand. A rustling of skirts at the head of the stairs, and the sudden withdrawal of a white cap and pink ribbons over the upper rail, indicated that Miss De Belvoir Jones, the landlady, was occupying her customary coigne of vantage, whence she could descend in an overwhelming aval- anche of inflated petticoats, or retreating, disappear in the dim and nebulous recesses of " not-at-home." Having satisfied herself by eye and ear that the avalanche was the safe thing, Miss De Belvoir Jones came down upon the Captain and his companion in a perfect foam of silk lace and scolloped under-skirts. The Captain doffed his hat and bowed in the style of a merchant-trader striking topsails to a line-of-battle-ship. A smile of undisguised admiration at the round pleasant face, and the plump overdressed figure of Miss De Belvoir Jones illumined his honest countenance. "Hang me," he whispered to Luther, " if she doesn't remind me of old Ironsides at Rio, when she hung out all her signal flags for the Emperor of Brazil." "You say that your house is quite quiet?" demanded the Captain. *'Oh, perfectly quiet," replied Miss Jones; "we have never np noise in the neighborhood, unless it may be some-   times when they get drunk and fight in a tenement house in the rear; but then we don't mind that much." "Get used to it, eh? Well, there is not much harm in a row when you are not called upon to join in. How about the cats, Madam?" continued the Captain. "Cats, sir!" "Yes, and the rats?" "Rats, sir!" "Yes, but we wont inquire about any of the smaller ver- min. Those, Luther, are among the little evils of life that, as Montaigne says, one ought always to take for granted, and then you will never be disappointed. And your boarders, Madam," continued the Captain, turning to the lady; " they are all respectable people?" "Respectable people!" exclaimed Miss Jones, the color mounting to her face. The Captain hastened to correct himself. "Oh no, not respectable people; not at all respectable, but genteel-genteel people, I mean."                 . "Certainly, sir," replied Miss Jones, in amodified tone; "all my boarders are remarkably genteel-nice people, all of the Upper Ten, sir,-in fact I take none but the nicest sort of people. My first floor front is occupied by Mr. Stichen- the rich Mr. Stichen and wife, of the firm of Stichen & Hoyt, dealers in linens-manufactured linens." "Shirts!" ejaculated the Captain, nodding his head. "And my first floor back," continued Miss Jones, without replying to the Captain's coarse interpretation of her delicate euphuism, "is occupied by a distinguished literary man-J. Augustus Whoppers, author of the ' Song of the Spheres,' and editor of the New York Weekly Universe. You must have heard of him."  "Is he a hairy man?" demanded the Captain. "Hairy?" exclaimed Miss Jones. "Yes mam, about the face; because I once knew a fellow called Jack Whoppers; he wrote a song called ' Seven long years I courted a widow.' He made a voyage once with me    74        NE VER A GA IN. in the bark Kangaroo, and I can assure you, Miss Jones, that his whiskers were whoppers : they did justice to his name. I did hear that he had quit the sea and hired himself out to Bar- num to play the bearded Baboon from the Bango Islands." Miss Jones was puzzled. She could not tell whether to feel affronted Or not. The speaker's look of profound admitr ation she could not mistake. She felt the compliment all through-her stout little body ; but then such talk! What to make of it? It might, however, be the way of the sea, and all in earnest, but really at first it sounded very much like chaff. Her loquacity had received a check, however, and she had nothing more to say of her boarders. A bargain was finally concluded, by which Luther was to have a bed in' a little narrow attic room for four dollars and a half a week. The Captain having decided to go up the river that afternoon, Luther had but just time, before accompanying him to the boat, to write a letter, which his friend promised to deliver in person if he could possibly find the time to ride out to the Lake. On their way to the boat the Captain improved the oppor- tunity to impress his youthful companion with a due sense of the dangers of city life, and of the necessity of a constant watch over himself, if he wished to escape the many tempta- tions to which he would be exposed. "Above all things," said Captain Combings, "find something to do at once. Work! Luther, work! You may depend upon it there is nothing like work; nothing like it, not only for the good that it does, but for the evil that it prevents. There is nothing that the devil hates so much as good hard work. He don't so much object to a little occasional church-going and psalm- singing; he isn't afraid of a moderate stock of good principles; he doesn't object to a thorough knowledge of the ten com- mandments; and as for just an outside lick or two of respect- ability and gentility, why bless you, he loves it; but he has a mortal fear of honest work. He knows that he can always find 'some wicked thing for idle hands to do.' Now, there must be many people in such a city as this who would like to   employ such a good-looking and clever young fellow as you are. If we could have stayed together on the old sloop for a few voyages, I should have had time to look -around and find some nice place for you; but now you must do it for yourself. I hope you will have no diffi ulty. Look at the advertisements, and be sure to answer every one that you think will do. I shall see you soon again, and if nothing better turns up you can take a trip with me to sea;-that is, if I can get a command again from my old owners." The Captain held Luther by the hand, and looked kindly into his face. The young man could but half restrain a sob, while the older man's little gray eyes rolled. about in a bath bf liquid lustre, which only needed the thous'andth part of a drop more -from the fount of feeling to have been a tear. "Promise me, lad, that you wont run pn any of the shoals I told you of. Keep a good sober watch at the cat-heads, with a strong hand on the tiller, and you will make a good land-fall, I have no doubt. Come, cheer up; cheer up: you mustn't let your craft get down byghe I ead, and run under. If you find yourself getting into that trim, just overhaul and re-stow your ideas, and remember that Captain Combings expects to see you in a few weeks bowling along on an even keel, under easy canvas, and that it will just about kill him to find such a likely craft pitching and rolling and straining hull and spars under trysail, royals and flying-jib." The speakerjumped aboard as the gangway plank was pulled in. The boat started , he waved his hand and smiled, but it was with a heavy heart. He was sorry to part with Luther, but, besides that, he had other causes of sadness! First and foremost, he himself was now nearly penniless. He had no insurance upon his sloop, and there were no hopes of receiving anything from the owners of the steamboat which had caused the loss. To support himself, and an aged mother and a widowed sister, who were almost wholly dependent upon him, he saw that his only resource was the sea. But even in such employment he had good reason to suppose that, without the means of purchasing a share in a ship, he would find it impos- o  *76        NE jVER AGAIN. sible to obtain a command, and that hevould have to accept a subordinate post on some miserable craft. He was not pne, however; to suffer from an undue depression of spirits. JHis was naturally a sound, healthy temperament; and the cir- cumstances of his life--his early experience of hard work and hard fare-his struggles on the world of waters, both with the fierce moral elements that' go down to the sea in ships, and with the still fiercer natural elements which so often pre- vent their return -his varied adventures and misadventures by flood and field, had served to develop in him, both men- tally and physically, a high degree of manhood. His sensi- bilities were, like his- muscles, round, and full, and strong- easily excited by proper and proportionate forces, but not convulsed by pin-scratches and flea-bites. He had, moreover, a good stock of sound philosophy, which he had mainly acquired from his library of half-a-dozen books; not a grand collection, but then it must be recollected that among them were Shakespeare, Montaigne, and Plutarch, and that the Captain had spent many an hour of ocean solitude over them until he had got them almost by heart. Luther lingered on the wharf until the steamboat had passed out of sight. The sun had just gone down behind the heights of Bergen, and the darkness of twilight was drawing, over the scene; but a brighter sun had just set in Luther's mental horizon, and a deeper darkness was drawing over heart and brain-the darkness of utter loneliness!"Never mind,; my dear boy; your experience may hardly warrant the conviction, yet it is nevertheless true that, in the world'of Sentiment as in the world of physics, the night can't lasts always-in time the sun will rise and light will come." With his valise in hand and a small bundle of odd lug- gage under hisg arm, Luther bid adieu to the landlord of the sailor's boarding-house, and, threading the back streets, sought his new home. Making his way up to his little dingy room in the attic, by the aid of a lingering ray of twilight he ar-   NE VE ER- A GAINV. ranged! his effects, smoothed his hair, retied his cravat, and otherwise prepared his person for the momentous and trying ordeal of the tea-table. The tea-bell rang. With a hesitating step and a fluttering heart, he descended the stairs. It would be difficult to find anything in the history of young America out of which to manufacture a comparison that would heighten the reader's conception of the .tumult of feelingswith which Luther entered the room. What conceiv- able event shall we select? Is it a presentation to the Mayor of the great city of New York?--oh most modest of citizens! Be dac! Pat Rooney, only three weeks from the bogs of IBalli- nagora, will take you up and introduce you to him and stir him up like hot porridge, and if there is a bashful or embar- rassed'man in the company you may safely bet that it will be the Mayor himself.  Is it an introduction to the Governor? I think I see You -oh young man of little reverence for potemtwes and powders! A gracious smile on your placid countenance, a subdued swagger in your gait, as you condescendingly seize and shake his Excellency's hesitating flipper. Is it a step higher?-would you visit the White House? Ah! there is Pat Rooney's cousin, Tim Doolan, who came over this time two years, long enough to become an American citizen to the back bone and a member of Congress to boot -he can help you, he can put, you on easy terms at once j and besides, as Tim says, isn't the poor devil in the presi- dential, chair a man and a brother; you couldn't ask more nor that of a nigger, let along a democratic republican and gintleman. No, we must go abroad for our comparison, to Europe, and above all to England, where the organ of reverence is more assiduously cultivated, and where, a more rigid tabooism gives a wonderful exaltation to the idols of snobdom. "Will my daughter, .when presented,-have a good opportunity of seeing her Majesty?" inquired an American mother of her friend-a lovely and accomplished Marchioness, who had  78         NEVER AGAINz. kindly consented to map out the young'lady's course throug the rocks and shoals of court etiquette and costume into th haven-heaven we might say-of royalty. "Oh! yes, if sh dare," replied the lady, dropping her voice to the lowes contralto of reverential awe, and with a dubitating emphasic upon the word dare-" if she dare raise her eyes to he: Majesty, she may see her." The unabashed girl not only raised her eyes, and very lovely eyes too, but in her anxiety to get a good look at her Majesty she forgot one of the pre scribed courtesies to satellite royalties, whereupon with an aplomb that excited the wonder of some old courtiers, she coolly retraced her steps and deliberately paid the proper compliment. Now, suppose that instead of an irreverent re- publican it had been Lady Grace, or Lady Blanche. Ah! now we begin to get within sight of a comparison. A lovely, well-trained English girl of rank, on her first presentation at Court-determined to go through withit; yet trembling, awe- struck, not "daring to raise her eyes to Majesty:" there we have it! the exact counterpart in feeling to Luther, as he entered the dingy-looking, greasy-smelling dining-room, fur- nished with a grim horse-hair sofa, and a long, black mahogany table, around which were seated half-a-dozen women in divers stages of age and ugliness. A slight relief, however, to the dismal scene was given by a  glimpse through the folding doors of a stout, rather dumpy, but neatly-dressed and pleasant looking woman, who, seated at an open piano, and carelessly touching the keys, was humming in the undertones of a rich contralto voice occasional bars of music made famous by "I wish Mrs. Stichen would give us 'Jim along Josey,' or 'Who's dat knocking at de door,'" said one of- the ladies at the tea-table; "I can't bear those stupid Italian tunes." "Oh, Miss Billings, how can you say so? I think Italian tunes are lovely. I enjoy the opera so much," exclaimed her opposite neighbor. "Tell, so do 'I, when they are sung by a real prima donna; but, to tell you the truth, Mrs. Simmons, I :don't like the   IVE VER AGA IV.         79 woman, she's stuck up, don't have nothing to say to nobody; and sings and reads poetry all the day long. She's got some voice, but I don't like her, and she can't sing anything to suit me." A boarding-house tea almost immediately succeeding a hearty dinner has seldom any great attractions for the male sex, and no men had as yet arrived, with the exception of Mr. Whoppers, who sauntered in with an abstracted air; holding in his hand several strips of printed matter intended for the columns of the New York Universe. A short, pale-faced man was Mr. Whoppers, with sandy hair, and an enormous strag- gling mustache, which he occasionally stroked and pulled with his left hand, while with his right he made divers marks with a red chalk crayon on the strips of paper before him. His little ferret eyes furtively stealing around the table, notwith- standing his apparent preoccupation, showed him ready to pounce upon any item of news for his journal, or any crumb of admiration for himself. "You must find the life of an editor very laborious, Mr. Whoppers?" observed Mrs. Lasher, a lank woman of dubious age, cavernous gray eyes, neutral tint complexion, and of a decidedly spiritualistic turn of mind. "Very: behold the proof!" replied Mr. Whoppers, holding up the strips of paper. Mr. Whoppers was really a man of sense and information, but he had. a curious yet common theory of wit, that not unfrequently conveyed an erroneous impression of his talents. It differed greatly from the oft-quoted theory of Dr. Johnson. Mr. Whoppers' idea was that a pun, no matter how trite, absurd, or misplaced, was the highest form of wit. and that if he had really set himself ouj/ to cultivate the art, he could have made himself one of its greatest-masters ; and it is by no means clear that his vanity misled him. He lad some fancy, a good knowledge of words, and his memory was well stocked with the fag ends of poetry and all kinds of quo- table quips and quiddities, and it is well -known that in no sort of mental exercise is the adage ",practice makes perfect"   ivjC y VLPC ^rAUJA'V. more applicable. A regular punster, Ach we are far fron, accusing Mr. Whoppers of being, snaps at a verbal resew. blance as a trained poodle snaps at, a cracker on his nose-  with similar skill and with equal success. There would be no great harm in him if, when he has caught one, he did not invariably rear himself up and paw the air for more. "HaJ ha!-very good!' exclaimed Mr. Stichen, a fat little man who waddled into the room at the moment,--his round black eyes twinkling with an expression of good- humored self-complacency and admiration of his friend Whop- pers, over a pair of cherry-red cheeks, half concealed by the whitest and stiffest of shirt collars. "Ha! ha!-very good! Prpof, ladies I you see, proof! Ha! ha! very good indeed ha. ha! Whoppers, you are a wit-you are the wittiest man I know of, without excepting Blithers, of our club, and he stutters out sometimes such capital things." "Mr. Stichen," exclaimed Mr. Wholpers, eyeing with af- fected sternness the little gentleman as he dropped into his seat at the table,-" this is a proof, but I shall have to give you a re-proof if you flatter me so grossly." "Ha! ha!-he! he!-good again ; proof, reproof; ha! ha! very good. Why, Mrs. Lasher, the spirits themselves couldn't do better than that." "I beg your pardon," interrupted Mr. Whoppers; "the spirits, if they are good for anything, would readily come up] to fourth proof." "He! he!-ha! ha!-good, very good," sputtered the little dealer in manufactured linens, with his mouth full of hot tea, a  drop the wrong way converting the spasm of admira- tion into a laryngeal convulsion that had to be coughed out with averted head into the depths of a snowy and voluminous handkerchief. "You-must exquse me, ladies," exclaimed Mr. Stichen, as he recovered his breath; "but between Mr. Whoppers' wit and a  drop"- "Oh drop that," interrupted Mr. Whoppers; "we all take a I drop too much sometimes, but it is not best to say anything * . i   NE VER AGAIN.          81 about it before the ladie ; and as for coughing, you'll have a worse fit of 'coffin' than that before long." This last witticism did not seem to be quite so palatable to Mr. Stichen, so that between suspended breath and sus- pended admiration, the lone, lank woman was able to resume the conversation. "Mr. Stichen has made an allusion to the inhabitants of the spirit world," said Mrs. Lasher, in a tone profoundly in- dicative'of a stern belief in the supernatural; "I would ob- serve that the denizensi of the supernal spheres can do somer thing better than to make poor puns." "Certainly," replied Mr. Whoppers, with a polite nod and a vigorous pull at his mustache; "I have no doubt that with their advantages and& in their position they ought to be able, -they ought to be compelled--to make good ones. In fact, I have no doubt that all dull spirits are pun-ished in that way. -They are required to make puns, and I think that if you, Mrs. Lasher, will ask for a communication on that sub- ject, especially from any of our deceased old-clothes-dealing brethren, you will find that when a pun ish irequired a good pun ish ment." "You may laugh, Mr. Whoppers, or rather, Mr. Stichen may laugh and you may scoff, but if you had attended the session last evening, you must have been convinced. You could not have resisted the evidence of the immediate pres- ence of some of the greatest spirits." "Fourth proof spirits," giggled Mr. Stichen, in a desper- ate attempt to glitter for a moment in a reflected flash of the great luminary, Mr. Whoppers. "You must have been convinced,] continued Mrs. Lasher; "we had the advantage of a medium who can communicate with the, highest spheres-: we had communications from Wash- ington and Franklin." "Can you favor us, Mrs. Lasher, with the exact words of Washington?" demanded a fat, round-faced man with a white neck-cloth-the Rev. Dr. Droney, whose talents, sadly over- looked in the distribution of clerical calls, had found a fitting 6   8 2        AN YVER AGAIN-. field in the half-constructed-heavily-mortgaged-church-beg. ging business. "Can you favor us with his exact words?--I have always had a great respect for Washington. I believe that he was a very worthy, good man." "I can," replied Mrs. Lasher; "it was partly prose and partly poetry. He said: 'My experience in the spirit state convinces me more and more of the value of the Union. Let no demoniac or democratic,'-I forget now which it was, democratic or demoniac, but I think it was demoniac,--'let no demoniac hand ruthlessly tear asunder those ties cemented by the blood of the heroes and patriots of '76. "' Let your proud bird forever hold The awful tyrant-frightening scroll: E phtribis Uztnum, writ sobold, That kings may read fronm pole to pole."' "Very fine, very fine indeed," ejaculated the Doctor. Washington was unquestionably a lover of his country, and a very good, worthy man. I have always had a very great respect for his character. In fact, our country has hardly produced a  man whose course and conduct has more generally met my approval. I  hope you admire him, sir," suddenly turning to Luther, who, in obedience to an indication from Miss Jones, had taken a vacant chair by the side of the Doc- tor. "It is particularly incumbent, upon all young men to admire him, he set such a good example for youth. Never told lies, you know, and owned up about hacking the cherry tree, and all that you know." Thus directly addressed, Luther felt it his duty to say something in reply. "Yes sir," he stammered out, "I know that,-but-but "-and Luther hardly 'knew what to say-" but I did not know that Washington was a poet." "Ha!  Very true, sir, very true," and Dr. Droney looked with an air of stern inquiry towards the lone, lank expounder of things spiritual. "Not in this world," replied Mrs. Lasher, "but in the supernal spheres the faculties of the mind receive a higher development. Washington could not write such poetry, could   NE VER AGAIN.          8, not, perhaps, write poetry at all when living; but now he coul1 write a dozen volumes as good as that." "Perhaps," exclaimed Dr. Droney, his fat face flushin; with the glow of a luminous idea, " he had the assistance o Hamilton. You know Hamilton wrote all his letters an( papers in this life. What do you think, Mr. Whoppers? ye are a poet yourself, or at least you publish a good deal o poetry." Thus directly appealed to, Mr. Whoppers looked up fror his proofs. "' Allow me to correct you, Doctor,-a deal o good poetry. As to the Hamiltonian theory, I am oppose to it; and besides, Hamilton was not a poet. If Washingto -wrote those lines he mustihave had the assistance of a prc fessed poet--Shakespeare perhaps, or Milton; they soun  Miltonious."  - l V "But what about Franklin?" continued Mr. Whopper! turning to Mrs. Lasher. "As a member of the editorial fro ternity I am more interested in the opinions of Franklin tha of any one else. I hope Franklin did not belie his name-h opened his mind frankly--eh?" "Oh, that is, what I wanted to tell you," replied Mr. Lasher. "It has always seemed to me, Mr. Whoppers, tho you have never taken a sufficiently high view of the dutie and responsibilities of editorship. Picking up items of ever: day news for the public, and writing stories and tales for th vulgar, is a desecration and a degradation. Hear what FranI lin said last night. He said: ' If there is anything for whic I regret having left the world, it is the enormous' journalisti development which has since taken place. The newspape is destined to be the highest main-spring of mundane exis I ence.' What do you think of that, Mr. Whoppers?" "Are you sure that he said the ' highest main-spring c mundane existence?"' demanded Mr. Whoppers; cocking hi eye at Mr. Stichen in a way that set the little gentleman ol into a premature giggle.        ' "Certainly, the very highest main-spring." "Well, then," replied Mr. Whoppers, "I can only say th;   f 84        XNEVE:'R AGAIN. I think the old gentleman must have been, in the main, decidedly sprung himself, or else that he had not been prop- erly wound up ;" and gathering up his proofs, Mr. Whoppers, with becoming gravity, but not without a sly wink to Mr.. Stichen, bowed himself out of the room. The conversation not having any peculiar interest for Luther, he availed himself of the sensation attending Mr. Whoppers' parting mot to slip away from the table. He had been so long accustomed to bowls of fresh milk and bread, or slices of fried ham with eggs for his supper, that a cup of wishy-washy tea and a thin slice of bread with questionable butter could hardly produce any great elevation of Ipirits, and so to escape the companionship of his own sad thoughts, as well as to gratify curiosity, he hurried out into Broadway. The lamps were just lighted--the street was filled with a throng of rapidly-moving people--the roar of wheels almost deafened him. He felt excited and delighted, and yet every now and then there came over him such a feeling of loneli- ness--to be one of such a crowd and yet not know a soul in it-to have no one in such a large city who cared for him or for whom he cared! No one? Luther pondered the ques- tion, and the fair face of the young girl whom he had seen on the steamboat came up to his mental vision. Somehow, he did not feel so lonely when he thought of her. Not that he really cared anything about her, or even expected to see her again.  Oh! no; but then there was a kind of com- panionship in the thought of her. She seemed to go along with him and to loiter with him at the shop windows, and everything seemed in some way to assume an interest in con- nection with her. There was a richly-figured pink silk-how well it would become  her! There was a beautiful India shawl-how gracefully she would wear it! There was a show- case full of-common bijouterie-not a single article costly enough to present to her: if he could give her the whole case- ful, that perhaps would do.  But for a present-here in this jeweller's window is the thing: a diamond bracelet! Luther wondered whether the article was really worthy of being pre-   ANEVER AGAIN.          8 sented to her. The stones could not be paste, they were too beautiful and brilliant. He thought he would ask the price, and judge from the answer whether it would be the thing, if he were rich and going to make her a present. Cautiously pushing open the door, he, in a very modest tone, asked a man standing behind the show-case if he would have the goodness to tell him the price of the bracelet in the window. "A thousand dollars," replied the salesman, after eyeing Luther a moment. "Do you want to buy it?-will it suit you?" "No, sir; but I thank you for telling me," replied Luther humbly--feeling that the man had a just claim against him for damages in not fulfilling a contract to purchase, implied in his asking. "No, sir ; I only wanted to inquire the price." Little did the jeweller know how much pleasure his an- swer had given. A thousand dollars! Luther was delighted -he had been afraid that the answer would be four or five hundred. A thousand dollars 1! It was then pretty enough and costly enough to present to her. True, he had no expec- tation of ever seeing her again, much less of ever making her a present of any kind, but it was a comfort to know that she was in the same city, and that there was'a beautiful diamond bracelet ready for any one who might choose to give it to her. Oh Luther! you fickle young villain, was there nothing in that show-window that would do for Miss Deborah Doolittle? Luther went home, crept under the low slanting roof, into his hard, knobby, corn-husk bed, and dreamed of walking, with his pockets stuffed full of thousand-dollar bank notes, into a butcher's shop, where hung pieces of beef, fresh from Golconda, all studded with diamonds as large as lemons.   CHAPTER V. Seeking Work-Letter from the Captain-A Dog-Figit with a Moral-. The Hero of Corunna-Futile Efforts-A New Principle in Medicine -A Warning to Young Men in the Country-Pride Knocks Under. T   UTHER had now to set himself seriously to work soek- ing some employment,-not so pleasant a task as it had seemed when viewed from a distance. He had, however, no doubt as to its practicability, and under that delusion he wasted a week in looking about- the city and trying to make up his mind as to what situation he would be willing to take. The payment however of his first week's board bill, and the sud- den conviction that his small stock of money would not last forever, gave a fresh impulse to his determination. He looked over the newspapers and selected the advertisements which he thought applied to a case like his own. Some he answered by letter, others required a reply in person. Dressing every morning with the utmost care in his new suit, and taking his memorandum of the address, Luther would sally forth with the firmest resolve to have an interview with the preferred ad- vertiser, and close a bargain with him at once. But somehow, as he walked, his resolution began to give way-a thousand doubts and objections arose in his mind. There was some- thing in the advertisement that he did not like, or it was ques- tionable, on second thoughts, whether he could perform the duties required of him, or there was something in the nature of the business that he had neglected to consider. The re- sult was that his excursion generally ended in an examination of the outside of the office or warehouse, and a return to his own room, where, to his great astonishment, as well as disap- pointment, he never could find an answer to any of his written communications.   NE VEr AGAIN.           87 A second board bill gave a new fillip to his resolution, and ie made up his mind to no longer delay applying for, and se- curing, some situation. His first application threw a flood of light upon matters, in relation to which he had hitherto been entirely in the dark. "We are in no want of any one," was he prompt and rather rude answer to his inquiry. "I saw an advertisement in the Herald "- "True, but that was two days since ; we had fifty applica- tions the first day." Fifty applications! Astonishment held him dumb and motionless for a moment, and then a sense of shame sent the color to his cheek. He felt ashamed of his own dilatoriness, and ashamed, more than all, of having applied for a place already filled. He felt as guilty as if he had been caught try- ing to carry off some of the bales or barrels lying around, and, hastily making for the door, he rushed into the street. The ill success of his first effort deterred him from making another for several days. Visions of a seafaring life came over him. He thought of the ocean, as thousands)of imagi- native minds have thought and will think of it upon finding for the first time that their lofty fabrics of fancy have no solid foundation upon the land. With this idea, he 'visited all the shipping in port-strolled around the wharves, and spent hours in the various ship-yards. This was great waste of time, but it was certainly better than loitering in drinking-saloons, or hanging around ten-pin alleys or billiard-rooms. He also made a regular morning visit to Washington Square, and an evening seldom passed without repeating it. He could not sleep comfortably without passing and repassing the house a dozen times, occasionally stopping to listen to the sounds of the piano-to watch the shadows flitting by on the closed curtains, and now and then creeping up the front steps, and trying to peer into the parlor windows. Sometimes, for hours, he stood on the opposite side othe street, with his back to the park railing, endeavoring, in g- ination, to penetrate the mysteries of those illuminated rooms. Perfectly familiar with the castles of feudal and fairy land,   88         NEVER AGAIN. and with the palaces and caravansaries of Bagdad and Bas. sorah, Luther was utterly ignorant of the arrangements and furniture of a first-class residence in New York. His pran cing fancy consequently, when galloping into the front door of that particular house, lacked the curb of comparison, or even the check-rein of probability. His idea was that of a suite of rooms of interminable extent-ceiled with a mosaic of rubies,emeralds, and sapphires; hung with a curious col. posite of crystal mirrors, gobelin tapestry, and pictures by Raphael; carpeted with the fabrics of Persia, half a foot thick, and filled with furniture of solid gold. Through these rooms flitted continually a figure, the face -of which was that of Miss Ledgeral, as she appeared that night on ,the steam boat, but all the rest was brocade, diamonds, and little rglas slippers. From all this it will readily be seen by the astut reader, what a poor, weak, ignorant youngster we have hers He would hardly do for the herg  of a modern novel. True he has some book knowledg afrd plenty of brains, but he is so ridiculously lacking in savoir-faire. Sometimes, however these kind of fellows have a wonderful faculty of- learnin! rapidly. Let us hope that he will have a little common sens and knowledge of the world and its ways knocked into him in time. Again, after a few days of mortification and despondency, did Luther summon up a resolution to answer- another adver tisement, but there was something in his appearance that, in the absence of any letters of recommendation, induced a prompt refusal. He was now getting somewhat accustomed to such rebuffs, and his spirit began to rise. The combata tive instinct so essential to success of any kind began to stir within him. He determined to obtain a situation somehow by sheer persistence and pluck. In this state of mind he felt strongly supported by a note from Captain Combings, t whom he had written an account of his failure in his first at- tempt. "The world," wrote the Captain, " is very much lik a big dog I once knew in Corunna. It was a hot summer's afternoon, the citizens-men, women, and children-had just    NIE VER A GAIN.         89 got through their siestas, and w  e beginning to show them- selves on their balconies, all busy rubbing their eyes and roll- ing cigarettes. I was stretched out on three chairs, in the public room of a dirty posada, trying to smoke one of the nasty little paper thinris, when suddenly there was a terrible shouting. I rushed to the window, as did everybody else in town. a ( Elperro! El perro i ' Tle dog of all dogs-the most awful dog in all Spain--the dog that had killed his man more than once, and had whipped his bull more than a dozen times -had broken loose! It was cut-and-run with the half-a-dozen long-legged fellows in the street, and there was a terrible slamming of shop-doors and ground-floor windows. In a moment the street was cleared of every living thing except the dog-a monstrous yellow brute, as big as' a bull, that is, a small-sized bull; and one of my men-Bill Stebbins by name-a little chap about five feet high, but a sailor every inch of him. I saw by his weather roll that he had shipped a little botega, and hadn't got it very well stowed, but with all that, he was, for I a Jack-ashore,' in pretty good trim. The people on the balconies shouted to him to fly-save himself, or the dog would kill him. Bill couldn't understand them; he continued to work his way right up the centre of the street towards the dog. When he came within reach of my voice I hailed him by name, and told him to look sharp or the dog would be upon- him. ' Dog?' he cried, looking up, and see- ing the animal for the first time. 'Dog? dog be damned; is that all that these yellow-faced-lubbers are making such a fuss about?' At that moment the dog got sight of him, and with a deep growl of rage rushed to the attack. Bill grasped his tarpauling by its lining with his left hand, and threw him- self into a regular boxing attitude. The dog gave a dozen monstrous jumps down the street, and then one terrific bound directly at his throat. A shudder of excitement fairly shook the crowded balconies. As a senorifa said to me afterwards, 'it was delightful; we, all expected him to be torn instantly to pieces'; it was better than a bull-fight.' As the dog sprang   90        ANEVER AGAIN. into the air, Bill received him with his tarpaulin on his left hand, and at the same instant struck him an upward blow right under the lower jaw that knocked him completely over on to his back. 'First knock down for me,' shouted Bill. ' Time, you lubber!' And time it was ; for the dog, recover- ing his feet, instantly made another spring. Again the tar- paulin was thrust at his mouth, and another blow'right under his jaw given with still more force, turned him once more over on to his back with his big paws quivering in the air. Before he could recover himself Bill rushed at him, and with his foot gave him a heavy stern-lifter. (There, take that, you lubber,' he shouted; 'foul is fair in a dog-fight.' This ,last indignity was too much for Senor Pero. He got himself on to his legs, rushed up the street amid the shouting and hoot- ing of the people, and slunk into his kennel. I guess if you. had asked thiat evening the name of the hero of Corunna, lyou couldn't have found a beggar in town who would have thought -of Sir John Moore. Now the world, Luther, is just like'that big yellow dog. If you stand up to it square and true, strike out strong and hearty, knock it down, and especially if you can contrive to give it a good kick or two after it is down, it will fetch and carry for you like a trained poodle; but if you get frightened, and let it once get you under, you may be sure it will worry you." ^e    *e     *           ;  "Where there's a will there's a way!" exclaimed Luther. Alas! What a pity that so many proverbs should be thorough hybrids-half truth and half falsehood. The adage, how- ever, encouraged him, and he devoted himself in earnest to his task. Dry goods shops and groceries, wholesale and re- tail jobbers, shipping merchants, brokers of every class, with ship-chandlers and slop-shops-all were successively applied to, but in all cases he was either too late, or tho old, or too young, or too something-or-other, for the place. He called at the post-office and found a long and affec- tionate letter from his mother. She had heard of the- acci- dent on the river, and of the lucky escape of the crew of the   NEVER AGAIN.           9I sloop. Her own health was worse, and John's temper and manner more surly and disagreeable than ever, but shevdid ;not care for anything, she said, so long as her darling Luther was doing well. Captain Combings had, according to his prom- ise, paid her a visit. His. account had encouraged her hopes of her dear boy's ultimate success, and shre congratulated hiln upon his prospects, which she had great confidence had already become realities. Luther could not answer this letter-he could not tell her of the miserable failure that had attended all his efforts. In fact he could hardly bear to read it the second time, it sounded so much like mockery of his crude plans and foolish hopes. His. money was all gone, and there was a week's board due. No criminal condemned to the gallows ever endured a week of greater mental torture. He could not eat, not alone because he had no appetite, but because he felt that every mouthful was a theft-a fraud upon his confiding landlady. He could not sleep, or if ihe did, it was to dream of a terrible hob-goblin clothed in a dress of dirty bank-notes, with 'a tail fashioned like that of a kite Out of a long string of unpaid bills, and shaking an empty purse as he danced upon his la- boring breast. He began to fall off in flesh, the bloom of high health was beginning to fade from his cheek. The Rev. Dr. Droney eyed him. suspiciously, and finally \ took it upon himself to advise him not to be led into tempta- tion, but to keep the example of that good, worthy man, Washington, ever before him. "Look at Proverbs, chap. i. ver. Io;, young man, and let the text sink into your heart." Mrs. Lasher advised him to try homoeopathy, especially when she found, upon inquiry, that he had not slept much for two or three nights. "Caffein -is the thing-one drop in a tumbler of water, and take a teaspoonful every half hour. It workls like a charm. rWhy, I was very wakeful the other night, and I had to take nearly a whole tumbler full, but towards morning it put me into such a sound sleep I didn't hear the breakfast bell." "Ah, but I have. the remedy," interposed Mr. Stichen.   92         NEVER AGAIN. "Some nasty allopathic drug, I suppose," said Mrs Lasher. "No, mine is an external application," replied Mr Stiche "But not being able to go to sleep iAiternal," retorted Mrs. Lasher. "Just so," said Mr. Stichen, " that's my principle exactly -all internal diseases ought to be treated externally, and all external diseases internally." "Well, there is something in that," rejoined Mrs. Lasher; "it sounds reasonable, and besides, it coincides with what Doctor Quackenhummer said to me at our last biological soirCe. You don't know the doctor, do you? Well, you ought to; he is so lucid, only he don't speak English very plainly. He was at first a disciple of Hahnemann, but he has got way beyond his master. He said to me: 'Madame, de grand principe of dat great man, similia .simnilibus, is von of de finest tings of de human mind, but I have make von discoGury ten tousand times more fine, 'tis vat I call de vice-varsity of na- ture.' Now, that agrees with what you say of the externality of internalisms, and the internalism of externalities. But what is your remedy in cases when the cerebellum evinces a decided repugnance to the somnific state?" "Nothing more simple, madam; shirts is the thing." "Shirts!" "Yes, ma'am, shirts. I have a, dozen shirts lying by my bedside. When I can't sleep I hop out of bed and change my shirt; and I do that every half hour, until I either fall asleep or go through the whole dozen." "Very remarkable and original!" exclaimed Dr. Droney. "Neither one nor the other," said Mr. Whoppers, who had just entered the room. "Stichen hops out of bed and hops into a fresh shirt: now it is, neither wonderful or new that hops should produce sleep." Despite these various prescriptions, Luther grew worse; an explanation could not be long delayed; it was a relief when it came. The actual is seldom so distressing or so diffi- cult to bear as fancy represents it.    NEVER   GVAI.         93 His good-natured landlady took it much more quietly than he had expected. She had becorime used to such things, and this was only one week's board, besides youth andgood looks counted for something on the credit side in the books of dressy,fussy, but tender-hearted Miss de Belvoir Jones. With a promise to pay her as soon as he could get the money, he. took his carpet-bag 'in his hand and walked into the street. Penniless!-friendless!-homeless!-he knew not which way to direct his steps. Instinctively he turned up into Broadway, and stood for a while gazing on the stream of life as it rolled by. And what more striking object of con- templation than the active, bustling, hustling crowd of people thronging the great thoroughfare of a great city? "As with like haste to several ways they run, Some to undo, and some to be uridone." 'Abstract yourself, and drop for a moment a sense of your own immediate relations, whatever they may be, to the crowd, -the Scene is funny and grotesque, or mean and pitiable, or grand and solemn-one or'all, as you may choose to view it. What a grand flux and reflux of life, qr what a pitiful whirl of miserable individualities-what a bjubbling and seething of diyers contemptible interests and motives, or what a strik- ing display of excited and elevated activities! and from all what a strong conviction arises of a great natural law, or laws, in obedience to which the apparently independent mem- bers of the confused mass move and halt, and talk, and ges- ticulate and laugh and cry, and tumble down and pick them- selves up again, and repeat, over and over, in exactly the same proportion, the accidents, the motions, the looks, the feelings and the sentiments of yesterday and to-morrow. As the crowd rolled by, many directed their eyes towards him-some with a slight expression of surprise or curiosity; but none stopped to ask him a question or to offer any assist- ance. All seemed to be too busy or too happy to heed him. A feeling of bitterness arose in his heart, but his better judg- ment checked it, though not without effort. How could they   "         NEVER AGAIN. know his distress, and if they did, were there not other objects better deserving their compassion?.- Besides, how did he know that under that gay exterior there were not hearts acl. ing with deeper griefs than his own? But what to do?-lwhich way to turn?-where to go? Alas! how many young men have been in a similar condition, and without Luther's excuses? Deluded by a false estimate of city life, allured from perhaps pleasant homes or from set- tled situations in the country by ridiculous notions'of the ease and certainty with which fortune is won in town, they expect, with feeble will, small capacity for work, and no spec. ial talent, to succeed in a struggle which taxes the energies of the best-endowed for merely a bare existence.  And how many, too, having once made the mistake, instead of returning to the abundant work of the country, hold on to the very verge of despair, supported only by -"An esperan-ce so obstinately strong !kht doth invert the attest of eyes and ears." Corrupted anrd enfeebled by the baser influences of city life, they surrender energy and will to -"Hope, the fawining traitor of the mind Which, while it cozzens with a color'd friendship, Robs us of our best virtue-resolution." If, however, utterly dissatisfied with home, where, as Petnr chio says, "but small expc rience grows," our country youth feel " the wind that scatters young men through the world," too strongly to be resisted; better they set their sails for a far western course, and seek for newer fields. Padua is as old as " old Verona," and as over-filled with starving people. Luther thought of his fair acquaintance of the steamboat, --no unfrequent thought with him,-and of the firm of Ledg- eral, Shippen &  Co. "No! never!" he exclaimed. "(I have said it, and I will stick to it!"  Pride, false and foolish as it most always is, gave temporary vigor to his resolution, and he instantly closed his heart to the suggestion. With equal firmness he rejected the impulse to return L4   NVEER AGAIN.   '       95 to his mother. He knew that he could easily beg a passage up the river on some, sloop, or if he found any difficulty in doing so, that he could make the journey on foot in a couple of days. But he could not reconcile- himself to the idea of returning to his brother's rule, and still less of announcing in person to his mother the failure of his plans. Instinctively his steps turned towards the sailor boarding- house in West Street, where, with Captain Combings, he had at first lodged. The landlord received him very graciously, and kipdly insisted that he should again take up his residence with him, although Luther frankly owned that his pockets were empty, and that he knew not when they would be replen- ished. He gladly accepted the landlord's offer of a bed, re- solving that he would pick up his meals out of the house, or go without eating, sooner than trench further upon the worthy man's hospitality. During the night a brilliant idea occurred to him. He would canvass, personally, the whole business portion of the' city. He would inquire and press his inquiries with all propet persistence, at every store, shop, and office. Something must come of it according to the doctrine of chances. He arose with a light heart, but, unluckily, with a light stomach too. The sun was shining brightly, his level rays lifting the mist-veils from the surface of the rive, 'and pack- ing them away amid the other finery of nature in upper cloud- land. 'A row of huge black ships, stretched up and down on either hand, their well slushed spars and blackened cordage gleaming in the morning light in all the glistening glories of fresh coats of grease, tar, and black paint. The streets and bordering quays began to be alive with a bustling crowd of sailors, stevedores, riggers, porters, draymen and custom- house officers. Everything looked lively, cheerful, and in- spiriting. Luther dressed himself carefully, ate a piece of ship-bis- cuit for his breakfast, and began his preambulations in one of the principal business streets. He called at every door on one side of the street, but with no success. Somewhat dis-    96        NEVER AGAIN. heartened he took the other side, and went through .it in like manner. The answer was invariably a prompt negative. Faint and hungry he stepped into two or three bar-rooms, and, pretending to look at the papers, siddled up to the bar, and helped himself to small pieces of cracker and cheese placed there for the bibulous customers. It was not a very wrcked'. thing to do, but it was a meanness that, a week ago, he would have scouted as impossible. Pinching poverty had begun its demoralizing work. More than a hundred places he called at that day. The next day he arose and began again; but with no bet- ter fortune. The next day and the next went in the same way, and with them went all confidence in the success of his scheme. Every possible mode of earning a livelihood seemed to be closed against him. He stopped at the door of a blacksmith's shop: the sparks were flying merrily from a piece of iron on the anvil; as it cooled, the vigorous blows of the smith subsided into a gentle tapping; until at length he rested his hammer upon the anvil, and looked up. "Do you want any one to blow and strike?" .demanded Luther. "Well, I don't know," replied the smith; "what kind of a chap is he?" "I want the situation myself," said Luther. "You!" exclaimed the man with a laugh. "No, I guess we don't want any such slick-looking, nicely-dressed fellows as you. A tack hammer would be better for you than a sledge, I expect. A blacksmith's shop ain't no place for young dandies; you ought to be behind a counter selling rib- bons and tape--you had." Luther turned away without another word. He was faint from want of something to eat. He went on a block or two, when he spied in the gutter the half of a ship-biscuit. He looked around cautiously: no one whom he could see was observing him, and stooping, he quickly picked up the frag- ment, 'and, wrapping it in his handkerchief, thrust it into   NEVER AGAIN.          97 his pocket. He again looked around, when he perceived that from the window of a neighboring counting-room his motions had been observed by a large, dressy, good-looking young man, who made a gesture indicating a desire to speak with him. Luther was too much ashamed and confused to heed him, and turning away he hurried rapidly along the street. As reflection came to him, he was sorry that he had not re- plied to the inviting gesture, but it was too late. Who. of us have not felt at times that, by some sudden act of caprice, passion, or negligence, -we have turned a sharp corner of des- tiny, and forever left behind us an avenue that might have led to something-a something which a vanity will, seldom allow fancy to paint otherwise than in very brilliant and enchanting colors? Alas! for those might-have-been conditions-those if-I-had-only-done-so-,and-so possibilities with which we have all felt and still feel ourselves so closely surrounded. Luther's pride was now pretty well subdued, and during a long and wakeful night he pondered the propriety of mak- ing an application to the father of his young steanrboat acquaintance. ' Upon duly considering the matter he concluded that it would not be useful for him to apply in person. Mr. Ledgeral would hardly recollect him, and if he did, he would not be likely to feel, Luther thought, specially prompted by the remembrance to any very vigorous action in his behalf. It would be best, then, to make the application in writing. That. would be some little testimony to his abilities, and be more. likely to ensure some attention-if not from the great man himself, at least from his subordinates or deputies. As soon as it was light, he arose and proceeded to draft a letter in pencil upon the back of an old theatre bill, but after altering and realtering it in almost every line, he suddenly changed his mind, and decided to write to -the young lady herself. Once on the inclined plane of self-humiliation, hc was not one to stop short of the bottom. But if writing to the father was difficult, writing to the daughter was next door to an impossibility. Having, however, once conceived the 7   98          NE VE R AGAIN. idea, he was determined to carry it out. Repeated trials and repeated failures did not deter him. He knew that he had the ability to write a fitting note. A dim consciousness of the artistic instinct-that instinct that hunts out, through the mazes of words or the mazes of form   and ,polor, the exact and proper expression-stirred within him. He felt that, if lie only worked long enough and hard enough, he should at length succeed in so weighing every word and phrase, and o qualifying and arranging them, that his note should be artis- tically, whatever its result, just the thing. If he starved to death, he would starve with the conviction that -he had not written a ridiculous and feeble note to her. Luther thought of the enraged artist, who, having worked for a long time in vain on a picture, threw his brush full of paint at the canvas, and at once achieved the desired effect. "Decidedly," he exclaimed aloud, " the, man of colors has an advantage over the artist in words. I might serve my paper as my great namesake did the devil, and throw a full inkstand without any chance of hitting the right expression. There, that will do-it must do!" and wearily he read over, for the fiftieth time, the amended and rewritten and trans- formed draft: "Iiss Ledgeral will undoubtedly recollect an incident which occur- red on thWHudson some six weeks since: the running down and sinking of a sloop by the steamboat on which Miss Ledgeral was a passenger. She will, perhaps, also recollect a person who was rescued from the sinking sloop, and whom she honored with a few words of conversation, and an offer of assistance in case of need. Friendless, homeless, penniless, and utterly dispirited at the ill-success attending every effort to procure em. ployment, Luther Lansdale ventures to remind Miss Ledgeral of her kind offer, and to beg her influence with the head of the firm of Ledgeral, Shippen & Co., to which firm he is going to apply for employment of some kind. He knows, from his recent disheartening but conclusive ex- perience, the futility of making any such application unless Miss Ledg- eral exerts her influence in his favor. He knows, however, his ability to make himself in time useful in various ways, and his willingness to make the- attempt in any situation, however humble, and however laborious, and he knows, above all things, his determination to do no dishonor to Miss Ledgeral's recommendation.   NE VER  AGAIN.         99 "Hoping that Miss Ledgeral will recall to mind her earnest kind- ness of tone and manner at the time of the accident, and that, however uninterested she may now feel, and however indisposed to take any notice of this note, she will not deem it wholly unwarranted or presump- tuous, the writer begs leave to subscribe himself "Her very, humble servant,  Luther having carefully copied his letter in his best hand, on a sheet of paper borrowed from his landlord, set out to deliver it in person. Arrived at Washington Square, his courage failed him. He passed and repassed the-house a dozen times-walked around the square repeatedly, and took. short excursions up the streets leading into it. He had eaten nothing for two days but; the piece of cracker he had picked up in the gutter. He felt very faint by turns, and soon grew very tired. Two or three times he had to stop and hold on to the park railings, pretending the while to be very much in- terested in the gambols of the- children who were at play within. At length, utterly exhausted, he seated himself upon the stone foundation of the iron railing. His heart was cold and as heavy as lead. He could feel each one of its feeble "and reluctant pulsations. His head ached and throbbed with an occasional swimming sensation, as if about to whirl itself round and sail away from his shoulders. Suddenly he started to his feet.  His mental hesita- tion was at an end. Imagination had done her worst. He might die perhaps of starvation, but he would not be fright- ened to death by the vague terrors of his own vagabond fancy. He crossed the street, ascended the steps, and rang the bell.     .  The door was opened by an old colored man, in a white neck-cloth and a glossy and rather voluminous suit of black. An embodiment of so much African dignity would have been overwhelming, had it not been modified by a benignant smile and an impressivo e urtly courteousness of manner. "Is Miss Ledgeral at home?" demanded Luther. "Miss Ledge al,sar! Miss -Ledgeral am gwine out ob town wid her mudder," replied the servant ;" but," he added,   100    oEVo7r ER AGA IN. seeing Luther's look of dismay, and the increasing pallor of his cheek, "Miss Helen Ledgeral is at home; mabbe she'll attend to any communercation." "Miss Helen Ledgeral!"Here was a dilemma. Was it Miss Helen Ledgeral that he- wanted? How stupid in him not to think that she might have sisters, and that in writing to a young lady it was very necessary to know her name. The negro held the door invitingly open, and almost unconsciously Luther entered the hall. "I don't know-that is, am not sure," he stammered out, at the same time grasping the 'hat-stand to steady himself, "but I -thought-that is, I have a letter for a young lady that was on the steamboat "-- "Look 'ere, young man," exclaimed the old negro, sud- denly assuming a very stern tone, "I tink you tink dis pussan a fool, eh? You shake your head 'No,' den you make a great mistake to tink dis house am a steamboat--a mistake which is excusible only upon de supposishum dat you have gotten de steam up too high here, sar!" and the old fellow frowned and touched his forehead with his finger emphati- cally. Luther tried to make some reply, but his tongue failed him, he could only extend his hand with the letter. At that instant a lithe female figure darted from the parlor, crossed the hall, and bounded up the stairs, two steps at aT time, in the very watonness of youthful agility. There was a mist creeping over Luther's eyes, and the gaslight in the hall was not burning very brightly, but he recognized at a glance the cloud of golden ringlets which he had seen but once before, and then only in curl papers. Half way up the stairs the young girl paused, and turned upon hearing the voices at the door. "What is that, Joseph?-a parcel for me?" "No, Miss Helen, 'tis a young man dat has got a -letter for somebody in a steamboat. But-oh lor! what is de mat- ter!" exclaimed Joseph, as Luther sank senseless to the floor.   CHAPTER VI.

LEDGE'RAL sat in his study, the very impersona- tion of genteel respectability. There were the two or three carved book-cases, filled with handsomely-bound vol- umes; there was the walnut cloth-covered table, loaded with the largest kind of bronze ink-stand and pen-rack, besides portfolio, manuscripts, maps, engravings, and books of refer- ence; there were the two inevitable globes, handsomely mounted on rosewood stands; there were the red and green curtains, and the green and red carpet-small pattern, rich, but not gaudy-the genuine library tone; there were a couple of vases of porcelain, not beautiful, but valuable from having once belonged to the dowager-duchess of Sax-Grman- ingen, and the curious circumstances under which they came into the, possession of their owner; and over the mantel- piece there were several small pictures-regular gems of the old masters--picked up by the greatest good luck, twenty years ago, out of some old neglected rubbish in a shop just around the corner of the first street to the right as you come out of the museum of Dresden; one by Raphael-a female with a simper of excessive purity on her face, and an un- 4 dressed infant in her arms-was evidently a Madonna and child; in fact, no one ever disputed its being a Madonna and child. Another was a Magdalen by Guido. Guido did occa- sionally paint Magdalens, you know, and this is one of them; and a third is just as clearly a Carlo Dolci. No one could    doubt, with that charming lilac tint: every picture he ever painted has it, you know.          ' Amid his books and pictures, in a capacious, patent ellip. tical, spring-bottomed, morocco-covered arm-chair, sat Mr. Ledgeral, the picture of elegant respectability, or if not a pic- ture, a very pretty study for a picture of that estimable quali- ty, could he have been seen and sketched by some artist of an allegoric turn of mind. Down in his counting-room, in Burling Slip, or in the bank-parlor in Wall Street, the' study would have been one simply of moneyed respectability. He would hardly have been content to sit for that. He would have felt that old Rhindergelt would do as well, or better, especially as old Rhindergelt had the most money, and was likely to have more, "having never," as he told Mr. Ledgeral one day, "wasted a dollar on a potry-book, a picter, a stat- ute, or a mosaic." Lolling in his carriage, perhaps with Madame at his side, half buried in an overflowing flood of silk flounces; coach- man and footman in dark blue; crest on harness and panel, and a pair of thoroughbreds stepping as if playfully trying to paw at their pole-straps; or, seated at his own dinner-fable, surrounded by all the blazing glories of burnished silver, bohemian glass, flowers, fruit, and spun sugar, the picture would have been one of great elegance, it is true, but largely of mere ostentatious and fashionable respectability. Now Mr. Ledgeral had too much ambition for mere moneyed respecta- bility, too much taste and mental cultivation for mere fashion- able respectability. , Foreign travel, some knowledge of the world, a  little desultory reading, combined with that kind of imperfect half-and-half education that teaches a man a good deal, but that utterly prevents him from knowing how much he don't know, had had the customary and legitimate effect, and generated a  creditable amount of dogmatic dilettanteism, and a  decided inclination towards an 'elevated, elegant, cul- tured respectability. And that was the picture he would have made had Hicks, or Baker, or Huntingdor been at hand, as he sat amid his books, papers,' and pictures, in his patent elliptical, spring-bottomed, morroco-covered arm-chair.   NE VE'R A GAIN.        103 Afore than twenty years had passed since we first saw him at Baden, but notwithstanding those years had had their cares and troubles and labors, he was still comparatively a young- looking man-a little more portliness, a few wrinkles, and a sparsity of hair on the crown, that the most assiduous train- ing of the side locks could hardly conceal, were almost the only marks that he exhibited to his casual acquaintances of his manful contest with Time. No, not the only marks. There were those impertinent white hairs which will intrude themselves so wonderfully early into the most luxuriant whis- kers, and which, when there is plenty of red in the complexion, are not, perhaps, unbecoming. These he made no effort to conceal, contrary to the advice of Mr. Whoppers, who was always ready with his advice, no matter how delicate the sub- ject. "Why don't you dye?" said that gentleman to him one day. "I would, if I were you. You know it, is only weak and demoralized nations that yield to the first attack of the invader."      ^ Madame D'Okenheime, now, could she have suddenly seen him, would probably have discovered much greater changes. She would have had the advantage of comparing him with himself-then and now, untrammelled by the sha- ding and confusing influence of daily observation, and would not only have been struck by the physical marks of advan- cing age, but would, also, have been able to detect many slight and undefined changes of expression that just as clearly indicate the wear and tear of time upon the soul. And this observation brings us naturally and directly to the subject of the pleasant thoughts that, to judge from the half-formed smile on his lips, were floating through his mind. He was thinking of that sunny time at Baden ; of those de- lightful walks by the banks of the Oose; of his fair compan- ion in those walks, who had so suddenly disappeared from his passionate gaze, and to whose place of retreat, or possible fate, his most diligent researches had been able to discover no clue. Pleasant, memories no doubt, but very wrong in a married man, a father of a family, and a member of the    104       NEVER AGAIN.  church. He felt that they were very wrong, and a hundred times he had resolved to banish them entirely. He perhaps would have succeeded in doing so had not his curiosity been continually piqued by a mystery that he could not solve. What had become of her? Why did she leave Baden so sud- denly, for Basle, without bidding him good-bye? Why, at Basle, could he find no trace of her? Had the aroused jealousy of her husband anything to do with her disappear- ance? If so, what 'had been her fate, and why, had he never been able to find any German who knew anything of the family' or name? He could not answer these questions, and so, despite a sense of propriety, and marital duty, and the prickings of a conscience, stirred up to a weekly qui vive by the exhortations of the pious and fashionable rector of St. Cyprians, and not- withstanding a tolerably clear conviction that the secret pride many excellent men take in certain kinds of by-gone and re- pented-of sin, adds no great unction to the "Good Lord de- liver us " of the penitent, he could not help chewing/ the cud of i recollection, and occasionally rolling the sweet morsel under his tongue. He arose, and taking a bunch of keys from his pocket, selected one that opened an inner drawer of his Writing-table. From this drawer he took out an old and well-worn pocket- book, and from the pocket-book a tress of fine silky light- brown hair. He held it up between his eye and the window, through which streamed the reddish light of the setting sun. He watched, lost in thought, the gleams of the secret, hardly suspected ruby-shades that, secure in their auburn cover from the attacks of reflected light, were compelled to come out from their hiding-places by the more powerful and penetra- ting transmitted rays. While engaged in this interesting oc- cupation, the door was suddenly opened, and the Editor of the New York Universe was ushered into the room. Mr. Ledgeral started. His first impulse was to conceal the tress of hair, but seeing'who his visitor was, he changed his mind, and, while returning Mr. Whoppers' salutation,   NE VER AGAIN.:         I05 deliberately proceeded to fold up the ringlet in its paper en- velope, and return it to the re'cesses of the old pocket-book. "You are late," exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral ;"I have finished dinner, and have been expecting you this half hour." "Couldn't help it," replied Mr. Whoppers, in a familiar, free-and-easy tone. "Couldn't find an uncrowded omnibus, and had to knock my feet against the curb-stone of Fulton Street for twenty minutes. But I see you had something to amuse you; sorry to disturb your after-dinner musings ; study- ing Locke, eh? Mrs. Ledgeral has brown hair, I believe. But, my dear sir, light tress or dark tress, don't let what I say or saw distress you." Mr. Ledgeral colored up a little, and looked for an in- stant somewhat confused. "Oh, pshaw, it was nothing but an old lock of hair that I was looking at. Twenty years ago, and more, it came of a little affaire de coeur I had when quite a youngster, in Europe." "Affair de cur! Ah, yes, I see-a dog-fight," said Mr. Whoppers. "A dog-fight!" exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral, in a slightly in- dignant tone, which, however, was wholly unobserved by his visitor. "What else should it be? An affair de cur, and in your days of puppyhood, too. I suppose thereby hangs a tale?" "No, sir," said Mr. Ledgeral, still more stiffly; "there is, and was, no tale." "No tale! Why, sir, you are as bad off as the old knife- grinder, or a Scotch terrier. But, perhaps, the tale was cut short in your days of puppyhood, or may be bit off in the affair de cur-ha! ha! ha! Good idea, that. I'll put it in the next Universe." Could the stately, elegant, fastidious, and somewhat re- served Mr. Ledgeral have had his own way, he would have rung for a servant, and diretted that Mr. Whoppers should be shown to the street door. But there was an ambitious Mr. Ledgeral that counselled differently, and there was an excess- ively vain Mr. Ledgeral that couldn't bear the idea of quar   x o6        NE VER AGAIN. relling with so useful a person as the,editor of the New York Universe, and one who had it in his power to take such prompt revenge, not only in the pages of the Universe, but in the columns of the daily press, with which he still sus- tained intimate relations. It was not, however, the mere fact that Mr. Whoppers owned and edited a journal that gave him his influence with Mr. Ledgeral. True, it was pleasant for a vain man to see his name in print, even in a weekly journal, and that not, perhaps, of the greatest circulation, in connection with some laudatory notice of a report or set of resolutions, or speech; or with some allusion to mer- chant princes and citizens of the highest respectability; or with some editorial suggestion of the right kind of a candi- date upon whom all parties could unite their suffrages, for Mayor, or Member of Congress, or State Senator. All this is very pleasant and agreeable; somewhat expensive, it is true, but, if a gentleman will beg or buy his newspaper-fame he must expect to pay for it in some form. There were, however, other services much more important than the editor of the Universe had it in his power to render. Mr. Ledgeral had a great flow of ideas. He had ideas of the highest importance upon all subjects, political, social, literary, and artistic. His intellect rambled over every field of human thought, except the purely scientific. In that, he found the' fences too high and straight, the hedges too stiff, and the ditches too wide, and the troublesome stumps of naked facts not unfrequently sticking themselves right up in the path. He had also a great flow of words. He could talk by the hour on his favorite topics ; but, somehow, when he came to writing, his flow of ideas and his flow of words did not combine happily. Like the currents of the Arve and Rhone, the confluence was imperfect, or established with difficulty. He could not write elegantly or clearly. Why it should be so, he was puzzled to understand. He was desirous of writing well. He had labored and studied to acquire the art of writ- ing well. It was important to the world and society that he should write well, inasmuch as he had so many valuable      NEVER AGA IN.         x07 thoughts and suggestions to publish, and, so many reports to present of nominating, and building, and fund-raising com- mittees of the Historical, Geographical, and Ethnological As- sociations; and many resolutions to draw, and speeches to make for the societies of St. Nicholas, St. George, and St. David, to say nothing of the Chamber of Commerce, and Tammany Hall. Why couldn't he write well, and ,brilliantly,- and clearly? "I'll tell you," said Mr. Whoppers, bluntly, "to write clearly and brilliantly, a man must think clearly and bril- liantly." "And do you mean to say that I don't think clearly? I say nothing of brilliantly, but I will say, sir, clearly and cor- rectly," demanded Mr. Ledgeral, justly indignant that a man whom he was treating to a lunch of Spanish mackerel and 'Rudesheimer at Delmonico's should venture such a thrust at his Amphitryon's vanity. Are not the ideas I give you to work over perfectly clear?" Mr. Whoppers shut one eye, and rolled the other with a cool, quizzical leer, from'his glass of Rudesheimer to the face of his entertainer. There was nothing of the parasite about the editor of the Universe. 'He was always ready to eat his dinner, provided it was a good one, with any one who would pay for it; or he was ever ready to pocket his pay for a puff or first-rate notice; but he was no sycophant. He had too high a sense of his position for that. He felt that only a state of habitual beneficent condescension enabled him to associate on equal terms with fellows who couldn't write leading articles, or dress up a sensational " to-be-continued," or make decent puns. "Ideas!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, one day, in a tone of careless effrontery, characteristic of the literary Bohemian. "Ideas! I never knew you to have any ideas at all-few people have ideas. Ghosts of ideas, sir, such as always stalk round at dinner-tables, and haunt conversaziones and tea- fights,-people very generally mistake them for ideas; but they are nothing but ghosts of ideas, or at best, nothing but   z o0        -fAE VER AGAIN.           skeletons-mere skeletons, nothing but bones, sir, and often with the maOiies ossizm at that. It requires sharp thinking to fill 'em, up with fat and flesh. Mere expression afterwards is nothing. They hop into a coat of words and sentences as naturally and as readily as if a dozen literary tailors had been cutting up dictionaries on purpose." Mr. Ledgeral would not, and could not, admit the truth of this; but he found it useless to dlscussthe question with such a dogmatic opponent.  He continued to find ideas for numerous reports and speeches, while Mr. Whoppers cut and trimmed, and patched the brilliant rhetorical dresses in which they figured before the world.  It would not do for the two to quarrel, and least of either would it do for, Mr. Ledgeral; so, instead of ringing the bell for a-servant to show his visitor the door, he forced himself to smile a little, in a mild way, at the terribly witty version of an affaire de etur, and at once reverted to the business which was the object of Mr. Whoppers' visit. "You have finished the report?" he demanded. Mr Whoppers nodded, and produced from  his pocket a roll of manuscript, and the two were soon engrossed in the reading and revision of a report upon the statistics of juvenile mud- larks and dock-wollopers; with an inquiry into te relation between exposed molasses-casks and sugar-hogsheads, and the numbers, condition, and final fate of these youthful spec- imens of total depravity. "And your committee would re- spectfully suggest," read Mr. Whoppers, with increased unc- tion, as he came  to the conclusion, "that the most active measures be immediately taken to remove this great and growing evil; and they would recommend as a  practical measure of the highest importance, that the rising generation of our ppuper population should be at once taught the neces- sity and utility of settled habits of honest industry; that they should be made to see the disgusting deformity of idleness and vice, and the beauties of virtue and holiness; and that they should be imbued, as rapidly as possible, with a taste for the purer enjoyments and more refined pleasures of life."   VE VER A GA IN.     .   og9 "That sounds well," exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral, as the reader concluded. "You flatter me," said Mr. Whoppers; "the sound is mine, but the sense is yours. I claim nothing but the sound, vox et prelerea nih'il. The conversation was interrupted. The door was sud- denly flung open, when Miss Heien Ledgeral, with a gliding, but impetuous step; came into the room. We will not stop to describe her here, inasmuch as it will be necessary to do so more fully further on, when, by some three years of efflorescent force, the budding beauties of sixteen shall have been ripened' into all the luxuriant glories of confirmed womanhood. Helen drew back for an instant, but seeing that the visitor Was only Mr. Whoppers, she simply subdued somewhat of her Excited manner, and advanced a little more quietly, but still with rapid energy, towards her father. "Oh! father! father!" she exclaimed; "you recollect the young man whom we picked up out of the river that night when the sloop was run down. Well, he's here, or rather, he was here; but he's gone now, and he fainted almost dead ,away in the hall, and Joseph thought at first that he was drunk; but I knew that he wasn't drunk, and I ran and got some water, and was going to throw it in his face; but he came to, and I made him drink the water, and then he thanked me. Oh, you should see him; such a gentlemanly way, and well dressed, too! He doesn't look at all as he did that night on the steamboat. He's grown so thin and pale, and Joseph says that he wishes now he'd got him a glass of wine, for he thinks that perhaps he was faint for want of something to eat; and I wish so, too, only I know he wouldn't have taken it; but I do wish Joseph had got it for him, and if I had only thought of it, he might have got him some of the meringues and some charlotte-russe. The dinner-things have not all been cleared away, and there is a whole form that we didn't touch." "Well, well, tell us what this young gentleman came for- not merely to renew his acquaintance with you, I hope," said Mr. Ledgeral.     IIO        NEVER AGAIN. "That is just what I was going to tell you. He came here to leave this letter, and he did not intend to come in, but he thought that Joseph said I was not in town, and while talking about it he grew faint. Oh, father, you must do some- thing for him! Read the letter, and promise me, promise me that you will find a situation for him. I don't care what, if it's nice. He wants to make a large fortune as soon as possible, and I want that he should." "Fortunate youth to have such an advocate," said Mr. Whoppers. "What had he to offer as a retainer-good looks, eh? Ah! Miss Helen, look out, or rather, look in; take care and read your Wordsworth- ' "'He was a lovely youth, I guess, The panther in the wilderness ' Was not so fair as he. And when he chose to sport and play, No dolphin ever was so gay Upon the tropic sea.' " "Oh, you are laughing at me, Mr. Whoppers, but you are right, too. I am a good advocate, for I'll tell you what I'll do if papa don't promise--I'll put on my hat and run right around to Uncle Shippen. I can do anything with Uncle Shippen. You may laugh, but I can make him do anything I please." "I don't doubt it, Miss Helen ; I've no doubt that beneath your smile his very purse-strings would relax, to say nothing of his heart-strings. He'd be a harder old codger than I think he is, if he did not yield to such influences." "You mean a compliment to rAe, I suppose, Mr. Whop- pers, but I won't thank you for it, if you call Uncle Shippen an old codger," exclaimed Helen. Mr. Whoppers was beginning to apologize in a mocking tone, when he was cut short by Mr. Ledgeral. "What do you think of that?" said he, tossing Luther's letter across the table; "it seems to me uncommonly well expressed." Mr. Whoppers took the letter, and ran his eye over it.

"You'll take tea, Mr. Whoppers?" asked Mr. Ledgeral, as Joseph entered the library. "You won't! Why, what is your hurry? Stop and take a cup. -You decline?'" "Teatotally!" ejaculated Mr. Whoppers. "Well, -then, find that young man, and I'll see you about him to-morrow." "He has given his address, I see, in this letter. I'll find him, and I'll tell him that he has made a first-rate shot: he aimed at the little chicken, and hit the old cock, too. If he is as clever at the pistol as he is at the epistle, eh? Mr. Ledgeral was left alone in his study, musing over Luther's letter. "Very well expressed, indeed," he muttered, half aloud; "just enough to the point, and nothing super- fluous. Confound that Whoppers, with his insolenc and his disgusting puns; I have half a mind to get rid of hi I be- lieve I will do so. However, I cannot part with him just yet ;"' and Mr. Ledgeral mused for some time in silence. The fact was he rather  liked the editor of the Universe, after all; if he hadn't such a free-and-easy way with him, he would have quite liked him. He was certainly not decidedly vulgar, and inso- lence was, maybe, a hard word to apply to what was, perhaps,   iV'IER AGAINV.         II3   nothing but good-natured independence. "I shall want a ... good deal of wire-pulling, by and by, and Whoppers is a use- ful fellow. No, I can't part with him yet; but this letter is certainly very well written for a raw country youth. How cu- rious it is that some fellows have a knack of writing-some- thing that is born with them. Now a common business letter I can write as well as any man, but when it comes to fine wri- ting, such as is expected in a report or a speech-  Confound. that punning devil! I wonder if Dr. Johnson ever did say that 'a man who would make a pun would pick a pocket.' I must look in Boswell's Life, some day, and if I can find it I'll show it to Whoppers. But this letter certainly reads very well. I must keep an eye upon that youngster, he may be useful. Yes, decidedly; I'll tell Gainsby to make room for him, and set him at something." Luther returned to his lodgings with a lighter step and a lighter heart. His grand act of humiliation had been accom- plished, and he felt better for it. He had shown himself to her, not as a conquering hero, but as a broken-down suppliant-broken down not only in spirit, but in body and in purse. "He that humbleth himself shall be exalted," and as Luther had no one to exalt him, he exalted himself. He felt proud of the thoroughness And completeness of his break- down. The heroics -are often clever mental gymnasts, and can " turn abou t, and wheel about, and jump Jim Crow," to the utter amazement of all sober feeling and sentiment. He felt better, too, from the natural influence of her unhes- itating sympathy, and the consequent revivification of his deadened hopes. And still better he felt, when, on the strength of his brightened prospects, he accepted the invita- tion of his landlord, aild a plate of clam chowder renewed the vigor of the fainting flesh. Luther slept sounder that night than he had done for a month-slept so well that it was quite late in the morning -when he was awakened by a knock at his door, and the an-     "       . N VER AGAIN. nouncement that a gentleman wanted to see him. He hurried on his clothes, and descended to the dingy bar-room, where he found the editor of the Universe talking with Mr. Bungay, the landlord, in whom he had found an old acquaintance; and standing treat to a party of tars, whom he was pumping with all manner of questions, in the hope of picking up some items of news, or some hints for a tale. "And so you left the Juliana, because of a few cock. roaches?" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "A few cockroaches!" indignantly replied the spokesman of the group. "Lord bless you, what do you call a few?-a thousand now, or five hundred thousand?-or five hundred thousand million billion? Why the roaches were so thick that every step you took up and down the deck you'd kill a dozen of 'em. The captain and mates always had to fight their way forward with trumpet, spy-glass, or marling-spikes, and when we relieved the wheel, a man had to get in the fore- top, work his way aft, and come down by the mizzen back-stay. Not a soul had been below for three months, except one poor fellow who tumbled down the forecastle hatch, head foremost, into the cockroaches. Whe cockroaches closed over him. He  struggled for a moment, but 'twant no use-in five minutes his bones were picked   as clean as my knife blade.  We   worked round into Santa Cruz, but the roaches on our yard-arms began to fly off in clouds to the other vessels in the roadstead, and the governor pointed the guns of the fort at us, and ordered us to clear out, which we did, but when out we couldn't set a rag of sail, or haul our yards round, for the roaches were so thick' they choked the blocks, and devil a brace or halyard could. be made to run. We floated round for a long time, all hands sleeping in the boats that we kept towing astern, until I got tired, and says I, Boys, let's cut and run for the Grand Canary,' which we did one night. We   reached Grand Canary in -safety got across to Orratavo, in Teneriffe, and took ship for Cadiz." "Cadiz! my dear fellow," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, "you did wrong-you ought to have sailed for Roachelle, or shipped,   at least, on a whaler. I don't know anybody better than you who could have taken a roach-back. But I am much obliged to you for your yarn. It's short, and it encroaches a little on the fabulous, butNt's tough, and will- do to string two or three 'to-be-continueds' on. Ah, here comes my man," and Mr. Whoppers turned to Luther, and cordially shook his hand. "You look surprised at seeing me. Come with me, and I'll tell you all about it. I haven't had my breakfast yet, nor you either. Well, we'll go up to the corner of Chambers Street and Broadway.  I guess Delmonico can manage to assuage any regrets at missing our friend Miss Jones pan- cakes and 'sassages' this morning. Is your kit all packed? I will just ask Mr. Bungay, here, to send it up to Bleecker Street?" "No!no!" exclaimed Luther. "I can't go back there. I already owe Miss Jones'for two weeks board, and "- "Pshaw!" interposed Mr. Whoppers. "I've settled all that. Miss Jones is dying to have you back. She thinks you are such a nice young man. Do you know how I managed her? You left some scraps of writing in your room when you left. She found them." "Found them!" exclaimed Luther, coloring up to the roots of his hair. "Yes, found them. Confound her, I suppose you think; but there is no harm done, the verses had no name to them. Here they are. Bungay, are you a judge of poetry?" de- manded Mr. Whoppers, turning to the landlord, as he pulled Luther's scribblings fro'n his pocket. "I consate I am," returned Mr. Bungay. "I boarded a crazy poet once, for six months-Bill Jennings, the bully poet of Jarsey; found him in beer and tobacco, and took it all out in rhymed.  "Well, listen to this, then; it isn't bad for an early speci- men  "' The poet's privilege, jfair maid, is mine To make all beauty subject of my verse, To boldly sing thy loveliness divine, And all thy charms of mind and heart rehearse.   II6     -NEVEER A GAIN. ' But I forbear to trust my feeble hand With theme so lovely, and to me so new; Not even Moses could have mapped the Holy Land From Pisgah's glorious, but far-distant, view. 'Defaulting thus in laudatory lays, These flowers I send thee, brimmed with incense sweet, To bear 'mid odorous strains of fitting praise, My humble service to thy gentle feet. ' Refuse them not, because the poor, dumb creatures Cannot to thee my name and state reveal, Take them, as kin to thee in all their features, And let my name a friendly blank conceal.'  Utterly dumbfounded,- Luther listened to this public ax. posure of his poetical sins, this profanation of his most tender and delicate sentiments, this proclamation, in the reeking bar. room of a sailor's boarding-house, of a secret he had hardly dared to confess to himself.  And what made it more ridic- ulous was that the flowers existed- only in his imagination. A fellow who could not pay his board bill, buying and sending flowers! 'Twas absurd, and Luther had a keen appreciation of the absurd.   He grasped the back of a chair to steady him- self, and fairly gasped for breath, as he felt the surge of hbor ror, and shame, and indignation, rolling over him. "Now, that I call pretty fair. Don't you, Bungay?  The peak of Pisgah is a little steep, eh? and that back stretch .to Moses a little longish for anything under a two-forty fancy; but I like it-it shows bottom   as well as speed. Training will tell on that colt, eh-old hoss?" Mr. Whoppers prided himself upon his ability to adapt himself in manners or conversation to all sorts of men. Turn- ing to Luther, he continued: "Now, I told Miss Jones that the  'fair maid' meant her.  'Dear me,' said she. 'Just so,' said I;' it's dear you.' 'Dear me,' said she, 'I'm old enough to be his mother.' 'But you are not his mother; and  what is more, you are not old enough  to be his mother. You might be' his mother's youngest sister, or something of that kind,' said I; 'but all that has nothing to do with it. I don't pre.

He has just made a rest of you, and you ought to rest satisfied, for it's a very pretty compliment.' 'Well,' said Miss Jones-,' he's a very nice young man, and I wish he was back again.' So, back you go, Mr. Luther. Bun- gay, you'll send his kit up to Bleecker Street?" "But," objected Luther, as he and Mr. Whoppers directed their steps towards Broadway, "I have'no means of paying her, and I cannot, I will not, get any deeper in her debt. Then, perhaps, I shall never have the means of paying her; now I may hope to be able -to settle so small a debt. My friend, Captain Combings, made me promise him  on this point; the last words he said to me, were-6 Luther, remember, debt'is the devil, and, as an old writer says, next to the grace of God, a receipt in full is the'best instrument for baffling the old boy. It is not what you owe other people, but it's also what you owe yourself. Pay as you go, and you will be de- livered from a thousand temptations to vanity and sin."' Mr. Whoppers stroked his long, yellow beard, and looked askance at the honest and open countenance of the young moralist. He saw nothing to throw a doubt upon Luther's earnestness and sincerity. "Your friend, the Captain, is quite right," said Mr. Whop- pers; "I can speak from experience. I wish I had had such a capital Captain at my elbow, a few years ago. Debt is a ter- rible thing, but then, like other terrible things in this world of profit and loss, it can't always be avoided. Best' to take it, when it comes, in a cheerful spirit: It's a misfortune, it is true, but we must bear up under it. There is one considera- tion," continued Mr. Whoppers, with a comical-twinkle in his little ferret eyes, "that ought to make it more easy to bear, and that is, the evil is shared with one's creditors. Now, in that matter of your fortnight's board, there's two of you concerned; you and Miss Jones-that is only one wxeek apiece."   NE VER AGA IN. Luther hardly knew what to make of his companion' serious tone, and, for a moment, was somewhat confused by this novel view of his outstanding liabilities. "And debt, after all, is such a curious thing, such a singu. lar thing-I may say, such a funny thing: in fact, a singularly funny thing!  Do you take? No! Well, it's a singularly funlny, thing, in this: that it is the only thing in the world that, the nore you contract it the bigger it grows." Mr. Whoppers stopped short in his walk, stroked his straggling whiskers vigorously, and burst into a hearty laugh: Not bad, that, eh?-pretty fair, don't you think?" "Very good," replied Luther, laughing; "I only hope you, have not run into debt for it." "Now, Luther, that is very ungenerous. You ought to be more willing to give trust. Never refuse tick to a joke. Why, if a man isn't to say a smart thing, or a wise thing, or a funny thing, because of the possibility that some clever forestalling rascal has been and said it before him, we mirit as well knock under to commonplace at once, and getting down on our knees, exclaim: 'Hail, boredom! we are thy slaves; thy captains and thy strong men are too much for us. Who may withstand the might of thy Dr. Droneys? We lick the dust at their feet, and gratefully fill our mental bellies with theemp- tiness of their utterances!' Of course, a fellow would like to be always original, but he can't, you know, in these latter days. Why, the forestallers have been at it for two thousand years and more! Those old Greeks and Romans were perfectly outrageous. Thank God, they have not all survived. The burning of that Alexandrian library was a blessed thing, and the dark ages did their duty pretty well; but there is one fel- low I wish they had used up, and that's Horace. Have you ever read Horace? A few odes, eh? Well, don't you read any more of him. He'll fill your head with such a lot of ideas and so many nice turns of expression, that when you come to be one of us-as I am afraid you will some day-and want to put your pen to paper upon social subjects, you won't be able to tell for the life of you whether to steal or quote   NE VER AGAIN.          J9 But we were talking about emptiness, just now. That reminds me that we haven't had breakfast, and here we are at Delmon- ico's; let us hurry in, and I will tell you how it has been ar- ranged for you to pay your debts to Miss Jones, after we have ordered our bzf-teke au cresson and our pomme de terre a la, maitre d'hotel."     .  Having given the waiter -his orders, Mr. Whoppers re. sumed the conversation,, ahd, very much to the young man's astonishment, broached the subject of Luther's letter to Miss Helen Ledgeral. He told Luther of Helen's appli- cation to 'her father; detailed the conversation that en- sued; and informed him, that he, Mr. Whoppers, had been commissioned to hunt Luther up, and inform him that some kind of a situation would be given himn, by which he might, at least, earn enough to pay his board. "Mr. Ledgeral wants to see you, himself," said Mr, Whoppers; "you will go up-to his house, and he will give you a note to Gainsby, his junior, which you will deliver in Burling Slip. Now, don't let your imagination run away with you-there is no great for- tune in prospect. It will be small pay, and hard work, for years; I know what a clerk's life is; I've led it myself. If you have industry, and great tenacity of purpose, and good luck, you may stand about one chance in five thousand of being taken into partnership by some firm, and after that, about one chance in five hundred of coming out a rich man. There is one other point that I have half a mind to give you a little bit of caution on. I know you'll resent it, although I give it in good part; I know I should at your age." Luther protested that he could not feel otherwise than under an obligation for any advice. \"I don't know about that; however, I'll tell you that it's possible that you may, once in a while, see Miss Helen Ledg- eral. Mind you, I say, once in a while only; for as to ayoung clerk in the counting-room down town ever getting the run of the up-town parlors, that is quite out of the possibilities. Now, don't you go and get love-sick, and make a scribbling spoony of yourself."   T20         NEVE R AGAZ INT. The blood rushed to Luther's face. "There, you need not say a word, I see you would deny it; but don't I know who the ' fair maid' stands for in your verses?  --' It were all one, That you should love a bright, particular star And think to wed it.' -I won't go on and say what Shakespeare says, 'she is so far above you,' for I don't believe it; but she is far removed front you; there is a golden gulf between you. You'd have to wade through a sea of silver to reach her, and your legs are not full grown yet. No, my dear boy, she'll marry some fel. low with a settled business, a good income, certain social pre. tensions, and that, too, before your first salary as junior clerk is doubled. But," continued Mr. Whoppers, looking at his watch, "it is ten o'clock; just the time to call on your new master. You'll catch him before he leaves for down town. Go in boldly, give him your name, and tell him you come by my directions. He'll receive you kindly enough. He isn't a bad fellow-if he can't write a smart squib or a leading article, and don't appreciate a pun. Try him for awhile, at any rate, and if he don't suit, why, I'll see if I can't do something for you in our line. You are cut out for one of us-only I don't want to take the risk of inoculating you for the disease. I had rather you should take it in the natural way. A fellow that can scribble both in verse and prose, at your age, ought to be able, after a little training, to get at least his living in almost any newspaper office.  I'll see you at dinner in Bleecker Street. And, hark ye, the maternal instinct is strong in Miss Jones, and if you can contrive to come the filial affec- tion dodge, I have no doubt she will adopt you." Luther parted from his new friend with an expression of thankfulness for the interest he had evinced in his fortunes, and turned up Broadway on his way to Washington Square. It was with a rapid step, but with a good deal of mental hes- itation, that he gained Waverly Place, and turned down towards   /NE VE R B-A GA IN.      121 the Square. His active imagination was at work, dressing up the repelling qualities of the great merchant in the most formid- able proportions. He had a lurking suspicion that such a jaunty, free-and-easy, devil-me-care kind of a fellow as Mr. Whoppers, was not altogether to be trusted; and that, per- haps, Mr. Whoppers had overvalued his influence with Mr. Ledgeral, and had misconceived his intentions. A sense of the vast social distance between a wealthy New York mer- chant, and an unknown, penniless, country youth, suggested by Mr. W oppers' double metaphor of a golden gulf and a silver sea, inesed withl every step. And what was he going to call upon this great man for? 5 Why, to seek an employment, by which, as his friend Mr. : Whoppers had coolly phrased it, he could earn enough to pay l for his board. Yesterday, the prospect would have been of' the brightest; to-day, it did not seem quite so brilliant. True, it was the first step in the ladder of Fortune--it lifted him out of the mud and dust of absolute destitution; but the lad- der seemed longer than ever, and the rounds more numer- ous. Could he ever climb it?-he must climb it. Gaunt hunger impelled the first step, but a still sterner necessity urged the effort and encouraged the desire to mount to the topmost round. He felt this necessity in the very air he breathed. He felt it in the universal social tone; it came to him in the newspapers, in books, in lectures, and even in sermons. The united voicings of his age and his country dinned in his ears the necessity of wealth--enormous wealth; not a moderate modicum of golden dross, not a mean, sordid, self-sufficiency of fortune, to be hoarded, and gloated over, and worshipped with that vulgar reverence which is to be sought for in its highest instances, not in this country, biit among our kind cousins of England, or our spirituael fiend/ of France. Talk of the almighty dollar! Better talk of the almighty tuppence-ha'penny, or the almighty wuvs. Vanity, pride, ambition, love, taste, charity, philanthropy-all coun- selled the necessity of wealth, aId Ltfther thought of Young's line                  . -"The wretched impotence of gold."   122         E NVE R A GA IN. Wretched impotence, indeed! -"Why, 'tis gold Which buys admittance; oft it doth, yea and makes Diana's rangers, false themselves, yield up Their deer to the stand of the stealer; and 'tis gold Which makes the true man killed, and saves the thief; Nay, sometimes hIangs both thief and true man: what Can it not do and undo?" Luther longed for fortune-not with an envious jmean-spirited longing-not with an idle longing for some rich man's money, but a generous longing, a hopeful longing, such as only an American boy can -feel, because only he can indulge the de. sire amid the glorious possibilities, nay, the probabilities, of early fruition. "But what if I am doomed to fail!" ex- claimed Luther; " thousands, even in this country, fail to command fortune," and he went off into a train of thought which culminated in a loud utterance just as he reached the door of Mr. Ledgeral's house. "No, no," he energetically exclaimed, with a flourish of his- hand, " ' a man's a man for a' that.'" 4 Startled at the sound of his own voice, he looked up, caught the wondering eye of a gentleman passing, and, to hide his confusion, sprang briskly up the-steps, and rang the bell. Joseph quickly answered *te summons, and, opening the door, received Luther with a dignified nod of recognition. "Glad to see you, sah; hope your health am better, sah, den 'twas las' ebening." "Thank you," replied Luther. "I am quite recovered, and I also thank you for your attention, last evening. Can I see Mr. Ledgeral?" "Mr. Ledgeral, sah; de fader, sah?" inquired Joseph, with a gracious grin; "ah, yes; well, he's in de library. Walk dis way, sah."     n At the door, Luther hesitated. "I should like to' ask," he said, in a lower tone, "if Miss Ledgeral is well, this morn- ing?"   NE VER A GAIN.         123 "Miss Helen, sah? well she am, I tink. She eat one egg and two slices ob toast dis morning. Dat's purty well. She'd be weller if she eat de regular rule ob two eggs. I tell her so ; but she tink one egg purty well." "Her mother and sister, you told me last evening, are not in town." "No, sah, dey is trabbling for de benefit ob de health of Miss Ledgeral. Her health am below de eggs altogedder. She hab a touch ob de dispipsha." "Has Miss Helen Ledgeral any other sisters or brothers?" demanded Luther. "No, sah, no odder ones." . Joseph was evidently disposed -to be communicative, but Luther refrained from asking any more questions, and' the old man, pushing open the library door, ushered Luther into the presence of Mr. Ledgeral. Joseph closed the door. "I like dat young man,", he muttered, as he shuffled across the hall to the back parlor, from whence issued sounds evoked from a piano-forte by rapid fingers in industrious practice. "I like him. He's young, and he's green ; but he don't look as do he ebber would hab dat imlperient look like Mister Billy Dugan, or dat sassy clerk dat comes up here sometimes from de store. Cal- me ' old woolly-head,' ha! well, I nebber; but this one look'- good, he hab agreeable eyes, he hab an agreeable mouf, and he hab an agreeable nose. And if he only had an agreeable fortun'- he might hab my permishun to snoop round dar and see what he could do," and the speaker jerked his thumb over his shoulder in the 'direction of the parlor door. "I don't like dese 'scity men. Dey ain't worth shucks.

But ye can't come it Billy; yer a lunk head wid all yer money, yer a regular sappy, ye are; call me old woolly-head, eh! Well I guess de old woolly-head can unscrew your buggy-springs for ye-ye've got a long road to ride-two or three years yet-and I'm afraid ye'll get jolted." Joseph put his head into the parlor. "What you tink, Miss Helen?" he exclaimed, addressing the young girl, who suspended the fingering of a difficult passage to listen to him. "What do you tink, eh? dat young chap ob de steamboat hab come agin." "To see me, Joseph?" "Wal, I shouldn't wonder if dat was de real objic', but de 'stensible objic' was to see your farder. I show'd him into de liberary." "Why, of course, he did not come to see me. How can you be so stupid as to think so, Joseph? My father is going to give him a situation in the counting-room, and father told Mr. Whoppers to send him up here this morning." -"Ob course I'se stupid-I'se drefful stupid," replied Joseph, with a sly twinkle of intelligence in his eye that com- pletely belied the humiliating admission, "Ob course I is, but I tought dat you was so much flustrated las' ebening 'cause he fainted awah, dat mabbe you would like to see how well he got dis morning, and I tought dat he would like to tell you about de conserquence ob your interseshshion wid yer farder, and I tought dat he'd like to tank you for de glass ob water. He tank me berry purlitely; but I'se drefful stupid. If he axes about you I'll tell him you is engaged, and can't see nobody." "No, no, Joseph, you need not do that. You can leave the parlor door wide open, and perhaps I will speak a word with him in the hall, that is if I happen to see him come out Df the library. You understand, Joseph?" "I tink I do, Miss Helen, but Ise drefful stupid," replied Joseph, as, muttering, chuckling, Pre shuffled himself off to his work in the butler's pantry. *     *     *     * '   NEVER AGAIN.         125 The interview with Mr. Ledgeral was a far less for- midable affair than Luther had anticipated. He was re- ceived-with a stiff, but not wholly ungracious nod, and an invitation to take a seat, while Mr. Ledgeral finished writing a letter at which he was engaged. This seat was luckily near a book-case, and he amused himself with poring over the titles of the books within the compass of his eye. He won- dered whether it would be too much of a liberty if he lifted one of them from its place and opened it. Had it not been for the gorgeously gilt bindings the temptation to such an im- pertinent freedom would perhaps have been irresistible. Mr. Ledgeral finished his note, and took a deliberate sur- vey of his visitor. What he saw evidently did not displease him. How should it? He saw a tall, trim, graceful figure; he saw a fine large head, thick waving locks of brown hair, large, deep, almost bottomless brown eyes, a well-formed dominating nose, splendid teeth, and a sjkin to which the amber and crimson tints, mingling in lustrous harmony, were rapidly returning under the influence of a good full meal. Decidedly Luther was good-looking-handsome in fact, if we compare him with the multitudes of lanky, cadaverous, lantern- jawed, old-looking, nicotinized young men whom we meet on every side; but he had none of that conscious and obtrusive beauty, tltt impertinent prettiness, that insulting youthfulness which is so often an offence to middle-aged gentlemen who with cunning tricks of fence are desperately warding off the blows of that furious old fellow of the scythe. "Are you fond of books?" abruptly demanded Mr. Ledg- eral. "Well, I :suppose so," he continued, seeing Luther hesitate. "But it don't much matter; you write a good hand, I see by this letter, and the composition is very good, the con- struction and grammar quite correct; where have you been educated?" Thus questioned and encouraged, Luther went into the details of his school-life and his studies. "Do you know anything of accounts?" "No, sir, I can't say I do. I was going to study book-   1z2o        iEV ER AGA IN. keeping, but our- Latin master said I was doing so weJ1 in l Latin that I had better wait until I had got a little further on before I took up any new study." "So you have studied Latin--pray how far have you got in your Latin?" "Well, sir, I have read Sallust and Caesar's commentaries, and the six first books of the AEneid, and Cicero de Senectute, and had just begun on a few odes of Horace." Mr. Ledgeral mused in silence for a few moments. His thoughts went back to-his youthful days, when he, too, having mastered the rudimentary difficulties of the Latin grammar, and dawdled away a couple of years of preparatory study, might have gone on to the heights or depths of an ordinary Columbia College classical education. Alas! for neglected opportunities. Could it be that his inability to write clearly and strongly was due to his ignorance of Latin and Greek. Could it be that Longinus and Quintilian would have made him independent of that Whoppers?  No! he knew clever writers who had never been to college, and who knew nothing of Latin and Greek, and he knew clever writers who, having been to college, nevertheless knew nothing of Latin and Greek. In fact, he knew that of nine-tenths, yes, ninety-nine hundredths, of our college graduates not one, in five vears after taking his degree, can read a page of any strange classic. "You will have but little opportunity, and no disposition, to pursue your classical studies any further, I presume?" said Mr. Ledgeral, in an inquiring tone. "I shall have no opportunity, I suppose," answered Luther, despondingly; "but I have the disposition." "In that case, I am not so sure," replied Mr. Ledgeral, "about your not having the opportunity; a strong disposition always makes opportunity. You will have some hours of the day, and all your evenings to yourself. I would advise you to pursue your classical studies, seeing you have got such a good start. There is the famous Dr. Brown, now-the great tHomceopathist and Spiritualist,-he is one of the most enthu-   A EV Va AGAIN.        I27- Asiatic Latin scholars that I know. He reads himself to sleep, every night with Seneca or Cicero, he refreshes himself in his carriage, between-his visits, with a page of Pliny, and the other day, calling upon him, I found him poring over the Somnium Scipionis, in which he had discovered, as he said, upon the indubitable testimony of the great Roman orator and philoso- pher, an authentic and reliable account of one of the earliest manifestations of the spirit world. He acquired his education under many difficulties and disadvantages, and owes nothing -to any college for a knowledge of the classics. Don't, how- ever, neglect your other, studies, or your general reading, and don't neglect the duties of the place to which my partner, 'Mr. Gainsby, upon the presentation of this note, will assign you." "I will do the best I can, sir," said Luther, taking the note and bowing himself out of the room-the consciousness of not having made a bad impression giving him an easy but unpresuming grace of manner in doing so, that was quite in contrast with his embarrassed, awkward entrance. By a fortunate and rather singular coincidence, Helen Ledgeral was at the same moment coming out of the back parlor with a roll of music in her hand. Luther bowed in a shy way, but resolutely crossed the hall, determined to make his acknowledgments to the young girl for her sympathy and assistance. "You have had an interview with father; I hope that it has been a satisfactory one ?" she demanded. "Yes, thanks to your kindness," replied Luther. " Miss Ledgeral, I don't know that I shall ever have an opportunity again of saying how much I feel indebted to you, and there- fore you must permit me to make my acknowledgments now. I thank you very much." " Oh, don't call me Miss Ledgeral, I am not Miss Ledgeral, I am only Miss Helen; and don't thank me, I did nothing but show your letter to father and coax him just a little. He didn't need it much. But I am so glad you have got a place! I hope it will prove the first step to that fortune." Luther colored up  a little, but replied pleasantly, "Oh,   I28        NEVER AGAIN. you may laugh about that fortune, but I can assure you that it is bound to come one of these days. I shall worship the blind goddess so fervently and so persistently that she can't refuse me her favors. I suppose, Miss Helen, I shall never have the pleasure of seeing you again?" continued Luther, despondinglyl "Well, I suppose not; that is, perhaps, not unless-unless Mr. Gainsby should send you up here with some message to father; or unless mother should take it into her head to ask you up here on Christmlas evening. Do you dance?" "I am very fond of it," replied Luther. "We had a danc- ing-master come up from the city and give us lessons, and I had the reputation of being one of his best pupils; but I am not sure that our country style will do here." "Oh yes, never fear, almost anything will do for us young girls. I will tell mamma that you can dance very well. You see that so many young men can't dance, or wondt dance, that we are sometimes very much in want of partners, and we younger girls have to dance together." "But Christmas is a long way off," replied Luther, laugh- ing; "and an invitation that depends upon your mamma, whom I have never seen, and who will naturally have no great inclination to see me, is a very doubtful affair." "That is true," replied Helen, in a tone of affected seri- ousness, at the same time shrugging her shoulders and open- ing her big gray eyes as if the suggested difficulty was in reality insuperable. The next moment she burst into a low carolling laugh, and her golden ringlets danced as if keeping time to the music. "It is true and it is not true. You must know that papa is not the only one in this house who some- times does as I wish. Mamma is always disposed, after a little coaxing, to entertain any suggestion of mine; besides, it is Aunt Shippen who manages- all our small parties, and I could make her invite the great Mogul." "The great Mogul, perhaps," pleasantly replied Luther  "but how about the little Mogul?" "Well, I admit," replied Helen, "that Aunt Shippen's taste I allsas Ir -- -  -,     NVE VER A GAIN.        129 would be rather for the big Mogul, but I know what I can do with her, so I will say good-bye-good-bye until Christmas." Helen made a little motion with her hand. An older or more self-possessed man would at once have construed it into an offer to shake hands, but Luther never thought of subh a thing-he never could have intended such a liberty, oh no, certainly not! The laws, however, of animal magnetism are as powerful as they are mysterious. Instinctively, but very gently, his hand seized her hand, and as he touched the little soft white fingers resting in his grasp, and looked down into the deep gray eyes, he felt very much as if he should like to get down upon his knees and open his heart d deux battants. It speaks something for his sense of proporti9n and propriety to say that he resisted the impulse, swallowed down a big sob, and smiling, turned manfully towards the door, which Joseph stood ready to open for him. "You have heard, Miss Helen,?' he exclaimed quite in the tone and with the air of a practised gallant, "the Scotch phrase, ' It's a far cry to Lochaw.' I can parody it, and say that, in a double sense, it's a far cry to Christmas-not only a far cry, but a hearty cry. Good bye,"-'and the door closed upon Luther, who marched off up Waverley Place, a walking para- dox, a breathing incongruity, a living confutation of the axiom -that two things cannot occupy the same space at the same time: his heart was full of despair and full of hope. And then came the thought that in trying to say something fine he had indulged in an inappropriate and far-fetched conceit, and had made an absurd and ridiculous speech. He did not exactly "writhe .him to and fro," like Satan, "when he first knew pain," but he gave himself a sharp mental thrust. Fool- ish fellow! But who has not at times suffered from the same cause-some flat or foolish speech-some slight breach of etiquette-something at the wrong time or in the wrong way -and the resultant misery quite equalling that from a breach of the decalogue? You never have? My dear sir, allow me : to congratulate you upon your want of sensibility, your self- conceit, and your intense mental stolidity. 9   CHAPTER   VII. A Leader of Fashion-Explanation of American Taste in Dress-Mrs, Struggles and the Art of Snubbing-Mr. Boggs-A Society-Man- An Outside Heresy-A Sudden Fortune-Stichen and Boggs. OU might hunt society all through with the assistance of a full pack of the best-trained, sharpest-sighted, keenest-scented snobs and flunkies to be found in social ken- nels anywhere, and you would not find a more thorough woman of fashion than Mrs. Ledgeral. With a good natural foundation for a few judicious decorative dexterities of art, her face was generally considered handsome. With a fine, full figure, she was universally allowed to be one of the best dressers in her set. Un peu bruyante, loud; as Billy Dugan phrases it, "devilish loud;" but Billy, although formerly one of the best polka dancers in town, and even now one of the most authoritative and exemplary leaders of the German, is something of a blackguard, and very much of a bore, so no- body minds his slang. Besides, American taste in dress is very tolerant of what may be called broad art. It likes strong and decided touches. The reasons for this are evident and twofold. The first is unquestionably the influence of climate; for we see something of the same kind in the aborigines of this country.- An Indian chief not only puts jewels in his ears and around his neck, but he hangs them from his nose, as being more rononce--more decided-as being a bolder thrusting of them not only into his own face, but into the face of all the world. Perroquets, red-birds, and blue-jays furnish his head-plumes I-L.     ir ely  -C- Y1 -I -   NEVEVR A GAIN.          1 -the gaudiest snake-skins and. dyed porcupine-quills gleam amid the folds of his nether garments, and when " en grande tenue" he paints, he does it with no feeble hand. Broad masses of the strongest reds, yellows, and blacks light up with terrific severity the natural beauties of his countenance. The second reason is as unquestionably the very great beauty of American women. In a country where every tenth woman is handsome, and nine-tenths of the remainder pretty, dress may be more strictly regarded in and for itself. A Frenchwoman is compelled to study the becoming. She can- not afford to indulge the whims of a crude and ill-regulated taste, or to follow too rigidly the'edicts of fashion. While conforming in the main, she alters, modifies, and adapts in detail. She submits to the government, but some slight de- viation from the rule, some delicate infraction of law, some gentle, but decided outhreak of independent volition reveals the rebel at heart, and quietly protests against tyranny. It is even said some grand dames have had the courage to sneer openly at the great dictator of the Rue de la Paix, and a good story, hardly credible on this side of the Atlantic, is- told of the Princess Metternich, who, under the shelter of high title and diplomatic rank, had the audacity to walk in and fairly snub his autocratical grandiosity in full conclave just as he was raising that identical glass of wine to his lips.  "Ye veux relever les jpes d panier de Mazdame la Princesse avec des nceuds-de-dentelles blanches," insisted the great man. "Non, Monsieur, vous ne leferez pas de cette maniere: vous mettrez de petits cernes des lilas blancs quejeeprefere." One can tell this story more readily, inasmuch as no one will believe it, any more than they do Kinglake's stories of the Elysee Bourbon, cdn the night of the coup d'etat. On the other hand, the American woman has so much beauty and to spare, that she can afford "To melt herself away in flashing bravery." She alone of all women can afford to sink her personality in the devotee: to kotou, to genuflect, to get down and knock her fine head, or, perhaps, in less metaphorical language, to   132         NE VER A GA IN. trail her skirts nine times a day in the dirt before the over- whelming shekinah of the greatellow Button. "Jump," said the barbarous potentate to one of his officers, on the top of a tower; one moment for a salute, and the next the devoted minion clears the battlement with a bound. "Jump," exclaims the s!1posed  potentate of fashion; and over goes the obedient Anmericaine in a flutter of devotion, and down she comes before our shrinking gaze, a brilliant mass of self-abnegated vanity. But-not she alone. As in the story of the sailor's jump- ing from the yard-arm, it is "follow my leader," until the whole sea of fashion sparkles and foams with :the similarly be-flounced and be-chignoned victims of a rigid and griping conventionality. But for this gregal conformity there is, as'I have said, a cause and an excuse. The American knows that she can dress for the sake of dress. If, in obedience to fashion, she puts large patterns on her petite figure, or shawls on her high shoulders, or festoonr with feathers her round head and short neck, or carries extra flounces with an extra wriggle or with a lumbering and unqualified waddle, or if, with high forehead and large features, she wears her hair as if she had just suc- cessfully run the gauntlet at a Comanche scalp-dance, she knows that her handsome face will still look handsome enough, and that at least her dress is beautiful in, and of, itself. She knows that if it is somewhat unsuited to her style, it is, as Madame de Volorem assures her, according to the latest plates from the Rue Richelieu and the Boulevard des Italiens, and that if it is a little gaudy, or ostentatious, or pretentious, or, in fact, flaunty, or if it is slightly incongruous, in shape, color, or material, with time. and place-in short, if, without being positively a violation of the more patent laws of taste, it indi- cates a certain jejuneness of thought, and delicately hints at a modicum of mental vulgarity, it is nevertheless a' dress that Mrs. Grundy (that is the Mrs. Grundy of our set) wholly approves of, and that not the most fastidious member of tihe ultramarine demi-monde could laugh at or call dowdy.    NEVER AGAINA.         133 Now Mrs. Ledgeral was not merely a good dresser-more Americano-but she was a downright clever woman-clever in both the English and American acceptation of the word- English-clever in that she had good natural talents: nothing wonderful it is true, and no special gifts, but then she had, in addition, an infinitude :of tact, and' tact is to talent like a mug of hot water to a cold razor. Every thin-skinned, strong- bearded man knows what that is. Strap and hone as much as you please, and the miserable thing won't cut, or else draws blood; but steep it, give it a hot bath, hold its back in the gas, heat in any way, and lo! shaving is a luxury-a delight. In this way, Mrs. Ledgeral's tact was, an unfailing, ever-active warmth or glow that kept her mental razors in a state of the finest temper and polish. She was American-clever, too, in that - she liked to indulge, when it was not too inconvenient, in all kindly emotions. She might not fulfil the impossible injunc- tion of loving her enemies, but then she took good care not to hate her friends. She might detest their style of dress, their manters, their gait, their egotistical talk, their affected laugh, their absurd notions -on the great band and cassock question, their non-appreciation of the Rector of St. Cyprian's, and above all their absurd way of dressing and bringing up their children; but she tried to do so as little as possible. She even went so far as to try not to exaggerate the ages of her female friends; and she never did put on more than two or three years at the utmost. She was naturally of a benevolent spirit, and, notwithstanding she patronized St. Luke's Hospi- tal, and was a member of .the Children's Aid Society, and contributed to Home Missions, and the poor of the parish, and the fund for aged and indigent clergymen, not forgetting her monthly dole of a dollar on Communion Sunday, she still, occasionally, indulged herself in the luxury of a little purely private and unostentatious charity. True, Madame Volorem, although she cut and made cheap enough, had a way of running up her bills with the trimmings that rendered it almost impossible to do much in that line, still there was the satisfaction, and, we may add, the sense of merit, arising SI   134        NEVER A GAIN. from a conscious and continually cultivated, although unfor. tunately unsatisfied, desire to alleviate the misfortunes and miseries of the poor--a satisfaction and a sense of merit which always follow, in obedience to a -beautiful law of nature, by which the distance between the wish and the deed is made almost infinitely less when we are to give than when we are to receive. * Mrs. Ledgeral's spirit of charity was by no means confined to her own set. She never wantonly trampled upon the feel- ings of anybody. She had made it a rule never to snub any one when it was not clearly necessary to her own social suc- cess. Not having been born in the purple, her early life had been one of vigorous struggle, some mortifications, but in the end decided success. Emerging from the unfashionable re- specfability of East Broadway, she had fought her way with- an irresistible gallantry to one of the very best positions on the Avenue. Of course she had to snub as well as to be snubbed; of course she had had to look down with scant courtesy on some old friends and acquaintances who would persist in hanging on to her skirts; of course she had had to resort in more than one instance to the doleful brutality of the downright dead cut --there are such stupid people in the world! but for the last dozen years of her society life there had been no occasion for any but the gentler and the kinrder emotions-no excuse for any deviation from a style of suave and honeyed condescension. She had attained position not only in the higher regions Of upper-tendom, but clear up among the ultimate five hundred-way up on the topmost Alp of fashion, where the thin, dry, and pure air, and the scanty but crisp vegetation, are supposed to produce the richest social cream. She no longer dreaded contact with any of the in- ferior races. She could, and actually did, often speak openly, at church, or at the opera, or at concerts, and without any disposition to shrink from observation while doing so, to merely respectable people, and more than once she had in- dulged a kindly reminiscence of youthful days by renewing an acquaintance that had been dropped fort twenty years;   NE VIER A GAIN.          1 lilie later she had got so loose, or rather liberal, in her .code, -so defiant of all authority-that she had been knowne upon vo or three occasions, to invite to her parties people not be- onging to  her ow n or any cognate set--people without the xcuse of distinction of any kind, either as authors, arists, enerals, politicians, or even as seven-ciphered m illtnalres; nerely good people with no better title to the compliment than the bubbling memories of a former friendship, or the accidental recollection of a family relationship. In short, " rs. Ledgeral had become a very fashionable lady, bien repanlu, as the French say, and she used her social power with a degree of moderation, and in general conducted herself with a degree of independence, that her friend and follower, Mrs. Struggles, could not pretend to imitate, even had Mrs. the natural dispositiondto do so. If the word toady was not such an ugly, disageeable wordug it would not inaptly describe the relationship of M rs. Strug- gles to Mrs. Ledgeral-in fact her relationship in general to the social powers that be. Unfortmuately, Mrs. Strugglesi knowledge of the minuter social affiliations was slight. She lacked experience, and she had no intuitiveness. S he looked only at the surface. The irridescence of the infinitely thin pellicle of society dazzled her eyes, and, as she had no pene- tration, she could not, in and by herself, suspect the depths; so it not unfrequently happened that she broe through, or, in less metaphorical language, blundered awfully. Her toady- ism and her superciliousness were sometimes alike misdirected. She fired away vigorously, right and left, but not having that discriminating sense of game which comes to the nouvelle venue only after a hundred social battutimes, or any hereditary knowl- edge of the natural history of fashion, she sometimes, with her impressive politeness, knocked over a noisy tom-tit, on the one hand, and sometimes, with her insolence, ruffled the feathers of a quiet old hen pheasant on theother. Herfriend and patroness had had frequent occasions to scold her for he  I am quite provoked with you, my dear Mrs. Struggles,"   136        NE VER AGAIN.           said Mrs. Ledgeral, the morning after a small entertainment, as they sat in Mrs. Ledgeralzs boudoir-the small room over the hall, hung in blue and gold; "I am quite provoked with you!" "Oh! my dear Mrs. Ledgeral, how? why? what?" ex. claimed Mrs. Struggles, a look of deprecatory obsequiousness mantling her round rouged and befrizzled face. "Quite provoked," continued Mrs. LedgeTl; "I don't know really that I can continue to-to"-'patronize,' Mrs. Ledgeral was going to say, but checked herself in time-" to advise-to assist you, if you go on as you do. You have no discrimination ; or if you think you have, you discriminate badly. I took special pains last night to present you to Mrs. Van der Toozle, and you scarcely spoke two words to her. You were a great deal more polite to those Pushtons. You think, because you see them round everywhere, that they are people of some influence. Their influence can do nothing for you, my dear. They have need of it all to keep themselves afloat. I don't say but that they may be of some-consequence in time, for the Lord only knows what New York society is coming to,--but, now, you had better have one nod of approval from Mrs. Van der Toozle than a dozen smiles from the Pushtons." "What! that plain-looking woman with the big nose and i the maroon satin?" demanded Mrs. Struggles. "Why, I have never seen her out anywhere, and she didn't seem to know any one. I did not dream that she was anybody. Is she so very rich?" "No," curtly replied Mrs. Ledgeral. "Is she very fashionable then?" demanded Mrs. Strug- gles. "No," returned Mrs. Ledgeral.            Mrs. Struggles thrust her hands into her muff, and grasped her card-case to suppress her emotion, while her queer gray' eyes alone gave expression to her mingled astonishment and curiosity. "'She is not at all what you would call a fashionable   NEVER AGAIN.          137 woman," said Mrs. Ledgeral; " she entertains but little, and goes out but little; but she is a Van der Toozle, and the Van der Toozles were Van der Toozles before the Anglo-Saxon conquest of New Amsterdam and the defeat of Peter Stuy- vesant by tlNe English armada.  She has what Hamilton Boggs calls ' the latent potentiality of fashion.' She could spread herself indefinitely any moment she should see fit. There are a good many such women in New York society-- either subsided ci-devant fashionables, or women with hered- '     social claims; women of decided position; circum- itary social claims; women     collect that it scribed position, it is true; but you must rec quires less money, time, and labor to amplify a position than it does to achieve one. It don't do, my dear Mrs. Struggles, for a person like you to go round snubbing everybody whom you don't know indiscriminately." "( That is a fact," exclaimed a spruce, middle-aged young fellow, as he quietly slipped into the half-open door without a word of warning to the ladies, " that is a fact, you might snub angels unawares.  h, Mr. Boggs, is that you ? I am glad to see you," said Mrs. Ledgeral. "es; I knewl.  youreceived nobody this morning, so, as I am nobody, I thought I would come in and sit with you a little while; but you were lecturing Mrs. Struggles upon the art of snubbing.

Mr. Boggs was a society-man. He was not so young as x he had been. You could see that in the nicely brushed, but somewhat scanty chevelure. A luxuriant mustache adorned his upper lip, but there were no side whiskers. Wicked peo- ple said that it was to avoid the trouble of dyeing that he kept his cheeks closely shaved. Decidedly, Mr. Boggs was not so young as he had been; but, during all the flitting years from youth to this stand-still age, he had always been a so- ciety-man. It is acurious fact, unnoted by anatomists and embryolo- gists in relation to any other animal, that the state of arrested development in the society-man always merges directly into a state of arrested decay. A certain point once reached, there is apparently no change. Life seems in this case to violate the laws that so universally govern it elsewhere. The flood of vitality refuses to ebb; but remains at high tide despite the changes of the sun and moon. Many instances have been known where a thorough-bred society-man, after reaching., thirty-five, has remained at precisely the same age for twenty- five years, and even after that it sometimes takes the acute' eyes of a youthful generation to perceive the first stria and macula of fossiliferous action. There are people, however, who pretend to doubt whether I the veritable society-man is found among us. But why not?  The turbot has been, and is now, occasionally, taken in-Am eri- can waters. If this be true, no one need to doubt that the society-man, who is so largely the product of European insti- tutions, should be found on this side also. Here we have all the -elements for his development, except, perhaps, a titled aris- tocracy. We have counteracting influences, it is true, but they cannot act upon everX individual with equal force. Some few escape and become society-men in obedience to Darwin's   NEVER AGAIN.         I139 law of the survival of the fittest. We have a wide and mag- nificent field for all activities. We have work enough for all, rich and poor. We have fortunes to be made, and imperative private and public duties to be performed. We have, it is to be hoped,-for on this point one must speak with some doubt, -a slowly expanding national and social sentiment; but with all this we have the society-man ; the society-man pure and simple, the society-manpar excelence. One must not suppose that by this term is meant merely the social man who likes society for its -own sake; or the worn working-man who prescribes society to himself as a regimen; and who doses himself with a ball or a dinner-party precisely as a dyspeptic swallows a pill or potion; or a man who is driven into society by his wife, or by a sense of duty to his family, in order that he may share the burden and heat of the day, and keep up, with what grace he can, his end of the social load; or the 'man who goes into society to dance, to sing, to flirt, or to lookl after a wife. The society-man proper, in general, won't dance, can't sing, don't flirt, at least to hurt any, except when some ex- ceedingly silly woman helps him, and only fully intends to marry when some great heiress jumps into his arms. The society-man is his own final cause; he is a society-man be- cause he is a society-mian. Now it may be doubted by careless observers whether we have the true society-man on this side of the Atlantic ; but as has bqen said, it is asserted that the turbot is sometimes found on the American coast, and one of the best authorities on pisiculture' goes so far as' to say that we have white-bait here. If so, why shouldn't we have the society-man? Hamilton Boggs was a society-man, but, perhaps, not a pure and simple specimen. It would be doing undoubted injustice to the class to call him simply a society-man. By a strange anomaly, Hamilton Bdggs, although a society-man, had a good deal of common sense in his composition, which not all the glamour of the great ineffable Bosh had wholly ob- scured. There was a philosophic streak running' through his   I- 40        NE VER AGAIAN. mental constitution. He was an observer, and .a thinker. He saw the faults and follies and failings of fashionable so. ciety; but he saw what none of its votaries, and few of its detractors do see-its utilities, its capacities, its merits, its ex. cuses, and its justifications. He saw that it is the natural and necessary result of social causes ; that even its inanities are the legitimate product of human thought. He saw that fash. ion is not a .mere matter of caprice, changeable at the will or wish of any individual, however powerful,-that even fashions of dress, apparently the result of mere whim, have their intimate and inseparable relations to former fashions, and are governed by laws founded on the constitution of the human mind, subtle, yet rigid, and as yet hardly suspected by scien- tific men. In short, Boggs had begun to see that there is a philosophy of fashion, and he had formed for himself certain theories which he occasionally ventilated in a somewhat slangy style. "Go on, I beg of you, my dear Mrs. Ledgeral," continued Mr. Boggs; " there is no subject that I know of more inter- esting than the snub, if properly treated, especially from the philanthropic and Christian point of view. Don't you think so, Mrs. Struggles?" "I don't know what Christianity has to do with it," sill- pered Mrs. Struggles. "Don't you-? I am afraid you don't read your Bible, my dear Mrs. Struggles, as closely as you ought. The good book has many fine examples." "Oh, Mr. Boggs, how absurd." "There is one," continued Mr. Boggs, unheeding the in- terruption, "I have always admired. Ah, Mrs. Struggles, if you could only always imitate that,-and I do not intend any irreverence in alluding to it,--it would put you at once at the very head of society." "Indeed!" exclaimed Mrs. Struggles; "do tell me! what book? what chapter? what verse? what are the words?" "' Get thee behind me, Satan.'" "Oh., Mr. Boggs, how cU you be so absurd?"   NE VER A GAIAT,        141 "Well, it is absurd to suppose that any one in this age could treat the old boy so disrespectfully, so we will go back to snubs in general. The subject is both interesting and ab- struse, and I want to hear Mrs. Ledgeral's exposition of it." "You will get no exposition of it from me," said Mrs. Ledg- eral; " I only ventured a remark to Mrs. Struggles upon the impolicy of indiscriminate snubbing. X If you want an analysis of the art, I know no one who can make it better than your-., self, Mr. Boggs.''" "You flatter me; but, to tell the truth, I fancy I do under- stand the subject; and some day I am going to write an arti-i cle in the Social Science oarnzal, for the enlightenment of the climbing barbarians. I will send you a\ copy of it, Mrs.  Struggles." "Oh, I shall be so much obliged," said Mrs. Struggles; "you know I have often been indebted to Mrs. Ledgeral and yourself for good advice, and I assure you I am not above trying to learn. I don't want to snub too much,'or in the wrong place; but one must snub sometimes, you know-there are so many common people in society-so much shoddy, you know." Mr. Boggs stared steadily at Mrs. Struggles for at least a minute and a half with an expression of interest and curiosity resembling that which would undoubtedly animate the coun- tenance of Agassiz over a nondescript crinoid or ascidian. "Don't you think so? "demanded Mrs. Struggles ; the% are so many very common people with nothing but money; and money, you know, can do anything." Mr. Boggs took another long steady stare at Mrs. Strug- gles, uttered a gentle sigh, and shook his head dubiously. "My dear Mrs. Ledgeral," he exclaimed, "you should not allow your friend, our friend," with a slight bow to Mrs. Struggles, "-to talk in this way." "I don't care," exclaimed Mrs. Struggles, bristling up; " it's true, all the world knows it is true. Look at the Seltons, they were just nobodiesl until the old man made a million in leather. And look at the Higgletons. Wasn't her father a   "2  -NE VVER AGAIN. butcher? And wasn't she nowhere until Slicky Higgleton made a fortune by failing five times in cotton? Look at her now--who goes to her parties? Don't-the Macjimpseys and the Rammerdans and the De Belleverts, and the Montebellos go? Why, at her last musicale I saw you, Mr. Boggs, very industriously stuffing Kate Higgleton with boned turkey and champagne. You know that there is not a girl in society that gets more attention. It's all money." "An outside heresy, my dear Mrs. Struggles, an outside heresy, which I am sorry to see that you have fallen into. And besides, you mistake the question, or rather confound two questions. Nothing personal, my dear Mrs. Struggles-it is characteristic of the female mind in general. But be so good a- -to keep distinctly this division-first, the influence of money in getting in, and secondly, the importance of money after you have got in. Money is important, in the first case, but it is a great mistake to suppose that it is omnipotent. There is, probably, no country where money--mere money, or 'rather the mere sentimental aura and emanation of a vast pile of money, has less power both in politics and society than here. It is at the best only one of the four Bs. It is neces- sary always to have two, and in most cases three, of the four, Bs, to develop any- social force." "The four Bs!" exclaimed Mrs. Struggles. "What can they be?" "Oh, it's nothing but some of Mr. Boggs' nonsense," in- terrupted Mrs. Ledgeral. But Mrs. Struggles' curiosity was excited, and she steadily looked her inquiry. "The four Bs, my dear Mrs. Struggles? Well, the four, Bs are the essentials of social success. .The four Bs are . Blood, Brains, Brass, and Brads. You see, in some cases two -L , of them will do; as, for instance, blood and brads; -but brads alone will -never do. Even brads and brass is generally a  failure; but brads, brass, and brains is a very happy and  irresistible composition. Now I think, when you come to examine the case of the Seltons or the Higgletons or the      E EVER AGAIN.         143 Inersley's, you will find something besides brads-say an enormous quantity of brass, and no small amount of brains." 'a And by brads, of course,' you mean"- "Tin."    ( "Tin?" "Yes, or pewter; just as you please to call it." "Pshaw, Mr. Boggs; you mean money." "Well, that is the vulgar name for it. But whatever you call it, I don't mean to question its power when properly used, and I am going to give you an instance of it. My friend Stichen has just made a million. I've stepped in this morn- ing, Mrs. Ledgeral, to speak to you about it." "To me, Mr. Boggs! what have I to do with it? I never heard of Stichen. I don't know him." "No, and I don't want you to know him ; but, as I have said, he has just made his million. You see he has been for some time quietly rolling up a fortune in what he calls the manufactured linen line; making money slowly and deliber- i ately, however, is no great merit. Thousands do that without entitling them to any social distinction. But Stichen is a genius. He conceived a grand idea, and last year he de- spatched a diplomatic agent to the chief of the Gran Chaco. The chief was so pleased with a present of a dozen lace-ruffled bosoms for himself that he listened, and finally became con- verted to the doctrine that his subjects ought to wear shirts. Stichen got the contract for the supply of all the red rovers between the Paraguay and the foot of the Andes, and he has just sold out his contract for a round million to a company of gentlemen in Chathamni Street, to be called the Grand South American Shemial Supply Company.  From  this instant Stichen shuts up shop. I went to Stichen, and I said, 'Stichen, how about that little account that has been running on between us so long? I hear that you are going to shut up shop.'" "'Yes, I am going-to give up the manufactured linen busi- ness. I am not only going to shut up shop, but I am going to sink the shop. I am going to abandon all retail associations.'   "4        NEVE'R AGAIN. '.-i '-Well Stichen,' said I, 'I don't know that that is so easy, certain associations stick; you know what the poet says: '"You may break, you may smash both the counter and till, But the odor of retail will hang round you still."' Stichen is, or rather was, a vulgar little man, but he looked at me with an expression of dignified acuteness which I hawe never seen surpassed. It was something stupendous. It would have adorned the visage of a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, or the countenance of a street broker who has just made a successful turn of a hundred shares of Erie. "/You have read Presc6tt's Conquest of Mexico?' said he. "' I have,' said I. "'Well, do you know what was the greatest thing Cortez did?' "I hesitated, "I'll tell you,' said he; ' it was burning his ships! I have imitated him.' "'You have?' said I. "I have,' said he. ' Standing' upon the shore of a new world, with the distant mountains of finance and fashion before me, I have burntviny books.' "' And my account?' said I. "' Is in ashes,' said he.. "' Stichen,' said I, ' give me your hand. You are a genius, if ever there was one.' "Stichen extended his hand with as much dignity as if he had been for twenty years a wholesale commission mer- chant. Not a smile on his face, which used to be one univer. sal smirk. "'I have a favor to ask of you,' said he. "'Anything I can possibly do for you, my dear Mr. Stichen,' I replied. "'Well, I want you to call and see my wife.

Well, she went to those fellows and they did her good; but now that I have got plenty of money she is going in for fashion, and I am going in for finance. She will want a little advice in the one case, which I will be willing to return in the other. Go and see her. You will find her grateful for any sugges- tions.' " "And did you go?" exclaimed both ladies in a breath, as Mr. Boggs paused in his narrative. Mr. Boggs nodded his head. "Some vulgar, dowdy thing!" exclaimed Mrs. Struggles. "No," replied Mr. Boggs,. "Lacks style somewhat, and don't know how to dress yet; but she has given unlimited orders to Madame Volorem, and I shall take good care to tone her down a little. As to her house, nothing can be finer. I arrived just in time to save her dining-room from a dingy maroon. 'Don't do it,' said I; ' never mind what Magnet says; that thing is done to death, and it weighs upon the di- gestion. Give us something light and lively in the 'eating way; and so a soft orange, panelled with a delicate purple, and half-a-dozen pictures of game, fruit, and flowers, will shed a sparkle on the festive scene.' No, she is not vulgar-that is, she is not as vulgar as many of our folks; as Mrs. De Vine or as Mrs. Fain, for instance." to   "6        NEVER A GAIN. "Oh, Mr. Boggs!" exclaimed Mrs. Struggles, "how can you call Mrs. De Vine and Mrs. Fain vulgar? Why, they are two of the most fashionable women in society." "I do not say that they are not fashionable," replied Mr. Boggs; "I only said they are vulgar-mentally vulgar, I mean. Did you ever hear either of them talk five minutes without in. troducing that dinner to the Marquis, or that beautiful ball at t. Doria palace, when 'young Odiscalchi asked to be intro. duced to Tilly, and came up to her, and said, "Miss Fain, will you do me the honor to dance with me in the next set?"\ in just as good English as possible, and without the least accent. But Tilly was engaged to the handsome Cenci, and she was so sorry, and I nudged Tilly, and says I, "Speak Htalian," and Tilly said, "Ah! tantegrazieper l'alto onore / mza davvero /! meie duole; non mi 6possibile di aceettare l'onorerole invito ; sono gid in- pegnata per tutte He altredanze." And young Odiscalchi smiled as pleasantly as possible, and he turned to me and said, -"Mrs. Fain, your daughter speaks Italian charmingly. Our old phrase, ' Zingua Toscana in bocca Romara,' will have to be changed into ' bocca Americana."' And Tilly looked so pleased, but didn't say anything; and I nudged her again and whis- pered to her that she ought to thank him for such a compli- ment, but she wouldn't, and I had to do it in English. '" Mr. Boggs was something of a mimic, and both ladies laughed at the close imitation. "Well, now," resumed Mr. Boggs, "Mrs. Stichen is not vulgar, for there is no vulgarity without' pretension, or rather pretentiousness, and she is not ignorant-that is, not as ig- norant as the Misses Wadkins, or Sally Chorly. She knows who painted Mr. Dusseldorf's pictures, and when I spoke of Lady Geraldine's courtship she didn't mistake it for one of Moore's melodies, or think I meant Jimmy Doolittle's spoony bout at Milan and Cadenabia with that fast Irish peeress." "But, Mr. Boggs," interposed Mrs. Struggles, "how can you call the Misses Wadkins ignorant?   Wlhy they know everybody in town; they play and sing; they have been to Paris, and they speak French beautifully, and they drawl oh   C. .AE EVER A GAIN.         147 yes, they draw wonderfully.

"Oh, Mr. Boggs! never heard of the Venice de Medici?-" "Never; I have heard of the Florence di Medici, but never of the Venice."         o Mrs. Ledgeral shook her finger at Mr. Boggs. "Well, I admit," he continued, "that the Wadkins know a good deal; they know the Bois thoroughly, and have been presented at the Tuilleries, and danced the cotillion half-a-- dozen times apiece with the Prince Vascoutch and the Mar- quis de la Roche Gammon. I don't know but I am wrong in calling them ignorant. There is a great deal of very useless knowledge in the world, but perhaps it is just as well to have a kind of an-idea that Childe Harold wasn't written by Shake- speare; and that Browning the poet and Browning the butcher in Clinton market, where pa buys his beef,are two different persons. "But, as I was saying, Mrs. Stichen is not ignorant; I have examined her. ' Let us see,' said I, ' Mrs. Stichen, what you know. Do you know that the square of the hypothenuse of a right-angled triangle equals the sum of the squares of the two sides?' 'I don't,' said she, ' and I didn't know that it was necessary to know it. I never supposed there were any squares or triangles in society. I thought there were nothing but circles.' And she looked so demure you would never have thought-well, I can't say that butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, for she has just that ripe, warm, luscious-looking couth that you'd think butter would melt in it, and that very quickly. "'Mrs. Stichen,' said I, 'you'll do. I'll be hanged if I don't take you up in earnest.' And now, my dear Mrs. Ledg- eral, that is just what I have come about this morning.. I want to know, if Mrs. Stichen calls upon you, whether you will return her call and put her name upon your visiting-list. You   I 48        NE VER A GAIN see Stichen is a sensible fellow, and he has promised never to show himself. Mrs. Stichen has a good voice, and I a. going to work the musical dodge for her. She wants a little training, but Albetus says, that with her great natural capa. bility, he can put her in good order for at least two or three songs in about three months. Her voice is a rich round con- tralto; none of your squeaky sopranos." , "Well, suppose I should give a musicale, Mr. Boggs, and bring her out for you??" "Thank you, but that won't do," replied Mr. Boggs. "I am going to do the fair thing by her. I have promised Stichen, and I mean to keep my word. I am not going to have her get into the musical notch and stick there. I am not going to allow her to go into society to sing for-her ptrons. I am going to fix it so that, being' in society, she will occasionally sing to gratify her friends. There is a difference, you know, and if Mrs. Ledgeral will promise to return her call, that, is all I ask just at present." "With great pleasure, Mr, Boggs," replied Mrs. Ledgeral. "You somewhat pique my curiosity, and, as you say she is presentable, I shan't mind introducing her to Aunt Shippen, and perhaps to Mrs. De Billivert." " Oh, thank you, Mrs. Ledgeral, you are very kind. Those two will do, but not another one if you have any regard for me. I don't want to sprawl her all over society at once. She'd spread out too thin. Better wait a little. Society is a monster that must be delicately tickled into an appetite for a fresh morsel. It is a whirlpool, and it is better to be sucked in than to be pushed in. You glide into the very vortex more gently and surely." "Well, just as you say, Mr. Boggs. you are a first-rate 'engineer, and can manage your, or anybody's, social loco- motive as well as any one I know. I shall watch your opera- tions with interest, and in the meantime you may be sure that I shall return her call." "Well, then, your reception-day next week will see about as pretty a pair of brown bays at your door as you can find in   ArEVE:R iAGAINV.        149 town. I selected them, with clarence, coachman and call-boy, all myself,'-carte blanche, you know, from Stichen. I shall be on hand. A4u revoir," and Mr. Boggs lounged from the room. "And do you really mean to take up this Mrs. Stichen, my dear Mrs. Ledgeral?" demanded Mrs. Struggles. It is characteristic of the struggling woman that, while clinging with desperate clutch to the middle rounds' of the ladder of fashion, she has the capacity of directing her vision with equal intensity in directly opposite directions above and below; one eye, beaming with hope and ambition, turns prayer- fully upward, with its tears of faith and devotion,--the veri- table pearls of social piety,-glistening in the effulgence of the great ineffable Bosh; the other, gleaming with scorn and jealousy, flashes darkly downward upon the sacrilegious wretch who has dared to raise herself out of the mud and mire of common vulgar respectability by so much as a single step on the first fashionable rung. ' If I were you, my dear Mrs. Ledgeral, I don't think that I would notice her. I don't cake if she is accomplished and handsome and well-mannered and lady-like, she is very low; and as for her music, it would be a great deal better, to get the professionals to sing for you-you know you can do that for nothing, very often, if you only flatter them a little- than to receive such people. I think it very wrong that peo- ple in society should be called upon to compromise them- selves with all these common people." "Compromise! Mrs. Struggles, " demanded Mrs. Ledg- eral; %what do you mean by that?" 'Oh, I don't mean that you could be compromised," replied Mrs. Struggles; " you can do anything, but I don't see the use of really taking up such a woman, and bringing her right in. It is hardly fair. Why look at Mrs. Highton. She went through six years of snubs before she could do anything worth speaking of. Lord! just to think of what that woman endured at Sharon and Newport. And now Mr. Boggs wants to jump this Mrs. Stichen right over everything. I don't see   150        -NEVER AGAIN. the use, my dear Mrs. Ledgeral, of taking her up. There are getting to be so many common people-in society now--so much shoddy. Why should you do it?" "Well, I don't know," said Mrs. Ledgeral; " pozr me'amuser and to oblige Mr. Boggs. Besides, Boggs is a pretty good judge of music, and he says she has a good'voice. Now, with good looks, a good voice' plenty of money, and Mr. Boggs to engineer matters for her, ten chances to one that in a season or two she takes a position." "She may spread herself among the upper ten thousand," replied Mrs. Struggles, in an anxious tone, "but do you really think, my dear Mrs. Ledgeral, that she will make her way into the highest circle-the ultimate five hundred--your set, and, thanks to your kindness, I may say, our set?" "Perhaps, that is if she takes a turn or two at Sharon and Newport; quietly and modestly attacks society in detail; don't invite a combination against her by running after the men too much at first, and don't try to give a grand party too  soon, so as to allow society to get her down into one of those awful social ruts that it is so difficult to get-out of. But Hamilton Boggs knows all the pit-falls, and can pull all the strings. She's lucky in having such an adviser. I shouldn't wonder if he should make her a downright rage before he gets through with her. You recollect what a wonderful belle his sister was for two seasons; but I forget, you could not have known anything about it, for that was five or six years ago. Well, no girl ever made more noise., Twice a week, a serenade that'disturbed the whole neighborhood, and the biggest anonymous bouquets ever known. She was the talk of our set. Two or three times copies of verses got into the Herald, and Boggs threatened to flog the editor. He never did, but I know that he has a knack at rhymes, and I know that he paid Himmerman three thousand dollars for music, and only the other day Mackenzie, the florist, told me that Boggs owed three hundred dollars balance on an old account. The second season there was a dead set at her, but Tim Bur- ling' came in and carried her off with his three millions. Oh, Boggs can do the thin, if any one can."   NE VER AGAIN.         151 "Well, then," said Mrs. Struggles, with a sigh, "I shall be here on Tuesday, and eou must introduce me." Mrs. Struggles took ier leave, and was giving orders to her coachman to drive home, when suddenly she changed her mind. "What if I call at once?" said she. I'll do its! I can say that my friend Boggs bad so much interested me in her that I had resolved not to stand upon ceremony."  It is best, thought Mrs. Struggles, when you can't keep people out, to make a flourish of cordiality, and rush at once to open the door. A happy thought, original and profound, wherein lies a hint to prime ministers, legislators, and poli- ticians of every degree. , a;-   CHAPTER VIII. Slippery and Sloppy-A Street Adventure-The Old Frenchwoman- Timely Aid-Luther's Gallantry-A Vista of Unlimited French and German. T was the last half hour of a chill winter's day. A leaden i sky abo\e; a sluggy, dingy-white carpet of snow below; no animation, no buoyancy in the moisture-laden air,-anon, a perceptible decrease of temperature. The fitful blasts that whistled round the corners of the streets opening to the North River became more and more aciculated. The hurry- ing crowds in Broadway drew their coats and cloaks closer as they passed the exposed crossings. His day's duties done, Luther with rather deliberate step was wending his way to Broome Street; there was nothing so very inviting in Miss Jones' mahogany and horse-hair- furnitured parlors, and the dark, dumb anthracite stove, that he should quicken his steps beyond the rate dictated by the natural impulses of a healthy circulation and a vigorous innervation. He paused for a few moments at two or three of the shop windows, and his fancy strode round and round the world, on the hints of some silks and satins, one or two cashmere shawls, some articles of bijoutryt and virtu. He lingered at some of the crossings and looked down the bleak streets and across the long line of closely-packed spars and masts and steam funnels-in his mind not merely the iron and wooden instruments and adjuncts of sordid trade, but the symbols of the richest romance; the dashes and exclamation points emphasiz- ing the boldest enterprise, the wildest and most fascinating adventure. He stopped on the corner of Franklin Street, and,   NE VER- AGAIN.         153 in the instinctive bravado 6f youthful hardihood, turned his ruddy cheeks to the blast. It was no mere wind from Hobo- ken or Weehawken that saluted him, as it did the thousands of passers. It was the very breath of the pole, and bore on its chill wings the grumblings of the grinding ice-fields, the crushings of colliding bergs, the cracklings of the aurora and the last sighs of Franklin and his men. At this moment he was sensible of a curious phenomenon; it was growing colder, and yet it seemed to be growing warmer. As the sloppy slush of the streets began'to freeze, a pleasant warmth was radiated from the hardening mass. Heat, latent in the liquid, streamed out from the hold of the griping crystals, and diffused itself through the chill air. He had often noticed the same thing before, and thoroughiy com- prehended the rationale of the phenomenon, but the fact had never struck him so forcibly. It suggested itself now as a good illustration of the principle of compensation, and he thought of the story of the old soldier reproving his comrades, grumbling around their Russian bivouac, with his nous avions chaud'en Egypte ily a vihng ans. "Yes, yes," exclaimed Luther, forgetting the crowds, and suddenly speaking in quite a loud voice; "Yes, il y a tou- jours comensalion, mon ami." "Quoi! Que dites vous /" suddenly demanded a female voice at his side. The speaker was a little withered woman of some fifty or fifty-five years of age. She was shabbily, but still sufficiently, clad, in an old black silk cloak; streaked and frayed and faded; and with here and there a downright hole or rent through which peeped the dingy wadding. On her head she wore an old velvet hat, evidently dating from the days when, in the matter of female head-gear, a liberal and, generous fashion prevailed, and exhibiting in the crushed and seamed pile the indications of ancient splendor, but-guiltless at the moment of any effort at adornment,-not a speck of feather, flower or ribbon, except the crumpled snuff-tinted strings that confined it. A pair of thick india-rubber shoes protected her    feet, and added an appearance of comfort if not of elegance to her toilet-an appearance that was heightened by a warm but somewhat mussy victorine of cat-skin that encircled her neck, each particular hair of which, standifout in its own particular way, seemed still to speak of the desperate battle with brutal bull terriers ia which poor grimalkin had lost her life. She stretched out from beneath her cloak a small and del- icately formed hand, covered with a new and nicely-fitting glove, of a pure pearl tint, and touched Luther on the arm. There was still light enough to reveal the incongruity. So shabby and forlorn, and yetganyt d nzerveille in Duprez's best I What could it mean? It could not be purely accidental. No, in some way it indicated an iniection of sentiment into the overlying shales and conglomerates of real life, or, per- haps, better, an outcrop of feeling from mysterious psycholog- ical depths. Luther hlead been listening to a popular lecture on geology the evening before, and as the metaphor flashed upon him, he chuckled slightly with the usual pleasurable pangs of figurative parturition. The little hand flashed for a moment in Luther's sight, pressed his arm with a finger's weight for an instant, and then disappeared like a shooting star in the clouds of the old black cloak. "Quoi!" she exclaimed. "Que  riles vous? ozU s Hes Fran'ais? Xon, non--jee  e tlromne, pardon, ardon. Qw je sais bgte," and she turned away suddenly, muttering to her- self, and walked off with rapid, but somewhat uncertain step. Luther, a little startled and a good deal amused, had no time to frame a reply, but as she was going up Broadway he resumed his walk, and followed her. The  sklippery-sloppy slush had by this time changed into a  rough but still more slippery ice, compelling even thefirmest- footed pedestrians to pick their way with care. And now the big india-rubber shoes stood the little old woman in good stead. Without them she could hardly have gone half-a-dozen yards from the spot where she had accosted Luther, but with   them she had successfully achieved a block and more, when suddenly even their assistance proved insufficient. She slip- ped, caught her balance for an instant, slipped again, and fell heavily. her full length. A portly German was a little ahea'- at this instant. He glanced backward, butthe was under 1oo much headway to stop; besides, she was nothing but a woman, somebody else could help her up, and, more than that, per- haps she might not want anybody to help her up. -A French- man was just passing. He, too, could not stop. It is true she was a woman; but she was no acquaintance, and moreover she was a shabby woman, and neither a young woman nor a pretty woman ; but, with true French politeness, he instinct- ively touched his hat. Luckily the assistance of these gen- tlemen was not necessary, as Luther was but a step or two behind, and rushing up, raised the little woman from the ground. "You are not much hurt?" he demanded. "No ; I have not broke the back or the neck--mais- the foot--the what you call the ankle. Well, I am much under some obligation to you. Good-bye, sir," and the old woman paused and examined her gloves, soiled and rent by their violent contact with the rough pavement. A flush of anger, almost the only emotion she had exhib- ited, mantled her face, and Luther heard a slight hiss and a prolonged but almost-inaudible roll of double r-r's deep down in her throat. She turned, took a step or two, but evidently with so much difficulty, that Luther was again by her side. "You had better let me assist you," he exclaimed; "the walking is very bad, very dangerous. Here, take my arm. Have you far to go?" The old woman threw her head back, and fastened a pair of piercing black eyes upon Luther's face. "Have you ever seen me before?" she demanded. "Never," replied Luther. "Did you ever hear of Madame Steignitz?" she demanded. "I never have had that pleasure," answered Luther."    ,." ,       rv v H As Ut lIV. "And you offer your arm to a poor old woman like me,- in Broadway,-and the daylight not all gone away)? Me! poor, old, sale, mal haillee--what you call shabby! Alloons, --let us go," and the old woman put her arm within Luther's. "Comme il est brave, cegarona,' she muttered. "Ah! comme il est fort aussi," she continued, as Luther, with vigor- ous arm, supported her over a particularly difficult and slip- pery piece of pavement. Luther became sensible that a good many curious and wondering glances were directed at him and his companion. But what of it; why should he care? Even when he saw, ad- vancing to meet him, a fellow-member of Miss Jones' family, --a young bank-clerk, with whom he was on familiar terms,- he had no disposition to shrink from the encounter. "Hollo! old fellow," exclaimed his acquaintance, " what's up? Just landed, eh?" Catching sight at this moment of the old woman's face,.he checked his chaff in mid-volume, but, as he passed, he nrde a comical grimace, gave Luther a mocking salutation, and, as he pretended to raise his hat, touched his nose with his thumb, and flourished his fingers in the air. The keen black eyes were fastened upon Luther's face. He could not help coloring up a little, but it was more, with anger than with shame. Why should he feel ashamed?, Confound  the fellow! Luther never did really like him. "Let him laugh. Giving one's arm to a poor old woman isn't wrong, is it? and why should it be thought ridiculous? But is it ridiculous? No; it can't be ridiculous. But if it really is ridiculous, what then? Why shouldn't a fellow make himself ridiculous sometimes when he knows he's right? If  he makes himself ridiculous when he knows he's wrong! Ah! that is another thing." And Luther's thoughts ran back past his steamboat adventure, to the days of Miss Deborah Doo- little. "Yes, you're a brave," exclaimed the old woman. "Je voudrais bien savoir sa pens'e," she muttered to herself Luther made no reply; lost in thought he mechanically    NEVER AGAIN.   I57   occupied himself in assisting his companion's footsteps, and together they walked two or three blocks in silence. "Tell me what of you think!" suddenly exclaimed the old woman. Luther smiled. "Oui! oui! de quoi pensez vous? Tell me." Luther laughed outright. "I was thinking," he said, "of a remark of an old friend of mine." "Repeat it to me." "You would hardly understand it." "Do you think so? Let me tell you I comprehend the English perfectly Wvell." "Yes, and you speak it very purely, but my friend's remark was in English of the sea, and not English of the land." "Never mind, repeat it to me." Luther laughed again, as the little woman reiterated her order in a peremptory tone. "Well," replied Luther, "he was talking about people being afraid of being laughed at. He sa/id that he never knew a lubber who was afraid of being laughed at turn out a good seaman. He might learn to slush a spar, clean the pig- sty, or milk the Captain's goat, but you couldn't depend upon him to haul out the' weather earing in a nor'-wester./'" "And you was think of that-ah! ah! I comprehend, parfailement 'en.!' parfaitement bien! Your sea friend will say that if a young gentlem/n, beau, brave, bien mnis gives his arm to a poor old shabby Frenchwoman in Broadway, he must not be afraid of the laugh. tIa! ha! Bien, bien, qfu'il ria? nous verrons, nous verrons. This is my street," she sud- denly exclaimed as they reached the head of Houston Street, "but you go not yet, you shall come with me to my apart- ment. Where do you live?" Luther hesitated. He had felt impelled to give her the sup- port of his arm for the time, but he was by no means certain that he desired to form any permanent friendly relations with her. She might possibly prove a disreputable acquaintance;    ,3   ,   ) NaE VER AGAIN . - she might, and very probably would, prove a disagreeable one. Still there was a tone of decision and authority in her way of putting her queries that Luther'was unable to resist, and there was something in the expression of her flashing black eyes and her mobile mouth, in fact in her whole air and man. ner, that piqued curiosity and excited interest. Why should he not gowith her? The cross-streets were even more slippery than Broadway, and it would be such a terrible misfortune for the poor old thing to break any of her bones. "You live in Bleecker Street? Good! we are neighbors I live in Wooster Street close by;  s don. I shall not take you much out of your way-un petit 'as deps. Ah, here we are-nous sormmes catrries.          - The speaker stopped at one of, a row of old-fashioned and rather dilapidated two-story houses with dormer windows. The worn and battered door stood open, disclosing the bare and dirty boards of the hall floor, and a rickety, carpetless Staircase.  The fractured balusters; the broken plaster of the side walls exposing the splintered lathing; the flutter of old rags chinking the broken fanlights; and the vista of a sloppy yard filled with dirt-heaps, headless and hoopless barrels, old tubs, and broken crockery, made a fine subject for a picture for some  of the great masters of genre, but which Luther failed to appreciate. f Ah, I understand," said Mr. Whop- pers, as Luther was describing to him the scene, "more homely than homey." "Come   in! come in! I insist! ':said the old woman, as Luther helped her up the steps; "you have been too good not to give me the pleasure of your company for a few moments more." Luther could not refuse. His cumiosity was excited, and any doubts as to the danger or impropriety of the adventure were quieted by the sight of a group of dirty children in the hall, andvthe signs of an ho t cobbler in the front base, ment windows. "This house is mine," said e eold woman as she led the/ way up-stairs; "but I  have no need for the whole.

Hemay be a great inventor, but--I must have my rent!  "What countryman is he?" demanded Luther. "Il est Americain, je crois.  Je n'en suis pas sure; but I think; because I speak to him French and German--he does not comprehend both too well. But he is not like the Amer- icans. He studies all night. He files the brass and the iron, and he makes the wood in the what you call it--e tour--the lathe all day. He does not eat, he does not talk; he thinks --he thinks all the time; he lives in a state of maussaderie incroyab\e,-all what you call higgledy-piggledy, but he does not make any money. He sits on his grand ideas like a cou- veuse, just like an old hen; but will he hatch something? sais pas; but I know he does not hatch any money.

Madame Steignitz struck a match and, lighting her lamp, motioned Luther to a seat on an old lounge covered with faded chintz. Rapidly throwing off her bonnet, cloak, and  I 6o        NEVER AGAIN. cat-skin victorine, and opening the folds of a dingy curtain covering a shallow recess, she hung them or rather flung they with a careless jerk on to their accustomed pegs at the foot of a narrow bed. The gloves, however, demanded more con. sideration. She advanced to the light, examined the stains and rents, shook her head sorrowfully, and slowly drawing them off, smoothed them out with care, and placed them with great deliberation and precision in a handsome glove-box of Russia leather. In doing this, she disclosed a pair of very white and delicate hands, well-shaped and smooth, and giving none of the usual and certain signs of age in the roughened skin and the predominance of the flexor over the extensor muscles.              , Luther looked on much amused.  He thought he compre- hended the whole scene, and his imagination framed upon the instant a long story. Once a lady, young, handsome, and vain; once the envy of women and the admiration of men: for it was plain to be seen in her vivacious dark eye, her straight and well-formed nose, a little inclining, perhaps, to the Jewish type, in her large, full-lipped, but expressive mouth, her nicely- rounded chin, in fact in the general contour of head and face, that, in those days, far back, when vigorous pulses had dis- tended and illuminated the now dried and darkened skin, she had been handsome. Disappointment in love-loss of friends -and then poverty, stern poverty, driving out vanity; chas- ing it from head and cheek and person; leaving nothing but a remnant clinging to the handsome hands in their special priv ilege of the finest and nicest Parisian dress--that was the story! Luther was right in the main as to the indications of hand and glove, but wrong in his conjecture as to the- moving pas- sion. It was not blighted affection, hardly grief, and certainly not poverty that had so nearly exterminated the universal, and almost strongest, sentiment of the female heart. It was a stronger, fiercer influence: the inordinate love of money-a passion within bounds useful;, but, uncontrolled, like Aaron's rod; or, to drop such a hackneyed figure, like a badly-trained A  -         ...-p. .--    NE VER A GA IN.        I6x ferret in a barn-yard, killing the rats and driving off all vermin, but, in its insatiable blood-thirsty rage, throttling and destroy- ing, right and left, young and old, the defenceless denizens of the poultry-ground and the hen-house. "Maintenant!" exclaimed Madame Steignitz, turning 'round to Luther, "let me look at you. I want to see the young gentleman who would give his arm to help a poor old woman in Broadway. Bon!" she continued, as Luther smiled under this deliberate scrutiny. "Now you shall tell me all about yourself," and the old lady began a string of questior-s as to age, birth, parentage, present employment, and future prospects, etc., to which Luther replied very amiably until at last he began to be a little annoyed by her minute inquisitive- ness. She probed him, however, with so much pertinacity and vivacity of manner that he could not escape answering. He told about his steam-boat disaster; described his friends Captain Combings and Mr. Whoppers; and touched upon the social and epicurean delights of Miss Jones' boarding- house. But one thing he avoided, and that was the title of the firm in whose employment he was, from a feeling that the mention of Mr. Ledgeral's name might lead to some inquiries about the family in Waverley Place, which he might not like to answer. Happily she did not demand the name. The com- mon New York phrase, ' in a store down town,' satisfied her, and prevented the necessity of mentioning a name that might have aroused associations she little thought of at the moment. Luther of course knew nothing of this. His hesitation was an instinctive, not a conscious, shrinking. It was an invol- untary pause, as the hollow murmur of Mr. Whoppers' silver sea upon whose shore he stood surged up in gusts of profound- est warning. The old lady took another look at Luther's face. "Bon!" she exclaimed ; " ce n'est pas le regard d'un friion. You have told me about yourself; I will tell you about myself. My first name was De Laune-Annette De Laune, but I married a German, Steignitz. Ha!" exclaimed the old lady, turning sharply to Luther and eying him suspiciously, " you did not   i62        NEVER AGAIN. know that was my name when you helped me up in the street; you never heard of Madame Steignitz-eh?" Luther shook his head. "Well, well, that is my name. I am a poor woman-very poor, and I have no relatives, no friends; but I do not need any help. I do not beg. I live by myself. It does not cost much. Nobody comes to see me. AIy husband left me this house. 'Tis old; 'tis broken; my tenants cheat me of the rent; the city robs me with the tax; and then the interest upon mortgage in this country is so high. Ah mon Dieu! A poor woman in this country has a hard time to faire son chemin-what you call to get along." "Have you no wish to return to your own country?" demanded Luther. "No, no, 1 have no country. When I was young I love my own country; I love my other country-hinter dem Rhin. And now, this is my country. I shall have no other. But do not go," she continued, as Luther made a motion to depart; "you are the first that has been in this chamber for several years. I like your .looks; I think you are honest; I know you are brave. Yes! yes! yes!"  She nodded her head emphatically several times, and suddenly her eyes, which were steadily directed at Luther's face, seemed to penetrate com- pletely through him and beyond him into blank space, thou- sands of miles away. She started, raised her hands, and flung them out with a movement of desperate impatience and rage; the next instant clasped and wrung them with an expression of. the fiercest anguish. "Ah, mon Dieu, mon Dieu," she cried, "if he had lived he too might have been like this. Oui, oui, like this. O, mon enfant, mon petit! Pardon," she exclaimed in the next motnent, laying her hand gently on Luther's arm. "I have frightened you, but it is nothing. You will forgive a poor old woman who has sometimes some ugly thoughts. She is not crazy. Do you not have any fears! It is all right here," tap- ping her forehead. "And now I want you to come and see me sometimes. It seems to me that some light comes where m   VNEVER AGAIN.          63 you stand, and it, is so very dark! yes, it is so very dark always. I want you should come sometimes." Luther expressed his willingness to do so. "Ah, yes, I know what that means. You hope to have the pleasure sometime; but I must have something better than that. I have never asked anybody to come and see me before. Why should anybody come to see a poor old French- woman? To do so they must have some cause, some reason. I am not such a fool as to think they would come for nothing. To make sure, I must bribe you. I cannot give you money. I have none, and if I had," she added apologetically, seeing Luther's face beginning to flush--" if I had, you would not take it? Well, 'tis not many such; but I must bribe, you. You would come once or twice to please a poor, solitary old woman; but no, I will not that old age should be exigeant to youth. You shall not come once or twice, but fifty times, to please yourself. You tell-me you study a great deal. You say you have studied the French a little, but you cannot speak it. Would you like to speak French?" Luther's eyes sparkled. "Nothing I desire so much," he replied. "Nothing am I so determined upon, but my oppor- tunities are poor. I cannot afford a private master, and twice a week with a large public class at the Mercantile Library is slow work." "C'est Sa," exclaimed Madame Steignitz, "the lessons are few, the time is short, the practice is nothing, and not always the master is good. You come to, me, I remedy all that. I make you speak French; I know how to teach better than a master; I have learned them myself. I speak German like my own language. I speak English, as you see. I speak Ital- -ian as well as the Pope; and I have lived three years in Ma- drid. You shall come to me it shall cost you nothing. In six months I will make you speak French, not like a native Parisian-that is all blague, what you call 'stuff'-but you shall speak it like a gentleman comme ilfaut, and not like a school- boy. The Frenchman shall not say, Voila un Parisien! mais on dira, 1/ arle mieux qu'un Franpais. Un petit accent  L   "        NEVER AGAIN. Mais comme, cest delicieux! And, perhaps, German, too! Ah!  but that would be trop de bonheur, eh? No, no, it shall be." Madame Steignitz laughed and held out her hand, and Lu. ther took his leave with feelings quite elated as the vision of unlimited French opened before him. k   CHAPTER IX.  Tihe Inventor-New .York Streets-Hygienic PropositionS-Planly's Plans-Whoppers on Luther's Good Luck-An Invitation to the House up-town-The Editor's Comments-Certain Characters and Characteristics of Society, S Luther came out into the hall the door of the front attic room was opened, and Mr. Planly, the inventor, made his appearance and prepared to descend the stairs. He was tall, gaunt, and round-shouldered. A short, thin, faded blue camlet cloak hung from his shoulders, and partially concealed a seamed, smirched, and almost thread-bare suit of black, which was carefully buttoned up to the chin, perhaps solely to protect his breast from the cold, but, as no linen appeared above the rusty black silk cravat, perhaps, also, to screen a well-worn woollen shirt from sight. Perhaps! we say, for there was a depth of speculation in-those dark gray, caverned eyes that forbade a measurement of motives by the little two- foot rule of social vanities and sentiments. A thick grizzly beard and mustache partially concealed the sunken cheeks and delicate mouth, and the well-rounded, but not very powerful jaw and chin. The nose, well enough in its way, was not a prominent feature; not at all a powerful nose; but above it, the forehead swelled into proportions truly striking. Thy immense breadth rather obscured the length. The per- ceptive and reflective organs-seemed to be well balanced, but the organs of ideality, bursting out in great tables and plains of osseous development on either side, made and marked the character of the head. They suggested to Luther's mind the idea of being levered upward and outward by the same irre- sistible power that is upheaving the shores of Sweden, or the plateaus and mountain masses of Colorado and Nevada.   "        NE VER A GA IN. "Exactly," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, to whom Luther was relating his adventures. "Undoubtedly the same power; correlation of forces, you know, and all that. Now couldn't we devise some experiments to determine the exact propor- tion, say between the Catskills and that fellow's cerebellum?" Mr. Planly took off his battered and napless hat in return to Luther's respectful salutation. A few scanty gray hairs covered the top of his head, which was quite-flat, as if the organ of veneration had been cut off or driven in, leaving in fact a hollow that would almost have held water like the back of a prize ox. The mechanical inventor stood revealed. What could a man with such a shaped head do but worship the graven images, the cut and carvd and hammered idols of his own fancy, and revel in the glorious mechanical possibilities of material nature. Not for him the reverential awe of authority, not for him an unhesitat- ing faith it dogma, not for him the meritorious abasement of self before the unknown and the unknowable. The dance of his imagination must be along the paths, or rather by-paths, of the practicka and the actual ; his faith must necessarily be circumscribed and hampered by obedience to scientific methods and conclusions, and his soul, unlike many happier souls, inhabiting heads with an elevated apex, could not be upborne into the regions of religious mist upon the pious pin- ions of a devout metaphysic, but must necessarily wing its flights, guided by the dictates of a positive philosophy, along the less elevated, but still gorgeous and wonderful, hills and valleys, meads and gardens, of a material and objective creation. : Mr. Planly returned Luther's salute, and together they descended the stairs. Both seemed struck with each other's appearance, and with reason, for there was much in both that would have attracted the eye of even a common observer. Of course, the conversation began with the inevitable subject -the range of the thermometer, and that New York topic par excellence-the state of the streets. Happy, happy denizen of the great Western metropolis! N   NEVER AGAIN.           I67 Oow thankful ought he to be for the crowning mercy of American life! How grateful to a benign municipal govern- nent ought he ever to be for a topic of conversation not ackneyed like the weather, but always fresh and always present! How proud ought he to be of his citizenship! I am aRoman citizen 1 Bah! I am a citizen of New .York! a :itizen of a city of patient people! Talk not of Rome, or the rampant virtues of that vehement pagan race. Under similar circumstances of dust, mud, filth, rascality; and corruption, they would have risen in revolution, cut off the heads of theirs consuls, tried their tribunes and hanged them, and flogged their lictors with their own fasces! The Christian virtues, patience, humility, meekness; the meritorious conditions of' submission, long-suffering, and endurance of evil could never, then and there, have received that special and wonderful illustration which constitutes the real greatness and glory of New York. Mr. Planly expressed' the opinion that, offensive as may be the dirt of the streets, both to eye and nose, the danger to health is small compared with that from the great laboratory of malific influences underlying the streets. "It is unquestionably the sewers," he said, "that are the great breeders and feeders, of disease; and there is no excuse for that, you know, so long as the trouble can be so easily remedied." "By the utilization of the sewerage and its conversion into fertilizing products?" demanded Luther. "No," replied Mr. Planly. "It will take, perhaps, a hun- dred years before New Yorkers get that amount of sanitary science knocked into them. Three generations at least must struggle along with poisonous gases, and the miasms of scarlet fever, cholera, and typhoid ; and hundreds of thousands of children, and adults as well, will have to be slaughtered before the people can rise to a sufficiently clear conception that the present disposal of sewerage is wicked and wasteful, as well as offensive, or be willing to submit to the great labor and expense of a complete change of system. No, my cnly   I 0AS; VERz'i A GAIN. hope for the present generation is in a much simpler plan-. one that has been tried and found to work admirably." "Where was that?" demanded Luther. "In Killoam," replied Mr. Planly; and seeing Luther look a little blank he added, "the great capital of Frama. zugda--you will find an account of it in thlat veracious book of travels-Kaloolah. The plan consistsi building towers or ventilating chimneys to the sewers. Here in New York," con- tinued Mr. Planly, "I suppose that from thirty to forty such towers-say two hundred feet high-would be enough, They would not cost much, especially when we consider the vast evil to be remedied, and that no system of plumbing that could be devised can, or if devised, will, from its expense and inconvenienceO, and the recklessness of individuals, make of our houses anything but poisonous death-dealing centres of disease. If expense is an objection, better build them in the roughest way, without ornamentation, like the draft chimneys of manufactories. Health first and beauty afterwards-a million of dollars would build the whole forty in a plain but effective style. Arrangements should be made for increasing the draft .at will by burning gas within the chimney, and perhaps a design -might be adopted for dseod- orizing and purifying or destroying the effluvium in its pas- sage upward. But perhaps it would be well not to compli- cate. the plan beyond the conceptive powers of the average municipal mind." "It seems as if it might be effective," said Luther. "Seems! my dear Sir!" exclaimed Mr. Planly, catching Luther's arm and pulling him around the corner out of the" way of the wind, which began to whistle keenly. "Seems! why it has been done. Livingstone, I hope, will be able to tell us all about it when he gets home, for he must have visited Killoam.  It can't fail. The elements of the calculation are all known-and I have gone overthem myself. In the first place, the awful evil to be overcome is admitted--next, the area of sewerage, amount of poison to be eliminated, area of ventilat- ing shafts-height of shaft, strength of up-draft, consequent   NE VE R A GA IN.        I69 pressure outward and downward at all the orifices in our houses, where now the poisonous pressure is inward and up- ward, are all calculable." Mr. Planly had found a sympathetic listener, and his voice grew emphatic as the enthusaism of the inventor rose. He could have talked, for an hour on the peak of an iceberg. Never mind the cold wind or a cold dinner. Luther began to think of the last, when a happy thought struck him-not that it required any great stretch of imagina- tion. It was simply, one that is almost inconceivably natural and common to the New York mind. He thought that he would dive into a neighboring oyster-cellar and have a stew, and the suspicion crossed his mind that perhaps, if he asked Mr. Planly to join him, it might be an unusually proper and appro- priate thing to do. At any rate a double box-stew of splen- did East Rivers, unlimited coolslaa, and bread and butter, and a glass of creamy ale, did not appear in the least to inter- fere with the inventor's willingness to unfold a little more in detail his ideas of sanitary reform. Luther listened with interest. The idea of extirpating at one swoop and at so little expense, and without interfering with any of the settled habits or prejudices of the community, so large a proportion of the causes of disease and consequent misery would have charms for a less enthusiastic and imagina- tive mind. Just to think of what could be done, and that almost immediately. Think of the thousands of lives that would be preserved. Think of the pains, the aches, the ailings, the blood-poisonings, the fevers and zymotic diseases of all kinds that would be prevented. Think of the doctor's bills that would be saved. Think of the almost universal blasphemy in attributing to the Divine Being the results of men's culpable ignorance and carelessness that would be forever suppressed! Why, the gain would be something tremendous in all its social consequences! -"The world does move," said Mr. Planly, as he blandly accepted Luther's offer of a second glass of ale, "but oh, how slowly in the matter of social and sanitary reform. In a cen-   170        NE VER AGA IN. tury or two, people will look back to our times with somewhat of the same feelings with which we regard the old gare de reau system of Edinburgh and various Continental cities. They will wonder how we could have endured for a moment the thousand ills and miseries which will then no longer exist, but which we now absurdly suppose flesh to be necessarily heir to, and- which we blindly dignify into visitations of God." "You wouldn't expect to abolish all diseases?" demanded Luther. "1Oh no! only a large proportion of the most terrible. There would still remain diseases enough to do de'ath's work, without keeping the old fellow waiting for old age. But I must say that I think it hardly possible to calculate how far or how wide a reform in this one thing might extend. Do you know," and here Mr.- Planly, as his second mug of ale began to acquire a gentle inclination from the perpendicular, grew more and more confidential, " do you know that I believe that a great deal of the universal craving for stimulants of some kind is due to the depressing effect of miasmatic effluvia. Think of that! If that is so, eh?" "I see," said Luther. "It is admitted that there is not much use in attacking King Alcohol in front. You would turn his flank, and take him in the rear, and scatter his chief allies." "Exactly." And Mr. Planly emphasized the expression by draining the last drop. The conversation rambled on for some little time. Mr. Planly explained his plan for improved ventilation of houses, and controlling the temperature-and especially for the pro- duction of cold. Every attention has been paid to heating houses, none to cooling-in our climate, almost as great a necessity as the other. Mr. Planly pulled out his pencil and rapidly illustrated the system of cooling on a grand scale by means of condensed air, led into the houses in tubes, so that any one could turn a stop-cock and flash as much cold air into his rooms as he pleased. Mr. Planly would have continued   A NE VER A GA IN.       171  the conversation indefinitely, but Luther,. although very much interested, bethought himself of his studies, and finding that it was eight o'clock, made a movement from the table, from which the last cracker and the last shred of cold-cut cabbage had disappeared. Both of them expressing their obligations each to the other for an interesting hour, they parted with mutual promises of further and more intimate acquaintance. At the corner of Broadway Luther bade Mr. Planly good- evening, and hurried around the block to his home in Bleecker Street. He was late, but Miss Jones received him with -a gracious smile, and a weak and cold cup of tea was the only penalty. No, not the only penalty, he was doomed to listen to a long discussion between Dr. Dronly and Mrs. Lasher as to whether Spiritualism was a voice from the angelic spheres, or whether it was simply a manifestation of the devil. Both agreed as to the facts. The thumps, jumps, kicks, table-dancing, spirit-faces, and floatings about, generally in darkened rooms, there could be no dispute about--but the explanation! Ah! then came a harmonic divergence--an agreement to disagree. Both repudiated as utterly absurd the psychic or odic force theory ; but, while"Mrs. Lasher maintained that the wonderful phenomena were manifestations of departed spirits, the Doctor placed himself, as he said, squarely and firmly upon the-bibli- cal record, and maintained that they were nothing more nor less than the doings of Satan himselfi ' So you have been doing the gallant this evening," ex- claimed Mr. Whoppers. "Walking Broadway in the daytime with a widow on your arm! Look out for. the widows, Luther; oh, you need not look so astonished. Rolf says that he met you with Madame Steignitz hanging on to you as lovingly as if she was your own grandmother. How did you pick her up? ' "Pick her up? well, that is just it; she slipped daown in the street and I picked her up. But how did Rolf know that her name was Madame Steignitz; and who is Madame Steig- - -.   172        NEVER A GA IN. nitz? No disreputable character, I hope," said Luther, who began to think that perhaps he had made a mistake in making her acquaintance. "Well, Rolf knows her name because he is in the Bank and he has frequenDtly to look after her dividends. Nobody knows much about her, but there is no doubt that she is rich. Rolf says she owns rows of houses, has piles of bonds and mortgages, and oceans of bank-stock : manages it all herself, never spends or gives away a penny. But female misers are always freaky. They haven't the cold-blooded persistence of the male beast. Who knows but that you have made a lucky find, in finding the old woman ; you may find your name in her will some day." "Pshaw! Rolf is wrong. The old woman that I was help- ing is a poor old woman, miserably poor, but I think that I was lucky in falling in with her." And then Luther told Whoppers of Madame Steignitz's promise of daily lessons in French." "Whew!" -exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, "you green ones- you modest chaps, have a way of going it sometimes that leaves us old fellows far in the rear. Just look at it! You saunter up Broadway, caring for nothing or nobody, and this old Crassus or Croesus in petticoats tumbles into your arms. Pick her up! why I'd pick up a dozen of the ugliest old wealthy women in town; pads, panniers, paint, bought teeth, store-hair and all, for half of your chance."'  Luther laughed and protested that he had no designs upon the old lady's purse, but that he meant to pick her brains of a little German and French. "When do you begin?" demanded Mr. Whoppers. "To-morrow evening I am to take my first lesson at eight o'clock." "No, you can't do that," replied Mr. Whoppers; "you have made another engagement, or rather I have for you. I was up at the house in Waverley Place to-day, and it was intimated to me that my presence would be required to-morrow evening at a small party. As I don't figure on the light fantastic, i 1 -r  Y asr   NEVER AGAIN.          173 except in the old-fashioned quadratics or the Virginia reel, I suppose I am asked to corner some old dowager and keep her quiet while her charge has the range of the rooms." "But what has that to do with me?" demanded Luther. "Why you are invited too. I was told to ask you. It is an impromptu affair; small and informal; quite a, family party; 'no cards,' as they say in the wedding notices nowa- days; swallow-tails of course, dress vest, pantaloons, and white neckties advisable, but rien -de rigzeur except light kids. Old Ledgeral told me to bring you up." "Well, I won't go," replied Luther. "Why not?" demanded   lnr. Whoppers; "you are not a-going to cut up proud, are you? Do you want papa to call upon you in a coach-and-four, and mamma to send Brown to you with her respectful compliments, in a monogrammed enve- lope a foot square? Npow I know that my invitation comes from my Lord, and that my Lady just barely assents, but what do I care? There is always a choice of Green Seal or Roe- derer, and as to the chicken salad, old Joseph makes it him- self. You think you have been neglected because you have been now more than a year in the store, and haven't as yet been invited up-town to dinner half-a-dozen times. Don't make a fool of yourself! What would you think of a fellow who should refuse to take a stroll in the Hesperides, or even to look into the garden gates, because the golden apples hang above reach, and old Cerberus won't allow a ladder? I have half a mind not to tell you something." "Well, keep it to yourself then," replied Luther; "but don't mistake me or think me such a fool as to expect or desire any attentions that my position don't warrant. I know what I am, a poor devil of a clerk ; but I am better off than I was two years ago--I .have advanced a step or two, and you know ce n'est que Hepremier pas qui cotie. I've had my salary raised, and that hundred dollars you gave me for my scrib- blings I've stored away in the Savings Bank. I've got my foot upon the shore of that silver sea, or that golden gulf, you are eternally talking about. I don't care which it is. If it's a ,   174        /VE /-ER AGAIN. silver sea, I am going to build a boat of bank-notes and sail over it; if it's a golden gulf, I'll be hanged if I don't bridge it or jump it; but, until I do, you musn't suppose I am going to wriggle myself into the attentions of society, or to feel hurt because I don't receive them. If your friend, the great sexton of Grace Church, should offer to put me upon his list of salta- tory availables to-morrow, I should refuse; but I don't think it is pride." "Well, what do you call it then?" "I call it self-respect." "Bah! how does self-respect prevent your going with me to-morrow night?" "In this way: a verbal invitation, through you from the  master of the house, does not indicate in any way the slightest desire for my^presence on the part of the only persons whose wishes I care to consult." "Now   I'll be hanged'!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, "if I havn't half a mind not to tell you." "Tell me what?" "Why that Miss Helen followed me into the hall, and said, 'Tell Mr. Lansdale that Aunt Shippen sends him a special invitation, and that we shall all be happy to see him; there's going to be very few of sister's set here: only a dozen of my friends and some old folks. Tell him he must come.' }Now you are not going to refuse such an invitation as that, are you? If you do, all I can say is that you're a confounded impracticable prig." "Well that alters the case," replied Luther, "but I am afraid I shall not cut much of a figure; you know I am entirely green yet." "That is just the point; don't try to cut any figure at all, and you will do well enough. If we had time, I'd iake Ham- ilton Boggs give you some lessons. Boggs is under obligations to me. I've attacked him more than a  dozen times in the Universe. I've called him a  contemptible sprig of fashion three times. Three times I have informed him personally that high- birth and breeding furnish no excuse for brutal and    NEA:VER AGAIN.         175 overbearing manners to common people; and three times, lately, I have denounced him as a bloated aristocrat. In return he has given me a good deal of fashionable news; and two dinners at Delmonico's; but he hasn't half paid me. If we had time, I know he would give you any instructions. I don't mean in the way of manners. You are all right there; but a little -information as to the lay of the land,and who's who, and all that. No matter, however, I can tell you all that is necessary. I can show you all the styles. The verdant and the slightly sentimental will do in this case. You can grin and say nothing at all, if you choose, or you can bow and say, 'I hope I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Thompson well this evening-but, I need not ask,' and then grin as if you were going to kadd, 'she is looking so charming.' But that kind of thing won't do in some cases. You might get a put- back as Jules Rodgers did when he made the same speech to Tilly Dusenbury: 'Bright as a button and real solid silver, I declare ; but I must tell you, confidentially, that I can't accept it, for ever since the income tax papa won't let us use anything but electro-plate.' "Boggs tells about her dancing with the Prince. Tilly belongs to the Pushton set, and so she was, to dance with the Prince, and the best birth, breeding and refinement of society had to stand back and kotoe from a decent distance. After the dance the Hon. Mr. Flickerson came up to her with his 'IAw, aw, Miss Dusenbury, how do you find his Royal High- ness as a partner? ' 'Jolly; a perfect pet ; a real broth of a boy; especially after I had given him a little instruction.' ' Aw, aw, how extraordinary.' ' Yes, I told his Royal High- ness to waist me up a little higher, shorten his grip, and lengthen his stride; which he did, and away we went like birds.' ' God bless me! how very extraordinary!' and the Elon. Mr. Flickerson had to seize a glass of champagne to keep from fainting away on the spot. However, to-mor- row you won't have to do with any of the real fast ones- tnostly young fillies, quiet and untrained. You can seldom or never get a two-forty gait out of a girl under twenty-five.  176        NEVER AGAIN. There are, it is true, some rare exceptions. There is Minnie Yadkins, for instance. She began to show both speed and bottom at eighteen." "And what is her rate now," laughingly demanded Luther.          . "Well, I have not had lately an opportunity to time her, but 1 rather guess she can't be beat. She's about as fast as they make 'em nowadays. She don't care what she says or does, or how she says and does it, and in the matter of chaff she can beat a steam threshing-machine any day. I'll tell you what, you had-not better give her any of your sass.' She'd deluge you with the latest and most fashionable slang. The last time I was standing beside her at a party, young Davy Spoons, just out, came up to her, simpering and bow- ing, and said, 'May I have the felicity of complimenting Miss Yadkins upon her exquisite toilet this evening, and of hoping that she will honor me with a turn or two?' 'Well, bully for you, little David,' she exclaimed, with a laugh, and tapping him with her fan, 'I don't know but you may sling me round I a few times. But stop, let me see,' she said looking at her tablets, 'ah! yes, I have promised the next heat to Waltie Von Twill; but I guess I'll let him slide.' 'Oh, I don't wish to interfere with anybody,' began Spoons. 'Oh, bother! never mind,' she interrupted, 'Waltie will keep, especially if you put a little ice upon him once in a while.' And all this with a certain grace of manner and tone that takes it quite out of the plane of low-life vulgarity, and elevates it into the highest regions of social inanity and indecency." "Do you mean to tell me," exclaimed Luther, his face ablaze with indignation, "that the highest class of society is composed of such as your Miss Yadkinses and Miss Dusen- burys?" "Dame, as the French say, I don't know that the Misses Yadkins abound, but they exist, and the tendency is to make more of them. Demand and supply, you know. When you wanted a two-forty horse you got him; and now there are five hundred of them right here in New York, and a dozen or two   NE ER AGAIN.          1 " that can turn a mile in two-twenty. However, you won't meet any of the flyers to-morrow night; or if you should you won't see anything very fast; the aura of the Ledgeral set is not favorable to any marked exhibitions of speed. Besides, you are too green yet to readily distinguish pace and action, even if you should meet 'em. But you'll go to-morrow night?" "Perhaps." Luther was glad to be alone. He had enough of Mr. Whoppers' conversation for the time. He did not always like its tone, and this evening it was particularly jarring and discordant. He had no great confidence in Mr. Whoppers' knowledge of the highest phases of society, and he didn't really believe a word about fast girls and coarse snobs, and ill-bred, ignorant, dowdy fashionables, and all that cant and slang of the envious, ignoble vulgar. He felt quite confident that the highest fashion embraced nothing but the highest culture, the utmost refinement of mind and heart, the perfec- tion of manners, the last ultimate attainments of grace, beauty, amiability, and wit. If it didn't, what was the use of having any distinctions in society at all? Isn't "society",- that is, society that pretends to be " society " par excellence- founded as much upon the concessions of the many as upon the assumptions of the few: and are people such downright donkeys as to stand a tyranny that is nothing if not noble? Impossible! Isn't it well known- that the sole motive, the only justification, the veritable raison d'tre of an exclusive fashionable set, is the cultivation of a certain quiet elegance of manner-a certain grace of conversation-a certain refine- ment of mind and heart? And all this not so much for its own pleasure and improvement as for an example and a counterpoise to the boorishness of common people, and as the guardian of the sacred traditions of culture and of all *mental and moral sweetness? Bah! he wouldn't believe a word of Whoppers' talk; but he resolved to learn the true state of the case some day from his own observation. Under the guidance of Mr. Whoppers he had attended 12   two or three public balls, and had made one of a small party at the house of a distinguished public functionary and poli- :ician in Madison Avenue. At this last there were splendid apartments filled with the most costly furniture, and decora- ted in the style of the newest splendor. And why not? Did it not all come out of the public pockets of one of the richest cities in the world? There was any amount of dress, jewels, and good looks ; the music was exquisite; the cham- pagne veritable the pdtc) de foie and terrapin unquestion. able; the spun sugar magnificent. The centre piece was art elaborate representation of the new City Hall; and all around the border of the table was a most delicately curved and interlaced chain of horse-railroads, street-sewers, and grand half-graded boulevards. It was all beautiful, artistic splendid, but there was a yahooistic touch and tone with it all that went right to Luther's heart. He felt that he was not even at the portals of genuine, elevated, cultivated fash- ion. His instinctive refinement was so shocked that he point- blank refused to go with Mr. Whoppers to a similar enter- tainmeilt where it was expected there would be several Con- gressmen and their families; two or three of the Chiefs of Tammahy; one of the most distinguished members of the Board of Supervisors, who had made an immense fortune; and a contractor for odd Corporation jobs, worth his five millions; with any quantity of Aldermanic millionaires. "Well, I must admit," said Mr. Whoppers, who was urg- i  ng Luther to go, "it is not exactly the creme de la cr'me, but let me tell you, that is a fluid not quite so easy in all cases to get."  "Well, if I can't get cream," returned Luther, "that is no reason why I should drink swill milk, is it? No, I'll wait." "Well, you may have to wait until the cows come honme." I  will; and i'll be in no hurry for the first milking either. I'll wait for the strippings." Luther felt a pang of regret at having to break his first engagement with Madame Steignitz; but how could he refuse   1Vz van GAG-SrV.      I79    i&  an invitation from Miss Helen Ledgeral? True, her-image had somewhat paled in the past two years, during which he had only seen her at church and half-a-dozen times in the street, and generally then only to bow to her. In fact it might have faded away like a morning cloud in the full glare of day into the dimmest and remotest regions of fancy had it not been for Mr. Whoppers. He very innocently acted as a go-between, and by his occasional remarks and his frequent items of up-town news kept up the interest. Like a busy humble-bee buzzing from flower to flower in a clover-field, and ignorant of the important part he is playing in the fructifi- cation of the plant; so the editor fluttered back and forth, utterly unaware of the little germs of passion he was carrying. With Helen the feeling of profound interest in the young man had grown rather than decreased-and she was perfectly ready to avow it. Why shouldn't she? What more natural? Wasn't he her protege-didn't she make him what he is? Wasn't he, as almost head: clerk, and a rapidly rising young man, purely her own creation? And how nicely he had repaid her! how fully he had justified her recommendation! Why, even her father had mentioned him more than once with commen- dation, and Uncle Shippen had said that he believed that he was a great deal better than most young men. Luther, of course, couldn't know all this. He had thought of himself as quite forgotten, and he had begun to think of her as one that must soon inevitably vanish from his vision, and to wonder whether, when he too had crossed the silver sea or jumped the golden gulf, he should find anything half as fair on the other side. But now-well he should see her; speak to her perhaps; dance with her perhaps; hold her delicate hand in his perhaps ; and-that is, if mamma allowed round dances-clasp her flexile waist; cushion her head on his shoulder; feel her soft breath on his cheek ; and reel, whirl, fly away up into the most distant nebulous regions of the surrounding heaven. He hastily scribbled a note of ex- cuse to Madame Steignitz to be delivered in the morning, and jumped into his knobby corn-husk bed.   CHAPTER X.

THERE    are going to be more people than I thought," said Mr. Whoppers, as he and Luther ascended the marble steps in Washington Square, and heard the announcement "Gentlemen, second floor front." "Well, that is all the better for you; you won't feel quite so much as if everybody was looking at you. Ah! Joseph, how do you do?  I've got a bone to pick with you."  '* "A bone, sar!" grinned Joseph. "Yes, a big one: why did you tell me that there was to be no party to-night-half-a-dozen people or so?" "Well, sah, I tell de truf; 'taint no party, only a little gatherem ; most 'specially ob de young folks purty much all in de firm or de family. You don't see no Mister Brown out- side de door, do you?  I've got de supumversion ob de whole ting myself." "You're right Joseph," laughecdr. Whoppers, as he and Luther ascended to the dressing room. "No Brown; no party.  You ought to know Brown. He's a New York insti- tution of the biggest kind. I don't know, for a certainty, but I don't believe they have got such a thing in all London or Paris. They may have Joneses and Fergusons and Jenkins. es ; they may'even have Browns, but I don't-believe they have got a Brown.  Our Brown is the embodiment of an immense amount of social force. He  is a power; an authority; a   NEVER A GAIN.         8I law; all imposing and ponderous expression of fashion. He has no:irivals. There are other men who can be hired to dis- tribute cards; superintend the arrivals; call and direct coach- men; and all that kind of thing; but it is well known tot all your-acquaintances that you employ them only because you can't get Brown. Your ball or party minus Brown only signi- fies that the ultra fashionable Mrs. De Bellevert, or Mrs. Van Twiller, is giving a ball or party at the same time. You must know Brown. He's a friend of mine; I'll introduce you' some time. Come, hurry on your kids, and let us go down: you feel a little shy? well, of course you do, I wouldn't give two cents for a young fellow in your circumstances who didn't." "Well, I'd give a good deal more than-two cents for a little of your modest assurance," said Luther. "Bah! never you fear. It's just like public speaking; the man who don't hesitate and boggle and break down the first time he tries speaki}g in public will never make an orator; so the young martlx',r woman either, who is not a little shy at first going into company will never have good manners. An absence of shyness indicates an absence of imagination and sensibility, without which manner may be passable, but sel- dom downright pleasing, much less perfect. I was shy myself once, but I have almost forgotten the time when; so, courage! follow me, and where you see my white plume wave, dash into the heady current of the fight-into the thick of the melee; where bright eyes are flashing and sweet voices ring- ing; and frizzetts and chignons bowing and bending; and fair bosomns heaving; and all the batteries of beauty playing; and champagne flowing like water; and chicken-salad and oysters hurtling around in the most deadly volleys; and if you don't find me bearing myself bravely, then never be your oriflatnme again the helmet of Navarre, nevar! nevar! ' Oh no, we nevar mention her!" Mr. Whoppers chuckled heart- ily as he descended the stairs. "I would give a dollar," he exclaimed to Luther, " to have had old Ledgeral hear that. He squirms at a pun, or a quotation, or a quibble of any kind   I82      N. VEVER AGAIN. as if you'd stuck a pin in him. However, I'll contrive to give him a prick or two before I get through; I'll pay him off for his condescension in asking me to-night." Joseph threw open the door as they crossed the hall, and announced their names in a loud and distinct tone, and the next moment Luther stood bowing and blushing before the ladies of the house. The stereotyped smile of Mrs. Ledgeral expanded into an expression of mingled surprise and pleasure as her eyes fell upon Luther's glowing face. She graciously extended her hand; murmured a few words of welcome ; and Luther felt, himself wafted onward by a gentle impulse into the room. He drew himself up by one of the pilasters of the folding- door and looked around. There were not more than two or three dozen of people in the room, but there were more coming in, and to Luther's apprehension there was to be quite a crowd. Not that it made any difference to him how many there were, but everybody, so far, seemnydtk oknow everybody, while he knew nobody, and the senseofial nonentity is so much enhanced in a large assembly. Besides, if there were to be so many people, he might miss the only object he had in coming. Where was she? what had become of her? There was Miss Ledgeral, who had not even condescended to, look at him when he entered the room. He knew her from the resemblance, and, besides, he had seen her several times in the street, but- "Mr. Lansdale has not forgotten me, I hope," said a low, softly-modulated voice at his side. Luther turned. Great heavens, what a vision met his eyes! A full-grown and in every way quite a perfect young woman! Lithe,l but not lathy; somewhat on the willow pat- tern, as becomes a very young woman; but with a waist as unlike that of a wasp as is-the waist of Venus -herself; no com- pression preventing all activity of digestion and nutrition, and hampering the movements of lungs and heart; no paintings or pencillings or dyeings or powderings or paddings ; no artificial cotton-wool developments; no-well there is no necessity of   NE VER AGAAIN.          183 enumerating all that there was not; inasmuch as Luther's knowledge on such subjects was limited, and no young man is supposed to be able to understand means and appliances; he can only recognize results. He saw the smooth, elastic, well- nourished skin, and caught the under-flash of the deep but delicate flesh-tints that painters find it so hard to reproduce. No thin, shiny, pink-and-white cuticular prettinesses; but the delicate bloom of a Marguerite, toned by the deep tints that on Raphael's brush touched the cheeks and bosom of the For- narina. He saw the red, ripe lips, slightly parted, and throwing their roseate shadows upon two gleaming rows of Hygeia's white-coated guards--those best indices of asound constitu- tion and a good digestion-that no dentist's hand would have dared, in their perfectness, to imitate. He saw and looked away down into the large liquid lustrous gray eyes that seemed almost black in the deep shadows of their long lashes,-eyes full of an expression half melancholy, half joyous ; an intoxica- 6 ting mixture of tenderness and archness,--eyes that seemed to open and envelop the person they fell upon with a misty and perfumed mantle of love and mirth,--eyes like portals to some beautiful palace with a thousand little devils, serious and nny, pathetic and comic, struggling with each other for lgress,-not at all ox eyes, or gazelle eyes, or any other kind of animal's eyes. They were eyes that without any further ungainly straining after similes can best be described by noting one of their effects: there was not an old, bald-headed, gray-bearded sinner in society who did not silently thank God very time they fell upon him. ",You have not quite forgotten me?" she said, extending her hand. "Oh, no!" exclaimed Luther, as he shyly touched the tips f her little fingers. "How could I? that is, I hope, that- that you could not think it possible,-but," he added, recover- ing by a mighty effort from his embarrassment, " if I had, I don't know that I should have been wholly to blame. It has been so very long since I have seen you, and you have changed so much."  o"For the better, I hope," she answered, with a little bend of the head and an arch sparkle of the eye, " but you need not reply, I know the formula ; I hear it often enough, and- I am not fishing for a compliment." "No, it would hardly be worth while to make a cast when you have only to dip your hand in and select the finest from the whole school." "Well, that is a metaphor," laughed Helen, " that not every young lady could comprehend. But luckily for me we have a trout-stream on our place on Long Island; so I can, at the same time, understand the/figure, and feel grateful for the com- pliment." Helen made a little mock curtesy and laughed merrily, but her big eyes dropped fori a moment beneath Luther's ardent gatze. "But it is really," she continued, "a long time since we last met, and I see that time has not stood still with you either." "Not stood still exactly. He has been somewhat of a laggard," said Luther, "but I can't complain, as to-night 'he brings in his revenges.'" "Well, I won't be quite so malicious, or so out of the fash- ion, as to quote Shakespeare back at you and 'say, time hath transfixed the flourish set on youth,' but really you have changed very much." "For the better, I hardly dare to hope, in the eyes of Miss Helen Ledgeral." "Now you are fishing for a compliment, but you shan't catch it at the first throw; I was only going to say that when I persuaded Aunt Shippen to send you an invitation I hardly expected to see such an old gentleman." "'Old, but with eye and ear full sensed as yet To all her matchless beauty, grace, and wit,'" murmured Luther in a low tone, but giving emphasis to the quotation by a glance of intense, eager admiration. "Aunt Shippen's beauty, grace, and wit! well, I will tell her the compliment," laughed Helen; but notwithstanding her brave and mocking tone, her cheeks flushed and her eyes were cast down for a moment-she felt a little confused, a little bit 9   NE VER A GA IA.   I85   flurried, but certainly not displeased. Here was something in looks, tone, and manner evidently quite new,-so different from the nonchalance of Mr. Boggs ; the unutterable common- place of Jencks Jones; or the slang and downright stupidity of Billy Dugan and Bob Yadkins; sokiething evidently very verdant, unsophisticated and unfashionable; ridiculous even, -the idea of quoting Shakespeare! but something fresh and fragrant; something that seemed to speak of green fields and pastures new beyond the palings of Washington Square; something that produced an expanding sensation in and about the region of the aorta or the arter7 inznominata like an occa- sional line of Tennyson or Longfellow. - We mention these large blood-vessels to avoia saying heart, as the heart has been pretty well played out in society in these days; and we ought perhaps to beg pardon for a strong odor of "shop." But what is the use of writing M. D. to one's name, if, after the letters have wholly lost all dignity, they should not confer at least the poor privilege of being once in a while a little technical and anatomical? Helen felt herself being infolded and wrapped up in an atmosphere or influence of tender but impassioned solicitation, and, for the first time, she felt an inkling of that mysterious sensation, a yearning to yield. Suddenly she looked up with - laugh. "Come, Mr. Lansdale," she said," this will never do; quot- ing poetry in the drawing-room is against the rules. Listen tc the conversation going on around us ; and if you hear anything poetical, or witty, or clever, I'll let you quote the whole of your commonplace book to me some time. Come, I want to introduce you to Aunt Shippen. It seems Uncle Shippen has taken quite a liking to you." - To me!" said Luther; ' why, often as I have seen him in the counting-room, he never spoke five words to me." "That's just like Uncle Shippen. He doesn't say much, but he keeps up a tremendous thinking. Haven't you been promoted lately?" "Yes; I was custom-house clerk; looked after all the    I ooE VE VER A GA/IN. entries, and hurried up and helped the custom-house brokers and store-keepers. The other day, Mr. Gainsby said that he had noticed I spent a good deal of my spare time in studying the samples and the price-currents; and he wanted to know if J :hought I could undertake to fulfil a portion of the buying orders. I told him that I would do my best; so I at once mounted into a very pleasant position--mostly out-door work, and when I am through with my day's duties I am through with them,-no lingering office work; and when business is slack I have a good deal of time to myself." "You may depend upon it that was Uncle Shippen," said Helen. "He is a special partner, you know, and he don't have anything to do with the business. 'Tisn't right, you know, and I believe the law won't let him; but he (knows all about the clerks, and anything he recommends will be done. He told Aunt Shippen to ask you up here to-night. I was proposing to her to send you an invitation, and he said 'Do so, my dear; he looks as if he inherited a large share of the principle of longevity.'" ' "The principle of longevity!" exclaimed Luther, with a look and tone of extreme puzzlement. "That's the phrase," laughed Helen; "Uncle Shippen has it in his moufth very often. You must know he is a great phi- losopher and reformer; but he don't believe in any of the reforms that are advocated nowadays. He says that 'the true reform is a reform of the physical constitution of man." "A good idea," said Luther; " but I don't see how it can be carried out." "Nor I either," replied Helen; "but I hear uncle talk a great deal about cultivating the principle of longevity. Did you ever have a relative that lived to be very old?" "Yes, my mother's grandfather lived to a hundred and six." "A hundred and six! Well, your fortune is made with Uncle Shippen. I wonder if he could have heard about your great-grandfather. Did you ever tell, any one about him lately?" "Nobody but Mr. Whoppers. I   told him the story one   day. I don't know why, for the story is not very creditable or entertaining, but it i is true, and, when a boy, I always fan- cied there was something funny in it." "Nothing wrong, I'm sure," said Helen. "I couldn't be- lieve anything wrong of a man who had lived to be over a hundred. He must have had a clear conscience." "Oh, his conscience was clear enough," replied Luther, "but his habits were not the very best. He was a little red- headed Scotchman, and was very fond of his glass, so much so that during the last half of his long life he was never known to go to bed 'entirely sober.' That was my mother's phrase for his infirmity, but I believe they had to put him to bed every night quite tipsy. He, however, never thought himself intemperate, but rather prided himself upon his regu- lar habits. The best of men, however, will yield to tempta- tion some time or other, if they live long enough; and one night, after he had turned his hundredth year, he forgot him- self, and drank so much that he could not find his way home. It was the coldest night of a cold winter, and the old gentle- man was compelled to-fleep out in the snow and ice, on the banks of the Hudson, a mile or two from home. The next morning they found him frozen stark and stiff, but with hot blankets outside, and hot whiskey within, he gradually thawed out, and went to bed that night as jolly as ever. Six years more of regular habits proved that he had not suffered much from the exposure." "Well!" exclaimed Helen, "that is the very story I heard Mr. Whoppers telling Uncle Shippen, and that, you may depend upon it, is the real reason for your promotion." "That is too bad in you, Miss Ledgeral. I did not think you would be so unkind. You not only refuse me a compli- ment which you accuse me of fishing for, but you cut away the ground of a compliment that I was paying myself. I supposed that my promotion was due to an exhibition of my own virtues, and you make it out that it is all due to the vir- tues of my ancestors. But any way, I am rejoiced to have so much more time for study and amusement."    - 88        NE VER A GA IN. "And is writing verses a study or an amusement?" Luther colored at the imputation. "Ah, don't be surprised or frightened. I shan't proclaim your literary sins. I received a copy of verses with some flowers that I put to your credit, although there was no name."  "And have you nothing to give me in return?" demanded Luther. "Mr. Whoppers tells me that you write poetry, too." "No, no, I don't pretend to write poetry. I just made some rhymes the other day, and Mr. Whoppers teased me to let him see them." "And is Mr. Whoppers to be more favored than I?" "Oh, I am afraid of you-you are such ap old experienced poet. Mr./Whoppers showed me some veles thathe pub. lished in the Universe, beginning-- ' With counters-not with coin, ah! lady, know, I've ever played love's game with cautious art, But reckless now, on one mad desperate throw, I've ventured all the treasures of my heart.' He wouldn't tell me who was the author, but I was sure it was you." "And why sure?" demanded Luther.   "Because you thought they expressed sentiments exactly fitting my own case?" "Oh, no!" replied Helen, laughing and blushing. "I did not suppose you such an experienced gallant. If written in earnest I should think they would imply a man twice your age, and one who had been in love half-a-dozen times; but I know how often poets indulge in imaginary trials and troubles. Mr. Whoppers tells me that you have been writ- ing some verses about Imma and Englehard. Do you think it really was true that she carried her lover across the fresh fallen snow, in the court-yard at Aix-la-Chapelle, with Charle magne looking down upon her?  I should like to see you' version of the story. I suppose Mr. Whoppers will publisl them?" '   NE VER A GAIN.         189 "Nothing will give me greater delight than to send them to you, if you will permit me, except perhaps one thing." "And what is that?"; "That you will let me see some of your verses." "I tell you that I am afraid. I never show what I write to anybody; only just that once to Mr. Whoppers, and then he laughed at me." "You'll find me a much more sympathetic critic." "Will you tell me just what you think of them?" "I will, truly." "Well, then." "When shall I get them? now? Yes, yes, this evening!" "Oh, pshaw! we must go now. What will Aunt Shippen say? She told me to bring you up and introduce you. We are going to dance in a few minutes." I "I hope I am to have the honor and the pleasure of your hand." "Yes, once." "Only once?" "Well then, twice. I have saved a quadrille and a galop for you, but I am going to introduce you to two or three very nice girls, for the other dances; see that you dance and talk and flirt your best now. They are very good girls ; just from boarding-school, and they are a little exigeantes; no boy's play will suit them." "But, Miss Ledgeral, you frighten me; I am afraid I shall not do honor to your presentation. There's Mr. Boggs ; I see him over there talking to your sister. He is more com- petent, I should think, from what I have heard Mr. Whoppers say of him, to play the gallant to such formidable young ladies. Permit me to decline-" "No, no; Mr. Boggs is too grand a being for us girls. But first we'll go to Aunt Shippen." Helen took Luther's arm, and led the way into the back room. Mr. Whoppers stopped them for a moment, and after jest- ingly making his compliments to the young lady, whispered   I90o        NE VER AGAIN.  n Luther's ear--"Take care, young one, you are going the pace a little too fast; you'll have the eyes of all in the room on you if you let the spoons stick out at every wink of your eye,--poc poco, as we say in Spain; there now, don't flush up like a young turkey-cock. Recollect this is a round game; papa and mamma and half-a-dozen others have got a hand in it, and you can't go it alone:" Mr. Whoppers glided off-bowing and smiling and shak. ing hands. A desperate fellow in the hand-shalking line was " the editor of the Unziverse. "I'd like to give him one good clip under the ear," mour. mured Luther to himself: the schoolboy's phrase for a sudl den, severe, and deserved punishment almost flashing out into an audible threat. The next moment he was making his bow to Aunt Shippen.  *  +  * X X X      cd Aunt Shippen, nee Van Scoutenhorn, was a born aristk,- crat, and she looked like it,--not like the aristocrat of the modern novel, but like the aristocrat of actual society, here, or in the noble circles of European society. She was not quite so fat and ungainly in figure as the Duch- ess-of Grasston, or as the Hon. Mrs. Lowdingtop; she had not such big hands and splay feet as the Countess of Dree- lincourt: she had not such a rough and parchmenty skin as the Princess of Moestricht; she had not such a coarse voice, half snuffle and half screech, as Madame La Baronne de la Roche Gammon, but she was nevertheless a born aristocrat. She could count back her ancestors seven or eight gene- rations, to the days of Walter Von Twiller; and the line, like other lines, had had its mutations. The beginning was per- haps involved in a little obscurity. Dubious rumor spoke of a decaying cooper's shop near the Visch Markt, in Old Am- sterdam, and then of its vigorous offshoot near the V,/i iarkt in the New. Be that as it may, the adventurous cadet of the adz and hoop-pole soon erected his staff or staves to some purpose.  He married a Ten Broeck; and the one-legged hero of Curagoa,--the illustrious Captain-General of all the   NLE'VER AGAIN.          191I Dutch transatlantic provinces-Peter Stuyvesant, upon his arrival, found a Van Scoutenhorn a foremost burgher; a member of the council; an official of weight and substance; a man of bigger nether garments, longer pipes, and more schnapps than any other in New Amsterdam. Altogether a right-worshipful, and weighty man; and his wife and daugh- ters leaders 'in the very van of fashionable life. You see the point here? It is all the same as when some Coulthorp goes right back beyond the days of William and Harold to the time of Agricola, and calling the roll of Cen- turions, fastens upon the veritable Coultatus who started his line; or like some of those happy souls who can throw the -doomsday survey aside, and point to the very grounds tilled by their great-grandfathers in the time of Canute, or out of Iwhich they were hustled during the troubles of the Heptar- chy. Talk of the Conquest! Pshaw! that is very, very modern. Curiosity once induced some genealogical inquiries in Normandy as to one of the adventurous seiglneurs who vis- ited England under the auspices of William. "Yes, I recol- lect," said our venerable informant, a citizen of Caen, "that a cadet did accompany the Conqueror. His name is upon the monument erected not. many years ago in commemora- tion of the expedition, but I have never kept the run of that younger branch of the family. You see we go directly back beyond Rollo, and not being compelled to stop at the time of the great duke and English king, I have never thought to make any inquiry about our English collaterals." In this way the Van Scoutenhorns dated back beyond the Anglo-Saxon conquest of New Amsterdam, beyond the gov- ernorship of Peter the Testy, into the autocthonic times of Walter the Doubter. Then came the Conquest-the great Peter retired in sulky dignity to his bozeterie, and then and there planted the famous pear-tree in whose shadows have rested his descendants to the present day. The Van Scout- enhorns remained active traders and good subjects under the English dynasty, but, in the third or fourth generation, misfortune came and pushed the family down from the glories    192        XE VER AGAIN. of a big brick trading and dwelling-house in Coenties Slip t( a small market-garden away out of town. But, in the time of Mrs. Shippen's grandfather, there was again a change. Tlh city grew and grew, and with insatiate fury overleaping all presupposed bounds, gobbled up the garden grounds of the Van Scoutenhorns and turned them  into a beautiful and easily digested mass of twenty-five foot lots. The yield was tremendous; garden "sass" was nowhere; early radishes and green peas got their go-by; and the different families of the Tuberosa-Solanum  and Lycopersicum-bloomed no longer; no not even in the memory of a Van Scoutenhern. Miss Van Scoutenhorn was a belle and a beauty after her kind, and as she had some money, it was somewhat surprising to her friends that she should step a little out of her set to marry young Shippen. But she knew what she was about. She was not, perhaps, desperately in love, but the liking was sufficiently strong and mutual. What cared she what society said? She'd let society know that she'd do as she pleased; she'd walk over it and through it, and make it get down on its knees to any man whose name she should see fit to adopt She felt her position; and she knew hey powers of attack when supported by the inexhaustible affluence which the vig- orous and rising merchant was sure to attain. Van Amburg entering the den of wild animals with a heavy iron bar close at hand in case of any outhurst of fury, was a favorite figure of hers. "It is, not alone the iron rod that is necessary in such a case," she used to say; " he must have an iron heart and muscles of steel; and so in going among the bears and lions and jackals of society you must have a big bar of gold, and the will and the strength and the skill to use it; swing it deftly and whack away right and left stoutly, and you can make the wild beasts dance to any tune you lease." One thing was wanting to Mrs. Shippen's happiness; she had no children. And this had led to her seizing upon and almost wholly appropriating her husband's niece, Helen I,edg- eral. At least half of the young girl's time was spent at her aunt's; and even when residing at home it came to be tacitly   NEVE 'R AGAI.          93 admitted that no one was to have anything to say as to her general and particular training, her studies, her dressing, her amusements, except Uncle and Aunt Shippen. Lucky girl, one may exclaim, to have been subjected to such influences, to have been released from the feeble, vacillating sway of ego- tistic and selfish, but over indulgent, parental affection,-the chief characteristic of American households,-to have been saved from the pretentious and demoralizing slip-slop, or worse, of the boarding-school, or the depuderizing freedoms of the watering-place hotel. But it would be wrong to keep Luther, modest youth as he was, bowing too long; although he had a rare talent for bow- ing gracefully-the natural product of his withy and compact figure. Aunt Shippen held out her hand graciously; she would have done that to almost any young man to whom she had vouchsafed a presentation. In most cases the movement did not mean much. Her style was the complaisant and the con- descending, she could not be rude or even brusque, except to pretentious, pushing vulgarity, and besides she had a pretty hand, and a graceful movement of the wrist and elbow; and the manual salutation, when rightly manlaged, admits of such a variety of expression, from' the languid indifference of the extreme finger-tip, to the cordial grasp of profound esteem, and so on up to the rapturous devotion of the perfectly invol- untary grip a deux mains.  In Luther's case the salutation grew more cordial as her glance took in more fully his fine face and figure. In truth, youth and good looks will have their influence, even with women of fifty,-perhaps all the more because they are women of fifty,-something of the motherly qualifying the admiration, and more than making up for any decreased sensibility to the influence of matured masculine charms. She drew Luther down to a seat on the sofa beside her. "So you are the hero of the steamboat adventure," she said. "I have heard of you very often, and I hear a very good report of you." 13   x 94        NE VER A GA IN.  "I feel very much flattered," stammered Luther, blushing and bowing, "but I can be called the hero only by way of ridicule, as I did nothing heroic, and had nothing to do with it but as a sufferer in common with others.", "Ah,)  ible, but sensitive, I see," exclaimed Mrs. Ship. pen. "Well, I won't call you a hero again, unless you do something very grand to cdserve it. But if not a hero, I hear that you are a very we conducted young man, and an ,excellent clerk, and that you are clever with your pen too. Don't let it run away with you : you want to be rich, I sup. pose?" "Who does not in this age of the world, and in this com- munity?" demanded Luther, with a smile. "I am not beyond or above the influences that surround me. I hope to be rich. I intend to be rich." "Rich! well you can't help wishing to be rich, I suppose, but .is that all? Have you no ideal beyond that? Ah, I know you have, and' I should be sorry for you if you had not, but don't let your ideal lead you out of the road at first." "You think that the best way is to get money first, and follow the ideal afterwards?" said Luther. "Yes; there is one trouble about that, however. By the time the money is got, the ideal is apt to slip away from one, and there is nothing left but the poor and bald reality of wealth;-you must guard against that. Better get hold'of some hobby and ride it to death, as Mr. Shippen does, than to sit down as many of our rich men do in sheer weariness upon their money-bags, and give up all kinds of intellectual exer- tion and all efforts, or even wishes, for mental or moral im- provement." "Will you allow me to ask," demanded Luther, "what kind of a hobby Mr. Shippen pleases himself with?" "Oh, I should have said hobbies," replied Mrs. Shippen. "You know he is connected with the firm only as special partner. He has ro business to occupy him, and sometimes he mounts one hobby and sometimes another. He thinks himself something of a scholar and something -of a philoso-   rNEVER AGAIN. A95 pher. His present hobby is the physical regeneration and improvement of the human race." "I suppose that means the improvement of the physical conditions of human life," said Luther, hesitatingly. "No, I rather think that he is in favor of letting the sad conditions of human life work out their final results. tHe has borrowed some nonsense about the necessity of a struggle for existence, and all that kind of thing. But we won't get into a discussion of the subject. 'Tisn't exactly a topic for the drawing-room,"' said Mrs. Shippen, smiling. "Your name," she continued, " seems quite familiar to me. I do not mean from your adventure, or your connection with the affairs of the firm. I have some associations with your name that date from much further back. I knew a good many years ago a Col. Samuel Lansdale: he was once quite a society-man. Was he a relative of yours? I have not seen or heard any- thing of him for a long time." "I presume," said Luther, " that youhave reference to my father. He has been dead for a number of years." "Oh yes, it seems to -me now that I remember to have heard of his death." The conversation continued for a few minutes in relation t/Luther's family, and to his own adventures since his arrival in New York. Aunt Shippen put a good many kind inquiries as to his duties and his amusements, and encouraged him in the expression of some of his general tastes and likings, until they were interruipted by a movement among the younger people, which indicated the opening of the dance. Helen rushed up to her aunt. "Oh, aunty, I want Mr. Lansdale as a partner for Julia Deen. I have promised him to her. Come and let me present you." "My dear," interrupted Aunt Shippen, " one moment. Three things," and she held up her finger with a gesture and look of mock severity.  "First, don't rush so. Walk; don't run; leave that to that Thompson girl; next, don't speak quite so loud ; leave that to your friends the Trelawnys ; and as to young girls dragging young gentlemen round helter-   196        NE VE R A GAI r.  skelter and introducing them to other young girls, just leave that to your sister and Miss Yadkins. I'll take Mr. Lans- dale across to Miss Deen and introduce him." Aunt Shippen rose and took Luther's arm. "I was in hopes," whispered Luther to Helen, " that you were coming to claim me as a partner for yourself."' "I don't claim'my partners-they claim me," replied Helen, with a saucy little nod of the head. "Tru in general; but when the partner is nothing but a slave--the veriest slave, you could condescend to order him." ' Slaves can wait.:' "Until when?" demanded Luther. "Well, until the third dance after this." ' I suppose you think," said Aunt Shippenr "that I am quite a dragon; but when I see the way the young people are going on nowadays, I can't help getting really provoked. I am not at all an advocate for undue restraint, but I think a little pretension to youthful feminine delicacy; a small modicum of modesty and gentleness; a fews indications of a lingering respect for the notions and feelings of people who have attained the venerable age of thirty-five years and up- t wards; wouldn't be too much to ask. Do you think it would, Mr. Whoppers?" she exclaimed, as the Editor of the Universe checked his bustling and erratic movements for a moment at her side. "Certainly not. 'Ask and it shall be granted unto you.' Beg pardon-no irreverence: the quotation slipped out; but what is it about?" "I don't suppose you meant any irreverence, Mr. Whop- pers. We all know your weakness in the matter of quota- tions. But in this case it was singularly unfortunate and in- applicable. You may ask as much as you please and you will get no consideration or politeness out of the rising gener- ation, with some few exceptions. I was lecturing this young gentleman upon the present Style of manners. Not that I think he particularly needs it."   NE VE R A G I     .    19 7 "Bow, Luther!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "Why don't you bow? that is a nice compliment; and from such a source! If it were my case, I should have to go down on my knees- but I see! a blush will do as well! A lecture upon the pres- ent style of manners may be unnecessary, but it could not have been tiresome; it must have been short; almost as short as Archbishop Pontipidian's celebrated chapter on snakes in Iceland:' 'There are no snakes in Iceland.' Lecture by Mrs. Shippen on the Manners of Young America: 'Young Amer- ica has no- manners, and it is growing more so every day.' There is but one remedy, Mrs. Shippen. Let all the middle- aged people rise in revolution and exterminate the young ones." "Another massacre of the innocents," suggested Luther. "Hardly, for if we should all turn Herods I don't know where we would find the innocents. No, it isn't another He- rod that we want; it is a- little more of the-rod. Ha! ha! that's good, isn't it? I must find my friend Ledgeral, and stick it into him ; I'll demonstrate to him that if we could once restore the-rod, we could divide it into the he-rod and the she- rod, and tickle the innocents into good manners without quite killing them." "Mr. Whoppers is a. friend of yours?" demanded Mrs. Shippen of Luther. "Yes," answered Luther hesitatingly; and for an instant that meanest, most unmanly, and yet most common of all sen- timents'-the fear of compromising one's self in the opinion of some social potentate or power, tempered his tone of voice. 'Twas but for an instant. He had a good natural fund of honest moral courage; besides, he had studied Thackeray on snobs; and come what might, he was not going to sacrifice to fashion, or opinion, or personal influence, his firm convictions or his honest sentiments, and make himself a contemptible, -heartless, characterless social flunky. No, not he; and the blush .with which he continued in a more firm tone, was due rather to shame at his momentary weakness than to any sense of Mr. Whoppers' fashionable shortcomings. "Yes, Mr.   I98         NE VER AGAIN. Whoppers is my friend, I am very happy to say, and a very good and useful friend he has been to me. W live together in the same house." Aunt Shippen was a woman of the world, and had had too much social experience not to comprehend from Luther's tone and looks exactly what was passing through his mind. She gave him a glance of increasing admiration, as she replied: '"Mr. Whoppers, I believe, is a very reputable man. I don't like his class or his profession; but I suppose there is a differ- ence among editors and reporters. I don't know much about them personally; but by what I can see of what they call the amenities of journalism, I should judge that in general they have more talent than taste, more wit than manners. However, there mustsbe exceptions, and some of them are unquestion- ably gentlemen. Mr. Whoppers is well enough; and, some- times, a very faulty friend may be a very useful one to a young man, if a discrimination is made between the good qualities and the faults ; between what to admire or imitate, and- what to condemn and avoid. Mr. Whoppers' manner and style, you see for yourself, is not as quiet and polished as it might be ; a little more suavity and a little more reticence would improve him. But here is your partner; I suppose it won't do to keep so important a person as a girl just from boarding-school wait- ing any longer."   CHAPTER XI. A Neologist-Uncle Shippen takes Luther's Measure-Joseph's Device-- The Cardinal's Tears--Miss Yadkins and the Baronet--Cure for the English Accent-Helen's Poetry--A Terrible Mistake-A First Lesson in, French. HE sudden introduction to each other of two practised 1 people of the world, when neither one has the slightest knowledge of the other's antecedents, or the slightest clue to the occupations, opinions, or tastes of his opponent, is fre- quently a very awkward affair. It reminds one of the famous duel in the dark, which has so often been dished up in various forms for the delectation of sensation-lovers. Luckily Luther and his partner, like all young people of their ages, were not very dangerously armed; and a contest wimli headless lances, pointless swords, and small potato pop- guns is hardly worth describing. Suffice it to say that Luther acquitted himself quite to his partner's satisfaction, if not entirely to his own, albeit there were none of those brilliant sallies, epigrammatical flashes and witty repartees the very youngest people of the modern novel are apt to indulge in. Luther's shortcomings were partly owing to mental preoc- cupation. He could not keep his mind, and occasionally his eye, from wandering to another set, where the graceful form of Helen Ledgeral was floating about in a foam of white tulle. Luckily the dance is not exacting in the way of conversation, and his partner did not perceive his distraction. One can caper, slide, bow, smile and simper in almost any state of the head or heart.- That is the great advantage of the dance for very young people, who in general have no conversation. What would they do without it? Think of it, ye who would proscribe it totally because some of its forms are of question- e   200        NEVER AGA IN. able decency, or because with an older set it is often a cover, or perhaps an incitement, to dangerous flirting or downright intrigue. Luther bowed his partner to her seat, and was withdrawing when he felt a hand upon his shoulder; and turning, found himself confronted by a smiall, stout, elderly gentleman in blue broadcloth and white waistcoat of the olden pattern, across which diagonalized a broad black ribbon, which might have been mistaken for some foreign order, but which merely served to support a pair of tortoise-shell eye-glasses. A thick pad- ded neckcloth encircled a stiff shirt-collar, which, extending upon both cheeks to an utterly unfashionable height, enclosed almost half of the bald head. This alone would have been a protest against the modern style of men's attire, but this pro- test was deepened into an expression of absolute contempt by a shirt-frill crimped with great skill and care. One involunta- rily looked at the hand for lace ruffles; and even breeches and silk stockings would have astonished nobody. But if dis- appointed in these, the eyes were more than gratified by the sight of a wide, high coat-collar, and brass waist-buttons up nearly to the shoulders. And this was a neologist! Yes, Uncle Shippen was a neologist; and this intense conservatism or old-fogyism in outward dress was nothing but a kind of balance to the new- ness of his mental habillements. The latest cut in theory and opinion he demanded for his ideas; for his body, his tailor must not vary a hair's breadth from the fashions of fifty years ago. The latest teachings in every department of science were his delight. The doctrine of the correlation of forces and the theory of evolution were too well settled to afford mnuch exercise to his faculties, but spontaneous generation had been a fruitful field. He had wandered from Pasteur to Bas- tian over and over again, and under the latest telescopic and spectroscopic investigations he had changed his opinion of the constitution of the sun at least half-a-dozen times. Motioning to Luther to follow him, he led the way into and across the hall, and with a wave of his hand indicated a chair   VNEVER AGAIN.         201 just within the dining-room door. A wreath or rope of flowers across the entrance was old Joseph's device for intima- ting that the magnificent spectacle of cut glass, flowers, fruit and spun-sugar was " tabooed 'until, at the proper time, and at his own good pleasure, he should see ft to load the sparkling board with the hot smoking substantials of the supper. Luther of course hesitated to enter, but Uncle Shippen raised the barrier. "Come in, come in here," he exclaimed; i we shall be quite alone here. Now sir, sit down," and sud- denly putting his hand into his coat-pocket he pulled out a formidable pair of calipers and opened them. "Now sir, per- mit me. Sit still, sir, sit still!" Luther did not know whether to sit still or to jump up and make a dash for the parlor. The old gentleman was mad evi- dently, and was going to try some surgical operation on him; or perhaps he was a freemason, and was going to initiate him on the spot; or may be a missionary, and about to perform some religious rite; or could it be that this was one of the customs of good society? Curiosity held him undecided for a minute, but that was enough. Uncle Shippen applied the points o the calipers to his temples, and starting back, adjusted his eye-glass, and read off the figures on the slide. "Nearly six inches!" he exclaimed in the tone of one who had made some happy discovery. "I thought so; and now, sir, from the root of the nose to the orifice of the ear. There, there. Splendid! I Iknew it. You get it from your great- grandfather-and let me see, a perpendicular from a circle cutting the head through the eyebrow and the occipital pro- tuberance to the orifice of the ear must be at least an inch and three-quarters : and the ear itself-soft, yet firm as leather," and the old gentleman pulled away at the young man's ear,- Luther sitting perfectly quiet and looking up with a sense of the comical beginning to qualify somewhat his fright and astonishment. "Permit me," continued Uncle Shippen; and suddenly producing and unrolling a tape measure, he held one end of it 9   202        NEIVER AGAIN. on the front edge of the chair with one hand, and stretched the other up to the top of Luther's breast-bone. "' Good heavens, sir! over twenty-six inches, and full-cllested besides! Go, sir, and thank heaven for such a rich inheritance from your great- grandfather. A hundred and six! just to think of it! I knew. it-I knew the indications must correspond," muttered the old gentleman. "I will watch that fellow; he must not throw his great inheritance away upon anything in the feeble vitality and deficient longevity line." "So you have been under Uncle Shippen's calipers," said Heien. "I saw him take you aside. He is just the best dear old uncle that ever any one had; but he will produce those awful measuring instruments at the most awkward times. I hope your indications were all right?" "Indications of what?" "Of longevity! Do you know that Uncle Shippen can tell you just how long your life will last? Isn't it-awful?" -"I should prefer to have him tell me how long this happi- ness will last." ' What happiness?" "The happiness of this dance ; I hear the first bars of a waltz, I believe it is my turn now." "Oh, I can tell you that. Just one turn." "Let it be a long one, then," said Luther, as he passed his arm around her waist and led off with a peculiarly easy and vigorous step that is always a rare endowment of nature, rather than a product of art. "Who is he?" demanded Mrs. Struggles of Miss Ledgeral. "Oh, he's nothing but one of papa's clerks,' replied that young lady with a slight curl of her lips. "I suppose it's some of Aunt Shippen's doings." It's a pity, my dear," replied Mars. Striuggles, " that your Aunt Shippen was not a little more considerate of people's feelings; she ought to keep common people, young and old, in their place. It is .very awkward meeting persons you don't want to know." Miss Ledgeral gave Mrs. Struggles a swift supercilious   NE V ER, A GAIN.        203  glance, and turned away without making any reply. Her ex- pression, could it have been interpreted in words, would have simply said: "You are a pretty one to talk about common people; and, if I find fault with Aunt Shippen, I am not going to permit you to do so too." Mrs. Struggles understood it all; but she was used to snubs, and was quite willing to submit to them froln some quarters, since through the favor of her friend Mrs. Ledgeral she had attained a certain hold in society which enabled her to snub a good many people formerly her betters, in return. Joseph had at last condescended to order the barrier of evergreens and flowers removed from the dining-room door. The announcement that supper-time had arrived was received with a degree of languor and indifference that quite astonished Luther, after the experience he had had at two or three alder- manic balls to which he hld been invited, at the instance of Mr. Whoppers, and from an extensive study of the manners and customs of American society in the pages of British writ- ers who have visited this country, and of many equally good authorities .who have not. Still the clash and clatter grew, and the movement towards the supper-ropm increased in volume, until there was, as Mr. Whoppers said, jam enough for twice the bread and butter-a case of jam satis. "Don't be in a hurry, my dear fellow," he continued, tapping Luther in the shoulder. "Help the ladies, but don't eat anything yet yourself: a little gallantry now is a good investment at the price. It's a case of virtue'its own rexward, you know. Joseph is reserving a dish of hot terrapin for the last, and he won't 'open that Latour Blanche till I give him the wink. Watch Boggs, he knows the ropes; you won't see him eat anything until the feminine feeders are filled." The hubbub increases, everybody is talking, which is not at all strange; but everybody is eating, which is a little strange, considering that not one in ten of the guests would dream of going to bed on a hot supper at home, from a wholesome fear, or perhaps a positive assurance, that they would dr m11 pretty thoroughly upon it afterwards.   204         NE VER4 AGA,4 IN. Luther looks around for Miss Helen Ledgeral. Alasi there is no chance for him: half-a-dozen gray-haired fellows have almost struggled for the preference, and she is in the centre of a group of old fogies, who, allured byv her smiles, hop out of their holes of selfish habit, as lively as toads in the spring sunshine. It is rather a good sign when a young girl is able to ex- cite the rusty gallantry of " grave and reverend seigniors : " to interest them, make them talk, and exert themselves to enter- tain her. It is rather a good sign, inasmuch as it indicates a certain esprit which all girls do not have; and a certain ad- mixture of sense and sensibility. It indicates that the abso. lute and universal in youthful feminine attractions is not en- tirely overlaid by the temporary conventionalities, the immedi- are youthful whims, fantasies and fashions of the hour. Luther sees that there is no chance for him at the moment, and he therefore resigns himself to Miss Julia Deen ; but, her wants supplied, he suddenly dashes with generous gallantry to the aid. of two elderly ladies who seem to him to have less attention. paid them than the others; and makes himself very active in supplying their wants ; very much to their astonish- ment, but evidently not at all to their displeasure. Poor fel. low! he is so unsophisticated-so very verdant, it is quite excusable in him. With his limited social experience, how can he know that middle-aged or elderly females have no claim upon youth of any kind : and that it is not etiquette, if they are plain and not very fashionable, and don't keep houses of entertainment, to treat them with any attention, or even to offer to save them from absolute starvation by even so much as a single meringue or an ice. An encouraging smile from Helen, which he catches over the mass of heads, would have rewarded him, even had he fully known what an oddity he was making of himself. Relieved after a while from his duties of waiter, Luther amuses himself by listening to the conversation going on around him. He tries to catch- it as it falls on either side of him, and a queer jumble he makes,of it.   Let us follow him   NE VER AGAIN.         205 for a moment as he flits from group to group. Nothing would be more absurd than to attempt to give the chaff, the slang, the personal gossip and the social cant, having meaning and point only to the ears .of " our set," which passes as conver- sation at balls and parties-most of it commonplace, a good deal of it stupid and utterly inane. There is, however, some- times here and there a group of interesting people, and, if you listen closely, now and then a remark that strikes and sticks. There is, for instance, old Rhindergelt with a heaped up plate of oysters "and chicken salad in his hand; he is an able man, and interesting, if you like his line of 'talk: "I tell you what I'll do; I 'll sell you a call, buyer thirty, for a thousand shares for a thousand dollars! You think that the preferred is going up. Maybe, but the common is bound to fall off ten per cent. in the next ten days. Now mind I tell you." You don't like such kind of talk for the drawing-room? Ah! I see you don't; you turn away, you donrt appreciate it! if you did you would go right down the next morning and invest in the common stock of Arkansas Central, and perhaps turn an honest penny or two before dinner. Well, you need not listen to it-it is exceptional at best. 'But hark! here is something about art-not very profound perhaps, but still it is pleasant to hear a pretty girl expatiate upon Turner, and Durand, acnd I Kensett, and Church, and Bier- stadt, and the Academy, aid the Metropolitan Art Gallery, even if the epithets charming, lovely, beautiful, are sprinkled about a little too freely. And then here is somnething! What animation! you can't catch it all, only now and then a word, but the subject is clear: the Opera,-Parepa-Rosa,- - Nilsson,--Verdi,-Wagner,-music of the future,-Beetloven's Mass in D,-the Eroica,-symphony in C. Very good, indeed, and quite bearable, inasmuch as the so2pon of ' Shakespeare and the musical glasses' is so very slight. And then books -the last novel. "' You don't like rrollope?"  "No, I'm getting tired of him." "But he is so natural." True, but he writes too much. - Toujours per'drix, you know-ha! ha!   sUU       JVV yVL&KV Al CA^jIV. Give me George Eliot's last book-splendid! powerful! women novelists! beat the men," and then a confused-jumble of names-Charles Reade,-Browning,-Swinburne.  "Oh horrid! no lady; I don't care-I read him. Greatest poet  Hawthorne,-Longfellow,-and Mrs. Stowe." It takes the group about twenty minutes to run through the whole circle of modern literature. Luther turns away to another group, attracted by the tones of a loud and clear voice pronouncing the name of Dickens. It was the voice of Uncle Shippen. "Nw I lay this down, sir, as a fundamental test of longevity-that if a book which has given me great delight at its first appearance, say twenty years ago, upon a second reading, after that or a longer inter- val, still continues to give me as much or more delight, that book has the principle of longevity in a high state of concen- tration. But if upon the second reading I find that it falls far short of my first conceptions-if I find the characters are not what I had supposed them to be-that they are absurd and rather coarse exaggerations; in a word, if I find that, how- ever clever it may be, it does not come up to the idea I had at first formed, then, sir, I doubt whether that book has that principle of longevity that will carry it much beyond its own generation into the coming ages. You see the lapse of twenty years serves as a base-line, and having the angle of my first conceptions, I take the angle of my last conceptions, and a perpendicular from the point of intersection to the base indi- cates the probable longevity of the book." "That is," interposes Mr. Whoppers, " you act as a kind of posterity to your own conceptions-you father your own grandfather, and become a son to yourself." There is no sense or point in this observation, but when- ever Mr. Whoppers puts in his word there is always a dispo- sition to'laugh. 'Now take Dickens' books," continues Uncle Shippen, unheeding the impertinent interruption, " and apply this test, and I think you will find that they do not comprise a body of literature that will live forever.'          NL VERK A GAII.        207 To this opinion there are several dissenters, and the dis- cussion branches off in various directions. Martin Chuzzlewit is mentioned. "How do you like the American scenes?" "Poor, sir, comically poor! But the most comical thing is that an apology should have been thought necessary. I never saw or heard yet of an American who has expressed the slightest anger at them. Many a one has felt provoked with Dickens that he did not put more point and force and truth in them-there was such a good chance, and no one would have objected to the lash well laid on, even if it did tingle his own hide a little; but all Dickens' American work is so dauby that there is no light of consciousness in which we can hang it that makes it look like a picture at all. It is a kind of thrashing' roundabout with a ridiculous old broom-handle, rather than a-raw-hide. He'reminds one of a blind teamster, -he whirls his whip around his head quite vigorously, and makes a devil of a cracking, but never really touches the raw. "Ah! the best plan for us would be to import the whole staff of the Saturday. They would walk into us. Here's to their health," continues the speaker, refilling his glass of champagne. "I won't say more power to their arm, for they have enough of it, but more knowledge to their noddles." "I should say that the Blackwood fellows would be the best; we never have been touched up properly vet, and there is a clever malignity about them that would send their sneers. home if they were only aimed right." "It would be of no use; they would bring their ideal Yankee with them, and content themselves with sticking pins into the poor devil forever, leaving our hides unscratched." "Well, we could at least disabuse them of one notion which is about as thoroughly ingrained into John Bull's mind as any conception of things transatlantic can well be, and that is, that we are so sensitive as to' what is said and thought of us across the water. It was perhaps so once, but times have changed. We have gone through three wars.  The first achieved our political independence, the second achieved our mercantile independence, and our last grand affair has pretty \   208        NVER VE AGAIN. effectually achieved our social independence. I don't think that we shall ever take much offence at what our kind cousins may see fit to say of us in future." "Oh! we never did take offence at what they said. There is the great mistake which they have always made. If we have been offended it has been at the way the thing is said. They cry 'Don't wince, my dear fellow. Don't we satirize and abuse, and ridicule and blackguard people, and manners, and customs, and matters and things in general, at home just as freely?' Ah, so you do, Mr. Bull, and the Lord knows you have mighty good room and reason for it. But the difference is just this: that when you show up the coarseness and brutal- ity, and vulgarity, and criminality of your own household, there is always some epithet or allusion-something said, or perhaps something not said--something in the tone, which enables a reader to understand that the satire or the sneer does not apply to everybody or everything in the tight little island,-but when you come to cut up your cousins you make one general and universal mass of mince-meat of 'em." "You mean," interrupts Mr. Whoppers, "that Bull would do so if his hatchet were heavy enough and the handle of sufficient length." "Exactly! but he dks his level best. He hacks away without apparently the slightest shadow of an idea that there is the least refinement of mind or manner, elevation of feeling, culture, taste, honesty, pure diction or sound English in the wh61le country." "That reminds me,"- interposes one of the group, " of a story of Washington Allston, as told by one of the English- men present at the scene. Allston was the only American among a large party, one of whom, sneering at America and Americans, observed that he had never seen an American g'ntleman. Allston rose from his seat, straightened himself up, and in a quiet and composed tone said,*' Sir, I am an American gentleman.' The sensation was marked, and cor- dially sympathetic, and the amplest apologies atoned for what was, of course, as they were all gentlemen, the result of-   NAE VER A GA IN.        209 carelessness or forgetfulness, rather than of conscious inso- lence." "Oh, I'll tell you," exclaims Mr. Whoppers, "how, it is. The Judge here hasn't more than half explained the matter. You see it all comes of the newspapers. I'll show you just how it is, there isn't a squib, sneer, lie, slander nor piece of ridicule, satire or abuse of any kind in the English journals that is not at once transferred to our papers, and read by hun- dreds of thousands. We like it-so far so good; but what galls us is that we can't get in a lick in return. We have no way of blackguarding back. Look at the boys: one calls the other a scallawag; what a satisfaction it is to the juvenile mind to reply 'You're another.' ' I'll slap your chops for you.' 'Ifye do, you'll get yer nose smashed.' Everything is all set- tled, because that account is perfectly square-it balances exactly."         / "Ha! ha! I see what Whoppers is after: he wants to get us to raise a fund for printing a hundred thousand copies of the Universe for gratuitous distribution over the water." "The best thing you could do," cries Mr. Whopper; " no missionary work equal to it! I'd enlighten 'em. I'd pitch into them--vulgarity, brutality, general beastliness, bad man- ners, universal cant, confirmed philistinism, crime, pauper- ism, flunkyism, horrid accent, corrupt English, and diaboli- cal grammar! I'd give 'em as good as they send, and I'd produce a cordial state of feeling between the twocountries' in six months' time that would render any real disagreement between them impossible. We wouldn't have any more am- bassadors, or ministers, or high commissioners, or private self-appointed representatives of the two nations standing up at dinner-tables and slopping over their twaddle about blood and race and community of language and confraternity of feeling, and all that stuff." "Ha! ha! suppose we raise a few hundred thousand, and hand the money over to Whoppers?  Who'll head the list with ten thousand?" "He don't get a cent from me, unless he promises to go "   2I0        NEVER AGA IN. straight for the 'bloated aristocracy,'-that's the veritable American bugaboo,-ha! ha! ha." Luther had listened long enough to the loitering old fogies of the supper-room, and was turning away when a deli- cate attention from Joseph arrested him on his way to the parlors. "Looker heah, sar. I olberve dat you don't took nothing 'cepting one glass ob Champagne. Dat is berry ob- stemerous, and I like to see it in a young man, but, sar, I got just one bottle here ob Maderie dat I'm gwine to open. Born sar in de last centuary.

I say, Shaw! what's de use of throwing pearls before hogs, eh! 'Taint appreciumated 'cepting by jus' a few fellars, like de old Judge dare. Please step dis way, sar." "But," objected Luther, "I don't know anything about wine: I couldn't tell Madeira from Sherry." "Dat's jess it. Dat's why I gib it to you. Jess so dat when somebody axes your 'pinion some time you can say, 'Well, purty good,-but-but-it don't quite come up to de Goa wine ob '86.'" And Joseph smacked his lips and shut his eyes and rolled his head as if he was in all the agonies of connoisseurship. "I gib you dis glass furs, cause dose old fellars 'specting someting. Dey know what's coming, and once I say, 'Judge, de Cardinal waits for you,' you wouldn't stand no more chance dan a little wiggle-waggle in a pailful of pollywogs." Luther wanders into the parlors. Where is she? He can see nothing of her. The lights; the music; the babble of voices.; the crush; the confusion seem to have increased; although the crowd is really thinning out; and a number of people are hurrying up-stairs to the dressing-room, and sev- eral shawled and cloaked figures can be seen in the hall. A: small, but rather stylish-looking girl, with a very inno- cent expression of countenance, is standing close beside him. Luther recognizes her as the noted Minnie Yadkins. Mr.   Vj VE'R' AGA N.        2" Whoppers had pointed her out to him in the early part of the evening. She is talking with a tall, handsome specimen of  English aristocracy, Sir Charles Flukes, who has just arrived. He is decidedly lucky in falling, at his first party, into the hands of so accomplished aln artist as Miss Minnie Yadkins. That is, however, as people may think. His style,-made up for the market,-is most praise- worthy. It may be described as the Hdon't-believe-it-awl, you know-the desirous-of-instruction and open-to-conviction- in fact, the conciliatory and condescendingly inquiring-style. Clearly he was determined to see for himself whether the Americans really do spit the flowers and figures of their Moquettes and Axminsters out of sight; or endanger the mass- ive bronzes, or the delicate Dresden and Wedgwood ware of their mantel-pieces, with their boot-heels. Luther listens with all-his ears. "I observe with great pleasure, Miss Yadkins, that the Americans speak much better English than I had supposed." "Indeed! Oh, I am so delighted. We have improved, very much improved, of late years. Do you know it was formerly very difficult for you English to understand us. I'll tell you a veritable story. When I was a little girl, a good many years ago, we were all staying at the Hotel des A4pes at Interlachen. The large drawing-room of the hotel was filled, and I was sitting by a fine-looking, grandly-dressed English- woman, and my sister was at the other side of the room talk- ing to the son of this lady. At length the young fellow came towards us. 'George,' said his mother, 'who is that you'were talking to just now?' 'Oh, that's an American girl.' 'An American girl! why, could you understand her? ' ' Oh yes, I could make out to understand her. She speaks a devil of a jargon, to be sure, but I could understand her notwith- standing.' You find no difficulty in understanding us-do you, Sir Charles?" "Oh, Miss Yadkins! not the least, I assure you. Really now, I quite comprehend everything that I hear. Aw, 'pon my honor now, I don't find the accent so bad, so-so strong,   2T2         E VER AGAINV. I mean, and the grammar-really now, the grammai is quite --I1 will say really now-quite respectable." " Ah, you flatter us," and the young lady gave him one of her most beaming smiles.   " But I believe you are right about the accent. It is not so very strong. It is not really as strong as the English accent-is it, Sir Charles ?" " English accent ! Miss Yadkins; I never heard of an English accent. You pean the cockney accent, or perhaps some of the provincial dialects, now ? " " No, I mean the true upper-class English accent." " Ah ! 'pon my word. I never heard of such a thing." " Never ! Oh, I have heard of it; and have heard it often. It's very funny to an American ear, but I suppose you get accustomed to it when you are so young that you never per- ceive it. It can be cured, I believe-can't it, Sir Charles?" " Cured ! Miss Yadkins, cured ! the English accent ! God bless me ! Never heard of such a thing ! '" " Never! why that is strange. Never heard of the red- diannel cure? Why the Marquis of Hunterround told me all about it when he was here. He said it was first tried on the Duke of Cambridge. When he was youhng Prince George, and stationed at Gibraltar years ago, he made a visit to Tan. gier, and a large party was got up to give him a day or two's boar-huntinrg. Well, all the Consulates turned out strong, and among them the American Consulate, and among tilhe Americans there was a Dr. Jimpson-a very learned man. He knew everything about languages.   I believe he' had written a grammar of the Aryan language, and a great many books that no young lady could be expected to remember the names of. Well, Prince George of Cambridge got very inti- mate with him, and one day the Prince complained to the Doctor that he had that disagreeable English accent so strong. 'Why, I can tell your Royal Highness what will cure it,' said the Doctor. The Prince begged to know what it was. 'Why, all you have to do,' said the Doctor, ' is to carry a good-sized piece of red flannel in your'mouth for six months : at the end of that time you will find yourself completely relieved.' And    ANE VER AGAIN'.        213 the Marquis says that the Prince did so; and that now he enunciates in a very pure tone, and speaks quite distinctly; but whenever he finds the accents around him too strong, and that there is danger of his relapsing, he goes right off and stuffs his mouth with a piece of red flannel for a week or so. Strange yoll never heard of itf, Sir Charles." Sir Charles puts his hand to his head with a clasping movement as if to keep his brains from gushing out upon the spot. '(The Duke of Cambridge-aw! aw! Red flannel! Bless me! H-never-never! Good Heavens!" If Sir Charles is slightly confounded, Luther is still more so. Luckily he at this moment catches sight of Helen Ledg- eral and seizes his opportunity. "You have been enjoying yourself, I hope, " said Helen, "and have been doing your duty to the young ladies to whom I presented you?" "Oh yes, I have done my best, but I don't know but that I must plead guilty to a little distraction, and perhaps negligence.' "How so?" "Why, in the first place, I have been led away into listen- ing to the conversation going on around me; and in the second place, I have been very much employed in trying to find you for a moment disengaged." "Oh, you know I am part hostess here to-night, and I have to spread myself around among the young ones as much as I can." "Oh, it is not alone the young ones, but it is the old ones as well, that have prevented my asking you if I am not to have one more dance." But why stop to detail a conversation without especial mean- ing or point, and that, even to the speakers themselves, is care- less and inconsequent? If one could photograph a couple of souls peeping out from behind consciousness, and watching each other with swift electric comprehensive glances, and gathering in, unbeknown to their owners, a thousand little IA    214        NEVER AGAIN. manifestations--the germs of sentiment which sooner or later will fructify into all the splendor of conscious passion --if one could photograph them, and a nice little vignette take the place of a ltong wordy description, it would, per- haps, be worth while to make the attempt upon the reader's sympathy. The quadrille came to an end, and Luther led his partner into the hall for a walk. By great good luck there was no clamoring for her attention. The library door stood open: what more natural than that they should wander into the room? it was quite deserted. "Miss Helen," exclaimed Luther, " do you know that it is more than two years since I came into this room with nothing hlut your friendly influence between me and starvation? And now I stand here again, and nothing but the same friendly in- fluence between me and a worse kind of starvation-a starv- ation of mind and soul. You will exert that friendly in- fluence, won't you, and-and--let me see you sometimes-once in a great while?" "Why, I will do the best I can," replied Helen ; " but it all depends upon'Aunt Shippen and mamma. You dance well, and you are so very obliging with the very young girls and the very old women, and Julia Deen says she likes you so much as a partner, that I don't know; but, however, I can't prom- ise you anything." "But you have promised me something-and that is the sonnet that Mr. Whoppers was telling me about. When and how shall I get it?" "Oh! I don't know that I promised. And it was very wrong in Mr. Whoppers to tell you that I have even tried to make verses. I just showed .him a few lines once, and he laughed -at me, and sister and mother laughed at me, and I made a vow I never would let anybody see any of my scrib. lings again. And I don't know how .it was that I let Mr. Whoppers see my sonnet: but he said he wanted to see whether I had got over the bread-and-butter phase-and I thought it pretty good, as good as many things he publishes in the Uni-   NE VER AGA IN.         2I5 verse, and so, just out of spite, I showed it to him. But I don't .k1ow about you. You are such a poet! Yet I should like to hlave your opinion. Of course, my verses don't amount to much as poetry, and the sonnet is so difficult. It is just a foolish thought I had about the sea ever trying to lift itself in vapor to the sky, and being ever drawn back in showers. But I can't send it to you, you know." The discussion continued for a few minutes, Luther press- ing the point, until Helen suddenly exclaimed, "Well, I'll tell you what-if you won't laugh at it! You promise? I'll run up-stairs and get it, and you can take it now; and as to your legend of Charlemagne, I want to see that so much- you can call here in a day or two to leave your card-it won't be expected of you,-but it will be a proper thing for you to do, and you can hand my sonnet, as well as your verses";to Joseph." "And you are not going to give it to me?" demanded Luther. "No, I am not. I am only going to show it to you, because I can't show it to anybody else." ' But if I should retain a copy?" "Oh well, if you will do such a mean thing as that, I sup- pose I must have my revenge. I will learn your poem by heart," said Helen, laughing and making a movement for the door. "And put it away with all that store of Shakespeare, and Spenser and Herbert, and Wordsworth and Tennyson, and Longfellow and Bryant," exclaimed Luther. "Oh, that would be revenge indeed. I should feel the ridicule to my finger- tips. I should never be able to hold pen again for any figures, except figures of arithmetic." Helen bounded up-stairs to her room, and in a moment was back again. An instinctive feeling led her to understand that, as it had to be done, it had better be done quickly, be- fore any loungers happened into the library, who-as she could only do it openly and before all present-might not be able to distinguish from the back of the envelope whether it   216        .NE VEIR AGAIN. contained a billet-doux or a harmless copy of verses. But in her hurry she made an awful mistake. "Come, young ones, time's up," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "Luther and myself to our dens, and you, Miss Helen, to tread alone a banquet-hall deserted-eh! I wonder how a party-giver feels when the guests have all fled, and the music is all dead-very much like going to bed, I suppose. I must give a party myself some day. If I only had a Mrs. Whop- pers to assist." "Why don't you propose to "- "Oh, Miss Helen! for you to say that! Why don't I propose? That's cruel; you know  you wouldn't ac- cept me. Good-night, good-night-permit me to say 'my dearest.' I have had a glorious time; but so short-so fleet- ing. 'But 'tis ever thus since childhood's hours.' Ah yes, how 'noiseless falls the foot of Time that only treads on flowers.'" Mr. Whoppers shook his head in a melancholy way, and pulled out his watch. "I'll take a note of time," he contin- ued, "and when found, make a note of it and get it dis- counted and proceeds put to my great account. 'The bell strikes one.' Let us see now what time of night is it, lad? But all that is very superfluous. Come, Luther, let us go." Evidently Joseph had bpened that bottle of Latour Blanche that Mr. Whoppers had talked about. "I can tell you what, young man," said Mr. Whoppers, as he bade Luther good-night, at the door of his apartment, and stood for. a few moments steadying himself against the newel-post of the stairs, "we are all born free and equal, ain't we? It's in the constitution of the United States, ain't it? Well, old Jeff was right politically-but, socially? Ah, there's the rub. We are all mere bubbles of vitality on the great ocean of force that lies all around us. That's a first- rate phrase, ain't it? But, socially, some of us are a devilish sight bigger bubbles than others, eh? And now go to bed and dream of the silver sea, and let the sound of its surges be the requiem of any vagarious stuff in your noddle. Bah! I'm   VNE'VER AGAIN.         27 getting poetical. It's all that Berichon; Liqueur digestive! I thought I'd try one pe/it verre as a finale, but it's so confounded strong, I'll no more of it. But, Luther, hold on one min- ute; what I want to get at is this: that you need never expect to be invited to that house again." "Why not?" demanded Luther. "Because-because you're ' too good-looking, and you can't come in ;' you're too-too-comme ilfaut, as we say in Paris. Yes, yes," continued Mr. Whoppers, as Luther tore himself away and mounted the stairs, " you are too d-d comme ilfaut to be left around loose in our set; we can't stand it, we- can't, I could see it in my lady's eye. Think of the silver sea, my lad; verbum sat. Good-night, good-night, my dearest; I hear the watchman's cry; no I don't, it's just that Berichon buzzing in my head." Luther hurried up to his room, and lighting his lamp, sat down to examine his prize. He however hesitated for some moments before taking the lines from their envelope. They were almost too precious to look at-and-ah! there was the. fear, which he would not confess to himself, that they might not be quite worthy of their maker; not quite up to his own stand- ard. Of course, as Helen had said, they couldn't amount to much as poetry, and the sonnet is so very difficult, but what if it should be flat and silly? Impossible! It might be weak and feeble, and commonplace and badly constructed: that was but a reasonable expectation of any young girl's first attempt in a form of verse that had tasked the powers of the greatest poets; but downright silly the lines could not be. But; what if they were? would they be any the less precious? Luther opened the envelope. "Why, what is this? A sonnet? No! a long poem that far transcends the conven- tional number of lines. She must have made a mistake." These verses could not have been intended for his sight. It would be very improper-very indelicate to read them with- out permission!-but-but-human nature is very weak, and we will peep over Luther's shoulder as his eye'runs down the page: 10   2 8         NE VER AGA IN. When with dainty hand the master Deftly strikes the sounding strings, And the witching flood of music O'er the heart its glamour flings,- List'ning closely, low harmonics Undertone the music's roll, Faintly speaking to the senses, Whispering louder to the soul. So when glows the land at noon-tide, And the God showers down his gold, Or when Eve distils her amber, And Night's spangled gates unfold, Or when wreaths of protean cloudage Whirl the face of Heaven along; Or the leaflet struck by Zephyr Sighing sings its saddening song; Or, enthralled in dread and wonder, Wandering by the wave-lashed shore, Mine eyes all filled with wild commotion And mine ears with ravening roar,- Then, as always 'neath Earth's chantings, Low harmonic tones I hear,- Tones mysterious-from the Far-off, But that ever seem so near. And as 'neath the chants of Nature, So beneath the smiles of Art, Speak the same low countertonings       K To my sad and questioning heart. Speak, 'twould seem, of deeper meanings Than the sounds that round me fall, Speak of states of finer being Whence in seeming comes the call. Expound me, then, these mystic voicings, Tell me what they fain would say; I am young, the world I know not, Tell me, tell me, then, I pray. Say, has Life here nothing finer Than what now I feel and see? Hush! my rebel heart-be quiet! Surely that can never be.   NE VER AGAIN.          219 Surely Life has something finer Than the sweetest songs of Art, Than the chaunts and charms of Nature, For my sad and questioning heart. Surely-but, ah me, I tremble Lest that finer thing should be, What all around me call delusion, Love's transcendent ecstasy. It was with something approaching a transcendent ecstasy that Luther jumped into bed, just as Dawn was about to swing Night's spangled gates into place. It is needless to say that if he entertained any hopes of an hour or two's sleep he was disappointed. He little thought, however, that Helen was equally wakeful: and those miserable lines the cause, in her case too, as well! The poor innocent sonnet lying quietly in its place on her writing-table had been pettishy torn in pieces and flung on the floor. It was really too provoking! and the more so as the young man must now be treated with a little more coolness and reserve, if there should ever be a meeting again, unless--unless-well unless sge could get Mr. Whop- pers to explain how it happened. Luther's thoughts ran upon his legend of Charlemagne, which he was to give in exchange. It seemed all too poor: but-a happy thought!-he would illustrate it. He had, as we have said, quite a talent for drawing, and he would endeav- or to make up with his pencil for the feebleness of his pen. That would give it some point, or at least add emphasis to the real point. There might not be much poetry in his poem, or cleverness in his rendering .of the old story, but there was a good plain moral, and very applicable-that is, supposing Charlemagne to be a great New York commission merchant and Engenhard a young man in a store down town. That was a good idea, and during the day more than one sheet of note-paper on his desk at Burling Slip suffered in con- sequence, but as the evening came on he recovered himself sufficiently to think of his engagement with Madame Steignitz, and to resolve that no balls or parties should ever again inter- fere with his studies. At the appointed hour he set out for   220        NAtVE'R A GA IA Wooster Street, and mounted the rickety stairs leading to her apartment. "And so you broke your engagement with me to go to a party," exclaimed Madame Steignitz, as Luther was making his excuses. "Well, well, I will not reproach you; you are young: 'tis the way of the young. Why should you mind to visit a poor old woman when les beaux yeux, les mains douces, les lumieres, la musiyue, the soft frou-frou of muslin and silk et tout He parfium de la jeunesse doree invite you? ah, I know. Once I, too, thought the dance to be Heaven." "Indeed, you mistake," exclaimed Luther, " and I don't think it will happen again. I had a particular reason for going this time-one which rendered it impossible for me to refuse." "Oh, oh, I comprehend!  II y avait quelqu'une avec laquelle vous Ctes aux petits soins--who is she?" "No no," exclaimed Luther. "I had to go. because the invitation was from my employer," and Luther had the grace to blush at the fib. "And who is he?" she demanded. "Mr. Ledgeral." "Oh, Mr. Ledgeral, the rich merchant of Burling Slip. Why did you not tell me his name before?" "Tell you! Why should I? do you know him?" "Dame! I don't know ; perhaps I do," and Madame Steignitz mused for a moment in silence. "And now comrn- mzenons, we shall begin. We must not lose any time. You think you can come to me only three times a week? Well, you will give me three hours each evening, and you will see what I shall do for you. You know what is the greatest thing for to learn a new language? No? Well, I shall tell you. Study! Study! Study! I speak five languages perfectly; how do I arrive to that? By looking at a book one hour a day-? No, by study, pen in hand, four, five, six, eight hours some days. Some years ago I have teach the French, in this country. My pupils study one hour, two hour -some days, and some days nothing at all. And then they say, Oh, mon   NE VER A GACI.,        221 Dieu! quel talent incroyable have those Germans, and Rus- sians, and Poles for the languages! Bah! it is not so! Its is not the difference in the brains, or in the organ, or in the method: it is in the work. The Russians, and Poles, and Germans, in the matter of languages, have a grand talent for work. I gave some French lessons in Germany once, and one pupil, la veuve d'un nouv7eau rich/e, would to learn French quickly. So she read, she write, she spe-ak fourteen hours every day for a year. She went into the French, grosse comm e fa, et rouge comme un bifteak; et lourde--e double de mc,i, and she came out of it mince comme ;a, et blanche comme une assfette de solpe d la reine, but she knew more French than the whole academy. So we will study; coammena;ons, let us see what you know. Read this page of Balzac. I will see how you pro- nounce: then you shall write some phrase which I will dic- tate, and I will see how muchgrammar you know. Don't mind me, je vais fazire ma petite cuisine. yee n'ai pas encore solpe; allez donzc,--ne me regardiez pas, vous ne me derangez pas." Luther commenced reading. Madame Steignitz occupied herself with preparations for her exceedingly frugal meal. A casserole, with its stock of meagre soup, was pulled out from the recesses of an old, and neatly carved, but dilapidated bujfet, that m'ght, perhaps, in former times have contained the delicate Sevres of a Ninon's petites souPe's, or upheld the plate and crystal at the orgies of the Regent. Madame uncovered the casserole, and took a sniff at the contents. "Open your mouth wider and sound your r-rs, and recol- lect one thing; you can't swallow your letters in French as you do in English." Another sniff at the casserole, and then as if satisfied that the contents still remained in an edible condition, the vessel was placed to heat upon the top of the little anthracite stove. "Bon!/ Bon/" she exclaimed, "I see you have practice with your u and your double i, but your r-ah, you must r-r-r-oll it more. Like this : sacr-r-r-r-r," and the old woman's   2 222        NE VER A GA IN. head disappeared in the recesses of the buffet; whence the r-rs continued to roll out, accompanied by divers profanities and a great clattering and clinking and rustling of bottles and plates and old boxes and baskets. "Sacr-r-r-e tonnere! 7'ai perdu mon ognon; sarr-r-r norm de Dieu! mon seui ognon. Oui, oui mon seulognon. OA est il? ol est il? o peut-il se trouver? Ah! ah! le void! sacr-r-r-r cochon d'ognon, le voici." Luther paused, and for a moment almost imagined that the old buffet was about to give birth to a French trooper. The old woman emerged with triumphant vivacity, holding another stewpan in one hand, and in the other a cold boiled potato; a coffee-cup filled with fish livers and hearts; and the truant onion. She proceeded to slice the potato into the casserole; then the half of the onion; adding a pinch of salt and pepper, a few crumbs of bread and a lump of fat, and was just going to turn in the contents of the coffee-cup, when she paused, ad- vanced to ILuther, held the cup under his nose, and asked him in French what he called it. Luther shook his head. "Oh, you don't know? Well, I will tell you; it is a sample and a proof of 'the prodigality and barbarity of your country. That is one of the dearest dishes in the French market. In Paris I give two francs a pound, and make a dish for the gournet le plus instruit of Phillips, or the Cafe Anglais, and here, sometimes I give three cents a pound, and sometimes I get them for nothing. Mais lisez encore; ne me regardez pas. ye vais faire un plat d'entrailles de poisson saute d la grande Caroeme." L - Luther resumed his reading, while the old lady stirred the contents of her stewpans, and prepared one corner of the rickety old table, A soup-plate of French porcelain, with broken edges, a battered silver spoon, and a napkin of fine material but frayed and full of holes, and looking somewhat the worse in color from frequent general service as duster and dishcloth, were soon arranged, and a portion of the contents   NVE eT'R A GAIN.        223 of the first stew having been emptied into the soup-plate, the old lady commenced her meal. "That will do for the reading," she exclaimed, after a few mouthfuls of soup, "I see that, with 'a little practice, you will pronounce very well; you have a-good organ. Now, will you take your pencil and paper, and I shall see what you can write." "Mais pardon un moment," she exclaimed, as Luther got his pencil and paper in readiness ;--" ilfautfaire sauter vmes en- trailles depoisson," and jumping up she rushed to the stove, gave the stewpan a shake, whisked back again to the table, and swallowed a few mouthfuls of soup. "Maintenant commenfons, --write as I dictate. Ecrivez donr-I am sorry that I cannot ask you to eat something." "2Manger quelqze chose," said Luther, finishing the phrase. "I cannot do so for several reasons."      ' "Plusieures raisons," echoed Luther. "First, because I have not got any too much for myself." "Pour moi," murmured Luther. "Second, because what I, a poor woman, have to 'eat is not good enough for a young gentleman." "Gentilhomme," said Luther. "Third, because I know that you have already eaten your' supper, and that you are not hungry." "N'avez pas faim." The stewpan on the stove began to emit by this time cer- tain fragrant evidences of readiness for the table. Madame Steignitz, first dexterously giving it a few shakes, whipped it off the stove, and poured its contents into the same plate that had served for the soup, all the time continuing her dictation0 "Good I " she exclaimed, as she swallowed the last mouth- ful and wiped the plate with a crust of bread. "Good! now let me see what you have written. Very good, indeed! I see you have made some progress. The worst part for you is over. You have not made more than a dozen errors. Wait till I put away these things, and then we will find them and correct them. Et aprcs nous causerons un peu-what you call chat a little."   2 2 4       NE VER A GAI Nr. The remainder'of the evening was filled up with talk upon various subjects; with a scene from 'Moli6re, read by Madame with spirit and vivacity; and with an extemporized represen. tation of assumed characters in various situations. "Now, you shall imagine yourself to be a young lady, and I will be a gentleman come to visit you." And the old lady rushed to the door and pretended to enter the room, sliding, and bowing, and making her compliments with affected em- pressement. Luther could hardly refrain from a hearty laugh, but forcing himself into the spirit of the scene, he endeavored to reply with all the vigor and vivacity possible. Madame Steignitz neither helped him nor corrected him directly, but whenever he made a mistake, or was in want of a word or a phrase, she said something that involved the phrase, or furnished the expression, and that with an emphasis that drove in and clinched the right word or the right idiom, in a way that dawdling over a grammar or phrase-book could- never do. "Now you shall be the gentleman, and I will be the lady. You shall say to me all that I have said to you." And again the scene was repeated. "Now I shall keep a book-store, and you have come to buy some books." And the probable conversation of buyer and seller was gone through with. There was a little old French clock, surmounted by a pair of tarnished gilt Cupids on the stained wooden mantle- piece, half hidden by piles of papers, pamphlets, bottles, pill- boxes, brushes, and odds and ends of all kinds of rubbish. Its tiny voice announced to Luther's astonished ear the hour of ten. He could hardly believe it was so late, so much had he been interested in the exercises-of the evening. As he bade Madame Steignitz adieu, with many thanks and the strongest protestations of his determination to renew his visits upon the appointed days, and closed the door be- hind him, he felt a wonderful elation at the opening prospect of a complete mastership of a second tongue. He was cer-   INV VER AGAIN.        225 tain now of French. German, which he was to begin in a month's time, he would do his best at, and might even ulti- mately attempt the Italian and Spanish, but French at the worst was within his grasp; a short and vigorous attack must result in a perfect and permanent conquest. As Luther closed the door, and stepped out on the landing, he noticed a light issuing from the room of-Mr. Planly. The door was a little ajar, and he felt an impulse to push it open, and exchange passing salutations with the old inventor, when he was interrupted by a ..ound of voices from within. ' How much money swill it take to complete it? ') demanded a harsh voice, in suppressed tone, with a strong foreign accent. "I am poor-desperately poor, but once finished and in my hands, if it will do what you think, and I hope, I can get plenty of money for it. I How much money will it take to com- plete it?" "I cannot say," responded Mr. Planly, " not much; but I must have tools and materials, and you will recollect that it is an affair of time as well as money. I must experiment- try different plans,.-make and remake the thing so as to have it portable as well as efficient; And, in the meantime, I must live: I can't go every day as I have to-day without eating. My landlady is impatient for her rent; some money I must have, and I cannot beg, borrow, or steal." "And this landlady of yours, blas she any money?" "The y say that she is very rich: she must be, I should think, quite wealthy; she spends nothing and owns several houses."                 / "And where does she keep her money? Does she have s any here-in her garret-do you suppose?" If Luther had been in the room he would have seen Mr. Planly suddenly start and fasten a keen and suspicious look upon his companion. "Ah, I know your thoughts': you think that I wish to rob her," resumed the strange voice, " but if I did there wobld be no great harm in it. The money would do more good in my hands than in the pockets of a miserable old avar}e like that." I    226         NEVER AGA IN. "'There is no necessity to discuss that point," rejoined Mr. Planly. "The attempt would be a folly at least, as she never trusts herself with a penny, and every day she deposits before night in the savings bank the noney that she collects." "In that case she is doubly safe from me," replied the stranger with a laugh. "Desperate poverty has never yet made mie coimmit a crime. I am sure it will never cause me to knowingly make such a fool of myself. In my coulitry an old witch like that would be pretty sure to have a good nla&ot somewhere, and I know some of my co-mpatriots who would be looking after it. But your confounded banks of deposit are so thick that they spoil that game. But I mlust bid you good-night, I have an appointment with my friends at our usual haunt in Wooster Street at ten. I will see if we can't raise a few dollars for you. Au rezoir." The last word reminded Luther that he was listening to a conver3ation not intended for his ear, and decided his hesita- tion about entering. He concluded to defer his call upon Mr. Planly until another evening, and turned to the stairs, just in time to escape observation, as the door was flung open and gave exit to a small bushy-wiskered man in a cloak and- slouched hat. "IMind you keep it well out of sight," he called back frolm the head of the stairs to the inventor, who stood in the door- way. "The slightest publicity will destroy the value of the whole thing." "Oh, never fear," replied M[r. Planly; '"I have very few visitors, and I don't know a soul in town who would willingly take the slightest interest in that or anything else that I am concerned in, or who would pay attention enough to anything I could say to enable thenm to comprehend either its princi: ples or its objects." "Dame! Je n'en suis pas si su;r," muttered the man in the cloak, but with an accent which, contrasting with the pure intonation of Madame Steignitz still ringing in his ears, left Luther very much in doubt as to whether the speaker was a Frenchman or not.   NE VER A GAIN.        227 "I am not so sure of that. There are a great many cu- rious people about; so be on your guard." The speaker rapidly descended the stairs. Luther's curiosity was aroused. He was half inclinedl to stop and examine the stranger a little more closely, but he did not like to be caught watching or waiting; and he did not like to admit to himself a capability of trying to pry into the business of other people with which he had nothing to do. He opened the front door without looking directly back, closely followed by the stranger, and tripping down the steps, turned up the street. In front of the steps, leaning against the railing, was a large, powerfully-built man; roughly clad, as Luther, aided by the feeble glimmer of a miserable gas-light at a little distance, could see at a glance. A small astrachan cap, set upon a monstrous mass of curly jet-black hair surmounted his head. Around his neck was a red bandanna, knotted sailor-fashion, with the ends falling down upon an old cardigan jacket that was buttoned up to the chin. A heavy black moustache and beard, that covered nearly one-half-of a hideously repulsive face, deeply scarred with the small-pox, together with rather large gold rings in his ears, constituted all the details that Luther's rapid glance could take in; and these he could hardly be said to see at the instant. They became developed in his consciousness only by a mental analysis that lasted until he had almost reached his home in Bleecker Street. As a part too of this development into cog-* nizable mental pictures of instantaneous and simultaneous sen- suous impressions, he arrived at the conclusion that the two men were friends; that they had nodded to each other; had dropped a word of salutation, which was neither French nor English ; and had gone off together down Wooster Street in the direction of Canal Street. 9, Perhaps his impression was'somewhat intensified by their sudden disappearance-as he stood looking after them; one moment they were plain in sight, the next they had vanished. --"Dropped into some under-ground drinking-saloon," said   2260     A, IVI 1f   iJt Al/V. Luther, but his curiosity had never been so thoroughly piqued before; and yet, as he said to himself, he could not imagine why or wherefore. There was nothing very striking or won- derful in the fact that the inventor had a visitor with a foreign  accent, or that the said foreigner had a companion who was waiting for him outside of the house; still he could not help wondering about it as he made his way up-stairs to his little  attic, and he could not help wondering at himself for wonder- /- ing at so trivial an incident. "I dare say," mused Luther, "if I should stroll the streets to-night until the short hours, I should see and hear a dozen things much more curious, and  much more suggestive of mystery. There's the old woman-- she is a complete mystery-and how impenetrable! How thoroughly dry she has pumped me, and how little she has revealed in return! But then, I suppose, that is natural. I have nothing to conceal; she evidently has had her adventures and her trials. She must have had a son, I take it, and she fancies that I resemble him. I suppose she will tell me all about it some time." Luther went off to sleep, and had a troubled dream of Asmodeus and unroofed houses; of mysterious sights and sounds; of interesting scenes of intrigue and conjugal infe- licity; and debauchery and murder; and splendid tableaux- vivants of love, and hate, and greed. Beautiful, isn't it?" exclaimed the limping devil in Lu- ther's ear, as he tore off roof after roof; "but here is a couple of pictures not quite so striking, but really the finest of all." And the devil ripped up a roof, and exposed to Luther's sight a luxurious chamber with a single occupant-a maiden, beau- tiful and youthful, but with a distressed and despairing expres- sion that foreshadowed, for the instant, the permanent lines and shadows of thirty. With her hair half in crimping-pins, and half straggling loose; and her cheek hollow and wan, and-now that the slight tint of the red ribbon, with which it had been artistically touched, had been washed off-almost as white as the folds of her robe de nuit, she sat at her dressing- table motionless ; holding her head on one hand, and gazing      NE VER AGA IN.         229 at a riviere of diamonds that flashed its seductive light from the perfumed satin folds of its richly gilt and embossed case. She started, closed the lid, and with a slight shudder pushed the box from her. Her hand fell upon a small gilt- edged prayer-book; it opened at the marriage service ; she hastily closed it with a still stronger shudder, and flung it, with a gesture of fierce impatience, on to a distant sofa. Tears sprang to her eyes, and rolled down her cheeks; she clasped her hands with a convulsive grasp, and bowed her head upon them. Deep sobs shook her whole frame; a wail of agony burst from her laboring heart. "Too late, too late," she cried. "Oh, Harry, Harry, my love! my life! why did you let me give you up? why did I do it, why did I do it? Why did that horrible fellow with his million cross my path? Alas! how full of misery looms my future. Oh that I could die! yes, die to-night; now-at once, and escape forever."    * She raised her head, wiped the tears from her eyes, and commenced coiling her back twist, and finishing her front hair with crimping-pins. "Now that is the kind of thing I like to see," said Asmo- deus. "There is a young girl-one of the most fashionable and best educated of any within two blocks of the Avenue--but her family by some miserable dispensation of fortune is not rich. Her mother has only a pittance-some seven or eight thousand a year ; and her father doesn't get a cent over twelve thousand as president of an insurance company. She must have money, and her charms have been in the market for two years past. In that time she has fallen desperately in love with a nice young fellow of a doctor, who is rapidly getting. into good practice, but who has no income that would permit for nlany years anything like a life of fashion. Why a single ball at Dellnonico's, when you pay a thousand dollars for rose- buds, to say nothing of the other flowers, would swallow up the feds of fifty amputations, or accouchements; or exhaust the pecuniary supplies derivable from twenty malingering maternal- nervous systems, or a dozen infantile fits, rickets, and club-feet, or a score or two of paternal gouty stomachs !      -   230        iE VEE AGAIN. and congested livers. No, she couldn't marry the doctor, and settle down to a life of love and domestic bliss, or mingled duty and rational pleasure,-to the hum-drum enjoyments of a stupid family circle, and a restricted social set. Think of what she would have to endure: the barest glance of recog- nition from Mrs. Newcome, the banker's wife; the cut-direct of Mrs. Wriggleton and her daughters, or the cold hard stare of Mrs. D'Oberge. No, she couldn't marry the doctor; Pa and Ma both said so, and society said so,-so she is going to marry an ugly, illiterate, unrefined, flashy, flippant boor of twice her age, who, because he has converted an inherited fifty thousand, picked up by his progenitor in a feed-store, into two millions by questionable speculation, imagines him- self to be the equal of the finest-cultured and most tendei and delicate-mannered gentlemen in the land. Does she ever thnk of bearing children to such a father, and rearing them under his parental guidance and example? You need not ask. Look at that shudder that runs through every nerve in her body. "But enough of this. Here we have a funny picture. Let us look at it for an instant. Do you see that old woman?- that is old Mother Jinks. She is going to aball. She always is going to a ball, or party, or reception, or somewhere, where she can show off her laces and diamonds, her false teeth and painted cheeks, and scraggy bust. She has no daughter to bring out, but she contrives to hang herself on to some young damsel, for the time being, by the pure power of suction. Like a vampire she fastens upon her victim; lulls her to sleep with fannings and flutterings of compliments and little attentions, sucks out all her youthful social juices, and throws her, a withered and helpless old maid, away. Look at her now: she is almost made up, and she will be soon simpering and bowing, and grimacing, and boring herself and others, and making herself an object of ridicule and contempt to the young people around her, and denouncing the party and so- ciety generally, and sneering at'common people,' and won- dering why she cannot enjoy herself, forgetting that no one   NVEVER AGAIN.         23  can find anything in society when they take nothing into it themselves. Then she will come home, quarrel with her maid, and go to bed, and get up again to go through the same routine the next day. I declare it makes me laugh," and the devil gave a loud ha! ha! that startled Luther from his sleep. He was glad to find it daylight and time to rise if he wished to give a few finishing touches to the illustrations of his "Legend" before the summons to hash and buckwheat cakes. "I tell you what, Mr. Editor," said Luther to Mr. Whop- pers, at the breakfast-table, "if I could write it all out it would make a first-rate article for the Atlantic or the Galaxy; it would be altogether above the line of your readers." "No doubt, too lofty entirely-but that is natural: a fel- low that has been straddling ridge-poles and climbing round chimney-pots all night, might be expected to be a little ele- vated. Are you sure the elevation did not take place before you went to bed? You thought that it was a spirit that was leading you around. Well, perhaps it was, and infernally bad spirit too. There is a good deal of it about. It is powerful enough, no doubt. I've known it to take the roof right off of a man's head; and as to elevation, a single gin-sling will sometimes throw a fellow as high as Trinity steeple. One thing I can tell you, and that is, your diable boiteux is a little too much like a police reporter; or the city correspondent of a country newspaper; or a third-class novelist. He gives you exceptional views, and makes you think that what he sees and says stands for the world and society. There are thou- sands of houses in New York upper-tendom whose roofs he wouldn't dare to disturb: the amount of sensation to be ex- tracted from them wouldti't pay for the trouble of ripping up a single tile." !s -I   CHAPTER XII. Inflation and Panic-A Tight Money-Market-The Great House in Trouble-Mr. Ledgeral Raises The Money-A Nice Distinction-. Count Isenthal's Letter-Joseph's Recollections.-The Great House Saved. pTHERE   had been one of those periods, lasting two or three years, of great financial inflation and consequent commercial activity. Money was plenty, and every kind of trade acknowledged the impulse. And not only all kinds of legitimate trade, but the absurdest schemes, the wildest spec- ulations, the most brazen swindles floated, bobbing and bub- bling about, on the great seethDing, roaring current of credit. In the "street," there was a terrible activity, and all the avenues to sudden wealth were filled with crowds of eager, excited men anxiously making haste to be rich. A perfect fury of greed had seized upon all classes, professions and trades; upon all ages and both sexes.  The preacher's thoughts wandered at the sacred desk to his last investment in the "Communipaw Silver Lead," or the "Chickahomanv Railroad and Labor Improvement Co." The great surgeon hurried the sweep of his amputating-knife by ten seconds, to attend a meeting of a board of directors squatting upon spec- imens of a new-found vein of the real stuff in the wilds of the Rocky Mountains.  The great barrister in his heaviest speeches could not keep from mentally counting his chances in the Big Thing Petroleum, and even, in one of his highest flights, apostrophizing the Fount of Justice as flowing at least four hundred barrels. The glowing appeal moves the court. The presiding judge starts, leans forward, and whispers: "Is there any chance for the court to get in on first principles " I v " -.I             swe-- -- .4 .   NEVER AGAIN.233 "One five-thousand-dollar share left-genuine, first sand- stone, no watering, no doubling-up. Your honor will step right in on the very first rung of the derrick ladder." "Good! The court notes the point, aid will reserve its decision until the afternoon. Go on with your argument, sir." And now had begun the inevitable reaction. Money had become tight, or if not tight, could not be found lying around so loose as usual. There were many symptons of a coming hur- ricane. The stock-barometers fell away below foul. There was a leaden dulness settling down in the street, and the faces of bank presidents and cashiers grew cloudy: there was a growing disposition to " realize," to " pocket the rocks," to "git out," to "take in sail," to "clew up and clew down," and many a captain of a gallant craft regretted that he had not carried his top-gallant sails over reefed top-sails, so that he could shorten his canvas handily in the squall. You had but to visit the Rialto in the time of high-tide, or in other words to drop into the note and exchange brokers' of- fices in Wall Street, to find that no firm stood higher in the opin- ion of money-lenders than the old respected and respectable establishment of Shippen, Ledgeral & Co. And yet it was difficult for Mr. Gainsby to raise all the money needed. It would never do, however, for such a solid firm to acknowledge any pressing want. It would never do for such a respectable firm to go shinning about for temporary loans. It would never do for a firm composed of individuals of such large pri- vate wealth to attempt discounts from outside commercial Grad-grinds on questionable collaterals, or allow their own notes to be shaved at a higher rate than ten per cent. The very purity and elevation of the firm's character worked against it now. As when a fast girl, with a reputation for modesty and propriety, un peau usee, says and does things without losing social consideration that would completely destroy the char- acter of an immaculate, but slow virgin; or as when a mere member of the congregation reels home from the St. Nicholas dinner, and hurts nothing or nobody, while a single lurch in   234        NEVER AGAIN. a communicant will shock a whole church; so a firm like Ship- pen, Ledgeral & Co. was debarred from any acknowledgment, by outward sign or symptom, of the fury of the blast. No willow-like bending, no shivering, no shaking. In the daily "Ho! what news from the Rialt?" its name must not he mentioned. A single whisper against the solidity of such a settled institution, the faintest suggestion of frangibility in such a towering structure, would precipitate everything and everybody " down town" into one universal and never-ending smash. And yet the firm wanted money, and didn't know how or where to raise it; or rather they had raised so much that it might look suspicious to call for more; and, besides, the se- curities on which a great deal of its money was locked up would hardly bear examination even in the best of times. "If it weren't for our advances to those d d Cuban sugar fellows, we should do well enough," exclaimed Mr. Gainsby, as he and lMr. Ledgeral sat in anxious consultation in the library of the house in Washington Square. Mr. Gainsby had called at an early hour before breakfast to see his senior partner, and to try and arrange some plan of operations before going down town, and found that, like himself, Mr. Ledgeral had passed a sleepless night, and was up and dressed an hour before his usual time. Mr. Gainsby considered himself a harassed man,-and for the time a thoroughly overworked and used-up man-but if he could have seen his partner pacing his chamber during the silent watches of the night, he would have thanked heaven for his own occasional snatches of sleep, and still more in that his own watchfulness was caused by nothing more than business anxiety, and that no pangs of conscience, or fear of disgrace, sharpened the dread of a protested note. "If it weren't for those advances," said Mr. Gainsby, pointing with his finger to some items in a'schedule which lay on the table before him. "Well, whose fault is that " said Mr. Ledgeral. I had nothing to do with it."   VNEVER A GAIN.         35 "You forget," replied Mr. Gainsby ; "it is true I propos4 it, but you approved it, and I suppose the responsibility is shared about equally: if we hadn't done it, three of the larg- est plantations on the island would have slipped out of our hands." "Well, well," testily replied Mr. Ledgeral, "it is done now-the money is gone, and we shan't see a cent of it back again for six months, at least. What is the lowestfigure that will tide us over into next month?" "We must have a full hundred and fifty thousand," an- swered Mr. Gainsby, and two-thirds of that must go into the bank to-day. When I got those sugar-house notes for fifty thousand discounted yesterday, I saw that it strained our friends at the bank somewhat, and that we need not look for more in that quarter. I know of but one resource." "And what may that be?" demanded Mr. Hedgeral. "We must go to Mr. Shippen," replied Mr. Gainsby. "Never, never! No, no, that will never do," exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral, starting from his seat and beginning to pace up and down the room. Startled at his sudden vehemence, Mr. Gainsby watched his partner for a few minutes in silent astonishment. A sus- picion suddenly dawned upon his mind that Mr. Ledgeral had already been dipping on his own. account into the purse of the special partner. He had had reason to know that Mr. Ledgeral's private speculations had been on the most enormous scale, and it was pretty certain that many of them must have been unsuccessful. "Pity," thought Mr. Gainsby, "that the restrictions in the articles of copartnership should apply only to the junior members of the firm, and that the head of the house had not been saved from the temptations of the times also." "  No, no, I can't do that; I don't want to bother Uncle Shippen about any business matters at present. Besides, I know he has no money; he has little or nothing but real es- tate, and if he were disposed to mortgage the whole of it, that would do us no good at the moment." -c            x I...-.' ...... .I-    236        NE VER AGAIN. "What is to be done then?"' demanded Mr. Gainsby, with a quivering lip. "Suspension now, would be perfect ruin. We may as well make up our minds to go under com- pletelry." His partner seemed lost in thought, and made ro rep'y for several minutes. "It must be done," suddenly muttered Mr. Ledgeral, starting up from his chair. "There is no help for it; worse than ruin--open disgrace if I hesitate. I have made the plunge--I must wade through. My only possible chance is in saving the firm. That all right, I can turn myself around, by spring, before the fellow arrives, and get-out of the scrape without dishonor."' Mr. Gainsby listened intently, but could make' nothing of the few words that caught his ear; while Mr. Ledgeral continued his walk up and down, in a state of marked agita- tion and excitement. Drops of cold perspiration started fronom his forehead. 'The color forsook his cheek, and his lips, parched and trembling, seemed scarce able to frame his in- coherent sentences. Suddenly he seemed to become sensible that some one else was in the room, and throwing himself into a chair opposite to Mr. Gainsby, he demandee, with an effort at vigor, but in a voice still trembling, if Mr. Gainsby was positively certain that one hundred thousand would be enough for the day. Mr. Gainsby pointed to the schedule. "Well, then," resumed Mr. Ledgeral, "I think I can an- swer for it-yes, I will answer for it. I will be down before twelve."  "With the money?" "Yes, with the money. I shall have to make great sacri fices to get it; and I shall charge the firm with any loss upon my securities." Ir. Gainsby nodded his head, and took up his hat I "I hope there is no chance of any mistake or miscarriage," he said hesitatingly. "If there is, I am sure our special will never forgive us for not letting him know."   NE VER A GAIIN.         237 "Never fear, I will be on hand at twelve; and you need say nothing to any one, mind to any one, as to where the money comes from." Mr. Gainsby took his departure, and a close observer might have noticed that he left the house and strode off down Broadway with a more elastic step than usual, and with a pleasant smile and a hand ready to wave an exceedingly com- placent salute to every passing acquaintance. Mr. Gainsby was a precise, fastidious man socially, and had never in his whole life indulged in the vulgarity, or rather the downright blackguardism of smoking in the street, and he was not a little startled at finding his cigar case in his hand. - "I must indulge," said he to himself. "It is early yet, and my nerves have been so tightly strained that, now the tension is off, they jingle and jangle like fiddle-strings. He'll get the money no doubt. He seemed to be confident of success. I wonder where it will come from. Ha! ha! that was a very useless injunction not to tell anybody-I'll be hanged, if I know anything to tell. I know that he has been desperately short for a month past, and I am pretty sure he has already got into Uncle Shippen, so how or where he can raise a hun- dred thousand to-day, I don't know?" Mr. Ledgeral sat in his luxurious arm-chair for at least half an hour after Mr. Gainsby had left, without moving. No longer a picture of mercantile dignity, and condescending, ele- gant dilettanteism; but rather a picture of brooding irresolu- tion and forlorn conscience-stricken imbecility. The summons to breakfast remained unanswered. Joseph put his head into the room for the second time, and received an impatient re. buff, ending with an order to bring a cup of coffee into the library. "'Pears to me," muttered Joseph, "dat someting's gwine to happen bout dese ere days. I heard 'em say dat dey had got de screws on, and dat money is as tight as a clam-shell. Yes tighter dan a clam-shell. 'Pears to dis nigger dat some- ting is gwine to happen." Mr. Ledgeral sipped his coffee quietly for a few moments,   238          NE VER AG Mr. and then proceeded to draw from the recesses of his portfolio a letter with a German post-mark, but the contents were written in very correct English.  It was dated "Isenthal," and con- tained an enclosure in the shape of a bill of exchange. Omit. ting some remarks upon the weather, the harvests, and the prospects of war, the letter ran nearly as follows: "Yours of the I3th ult. has been duly received, and its contents thank. fully noted. I am much obliged to you for your advice, as to the Illinois Centrals. They are confident in Frankfort, I am told, of an advance, but you are so much nearer the ground, and I have so much confidence in the judgment of a man who is at the head of so world-renowned a house as yours, that I think it best to make the change you propose. You will consider yourself, therefore, hereby authorized to make the exchange. En. closed please find a first bill on Barings drawn to my order and endorsed to you for ten thousand pounds, the proceeds of which please invest as you have suggested: half in your city six per cents, and half in the stock of some sound bank. As I have more money than I need at present, I shall not draw upon you for my coming dividends on the bonds in your hands. You can hold the money until I come out, which I hope to do early in the. Spring. I have long had a desire to see your great and much- to-be-envied country, and one of the pleasures I count most upon is that of expressing my obligations to a man so distinguished and widely hon- ored as yourself. Permit me to say that, as a young man entirely igno- rant of business and business men, had it not been that I was attracted oy your high reputation, and by a little incident which I will explain to you when I have the pleasure of seeing you, the money you have so hap- pily invested for me would have been most probably squandered. "Hoping that this will find you in good health, "I am yours truly, "Count Albert von Isenthal." "Fool that I am!" exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral.   "Why did I write such a pressing invitation to visit this country? If I had not put it into his head he never would have thought of coming.   D  d, miserable vanity!   Just to have  the pleasure and eclat of parading about a rich young German count, I have got myself into this scrape." And for a moment Mr. Ledgeral took refuge from the black and repulsive aspect of crime in the contemplation and fierce reprobation of minor foibles and weaknesses. But not for long could he discharge   NE VER AGAIN.          239 his mind of the fact that he had yielded to temptation, and in an evil hour had fallen from his honorable and virtuous es- tate down-down to the ranks of the criminal class. No, no. not quite so bad as that; because from the first, and still more now, he was resolved upon restitution with interest at the highest market rate, not perhaps in money, but in the best of advice and business guidance. In this light At was only borrowing, and as it was absolutely essential ll:at the money should be had at the moment, there was of course no time to write to the young man, asking the loan. And after all, it was only a portion of the fund that had been used, only a hundred thousand; a mere bagatelle. "If that dry hole that those rascals ran the oil into had really proved an eighty-barrel well, and petroleum had kept up to eight dollars, it would have paid the whole in less than six months. Now there is, with this bill of exchange, just one hundred and fifty thousand left: we must have a hundred thousand to day. Necessity knows no law; the very exist- ence of one of the most important institutions in the United States depends upon it. One must make sacrifices sometimes for the good of our fellow-men. Besides, the money is not 'to be wasted or thrown away; it will all come back again. And more than all, the trust has been violated, if you will use a rough term, and part of' the money disposed of,- and that too in what the public might call wild speculations. It can't certainly be any great harm to go on a little further and borrow in a really good sound cause the remainder." The distinction that Mr. Ledgeral was drawing in his mind, although very fine, will be equally apparent to the reader. If the trust had been intact there might be some question about touching it. But it had been broken into. The thing had been done-the responsibility had been in- curred, and isn't it clear that any one assuming such a respon- sibility acquires a kind of right to the remainder of the trust, especially if he is going to use it in a perfectly honest endeav- or to replace the first portion unfortunately lost? As Mr. Ledgeral reasoned himself into a more elevated   24o         NEVEER AGAIN. and philosophic view of the matter, and his mental perturba- tion abated, his appetite returned, and he rang for Joseph and inquired if the ladies had finished breakfast. "'All done sar, 'cept Miss Ledgeral, sar, she nebber don't done 'til 'bout twelve o'clock." "Well, what can you give me in a hurry? I had no ap- petite at first, but I believe I will eat a few mouthfuls before I go out." "Ebbery ting dat's hot am cold, sar, but I can get you a turkey's leg debbled in 'bout five minutes." "Well, that will do, Joseph, and tell John to have my coupn at the door in half an hour." Mr. Ledgeral seldom rode down town in his own carriage. He recollected an old maxim of his father's, that the young fellow who rode down to business in his own carriage, generally had to walk in his old age. Mr. Ledgeral was still young, that is he walked as vigorously as ever, and liked the exercise, and when he rode in an omnibus he felt much safer amid the jam and crush of carts and carriages. Still there are'times when a little osten- tation is necessary, and a sight of his prancing bays and well- known livery might in this time of pressure and panic do the street" good. "'Pears to me," said Joseph, as Mr. Ledgeral drove off after a hurried, but hearty breakfast-" 'pears to me we ain't going to bust nor nothing dis time. I recomlect way back to thirty-sebben--  Lord, I was a young man den!--when we had ter sospend for a week. Nobody eat any debble turkey- leg den. No, sar.

Good-morning, sar! walk in, sar!" exclaimed Joseph, throwing open the front door in an- swer to a ring of the bell, and saluting Luther, who stood upon the steps. "For Miss Helen, sar? ah, yes, I will gib it to her 31%ISidi8: . :*I, ;UinRrp; ii+yyinc;Lxr-w1-gib itto he          . . ....... .... AI   NE VERL' AGA VN.       241 -she is in de parlor now. Won't you gib it yourself? 'Pears to me," continued the old man, as Luther, having handed him his card and a roll of manuscript addressed to Miss Helen Ledgeral, turned and tripped rapidly down the steps, "'pears to me,"-but the sentence was left unfinished, as Mrs. Ledg- cral at that moment stepped into the hall. "What is that, Joseph?" "It is a card from one ob de young gemmenob de party," replied Joseph, dexterously whipping the roll of manuscript into his voluminous coat pocket and dropping the card into his silver waiter. Mrs. Ledgeral took the card and looked at it. "Nonsense!" she exclaimed, twisting up the card in her fingers, and leisurely ascended the stairs. Joseph put his head into the parlor. "Miss Helen," he said, looking around to see that no one was present. "Dat young man ob de steamboat! He bring dis for you. I doesn't tink it is a bilyer doo, cause it's rolled up so. No, I doesn't tink it is a bilyer doo." "Nonsense!" exclaimed Helen, taking the roll. Dat's just what her mudder say," muttered Joseph as he left the room. "Nonsense! I guess it is nonsense, but 'pears to me der is a good deal ob it about." The old man had no reference especially to Luther's poetry, and was quite unconscious of the wide application to modern poetry his remark was capable of. Helen waited not to unroll the manuscript, but tripped lightly from the parlor up stairs. The door of her mother's room stood open, and the naughty girl was going to steal quietly by. She had nothing to conceal-oh! no; but then her mother might make some inquiry about the manuscript in her hand, and some things are so trifling-so ridiculous in fact -that it is not pleasant to explain them. Therefore, in answer to her mother's call, she merely put her head within the half-opened door. "What is it, mamma?" "Helen, do you know that young man has called and left his card?"   242        NE VER AGAIN. "What young man, mamma?" "That Luther Lansdale." "Indeed!" "Yes, and I think it a great piece of impertinence." "It would have been more polite and attentive in hiln to have come in and paid his party call in person," replied Helen in the most innocent tone. "Pshaw!" and that was all Mrs. Ledgeral vouclhsafed to utter in reply. Very wrong in Helen to thus play upon a fond mother's feelings but we hrave never said that she was a perfect char- acter-only a very good girl, as girls go. As her mother turned away the slightest twinkle of humor lighted up the demure expression of the naughty girl's face, and rapidly mounting the stairs she gained her own room. Let us follow her and read the lines with her as she runs over them. We have said that Luther had quite a talent for drawing. Now a novelist is bound, when he makes an as- sertion, to prove it, when he can. Unlike the historian, a novelist is nothing unless he is truthful. It is the privilege of the historian to misstate facts and pervert testimony, and distort character until the confounded reader is left with the very dimmest conceptions of what is true, and what is not true; but the novelist mnust tell nothing that in the depths of his moral consciousness he does not know to be true, and he is bound to furnish his proof-he is bound to make his characters think, say, and do, at least, a little of what he vaunts their ability, so as to let the reader judge for himself. Alas, that this rule should be so often utterly neglected! We should, however, hardly be able to afford so much space to a proof that Luther has a turn for drawing, were it not that the verses themselves contain an applicable moral.

'NEVEL'R A GAAIN.    ,253 As Mr. Ledgeral's carriage moved down into the thickest of the crowd at Fulton Street, he grew not only perfectly com- posed, but even elated. In the first place the affair was set- tled, and, as the good book says, it is wrong to put your hand to the plough and look back. Banish these vain thoughts and regrets, and useless sentimentalizings. This world is a world of struggle. No matter how much the preacher denounces the objects of the struggle, we are so constituted that we can- not help taking a deep interest in the vanities around us. The fault-if there is a fault-is the fault of circumstance, and it is sheer nonsense to talk and preach the way people do. The mcment you come to put the matter into precise scientific lan- guage, the fallacy is apparent; you see the absolute necessity for the adaptation of our temperaments and our mental and moral habitudes to the peculiar character of our environments. The great object, then, is success. No matter at what cost of health or even conscience. The world worships it. Society rewards it with her best gifts. Not to succeed is wicked. It is only the successful man who can really do much good in the world. And how easy for the successful man to atone for alny- thing wrong which he has done. He does not always do it, and there he is to blame; and; in such cases, he will, unques- tionably, be blamed, if not here, at least hereafter. But if he always has his money ready for the plate, if he heads subscrip- tion lists for philanthropic purposes, presides on committees of benevolent institutions, and does a pretty fair amount of private charity, why, just think of what an amount of good he may do; and it is only a successful man that can do good in this way. True, Mr. Ledgeral was not exactly satisfied with the force of this reasoning, but it had its soothing effect, and why con- sider its weak points too closely? We all have the faculty of shutting our eyes to logical flaws when we don't want to see them. The same as some of us have to material sights and scenes. How often in walking the streets do we come across some shocking or revolting sight, or sound, or smell?-a filthy, reeling drunkard; a worn-out omnibus-horse kicking   254         IE VER A GA I. and strugglingas he lies on the slippery pavement; a wretched and abandoned girl,-flaunting her misery in tawdry finery; a volley of profanity and blackguardism from some licensed devil's den; or some horrible odor from unmoved garbage or neglected gutters, bad enough in itself, but which is infinitely more horrible as a suggestion of intense rottenness in munici- pal high-places!-How often we see, hear, or smell something of the kind; and how miserable we should be if the sensitive ones among us had not the happy faculty of shutting down the windows of the mind upon the reports of the senses, and men- tally turningsway, as if the sight, sound, or smell were not; as if it had no objective existence. So it is in ethics and in logic. The disagreeable facts of duty and truth are continu- ally meeting us, and what miserable devils we should be in the beautiful and splendid society of to-day, if we were com- pelled, by our mental constitution, to look at them-to stare straight at them, to take them in in their full force, or if, by some accident, having sucked tl em, as irritating and offend- i-ng materials, clear into the inmost recesses of consciousness, we had not the power, oyster-like, of secreting a benign enve- lope, and converting the rough grains and thorns of truth and right into beautiful, smooth, glittering pearls and jewels, for a fastidious moral sense to play with. Another elevating and soothing influence that swept across Mr. Ledgeral's mind, as lie reached the head of what is known as par excellence " the street," was simple sympathy with outward circumstances. Just as when in some majestic cathedral, amid the lofty arches; the dusky aisles ; the stained windows ; the marble floors, tesselated with the memento moris of departed faith, or valor, or beauty; the mind is attuned to a feeling of the deepest devotion-just as when, in some Al- pine valley, where the mountains lift their heads into. the region of eternal snow, and their sunless, sombre flanks are lighted only by the gleam of the glacier; an emotion of gran- deur and sublimity steals over the soul, and lifts it from nature up to nature's God-just as when by some lonely lake, dimpled in wooded hills, illumined by a summer's setting sun,   NE VE R AGAA, G  or, as when by some gentle brook, flowing at noontide, in shadowy coolness, through fields and pastures specked and spangled with beauty, and sparkling and tinkling with all the grateful sights and sounds of mani's first and happiest occu- pation, the heart is overwhelmed with a flood of soft, loving sentiment, a thrilling sense of the beautiful diffusing itself --through our whole frame, and looking up in an ecstasy of joy, we cry, "God made the country, man made the town,-I will go where I can best enjoy God's work; I will have a nice little villa, where I can praise Him forever "-just so, when one turns into "the street," the bustle, the confusion, the countless evidences and suggestions of financial activity, the hurrying crowds, the eager faces, the ever-slamming bank- doors, the yawning brokers' dens, with hosts of men and boys diving down, and then bubbling up again to the surface, many of them flustered and excited, many of them worn and cadav- erous-looking, as if they had been chewed-up once and spit out again by some horrible monster-just- so the mysterious chain of sympathy begins to vibrate, the pulse quickens, the muscles quiver, the hands burn and itch, the blood rushes to that little fasciculus of the brain whose spiral twisting, ac- cording to the great Professor Tyndal, produces the sentiment of greed, and a flood of emotion surges home upon the heart. The poor innocent who ventures into "the street" soon feels as must have felt an old knight, amid the flaunting of banners, and clanking- of steel, and the exhortations of Peter the her- mit. He feels that he too must draw his sword, or, if not a sword, at least a bill of exchange, or a bank-check, and rush into the heady current of the fight. What the tomb of Christ was to a Tancred, or a Godfrey, or the Holy Grail to Sir Galahad, a good bank-balance, with a portfolio full of notes and bonds, a gold mine, a steamboat line, or the majority of the shares in a big railroad, is to the knight errant of modern society, who, in quest of adventures, once wanders amid the enchanted cobble-stones of " the street." And what more natural than that this excitement; this in- tense preoccupation with the most important interests of life;   256         NE VER A G.4 IV. this tremendous exacerbation of the combative instincts; this complete concentration of aM1 our powers, mental and physical, in what used to be foolishy decried as a vain heaping up of riches, but which is now known, since Darwin's discovery, as an inevitable and universal struggle for existence-whlat more natural than that this should blunt our perceptions of right and wrong, and somewhat obfuscate our moral sight? Richard was a generous man, and chivalric-but is it to be supposed that, if, at the confused and bloody melbes of Li- messo, or Askalon, his two-handed sword, in its wide, death- dealing sweep, had encountered the head of woman or child, -is it to be supposed that he would have stopped to whine over the accident, or have even felt in his lion-heart one pang at anything that might perhaps be strictly considered uncourt- eous and unknightly in the blow? So in the turmoil of "the street," no one can be accountable for all the accidents, the slips and slides, the little malfeasances that almost invariably occur in the course of any tremendous and exciting deed of financial deering-do. That is, not so fully accountable as a man who has never ventured beyond the quiet pursuits of professional life, or who, shrinking from the glare of specula- tion, has wholly confined his etiolated intellects to the shady walks of humble trade. Of course no one would like to ven- ture so far out of the path of church dogma as to maintain that a Wall Street financier-like a New York office-holder-is not in a moderate degree accountable for any little deviations from the rigid path of right or truth. He is accountable, and he knows it. He is accountable to his bankers, he is account- able to his brokers, he is perhaps accountable to the stock- board, and to his club; but beyond that, he loses all sense of accountability, and therefore it would be wrong to try him and judge him by laws well enough in the abstract, but hav- ing, in times of excitement, but little or no force in "the street." We have used very freely, and perhaps at too much length, the very commonplace figure of a battle, in order to show the great trials, and temptations, and accidents that   NEVER A G4AIz.         5 5 7 257 visit the career of a virtuous speculator, and to prevent, or at least to mitigate as far as possible, any harshness of judgment in the case of the rich Mr. Ledgeral, the respectable Mr. Ledgeral, the head of the great firm of Ledgeral, Shippen & Co. Perhaps a better figure, certainly a newer one, to illustrate the mental condition and moral sentiments of a stock speculator, would be that of an enterprising traveller endeavoring to ford on horseback a raging, rapid river. He starts from the bank, a little fearful perhaps, but full of hope, and with all his senses about him: a few steps, he is up to his saddle-girths in the raging, roaring wa- ters. And now everything grows confused and unsteady. The whole world seems turning topsy-turvy, and his eyes fairly swim in his head as the countless swirls of foam go seething by. All that he can really be said to see is that, if he keeps a straight course, he is gone. He feels, he knows that, while giving his beast a loose rein, he must-yes, he must -head a little up-stream. Now that was all that Mr. Ledg- eral was doing when he borrowed the very confiding young Count's money: he was simply heading a little up-stream. Had any inquisitive people chosen to dog Mr. Ledgeral's footsteps after he had entered " the street," they would have been struck with an apparent inconsistency in his movements. First, he went to the bank where he kept his private account, and, demanding his box of securities, drove to a broker, with whom he left orders to sell immediately one hundred thousand in bonds of the Illinois Central and Hudson River Railroads. Next to an exchange broker, with whom he left his bill on the Barings with directions to have the proceeds ready in an hour's time, when he would call for them. Next to another stock-broker's office, leaving peremptory orders to buy fifty thousand in city sixes and certain bank stocks. But why buy and sell simultaneously? Why not cash the bill of exchange and use the proceetds directly? Ah, there comes a beautiful example of the financial punctilio. l'o borrow a few unregistered, and consequently disposable secu- ties belonging to another person that happen to be in your /   258        NEIVER AGAIN. possession, is one thing; to appropriate money sent with specific orders for investment is another. Mr. Ledgeral had to answer his correspondent's letter, and he felt the impossi- bility of writing a direct flagrant untruth. Besides if tile worst came to the worst, his full power of attorney would en- able him to quietly borrow the money-no matter how in- vested. And now again to his selling broker's office, where the certified checks of some of the best men in town were await- ing him, and thence to the counting-house at Burling Slip. How proudly pranced the bays as the liveried coachman deftly guided them through the crowds of market-carts, express-wagons, omnibuses, and lumbering drays. Quite like a conquering hero Mr. Ledgeral drew up at the door, and, dismounting from his triumphal car, and briskly ascending to the private office, laid the checks upon Mr. Gainsby's desk. And so was saved the great house of Ledgeral, Shippen & Co., at a time when nothing short of an Astor, a Vander- bilt, a Moses Taylor, a Dan Drew, a John Morrissey, or a Gould could have borrowed a dollar. How many persons and firms on the brink of ruin have been saved in a similar way, and the good public never a bit the wiser?   CHAPTER XIII. Table Talk-A Worldly Woman-Spiritualistic Infidelity-Mrs. Lasher's Discourse on Congeniality and Grammar-Whoppers Vulgar as usual -More and more Metaphorical-The Divaricating Principle in Domestic Life Noted. THE "dinner-things" had vanished as if by magic, but really by the dexterous swoop of a sable Ganymede and two slattern Hebes of the Milesian type. Tlle comestibles and condiments had pretty much gone maw-ward, and were rapidly being developed into the higher .forms of organic life in the persons of Mrs. Lasher and Dr. Droney and other guests making up the gratified and grateful circle that daily gathered around Miss Jones' generous board. The dirty glasses and greasy plates and empty pudding-dishes had gone kitchen-ward, followed by the soiled and rainbow-hued table- cloth and the rumpled napkins, exhaling an odor compounded of bar-soap, beef-steak gravy, and onion-sauce. The hot political discussion had ended as usual-both sides getting the best of it. The latest city and foreign news had been ex-. hausted as a topic of conversation, and the brilliant current of chaff with which the meal had commenced was reduced to a few volatile flakes from the threshing-machine of the editor of the Universe. A clever writer could in this way, or something like it, fill two pages with the announcement that dinner was over, but as we have not the two pages to spare, we forbear to test at this time our abilities, or to experiment upon the patience of the reader. Sufficient to say that a very good general board- ing-house dinner had come to an end, and that some of the convives had risen, and sauntered off into the drawing-room, to a course of piano and cards, while others still lingered around the mahogany sipping their coffee or tea.   260        NEVER AGA .\L "And now my sucking Crcesus," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, "when you have put a colophon to Miss Jones' bounteous feed, just let us know what you intend to do with yourself." "Put a what, Mr. Whoppers?" demanded Mrs. Lasher in her most sepulchral voice. "A colophon." "And what is a colophon?" "Good heavens! Mrs. Lasher," replied M3r. Whoppers, "you an advocate of woman's rights, and not know what a colophon is! It is a corps of cavalry. It is the last lick with the broom-stick in a domestic muss. It is the coming female suffrage which is to close up the miserable accounts of society, and write' Finis' to all the imperfections of the world in general." "Nonsense!" exclaimed Mrs. Lasher. "Exactly. ' You know how it is yourself.' But if you think nonsense keep it to yourself. I'll none of it." "C What folly, Mr. Whoppers, for a sensible man to talk as you do. Explain yourself." "And must I ravel up the seam of folly? Not a bit of it; and so, Luther, when you have colophonized your retreat- ing dinner with that cup of tea, what are you going to do with yourself? If you have no engagement I have something to'pro- pose." "What is it?" demanded Luther. "Why, Mrs. Stichen was quite impressive the other night at the party, and asked me to come up and see her. She takes a great interest in you, I know. What do you say? For a wonder I am free to-night. Shall we go and pay our devotions at the shrine of the rising goddess?" "I'm willing," replied Luther. "She gave me a very cor- dial invitation also." "A young man might be better employed," interposed Mrs. Lasher, "'than in visiting such a person. Don't you think so, Dr. Droney?

Anywhere and at any time it's awful; but, in the presence of this reverend and holy man, and of a lady who, if not old enough to be your mother, is not such a mere girl as not to know what is due to female propriety and decorum."              I "Female propriety and decorum be-be hanged-damned, I was going to say, but I won't just at this moment. What I want to know is - " "Oh! oh!" cried Mrs. Lasher shuddering, and holding both hands to her face. "Oh, Doctor dear, do you hear him? He denounces-he does more, he damns female propriety and decorum. No, no, Mr. Whoppers, don't go on, sir ; stop imme- diately; I will not listen to you ; I will not listen to you ; it is too awful; it is too horrible. Oh, Doctor, can't you say a word to the young man who is thus being led astrayz?" Thus exhorted, the Doctor turned to Luther, and ex- claimed in tones of solemn severity, "You see, young man, the awful gulf yawning at your feet. Beware, beware, Luther! listen not to the song of the charmer, charm he or she ever so wisely." Luther threw himself back in his chair and laughed heart- ily, "Don't laugh, young man, don't laugh; respect my supe- rior years and experience, and respect my sacred office. It is my duty to warn you in season and out of season, line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little."   262        NE V ER A GAIV. "Look, here now," shouted Mr. Whoppers, at the top of his voice. Stop all this caterwauling, and answer one ques tion. I want to know if you have anything to say against the character of Mrs. Stichen?" "Yes, I have," firmly replied Mrs. Lasher. "And what is it?" demanded Mr. Whoppers. "Well, she's a, a-' "She's a what? '; "She's a worldly woman. There now!" "Is that all?" "Oh, Doctor, do you hear that? Is that all? all indeed! I tell you that she is a downright worldly woman. All she thinks about is dressing and spending money at Madame Volorem's; and driving about in her new clarence, wilh glass windows all around, so that she can be seen by everybody; and showing her baby face at operas, and balls, and parties, and even the church. I tell you she is a mincing, simpering, affected, stuck-up piece. When she boarded here I never liked her, although you all went mad about ler singing; and since that little rascal, her husband, has made so much money, I don't want to know her, and whenever I meet her, I cut her dead. The Doctor, here, knows how worldly she is." "Indeed I do," replied the Doctor. "I have tried her- I have tried her in the balance, and found her wanting. I'll give you an instance. I went to her and told her that a large tribe of the Wanabangos, residing in the Jebbledoon moun-0 tains, were living a life of cannibalism, and downright nudity, and utterly without the benefits of stated preaching, or any kind of Sabbath-day instruction. It made not the lightest impression upon her; she said that she had already coptrib- uted, all she could afford, to the domestic missions, but if there were any of the Wanabango tribe round Cherry or Greenwich streets, or down in the Five Points, or Mackerel- ville, she would be willing to strain a point and give some- thing more. What could I say to that? I saw that she com- pletely misunderstood the whole object and design of that, particular kind of missionary work in which I am engaged. I  .- ; . --  , .Y..    AE VER A GAi L\.        26 )                    J thought I would try her with something else, and I said, 'My dear Mrs. Stichen, I have in hand another most important work- one that recommends itself to the loving consideration of every pious and affluent Protestant. We have a beautiful little church at Skinnersdale, in Nevada-tower truncated as yet; but real stone mullions. Well, owing to the unaccount- able bursting of a whiskey-still, and to the lamentable occur- rence of three or four street fights, the congregation has been retduced to less than half-a-dozen members, and no one of these has anything to give or would give it if he had. Now this little Protestant temple is soon to be sold, under fore- closure of mortgage, unless we who feel an interest in the cause come forward with the necessary funds. And if it is soll-think' of it! think of the awful fact; it will inevitably fall into the hands of the Romanists! There are numbers of them-some wealthy, and all bigoted-and they are deter- mined to buy it, and carry up that unfinished steeple, and crown it with a large gilt cross. ' Think of it, Mrs. Stichen,' said I, 'think that the small sum of five thousand dollars will save that church,' and I made my appeal in my most touching tone and manner. But would you believe it? it had no effect; woutld you believe it? that woman let me go out of that house -that splendid house, filled with the latest and most resplen. dent vanities of household adornment, with all that delighteth the eve, and administereth to the comfort of the body-woulc you believe it? I say; she let me go out from that gilded saloon; out froln that frescoed and tessellated hall, down those massive and richly ornamented freestone steps, into the street, without a dollar; yea, without even a piece of frac- tional currency to the value of ten cents. A menial in a white neck-cloth, and a much better coat than my own, closed the carved oaken door behind me. 'Avaunt thee, Satan,' I ejaculated, for I felt the tempter urging me to a little holiest indignation, but I would not give way to him." "Well, at least,' exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, who had now recovered his good-humor, "she offered you cake and wine, or something of that sort?"  .v  riil . .,. ...    264        NE VE ER A GA IAq The Doctor shook his head. "Nothing of the kind, and I almost ready to drop from exhaustion." "Wrong, certainly," replied' Mr. Whoppers; "if you W1ee ready to, drop from exhaustion, she ought to have been ready to drop fromn a bottle or decanter, or something of that sort, I begin to think that she is a very worldly woman. She undler stands more of the world than I thought she did, but I anll glad that there is nothing really affecting her moral char- acter.'" "I don't know that--I don't know that," interrupted Mrs. Lasher, in her deep -tragedy voice, and shaking her head vi- ciously. "Ah, you mean that looking at the nudities of the Wana- bangos is a sin, a moral delinquency." "No, I don't; I mean that riding and driving with such an impudent-looking fellow as that Boggs is suspicious, yes, very suspicious, and the Doctor here will tell you that no woman should do anything suspicious." "That is true, sir. Suspicion, sir, for a woman, is bad, sir, very bad. She should be always like Cxesar's wife, you know, who hadn't any suspicion." "But mere suspicion don't amount to much. It may be entirely groundless," said Mr. Whoppers. "I don't care if it is groundless," exclaimed Mrs. Lasher. "She can't be a virtuous woman who allows herself to be suspected. But 1 know how it is with you men. You, all of you, take up the cause of a good-looking woman ; not that she has any looks to boast of, but almost any woman can wind any of you right round her finger." "She must begin by winding her arms around us, Mrs. Lasher. But where is your ,woman's rights question. 1 thought that men were such horrible monsters and tyrants." "So they are to the good and the virtuous. It is the vile women, the silly women, the ungodly women at whose feet you men bow down and humble yourselves, and encourage them t( flaunt their worldliness in the faces of the nobler portion of their sex. But as to Mrs. Stichen, it isn't alone her characte   f  \ ArEVER AGAIN.          265 for morality or for virtue that I object to," continued Mrs. Lasher. "It is her mental character. It is her intellectual character. She has no belief in anything. She scouts the plainest evidence. She is an infidel, and that in a woman is awful. It mayl do for you men. I know you are one, too, Mr. Whoppers." "That is," said Mr. Whoppers, " she does not believe in I -your friend, Dr. Quackenhummer." "She doesn't believe in homceopathy at all; nor in hydro- pathy; nor in isopathy; nor in electropathy. She says that she don't believe that women, and clergymen, and poets, and editors, however clever, who have not a scientific hair in their heads, are good authorities on medical snubjects. But what will you do when you come to be on your death-bed?. said I. 'll, I will make my exit secundzu   artem,' said she. I never heard anything more horrible. Besides, she don't be- lieve in the woman's rights movement. She don't believe in the elevation of woman. She says she doesn't care to elevate herself; all she wants is to elevate Stichen.." "That is wrong; decidedly wrong," exclaimed Mr. Whop- pers. "Stichen don't want any one to elevate him, he can elevate himself. I recollect one night Stichen gave some of us a little supper at Delmonico's, and he elevated himself about as high as the table, and kicked all the bottles off." The peculiarity of Mrs. Lasher's conversation was that once having turned on the tap of talk, it continued to flow in spite ,of any interruption. Once under way, even Doctor Droney could only now and then get his pipe in. "And more than all;" continued Mrs. Lasher, "she don't believe in spirits. Neither do you, Mr. Whoppers, but it is because of your ignorance and indifference in all supermun- dane affairs; and I make allowance for you; you are a man, and one of that class of men whose coarse sensual natures must ever weigh them' down to the things of this world ; but Mrs. Stichen has no excuse; she cannot plead ignorance. I have tried to enlighten her. I have taken her to three or four of our most interesting sittings, when the manifestations    , ,     t   266        NEVERY AGAIN. have been most extraordinary; she even had evidences of the spirits in her own person. We were all sitting one evening round the mediumistic board when it began to jump up and down in a terrible manner, and Mrs. Stichen felt something tread upon her toes. 'If it wasn't a spirit, what was it?' said I. 'I don't know,' said she, 'but I have known a lady's toes to be trod upon half-a-dozen times at a boarding-house breakfast-table in broad daylight.' The good-for-nothing thing! I have no doubt that the toes were her own, and it wasn't Stichen who did it. I know his legs are too short. But she says to me, 'Mrs. Lasher, I will believe there is something in it when I am satisfied on three points. The first is, why is it that the spirits of people who in thi' world were clever and well educated, talk in the next nothing but bosh and bad grammar?'" "And your answer, Madam?" exclaimed Doctor Droney. "Tell Mr. Whoppers your answer. I think on all except one point it was perfectly conclusive; on that my explanation is unquestionably nearer the truth." "Well, we will not argue that now, my dear Doctor. I know your view is a strong one, but I am not going to give in. I said to Mrs. Stichen, 'You are mistaken about the bad gram- mar. Grammar is an entirely arbitrary and conventional mat- ter; and more than that, it is a capricious matter. What is grammar to-day is not grammar to-morrow. Language is continually changing; old grammatical forms are left off, and new ones adopted. Besides, see how the authorities of to-day differ among themselves. Mr. Moon, Dean Alford, and Grant White! see how they fight and squabble about words. No sooner does one of them write a book, trying to settle what is and what is not correct in our English speech, than the others pitch into him and tear him all to pieces. More than this, it is always assumed that we speak English, and therefore ought to be governed by the rules of English grammar. Now I contend that we do not speak' English. We speak the great American language. It is a language that resembles English, but it is a richer and more copious language; a more highly   NE ER AGAIN.          26 developed language; a more expansive language, with a greater capability of adaptation to the growing exigencies of human nature; a thoroughly elastic and springy language, and therefore it ought not to be cramped and confined by the nar row rules of English Grammar. Now if this is true, why should the spirits be accused of speaking bad grammar, when they are only speaking or writing the improved grammar of the supernal sphere-the grammar of the great American future?' I had no need to say anything more, had I?" de- manded Mrs. Lasher. "Not a word," replied Mr. Whoppers, "'you done your level best, as they say in the supernal sphere. I consider that pint settled. But what was the other pint, or quart-- believe there were two of'em?" "'The next thing,' said Mrs. Stichen, 'is why, when any really scientific man-any man accustomed to observation and, investigation, appears, the writs won't perform, or give but very imperfect and unsatisfactorymanifestations of themselves.' I know where she got her question from-it came from that miserable allopath Dr. Petkaff, who is all the time fluttering around her and stuffing her stomach with pills and potiqo and her head with fashionable flummery. But I answered her. Says I, Congeniality is only an important element of mundane existence; but it is an essential element of supernal life. Now congeniality is a compound, and if you analyze it you will find that one of its most important ingredients is a coincidence of method and form in spiritualistic speculations; an identity of conception in the fundamentals of the trans- cendental, or, in plainer words, a complete parallelism in our espective receptivities of the abstract and the absolute. Without this parallelism, this coincidence, there can be no ongeniality, and it stands to reason that withoutcongeniality the spirits cannot manifest themselves fully.' Mrs. Stichen," continued Mrs. Lasher, couldn't say a word more on that point, but says she: 'Why do the spirits perform the most wonderful tricks only in the dark?'" "Evil spirits, evil spirits," energetically exclaimed Doctor   268    ,    NE VER AG,4A r. Droney, "prefer darkness, rather than light. Reason plain as day." "My dear Doctor," said Mrs. Lasher, "I can not admit that at all." "Yes, yes," interupted Mr. Whoppers, "the Doctor is right, it is the bad spirits. Plenty of them around, and they have made me prefer the darkness very often." "But Mrs. Stichen does not believe in either good spirits or bad spirits," said Mrs. Lasher; "she does not believe in spirits at all." "She does not even believe in the devil," ejaculated the Doctor. "The devil she don't," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "That is too horrible. Come, Luther, let's constitute ourselves a mission of two, and go and convert her. Perhaps if Stichen is at home he will let us see what kind of spirits he believes in. Good-bye, Doctor. Good-bye, Mrs. Lasher-don't lose your spirits while we are gone; you know how to keep your spirits up-eh?" and Mr. Whoppers elevated his elbow and turned his hand downward, at the same time making a gurg liin sound in his throat, and hurriedly closing the door, fol- lowed by Luther, marched off without waiting to hear the half angry, half contemptuous comments upon his vulgarity and insolence. "That is what I call a capital cross match," said Mr. Whoppers, suddenly speaking after a silence of some minutes, during which their rapid walking had brought them by Waverley Place to the foot of Fifth Avenue. "A first-rate cross match. Style, form and action almost identical, and everything alike, except color and sex. It is true she has a little the fastest gait, but he has the most bottom. It is true she arches her neck a little too much, and he pokes his nose somewhat, but a snaffle, with a Kimble Jackson on her, and a martingale on him, would make 'em about even. And then, I tell you, once in hand, you just take 'em out on to the highfalutin course and crack 'em up with a good round paradox or half-a-dozen tin- gling puns. If you don't see the mud fly tell me I don't know the uliginous when I see it." i '- , 1 C.  r --r  YC ---r--------..' ].   INE VER AGAIN.         269 "What di7 you mean?" exclaimed Luther; "what team? when? where? Or have you mounted a metaphor? Do you know, Mr. Whoppers, you are a devil of a fellow for a meta- phor! Once up and astride, you carry your meaning-that is when you have any such load, for I must admit you generally ride light enough,-you carry your meaning so fast and so far that to follow it is impossible. You are as incomprehensible as- "Mrs. Lasher or Dr. Droney. Exactly, that is the team I mean. But here we are at the house," and Mr. Whoppers ran up the steps and pulled the bell. "I hope she is at home," he continued, "and Stichen too. I want to see how the droll little fellow looks and acts in his 'magnificent house. I'll have some fun with him, you'll see. I'll make him split him- self with laughing, and I'll chaff him till he thinks himself in a bran-bin. " A solemn man in black cloth and white necktie opened the door, and in answer to their inquiries ushered them with a grand bow into the first drawing-room. "Do you know, Luther, that I begin to feel quite flustered. I didn't dream that I was going to have the door opened by an assistant rector of Trinity parish." ' Oh, stop your nonsense," exclaimed Luther, "I want to look at these pictures. What a lovely little landscape! Ah that brook with the cattle drinking-there is no make-believe about that. That's running water, and the cattle are down- right thirsty; and that rustic bridge--why, I've driven the cows across many a time, and many a time I've dangled a worm with a pin-hook over that broken rail. And that cot- tage in the distance with that tender light glinting on it, and that subdued general luminousness trickling down through the fluttering leaves, clear into the shade. Oh, that is charming. I shouldn't wonder if that is by Kensett. Don't you think that is by Kensett, Mr. Whoppers?" "It's all the same," replied Mr. Whoppers "jf it isn't exactly 'by Kensett,' it is a picture you admiringly ' Can sit' by."   I0         NEVER AGA IZ. "And I shouldn't wonder," exclaimed Luther, "if that were a Church." "To be sure; there in the distance you can see the steeple." Luther made a gesture of impatience. "Well, well, suck your fill of the ideal, I go in for the practical. Here is the card-basket. Let us see who Mrs. S. has got on her visiting-list; quite a pile, I declare. She is getting on in quantity-how about the quality? third or fourth card from the top is always the biggest of the big bugs. Never lead your best card first, unless you have in your hand all the trumps in the pack. It don't do to parade a conde- scension too proudly; let the important fact leak out with a straggling crumpled corner about the middle' of the pile. Good, here are some of the real old genuine bell-bearers of uppertendom; Mrs. Theoderic Boggs-Boggs' mother-blue blood! every drop of it, real Gothic; Mrs. Gerardus Vander- hoben, all the way from New Amsterdam in a coach and six; and by George, here is Mrs. Douglas Livingston; mnanes of the Earl of Linlithgow, I salute thee! and Mrs. Leroy, and Mrs. Mary Tudor, and-oh! good gracious; here is Mrs. Stuyvesant K. Delphin. Ah, who would think now, to see her gracefully sustaining her social and official honors, that seven generations ago there was war between Peter the Testy, and the Jarseys? And I declare here is Mrs. Thanely. I cannot flatter her, be- cause the truth outruns my tongue. No- -' Lay on Macduff: And damn'd be he that first cries, "Hold, enough "' And Mrs. Montebello too. And here's Madame de Basseville -beauty as well as fashion!-and Mrs. Ratherwade-wit and grace combined! This is charming. This is all Boggs'work. He knows how, and what strings to pull. Tiles Ia fice/e, ma femme; and up goes the curtain, and the play begins. He'll make a fortune out of or through Stichen; but I am glad to see that he is doing good fair honest work for h-s money. He does not fob her off with anything under the "ultimate five I  i -'rr  ,  .   NEVE R AGAIN.         271 hundred." I wonder when he is going to let us give a small and sec!ct gabble-gobble. There is enough here to begin with." "What the deuce do you mean by a gabble-gobble?" de- manded Luther. "Why, what used to be called a 'reception,' where people meet to gabble and gobble, and show their dresses, and prove their connection with certain circles, and exhibit to each other their claims to a certain position-anything and everything, rather than for mere social and intellectual enjoyment. Mrs. Stichen must give one soon, if only to exhibit her trophies and parade her success, and if she leaves us out I'll take the direst revenge on Boggs-I won't abuse him again in the Uni- verse for six months at least. And Mrs. Struggles came also!" continued 'Mr. Whoppers holding up her card. "Well, that is an indication that Mrs. Stichen is really getting on in the fashionable world; and Madame D'Oberge! that is a still big- ger indication. You don't catch her wasting shot on vermin or small game." As Mr. Whoppers threw down the card Mr. Stichen entered the room, with a calm and quiet air-quite a contrast to his former vivacious and lively manner. The early and later styles of Raphael were not more different. Look at the St. Cecilia in the Bologna gallery, or the Spozalitzo at the Brera, and you will see, in conception and execution, marked evi- dences of the Peruginesque. Go then to the Uffizzi or the Vatican, and there you will see the untrammelled, disenthrall- ed genius of Raphael himself. So with Mr. Stichen. To any one who had studied him in his chrysalis state; or in other words, in his retail condition, he would have exhibited all over the flibbity-gibbity touch. Now everything had changed; drawing, coloring, and feeling. He had caught the genuine Midastic style. If he had been nothing but whole- sale for ten years, he could not have mingled his dabs of dig.. nity and benignity more grandly. "How are you?" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers-Stichen-he was going to say, but he hesitated involuntarily, and said, "Mr. Stichen."    2S72 -      XNEVER AGAIA. There was something in the get-up of his friend that struck even the coarse perceptions of Mr. Whoppers. In the first place he was clearly two inches taller; his head sat fur- ther back; and his sternum projected an inch and a half more than it did when he first measured himself for shirts anatomical changes that have always been noted as the con. sequences, or at least the concomitants, of an extra mnillion. Besides this he had on a perfectly plain linen bosom ; no em- broidery, no frills or fancy plaits, and the plain shirt-front had nothing but plain nacre buttons, no jewelled studs, no twenty- thousand-dollar diamond breastpin, like a blackleg, a pick- pocket, or a New York office-holder. Mr. Whoppers could see this at a glance, and even he- the generally irrepressible-wilted, and said "Mr. Stichen." "I am very happy to see you," said that gentleman. "Mrs. Stichen will also be happy to see you if you will have the goodness to walk into the dining-room. We keep an open fire-place with a wood fire in the dining-room, and we find it so much more agreeable than these miserable coal- fires, or than that horrible furnace heat, that we make that room our sitting-room when we are alone; and there is no one with us now but Mr. Boggs. Ah, Mr. Lansdale, I am glad to see you too. The pictures? Ah, yes! The pictures are I believe very fine. Painting is a subject about which I know nothing; literally nothing. I depend altogether on my wife's taste and judgment, assisted by Mr. Boggs. I could have got copies and chromos that would have suited me just as well, but my wife objected, and I said, 'Do as you please, my dear,' and the consequence is I am getting the reputation of a great patron of art, without an idea of a good picture be- yond the frame." This dignified-humility, this confiding frankness, seemed to tickle Mr. Whoppers very much. He laughed heartily. He recalled to mind the time, only a few months past, when Mr. Stichen used to attend the Academy exhibitions, and discuss the respective merits of the various pictures with vivacity. He recollected when Mr.   NE VER A GA IN.        2 73 Stichen used to haunt picture-sales; at first buying the most astonishing green and yellow landscapes ; then getting rid of them, as his taste improved, and at last resolutely working his way up through copies of the old masters and wonderful genre subjects with some vulgar or commonplace sentiment sticking out as stiff and strong as a crow-bar and through grand his- torical pieces, of the coal-ashes and brick-dust school, in which the drawing and composition might justly be said to rival the color. "Look here now, Stichen," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, who had recovered from the first shock of that gentleman's shirt- bosom, "look here now," slapping him familiarly on the shoulder, " you can't shove your gammon into this cove. Just let us know the exact figure at which a fellow can affect to know nothing and care nothing about the pictures he spends his money on: a million now? or say two million, eh? A poor devil with five hundred thousand I suppose must know all about pictures-be able to discuss composition, color, and drawing; talk about tone, feeling, and chiaroscuro. How I envy you, Stichen-not for your money-but because you've made your pile and are free from the burden of knowing any- thing about art, or, what is worse, the bore of pretending to know anything about it." Mr. Stichen smiled complacently. He had given up gig- gling forever. Who ever knew a great finrancier and a million- aire to giggle? "Facetious as ever," he merely observed, with a smile, and throwing open the dining-room door introduced his two vis- itors into the room where sat Mrs. Stichen and Mr. Boggs. The lady's greeting was sufficiently cordial. Two finger- tips-hardly the least mite disturbed by former intimacy with bands and button-holes-to Mr. Whoppers: the whole of her soft plump little hand to Luther. Her style, naturally quiet and subdued, had been still further adoucified by long contact with the lively and aciculated manners of her husband. It is a curious fact in domestic physics hitherto unnoted b) scientific men; escaping as yet even the philosophic insight of 1 8   O 274        NEVER AGAIN. the Saturday Review, that two directly opposite principles prevail almost at the same time with equal force. -People grow to resemble each other: man and wife in time look alike, act alike, talk alike, and think alike-the effect-of sym- pathy and the influence of the mimetic instincts! To the truth of this fact we have the general consent of mankind. It requires a profounder observation to trace in its remote effects the divaricating influence of dissimilar habits and sen- timents. For instance, how often do we find a man naturally neat and orderly driven into the most careless, disorderly, and even dirty domestic habits by the natural reaction against the over- tidiness, the rigorous comfort-destroying regularity and clean- liness of an energetic, persevering, dust-hating femme de menage. As for instance in the case of the husband of the Western widow who startled the ministering attendants at the good man's funeral by suddenly exclaiming as the sexton was about to screw down the coffin lid, "Hold on a moment, and let me dust George off;" no doubt the dear defunct had in his latter years a real longing for dirt. No doubt the final summons of " dust to dust" had been received with a resigna- tion born of the hope of an existence hereafter where brooms, brushes, and dusters are unknown. On the other hand what more common than for a 'molly-coddle' to change a good housewife into a novel-reading, lecture-haunting, shop-visiting 6' gad-about." In this way the long-continued attrition of Mr. Stichen's manner had served to foster in Madame a tendency to a state of quiet mollescence, which, as'his spirits began to feel the pressure of wealth, and every crack and cranny of his mind to be as it were caulked up with bank-notes, began in her to develop itself into a most lady-like style-a style, as Hamilton Boggs said, perfectly comme ilfaut.   CHAPTER XIV. The Distance from Bleecker Street to the Fifth Avenue-Society Science Discussion-A Big Pool in Wall Street--Is the Old Woman so rich? -Luther half confesses to Mrs. Stichen. I l- HARMED to see you, g   metlemen. I believe you know I ^ .Mr. Boggs?"And that gentleman had the condescen- sion to half rise from his low luxurious arm-chair at the corner of the sparkling fire and return the salute. The exertion, es- pecially as he had a cup of tea in his hands, was an immense one for Boggs, but Mr. Whoppers was an old acquaintance, had frequently been of service to him, and might be ag lii, and be- sides Boggs liked him personally. Clever himsell he liked to be with clever men outside his own set occasionally. Ultra refined himself, he had no objection to a little coarseness in others, when seasoned with wit or humor: and moreover, he was somewhat afraid of Mr. Whoppers. He knew that the Editor of the Universe knew him-knew all his little affecta- tions-knew how much of a humbug in some things he really was. In addition to this, Mr. Whoppers held a social position so fillly amplified somewhere about the middle slopes of fashion that so lobng as he did not attempt to surmount the very peak it was a good deal more easy to recognize him than to push or put him down. Mr. Boggs had seen but little of Luther: only once at the Ledgerals and two or three times in company with Mr. Whop- pers, but he saw that he was good-looking, modest, nice-man- nered, clever, well-educated, and industrious. Now there is no predicting the extent of greatness which a young Ameri- can with these qualities and characteristics may not achieve. 'He may perhaps become a wholesale commission-merchant; he may perhaps become a rich stock-broker, and give grand dinners to grand ladies of the beau monde, and charmingpetits   276        NE VER A GAIN. soapers to charming women of the demi monde at DeImonico's; or higher still, he may become a great banker, deal in foreign exchange, suspend, resume, and oh! altitudinous bliss!-oh! Alpine peak of social exaltation! drive a four-horse drag over the prostrate souls of a thousand parasites and flunkies. We wouldn't say that Mr. Boggs was actuated wholly by this view of the case. He rather liked the young man, and Boggs' position was so strong that he could afford to gratify a fancy now and then, and be at least moderately civil to a no. body, even while feeling his own exclusiveness and strictly maintaining the rights and privileges of a purely fashionable "society-man." "And first, I must bring you to account, Mr. Whoppers, for neglecting me so long," said Mrs. Stichen. "Do you know we have been in this house almost a year, and this'is your first visit. And you too, Mr. Lansdale, I had hoped for more attention from you,' and the lady gave Luther a little nod and a smile, that went bubbling to his brain like a glass of Champagne. "Oh, Mrs. Stichen, you forget," replied Mr. Whoppers, "how far it is from Bleecker Street to the Fifth Avenue." "How far do you call it, Mr. Whoppers?" '"About five hundred thousand miles, or as far as to the moon and back." "Nonsense, Mr. Whoppers; you are always figurative or funny." "No nonsense about it, my dear Mrs. Stichen; you sud- denly spread your wings and soar aloft, and a very pretty flight you have made of it. I was looking into your card-bas- ket just now-how can you expect your humble friends to fol- low you, when they haven't any feathers to fly with?" "Well, Mr. Whoppers, I am not going to be so silly as to deny that we have taken something of a flight. All this," and the lady made a pretty little sweeping gesture with her hand, which brought the diamonds on her lingers very inno- cently into full play,-" all this is a little beyond Miss Jones' first floor front, but if you think that I am going wholly tQ for-   NE VER AGAIN.          " get Miss Jones' first floor front and its associations, or that I am going to cut old and pleasant friends because I have made some new and fashionable ones, you are mistaken." "My dear Mrs. Stitchen, don't suppose for an instant that I could think you such a-a-pardon the word-such a snob as intentionally to do anything of the kind; but a change to a certain style of living and a certain set of acquaintance ren- ders it a difficult matter on both sides to keep up former social relations."  "That is just what Mr. Boggs says; but then he agrees with me that it is bad style to drop old friends, simply because they can't keep pace with you in your ascent into the regions of fashionable life. Don't you think so, Mr. Boggs?" Thus appealed to, Mr. Boggs raised his hand depre- catingly. "One moment, my dear Mrs. Stichen; excuse me;" and handing his cup to the servant, he deliberately drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and turning it over the point of his fore-finger, delicately dabbed the edge of his upper lip half-a-dozen times so as not to disturb a hair of the well-waxed mustache. "Permit me to reply that I do think so, but that I also agree with Mr. Whoppers. In one just beginning to rise in the social scale nothing can be in worse taste than an affecta- tion of ignorance of common people; nothing more absurd than to deny upon all occasions former associations; nothing mere vulgar than a pretence to exclusiveness, and nothing more unnecessary, and even dangerous, than to drop abruptly old acquaintances and friends. Don't you see?-any airs or affectations, any social brutalities, at once sets all the gossips in society upon the qui vive, and your cousin the hack-driver, or your uncle the soap-fat man, is constantly trotted out for the amusement of your new friends, and the immense comfort of your old ones. There is Mrs. Struggles now-a case in point. What an awful time, notwithstanding Mrs. Ledgeral's assistance, she has had of it. She commenced by assuming an hereditary right to snub people, and instantly her own work in the cotton-mill, and her mother's clear-starching, she finds   278        NEVER AGA aN. chalked down in'every visiting-book that she can get her name into." "Still she has worked herself in everywhere," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers; "she is a social success." "Hardly! 'Tis true she goes everywhere, and outsiders naturally suppose that she is-you will pardon the vulgarism, Mrs. Stichen-top of the heap, but they who are adepts; they who have mastered the arcana of social science ;.they who are to the manner born, know better. 'Tis the same as it is in London. How many Americans, and Englishmen too, for that matter, believe that the countess of Isola Bella, or the great banker Ahashuerus Billionah, are the very largest and purest globules of butyraceous material floating in the crenme de la creme. But ask my mother's old friend, the dowager Duchess of Dobbershire, and she will tell you that fashiona- ble notoriety, there as here, is not by any means a perfect measure of social position; and that devotees of the ineffable Bosh may be bien repandus, and apparently all powerful, at the same time that it is known to the initiated, and known even to themselves, that they have not advanced a step beyond the tolerated of the outer porch; and that they havn't the smallest chance of lifting the veil--of penetrating to the Holy of Holies, or of mingling their coarse voices with the awful, but mellifluous, oracular utterances of the adytum." "Mr. -Boggs, may I ask you to write that down for hme some time?" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "I'd give five dollars a column. I've always said that I don't know a fellow in town who can wriggle himself more handsomely through a thicket of commas and semicolons, or stagger along under a load of big words more stoutly than yourself." Mrs. Stichen and Luther both started at the very idea of any one's daring to chaff so august a personage! Boggs didn't seem to mind it at all. He made a slight gesture of deprecation. "Don't flatter me, Whoppers; you know you're weak in that line, and you recollect what Judge Simpson said about you the other day, in his charge to the Grand Jury: that he could stand anything in the Universe, except flattery.' L   AE VER AGAIN.          279 But, as I was saying, and as I advised Mrs. Stichen, nothing is more dangerous than to drop old acquaintances too suddenly." "Thank you, Mr. Boggs," exclaimed Luther with a smile. Mr. Boggs paused, and gave a look at the speaker, as much as to say, "You are sharper young man than I supposed." You're right, Luther," said Mr. Whoppers, "we are deeply indebted to Boggs." "No, you needn't thank Mr. Boggs," exclaimed the lady. "I defer in general to Mr. Boggs' taste and superior experi- ence, but in some things I decide and judge for myself. I have made up -my mind that in no case will I drop old friends and acquaintances whom I like. But the friends whom I never did like, and the acquaintances whom I always hated and always was willing to get rid of-well, that is different. I don't know why I should put myself out to keep them?" "No reason in the world," said Mr. Whoppers. "The holiest saint that ever attained the entry of fashionable society would let 'em slide in such cases. Cut right and left; never mind a little harshness towards sinners hardened in respecta- bility; and as you say, whom you always did hate." "And as to the others, your friends whom you have really loved," said Mr. Boggs, " it is not only bad taste, but very unnecessary; it is a foolish waste of energy." "You mean, Boggs, that a rising woman has only to live up to the mark of her high calling to get rid of all her social detrimentals, nobodies, and dowdies, and vulgar relations. She don't drop them! Oh no, not a bit of it! They drop her. Well that brings us back, Mrs. Stichen, to your ques- tion and my answer. Five hundred thousand miles from -Bleecker Street, if it is a rod! Don't you see?" L Well, I don't care how far it is, Mr. Whoppers. You and Luther have found that you can walk it of an evening, and I shall expect you to do so very often. I count on you, Luther, at any rate. You have all of your evenings to your- self."   280        NE VER A GAIN. "I shall be most happy," replied Luther. "But I would not have you think me of such idle habits as to have all my evenings disengaged."  "Ah, I see some young lady in the case."    i Luther laughingly protested against that view. Time was too precious to be wasted in that way. "Ah, I forgot ; that fortunp you came to New York to achieve must be had first. And then-well I watched you the other night at the Ledgerals, and I should judge from what I did see, that if there is no young lady who occupies your time, there is one who occupies a good deal of your thoughts. You need not blush so," continued Mrs. Stichen, in a low voice. She might have spoken in a full tone, for the three gentle- men were by this time fully engaged in a discussion of the latest news, which Mr. Stichen had brought up from the street, and particularly the last thing in Erie. "And you really think it would do to sell five hundred shares?" said Mr. Boggs. "Here's Whoppers too, he is al- ways ready to turn an honest penny." 'But I'm a little afraid," replied Mr. Whoppers, "that if there is such a powerful party ready to give it a lift, we may get caught selling short, and I can't afford to lose much. I am master of the Universe it is true, but my means are not in- exhaustible. I am like another celebrated master of the Unli- verse, and willing to cry bonus est odor ex re qualibet, which means, Stichen, that I won't turn up my nose at the smell of a bank-note, no matter where it comes from, but-well I've been astraddle of a bull's horns once ; and once I got a bear's claws clear into my vitals, and I don't want to be clawed or gored again. I musn't do anything to endanger the -Universe, but if you think there is not too much risk?" "That's just it, you see; but mind you, what I say is to go no further. I am  willing to help you, Mr. Boggs, and our friend Whoppers here, but I am not going to tell all I know to everybody.  You see it's just like a trotting match; you don't know the horses, and you know there is going to be cheating, so you take your chance of coming out on the swin-  s   NE VER AGAIN.         281 dlers side. You find out which horse the biggest rascals are ostensibly laying their bets on, and you go your pile against him ; two to one you see your money back. Well, you must know, they came to me and said, 'Stichen, we are going to make a big strong pool, and we want you should go in with us; we count on you for half a million. We are already ten million strong, and we can pry her up twenty per cent. at least. The shorts are pretty deep already, and if we work the thing right, we can take every hair of their hides off. We'll make pious Dan wish he was once more feeding a lot of drovers at the Bull's Head.' And that is just how it stands at pres- ent." "And yet you advise us, Mr. Stichen, to sell short." "Just so. Don't you see; that crowd is composed of some of the most slippery fellows in the street. They think they can humbug me, and make me thiftk that they want to put the stock up, and that I, with others, will rush out and pri- vately load up with fifty-thousand shares or so, and then they will get a rig on the money-market and come in with convert- ible bonds and new issues, and crowd the mourners with over- whelming short sales, and all that, and smash everything and grind a million or two out of their confiding friends and con- federates. But they don't catch me. I shall sell five thou- sand shares to-morrow morning, and if you choose I will put you down for five hundred, Mr. Boggs, and you, Mr. Whop- pers. You won't need any margins, you know," as the two gentlemen hesitated; "I'll take-care of that." a Oh, Stichen, you are too kind," and both gentlemen shook him warmly by the hand. " Oh, not at all. But come now, Mr. Whoppers, I want you should taste a little of March and Benson's I803. Boggs put me on the scent of it. It is the genuine rain water, not another drop of it left in the city. I took the four dozen at forty dollars the bottle. There are a few bottles of it in a Brooklyn cellar, but no money could fetch that," and Mr. Stichen touched the bell. "And I have a dozen of curious sherry, old Stuyvesant wine, a present from the king of Spain   282        NEVER AGA IN. to the Viceroy in '96, and captured and sold at La Guyra years ago. You shall taste both. You, gentlemen, are judges and can appreciate the article, but as for me! I care nothing about either.-Can hardly tell sherry from Madeira. - ather have a glass of Muir or Bass any day. Got in a cask of Bass the other day just for my own drinking. Oh! there is no affecta. tion about me." "That's just my taste, d has all affectation," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "It's horribly low, I suppose our friend Boggs thinks, not to care for March and Benson of I8o3." Mr. Boggs shook his head, "No, I quite approve of Bass under certain circumstances." "You do; adapt your liquor to your company. I sup. pose, you see, Stichen, he thinks this just the occasion for a little of the frothy, that's what ails him. Bring in your Bass; or perhaps Brown stout, if you have any, would better enable us to stand up under so much condescension." The gentlemen were fully occupied at the side-board, and Mrs. Stichen and Luther continued their conversation. "You need not blush so," said the lady. "I admire your taste. I think if I were a young man I should fall in love there myself." "Yes, but it would be very ridiculous for me to do so." "And why would it be ridiculous in you?-you don't hold yourself superior to the universal weakness, do you?" -' Not I," exclaimed Luther laughing; "I expect to be ii love a dozen times, but I am not going to try it on when the thing is certain to be a misfit." -"Well, now, if your friend Whoppers had heard that, he would say that it is just a miss fit that you ought to try. Pity he is so busy talking to Stichen. I'd like to show him that I can make a pun sometimes." "Do you know," continued Mrs. Stichen, "I heard her asl Aunt Shippen what she thought of you; and if you had nol rather good manners ; and if she didn't think that you da&ncec pretty well, and made a good partner for the very younl girls."   NE VER A GAIN.         283 "I am much obliged to her, I am sure, for her good opin- ion, but I don't think that I will trouble her or the young girls again." "Now don't be foolish, Luther. What would you have her say, sly puss that she is? Would you have her fall in ecstasies over your good looks, or your charming manners, or your fine dancing, and just have the doors of the house closed on you forever?" "No," replied Luther, somewhat mollified by the turn Mrs. Stichen had given to Helen's remarks. "No, and yet, why should not the door be closed forever, first as well as last. Whoppers is always dinning it into me, that until I can bridge the golden gulf, or cross the silver sea, there is no hope. And the gulf grows broader, and the sea. wider every day. No, I never mean to take a fancy to any girl, still less try to make any girl take a fancy to me, until I am rich." "What a heartless speech! Luther, I am quite ashamed of you." "Well, it does seem heartless, but it isn't. It is not alone myself that I think of, it is the girl herself. Love in a cottage was all very well in the time of our- grandmothers, perhaps, but it don't do nowadays. No, the first, second, and third requirement for happiness in married life now is money, money, money. I know I shouldn't make a good husband without it, and I should consider myself a reckless rascal to ask any well-brought-up girl of the period to share an unfash- ionable existence with me; to give up, to a great extent, balls, and parties, and the opera, and endure a life of merely re- spectable privation; and finally sink out of sight of her set, beneath the waves of social contempt. No, no, I'd tear my heart out first!" "Why, I had no idea, Luther, that you were such a despe- rate case. You are dead in love with that girl." "Mrs. Stichen!" "Oh, don't be affaid, I'll keep your secret. You shall come up some day when I am alone, and we'll have a little private talk about it. You shall tell me all you think and feel.   284        NE VE t' A GAIA . It will do you good. We' can't say anything more just now they have settled the affair of Erie, and will be joining in ou conversation in a moment. You'll come? Alone?" Luther nodded. "Say next Friday evening?" Luther hesitated. "Oh, he can't go anywhere, or do anything on Frida2 evening!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "That's one of thl evenings that he has to devote to his old woman. Tell Mrs Stichen, Luther, about the old lady. It's quite an adventure.' Both Mr. Boggs and Mr. Stichen expressed great interest as soon as they found that the old lady alluded to was name( Steignitz. "I have never seen her," said Mr. Stichen, "but I have heard them speak of her at the bank. I believe there is no doubt about her having money." "Money!" said Boggs, " why she has piles of it. Very few people ever heard of her, and nobody knows much about her; but it is supposed she has millions. She collects all her dividends and rents herself; has an account in every savings bank in the city. She invests a great deal through Jones, Brothers & Co. I was in there yesterday when they accidentally learned that she was doing the same thing through half-a-dozen other bankers and brokers. You see she had just taken'fifty thousand in Illinois Central bonds, when in rushed Jerry Del- evan and wanted fifty thousand immediately. It's for anold customer, and she is in a hurry, said he. She! said Jories, have you also got a female customer to-day for fifty thousand? Yes, and a funny little old thing she is too. You don't mean it? is she French? said Jones. French or German. Does her name happen to be Steignitz? The very name! And so the whole thing came out. Jones asked her why she did not give them the order for the whole hundred thousand. If you will have the goodness, sir, she replied, to put your corn missions in your pocket, without asking me any unnecessary questions, Bon! if not, I find some other shop.- Think of her talking to Jones in that style. You know Jones: he fancies   NEVER AGAIN.          285 himself high cockalorum up town, as well as down ; and when he puts on his best airs, the President of the United States. might take a lesson in manners. Jerry Delevan swears that she came from Mexico with the proceeds of a gold mine in her pocket, and that he really believes that she can, any day, buy and sell Astor, or Vanderbilt, or Stewart, and throw in Moses Taylor, and Daniel Drew by way of small change." "That is all nonsense," said Mr. Stichen, '; she is proba bly rich, but then you know what women's fortunes are. They are like the fortunes of the chaps who used to come up from the South, or around from California with a grand flourish. First rate to brag on, provided nobody makes a call. Any woman with a hundred thousand is invariably chalked up half a million or more.'" "Well, at any rate our young friend has done a nice thing in getting into the graces of the old lady." "No one knows that better than myself," said Luther. "I have known -her but little more than six months, and I have already pretty much mastered French, and made good prog- ress in German." "I hope she will do better by you than merely a little French and German." "I have no other expectations or wishes," replied Luther, laughing. (' As to her wealth, I don't believe a word of it. She lives so poorly that I was induced to insist one day upon paying a small sum for my lessons. She utterly refused it, but finally she said if I could spare half a dollar, for a few days, as a loan, she would be glad of it, as paying the interest of the mortgage on her house had taken every cent of the rent she had received. She has not been able to return it yet." "I guess he'll get it back again," said Mr. Whoppers. "Don't you think so, Boggs?" "Well, I wish I had half a dollar as well invested as that."5 "You'll not forget your promise to visit me soon again'?" said Mrs. Stichen, extending her hand to Luther as he and Mr. 'Whoppers rose to make their parting salutations. "You   286        NEVERL A GAINS. need not wait for your companion, you know," she whispered. "We can talk over that matter better alone." "The matter is hardly worth talking over, but I am delighted to have your permission to repeat my visit." "Well, well, as you please. Good-night and pleasant dreams, but no walking in your sleep; you might lose your- self in the labyrinth of Washington Square."   CHAPTER XV A Mysterious Deposit--A Hideous Face at the Window-The Captain's Letter--The Inventor--The Old Problem-Freedom of the Will- Inventions and Inventors-The Noiseless Gun-A nice Instrument for a Modern Vehmgericht. LUTHER'S correspondence was not large, in fact it was very seldom that he received a letter, and he knew in a moment the familiar handwriting of his only regular corre- spondent, Captain Combings. He read the letter twice over with the deepest interest, put it in his pocket and hurried to Burling Slip. That afternoon he managed to get away a lit- tle earlier than usual: it was one of the davs of the week on which the Merchants' Clerks' Savings Bank keeps open until evening. Luther thought that he would stop at the bank, make a small deposit, and examine his book, which he had always been in the habit of leaving at the bank. There was something in the Captain's letter that made him desirous of knowing the ex- act amount of his balance. He had a pretty accurate idea, but there had been some interest written in since the last de- posit, and he might as well know the exact figure, which was really getting so large that he had better be looking out for a profitable permanent investment. The prompt and amiable teller received his money, enter- ed it, and then, at Luther's request, handed him the bank-book for him to examine. Luther glanced carelessly through the list of deposits, until it alighted on something very singular at the end; he started, winked his eyes violently, and looked again: could he believe his sight? Yes, there it was, in bold, clear writing.-A credit   288        NEVER A GA INV. of five hundred dollars-the last deposit, made about three weeks before. There must be a mistake! He never had de. posited five hundred dollars; and besides he had not been into the bank for more than a month. He drew his pencil from his pocket, and going to a side desk summed up the whole list of credits. It was some time since his book had been balanced, but he knew to within five dollars what the amount ought to be. Seven hundred and fifty dollars was the extreme that by any possibility he was entitled to. The addition was soon made, and came out twelve hun- dred and fifty; to be sure of his addition he repeated the oper. ation, and then stepping up to the teller's desk, he called that gentleman's attention to the bank-book. "How? What?   Deposits uncredited?- Impossible! Just step to the book-keeper's desk-he will show you." "No, sir ; that is not it. It is a credit -too much. It ap- pears here that on the 4th instant I deposited five hundred dollars. On that day I was not in the bank : I could not have made the deposit." "Sent it by somebody, perhaps?" "No, sir; I hadn't it to send. There must be some mis- take about it." "No mistake, sir; impossible! we don't make mistakes here. It was three weeks ago, and don't you suppose that my cash-account would have shown a mistake of that kind. Be- sides, I recollect that a deposit of that amount was made to your credit." "By whom?" "Can't tell that; recollect the fact only-but perhaps you had better walk into the back room and see our cashier: he may tell you what to do, but I think you will have to keep the money. It certainly don't belong to us." The cashier received the young man with his usual court- esty, and listened with interest to his statement. Here was something new in banking experience: a customer who had more money than he wanted-who was disposed to raise ob'   NE VER4 GA IN.         289 jections to a big balance, and to cut down his own credits below the bank estimates. The cashier took the book and left his room to consult the book-keeper. In a few minutes he returned. "I am afraid it's all right,"' he said smiling. "The money was deposited to your credit on the date assigned." "It could not have been by me. I recollect that I thought of coming here to make a deposit that day, as I had saved up twenty dollars, but, as it was my birthday, I decided to make myself a present of books and to send a few flowers to a friend." "Well, perhaps, as it was your birthday, some friend had decided to make a present to you. Mr. teller thinks that the money was deposited by an elderly gentleman with a white moustache and beard, or else by a young man who looked like a lawyer's clerk. He can't recollect which." Luther rapidly ran over in his mind the few utterly improb- able persons of his acquaintance. He could not help blush- ing, partly at the utter absurdity of the idea, as his thought fluttered for an instant above the image of Helen Ledgeral. What if, on the very day that he was sending her anonymous verses and flowers, she was sending him anonymously a contri- bution towards that fortune he was seeking? It certainly showed a disposition to lessen the distance between them. But nonsense! she would have more delicacy!-how could he do her such injustice? and what a coarse-minded brute he must be to think of --such a thing for an instant: and besides, where would she get five hundred dollars for such a purpose--as soon suspect his impecunious friend Mr. Whoppers. "No," said Luther, "I have no friend who would or could do it." "Well, if it is an enemy," replied the cashier, smiling, "I would advise you to pocket the affront. At any rate we can do nothing more than take care of the money for you." "It is quite mysterious," said one of the clerks, as Luther left the bank. "Not a bit of mystery," replied the paying teller. "The 19   290        NEVER AGA I. thing is as plain as a- counterfeit green-back. Don't you see what a good-looking young fellow he is? Well, there is a woman around somewhere, you may be sure." Luther hurried home, and finding that fIr. Whoppers was in the house, dashed into his room without ceremony. "Look at that," said Luther, as he flung his bank-book on the table where Mr. Whoppers sat writing, and then Luther rapidly told the story of his visit to the bank. "And now who's my friend?" "I can tell you," replied Mr. Whoppers, " it is your old Frenchwoman." "I don't believe it." "She is the only friend you have got who has the ability to do such a thing." " I don't believe it. I doubt both her ability and her dis- position. You persist in calling her rich ;-how the story got around I can't imagine; if you knew her as well as I do, you would see that that idea is ridiculous. But, supposing that he had a little money stowed away, why should she give it to me?" "Why? The Lord knows why. You don't expect me to tell you all the pros and cons of an elderly French female's mind do you? I merely tell you the fact: the money comes from her; you can argue the point for yourself if you please. You've got the data. I haven't. Don't know her. Never have seen her. I suppose you can't ask her plump?" "(Shouldn't like to. But I'll see if I can't bring her to book in a roundabout way to night." At his usual hour Luther mounted the dark, rickety stairs of the house in Wooster Street, and tapped at the door of Madame Steignitz' room. Madame's sharp eyes fairly gleamed with pleasure as she unbolted the door and welcomed him in voluble French.. For some weeks now the conversation had been wholly in French, hardly a word in English. Under her capital system of in- struction, Luther had acquired such a mastery of the language, that when running on in the full flood of personal gossip, en-   NVE VER A GAIN.        291 livened by funny ,anecdotes and minute details of personal adventure, Madame never felt the slightest temptation to eke out her meaning, or assist Luther's comprehension by a single word outside of her own native tongue. The instruction in German to which the first hour of the evening was always devoted, was rigorously filtered through French; after that an hour's-more frequently two hours' talk. Madame had grown much more communicative than at first. She seemed rather to like talking now about herself than not. She told Luther all about her early life. How she had gone to Germany as a bonne in attendance upon the chil- dren of a noble family. That she had gone through the de- grees of lady's maid, and governess, and had lived in Italy, and in Spain, as maitresse de son propre menage. Of her hus- band she did not seem disposed to say much. "C'etait un honmmne dur; but he is dead-died at gt. Louis, and left us some little money and the house in Wooster Street; just enough to keep us from starving." Luther could see that her thoughts were fluttering around the memory of some other and dearer object of her affections, but she never gave them a voice until one evening when Luther unwittingly provoked, by a direct question, a scene which he never wanted to see repeated. "You say us." He said, "who do you mean by us?" Madame Steignitz sank back in her chair as if struck by a heavy blow. "Oh, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!" she moaned, "why did you suffer it! why did you afflict me so heavily!- why should I lose my only one; my joy! my pride! Is there no mercy in heaven!" Starting up from her chair, a gleam of ferocity in her eyes, she began pacing up and down the room. "You ask the meaning of us! It means I and my child, my beautiful child! my brave boy! my only one! all, all I had on earth! swept away instantly! snatched from me and swallowed up by that dark, ravenous, cursed stream-and I not to know where in the foul Mississippi mud his bones lie bur-, ied!" She continued her walk, wringing her hands one minute,   292        NE YEIR A GAINV. and the next throwing them abroad in t ie wildest gesticula. tion. "I loved him so-better than my life! yes better than Heaven. I loved him so much that God got jealous of him. But oh! he was so beautiful, so brave, so strong, and the cursed river ravished even his breathless body from me. Oh, mon Dieu, mon Dieu! if I had found his body ;-if I only had his little grave, that I could lay my head upon it, and kiss the soil, and heap it with flowers! "Yes," she continued, "he looked like you. The same eyes, the same hair ; and he, too, if he had been spared, would have grown tall and strong." She advanced to Luther and passed her delicate little fin- gers -through the masses of hair curling round his brow,- and suddenly clasping his head with both hands, gave him two or three convulsive kisses on the forehead. "Forgive me!" she exclaimed. "Forgive a foolish old woman for giving way to her feelings sometimes; 'tisnot often; my nerves are good; it shall be the last time. Have no fear; I will not frighten you again." Since that scene she had never alluded to her child, and Luther had been careful not to say anything that might, how- ever indirectly, lead to the subject. The hour devoted to German had nearly passed, and Lu- ther was marking the concluding passage, when happening to raise his eyes to one of the dormer-windows he saw something that startled him-a man's face pressed closely against the glass, and peering intently into the room. It was but a glimpse, the next instant it was gone. But that glimpse was strong enough to stamp the impression clearly upon Luther's mind. There was something familiar in the expression of the face, could it be that he had ever encountered the owner of that hideous countenaace. The thick masses of black hair that bristled out from beneath a low fur cap, the glaring eyes, the coarse red skin, the heavy, close-cut moustache and beard, certainly belonged to none of his acquaintance, and yet it flashed upon him that he had seen these before.   NE VER A GAIN.   .     293 Luther hesitated for an instant through sheer surprise, and then grasped Madame Steignitz by the shoulder. "Quoi! Qu'avez vous!" she demanded, quite startled ip turn by Luther's evident excitement. "Did you see that?" he demanded. "What? I saw nothing." "A man's face looking in at the window."  No : it can't be.' "I saw it distinctly, an ugly fellow in a cap. He poked his head around from that side." "Oh, bah! your eyes deceive you; 'twas nothing but a flash of light as you looked up from your book. I think yout read too much." Luther shook his head and rising crossed to the window and threw up the sash. There was nothing strange in sight. Two feet below him ran the gutter, and below that he could see down into the grimy court, partly lighted from the back- room windows of the thickly-peopled houses on either side. He jumped up and seated himself on the window-sill, and holding on to the sash bent backward until he could take a view up along the roof on either side. There was nothing suspicious in sight. The examination was not wholly satisfactory, for the roofs of the neighboring houses were continuous, and although not half a minute had elapsed since he had seen the man's head, there was a possibility that the owner might have reached the concealment of a neighboring dormer-window. He had half a mind, despite Madame's entreaties, to get out and search the roofs of the row. But the slates were damp and slippery, and in clambering about he might frighten honest people and be taken for a burglar himself. "Bah! if it is a robber," exclaimed Madame, "what do I care? He won't disturb me. I've got nothing for-him. They know I'm poor. Everybody knows I've not got so much as five cents in this room, and who would take the trouble to rob an old woman of these rags and broken things? Come in and shut the window. You will catch nothing but a big cold."   \294       NE VE R A GAIN. Luther jumped down and closed the window. There was a loose catch, but nail-holes over the lower sash showed that somebody in former times had not felt so secure against intrusion as the present occupant. Madame had no nails, so Luther split up a piece of kindling-wood, and whittled out a peg that would answer the purpose for the moment. It was some little time before the young man quite re. covered his composure. It was difficult to get rid of the ima. pression that the man's face had made upon him. That it was a man's face he felt quite confident, and yet there was a possibility that it was a product of his own brain. Everybody had stories, too, of the illusions of disordered vision. There was the fellow that had the big yellow dog always following around after him ; and there was the chap that whenever he went to draw a bucket of water always saw an Indian chief in feathers and war-paint, jump out of the well and hide him. self in the wood-pile. Perhaps he was getting a little dys- peptic-stomach out of order maybe, without his knowing it. Well, he would not read quite so late at nights, and he would not eat so many buckwheat cakes in the morning. "Do you know, Madame," he said, "I've had a queer thing happen to me to-day, and I admit that it may have put my nerves in something of a flutter," and Luther pulled his bank-book out of his pocket. The old lady listened with great interest to Luther's ac- count of his discovery at the bank, but uttered no expression that allowed him an opportunity for a direct question. It would have been easy to accuse her in a joking tone, but Luther's sense of delicacy forbade it. She was so very poor, that is, sup- posing the stories about her wealth to be fictions, that any joking on such a subject might look like ridicule. The near- est approach that he allowed himself was a reply to her won- dering question-Who could it be? "I can't imagine; I have turned over in my mind the idea of everybody whom I know, without being able to hit upon a probability; I might as well suppose it came from you as any one."   -NE VER A GAIN.        295 Madame Steignitz indulged in a hearty, and, as Luther thought, an unaffected laugh, at the utter absurdity of such an idea. "Well, it is a perfect God-send, wherever it came from. It brings my bank-account hard on to fifteen hundred dollars, and I have just now an occasion for that sum." "Oh! you make an investment; what you buy? some stocks or bonds? I know something of that thing. My hus- band, oh! he buy and sell a great many things in St. Louis." "No, neither stocks nor bonds: I am going to put it into a ship, or rather I am going to loan it to a friend to put in a ship." "No, no, put it in a ship yourself; that is not so bad. I had a little money in a ship myself once; but do not lend it. Who it is who wants to borrow your money?" "No one wants to borrow, but I want to lend; and I am by no means sure that the loan will be accepted. I have re- ceived a letter to-day from my friend Captain Combings, whom you have heard me speak about so often." "Ah! yes, the brave old sailor-read me his letter." Luther got up, went across the room to his overcoat, took the letter from the pocket and returned to his seat, not with- out casting a suspicious glance at the windows. It seemed as if he must see that face still at the pane. "It will not be long now, my dear Luther, a few days at most," wrote Captain Combings, " before I shall have an op- portunity of giving you a hail. I hope to find you as willing to back your main topsail as I am. I do long so to see you once more. I want to see for myself how you carry your can- vas. I want to overhaul your log a little. Although you have kept me pretty well informed, there are some things which I don't fully understand. That French craft you have fallen afoul of! are you sure she is all sound? No buts started anywhere, and enough ballast in her hold?" "Oh, mon Dieu; mon Dieu!" interrupted Madame; "what a language that of the sea!" "And is there no other craft with finer lines and a cleaner   296        NEVEVR AGAIN. run, and a newer set of sticks, and more top-hamper that has crossed your course? Oh, fill away with you now! can't I see with half an eye how hard you brace up on that tack? In all your letters you have never mentioned the Helen but twice, and do you suppose an old quartermaster can't see when the leach of a sail is shivering in the wind? Dyce--dyce- No nigher; ease her up a spoke or two or you'll have every. thing aback, you son of a gun! "But to leave off sailor lingo, my dear Luther, I am right glad of the prospect of meeting you, and I am not sorry to bid good-bye to these miserable inland seas forever. The weather on Ontario is as bad as it is on the North Atlantic, and you are so cramped for sea-room, that you can't scud for an hour, unless the wind blows up and down the lake, -without chucking your spars into their native forests; you can't lay to for half an hour without wishing you were five miles to windward of Sable Island or Nantucket Shoals, and you can't make for a harbor without getting on some miserable spit or bar. "That has just been my case. I was bound down the lake to Ogdensburg: the weather was thick and squally; the wind shifting every five minutes, and coming out in puffs that played about as big tunes with our old rotten rigging as I care to listen to. I knew by midnight the air would be full of broomsticks, and a witch on every one of 'em. However, I managed to get the miserable, worn-out, ill-found thing dclown to the mouth of the Oswegatchie, which makes the harbor of Ogdensburg. I had just rounded up, with my sheets hauled aft, and was standing in by the old French trading-house point, when along came a puff-not much to speak of consid- ering I was only showing the head of my foresail-but crack went the mast short off by the board, and up went her head into the wind, and before I could cut clear of the spar she gathered stern-way and backed right down upon the, bar.

I am five or six hundred dol- lars ahead-that's mighty little towards getting a command in a decent sea-going craft, but perhaps I may get an interest in some old sloop on the river. If not, why I will take the berth of mate, althou'gh it is a little hard for a mnan who knows the ropes, and who has always cocked his hat on his own quarter- deck skipper-wise, to come down to bossing a ship's watch as A first or second officer. "Expect me then about Wednesday next. When I hope I shall have a better opportunity of telling you how much delight your success in business matters, your improvement, bodily and mental, and your good steady habits, have given to the heart of the old sailor, your friend." Luther finished the letter, and Madame Steignitz sat for some time silent, with her elbows on her knee, and her chin in her hand. "That Captain, I think, is a good man," she said at length. "Good!" said Luther. "Why he is the best of men. He is perfectly lovely; a regular angel," and Luther launched out on a current of magniloquent talk in praise of the Captain's manifold merits and virtues. Any one listening to him would -have got the idea that the Captain was also a handsome man. On which point however, there could be no doubt that Lu- ther's enthusiasm carried him a little too far. "And you are going to lend your money to him?" de- manded Madame Steignitz. "'Well, you see it is almost impossible for a man who has not been to sea for some time, and who has no personal friends among ship-owners, to get a command, unless he has monby enough to make him part owner. Now the Captain has got five hundred -dollars, and I have got fifteen hundred;   298        NE VER A GA IN. that makes two thousand. That is not much, but it will buy a share in an old brig that I know of. She belongs to our firm: the captain now in command wants to sell out his share, and quit the sea. Captain Combings can step into his shoes. It is not a very splendid thing. The brig is old and a perfect tub, they say, but she has been running, pretty regularly, for sugar and molasses for the last twenty years. Such a good man and such a splendid seaman as the Captain ought to have a first-rate ship, and something better to do than carry- ing cargoes of cockroaches between here and Matanzas." "Do you know of any such ship?" asked Madame. "Why I know of half a dozen. There is the. Spoondrift--a splendid ship; half clipper; twelve hundred tons; her own- ers have put her up for Australia, and she is half full of lumber and Yankee notions. There is a quarter of her to be bought, but it would take ten thousand dollars." "You think it is cheap?" "Very cheap ; she is worth every cent of sixty thousand; but then we can't think of that." "I don't know; I don't know. Let me think! I am a very poor woman. I have nothing lbut this house with the mortgage, but you see it is a good house; not so far from Broadway. I think they will let me have some more money upon it. Perhaps something can be done for your brave  friend. You have fifteen hundred: the Captain has five hun- dred. Now if I raise eight thousand on this house, that will make the ten thousand. We buy the share for the Captain, and then the Captain puts the share in my name. I be well secured, eh? And I get enough money from the ship to pay my interest. What you say, eh?" Luther, at first, did not know what to say. How could he allow the old lady to take so much trouble and perhaps risk? But then he could not but be struck at her shrewdness in pro- posing to take the whole of the share in her own name. "At eight thousand it would certainly be a safe and a good thing for her--ten per cent. at least. And perhaps after all they are right, and the old woman is rich, and may have the money on nand I    NE VER A GAI- V.       299 Luther hesitated. "Well, well, perhaps nobody will let me have the money on the mortgage. We will see; we will see. You find out all about the ship, and see if you cannot get the share for nine thousand, or nine thousand five hundred. You know 'tis very bad property now." As Luther took his leave, the image of that hideous- face and those glaring eyes came to his mind, and he felt really alarmed' at the idea of the old lady's lonely and unprotected condition. Perhaps there was nothing to fear from a robber, but what if the roof-hunting demon should turn out to be ah escaped maniac? It would, however, do no good to broach the idea to Madame. She wouldn't believe that he really had seen a man's head at the window, and, after all, it was well not to excite useless fears. He could do nothing better than bid her good-night. Stepping across the landing, Luther tapped at the door of Mr. Planly. For he had been in the habit of looking in, after his lessons, upon the old inventor, sometimes for a passing salutation, sometimes for a long hour's chat. Luther was of an inventive turn himself, and his evident sympathy had lifted the forlorn old genius out of his habitual shyness and reserve. It was a pleasure which hitherto he had known nothing of-this contact with a young fresh and active mind. To hear the voice of commendation and en- couragement outside of himself, and apart from and yet in unison with the whisperings of his own brain; to be able to pour out into eager ears the tale of his hopes and disappoint- ments, and struggles; to unfold his plans, and display his drawings and models to an eye sparkling with interest and capable of seizing almost instantaneously the minutest me- chanical details,-was a pleasure new and intense. He had fought the world at a disadvantage so long; had had so many falls, had been buried so deeply under heaps of gibes and jests; had had his heart so seamed and scarred by the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune; that he had abandorned all hope of the battle almost all desire for a successful rally.   300        NE VER AGA IN. And now here was a friendly cheer ringing over the waste of dead and dying aspirations; and he felt his nerves tingle, and his heart jump, and his cold blood warm again, as he listened to the joyful sound. "How is it," demanded Luther, " that you have pushed so few of your inventions into practical use, and how is that those that have been adapted have brought you so little money?" "There are two reasons," replied Mr. Planly. "One is the want of business talent; an extreme distaste for anything in the way of chaffering and bargaining, and an utter inca- pacity to resist a rebuff or to fight nly way against anything that touches my pride-morbid pride if you will. Oh, I have analyzed myself; I know just how weak I am, when I really look into myself. Generally I call it pride, and am rather proud of it; generally I humbug myself, as people of my stamp often-do, with notions of personal dignity and self-re- spect; but really at times-and this is one of them, and I am going to make a confession-at times, I say, I see myself as I really am-vain, weak, silly, with a sickly sensitiveness that would disgrace a chlorotic girl." "Oh,'" said Luther deprecatingly, "your mode of life may, have a good deal to do with all such notions. You study too hard, think too much, and work too steadily; and then you don't take proper exercise!" "Or food either, you might add. Well, well, I am as I am. I am the product of the circumstances under and into which I am born. I can't help being myself. I have cast off all belief in free will and moral responsibility. Given a form like this and a brain like this"-touching his forehead- "Iarge in front and, small behind-big reflective organs and no sustaining powers-too much of the intellectual and not enough of the animal-give such a being a feeble volition and chuck him helpless into an environment like mine; and, at the end of sixty years, what is the product? Why H am the necessary and inevitable result. And who's to blame, pray? Am I? am I to blame because under different circum-   NE VER A GAIN.         301 stances, with a different body and a different temperament, and another-mind and heart and soul, I might have been no longer H might have been somebody else? I won't admit it. Suppose that ally accident had foiled my mother's gesta- tory cares; would I have been held responsible for the failure of my antenatal existence? No! And why more for this miserable abortion of threescore years? No, I cannot admit it. I cannot give up my only consolation for a life of suffer- ing and failure-my only justification to myself-my only ground for hope that in the great hereafter the power that made me will, upon the principle of compensation, do a little better by me. "This is horrible doctrine, I know," continued Mr. Planly. "You don't hear anything like it in the churches; but it won't do you any harm, and it does me good to blow off a lit- tle. I would not convert you to my way of thinking. I would not convert anybody to anything. If I had Samson's strength and his powerful weapon in my hand, I might feel called upon lo fight the Philistines a little. But let the world wag. - What is Hecuba to me or I to Hecuba-besides it is not meet 'That he who guides amiss his petty-barque Should undertake the helm of social order.' "And if I should go to the wheel, what guaranty have I that I should serve my trick out, or that I should succeed in steering the craft into smooth water. "The fatal facility of change," continued Mr. Planly after a short pause-"Ah! that's it. Young man, look at me, and take warning. The proverb of the rolling stone is applied generally to changes of external occupations; it will apply equally well to a futile versatility in our mental operations. I have always been an inventor. Nothing has seduced me from or disgusted me with the calling; so far I have been per- sistent. But within that calling what a want of persistency and stability-what an absence of tenacity of idea and steadi- ness of purpose! Oh, I know myself; I know tmyself. No sooner, after infinite labor and thought, do I see an idea or   302        NE VER A GA ,IN. thing approaching completion or perfection than I become disgusted with it--can't bear it-turn away from it-drop it out of my thought. Now is this the result of bad training and evil mental habits, or is it a radical and congenital defect in the organization of my brain ?" Mr. Planly paused and looked at Luther as if expecting a reply. "I am not physiologist or psychologist enough to answer that," said Luther. " But," continued Mr. Planly, " I am getting too far away from your question, why I haven't been able to carry out any of my inventions. Of course no one knows better 'than my- self that many of them   are good for nothing practically. Many of them are ingenious devices for doing what can be done more cheaply or more conveniently in other ways, or what is perhaps not worth doing at all. In some, I am wrong in principle, or utterly mistaken in the adaptation of means to ends, and have in consequence spent a good deal of time and thought that a wiser or better educated man might have saved.    Any inventor is liable to- this, especially one whose nind rambles over a wide field, and who fondles in desultory thought a thousand objects of devotion, instead of sticking to one. But still I have hit upon some things that are good, and that ought to be tried, and upon many that have been ap- propriated, or have since been invented, by others and are  now in use. "And now," resumed Mr. Planly after a pause, " I will tell you the second, and I hope the greatest reason for my failure to carry out into general practice any of my more im- portant inventions, and that is want of money; or, to put it a little more truly, hard, grinding poverty. Materials, models, experiments, skilled labor, all cost money, and sometimes a good deal of money. But suppose that an inventor, by hali starving himself, going half clad, and working night and day, with his own hands, succeeds in getting his idea developed into drawings and models, and even goes so far unaided as to secure his patents, how is he to move a step beyond ? How  NE VER A GA IN.        303 is he to make a capitalist distinguish him in his old rusty hat, faded thread-bare coat, and worn-out shoes, amid the crowd of projectors and charlatans that beseige a rich man's door. If he had plenty of money! Ah, then the thing would be easy enough. Everybody has so much more confidence in the judgment and disinterestedness of a man with money. He can get along without their help--why shouldn't they help him? And to a great extent I believe they are right. Money ballasts a man's intellect or rather it anchors him down, and he merely swings at his moorings, without entirely floating off with every turn of the tide. And then if an inven- tor with money wants to interest a capitalist, why he can at- tack the animal in his den, armed cap-a-pie, in gleaming habil- iments, from his shiny latest style beaver, down to his polished n.v ^ boots; or he can get him into the club or Del- monico's; gorge him with turtle and champagne; and when his pores are fairly open, force in any idea that he wishes; even if it is some new modification of the rotatory system; some grand project for an elevated railroad, or some wonderfully simple plan for a few hundred horse power hot-air engine.' Mr. Planly stopped for a moment in his plaintive tirade, and Luther turned to some of the models and drawings hang- ing upon the walls or lumbering up the rickety shelves. There was a complicated affair for utilizing the enormous power of the waves, and converting their irregular action into an avail- able working force by means of a system of gigantic pumps sending the water to an elevated reservoir inland, whence it returned in a continuous fall to the sea. " The idea is not new," said Mr. Planly ;, "but a practical plan for working it out- has not before been suggested." There was a design for transferring the strain of the cables of a ship at anchor from the hawse-holes to a point or points underneath the water and nearer in a line with the centre of gravity of the ship. "You see, said Mr. Planly, "  in the usual plan, the action of the cable is in a great part to pull a ship's head down into the water and increase the power of the waves. You see here,  304        NEVE VR AGAIN. by means of this traveller running on an iron bar, I let down a short scope of heavy chain to a bolt or hook let in on either side of the stem almost on a level with the keel. The other end of this chain has this kind of stopper. You get your cable out of the hawse-hole, pass it into this stopper, then let your cable slide through the stopper as far as you wish--then let go the short grip-chain and the stopper seizes the cable and holds it tight. Now veer away a little more cable, and the strain is at once transferred from the hawse-hole to a point ten or fifteen feet below the water-line, and if you please to two points, as many feet aft of the stem as may be thought proper. Any eye can see how much more easily a ship would ride. A little calculation will show at least thirty-five or forty per cent. gain. Don't you see?" Luther did see it very clearly. "And when you weigh anchor you heave in as usual until your stopper comes up, cast it off, haul up your traveller and grip-chain and take it on board; or if you want to veer away a large scope of chain suddenly, as for instance a ship sagging down upon you in a crowded roadstead, all you have to do is to pull on this small rope that goes down to the bolt in your submarine stopper and away your cable runs." "I wish my friend Captain Combings was here," said Luther. "He'd like this, I know." "He might not think much of it here," replied Mr. Planly; "but if he was riding, with his spars and sails gone, to a heavy sea and with sharp rocks under his lee I rather think it would suit him." "And what may this be?" demanded Luther, pointing to a curious complication of towers and long, low arched buildings. "Oh, that is my improved brick-kiln. You see two-thirds of the expense of making bricks is in burning them, and at least nine-tenths of the fire used is utterly wasted. Now, it is perfectly astonishing the amount of ingenuity that has been directed to the invention and improvement of brick, machines, but hardly a step has been made towards saving of waste of   NEVER AGAIN.          305 fuel and the enormous loss from the imperfect burning of pale brick and the over-burning of arch brick." Mr. Planly went on to explain how he proposed to employ the heat of one kiln in partially cooking the bricks in a second kiln and even a third, and baking them all to one color, but as the female reader may be supposed to care nothing for bricks, unless it may be the perfect brick of a society-man, and the male reader to know nothing of the subject except a slight knowledge of an occasional " brick in the hat " we will turn with Luther to other subjects.- "What is that?" said Luther. "Oh, that is a magnetic sounding-lead. You see a great many ships are lost from neglect of the lead, wand captains fre- quently won't sound, because of the trouble or delay of heaving to or slowing up. Now, with that, a captain can sit in his cabin and read off at any moment, when on soundings, the depth of water below him with perfect accuracy without deadening his way. The soundings on our coast are so regular that there is no excuse for any captain not knowing his distance from land in the thickest fog." "And what is that combination of circles, or parts of circles?" "Oh, that is an attempt to make an instrument for working out mechanically observations for time at sea. You see here are two meridian circles connected by an equator, and this is a diagonal or zenith-distance circle. Now, you know your latitude, and you clamp one end of your zenith-distance circle to your latitude on the meridian. You observe the altitude of the sun above the horizon--subtract that from ninety, and you have the zenith distance of the sun. Set this movable pin on this diagonal circle at that distance-then separate your meridian circles until this pin corresponds to the decli- nation of the sun marked on the movable meridian circle- read off the number of degrees, on the equatorial circle, that the two meridian circles are apart, and you have the distance of the sun from your meridian, or in other words the differ- ence in time from i2 o'clock, or the true time where you are."   o306        NE VER A GAIN. "And what use would such an instrument be?" demanded Luther. "Not much, only there are a few captains so stupid or so ignorant that they can't be depended upon to work out their observations in the usual way; or so lazy that they -vn't take the trouble to work out more than one observation at a time. If they had an easy mechanical means there might be some- times great errors avoided." -"I recollect," said Luther, "that in our conversation the other night you promised to show me your plans for ventila- ting rail-cars and doing away with the dust." "Oh, don't broach that subject so late in the evening if you desire any sleep to-night. Once upon that I never let up. To do away with noise and dust in railroad travelling would perhaps contribute more to human health and happiness and encourage travelling and increase dividends more than any mechanical implement ever devised. Luckily I have neither model nor drawings here at this moment and you are saved. Some other time! some other time!" and Mr. Planly nodded his head emphatically. Let us rejoice in Luther's lucky escape, as it enabled him to turn rapidly in succession to numerous small articles inithis museum of inventions. There were surgical instruments that attracted his notice-among them what Mr. Planly called, painless knife. It consisted of a hollow stem with a little cir cular knife that could be made to revolve several thousane times a minute by means of a crank turned by an assistant; nc matter how slow the stroke of the operator, the knife woul( make its cut with the rapidity of lightning. There was ai ingenious instrument for superseding the awful operations of Lithotomy and Lithotrity, enabling the surgeon to seize  calculus, enclose it in a little silken bag and then subject it t{ the action of strong acids. "Has it ever been tried?" demanded Luther. "No, I have never been able to get- exactly the righ kind of tissue for holding the acid, but I am satisfied tha it can be made. Many years ago I was full of the subject   NE VER A GA IN.         307 but alas! the time soon comes when the slightest obstacle knocks anything out of my head, and I have to turn to some- thing else." "And are these for surgical purposes also?" said Luther, iricking up some curiously shaped india-rubber articles. "Yes, those are for treating wounds and sores of all kinds Kn different kinds of gas or in perfectly pure air. You know that a great deal of the bad conduct of wounds and ulcers and diseases of the skin comes from the irritation ,and malignant action of impure air-air loaded with poisonrous gases or vapors or infinitesimal seeds of parasitic vegetation- like hospital gangrene for instance. Now, suppose you have a bad stump after an operation, you clap this on to the leg, press the top dowid and exclude the air: now raise it and in rushes the gas from a reservoir of carbonic acid or of the vapor of some hydro-carbon or of pure nitrogen. You keep the wound or sore in this bath of gas long enough to kill all animal or vegetable life, and then drive out the gas and fill up from a reservoir of filtered common air. In this way all kinds of action-purifying, stimulating, soothing, deodorizing, and dis- infecting may be had by the local application of therapeutic agencies hitherto very much neglected. What will be the exact results, of course I don't know, and I don't think the Doctors know much better. It will take a long course of experiment to determine. "But here is something that' I have the greatest hopes from," continued Mr. Planly, pulling out a large drawing rep- resenting something like a large box or small room with human figures in it. "This is my plan for an operating-room that will enable the surgeon to perform all operations, espe- cially those opening into. the important cavities of the human body, in an atmosphere of innocuous gas or in filtered air-air absolutely pure and entirely free from the germs of poisonous ferments, which are unquestionably the source of so much trouble-the cause of so much danger and death." Mr. Planly stopped short: as he was about to launch out into an explanation a heavy step was heard on thj stairs.   308        NEVER AG.4INV. The.inventor started. "Ah ! I had forgotten," he exclaimed, "that I had an appointment." Luther rose to go, but before he could reach the door, it was opened, and a short, active man strode into the-room. A soft wide-brimmed felt hat, slouched over his eyes, con- cealed the upper part of his face;-a heavy black beard and moustache completely masked the lower part;-a hleavy cloak, thrown with theatrical effect, covered up his person. Luther, whose quick fancy had been cultivated in the melo-dramnatic line by frequent attendance at the opera, and by a course of Byron and Bourcicault, was struck with the bandit style of the gentleman, and almost expected him to begin in a deep bari- tone. The bravo, or conspirator, or whoever he might be, advanced into the room without stopping to close the door. Luther, who had been concealed by the open door, quietly slipped out of the room unperceived, but not until he had heard the stranger say in good English, but with a foreign accent, and in a voice that Luther recognized as having heard before, -"I am here in time. Well, I have found a room for you, and have taken it for a year ;-closed the bar- gain at once. You can remove there as soon as you please. We'll get rid of this French devil who wants her rent so regu- larly." "I am a little sorry now, you have taken the room," replied Mr. Planly.  I don't know that I want to move from here." "You will have to move-you can't help yourself-the old woman will turn you out, and we want you away-out of this-at once! We shall have the sheriff in, and all our things seized before we know it; and besides something may happen to the old woman, and as you are her nearest neigh- bor, and known to be in her debt, you will be suspected, and may get into a good deal of trouble." Mir. Planly's reply was made in so low a tone that Luther could not catch a word of it. He would have liked to stop and listen. His curiosity was aroused, but not to a sufficient    NEV'ER AGAIV.         309 degree to overmaster his self-respect. By merely pausing at the door he could easily overhear the continuation of the conversa ion. But no, he would not do it. It had been laid down in every novel that he had ever read, that eavesdrop- ping was ungentlemanly, and above all things Luther wanted to be able to think himself a gentleman. Of course he couldn't stop his ears. He couldn't help hearing what he had heard, and he couldn't help wanting to hear more-but he could take himself off, and not bother himself any more about what ought to have no interest for him. He was how- ever sensible of a sense of mystery. No foundation for it, to be sure, but still it was creeping over him, and contrary to his usual custom, he unconsciously began to slip noiselessly down the stairs. As he opened the street door, the back of a man leaning against the railing was turned towards him. Something in the figure seemed familiar, and it flashed upon Luther that this was the same man whom he had seen awaiting the bandit gentleman above, on a former visit to Mr. Planly. D "Well, they hunt in couples, it seems," muttered Luther; "but what the game is I can't imagine. It can't be that they are after that ridiculous toy, the noiseless gun--Planly calls it a toy, but he seems very much interested in it, and goes -somewhere out of town often to experiment. And how quickly he turned the subject when I asked a question about it! What if it shouldn't be a toy! It would be a dangerous weapon in the hands of some folks. By George, I did not think of that! What would some of the Reds in Europe give for a weapon that would kill at a thousand yards without noise and without smoke." In an instant Luther's active fancy whisked him over the sea, and seated him in some sombre subterranean council- chamber of a modern Vehmgericht. The judgment is passed; some crowned assassin of liberty must die. Luther is ap- pointed executioner. The noiseless gun is put into his hands. In some quiet mansard, that has an outlook upon the palace, he sits and squints along his telescopic sights at the favorite   310        ArE VER A GA IN. window; a short, heavy, fish-eyed, squash-skinned mart makes his appearance with his opera-glass in his hand; Luther pulls trigger-no noise! no smoke! the simple ping of the bullet: and the cut-throat of liberty--the garroter of progress,- the vampire sucking out the vitality of a great nation,-the big. gest humbug and impostor in Europe is dead. And Luther viciously jerked his night-key into the lock of Miss Jones' boarding-house in Bleecker Street.

Why, Luther, how you have spread,since I left you. [should hardly know you. Let me see. Draft about the tame, but a good deal more beam ; none .too much however- just enough to keep from rolling too deep in a heavy swell: and your spars straight and well stayed, and everything alow ind aloft trim and tidy. Why, Luther, I don't believe there's anything that sails in petticoats that wouldn't be proud of you for a consort. If I were building a clipper I'd get you to sit for the figure head." We hope the reader recognizes in the speaker Captain Combings, who with his honest rubicund face fairly glow- ng with delight, and his hearty voice vibrating with affection- ate feeling, was shaking the young man's hand. Luther was equally delighted to see his old friend, and re- turned his grasp warmly. A short conversation, and it was decided to summon Miss Jones and see if she had not a va- cant room which would serve the Captain for the few days that he expected to remain. Miss Jones had nearly finished her morning duties as pre- siding genius of the tea-urn and coffee-pot, and responded readily to the summons. If there was anything in her busi- ness that she really liked it was giving audience to the numer- ous applicants for rooms, especially when the applicants were gentlemen, and above all when the applications were made in the morning. Miss Jones, thanks to a good digestion, an   312         NEVER AGAIN. easy conscience, and the punctual payment of her butcherhs and grocer's bills, slept well and she was conscious of a greater freshness in the morning. She knew that her eyes were brighter, her complexion clearer and her curls more crisp than after the drag of the day. She knew that everybody is from half an inch to an inch taller in the morning than in the afternoon; and an envy of tall women was one of her weak. nesses. She knew that that morning costume was her strong point-that jaunty little breakfast-cap, with purple ribbons; that pretty little collar and chemisette of the finest material, and perfectly plain, except an embroidered monogram of D. B. J., with cuffs to match; that neatly fitting robe of tinted cash- mere trimmed, and turned up with purple satin! Oh, she knew, cunning Miss De Belvoir Jones! she knew there wasn't a woman in the house who didn't abuse her and her dress in the most outrageous manner, and she was perfectly satisfied. Miss Jones had never forgotten that the handsome young man who always paid his board-bills so punctually had once called her " dear maid," in verse, and she was always ready to do anything for Luther that lay in her power. In fact her at- tentions were at times, as Luther thought, a little too strong- ly marked: nothing but his determined preference for the drumstick prevented his plate from being heaped every day with the parson's bit and side-bones; and as to his tea, he had to insist upon sweetening it himself. He could never trust his cup to the tender mercies of Miss Jones' sugar-tongs. Miss Jones " had a vacant room: was exceedingly happy that she had a vacant room. Recollected the Captain per- fectly; would be pleased to receive him, if only for a week; hoped however that she might have the pleasure of his conm pany for a longer time. He would no doubt be pleased with her house and her boarders, as she entertained none but gen- teel people, in fact the genteelest kind of people." "Oh, don't mention it, my dear Miss Jones," exclaimed the Captain, bowing and smiling with a certain suave and defer- ential benignity, truly charming, " don't mention it. I haven't the least objection to genteel people, in fact I like 'em except ------------p-    NEVER AGAIN.          313 when they are a little too genteel; and that sometimes happens, you know, as in the case of Ben Hutching's wife- ' So she up with the broomstick and made him squeal, Heave and pall, Heave and pall, Ok! she is so sweet and so bloody genteel, Heave and pall, Heave and pall.'" Miss Jones stared at the Captain for a few moments in si- lence, and then quietly led the way to the room in question. It proved to be comfortable and convenient, and in everything ready for immediate occupation. Miss Jones listened to his compliments, evidently pleased, but unquestionably astonished. Here was a new kind of mon- ster-a sea monster, a veritable monster-a monster who, in his rage, could evidently seize a woman and choke all her vol- ubility right out of her. Now Miss Jones never had had her volubility checked, not to say choked, but she was dis- posed to exclaim with Trinculo, "a most delicate monster,' or rather with Stephano: "The poor monster is my subject and he shall not suffer indignity." She blushed a little, courtesied lower than usual, but went quietly to her room, and sat ruminating for some time, and finally made up her mind to acdd some side dishes to her bill of fare. "Duff" was simple, she could accomplish that; but could an unacustomed cook rise at once to the heights of that most mysterious nautical dish, " lobscouse?" "What a very nice, well-built craft," observed the Captain as Miss Jones left the room. "Haven't seen anything with neater lines and a cleaner run in a long time." "Don't you think" said Luther, laughing, "that she is a little too broad in the bows?" "Well, perhaps she is, and a little mite too full in the counter, and she doesn't tumble home in the waist as much as some of them  they build nowadays: but do you know Luther, I like that. She sails well, don't she?" "Well, she sails pretty close to the wind, some of her passengers think," replied Luther; "but I make allowance for   31 4       NAriE VEBR , GA IA'. her: any woman in a boarding-house has to lay pretty close, or she will be among the breakers before she knows it?" "That's it, that's it," said the Captain; "give her sea i room and I've no doubt she'd be a comfortable, weatherly craft. I wonder no skipper has applied for the command, eh?"  "Well, I have no doubt there have been applications, but you know how it is yourself: it isn't so easy to obtain the situatipn; and that brings me to a long story that I have to tell you. Come along with me now, down town: you can stop at the hotel and send up your trunk, and then I shall have something to show you as well as to tell you." As soon as they had got into the street, Luther began the story of his visit to the bank, and of the mysterious increase of his account. The Captain was all attention, and wonder. "Who do you suppose it could be?" "I don't know exactly yet, but I begin to have my sus- picions." "It was some woman," exclaimed the Captain, suddenly wheeling around in front of Luther and stopping him short in his walk,--"it was some woman.  Oh! Luther, you haven't been getting in with any of these poor wretched women-reck- less and generous,--have you? Wages of shame and sin, Luther!-you wouldn't touch a dollar of it. They say there are young men, young gentlemen they sometimes call them- selves, who do. Luther, I loved your mother. I love you as my own son, and I would sooner know you a bold open thief -it would be more manly." Luther hastened to relieve the worthy Captain's apprehen- sions by telling him of his suspicions of Madame Steignitz. After describing the old lady, her mode of life, and her per- sonal habits, and explaining his relations to her, and mention- ing the rumors of her wealth, the Captain more than shared the suspicions, and expressed the conviction that Mr. Whop- pers was right, and that the donor could be no other than the old Frenchwoman. IrRI! 16 c I -. -- .' 1 - '-.  .. .   NEVER A GAIN. I        315 "Well, you will be still more sure of it when I tell 3)ou something more," replied Luther, "but 'in any case the money is clean enough for me to use. Of course I shall always hold it as a loan, but I will tell you what I think of doing with it." Luther first unfolded his plans in relation to the brig. "My dear boy, I cannot think of it," replied the Captain, grasping Luther's hand. "Why not? I let you have it as a loan upon good security. It will be perfectly safe. The brig's insured. You are a judge of ships. We would buy only after you have made a thorough examination, and are pretty fully satisfied that the share is worth the money." "Well, in that case," replied the Captain, hesitatingly, "I don't know but that might do. But the fact is, Luther, you are so young." a Young! Why I'm of age, ain't I! You forget that I have been three years in active life in New York, and one ages terribly in that time. It is true I am not nominally head clerk, but I am really chief managing clerk under Mr. Gainsby. You' don't suppose that a fellow that the great firm of Ledgeral, Shippen and Co. send out to fill orders for fifty thousand dollars worth of goods for a foreign market, don't know what's right and what's wrong in a little matter of his own? But-after all, Captain, I don't know that we will buy a share into that old brig. I think that perhaps we can do better." And Luther went on to inform the Captain of the proposition of Madame Steignitz. "Mind you," hie said, "I am not sure that anything will come of it. It may have been all talk, but I shouldn't wonder if she meant it. At any rate, I am going to find out all about the ship. Now if you'll go and send up your kit to Bleecker St. and afterwards join me at the store in Burling Slip, in about two hours, I think I shall have an hour to spare, and we will go on board the Spoondrift and take a Ilook at her. Afterwards you can go over to Brooklyn, and make an examination of the old brig. What do you say?" "Say, my dear Luther, I can't say anything just at this moment," and the Captain wrung Luther's hand. "I am just   316        NEVE R AGAIN. taken flat aback. However, I'll pay off on one tack or the other in a little time; I'll take a walk by myself now, and join you in about two hours. You won't have to wait for me. But I am almost afraid to go on board the Spoondrift. I am afraid she will spoil me for the brig. However, I don't mean to let my hopes run away with me. I shall be but too thank- ful for the old craft, and will resign myself, as the old song says, to see the Spoondrift -' bear without a sigh Some one by fortune favored more than I.'" Oh, you need not think that I have been reading Mon. taigne, and Shakespeare, and Plutarch's Lives all my life for nothing; and there is as much philosophy to be fished up out of sea, if one has the right kind of a hook for it, as you can find on the land." In going down to Burling Slip, Luther stopped for a mo- ment at the office of the agents and part owners of the Spoon- drift, by whom he was recognized as a clerk of Ledgeral, Ship- pen and Co. In reply to his demand if they were still desir- ous of disposing of a quarter-interest in the ship, an affirmative answer was given. "And if that share is bought in the name of a competent and, experienced man-an able and energetic sailor, and a skilful navigator, will it insure him the command?" "Certainly-we are on the look-out for a commander at this moment. Captain Digsby, who came home in her three weeks ago, is desperately sick, and probably will never go to sea again, and the first mate, who is now in charge, is well enough in his way, but he knows a good deal more of seaman- ship than he does of navigationr She is too fine a ship to risk in anything but first-rate hands." "Well, will you give me the refusal of the share at nine thousand five hundred, until to-morrow morning? That is but a short time to make proper inquiries and examinations, but, as I already know something of her history, it may do." The agents held a short consultation, the result of which   NEVER AGAIN.         3I7 was that Luther should have the refusal at that price, and an appointment was made to meet Luther and the Captain at the ship, in the course of a couple of hours. At the time agreed upon, Luther found Captain Colbings waiting for him outside of the store in Burling Slip, and as he had a good many commissions to execute, they lost no time in setting off for the pier where lay the Spoondrift. They found the agent awaiting them, and together they had a half hour's ramble over the noble craft, at the end of which Luther, as he had no time to spare, bade the Captain good-bye, leaving him for a more deliberate and thorough examination. "Now, Captain," exclaimed Luther, as he descended the gang-plank, " don't get yourself so completely tangled up in the rigging of this ship, or buried so deep in her hold as to forget the lively craft you were admiring this morning. Rec- ollect our dinner is six o'clock, and Miss Jones likes punctu- ality." "Never fear, youngster. I shall be within lail, and when she gives the signal to close in, you'll see I'll spring my luff with the best of you." It wanted an hour yet of six when the Captain, having fin- ished his examination of the ship, and paid a visit to the brig at Brooklyn, returned to the house in Bleecker St. He had a good hour in which to overhaul matters, and put things a lit- tle more ship-shape. He comprehended, at a glance, that the furniture had not been arranged with the requisite atten- tion to economy of space, and he at once threw off his coat and began to shift his bureau, sofa, and chairs into their proper places. This done, he unlocked his trunk, which had been sent up from the hotel during his absence, and took out, carefully wrapped in paper, two or three sprigs of coral, and five or six shells, all of which he had gathered with his own hand on the shores of distant seas, and which, by a happy accident, had survived, in the custody of a friend, the catas- trophe which had sent his other goods and chattels to the bottom of the Hudson. These arranged upon the mantel-   piece and bureau so as best to display their beautiful tints and graceful forms, the Captain next made a dive into his trunk, and emerged with his library in his arms. No Mag- leab -chie or Casaubon, no crazy old bibliophile, no musty old Professor of Heidelberg, or Gvttingen ever had a more intense love for his books. He never moved without his library. Luckily it was not large. A classified catalogue would hardly occupy two lines. The Bible, Bowditch, Shakespeare, Plu- tarch, and Montaigne-that was all. The books were new and of cheap editions, and many a sad thought had they sug- gested of the old, worn, but better printed and better bound copies which were lying, if still in existence, fifty fathom deep at the foot of the Storm King. Still the Captain was not un- grateful. He often thanked God for small type, straw paper, and muslin covers, and the books had begun to show in va- rious places marks of the thumb-all except the Bowditch. There is no use for tables of logarithms on Lake Ontario. T2he Captain carefully arranged his books on his rickety centre-table, took a deliberate observation, from several points, of them and the shells, and concluded that there was nothing that he could do to improve their position or add to the gen- eral effect. "And now  I suppose," muttered the Captain, "I must dress for dinner. I don't like that much. Washing one's hands and face and brushing one's clothes-that is necessary and natural, but I always feel like a fool in a swallow-tail and -white cravat. But what does Montaigne say? ' The countries' custom to observe Is proper, and doth praise deserve.'"-  Fumbling in the recesses of his trunk he finally produced a white neck-tie, of a somewhat gorgeous style, with embroid- ered ends. It had been used at the charity ball for the Lake- faring-  en's Wives and Children's A id Society of which tile Captain had been persuaded to act as one of the managers, but it was still serviceable. With some m isgivings the Captain tied this in a most elaborate knot; but he had no hesitation   NVE ER AGA IN.   319   about the brilliant yellow waistcoat and the bright blue coat and brass buttons: those were a portion of costume that any lubber would admit to be necessary and perfectly comme ilfanz all the seas over. The Captain had just given the last finishing brush to his side locks and had seated himself; and, while awaiting the signal for dinner, was turning over a few pages of Plutarch's treatise on the virtuous behavior of women, when Luther en- tered the room. "All ready, Captain, eh? and en grande tenue. Why, what lave you put on a white cravat for? are you going to a party after dinner?" "I have put it on, youngster," deliberately replied the Cap- tain, "because Montaigne says, 'A wise man ought within to withdraw, and retire his soul from the crowd, but as to this outward garb and appearance, he ought absolutely to follow anid conform himself with the fashions of the time.'" "Well, that is all right in Montaigne, but I don't see how that compels you to don a white -cravat when no one at the table wears one but Parson Droney." "Do you mean to say that I can go to the table in my black scarf?" said the Captain, jumping up briskly and pro- ceeding to make the change. "Why I thought from the gen- eral style of Miss Jones' rig that a fellow would have to crack on everything that would draw to keep way with her. Bless me, what a relief this is! Do you know, Luther, that that white choker has already almost taken away my appetite ; I couldn't have made more than half a meal. I should have made as poor a fist of it as a chaplain at his prayers the first Sunday out. "Ah! there is the bell; we shan't have time now to talk about the ship; but after dinner we will come up to my room and smoke a cigar over it; and then I will take you round to Wooster Street, and we will see what Madame Steignitz has to say. You can tell me, however, in one word what conclusions you have come to. I suppose she is all they represent." "She is a perfect beauty," said the Captain, as they entered   320         NE VER AGAIz. the dining-room. "She is the handsomest thing I've seen this many a day," and the gallant Captain made his best quar-  ter-deck bow to his hostess,who had just taken her seat at the head of the table. Miss Jones heard the words, and blushed almost as red as the plate of pickled beets that supported on one side the mnag- nificent piece of roast beef behind which, for an instant, she hid her confusion. "The monster! the abominable monster! This is some monster of the isle, but if I can recover him, and keep him tame, and get him to church with me, he's a present for any she that ever trod on neats leather." We won't say that Miss Jones parodied Stephano in this absurd manner, but she might perhaps have done so had she known as much of the Tempest as the Captain knew. Room had been made for the Captain alongside of Luther, I which brought him opposite Mrs. Lasher and Dr. Droney. This was an opportunity which Mrs. Lasher seldom enjoyed, and which she could not, as one of the most important and influential advocates of women's rights, neglect--an oppor- tunity to ring in a new and unsophisticated male human, and lead him through the flowery mazes of feminine logic up to the philosophic heights of Saorosix. Mrs. Lasher was in her happiest and most fluent vein, and the Captain listened with an air of the profoundest defer- ence as her conversation, at first diverging in equally distrib- uted volleys among several auditors, became a fierce, concen- trated fire directly into him. Mrs. Lasher had just come from m^ting a speech at the Cooper Institute-a  most important speech, in which she had taken a  stride beyond-far beyond-her faint-hearted sisters who were lingering in the rear of the battle. "Do you know," she exclaimed, looking straight at the Captain, "that I no longer care to contend for women's rigits! so called, for their legal rights, their social rights, their polit- ical rights. I go a step further. I throw myself into the van of the movement. I  contend for their physical rights. The difference of sex! what is it but development? There was. p--------  I   N'EVER AGAIN.         321 no difference originally. It is a mistake to suppose the hu- man race was created male and female. The principle of nat- ural selection discovered by Darwin, aided by the principles of repellent differentiation discovered by myself, has, in the course of ages, disturbed the reproductive conditions, and di- vided humanity into the two equal segments which we cali male and female. Now these principles can be controlled a can be, not only modified and mitigated, but absolutely nulli- fied. The mischief can be undone. It will take time, it is true, but countless ages would be well spent in the effort, if the human race could, in the end, get back to its original uni- fied germinal condition." "You look incredulous, sir," said Mrs. Lasher. "Do 'I, Madam,?" replied the Captain, smiling' and bow- ing. "I beg your pardon. I did not mean it." "Well, sir,'I know that at thel present time this divarica- ting influence--this centrifugal force- " "Mrs. Lasher means," interposed Mr.. Whoppers, looking up for the first time from his plate, " by centrifugal force, a tendency to fly off the handle." The lady raised her eyebrows, and directed a look of scorn atthe speaker, that would have withered anybody but a New York editor. "This centrifugal force," she continued, c' is too strong-to be overcome in a day; but, in the meantime, I do not neglect the present. I contend that women should no longer be de- prived of their physical rights. They have the same rights in every respect as men. I make no distinction. I put all wo- men upon the same physical platform as all men." "Do you mean to say," demanded Mr. Whoppers, " that all women have the right to chew tobacco? In that case there would not be anything to choose between them. No, no, you can't mean it; that would be a little too strong. That would be flinging your principles, or rather your Cavendish and fine- cut, right into the teeth of public opinion." Mrs. Lasher waved her hand in contemptuous depreca- tion. 2I  322        NE VER A GAIN. "I mean to say that women have a right to all of the oc. cupations of men. That there are no duties that a man can perform, that women with proper practice and training cannot perform as well." "Would you make soldiers of them?" demanded Luther. "No, I wouldn't make soldiers of them," said Mrs. ,asher testily, "but I would make officers of them." "And let them lead on to death or victory on side- saddles?  A good idea that," exclaimed -Mr. Whoppers. "The men would be sure in that case to follow their leaders." "To be sure, and female officers would lead them as they have never been led before. Do you know-that I maintain that women have a peculiar genius for war. Do you forget Boadicea, and Joan of Arc, and the Maid of Saragossa, and many others? Do you forget the Amazons, whose armies were composed entirely of women?" "And don't forget the armies of Dahomey," interposed Mr. Whoppers. i"Tis said that they are very formidable, es- pecially for home service--they keep all des hommes in order." Mrs. Lasher glared' contemptuously for a moment at the speaker, and resumed her discourse. "I insist upon it, that an army of women would fight as well in the present day as in the days of the Amazons. Don't you agree with me, Cap- tain?" This was a direct appeal, and the Captain, who had been listening lost in wonder and admiration, bowed and smiled blandly. "Undoubtedly, Madam, if our women would make the same preparation for battle." "How so, sir?" "Why, Montaigne aYys,-not that he knewanything about it personally, but I havi no doubt he had good authority,- he says that they mutilated themselves ; that in order to han- dle their weapons properly, they cut off their right--right- what shall I  say?" and the Captain's rubicund face grew slightly redder, as he made a significant gesture. Miss Jones' eyes were cast down into her plate. She was   NEVER A GAIN.       523   pleased at anything tending to the discomfiture of Mrs. Lasher, but then it was a little doubtful how far the Captain might go. The ignorant monster might overstep the propri- eties of boarding-house life, and in pure innocence utter words forbidden. The other ladies within hearing seemed to share these apprehensions, and regarded the Captain askance from lids ready to drop before anything too indelicate. Even Dr. Droney drew himself up, puffed out his cheeks, uttered a pre- liminary " hem!" and prepared himself to protest against the introduction of anatomical subjects at the dinner-table. "Nonsense! Captain," at length exclaimed Mrs. Lasher, "I don't believe a word of it. It is absurd; but if it is true, it shows what women were capable of. Our women are capa- ble of the same, and more; or rather they would be capable of it, if they were fully emancipated and had their complete rights. Yes, sir: in case of foreign invasion, or in case of a grand intersexual contest, they would be capable of cutting off not only one, sir, but-but-both-both, sir." "That would he the safe thing to do," put in Mr. Whop- pers. "They could fight then without exposing their breasts to any danger." "Mr. Whoppers," exclaimed Dr. Droney, " you forget your- self. You are in the presence of ladies." "And of the Church, too, my dear Doctor. I beg par- don. I confess my fault. I would ask for absolution, if you were not always so hard on the high church." "You see, sir," continued Mrs. Lasher, "that I have demonstrated the capacity of women for all occupations and employments. I like to take the bull by the horns. There are many considerations, I admit, arising out of the grand fun- damental question of sex, which- have been kept too much by both sides in the back ground, but they have got to be dis- cussed fully before this thing is settled, and I for one am not afraid of them. I am willing to throw aside all false delicacy, and meet any masculine physiologist half way. But pending such discussion, and' in reply to the sneers and impertinent and illogical assumptions and questions of the male human, I  $24        , NEVE' AGAIN. claim for women all occupations, all employments, all places. Dolt you think I am right, sir?" The Captain hesitated, but smiled benignantly, and in reply to the lady's fierce stare of inquiry, gave a dubious shake of the head. "I have settled the question as to fighting. Mention a duty that a woman whose brain and body have been properly exercised and developed cannot perform-a place that she cannot fill. Mind you, I do not speak of woman demoralized, devitalized by slavery; etiolated soul and body by domestic drudgery; but as she might be-a true woman. I pause for your reply." "Madam," said the Captain with a slight twinkling of the eye, " what do you say to sitting astraddle of a yard-arm and hauling out the weather earing in a sou'-wester." The Captain intended nothing jocose, but a loud  laugh from several bearded brutes, headed by the Editor of the Uzi- verse, greeted the remark. Mrs. Lasher, quite disgusted, in- dignantly swallowed a few mouthfuls of pudding, while a pro- found silence of two minutes fell upon the whole table. After which the tide of talk resumed its flow ; at first by little jets, until Mrs. Lasher, giving a few preliminary conversational jerks, turned on a full head, and sailed in on a current of spiritualistic discussion. "She had that very morning. been attending a  most suc- cessful seance. The manifestations were truly wonderful. The most contemptible skeptic that ever lived would have believed and trembled. Such sights and sounds; such raps and taps; such a ringing of bells; such a jingling of guitars and piano-strings; such a waving of phantom hands; such a floating about of bodies generally, had never been seen be- fore." "And   pray, Madam," demanded Dr. Droney, "were the communications from the spirit world unusually important?" I  cannot say that they were," replied Mrs. Lasher, "or that they were quite as clear as usual. The spirits seemed to content themselves with exuberant manifestations of their   NEVE lR AGAIN.          325 presence, and did not seem to desire, as much as they gener- ally do, verbal communication. They were evidently in great glee, and seemed as if unable to compose themselves sufn- ciently to answer our questions. We had, however, one im- portant communication, and from a member of the highest sphere. Who do you suppose it was Dr. Droney? No less than the spirit of the great Hahneman. He said that he sei- dom had a greater pleasure than that which he had just en- joyed in reading some lines of a modern English poet." "Oh, Mrs. Lasher," exclaimed Dr. Droney in a tone of anxious interest, " did he repeat the lines?" "He did." "And do you, my dear Mrs. Lasher, remember them?" "I do; listen. ' Sound the loud medical eclectic timbrel, O'er the British Isles, and across the wide sea, Till the hosts of despotic, rascally regulars, And tyrannical allopaths are completely vanquished, And the people and the independent eclectic doctors Are forever set free-forever set free.' When, oh! when, Dr. Droney, shall we have such a poet- a true American poet? One who will attune his lyre to the music of the spheres,-one who will time his chant to the gigantic stride of the ages,-one who can pluck a plume from the pinions of the great American eagle, and inscribe amid rolling worlds, upon the blue vault of heaven, in letters of fire, the word FREEDOM?" Neither the Doctor nor myself," exclaimed Mr. Whop- pers, " can answer you when such a poet will appear; but 1 think I can venture to say that if he appears, and writes that word in the place you propose, no mortal on this earth will have a better right to say ' How is that for high?" There was a general laugh. Even the bland and, towards women, ever deferential Captain smiled a broader smile than usual.  Mrs. Lasher turned upon him somewhat fiercely. " Are you too amnong the scorners? Are you too a skeptic? Do   326        A 'VE R AER AIN.  you doubt all manifestations? Do you doubt that a table can move without human hands touching it?" "Oh no, Madam," replied the Captain. "I have not the slightest doubt of that. I have known it. I have seen it with my own eyes." "You have!" exclaimed Mrs. Lasher, a sudden smile rippling from brow to chin, and breaking the rigid lines of her face. "Listen, Dr. Droney. Listen all. The Captain will tell us his experience. You have seen a table move! under what circumstances pray? Who was the medium?"' "There wasn't any medium, Madam. We never do have any medium in those latitudes. It is always flap-flap, roll- roll, as lazy as a dead donkey in a duck pond, or else you have the very devil himself tearing away at your gaskets and ring-bolts. There is no medium about it." "But the table-turning?" "Oh yes, Madam.  I have seen a table turn completely over. I have seen it break its lashings and jump up and smash the lamp hanging over it." "What a violent spirit!" "What an evil spirit!" exclaimed  Dr. Droney. i"It proves my theory: evil spirits all--the devil and his imps,- nothing but the devil!-nothing but the devil!" "When was this, Captain?--when was it?" demanded Mrs. Lasher in a tone of intense interest. "Well, it was in a tornado just off the Isle of Bourbon. You see we lay on our beam  ends for more than five hours and when the wind lulled the sea got up, and I thought more than a dozen times that the old ship would turn bottom upwards. I tell you what, I felt like saying with- Gonzalo, 'Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, anything'-" "Pshaw ! exclaimed Mrs. Lasher, rising from the table. Nothing but a  tornado!"  "Nothing but a  tornado?" echoed the Captain. "I can tell you what, ma'am, if you had been there you would have cried anything but a tornado. Why, ma'am, do you know   what a tornado is? a big storm, now, I presume you think. permit me to explain the difference; if you had five or six big storms all blowing together one way, say nor'- west by north, and you brought along a tornado blowing the other way, say sou'-east by south, the tornado would blow all' your storms into a dead flat calm, blow clean over them, and blow a double-reefed-topsail breeze on the other side. Why, ma'am, a tornado has been known to twist a ship's masts right off short by the deck, and then scoop the hull up, and smash it down a hundred rod inland. I have known a hurricane, which is the same thing, -roll heavy cannon along a rampart like chips, and at Turk's Island, once, a tornado took a bundle of shingles, tore it open, and sent the shingles flying with such force, that one striking a negro on the neck, cut his head clean off, and the head went bowling along until it lodged, in the wreck of a salt-house three miles off." Mrs. Lasher had no great taste for physical phenomena. The aridity of mere facts-the dulness and littleness of or- dinary nature, disgusted her. Like mnost women, she felt a strong disinclination to cramp her mind down to the petty rules and regulations of scientific observation. As she said to herself, her world was the world of theory--there, up-borne upon the pinions of an enlightened faith, she could float from peak to peak of knowledge far above the bands of miserable scientists toiling amid the dust and mud of science and strug- gling for facts in the bonds of a self-imposed logic. What interest could an adept in the supernatural and the transcen- dental-a professor of socialistic and spiritualistic philosophy, take in storms and tornadoes, and such foolish subjects; so she at once rose from the table, and, followed by her disciple, Dr. Droney, stalked off to the drawing-room; while Miss Jones and a half-a-dozen others, including Luther and Mr. Whop- pers, drew round the Captain and encouraged him to go on with his stories of marine table-tipping. Tea came and went and still the Captain remained master of the field, while Mrs. Lasher fingered her teaspoon in jealous silence. Even Dr.   328        NEVER AGAEIN. Droney was more than once choked off fromsome profound utterance, by an energetic call upon the Captain for more talk. At length Luther was compelled to interfere and inform the Captain that it was time to make their contemplated visit to Madame Steignitz, if they were to see her that evening. In anticipation of this visit Madame had bought a third chair. It had seen service, but was still fit for duty, and cer. tainly more comfortable than the top of a rough deal box, which, in default of the chair, one of the three would have had to occupy. She received the Captain courteously but cautiously, and asked a variety of questions, finally coming down to the subject of the ship in a hesitating way, that beto- kened, as Luther thought, no very brilliant prospect of their being able to purchase the share. His heart began to sink within him. The Captain gave a glowing description of the vessel, praised her rig, her model, and her construction generally, and expressed his satisfaction with her sailing qualities, as repre- sented by her agents and first mate. Madame listened with interest, but suddenly glancing at Luther, her eyes drooped, and her face lengthened. "Oh, I am so sorry. I am so sorry. I am such a poor woman," she exclaimed. "If I were rich you should see, but I have so little money. Oh, it is so very hard for a poor woman to get along. I go round,-I try to borrow some money on this house. Everybody say, 'No, I do not like a second mort- gage.' But I cry, Mon Dieu, I must have the money! 'tis for to buy a ship for my dear boy here, and his brave friend, and they say, ' Go away, we have no money to lend.' I say, What can I do? And then I think, think. Oh, I rack my brain, as you say in English. But if I rack my brain till I go mad, that will not make money. Besides that, no one likes a sec- ond mortgage. 'Money is very tight now. Nobody has got money to lend.  You know that, eh? The newspapers all say the money-market is so tight. One per cent., two per cent. a month, eh? '   NEVER AGA IN.         329 " Well, Captain, that puts an end to the Spoondrift," and Luther could not keep his mortification from showing itself in his tone of voice. "Never mind, youngster, it is of no great consequence," and the Captain took Luther's hand in his own, and gave it a cordial squeeze. "It is perhaps better so, and you know I'm used to it. As Edgar says, I am ' A most poor man, made tame by fortune's blows.' I have built me castles in the air before now, and have seen them tumble without crying. As I walked her deck this morning, I thought to myself that the old brig would better correspond to my fortunes. Much obliged to you, ma'am, all the same. You have shown your good will, and, as one of my old friends says, 'hearty endeavor deserves a meed,the same in kind, if not so rich, as does a full performance.' Much and deeply obliged to you, ma'am. So I'll bid you good-night now, and leave you and Luther to your German lesson in quiet," "No! no!" cried Madame Steignitz, " sit you still. I have not finished all I have to say. Take your chair-take your chair--I insist." As the Captain resumed his seat, the old lady rose, and bustling across the room to the old buffet, pulled open a drawer, and took out a parcel wrapped in brown paper, which she placed on the table between her two guests. The Captain eyed the greasy-looking package with some' curiosity. "She can't be going to console us with a red herring," whispered Luther, as he sniffed up a strong odor of that in- teresting animal. "You see," said Madame, resuming her seat, ' I could get no money upon mortgage. Everybody refuse a second mortgage. But somebody, he say to me, I like this house. I will buy this house. I say, How much you give. He say, Twenty thousand dollars. But, I say, I cannot move from my room. He say, You need not; you shall keep your rooms for nothing, because you shall be my agent to rent the apart-   330        N EVER AGA I.            ments. I say, Very well; there is a mortgage of twelve thou. sand dollars that you can pay when it is due, and eight thou. sand you can pay me cash down, and two thousand afterward.", Luther and the Captain earnestly protested against any such sacrifice for them. The price was too low. She must not-should not give up a property that was so rapidly rising in value, and would be soon wanted for business purposes. It would, he really throwing it away. Madame Steignitz nodded her head in a knowing way three or four times, and screwed her face into a cunning leer. "Chut! Don't you be afraid. I cheat him two thou. sand dollars. I know how old and rotten it is. I know all the rat-holes. I know all the nuisance. Don't you be afraid. I make a good bargain. My- money will be better in a new ship than in such an old tumble-down thing as this." "But how long," demanded Luther, "will it be in forth- coming? It takes so long to search titles and draw deeds, and I am afraid they will not hold the share for us." "Ah! I think of that. I say to him I must have the cash right down. You can wait for the deed, but I must have the money now, to-day. There it is; count it, and put it in your pocket." Luther took up the package, and untied the dirty piece of coarse twine that encircled it. He unrolled five or six cover- ings of the stiffest yellow straw pqper, bearing the marks of the pound of salt pork round which it had at first come from the corner grocery, and took out eight new crisp bank-notes of a thousand dollars each. The old lady sat with her elbows on the table, and her chin in her hands, evidently enjoyingthe looks of mingled sat- isfaction and astonishment with which the two men alter- nately regarded her, each other, and the bank-bills. "All right, eh? That will do, eh? You put your monies to that, and Monsieur le Captain will have his ship to-morrow. I think, Luther, he must ask us to come down to his cabin, and give us a little something good, eh! Let me see, what shall it be,-.-pa defoiegras? No, no, that cost too much. We will   have just an omelette aux rognons, or a fricandeau aux eli- nards, and one small bottle of Champagne, and I will think that I am once more in the little cabinet sur l'entresol of the cafe Anglais. Ah mon Dieu! maon Dieu! Comme le temps passe. Arrangements for the purchase next day of the share in the old lady's name were settled upon; she seeming quite in- different to the details,--her only apparent anxiety being that the money should be securely pinned into\ Luther's vest pocket. The gentlemen took leave of her with a few but hearty acknowledgments. Upon eing into the street they walked along together for some moments in silence. "What do you think   Captain?" suddenly demanded Luther. "I don't know what to think." "Well, I'll tell you what I begin to think, and that is, that all that story about selling the house is just a complete bit of gammon, or in other words, a confounded lie." "Possibly; but it isn't for us to give it so hard a name. Call it a little bit of feminine romancing-that would be nearer the mark. One thing I think, and that is that a woman who points up eight thousand dollars for such a poor devil as myself, out of pure affection for his young friend, has a per- fect right to tell any stories about it she pleases." It was ten o'clock when they reached Bleecker Street. Luther was not sorry to get in the house, and feel the money all safe in his pocket. By the merest accident, Miss Jones happened to be in the hall when they entered, and insisted upon their stepping down into her private parlor in the front basement, where she had ready a hot fried oyster with some toasted ship-biscuit-the nearest approach to a marine dish that she could command. Both the gentlemen were in good spirits, and somewhat hungry; and as may be supposed, the general geniality was not impaired by a glass of hot whiskey punch, brewed by the fair hands of Miss Jones herself, and in which, with some sly complimentary remarks, the gallant   332         NE VYE A GAIVN. Captain pledged his fair hostess, and afterwards drank to Lu. ther, Madame Steignitz, the Spoondrift, himself, and the world in general. The Captain retired to dream beautiful dreams; to glide over halcyon seas in a splendid clipper ship under full sail, without the necessity of touching braces or clewlines; and to wander hand in hand with a buxom maiden in frizettes and flounces, through the flowery meads of a nice little box on the Hudson. Miss Jones retired, but not to sleep,--her active fancy converting the sounds that came from her neighbor in the next room-a hard sleeper-into the creaking of bulkheads, the moan of the waves, and the sighing of the wind through the tightened rigging. Luther was soon in a sound sleep, but was several times startled out of his slumber by a frantic effort to jump a golden gulf, and one time almost flung himself out of bed by a des- perate attempt to swim a silver sea, and lay a sprig of forget- me-not, which he carried in his mouth, at the feet of a female figure standing on the other side all decked in chignon and crinoline, and costumed in a resplendent robe of some mate- rial so delicate and fine, that while concealing the formn, it allowed the general luminosity of the angel within to flash through. v    CHAPTER   XVII. rhe Spoondrift has sailed--Spooner and Boggs on Aristocratic For- eigners--Mrs. Ledgeral in trouble-A Matrimonial Confab-An Anonymous Bouquet. TLESSED be the man that first invented the chapter. I don't mean an arbitrary and inartistic division at the end of every .fifteen or twenty pages, but the division that marks the natural, yet connective sections of an organic whole, like the joints of a bamboo, or the segments of a tape-worm. A necessary indication and out-growth of an inherent specific vitality. Sentences are, and probably always have been, a common and universal necessity of life. Paragraphs have their vir- tues and utilities, but the chapter is the crowning mercy of novel-wrights, and, we may add, of novel-readers. The chapter stands for so much time elapsed, so many in- cidents unrecorded, and, in fact, unmentioned; so much sup- posititious development of character and ploti that it must be considered one of th'e chiefest instruments of the novelist It saves so much of uninteresting description ; so much of tedi- ous detail; so much of interlinking twaddle, that the novel- reader is under equal obligations. It covers ground, as well as time, so nicely; and, when used adroitly, shifts scenes so deftly, that both can join in the invocation, blessed be the man who first invented the chapter. We. will take advantage, then, of this invention, and sup- pose the Spoondrift has taken her departure, and, under the skilful guidance of her happy captain, is already nearing her destined port. Luther still continues his visits to Madame   334         NE VE:R A GAlIN. . Steignitz; and that not alone for his German, in which he is making great, progress, but because he has really become very much interested in her. Despite some of her disagreeable personal habits, and the actual squalor of her apartment, he could not but admit the influence of her vivacity, her knowl. edgce of the world, her great conversational powers, and her most decided and manifest affection for hIlmlself. Even if he had disliked* her he would still have continued his visits. They seemed to give her pleasure. She milght not be poor, but she was evidently forlorn, and, in addition to pity, and a stronger feeling of affection than he was aware of, he felt that he owed her a deep debt of gratitude for his progress in the languages, and above all for her aid in carrying out his scheme for the advancement of the Cantain. Luther was of too generous a nature to speculate upon future benefits, but he could not conceal from himself the fact, that in the balance of obligations, the old lady might have it in her power to hold him always at a disadvantage, however much he might do, for her. Nothing unusual had occurred in Luther's life. Close at. tention to business, some study, and occasional theatre and opera-going on nights when he was not visiting Madame, made up the daily routine. His opportunities of meeting Miss Helen Ledgeral continued few and far between. Once since his first party he had been invited to Aunt Shippen's. He saw her regularly at church, and had contrived to meet her two or three times in the street, but there was always some one with her, and there was no chance for anything more than a bow and a passing remark. But looks and tones, like tele- graph wires, can be made to convey a great deal of informa- tion that the ordinary observer cannot even guess at; even if the message is intercepted, it is generally in cipher, and can be read only by persons that have the key by heart. In this way a great deal of sentimental progress can be made, with- out even the parties themselves being fully aware how far they have gone.  Like water percolating through a quicksand, the slender, confined, impeded stream of love makes its way   silently, without surface indications, until the whole being is saturated with passion, and ready to slump off into the ocean of matrimony at the first high tide. It won't do, perhaps, to say that Helen Ledgeral was deeply in love with Luther; but there can be no hesitation in stating the fact that he was most- desperately in love with her. It was, therefore, with a sentiment of deep mortification that he found that there was to be a party at the Ledgerals to which he was not invited. What could be the reason? Had she deserted him? Impossible! She had replied to his passing salutation the week before by the brightest, most cunning little smile, and the least touch of a blush, which said as plain as words could say, ' I am afraid that I am a little too glad to see you." Could she have lost her influence with her mother and Aunt Shippen, and dared no longer to suggest an invitation for him? Not probable. What could it be? Were the old folks getting jealous of him? Perhaps! But how about that young Count who was coming from Germany, consigned -to the care of Mr. Ledgeral,--was he good-look- ing? He was very rich, that was certain, and a real Count- none of your impostors who have so frequently exploited the ingrained flunkyism of the Anglo-Saxon character which obtains everywhere, but, perhaps, with more intensity than anywhere else, in New York society. Luther's mortification took a tincture of rage as he cogi- tated the case of a veritable Count, young, rich, and hand- some. He will certainly fall in love with her, and how can she resist him? and why should she resist him? Any verita- ble Count, old, rich, and ugly, could undoubtedly pick and choose among all the other girls in New York. Didn't every- body say so? Didn't all the newspapers say so? Don't Spooner, the head clerk, and the one who has been sent out several times on foreign business for the house, say that the funniest sight he has ever seen both at home and abroad, is a lot of American girls of high fashion running after some vagabond sprig of English nobility, or some fiddling, dancing,   336 -'       N  YEVER AGA IN. gambling, frog-eating, macaroni-sucking, fortune-hunting loafer with a Continental title-about equal in real value, as titles go, to a continental d-n. Spooner says that the fellow has only to pirouet, flap his wings, crow a little, and all the fash- ionable girls who have a drop of English blood in their bodies, however diluted, will rush round him, fluttering and cackling, and ready to swallow any stuff he can scratch up for them. It is true, Boggs says that Spooner is, to some- extent, mistaken. He says that the girls are really too busy with their own little flirtations with cousin Tom, and Tom's cousin, Jim, to bother themselves much about aristocratic foreigners. Their first social plumings and flutterings are enough for the young things, or, in other words, the mere sparkle and foam of the Champagne gets into their unpractised heads, and until that goes off they never care for downright draughts of a for- eign vintage. It is the old ones, Boggs says, especially the married women, and antiquated damsels of eight-and-twenty, who really do all the gobmouching of society.  You'll find that the cackling over a sprig of nobility all comes from them, and it don't indicate that they are such downright fools as you might at first think. It is the reflex action that they care about. Their attentions to foreigners of rank are merely social boomerangs. They launch them out, apparently, with a clear aim at the head of the unlucky foreigner, but really in the hope that they will twist themselves around, and coming back, knock down the thrower's own friends. Mr. Boggs may be right, thought Luther, but it is doubtful. Spooner is very emphatic. Now, if an old, rich, and ugly Count could take his pick from the general mass, why should Helen Ledgeral, who, to be sure, is not of the general mass, refuse one young, rich, and handsome? Of course she would take him. But then, what a donkey he, Luther, was making of him- self. The  Count hadn't arrived yet. Perhaps he  never would arrive. So, as Whoppers would say, what's the use counting on that Count. But then, why had he not received an invitation? Well, fi.                              NE VER AGAIN.          337 he'd have his revenge. He'd do something desperate. What should it be? Luther cogitated for some moments in 'silence. "I have it," said he. "Yes, I'll send her an anonymous bouquet, and I'll send her some verses with it. She'll know who it comer from. It isn't the first time. True, I made up my mind that I never would again. I would act fairly if they would act fairly by me. I know it's wrong, but I'll go hang but I will do it. I'll put in an allusion to her writing verses herself. If I can't be present in person I will be in spirit. I'll make her think more of me than if I were there," and with this diabolical in- tention Luther sat down to his desk. Now it was with these verses in her hands that Mrs. Ledgeral, the morning after the party, entered the library and carefully closed the door after her. "My dear," she said, "I have come to have a few words of private conversation with you. You do not expect any visitor, do you?" Mr. Ledgeral started. He had grown, of late, very taci- turn; very moody; in fact, morose, except at times when an occasional flash of forced jollity lighted up his manner. He sat alone in his study most of his time when at home, and re- pelled, as an intrusion, any visits of his wife and daughters. 'His looks began to betray some internal cause of anxiety. He grew thinner, lost color, and a wan expression was fast settling about eyes and mouth. But he would not tolerate the slighltest question about his health. His daughter Helen was the only one with whom he maintained anything like the old pleasant relations. Mr. Ledgeral evidently had his secrets. Mrs. Ledgeral watched him closely. At first she thought there was some woman in the case. What more natural? After fifty all men are such confounded fools and simpletons when a pretty face is concerned. Any woman with a little tact, and the slightest modicum of good looks, can twist them around her finger. But she was a sensible woman, and she wasn't going to trou- ble herself about anything of that kind. Besides she had always exacted a fair amount of liberty for herself, and she    338        NEVER AGAIN. recollected, not without a pleasant little blush, several flirta. tions-amiable and innocent, of course-which Mr. Ledgeral had kindly overlooked, and which, at the time, as she must admit, she had not been desirous of having investigated too closely. But, after all, there could hardly be a woman in the case. The symptoms were decidedly against it. He seldom went out of an evening; never went to his club; even the meetings of the Historical Society were neglected. His allowance of sherry at dinner had gained rapidly, and the Sunday Cham- -pagne was becoming a daily custom. The single night-cap of Bourbon had been frequently doubled, and more than once Joseph had grown almost white in the face at a requisition for gin and bitters before breakfast. It couldn't be a woman. It must be that confounded "business," and yet there were no rumors of disaster since they had got through so nicely the last great panic. She knew he had lost a great deal of money by outside speculation ; but then, if men will be so foolish as to lose money, it serves them right, so long as their wives and daughters have enough to pay Madame Volorem's bills, with all the charges for corresponding "fixings" generally; and of any want in that way there was no sign. Why, then, should she borrow trouble and bother herself about her husband's secret cause of anxiety? Middle age is short and fashion fleeting. No good-looking woman in society can afford to waste her time over anything but her own troubles. Her rouge-pot, together with the patent invisible wrinkle eradica- tor, and Phalon's degrizleizer, come soon enough without that. "I have looked in, my dear," said Mrs. Ledgeral, "to consult you about a matter that I think is beginning to require consideration. Not that it is at all serious, but in these cases one can't be too prompt. That clerk of yours-Luther-is a very good-looking young fellow." Mr. Ledgeral lighted up at once when he found that his wife was not about to probe any of his secret sores. "Yes, very good-looking; but I should hardly have sup-           '   [        A1: L 'NEVER A'GAIN.      33 posed his personal beauty sufficiently striking to have attracted your observation particularly." "Not mine particularly, others as well; and among them, if I am not mistaken, your daughter." "Laura?  Pooh! No danger, my dear. She has been too well trained to look for manly beauty anywhere but in a fellow's pocket." "You're too stupid, my dear. Laura is older than- he is, and besides she is just on the eve of getting a proposition from Jimmy Billinger.. Goodness knows I have tried hard enough for it. If the little wretch should back out now, and carry his million over to those Brooklyn people, I shall be ter- ribly disappointed. You need not look so disgusted. You know as well as I do that a girl like Lra can't marry at all unless she marries a fortune. The i ble hundred thou- sand that you say you will give her do sit permit her any free- dom of choice. She's got to marry, if she marries at all, a rich man. Society will have it so. She cannot slink out of Society; give up all her tastes and habits and associations, and live without sympathy or companionship, or else live with people whose manners and habits she detests, and who, after all, are just as mercenary and mean as people of the highest fashion. I know it's disgraceful and demoralizing, and all that, but what is the use of mincing matters between our- selves. I tell you what, I am so utterly tired of the daily lies and shams and pretensions that fall to my share in the busi- ness of life, that it is quite refreshing to speak the truth once in a while, if it is only to one's husband." "Well, my dear," quietly rejoined Mr. Ledgeral, "I don't suppose you have come here to convince me of the high esti- mate which the world and society, in all its grades, places upon money." "No, indeed; I have wandered away frog my real sub- ject. I came to tell you that if you don't look out for that clerk of yours, your youngest daughter may give you some trouble."  "What? Helen! You don't mean it?" t', i    340        NEVER AGAIN. And, as usual when anything agitated him, Mr. Ledgeral started from his seat and began to pace up and down the room. What if Helen should refuse to aid him in certain vague plans which had been floating through his brain? The. young Count Isenthal would soon arrive. It would be the duty of Mrs. Ledgeral to entertain him, to amuse him, to show him around, and no one could certainly do it better. He would, of course, be a great deal at the house, if he did not take up his actual residence with them. A travelling trip might be arranged for Niagara and the West. Helen would go along-the young man could not fail to be charmed with her. Mrs. Ledgeral would, of course, favor the scheme, and in the end, if events came to the worst in certain pending affairs, it might be much easier settling uncomfortable busi- ness matters with a son-in-law than with an outsider, who would have no special interest in the honor of the family. Everything, then, depended upon Helen. No dependence could be placed upon Laura. The Count never would fall in love with her; but with Helen there was some chance. She had just the manners to suit a foreigner, and more especially a nobleman-and the training and education. And then she had sense and feeling; and Mr. Ledgeral felt that he him- self could work upon her affections, and make her, despite herself, an instrument of his designs, and a means of salvation at least from open disgrace. He turned sharply to Mrs. Ledg- eral with the question: "What? Helen! You don't mean it?" i"I do mean it. I saw it the night he was first wanted to fill up a quadrille set. I know she had been reading some poetry of his in the Universe, that Mr. Whoppers had given her. Well, there was nothing in that; but I overheard her promise to let him see some verses about the steam-boat acci- dent which she had written, and which we all thought so clever for one so young. You recollect Professor Dozer, at Madame Clangin's, said it was the best poetical composition written in that school. Don't you recollect he paid her such a neat lit- tle compliment about changing her name from Helen to Sap- [P P   NEVER AGAIN.          341 pho, and Whoppers would have published them if I had con- sented. Well, says I to myself, here are two young people talking poetry, and both make verses, and instantly it struck me that the young man was the sender of that bunch of roses, with some lines, that Helen got a long time ago, before you took the young man into the counting-house. Don't you re- collect there was something about Moses and the peak of Pisgah, which you used to plague Helen about for a month afterwards? Be that as it may, I made sure there was danger the last night at Aunt Shippen's; so when his name was pro- posed for yesterday evening I just gave a positive refusal. I expected Helen to persist, or at least to sulk a little, but she did neither. She merely turned off as if it was not of the slightest consequence whether he was invited or not." "Well, I hope that relieved your mind," replied Mr. Ledg- eral.  "Just the reverse, my dear. I began at once to grow anx- ious, and I kept my. eye upon her. Well, last evening there came a magnificent bouquet and a note. Helen opened it, said there was no name, and slipped the note into her bosom. I did not say anything then, because the Benxes had come. Those people always do come so early. One would think they might stay up in the dressing-room a reasonable time; but no, down they went, and I had to rush down the back stairs to get into the parlor in time to receive them. I saw I len in the course of the evening slip out and go up to her ronm. I knew it was to read her letter; so this morning I went into her room before she was up. I saw at a glance that the note was not upon her dressing-table. If it had been I should have felt relieved, and perhaps said nothing about it. Said I 'Helen, I want to see those verses you got with the bouquet last night." She jumped out of bed with the key in her hand-I believe she had it under the pillow-and went and opened her writing-desk-the one, you know, Uncle Shippen gave her-and got them out; and as she did so I really believe her hand trembled, and that she blushed a little, but I can't be sure, as the blinds were not turned open, and   342        NE VER A4 CAIN. she always has such good color. Dear me, I wish Laura had as good a complexion, but she is getting as sallow as can be, and Americans are such geese, it won't do for her to be sus- pected of rouging. But there are the verses-poem, the fel- low calls theml-and if they are not by your clerk, Luther Lansdale, I don't know from whence they can come. Read them, and see if you don't think that, if theyv come from him, there is more than meets the eye. If he had not some kind of understanding with her he would not dare address her in that easy, bantering style. I wouldn't mind the usual senti- ment with sighs, and darts, and hearts, and all that stuff. It might mean nothing, and be perhaps all on one side. But there is, it seems to me, a spice of loving badinage here that makes me apprehend trouble. I don't like to have a clever, good-looking young fellow, who isn't worth a dollar, sending such kind of verses to such a queer girl as Helen." "That young fellow may have a brilliant future before him," said Mr. Ledgeral, slowly nodding his head; " he's one of the rising kind." 't I don't care; I want some one who has already risen for my daughter. I want some one who has his future in his pocket, even if he hasn't quite so much brains in his head. But read it, and see what you think of it." "A disguised hand, and too fine for my eyes," said Mr. Ledgeral, resuming his seat. "Read it for me; you have mastered the writing, and can do the poetry justice." "Oh, it- is not at all difficult. It is as plain as fine type," replied the lady, as she opened the paper and began to read: "' By Petrarchus. AD VITAM REDUX SED MORIBUNDUS.' ' What does that mean?" "It means," replied Mr. Ledgeral, "Petrarch led back to life, but dying." "Oh, ho! dying again for the love of Laura!" exclaimed Mrs. Ledgeral. "I wish it was Laura the fellow was dying   NEVE -eR A GA IN.          343 for. She'd soon send him to the right about; but Helen is so different; and I can't trust her with such stuff as this: TmIE ARGUMENT.-The poem opens, after a motto from t'ropertius, with an objurgatory allusion to bad news-the possibility of its being true questioned. The poet becomes classical and astronomical, and invokes the planetary gods in vain. Appeals to Venus, and asks her to send some heavenly express, some spiritual penny-postman. The inexorable Parcme. The poet becomes still more astronomical-the Goddess of Love defines her position, or rather the poet does it for her. She waves her Cestus-a curious meteoric phenomenon. Venus sends Chloris-the Goddess of Flowers./ Chloris enters, and, for the sake of the rhyme, throws her flowers on the floor instead of the table. She suggests a magnetized bouquet. Chloris becomes decidedly complimentary, but not more so than the subject war- rants. The poet charges Chloris with a message:-he makes a phys- iological supposition, and boasts, somewhat extensively, of what he would do if there was a passage from the nose to the heart. Chloris promises to deliver the message, suggests that it should be written, but whether on perfumed paper or not the poem don't say.

"There now!" exclaimed the lady, as she finished. "If that had come from Jimmy Winthrop, or Bobby Beekman, or Georgy Cutter, or Dickey Buggles, I wouldn't object to it, and I wouldn't mind it; but I know it isn't from either of them. Ham Boggs, or Pete Weddemall might have written it; but they are out of the question." "Is there no one else?" demanded Mr. Ledgeral. "Nq one, unless it might be Sammy Gillesland, or Franky Dusenbuy; but I don't think it is either of them. No, it's that Luther Lansdale, and no one else.' "I am glad to see," said Mr. Ledgeral in a testy tone, "that you can give one young man his full name." "Well, I admit," replied the lady, " that the fashion of calling gentlemen by the diminutives of their Christian names is absurd ; but I hear the girls do it so much nowadays that I quite forget how vulgar it is. However, about this Luther?" "iWel, what would you have me do about him?" demanded Mr. Ledgeral. "I don't know ; I suppose it wouldn't do to discharge him at once." "How would that help the matter? Gainsby says that he is getting to be perfectly invaluable. He could get a dozen situations in a week. Besides Uncle Shippen wouldn't like it. He has taken a great notion to the fellow. Do you know I rather think that Uncle Shippen would favor him if he wished to make suit to Helen. I heard the old man say to Mr. Whoppers the other day: ' Why, sir, I have examined him, there is no scrofula about him; -never had any consumption,   346        NE VER A GAIN. or cancer, or insanity in his family; all die of accidents, acute diseases, or old age. Why, sir, he had a great-grandfather that lived to one hundred and six, and then died of too much whiskey. I consider him a match for the best girl in town. I should- be proud of him for a son-in-law.' You know, my  dear, your brother is half mad about breeding out disease and improving the human race." "Oh, yes," replied Mrs. Ledgeral, with a sigh; " he is so queer. There is no doing anything with him. Well, I sup- pose we can't do any more just now. However, I will keep a keen look-out. After all we may trust to Helen's good sense. She is not a girl to be dictated to, and she don't care half as much about dress and show as her sisters, but still she is not a girl to make a fool of herself. I should despair of making her marry a rich man whom she did not like, but I should feel quite confident of persuading her out of any notion for a poor one." "You are taking the thing very seriously.' I don't see anything to be alarmed at. A young man sends her a bou- quet with some absurd verses-where is the harm in that?" Mr. Ledgeral spoke testily, almost angrily, for at heart he was more disturbed than my lady. The idea of Helen taking a fancy for any young man just at that time, before the arrival of Count Isenthal, interfered with the first faint shadow of a plan which he was almost unconsciously forming in his mind. "Well, my dear, perhaps you're right. If it were any other young man I should not mind ; but somehow I am afraid of that Luther. One thing, however," said Mrs. Ledgeral, "I am not going to allow any more invitations to be sent to Burling Slip. I never did approve of that kind of condescen- sion to employes. If you invite the whole set yo(u get an awkward squad. If you invite only those who are commne il faut in dress and manner, you puff them up and offend all the rest. There is no use in it. I don't care if it is a tradition in the firm or the family. Traditions must end. Nobody does it nowadays; not even the most primitive people. I don't suppose one of Tibbit's clerks ever entered the street   NEVER AGAIN.          347 door, and catch Mrs. Hickson inviting one of her husband's law students unless he was a good society young man. I won't have it any more. I don't care what Uncle Shippen and Helen say." A tap at the door, and Joseph appeared with a plateful of letters. Mrs. Ledgeral took her departure, and Mr. Ledgeral, running the letters over, selected one post-marked Hamburg, which he opened with a trembling hand. "Good heavens!" he exclaimed, starting up from -his chair. "So soon! the next steamer! I did not dream of that. Taken passage in the Hansa! Let's see-she has not arrived out yet-she'll be due here in about three weeks. But what is three weeks in such a strait? Two hundred and fifty thousand! It isn't much. It wouldn't have been anything two years ago; but that first half million played the devil. D-n the luck!'" Mr. Ledgeral ground his teeth and gesticulated violently. "If he is of an inquiring turn, and presses matters, I see nothing but a perfect smash; in fact, if he should get into the hands of some of those sharks I am not sure that he could not drive me up with criminal proceedings." The idea! He a great merchant; the head of the famous firm of Ledgeral, Shippen & Co.; director in a bank; presi- dent of the Society for the Suppression of Juvenile Delin- quency; vestryman of St. Cyprian's, and husband of the most fashionable woman in town, to be in danger of criminal pro- ceedings! Who in the world would imagine that a man of his social and commercial portliness could stand in such a tight place? Let us leave Mr. Ledgeral to his meditations. He won't suffer much after he gets down town. If he does Delmonico's is handy, and a little hot Scotch at the bar--though that is not very dignified, and must be swallowxed with rapidity, as a mat- ter of hurry and extreme business pressure-or a bottle of Champagne up stairs, always relieves one very much. Luckily, he has many exciting matters to occupy his mind and distract his attention by day-but at night-ah! that is   348          E VERA GAIN. the. time of trial, and he dreads it. Fear, the product of guilt, is a true night-plant. Like some of those gigantic fungi the botanists tell of, it springs up in the dark, and in an hour of restless tossing, sudorific, horripilating wretchedness, canopies our bed with a phantom toad-stool of gigantic size. The load that the conscience can jauntily stagger under in the broad light of day, amid the noise and bustle of the street, or the crush of the crowded mart, will, in the gloom and silence of the night, wear its bearer to his knees. In those wakeful watches the moral sense grows doubly keen, and, oh horror! the deed gilded into a venial glow by sun-light assumes its own true sombre hue of damning guilt. What can be more awful than the thought that, perhaps, the darkness that conies of death may likewise instantly clear the moral sense and ex- pose all the moral quality Cf our actions, freed from earthly glitter, and force long-buried memories in upon the quickened consciousness of the disillusioned soul? The sternest ortho- dox Christian, with a Calvinistic turn of mind, who deems that God's justice requires, in a single generation, the doom of eternal perdition for fourteen hundred millions of souls, save a couple of hundred thousand or so of the elect, need ask t r no better form or mode of punishment than that. * '                   \.   CHAPTER XVIII. The Count has come!-Social Commotion-American Freedoms-Helen and the Count-Helen and her Father-A terrible Secret. T was a great day in certain circles the day the Hansa arrived. Count Isenthal and two servants! What can he want with two servants? Why the Marquis of Hartcourt had only one when he was here. But there it was--Count Isenthal and' two servants! "Perhaps one is his cook," said Mrs. Struggles, "and he means to entertain us at dinner." "More likely," said Mr. Whoppers, -"the Count thinks that we don't know how to dish sauer-kraut and sausages, and has brought the fellow along for his own private table." Mr. Ledgeral had taken rooms for the Count at the New York Hotel as being more convenient. It wouldn't do to let the Count wander off up among the ravenous beasts of prey in the Fifth Avenue. Unless a sharp eye was kept upon him he ' would be carried off bodily, and completely monopolized. Now the Count must be held well in hand, and doled out in regulation doses. The very first day Madame D'Oberge had come down upon him with a card and an invitation to a mtsicale, and Mrs. Adam T. Timmings had sent an invitation to dinner, and had even gone so far as to consult Brown about the propriety and possibility of having in the hall of her little twenty-five-foot house half a dozen men in full armor, with flambeaux to light the Count up stairs, "mediaeval style, you know." "Now this kind of thing," as Mrs. Ledgeral emphatically said, "would never, never do."   350        NE VER A GAIN. Mrs. Struggles called at once at the Ledgerals. She saw the Count, and was introduced to him, and if there was any astonishment at the performance it was not felt by her. It more than rivalled in intensity of kotou the style of a great American diplomat in the presence of titled celebrities, while it infinitely excelled all his awkward and angular attempts at genteel flunkyism in the way of grace. Mr. Boggs happened to be present, and he told Mrs. Stichen that it beat anything he had ever seen ; " and I have seen," said he, "some pretty tall specimens of American ' fou- fou-ism in my time. I recollect seeing Mrs. Timmings at a small party at Rome. Somehow, by sheer pluck and push, she had got in, and was figuring in a cotillion with divers and sundry members of the old Roman noblesse. Well I never before saw any one dive deeper, stay longer under, come up in a bigger flutter, and duck again quicker; but Mrs. Struggles can jump off of the same plank and beat her two to one." Mrs. Struggles, however, after all, did the right thing. She took Mrs. Ledgeral aside and begged the use of the Count for one matinee. "And if you could, my dear Carry,"-Mrs. Struggles had advanced from Mrs. Ledgeral to dear Carry- "if you could, my dear Carry, let me have him, say about Thursday of next week, for a dinner and a small German after it, I should be so happy." "I don't know, my dear," replied Mrs. Ledgeral; "we shall have to consult the Count; it won't do to neglect his tastes and wishes entirely. But I'll see what I can do for you. I think I'll get you the dinner at least; but you must give Delmonico carte blanche; particularly in the wine. Boggs says that the last time he dined with you your Champagne had a smack of Yvorn, and your cutlets, d a provenrsale, were noth- ing but tough mutton-chops, with a little potato sauce over them. -And mind you, my dear, I won't have any of that Pushton set." Happily the Count knew nothing of the schemes and in- trigues of which he, or rather his title, was the object. He was disposed to be affable and generally agreeable. He had -          e --I...     NEVER AGAIN.         35 come out to see the country and to study the manners and customs of an energetic, practical, thriving, but utterly uncul- tured, unaesthetic, semi-barbarous people. Of course, in his own country, he had not the least idea of associating, except occasionally, upon terms of acknowledged superiority, with bankers, merchants, and professional men. But in Rome one must do as the Romans do; and, after all, what can you have better than the best. The Americans are, perhaps, not to blame for having no established aristocracy; besides it is possible that there are classes and sets in society at large where the division is too fine for ordinary observation. The Count was of a philosophic turn; he would inquire into that. There might perhaps be found, even in democratic America, something to appease the ingrained prejudice of German junk- erism. One thing, more than anything else, had tended to awaken this prejudice in the Count, and to lower American society in his eyes, and that was the facility with which certain of his countrymen assumed prominent social positions, who, at home, would stand about as much chance of figuring in the best society as they would of soaring to the moon. The Count was ignorant that the same thing takes place with Americans abroad. He did not know that hundreds of push- ing, unscrupulous, underbred representatives of the Great Re- public, with manners perhaps stereotyped by a few dips into the fashionable life of hotels and boarding-houses, but so thinly coated that the native brass and pewter shines through upon the slightest social friction-he did not know that hun- dreds of such people abroad enjoy a position which they could never achieve at home, and that many of them really do mount into the seventh heaven of republican enjoyment-into the company of the fashionably just,made perfect-into the crowd of blessed titled people who have nothing to do but sit all day long with coronets upon their heads, singing praises to the great ineffable BosH. But all this deep-seated contempt for American society was more than counterbalanced by-the profound respect, com-   352        NEVER AGAIN. mon to most Germans of the upper or educated classes, for the practicality of the American people. Why, they are a more practical people than the English, and the Germans have long sighed with secret envy of them. No sooner is a theory started, or a principle of science discovered, than the Ameri. cans seize it and try to turn it to practical account-get some. thing out of it-money, comfort, some kind of utility. Of course this is not a very lofty national characteristic; of course the Americans have no real culture; they have no solid learning; no accurate scholarship; no profound thinking; no oesthetical development; no depth in anything. It is all hurry-scurry, slap-dash ; cut down woods, run up cities, start churches, make laws, build steamboats, and telegraphs, and mowing-machines, and sewing-machines; all of which are really German inven- tions, and with every turn or twist grind out dollars. Now the German has in his heart the wish to do so likewise. He longs to show that he is not merely the learned dreamer that people take him for; that if he has the chance and the room -that is, if he can only extend himself a little; say, for in- stance, somewhat more firmly on the Adriatic and the North Sea, and a good deal more squarely upon the German Ocean- he can develop a practical spirit equal to that of any nation; can become as aggressive, as pushing, as realistic as an Amer- ican or an Englishman; and that ships, colonies, and com- tnerce would prevent the swallowing up of his surplus popu- lation by English-speaking people, and the consequent rapid spread of the English tongue, which, more than anything else, to many Germans, is an object of avowed envy. Physically, the young Count was a Teuton of the yellow- haired type, even to his long straggling whiskers and mous- tache. Blue eyes, and a complexion to match, and a lanky form with big hands and feet, made up his claims to manly beauty. There was, however, a certain style; a hodge-podge of ease and awkwardness, of simplicity and pretension, which, precluding anything like elegance, and far removed from the Yankee ideal of aristocratic manner, was nevertheless, in it- self, rather effective, especially as he was unquestionably a r- r rP -r  ----- - ----lc. . ..    NEVER AGAIN.          353 real Count, and rich at that, which was a merit that few other German Counts or Barons, genuine or bogus, visiting America, had ever possessed. He was well educated, talked well, spoke English nicely, touched the piano delicately, and managed about five notes of a tenor voice skilfully. He was, in fact, ein Mann von Geist. He was also, clearly, a young man who had a proper and prudent regard for the great business of making or saving money, and getting as big an interest upon what he had as could be dohe without too great a risk of the principal. In other words, he had in him the makings of a cautious specu- lator. It needed but a knowledge of this trait to make him a most interesting character in New York society; but not even Mr. Ledgeral knew that almost the first thing he did upon landing was to make some quiet inquiries as to the financial standing of the great merchant, and the estimation in which certain securities were held in the market. Nothing could be more satisfactory than the answers: "' Mr. Ledgeral was a safe man if there was one to be found in the world; not so rich, of course, as Astor, or Vanderbilt, or Stewart, but just as good, and the securities were fully as safe as United States bonds, and those, you know, are better than Consols, because they are sure to be paid." There was no necessity, therefore, for going into business matters at once. He could give him- self up to the festivities of the day; dance and sing and flirt with the girls, who, in general, can do all three with more spirit and style than either the slow and simple-minded maid- ens of Fatherland, or the speedy but rather ponderous belles of the British Isles. The mother-and-governess-ridden demoi- selles of France are, of course, nowhere in such a compari- son, and the only rival an American girl need fear is the fully emancipated married, Parisienne. The Count was charmed. The opera season happened to be brilliant, and a spirited rivalry in the theatres. The drives and rides in the Central Park he thought delightful; and then there was every day somewhere for dinner terappin, prairie hen, and canvas-back, with better Champagne, and more of it, 23 :,...*   . .   354        NEVER' AGA 4IN. than he had ever drunk before. And then the oysters! Well, the Count agreed in opinion with the late Earl of Carlisle that, for an ante-prandial whet, the Imperial, the Ostend, the Na- tive, do pretty well; but that for solid enjoyment, in a hun. dred forms-rising, at times, to the highest pitch of bivalvu. late ecstasy-you must go the Blue-Pointers, the Chingorora's, the East Rivers, to the tiny crustacean of Massachusetts, or the fat, pungent; golden-hued mollusk of Shrewsbury Inlet. But it was not alone in the question of oysters that the Count showed his good judgment and taste. The superiority of Helen Ledgeral in general cultivation and in manner to her sister, and to girls of her own set, struck him strangely and strongly, and, while eliciting his warmest admiration, exercised his philosophic insight, and gave him a very agreeable object of profound study. Unluckily, the Count was ignorant of some of the condi- tions of the problem. The influence of Aunt and Uncle Shippen was a quantity without which he couldn't well work out his equation, and which, on so short an acquaintance, he could hardly suspect. That she had better training than gen- erally falls to the lot of American girlhood was evident; but how could he know that she had been subjected to the close supervision of a sensible, practical woman of the world-a fashionable woman, it is true-but a born and bred fashiona- ble woman, whose one look on humanity was thus not neces- sarily limited to the narrow confines of her set. "Whence comes it " exclaimed the Count, "that this girl has by so nuch, of superiority to any of her sex that I have yet seen? Why do I look at her with an eye so deeply curious? Why do I begin to consider her with a mind so profoundly inquiring? Is it that I commence to see in her'-not her, but an eidolin of passion, and that it is my imagination that effulges the light that crowns her brow?1 No, no; I am cool, I am unimpassioned ; I am not in love ; I see her and not an eikon. What efficient cause, then, upheaves her above the plane of American common-place into the region of the universal ideal? I will question her."   NE VEAR A GAIN.       c355 The next morning the Count called at Washington square at an early hour-too early an hour, for the ladies were still in high conclave with a priestess of the modes. Helen, as being the only one disengaged at the moment, had to go down to entertain him until her sister and mother should be able to descend. "Hurry down as soon as possible, mamma. I can't un- dertake your high-born Herr more than ten or fifteen min- utes," and Helen closed the chamber door and rushed to the head of the stairs at a most undignified and unladylike pace. A passing stroke of the hand, and a dexterous circular sweep of the foot, sufficed for adjusting her plumage, as she flew down the staircase, her feet barely brushing the steps, and alighted with a little bound in the hall. Old Joseph put his head out of his den. "What's dat? Oh, Miss Helen, I tought you ben gone and sliding down de banisters agin." "Agin, you old goose, you! When did I ever slide down the banisters?" "Well, den, you mussen do it now, I tell you, cause you see what it is; you break someting sometime," and the old manthrew open the parlor door. "i!" he exclaimed to himself-with a grin, " can't she go up and down stairs jiss like a Streak of lightnum. Don't have to kind of drag up and sottle down, like some ob de young ones dat come here. But I don't want she should break someting; sprain her oncle, or dilumcate her instep, and have to scuffle round all de rest of her life. I must look out for dat." The Count had seen a good many things curious and strange in America, but perhaps nothing more strange than that freedom of manner which permits a young unmarried fe- male to receive and entertain alone a male visitor. A viola- tion of all the proprieties, a horrible and dangerous license he was at first disposed to consider it, but his views had been somewhat modified in a discussion of the subject with Mr. Boggs.   356        NE VER A GA IV. "You see, Count, 'propriety' is a mere relative term; what is proper in one place is not proper in another. Among some of the politest and best-mannered nations of the world, a man expresses respect by taking his shoes off and keeping his head covered-but let a fellow here come into a drawing. room barefoot, and with his hat on, eh! Now, whenever any one is doing something, however shocking it may be to others, which does not seem improper to the doer, it does not neces, sarily imply any demoralization. A French girl, in the case we have mentioned, would think that she was doing some. thing very wrong; and the gentleman would think so too, and fancy himself excusable in taking any advantage of the con- scious and intentional indelicacy." ' I see," said the Count. "The stranger has a right to criticise a custom in the abstract, but he must not jump too rapidly to conclusions as to mental and moral conditions which, in his own country, would be perfectly legitimate from similar premises." "Precisely," replied Mr. Boggs; " a good illustration may be seen in the difference ontcertain points between the two sexes. A gentleman, you know, may smoke, chew, drink, and swear--that is, within bounds-without absolutely losing his character of gentleman--without completely dropping all self- respect. But it is not so with women, even in this country; at least not as yet. If a lady, with us, should openly indulge in drinking, chewing, smoking, and swearing, she would lose caste; she would feel that she was doing wrong, doing some- thing not warranted by fashion. She would consequently lose all self-respect, perhaps lose all control of herself, and go from  bad to worse. But in time all this may change. Women's Rights are making such progress that the change may come very soon, and women be elevated to all the privi- leges of the male sex. And when that time arrives it would be a great mistake in a stranger to argue, because a lady regularly takes her eleven o'clock bitters, or blows a weed as she gapes out of the windows of Sorosis, or interlards her conversation with a few mllild oaths, that she is not a lady, or   NE VE:R  GAIN.        357 that there is anything really wrong about her. You see the point, don't you?" "I do," replied the Count. And thus corrected and in- structed by the philosophic Boggs, it was with nothing but a sentiment of pure pleasure that he saw Helen enter the room alone. The usual society chit-chat at first, and soon the conversa- tion wandered away from the region of personalities into the wider fields of literature and art. The Qount got so much interested that, for the moment, he forgot to push his perqui- sitions in the direction he intended. Suddenly he bethought himself of the inquiries he wanted to make. "Why, Miss Helen!" he exclaimed, " do you know we have been talking ten minutes without one bit of gossip- without any of that miserable, personal twaddle which makes up so much of the conversation of society." "Oh, you must not -abuse society for indulging so much in personal gossip. It has its uses and its utilities. It fills an office that no other kind of conversation could." "Do you think so?" "Oh, yes; Mr. Boggs explained it all to me one day. He says that it is absurd to denounce it as an evidence of the stu- pidity of society. Very clever-people indulge in it from a natural curiosity about persons rather than things, which is the founda- tion and essence of all-history. But beyond this, Mr. Boggs says that personal gossip is of the greatest utility as a kind of shib- boleth. Society is nothing without exclusiveness. Now,-if you are exclusive you must exclude somebody, and we have no artificial lines drawn for us as you have in Europe. There is needed some test, and society instinctively turns to and en- courages personal gossip, the knowledge of'who's who,' as a kind of safeguard against invasion." ( Wel, your friend, Mr. Boggs, is a very clever man," said the Count; a I perceive that he can find a reason and an ex- cuse for almost anything. But I should like to ask you one question. Why is it that Miss Helen Ledgeral indulges in it so little?"   358         NEVER AGAIN. It was the look and tone, rather than the words, that made Helen color up at the Count's question. "Why is it," continued the Count, " that Miss Helen Ledgeral always excites a disposition to talk and think of other subjects than the little miserable-pardon the epithets, but I will repeat them-the little miserable personal twaddle which, I must say, makes up more of the staple of conversa. tion here than in any set or circle it has hitherto been my for- tune to fall into?" "Oh! thank you, Count, for the implied compliment. I only wish I deserved it; but-" and with feminine art Helen dodges out of the dangerous corner-" we were talking of Goethe; you know his minor poems? Do you recollect the cathedral window, and how truly he presents it as an emblem of poesy. I remember a verse or two in the translation. You can see how they sound in English," and Helen repeated the lines:- "Look on it from the outer square, And it is only dark and dreary; Yon blockhead always views it there, And swears its aspect makes him weary. "But enter once the holy portal- What splendor bursts upon the eye! There symbols, deeds, and forms immortal, Are blazing forth in majesty. ' "Oh, I understand, Miss Helen!" exclaimed the Count. "You mean to say that you have accustomed yourself to look at the windows from the inside. I understand." Helen's laughing protest was cut short by the entrance of her mother and sister. "Where are you going, my dear?" demanded Mrs. Ledgeral, as Helen, wishing to disclaim any share in the Count's visit, was gliding through the open door into the back parlor. Thus addressed, she was compelled to take a more formal leave; she replied "that she was going at once to Aunt Ship-    NE VER AGA IN.         359 pen's-that she had promised her aunt to be with her early in the day." And making her parting salutations to the Count, who rose to open the door, she stepped into the hall, just in time to en- counter her father, who was coming out from his study. "Helen," said Mr. Ledgeral as he stood in a hesitating attitude with his hand upon the door. " Helen, I want to see you for a minute, and it may as well be now as any other time. You are disengaged?" Struck with a certain hollow cadence in his voice, Helen started and looked around, and for the first time noticed the very great change that had taken place in his face and figure. She had known for several -weeks that he had not been looking quite as well as usual, but as he had made no complaints, and had repelled all sympathizing inquiry or remark, and had even at the dinner-table testily rejected, or rather resented a sug- gestion of IMrs. Ledgeral's, that he should send for Dr. Pet- kaff, she had supposed that it was some passing ailment; or nothing more than the wear and tear of an exciting business season. Now the change came upon her at one glance with startling suddenness. She saw her father standing in the doorway, and almost leaning against the side, as if for support. His clothes, usually fitting so nicely, and carried so jauntily, seemed to hang upon him, if not in decided folds, at least in slight down- ward curves, that hinted of a shrunken form within. His cheeks had not fallen away so much, but their healthy hue had disappeared. In place of solid flesh there was a growing puffiness; and in place of the clear red and white complexion, there was the thick muddy tint that comes when care and fear govern all the movements of the heart, and send out with its every pulsation an unhealthy current of half-oxygenated, bile- laden blood. "What is it, father?" exclaimed Helen, as she rushed across the hall, and seized her father's hand. "Why, how cold your hand is, and it trembles too. You are not well! What is the matter?"   360        NE VER AGA IN. "Hush, my daughter! You will disturb them in the pat. lor. I am well enough. You need not fear for me, but I ad. mit 1 have some troubles, some cares," and Mr. Ledgeral led his daughter into the study and closed the door. "Troubles!" exclaimled Helen, "gnd I can't help you! I can do nothing for you-you-" "I don't know, my dear," replied Mr, Ledgeral as he drew Helen down to the sofa at his side. "I don't know; perhaps the time may come; but not now; some other time: sooner than we thinklperhaps. But now I want to say a word about yourself. Whbt is this that I hear from your mother about a bouquet and verses?" Helen laughed, quite innocently, but she could not prevent the tell-tale blood from momentarily deepening the delicate tinge of her complexion. "You mean the last that I have received--the one that came last night?" "Why, have you received more than one?" "Bouquets? oh yes, mamma could have told you that I have received a great many. Mamma takes a great interest in my bouquets. .She is quite proud of the quantity. Why, they come pouring in sometimes by the dozen." "And verses with them?" "Oh, not always." "Well, we will stick to the one with the verses that came last evening. I suppose you know where it came from?" "' How could I, papa? It was anonymous." "Well, if you don't know I will tell you. It was from Luther Lansdale.  Don't you think I am right?" Helen laughed quite heartily. "Why, papa, I did not dream that you were so good at guessing." "You admit it then?" "I suppose so. You see mamma would not invite him, so, to revenge himself, he sends me these absurd verses. They are rather clever, don't you think? I recollect you said a long time ago that something he had written for the Universe evinced decided literary ability." - .   NEVE. VR A GAIN.       361 "That may be, my dear; but that is nothing to the point. I am willing to admit that he is cleveA, well-mannered and good-looking, and he is certainly capable and attentive as a clerk, but all that won't excuse impertinence." "Impertinence? Father!" "Well, perhaps not impertinence, for I suppose the young man has some warrant for writing to you in the verses you have given him in return, for I take it for granted you have together discussed some of your own scribblings. Oh, you need not turn away your head; I am not going to ask you if it is so or not. I will take back the word impertinence, and substitute the word presumption. Yes, presumption, down- right idiotic presumption." "Oh, papa, that word is fully as bad as the other. I don't see how it applies any better; Mr. Lansdale sends me a bou- quet; but that is nothing; all the young men send all the girls bouquets nowadays; it is the fashion. Now why should it be presumption in Luther, Mr. Lansdale, I mean, to send me one? you know he thinks he is under great obligations to me for getting him his present position, and you don't think it presumption to express his gratitude, do you?" "Gratitude!" and Mr. Ledgeral roused himself for a mo- ment, and shook off his subdued and languid manner. Pass- ing his hand caressingly over the wealth of curls that made a chignon superfluous, he gave his daughter a penetrating look in which sparkled an arch vivacity to which Helen had for- merly been no stranger, but which she had not seen in his eyes for months. "Gratitude! what a precious little goose it is, thinking that she can humbug her old father so easily! gratitude! no, I don't object to the young man's expressing his gratitude, but I very much object to his making love." "Oh, father! How can you suppose, how can you think-" "Gently, my dear; don't get excited, and I will tell you, not only what I think, but what I know. The ordinary little attentions and gallantries of society may mean nothing, in ' .                 . ^-   * -   362        NEVER A GAIN. fact they generally do mean nothing; a young lady may re. ceive any quantity of flowers from a young gentleman of her set without seeing in them anything more than a very pretty E compliment which, perhaps, she but shares with others,--  without having any right to draw conclusions more weighty  than that the young man, having more money than brains, has ambition to be thought auxpetits soizs in some fashionable : quarter, and makes the flowers express a compliment he I would find it difficult to turn in words; or that he finds him.  self in unexpected credit with some incautious florist, and must jump at any excuse to improve the opportunity of run. ning in debt; or that his uncle in the country, who cares : nothing for flowers, keeps up a conservatory, and he thinks it 1 a pity to waste the chance of utilizing the clippings. But in this matter of Luther Lansdale the thing is very different ; the affair is much more serious. I will not stop now to say why, and in what manner it is more serious. You understand what I would say as well as if I had spoken it. In him it means downright love-making ; and in him it means also, considering all the circumstances, downright presumption if not something- worse--I won't say a want of common honesty, but I will say : a want of correct feeling." "Oh, papa!" exclaimed Helen, "you are too hard upon the poor young man!  I am sure he has a great deal of ex- cellent feeling."                   1 "I did not say excellent feeling," dryly replied Mr. Ledg- eral. "I've no doubt that he has plenty of it, and hb he has a i pretty good excuse for it too," and Mr. Ledgeral again laid t] his hand upon Helen's curls, " but he knows that nothing can come  of it; that he is not in a condition to make love in earnest, and with a purpose; that he can advance no proper 1 pretensions to your favor; that he has nothing to offer a girl ; brought up in fashionable life, and in habits of luxury and ele-  gance, but his good looks, good manners, and'a salary of fif- teen hundred a year." Helen tapped her little foot upon the carpet, and screwed up her month into an expression mutine.        I   NEVER AGA I.4         363 " Is he always going to be so poor ? " she demanded. '" I thought.that in this country some of our richest men com- menced by being poor, and that a youth of industry and energy, and knowledge, and talent, and ambition, was the best foundation of a fortune." "I have no doubt of his ultimate success," replied Mr. Ledgeral, " although thousands full as clever as he fail. In ten or fifteen years, perhaps, he may be able to offer a girl a respectable if not a very elegant home. Can you afford to wait for him so long ? " " I don't know, papa. I shan't decide that question until he asks me, and I don't think that he has the least disposi- tion.to do so at present." "That is, my dear; just what I find fault with. He has no intention of asking such a foolish question, and yet the simpleton is, by his sillygallantries and attention, encourag- ing his own absurd 'feelings and trying to engage yours. You had better put an end to it, my dear, and not leave the task to your mother or myself." Mr. Ledgeral marked the flush that mantled his daughter's face, and he hastened to correct his mistake. A threat is the last weapon of American parental authority, and must be used with. great caution. American girls have so much of their own way, and do so much of their own bringing up, that in matters of the heart a parental threat, in nine cases out of ten, only arouses opposition. Plead with them, argue with them in a gentle way; coax them, wheedle them, laugh at them, make fun of their idol, pick them up in time and break up associations by flitting to the Rhine, or, if necessary, to the Danube and the Nile; and, if possible, start Jim in opposi- tion to Tom, but don't drive your loving daughter into the arms of the adoring and adorable Tommy by getting angry and threatening to " break things." " Mind, I don't insist upon your duty to us, my dear," re- sumed Mr. Ledgeral ia "that I leave to your own judgment and heart; but I think that you owe it to the young man to put an end to his attentions. He no doubt thinks that you  364        NE AVER AGA IN. are, or will be, rich; oh, you need not think that I mean he is after your money; but-well-well-" Mr. Ledgeral started up in an agitated, almost frightened manner, and made two or three turns up and down the room. There was something in the excited tone of his voice, and in the sudden dropping over his whole visage of such an expres- sion of intense misery, that Helen sat riveted to her seat in wonder and alarm. "I'll tell you something," he suddenly cried, flinging him- self on to the sofa by her side. "A secret-a profound se- cret as yet, though God knows how soon the whole world will know it-but I must tell it to some one; I will tell it to you- to my daughter-to my little Helen." Mr. Ledgeral threw his arms round his daughter, and clasped her in a passionate embrace. He pressed her head convulsively against his heart, kissed her on the forehead, and laid his cheek against the soft masses of her lustrous hair. Helen felt the deep sob that shook his frame-felt the hot scalding tear that fell upon her upturned face. Her own emotion-a compound of love, curiosity, astonishment, and fear-was, for an instant, too violent for speech. She clutched his hand in hers, and as her voice came to her she whispered with scanty breath, "What is it, father? Tell me-say what is the matter! What can I do?" "Yes, yes," muttered Mr. Ledgeral; "I will tell my little daughter! why should I not? whom else should I tell? She has more sense than any of them, and she loves her father more than any one else does; don't. she, my darling-my dearest darling? Yes, yes, I will tell you, Helen," he re- sumed, in a firmer tone. "It will relieve my mind; it will lighten my burden. I know it is selfish to load your young heart prematurely, if only by a day or an hour, with trouble; but I am a weak, wicked man in more things than this, and it is, after all, necessary that you should know." A sudden wave of terror swept through the young girl's veins; a sharp, swift thrill of anguish vibrated through every nerve; a something gigantic, horrible, ghastly, seemed all at   NEVER AGAIN.         365 once to leap out from the shadow of the future and en- velop her in an atmosphere of black despair. Her father was about to announce his apprehension of the most terrible malady that affects humanity-a mind diseased, and-Oh hor- ror! he is perhaps already insane! She suddenly threw her arm around her father's neck. "No, no, father! it cannot be; it must not be! You are deceived; I know you are." "No, Helen, I am not deceived. I am-there can be no doubt of it-a ruined man." "Some temporary ailment - some curable disease! I know it must be. We will have the best advice; we'll seek it here-in Europe-everywhere!" "No, no, Helen, I do not mean my health. Would to God it were merely my health. I am ruined in fortune! You need not look so blankly incredulous-it is true-utterly ruined in fortune! No one knows it as yet; nobody must know it so long as it can be kept a secret. Your mother must not know it; your sister must not know it; and, above all, your uncle Shippen must not know it. My only hope is in keeping it secret. But I tell you-you only.-I am ruined! If you were to be married to-morrow it would be expected that I should treat you as I have promised to treat your sister, and give you a house and a hundred thousand dollars. My poor little darling, I could do nothing of the kind. I might give you a trousseau and a splendid wedding, but not a cent be- sides; and even that would be robbery." Helen felt something of a sense of relief at the announce- ment. Her first fear, so strong, so overwhelming, having in , degree blunted her sensibility to any less horrifying emotion. "I cannot understand it!" she exclaimed. "So sudden, so strange! But, father, why should you worry about it? We can live without fortune. Everybody is not rich; and I am sure everybody says that wealth is not happiness. We can live; we can love each other just as well." ".Ah, Helen, you know nothing of what the crash will be when it comes. Wealth is not always happiness, but it is, in   366        NEVER A GAIN.  this age, and in the society to which we belong, the sine qua i nzo of happiness; the something without which happiness or, in lieu of happiness, comfort, amusement, and mental and physical enjoyment are difficult of attainment. But it is non. sense for me to sit here and entertain my little girl with the  common-place twaddle, pro and con, of the moralists, about wealth. No doubt in practice we could be as philosophic as other people. No doubt we should be able to adapt ourselves to altered circumstances. No doubt that we should have some resources of enjoyment, even in poverty, if that poverty were not disgraceful." "And would our poverty be disgraceful? Why to us more than others?" demanded Helen. Mr. Ledgeral passed his arm round his daughter, and drew her down to him. "I cannot explain it all to you, my darling. You would not understand it, if I did; but I fear, in fact I know, that if I fail now, I shall not only be a ruined, but a dishonored man." "Dishonored! oh father! Is there no possible wav to avoid it. Cannot Uncle Shippen-" "Hush, my dear, not a word of him. He will suffer im- mensely, and I am  afraid will prove, at least in words, my hardest friend. The only thing that will save me-can save my honor, and the honor of us all--can save you, your mother and your sister, is time. A year, or at most two years, would put all things right, and nobody but you and I be any the wiser." Mr. Ledgeral paused, and looked at his daughter with a most woe-begone and pitying expression, but the pity that was in his heart was entirely for himself. He was too much taken up with his own misfortunes, and the consequent im- pending calamities, to think of anything else or' to properly estimate any sacrifice that would save him. He loved his daughter with something more than mere blind paternal affec- tion.  He had learned to admire her, and to respect her. She occupied. a place in his heart to which neither his wife   NE' VER AGAIN.         367 nor his eldest daughter had attained, and yet no thought of her feelings moved him, when hesitating as to how best to extort from her a consent to his plans. Still, let Ls do him justice and modify our ideas of his selfishness by a proper considera- tion of all the circumstances. Had he .been put to it, he would have argued that it was not alone to save himself, to save his honor, to save the credit of the great American Mer- chant, but to save his family, to save this very daughter from the evils and miseries and degradation that would attend his failure, and he would have argued still more strenuously, that his plan involved on her part no sacrifice at all. That to urge upon his daughter a husband with rank, fortune, and fashion, is nothing more than the duty of any father, and that he ought, apart from any advantage to himself, to exert his parental influence to that end. But Mr. Ledgeral had his doubts as to the best way of presenting the subject. He felt that Helen had a certain ele- vation of character that might lead her to spurn considera- tions which have such an overwhelming influence on the ordi- nary female mind. He felt that while her good sense, and sound judgment, and family training, and the influence of the social atmosphere which she had breathed all her life, would prevent her making a fool of herself, and yielding all pros- pects of comfort and enjoyment for life to the promptings of passion, or the suggestions of a silly and absurd sentimental- ity; on the other hand she might be equally indisposed to buy the comforts and pleasures of wealth and position by any sac- rifice of feeling or affection. She might prove quite'deaf to any arguments of mere self-interest, quite blind to any pic- tures of mere worldly splendor and pleasure. No; the better way would be to trust to her affection for himself, allow the terrible necessities of the case, and make an appeal to her heart. It needed no acting on his part for his white countenance to assume a most beseeching expression. "Can nothing be done?" murmured Helen. "It all depends upon you," replied Mr. Ledgeral.   368        N VER AGAiVN.  "Upon me?" "Yes! there is no other help that can avail me. You alone can secure the necessary time. Listen to me. This' young Count-you see what he is: tolerably good-looking,' cultivated, refined in his manners-that is for a German-and;' rich. Well, there is not a girl in town that would not jump at, him for a husband. Now, I can see that he has conceived a; desperate admiration of--whom do you suppose? Of you!' You doubt it? You need not. Your mother thinks so too. In fact he has as good as told us so." Helen jumped up from the sofa, and stood before her: father with her hands firmly clasped. "Oh, father, it is impossible! I can't have it! I won't : have it! I don't dislike him, but I don't love him!, I never, can love him. He may be all that you say he is, but I have made up my mind. I won't marry a European. They don't make good husbands,-everybody says so. They have at the: bottom of their hearts a contempt for women. I am not go-  ing to be the slave or servant of any man. I don't want a 7 husband who looks upon me as an appendage instead of a j partner, who thinks it ought to be enough happiness that I : have the felicity of waiting upon him and attending to his whims, and keeping his house, or showing off his generosity and good taste at parties and balls. I don't want a husband at all, but if I have one, I want an American husband; 1 want a husband to love me and respect me and wait upon mei and take care of me; I want a husband who will make me I love him with a perfect love,-with a love that casteth out all  fear, all sense of obligation; all feeling of inequality on the  one hand, and all feeling of self-all sense of contrariety of  interest, on the other. But I don't want any husband-! I1 won't marry any one. You must stop this thing, don't let it- go any further. I can't have it,-I won't have it 1 " Helen stopped short in her energetic tirade. Her bosom i heaved, and her breath came short, and she clutched her? hands tightly to keep them from rudely gesticulating in her passionate excitement.     P %i- r,, - :"7* -' t*   5    I I t                    I     NE VER AGAIN.       369 Mr. Ledgeral took her hand in his and drew her down again to his side. "Hush, hush, my daughter! you will, alarm them across in the parlor." "And besides!" suddenly exclaimed Helen, "what has the Coun. to do with the subject we were talking about, and how can I secure you the necessary time? The Count can have no influence with your creditors?" "Yes, all powerful influence." "He is not one of them?" "Yes, the principal." "And he makes my hand the price of his forbearance?" "No, no, Helen; you do the Count great injustice. He makes no such bargain as that. In fact I may be mistaken in supposing that he will be disposed to' make any bargain at all. It is quite possible that his admiration may not go to the extent of proposing for your hand. You must recollect that he has a great many prejudices to overcome, as well as your- self. There is your want of rank. True, your birth and breed- ing are the best in this country, and he would not esteem it a ter- rible mesalliance, as he would a marriage with the daughter of a banker or merchant of Frankfort or Hamburg. But, you are a republican and he a member of the most stupidly prejudiced -the most absurdly narrow-minded aristocracy in Europe. So it may be, then,} that there is not any very strong founda- tion for either my hopes or your fears. Let us wait awhile be- fore we make any resolves that we may repent of. What I want of my little daughter now is, that she should turn the thing over in her mind, and try her best to save her father, and her mother, and herself too, from a very great calamity. Try and see if you can't cultivate a little higher estimate of the young man's numerous good qualities. I would not urge you to anything that I thought disadvantageous or disagreea- ble, but I think that you have taken a wrong view of the mat- ter; that in your mind you have not given the Count fair play. I think that he is the most eligible match in town, and I will say that I have never seen any one to whom I would 24   370      o  ^E VENI R A GA!"N. more willingly intrust your happiness. Nay, nay, I know what you would say. I don't want you to make love to him, but don't be rude to him; don't refuse to listen to him. You can't fully realize what consequences may follow any action of yours. I can't explain the matter fully, but you can take my word for it, the most terrible fate hangs over your father by a single thread. Mere failure, ruin, poverty, 'could be borne. But come closer to me, my darling, that I may whis- per it to you. Mercantile dishonor and social disgrace may mean much or little; but what do you say to a felon's cell; to a public court with judge and jury, and your father at the bar?" Mr. Ledgeral's looks and tones were even more impressive than his-words, and aroused in Helen a feeling of dread that seemed to benumb all her faculties, and almost stifle the action ' of her heart.                   \ "Oh, father," she murmured, " can it be that in this coun- try an innocent man can suffer so? I thought such things were only in novels. You surely can never have done any- thing to offend the law. The law must be cruel, unjust, wrong--" "Many laws, my dear, are so, and it is difficult for a man in business to always steer clear of their clutches. But this is a thing you can't understand. Nevertheless you must believe me-my fate depends upon you. Decide against me," con- tinued Mr. Ledgeral, a sudden inspiration of. frightened self- ishness coming to his aid--" decide against me and you de- cide my death. I will never live to see the wreck of all things. I will not live to see my little daughter a beggar, almost an outcast." Mr. Ledgeral gazed into the great gray eyes, motionless, alnost rigid, and blank with the blankness of a wild, horrify- ing fear. His own looks fell, and his whole form shrank, and cowered, and shivered, not alone at the apprehensions he had been endeavoring to make his daughter share; not alone at a conviction of mingled folly and guilt, which swept not unfrequently through his heart with the force of a moral hurri-   NEVER A GAIN.         37 1 ane, but as much, or more, beneath a sense of intense per- sonal degradation, implied in this effort to play upon the innocent affection of his child-to deceive her loving heart to his own selfish ends. It is true stern necessity demanded it; but even if he secured his fame and fortune in the eyes of the public, would he dare to hold up his head again? He a gen- tleman! Bah! there was not a rag or tatter of the gentle- man left to him. He did not deceive himself--he knew that there was no refuge left for his self-love; but in a pretence of piety so strong as to impose somewhat upon himself, as the world, and a great increase in the fervor and frequency of his public devotions; he might-he would-make himself a loud-mouthed, active, energetic church member, but a gentle- man he could never be again.?People might consider him one, but he himself would always know better. It could hardly be said that he thought this all out in so many words upon the instant, but the substance of it flashed out upon his consciousness in a flare of light, and so he sat shivering and shrinking, a poor, sneaking, guilty thing, be- neath the gaze of his loving child. A noise in the hall aroused him. "Hush!" he exclaimed, as Helen was about to speak. "The Count is leaving. Rouse up, and smooth your collar and hair. Your mother will, per- haps, look in; she must not see you so discomposed. Recol- lect what I have told you is a profound secret. I will talk with you again, about it. There, now they have gone back into the parlor; you can run up stairs, and I must go down town. I am very late to-day." And Mr. Ledgeral hastily seized his hat and gloves, and nervously hurried Helen from'the room. He watched her as she slowly mounted the stairs, with one hand on the lalluster. If old Joseph had seen her he would have beep slow to accuse her movements of any excess of vivacity. Mr. Ledgeral, ob- tuse as he had become to all little external circumstances, could not but notice the change. He uttered a sigh, that was almost a groan, and dashed out of the front door, and down the steps, into the street.   iL CHAPTER   XIX. Lights and Shadows-An Accidental Rencontre-A Declaration-Very wrong in Luther to talk so-"Good-bye, sweetheart." F Helen had needed proof of the fact that the lights and shadows of sentiment and feeling often qualify for us the appearances of outside objects as markedly as the lights and shadows of Nature herself, she could have found it in the altered aspect of er room after the interview with her father. No one had enter eit since she had last left it, yet somehow there seemed to be a change. It was clearly not so bright and cheerful as usual. Carpet and paper-hanging had sud- denly grown dingy, and the curtains were evidently beginning to fade. The aureola of tender light which had always sur- rounded the little book-case, with its neatly-bound volumes, had vanished. Half-a-dozen engravings in carved oaken frames had assumed a thick, muddy tint. The canary saluted, as usual, the arrival of his mistress with a song, but his tones were screechy, and his tune badly turned. Helen glanced at the chandelier. Was the gas escaping? No; it was the odor of that pot of heliotrope in the window. How could she have thought it so pleasant an hour ago? The neat little French escritoire in bois de rose, no longer glittered with its usual lustre de Paris. After all, bois de rose is not a very handsome wood. It has not been run into the ground, with us Americans, like Palisandre, and we like it for its rarity and novelty; but it is'not really handsome. Helen seated herself at the desk, unlocked and rolled back the revolving top, and then listlessly opened and shut- the drawers one after the other. She turned over two or three   NE VER AGAN.          373 letters and flung them back into their places. She hauled out several manuscripts but replaced them without reading. She unlocked a secret drawer and took out the "Legend of Charlemagne," but after running down a page she put it back in its case and returned it to its hiding-place. What to do! What could the poor girl do? She sud- denly rested her arms upon the desk and buried her face in her hands, and thought-no, not thought, she only felt-felt as feels the young heart when for the first time comes the conviction, which sooner or later comes to all, that this world is not, as Mr. Whoppers would say, "what it is cracked up to be;" that it is not a globe of gilded and glorious glamour, made up of flowery meads and rainbow-tinted skies, and sun- touched clouds, and summer bieezes; but that it is a hard, rocky, earthquake-shaken, volcano-riven, tornado-swept, wreck- strewn ball, almost the smallest in size, leaving out of view the fragments of the great planetary " burst-up," and quite possibly the meanest in destiny of all the little globules of matter whirling within the limits of our comparatively contracted solar system. It is not pretended that Helen's thoughts wandered off in this absurdly astronomical fashion. Her thoughts, if she had ahy, would unquestionably have dealt only with the human and moral elements that enter into the composition of the world. But, as has been said, she felt rather than thought. No doubt there was a good deal of unconscious cerebration which, if it had been capable of expression, and if the quotation had not been so trite, might have vented itself in the verse:- "This world is all a fleeting show, For man's illusion given." But Helen did not think; she tried to, but' she couldn't; and as she had no taste for common-place, there was no ne- cessity for her to quote Tom Moore. She did, however, the best thing possible: she put her head down upon her folded arms and burst into a hearty fit of crying. In a few moments her tears fell fast, and deep   374         NEb'VE' AGA IN. sobs shook her frame. Suddenly she started. What if some one should come to her room? her mother, perhaps! It would be impossible to evade inquiry,and yet impossible to answer any questions as to the cause of her grief. Had not her father charged her to give no one the slightest intimation of the horrible secret? , She would slip out and first walk her- self into a more composed state of mind, and then stop for her visit at Aunt Shippen's. Helen jumped up, rearranged her hair and dress, and wetting the corner of a towel, carefully wiped the traces of tears from her cheeks. As she did this, and while putting on her hat and sack, she was conscious of treading more carefully, so that her steps should not be noticed by any one below in her mother's room; and she blushed at the thought; and she blushed still deeper as she held her room door open for a few minutes, and listened for the sound of any one on the stairs or in the hall, and then carefully closed it in silence. She felt like a guilty thing as she glided down the stairs; she had never been compelled to anything furtive before, and now the world of guilt and misery had laid its heavy hand upon her, and the touch she felt had sullied her soul. She had gone but a few blocks up from the quiet lower end of Fifth Avenue, when she began to be sensible of the thickening tide of fashion, and to get glimpses of the rush and whirl of life in the great artery that crossed at Twenty-third Street. She thought to herself that if she wished to escape the notice of strolling friends,' and enjoy, for a few minutes, a soli- tary walk, she had better turn into one of the cross streets. For a single block a double line of sombre brown-stone fronts, despite the individual littleness and meanness of their tall fa9ades, and the utter absence of unity or breadth of de- sign, glowered at each other with a certain stately uniformity of ugliness, quite in harmony with the deep shadows and solemn stillness of the narrow street. And here about the middle of the block occurred a coin- cidence-not one of those grand coincidences that distressed novelists so often employ, but o'ne of those little every-day,   NL- VER AGA IAr.        375 yet nevertheless curious coincidences that happen to almost everybody, and which has given rise to the prove-b in every language-"Talk of the devil--or rather speak or think of an angel and you will hear his wings." Now Helen was not ex- actly thinking of an angel, still less of the other fellow. She was not even thinking of Luther Lansdale. It is true she had accidentally encountered him once or twice before on the same street, as he was returning from business up among the large lumber-yards on the west side of the town. But, as he had explained, calls for that purpose, in fact calls up town in bus- iness hours for any purpose, were very rare; so that she could hardly have expected to encounter him. She was not then really thinking of him, at least not with that magnetic force, not with that volitional evolution of the odic influence which is supposed to be the only invocative of abodily presence. She was only thinking of Imma, and wondering what would have been the result, if the grim old Kaiser had cut Engenhard's head off, and had insisted upon his daughter marrying one of his paladins, say Ganelon the Faithless, or Ogier the Dane. She was thinking whether it was most probable that Imma would have refused and killed herself, or have submitted to her father's wishes and gone mad; and so absorbed was she in her thoughts that she did not notice the footstep of a gentle- man approaching from behind, until they were quite close to her, and a familiar voice exclaimed, "Good-morning, Miss Helen. I thought I could not be mistaken. I saw a figure that I knew must be yours, and I have ventured to follow you to say good-morning, and inquire after your health." "Thank you, SIr. Lansdale, I am quite well. It would seem hardly right to feel otherwise such a lovely day. But you-I don't think that you are looking quite as well as usual." "Don't you? Well, I am conscious of feeling a little worn'and dragged out lately." . "You work too hard, and perhaps apply yourself to your duties and your studies too closely." i "No, but I have had a good deal to worry me during the past week."   376        NEVER AGAIN. "I don't suppose any one can escape worry and trouble in this life," replied Helen, speaking in a reflecting and ques. tioning, rather than a sententious and dogmatic tone. Luther took an eager step forward, and bowed his head so -as to front a little more fully the fair face, but he instantly drew back again. He knew that anything impressive in gesture or movement would draw the close scrutiny of a hundred pair of eyes from behind the curtains of the second-story windows. Besides, the scraps of lace, flowers, and feathers, called bon. nets afford little or no excuse for craning one's head into a lady's face in walking-no protruding frames or protecting cheek-pieces to look round, as in the old-fashioned times. "Everything is open and above-board," as Captain Combing said in discussing the subject. "Yes," or as you might say, "flush from ear to ear," replied Whoppers. "I suppose if it wern't for the name of the thing, the women would all go bareheaded." Luther drew back, and resumed a proper, nonchalant erectness, but he could not discard a tone of affectionate solici- tude from his voice, as he said, "And you, Helen,-Miss Ledg- eral I mean,- you have trouble too! Nothing very serious has happened, I hope?" Helen looked up at him and simply nodded her head. "I knew it," passionately exclaimed Luther. "I knew  the moment I saw you. I saw that something was the mattei -I saw it in your gait-in your eyes, in your smile. Now tell me what it is. Is it anything in which I can help you? Can I do anything for you; or can I help you by-by,"- Luther hesitated, and the blood rushed to cheek and brow, while a sympathetic blush flashed over Helen's face-" by not doing-that is, by-by-avoiding to do something?" Helen made no reply, and they walked along afew steps in silence. "I know it is presumption," said Luther, " but may I not ask if I have anything to do with your trouble? You don't speak-you won't answer me. I am sure you can trust me." Still no answer.' '   ,   NEVE R AGAIN.         3" "Believe me, Helen," continued Luther after a pause. "I am capable of much in the way of self-sacrifice. I feel that I could sacrifice anything and everything for you. I could sacrifice all my prospects in life-life itself, and what is infi- nitely harder, my love." As he uttered the last word Luther's voice sank almost to a whisper, but had assumed the clear thrilling tone of passion which has passed the hesitating or husky stage.  "Yes, my love; Helen, my love,-and God knows I love you, and He alone ever can know how much and how well, and with what a fierce, desperate, but unselfish -love. I thought never to make the avowal, and least of all at this time and place, but I cannot help it. It bursts from my heart without my will. But it can do you no harm. I expect noth- ing from you. I ask for nothing in return. I know how hopeless my love is, and must be,-I have known it for three years,-ever since our first encounter that fatal night on the Hudson,-three long years of passionate, but hopeless love." A low cry of suppressed feeling forced its way through the young girl's lips. "Oh, oh, Mr. Lansdale,-Luther," she exclaimed, " don't, don't speak so! You must not say such wors to me; and here, at this time. Oh, it's unkind! It is ungenerous!" and Helen felt disposed for a moment to defy the proprieties of the public street, and raising her hands to her face, indulge in a good sob.  Ungenerous? yes it was ungenerous in Luther to make such a declaration at a time and place when her hands were tied so that she could not make even the slighest gesture,-when her feet were restricted to a steady walking pace,-when every feature had to be held in the rigid lines of a mask to a heart full of boiling emotion. Oh! if he had chosen some place where she could have thrown herself upon his breast, and hidden her confusion, and confessed her feelings in the shad- ows of a loving embrace! Truly the street is a very poor place for a declaration of love. It does very, well for a simple proposal of marriage, and no doubt many a very excetInt and sensible affair has  s ,              -   ,   378        ATL VER AGAIN. been arranged there; and no doubt many a protracted flirta. tion has culminated there, and either flared up, or fizzled away into a slow-match,-but for a declaration of downright pas sionate love, the street is not a good place. And it is much worse for the gentleman than it is for the lady. He has to depend almost entirely upon words, and that is the thing that he is generally weakest in. The eyes are of no account; the hands are sadly hampered; and there is, as Hosea Biglow might say, no "hitching up closer." 'No, the street is a poor place to make a declaration in, except when acceptance orre. jection is a mere toss of a copper on both sides. "No, no; not ungenerous, nor yet unkind," exclaimed Luther, "but foolish-thoughtless. I forgot myself You will forgive me, Helen? You will forget that I have been so weak, so silly. But you are in trouble, and how could I resist saying what I should not have dared to say at any other time? You will forgive me, won't you? And you will let me ask you again if it is anything that I may know--anything that I can help you in?" "You are very kind, Luther, but you must never talk so to me again. It is very wrong, and very improper, or rather it would be very wrong and improper for me to listen to you. Father would be very angry with me. You don't know al the circumstances. You never can know," exclaimed Hele in a mournful tone, and with a sudden sinking of the voice, "all the circumstances." "Circumstances!" exclaimed Luther, "Aye, that's the word. Circumstances! I know them too well. I don't pre- tend to the slightest hope, or even wish to resist them. I would like to alter them, but of that I have only the most distant prospect. Defy them! I might if I alone were in- terested; but not when your interests, and tastes, and habits, and happiness are concerned. Your father thinks you a match for the best, and highest, and richest in the land-and he is right. And why should I, who love you so well and so truly,-permit me to say it just this once,-I who love you as you will never be loved agan,---why should I think or wish to prevent your proper destiny?"   NEVER AGAIN.-         379 Somewhat of bitter feeling Luther could not prevent show- ing itself in the emphatic cadences of his voice. Helen made no reply, and for half a block they walked in silence. At length she raised her eyes with a timid furtive glance. ' I should like to say something," she murmured, " if-if-you would not misunderstand. I would not have you think that I am such a poor slave of the world-of society-of conven- tionality as-as-" Luther made an energetic gesture. "No, no," exclaimed Helen, hurriedly. I will not say -I need not say-what might be under ordinary, circumstan- ces. But I would like to have you know that in anything I may do I am constrained by powers that I cannot resist." "Your father!" demanded Luther. "No, no; not my father-but it is a secret-a terrible se- cret." And again both were silent for some steps. "May I ask," suddenly exclaimed Luther, "if the right parti has shown himself? It is impertinent, I own, but, Helen, haven't I a right to know as much as that? No, not a right. I have no rights-but don't I deserve to be trusted a little?" Helen glanced up in the eager face of her companion with an imploring expression that was more eloquent than any word could have been. "Yes, I see it is so," said Luther, "and I know now," he continued with sudden vehenience, and striking one hand into the palm of the other, "who it is. Yes, Whoppers warned me, and he was right. It is that young German Count." "You have no right to say so," exclaimed Helen. "No- body has any right to say so; and I won't allow it. He has been friendly with me, but nothing more; and there is no prospect of his being-" This last phrase had a slight inclination towards a fib, and Helen knew it, and hastened with clever self-imposition to connect it with a phrase having in it truth enough to restore the general rectitude of the sentence. "-And there is no prospect of his being; and I have no   380        NEVER AGA IN. wish that he should be ; and I don't want my name connected with his in any such way. But we have had enough of this talk; it is not right ; and it is of no use. It can do neither of us any good. Let us talk about something else. You say you have been worried and troubled the past week; what has been the cadse of that? Nothing has gone wrong down in Burling Slip?" "No; but I have had a terrible thing happen to me. I have lost my best friend. "I told you," continued Luther, after a pause," about the old Frenchswoman, Madame Steignitz. I wish you could have known her. No description of mine would doher justice. You would have been much interested in her. I don't say that you would have liked her, but I have learned not only to like her, but to love her, and certainly if any one owes a heavy debt of gratitude to a friend, I do to her. Well, she has gone." "Dead!" exclaimed Helen. "I don't know," replied Luther, "I hope not; I doubt if she is dead. I hardly know what to think, but she is gone, and we can find no trace of her." "That is very strange: did she never say anything to you, indicating an intention to leave the city?"  "Not a word," replied Luther. "I was with her the even- ing before. We took leave of each other, both expecting to meet the very next evening. When I went there, her door was locked. I waited till ten o'clock, when I began to think it strange, but I was not fully alarmed until the next morning. I am quite sure that she has been carried off. I have my suspicions, but I cannot make the police share them. I have offered a reward of all the money I can command, but it is not enough to make any of the clever detectives take hold of the matter with any energy, and now I am going to devote myself to the affair. I have given notice to Mr. Gainsby that I must have leave for a month. If they don't choose to grant it, why they must find some one for my place. One thing; I am going to find her if she is living, or ferret out and punish her assassins if she is dead."   NEVER AGAIN.          38 "Won't there be a good deal of danger in such an affair?" demanded Helen. "Perhaps. The parties whom I suspect are a pretty des- perate set, and I don't suppose they will surrender their prey readily." Helen slipped her hand, quite unconsciously, into Luther's arm.  "Why not leave the whole matter to the police?" she de- manded. "I will undertake to make father and Uncle Ship- pen contribute towards a reward that will interest the services of the whole force." Luther looked at the little hand resting upon his arm won- deringly, when it was quietly withdrawn, and he dropped his own hand with a sigh. "No; you would not advise me to do that if you knew how much I love her; and besides I am satisfied that the police are really incapable of conducting the search. They have made a spasmodic effort or two in the line of burglars and thieves, and that more at my instance than of their own good will. They won't believe that the old woman has been abducted. They think she has gone off herself and will turn up in good time. No, I am satisfied that she has been carried off, and I am satisfied that none of the regular members of the so-called criminal class have had anything to do with it." "But may it not be that the police are in the right, and that she has gone off herself, and will return when she gets ready? I recollect you told me yourself that she was very queer." "Yes, that is true; but I can't explain, at this time, all the reasons that make me think that it is a case of violent abduction, and I cannot make the police feel the force of them. Because there are no doors broken open, and no draw- ers rifled, and no property stolen, they won't listen to me." Luther and his companion had returned on their steps, and were now very near to Fifth Avenue. They walked as slowly as possible, but still five minutes at most would put them in the tide of the brilliant thoroughfare.   382        NEVER AGAIN. "( We must part in a few moments, as I am expected at Aunt Shippen's," said Helen. "Tell me how I can learn the result of your quest-how I can learn from day to day of your safety." "And you wish, Helen, to hear of me?" exclaimed Luther, eagerly. "You take interest enough in me to care for mny s ifety?" "How can I help it? But, Luther Lansdale, don't mis- take me; I have been very weak to-day, very foolish; to let you talk as-you have; I am not going to do so any more. As a friend I shall always like to hear of you ; but now that you are going into peril, as I know you are, it would be strange if I should not wish to hear something of your doings." Wicked and improper thoughts will occasionally flash across the minds of the best of men. We cannot all help that. Enough if we vigorously resist them. In this way Luther thought for an instant of proposing to Helen to meet him at stated times in the street. It was a foolish thought as well as wicked, for what chance was there that such a girl would consent to such a thing? The idea was a profanation of that divinity which, in his imagination, did hedge her in, and his cheek grew red with shame as he stammered out- "You are kind-too kind-bvt I don't know how. I shan't-I can't-see you, I suppose?" "No," interrupted Helen. "I have promised father-that is, I have as good as promised him-that all intercourse be- tween us should cease. You cannot know--you never call know--the reasons that make him exact this of me, and make me consent to his wishes. You need not look so scornful and so incredulous. There is a great and terrible secret that I can never tell. But I have just thought of a way. Mr. Whoppers is still your friend?" "Yes ; and he is going to assist me in this matter of Ma- dame Steignitz." "Well, then, I shall see him sometimes, and he shall tel: me of you. Good-bye." Helen held out her hand. Luther took it in his, held it   ANE VER A GAIN.         383 for a moment, limp and nerveless, in his half-closed fingers, and then let it slip from his grasp. For a moment they looked into the depths of each other's eyes, and then, without other speech, simultaneously turned away and moved off in different directions. "Not much feeling in that quarter," was the mental com- ment of a gentleman passing. "Brother and sister, perhaps, and no love lost at that." He little thought what a tremendous sacrifice was taking place before his eyes upon the altar of the "Proper." Boggs always maintained that there was more downright self-denial in the worship of the great Pam-bam-sham than in the services of any church in the city. I v                        CHAPTER XX. A Hark-hound-More Nuisance-Mrs. Doolan and Mrs. Macarty-Fifth 1it     Avenue Meanness-A slight Clue. " T'S a big job you have undertaken," exclaimed Whop. pers, as he and Luther sat in consultation at a late hour in the editorial sanctum; "and the chances, I can tell you, are decidedly against you. Still, I don't advise you to give it up; but to do anything you must do it artistically and understandingly." How so?" "Why, in the first place, you must get all the stories by Dickens and others of detective exploits, and read up. Fill your mind with instances of secret passages, and mysterious noises, and dubious clues, and wonderful coincidences, and subtle expedients, and delicate intuitions, and happy guesses; and, to crown all, you must resolve upon the most indomita- ble persistence and the most brilliant audacity." "Pshaw!" exclaimed Luther pettishy. "Well, 'pshaw!' perhaps it is mostly; but still there is something in it. It is a real land of adventure, and why shouldn't story-tellers make the most of it. They may have overdone it perhaps, but it is a cardinal principle of detective- ism to despise hints from no quarter, and you will find some general notions by which you may profit. I suppose you have read all that kind of stuff?" "Oh, lots of it," replied Luther impatiently. "Well, then you know all about the paraphernalia-old clothes, false whiskers, dyed hair, slouched hats, revolvers, spring daggers, and dark lanterns-eh?   b NEVER AGAIN.         385 "Now don't get mad-your real detectives never let their angry passions rise. Seriously, however, I don't see how you are to get along without going through something of the usual routine, and I don't think you can do it alone. Just look at the case for a moment. You -are young and good-looking. No compliment; I didn't call you handsome, so you need not rise and return thanks. You are a pretty smart young fellow, and know a heap of things, but you are woefully ignorant on many points. Why, in the great field of poverty and vice and crime which underlies all the shiny conventionalities of city life, you are just as green as grass. What do you know of the real habits, manners, feelings, or even language, of any one of the various denizens of our vast tenement-house popu- lation? and still more, what do you know of the strictly so- called dangerous, or criminal classes? Have you been in the habit of frequenting the haunts of vice? Do you know where our haunts of vice are situated? Do you know a haunt of vice when you see it? What do you know about the drinking- saloons and the gambling-houses, to say nothing of the thieves' dens, and the holes and hiding-places of utter desperate ruf- fianism? Now, your are going to look for two men-probably desperate characters, foreigners, certainly-of whose person- ality you have only the faintest idea; you are not even sure that you will be able to recognize, either of them when you see them." "But the voice! you forget," replied Luther. "I am sure of the voice." "Well, that is something; but I don't see how you are to find your game by the ear alone. By-the-by, that suggests something. Did you ever hear of a hark-hound?" "No." "Nor I either." "But is there such an animal as the hark-hound?" impa- tiently demanded Luther. "Well, I don't suppose there is." "What the devil do you ask such a question for then?" "Why, your remark about knowing the fellow's voice sug- 25'   386        NEV yIER A GA I,. gested the idea that such a thing as a hark-hound might be made. We have the gaze-hound and the scent-hound-dogs in which the senses of sight and'smell have been enormously developed-why could we not, by proper breeding, develop the sense of hearing in the same way, and get a dog that could hunt by ear-a veritable hark-hound? Artificial selec- tion for a few generations would do it, and what a valuable thing when done! I have a great mind to give up journalism and devote the rest of my life to making a lhark-hound." "Pish! Why do you turn all things into a joke?-" "Joke! You miscomprehend. I never was more serious. And besides I never try to turn all things into a joke. I only try to turn a joke into all things. There is a distinction for you. Dull people can't see it. Don't you make the same mistake. You are impatient because the idea of a hark-hound whisked across my fancy-well, we will hark back to our sub- ject. I don't see how you are to prosecute your quest with- out a companion.- If I could go with you-but I can't. I think we must secure the services of a detective. And yet I don't know any one, and I know the whole force, that is ex- actly the man." "No," replied Luther, "I have had enough to do with the police lately. They are all so taken up with their own theo- ries and conclusions that an outsider like myself can't get an idea in edgeways." "Well, it is evident that you must undertake the job in some character; prosecute it upon some system. You can- not go about in your present style of clothes; you would at once arouse suspicion, excite remark, and get yourself into plenty of trouble."  A great many plans were now canvassed, and all the pros and cons considered. Mr. Whoppers was really a man of re- source. His occupation, for years, as a reporter on the staff of a noted daily newspaper had given him a fund of informa tion, all applicable in this case. Luther could hardly have had ^s adviser any one more thoroughly posted in all the de- tails of New York low life.   ArE VE R A GA I.        387 "I'll tell you what, Luther, we need not decide upon any special plan for ultimate operations now. One thing is per- fectly clear: that you must first find out what has become of the old inventor. You can begin regularly to-morrow, and see what success you have. You won't need any disguise for that. But begin at the beginning; visit the house, search his room thoroughly, aird look out for the slightest clue. And now to. bed, but not to dream. Discharge thy mind, for the night, of this perilous stuff. I see it worries you-you are growing thin. If you get into a nervous state you may as well give it up. Many is the battle that has been lost by a clever general because he allowed the responsibilities of the case to worry and flurry him. Not that the thing is entirely volun- tary. Take two cases-one a general with plenty of brains, universal information, and an astonishing fecundity in the way of brilliant plans, and all combined with the highest physical courage ; but when it comes to action the blood goes to his brain in too great quantities, he gets excited, and thinks and feels too fast and too much; that is, he has the brains of a general. The other fellow is rather dull, and don't know a great deal, but action exerts an elevating and soothing influ- ence upon him. He thinks quicker, and calculates and com- bines more accurately under the moderate stimulus of the battle-field. He has not the brains of a great general, but he has the temperament. Now and then you have a fellow with the brains and temperament united, and then you have one of those great generals that appear, on an average, about one to a century. "Now, in this matter, I admit nature is powerful, but still much can be done by art-coolness can be cultivated. The habit of throwing off, pro femt., all pressure upon the mind, can be acquired. Don't let anything worry you or flurry you ; don't let the moral dominate too strongly over the intellectual. Look around you. Who are the rulers of our city? Who are the wise men, the great men, the men whom all good citizens delight to honor with place and profit-are they the men who permit the moral- to dominate too strongly over the intellect-   388        NEV E:VITR ACGAIN. ual? Go thou, my son, and do likewise. Sleep the sleep of a Gothamite made alderman, and awake to thy labors with brain and body invigorated and strengthlened for the day." "Sleep!" exclaimed Luther; "you may say sleep, but I don't believe I shall close my eyes to-night ; I can't get the old woman out of my head." "I can tell you how to get rid of her. Suppose we go out and get half-a-dozfn raw oysters, and a pint of brown stout. You'll sleep like a top, and your head in the morning will be as clear as a bell. You won't? Then I can tell you another plan. It is homceopathic-similia similibus, you know. , To drive the old woman out of your head, suppose you let a young one in. You deceitful young humbug! it isn't the old woman that will keep you awake to-night. I am sorry for you. If I was in your place I'd bar up every avenue to sense with two pints of porter sobner than let her in." "And would you bar up with two pints every night?" "Yes, for a month." "But suppose it was for six months-a year,-five years?" "Ah! Luther,"' exclaimed Mr. Whoppers in a mournful tone, and taking the young man by the hand, as he stood with one foot on the stairs ready to mount to his room,--" ah, Luther, is it really so bad as that? Has the shaft flown home to the very vitals? I did not think it. Shakespeare has de- ceived me. I do not see your hose ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe untied, and ev- erything about you demonstrating a careless desolation. Well, in that case porter won't help you. You do right not to apply to the bar,--you must carry your load yourself until you get rid of it in the natural way. I've carried the same load my- self; it is always relieved, and by the same process." "What process?" demanded Luther. "It dwindles. Ah yes," continued Mr. Whoppers with a mournful shake of the head,--" it dwindles. Like an Irish dirt-cartman, you jolt along some distance over the stones of life to a distant dumping-ground, and you find you have noth- ing to dump;-it has all leaked out by the way.   NiVER Fl A GIN.4       389 "One moment, my dear boy," continued Mr. Whoppers, holding on to Luther, who was pulling himself away to ascend the stairs,-" one moment and I can bid you good-night with, a clear conscience. Everything is like and unlike everything else in this world. I have told you why you are like an Irish- man carting dirt. Can you tell me why you are unlike him? In this : that you have all your dumps at the beginning of your course, and he all his at the end. "Luther, Luther," shouted Mr. Whoppers as Luther tore himself away and bounded up the stairs,-" what says Theoc- ritus? 'There is no salve, O Nicias, or plaster or other rem- edy for love than the Muses.' Write some poetry. That's a good fellow. It's not only a remedy for love, but for sleep- lessness. Have pen and paper at your bedside,'like Pope, and every time you turn over, turn out and turn a couplet, and then turn back again, and keep turning,--you may be sure it will all turn out right in the end. Luther! Luther!-" "Well, what is it?" "Ding-dong! Ding-dong! Don't you hear it? Turn again, Lansdale, Lord AMayor of New York." "Oh, go to the devil!" "Too long a journey. I'll turn in," and Mr. Whoppers, chuckling with pleasure at having provoked Luther's parting exclamation, re-entered his room. Early morning found Luther at the house in Wooster street. He had never before visited it at that hour, and had never before fully noted the marks of dilapidation and decay. It seemed as if the ten days' absence of the owner had worked a great change for the worse, but in reality th!ere was very lit- tle change. A trifle more dirt perhaps-three or four freshy broken panes stuffed with rags or paper, and the rickety newel-post of the balusters wrenched out and missing; but, beyond these comparatively trifling strides on the road to ruin, everything remained the same. The tenants were more than usually orderly and quiet. Instinctively they had combined to prevent all suspicion of anything unusual in the house, and to the inquiries of the po-    390        NEVER A GAIN. lice, they one and all expressed-their conviction that Madame Steignitz had gone off of her own will for a short trip, and would soon return. They scouted the idea of there being anything in her absence that called for an investigation by the authorities. Their unanimity on this point was curious; es. pecially*s they had never actually put their heads together in council; and as each one really had strong hopes that they might never see the old woman again. But, from the fighting couple upstairs to the cobbler in the basement, one and all agreed that there was not the slightest ground for suspicion of foul play. The conviction that, if they could keep matters quiet, the disappearance of the landlady might mean weeks and perhaps months of free quarters, was strong enough to bridle the tongues of the women, even when talking among themselves. "A bright mornin' an! a fresh one to yees," said Mrs. Macarty, the charwoman, to Mrs. Dennis Doolan, the tailor's wife, as. they met on the landing. "Yer walkin' I see, by the basket on yer arm; an' it's quite early indade." "An' it's early I'm forced to be," replied Mrs. Doolan. "Ye see my brother-in-law's cousin is cook to the Hagans in the Fifth Avenue, an' I've to go up early to receive the little perkisites. Ould Hagan, ye must know, was never edicated; an' shure it's a great misfortune for a gintleman not to have an edication. He was a butcher wonst, an' now the ould vil- lain prowls round in the dusk o' the mornin' like a hyena, or a cat-o'-nine-tails." "Oh, but he's the rich one." "Rich! He rolls in gould; ye can hear the bank-notes crinkle every step he takes; and -Mrs. Forlie, who is my brother-in-law's cousin, twice removed, tells me that just the gould and the silver and the chinee in that house would build a cathaydral." "  Well, I don't believe that he's as rich as the old one who is, that is who was, above," replied Mrs. Macartv, signifi- cantly jerking her thumb upwards. "Whist! my dear. It doesn't do for us to be canvass- ing the melrits of our shuperiors."   NElVER A GA IN.        391 "Ah, never fear,-the lamentable- occurrence will never pass my lips; but I was just thinking who will collect the rent in the end? There is that young man who used to visit her so often : will he call for the money?" "No, sure ; he las no idea of the kind. He is just as puzzled as we and more. The old lady has gone, and has evadintly left no power. We must just rest aisy ontil her re- turn, which in my opinion, Mrs. Macarty, and I say it to you in confidence, is shure but may not be spaidy. Now you go out a grate dale into the world, and you see a grate dale of society, and I don't think it will be becoming in you, any more than in me, to indulge; during her absence, in any idle and unnecessary conjactures about the rint." "I quite agree with you, Mrs. Doolan. It is a subject bet- ter to think over, than to talk about. A pleasant morning's walk to you, ma'am, and may you find your cousin's arms greased to her elbows," and Mrs. Macarty gave a sly and sig- nificant wink. "Ah! it's but little grease that you can find in old Hagan's larder," replied Mrs. Doolan with a mournful shake of the head as she descended the stairs. "The old villain makes a barrel o' soft soap every three months with his own hands." "Och, that is despisable; I didn't know that the old cow- skinner was so mean as that." "Mean! Why it's meaner than that he is. Perhaps you wouldn't believe it without my affidavy, but it's as true as gos- pel, that he sweetens his tay wid powdered sugar just to keep any honest and desarving individual from pocketing a. few lumps from the sugar-pot. Whist! here is the young man now. It's onaisy in his mind he is, or he'd niver put his head in his hat so early in the morning. Don't let him cajole ye, Mrs. Macarty."  "Divil the word, my dear." "Goodmornin', sir," replied Mrs. Doolan to Luther's salutation. "It's good news you have of the madam, I'm sure. And ye havn't heard of her? Well, it's queer in her, anyhow, to run off so widout letting you know; but thim fur   392        NEVER AGAINV. rinners are always peculiar. She'll bring back news of her. self. We'll see her in a few days trotting up and down these stairs, and dunning the rint as usual. Well, she'll find every- thing kept nice and. dacent for her, and no row in the house. 'I'm sure she'd not like to find any of us had been making a rumpus about her. And it's Mr. Planly you want to inquire about-the little man with one eye? No! Ah! well the tall man? I mind me now--about six months ago--wasn't it, Mrs. Macarty?" "Six months or a year," replied Mrs. Macarty, from the head of the stairs. "Six months!" replied Luther. "Why you told me your- self that you saw him removing his things not three weeks ago." "Did I? I thought it was the other one shure. Which one? Why the bald-headed one. Shure I've no memory for names; and what with looking after the old man and six children, I never know who comes and goes in the house." Luther, finding that nothing could be made out of the two women, mounted the stairs, pulled out the key, which he had taken possession of since Madame Steignitz' disappearance, and unlocking the door entered her room. Everything re- mained pretty much as it was the evening of his last German lesson. About the same amount of confusion and disorder, slightly aggravated by the visit which he had induced the po- lice to pay to the house, but no marks of personal violence, or any indications that could serve as a clue to certain mysteri- ous circumstances that marked the case. It had been upon a second visit, two or three days after his last interview with the old lady, that Luther, finding her door still locked, began to be alarmed. He at once made inquiries of the inmates of the house. No one had seen anything of her. He clambered out of the window of the empty room formerly occupied by Mr. Planly, and made his way along by the roof to the window of the old lady's room, and looked in. He could not raise the window,' for it was fast- ened by the catch which he had himself put on ; but he could   NArE VER A GAI         393 look over the half-curtain of spotted muslin and satisfy himself that no one was moving within. The conclusion would have been irresistible that the occupant had gone out, and had not yet returned, were it not for one circumstance. Upon examin- ing the door it was evident that the key was in the lock within. Luther decided to open the door, and for this purpose went out and secured the services of a neighboring locksmith, and to give an air of legality to the affair, invited the com- pany of the policeman of the beat. The locksmith readily in- serted his nippers and turned the key, still the door would not open. It was not only locked, but bolted. Luther explained that the bolt was a tiny piece of brass, and would readily give way to moderate pressure; but bursting open a door by main force was too serious a thing to be done in such an in- formal manner, and the policeman advised a resort to head- quarters. Upon Luther's representation of his relations to the old lady, and his suspicions of something wrong, the proper officer was deputed to accompany him 'and force an entrance. Noth- ing, however, was-found that could assist conjecture as to the truth of the case. "The door is fastened on the inside; she could not have gone out through that," argued Luther. "The window is fastened down ; she,could not have gone out of that," replied the police. It was mysterious, it was true, but then so many mysteries turn up every day that in the end are susceptible of easy solu- tion; and besides there was no money in the case; and, more than that, all thoughts were occupied with two terrible affairs of recent occurrence-a great bank robbery and a murder- twenty thousand dollars offered in, rewards, besides the pros- pect of immense collateral pickings. Luther, even assisted by Mr. Whoppers, could make no impression; and, moreover, he was for the first few days by no means assured, in his own mind, that the police were not right, and that the old-woman would not reappear of herself and explain the matter satisfactorily. But as time went on he   394        NE vER I A GAIN. became more and more convinced that she had been foully dealt with; and now, on the tenth day since her disappear- ance, he sat in his accustomed seat at the little old pine table, and as he looked around felt himself more and more strength- ened in his determination to devote himself to the investiga- tion of the affair. As he raised his head he glanced at the dormer window ' and started almost with fright, so clearly and with such inten- sity did memory reproduce the image of that face which he had seen one night, for an instant, pressed against the glass. He got up and closely examined the window. She could not have gone out of the door and left it bolted behind her, that was clear. She must have gone out of the window. But how, when it was fastened on the inside? He had previously tried to shove back the catch from the outside with a slender knife-blade, but had not succeeded. But if the Window could not be unfastened, might it not be that it could be fastened from the outside? He proceeded to examine the catch care- fully. He satisfied himself that with a knife, or even a piece of curved wire, the thing could not be done; but-with a piece od twine? Yes, with a piece of twine, no doubt. And, by heavens! what is that? A delicate film of hemp--half the size of a fine hair and less than a third of an inch long- sticking to the catch-plate! Luther picked it out carefully. No tress of maiden's hair was ever more electric. The tiny fragment sent a tingling sensation through his whole frame; and there, in the gutter below, lay a piece of twine. Luther stared at it for some moments in silence before he raised the window, and with trembling hand secured it. A mixed emo- tion, partly of wonder that he should not have noticed it be- fore, and partly of real fright, as if the dirty string was a thing living and venomous, held him motionless. At length he pulled out a slender filament and compared it with the one taken from the catch. Oh for a microscope! But as far as sharp eyes went he could see no difference, or only what might be attributed to the mud and dust of the gutter in which the twine had been half buried.   NE VER' AGAIN.        395 At any rate he would try it. He put the string round the batch, and then pushed the two ends out between the upper and lower sash. He 'then raised the lower sash, got out upon the roof, and closed the window behind him. A moderate pull upon the cord dangling from the crack between the sashes now drew the catch into its place, and then, by releas- ing one end and pulling upon the other, the whole string came away readily, leaving the window firmly fastened. Luther tried the window. Yes, it was firmly fastened. He satisfied himself of that fact, and theh crept along the roof to the window of the other room. That, too, was fast- ened. He recollected that he had nailed it up himself His experiment had succeeded better than he had anticipated. He had decidedly barred himself out. What was he to do? He did not dare creep over the roofs to the windows of any of the other houses; he might be taken for a burglar and compelled to make his explanations. That would be absurd, to say the least. No; better break the pane of glass over the catch and let himself in. But first he would see if he could make his situation known to any of the inmates of the house. He stretched himself at length upon the roof, and drew himself down until his face projected over the gutter, and his eye could command a view of the windows and the back door directly below. Really, a nice position for a genteel young man; flat on his breast on the roof of a tenement-house, to the great endam- agement of a clean shirt-bosom and a new necktie, and cran- ing over the dirty gutter into a range of deplorable back slums, and liable, if seen from the other houses, to have a hue and cry of "Burglar!" raised at his expense. But suppose certain other persons could see him-suppose Helen Ledgeral could see him? would a consideration of the real danger of his position, and of the lofty sentiments of right and duty which had led him into it, counterpoise in her mind what might at first seem the absurd and the ridiculous? At any rate, he would rather that she should see him than that Whoppers should. Whoppers would be sure to bore him about '   .      ',   9yu        IVA Vt. K A GAIN. his attack of gutter serena, with allusions to the dangers of eavesdropping; and would perhaps indite an article for the Universe upon " the absurd positions men are sometimes led into in the pursuit of knowledge." There was no let up to Whoppers. He had one terrible talent-the talent of threshing out the smallest sheaf of wit into countless bushels of chaff. Luckily Mrs. Macarty soon showed herself upon the back porch. She seemed at first a little dubious as to whether the hail that reached her ear from above was human or not, but Luther after a while succeeded in satisfying her on that point, and in making her comprehend that he wanted her to come up stairs and unfasten the window for him. It was clear now to his mind that the old lady had made her exit through the window, and he was also satisfied that it had not been done with her own free will. The man with the horrible face had no doubt been the principal actor, and the suspicion that Mr. Pianly's visitor, whom he had encountered several times on the stairs, was also connected with the affair, broadened in Luther's mind as he considered all the circulm- stances. There had clearly been no robbery. Drawers and clothes had probably been opened and examined, but as far as could be seen hardly anything had been disturbed, and nothing taken. There was no derangement of the furniture - every- thing looked to Luther's eye in about its usual disorderly condition, with the exception perhaps of the bed, which seemed to be more tumbled and pulled about than he had ever noticed it before. It could not then be a case of robbery, but-and the few words in that foreign voice that he had first heard from Mr. Planly's room rang in his ears-might it not well be that she had fallen victim to some scheme  to extort money from her, or perhaps,-and Luther shuddered at the thought,-to put her out of the way forever, and secure her estate ? Evidently the first thing to do was to find Mr. Planly. A closer examination of his room afforded not the slightest clue. A    few screws, some bits of wood and brass, and two or three broken boxes were all the evidences that remained of his former occupancy.   Luther resolved to question every inmate of the house; even the children. It was wonderful the apparent stolidity, but real cunning with which the examination on all hands was met. A universal suspicion that there might be danger in answering any questions had converted all the inmates of the house of Irish descent into a perfect community of know-noth- ings. The Alsacian cobbler in the basement, however, was a little more communicative, and the more so as Luther ad- dressed him in French. He recollected seeing the effects of Mr. Planly brought down stairs early one morning, some two weeks before, and placed upon a cart. He was not sure it was a cart; thought it had four wheels; did not observe any number upon it,-it might be a furniture van, but his impres- sion was that it was an unlicensed country wagon. Still it might be, upon second thought, a cart; was pretty sure there was but one horse, although there might have been two. The driver, who aide:Mr. Planly in bringing down his things, there was less uncertaIIy about. He was a large, stout' man with red whiskers; could recollect nothing else curious or charac- teristic.       5 All this was not very encouraging. In fact it was- down- right discouraging. But don't your true detective begin al- most always under discouraging circumstances ? What would the famous AIr. Waters do in such a case ? Why he'd can- vass the city until he had found out every stout red-whiskered drayman in town. And what if he should light upon the right man in the end ? Why, that would prove that Mr. Planly had moved out of town, and narrow the question down to Hoboken and Jersey City on the west, and Brooklyn and Williamsburg on the east, with a chance of Morrisania on the north. "Don't you see," said MAr. Whoppers, who was at the breakfast-table? when Luther returned from his morning per- quisitions, " don't you see that it will be an immense stride ? It will eliminate the great city of New York from the prob- lem. You can then attack the neighboring towns, and elimi- nate them in succession. It may be something of a job, to be sure, but patience and perseverance! Faint heart never won an old lady."   398        NE'VER, AGA IN. "Let us see, however, if we have not forgotten something," continued Mr. Whoppers, "something which should be at. tended to first. You think that Madame Steignitz has been taken out of the window of her room, and I am rather in- clined to agree with you. Well, dead ol alive, she must have been taken into the window of some other house in the row. Now, I think it would be best to find out who occupy the attic rooms of the other houses." The suggestion of Mr. Whoppers was an excellent one, but Luther found great difficulty in carrying it out. His first idea was to secure the aid of an officer, but to this there were several objections. The 'main one being, that it would excite a general commotion in the street, and for the present it was a great object to keep everything quiet, and not to alarm the guilty parties, whoever they might be. Although his visits to the house of Madame Steignitz had been almost always made in the evening, it was not improbable that his person was well known to many of the inmates of ti!ther houses, and if he should undertake the investigation in the company of an officer suspicion would be excited, and a degree of publicity given to the matter, that would render it impossible to obtain any correct information. For this reason Luther resolved to go alone, avowedly with the object of looking for rooms. Several attic rooms were vacant. He was repeatedly in- formed he must apply to the agent, who had an office at the foot of the street. But the distance was too great, or Luther too ignorant, and so he blundered on into the inhabited rooms with his inquiries, Jin a few instances meeting with rather rude rebuffs, but generally getting courteous answers, and in many cases, thanks to his youth and good looks, he was allowed a long gossiping conversation. Still he could- obtain no infor- mation that, as far as he could see; had any bearing upon, or connection with, the matter in hand. In fact everything that lie could see and hear rather went to excite a doubt as to whether the old lady, if she had gone out of her own window, could have gone into any other. Clearly she must have been carried over the roof to the farthest extremity of the block. f   NEVE R AGAIN. G 4I.399 [ There was but one house left. Well, he would make a finish of that, and then to take up the quest for Mr. Pianly. He mounted, as usual, directly to the garret. The click- ing of a sewing-machine sounded from one of the rooms. Luther had but little idea of any difference between hand- sewing and machine-sewing. He knew nothing of the myste- ries of single and double lock-stit ch. He knocked at the door, and expected to see it opened by the delicate, refined, consumptive-looking gentlewoman of his last novel, and was not a little astonished at being confronted by a fat, ruddy- cheeked, good-looking damsel, who seemed to be equally as- tonished with himself. "Looking for rooms? Well, there was a vacant room right opposite to them. The agent had left the keys in her I charge; would he like to see it? It was a nice room; it had been vacant about ten days. Didn't know the last occupant, and didn't want to know him." "Why?"  * "Why? because." "What kind of a looking man?"' "Well, he was a bad-looking man-as ugly as sin-pock- marked; had hair all over his face! Never had anything to say to him ; never wanted to; guess he couldn't speak much English. His business,? Don't believe he had any. He never was in his room inuch-why should he be?-he had hardly'any furniture in his room. Don't believe he had a bed even; guess he slept on the floor. When he went away he carried off pretty much all he had in one big box." "What kind of a box?        : "Why, a box like a sailor's chest-quite long. He had some one to help him carry it, and it had rope handles, and was painted lead-color." By this time Luther had made his way into the room, where he found a comely, well-fed dame, who seemed to be the mother, and who, .while eagerly joining in the conversation, never ceased for more than an instant working the treadles of her Wheeler and Wilson. Both mother and daughter were   400        NE, VE R. AGAI N. disposed to be particularly communicative, especially upon the subject which had begun to be of most interest to Luther. It was evident that some degree of fear had sharpened their dislike of their late neighbor, and his personal appearance was described in such vivid and picturesque terms, that Luther left the house with not a doubt upon his mind that the late occupant of the room was, the owner of the face he had seen peering into the apartments of Madame Steignitz, and that that face was the same he had a glimpse of in the street by gas-light. If so, it was clear that there was some connection between him and Mr. Planly's visitor. Mr. Planly must be found, and to find him there seemed to be no clue, except through the stout red-whiskered truck- man who had carried away his things; that might be a job of many days. Luther resolved to set himself resolutely at the work, and for two days, from early morn to dewy eve he trudged the city in all directions, examining carts and fS"iture trucks, and hunting up stout red-whiskered draymen. It was wonderful the number of stout red-whiskered dray- men he encountered. They seemed to start up in all direc- tions. He had never noticed half a dozen red-whiskered draymen before in his life, now there seemed to be nothing but red-whiskered draymen. Luther was astonished, but he had a scientific turn of mind. He did not at once jump to the conclusion that there had been a sudden cropping out of red whiskers among the fraternity, but the apparent pheno- menon was due to his own sharpened perceptions. A good illustration, he thought, of how much more we might see in the way of natural phenomena if we looked about us with our mental eyes open.   CHAPTER XXI. Light Literature-The Utility of Novels-Crossing the Ferry-An ImMt grant Steamer-Bay of New York. AT the end of the third day Luther retired to his lodg- ings, weary of .foot and quite discouraged in mind. He did not wish to talk to Mr. Whoppers. He had nothing to tell him, not a word to say except one, and that was " fail- ure;" so, as hehad taken a late luncheon down town, and had no need of dinner, he mounted at once to his own room. But he was not long allowed to remain in solitude-a slight knock at his door, and in entered the irrepressible edi- tor of the Universe. "Ah, youngster! sitting all alone, chewing the cuc of sweet and bitter fancy. I saw you come in while I wa at the dinner-table; you looked forlorn, fagged out-come, tell us all about it." "I have literally nothing to tell," replied Luther. "Oh yes you, have," returned Mr. Whoppers. "Every- body has something to tell. It does 'em good, as the poet says, to 'Slop over the wearied mind's sad thoughts Into the responsive bosom of a friend.' Come, tell me all alout your ill-luck. I ask it for your sake, not mine. For what says Pythagoras? ' Cor ne edite-eat not the heart,' which, according t? Lord Bacon, means that unless we talk of our troubles to a friend we are cannibals of our own hearts. Now, I know you havn't any heart to nib- ble at, but you may as well tell me what you have been doing to-day." ( I have been walking and riding fifty miles ; asking about 26                   '* '  of  .

"Well, now, you have done capitally. I hardly thought it was in you. No detective could do more or better." "But it don't amount to anything." "You are wrong-it don't seem to amount to anything, but you'll see in the end. Just stick to it-I'll bet on you. I don't want any better evidence than this note-book; three hundred red-whiskered cartmen found out and interviewed in three days, to say nothing of general miscellaneous work among whiskers black, brown, gray, and dyed. Good! very good!" continued Mr. Whoppers, raising his eye over the book,-" faithful, honest work-you see I am such a lazy man, such a procrastinating shirk myself, that there is nothing in this world I so much admire as good honest work. I am sure you ought not to be discouraged. Don't you see you are rapidly eliminating the great city of New York? Keep on eliminating, and you may be sure that you will come sooner or later upon the unknown desideratum-the veritable X of a cartman will turn up somewhere in the solution. "I see you are tired out," added Mr. Whoppers after a pause. "You need a little stimulus. No, I don't mean wine- bitters, or a gin cocktail, but a little mental stimulus, and I happen to have a small dose for you. I saw somebody to-day. Yes-just for a moment. She said she hoped you would per- severe and find out something about the old woman. No di- rect message pon my word. Her father was present, and I'll tell you what I think. I think the old man is going to jump his rails. I do. He looks bad, and somehow his vanity and conceit seem to be fizzling out of him. He's an altered man, and if he was not so rich, and so confoundedly respectable, I should say he had a big lump of something on his mind. Helen seems to feel that there is danger, and she looks troub- led, but the rest of the family are quite jolly. Count Isenthal seems to be there pretty much all his time. I kind of conceit that the little god has got his arrow in, clean through the fel-   1NE VER A GAN.         403 -low's pericardium. Oh, you are willing to talk now are you? Well, I've nothing more to say, and no more time to say it in. I must finish at least a dozen book-notices to-night, and get 'em in early to-morrow, as the foreman wants to lock up the form by eleven o'clock. You're tired; now go to bed soon. Don't sit up mopy and miserable, and don't let any light lit- erature weigh upon your brain. Light literature indeed! Heavy literature it should be called. I see you have got Miss Rousentales' forty-ninth; I am going to write a puff of it : a charming book-intensely interesting; original plot, devised and developed with the well-known constructive skill of the accomplished authoress; style pure and powerful, and such a tremendous knowledge of the depths of human feeling and passion, and of all the actions, and reactions and interactions of the profoundest social influences. A book that ought to be in the hands of every man, woman and child in the coun- try. That's the style, or rather that was the style, but I am going to give it up, and I am glad to see that some of the daily we-we's are doing the same thing. If we were only honest and united we might put a dam-I don't mean the one with an n to it-that kind is put easy and often-but a regu- lar dam to this flood of leaden trash. It ought to be done in the interests of humanity. Ah, a good idea that,-I will recommend it to Bergh and his society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. If the hatters should revive the fifty- pound leaden scull-cap of the old judicial torture system, wouldn't he be down upon them, and make his power felt, eh? Well, the pressure on the brain of this kind of thing is far greater, and the torture more excruciating. It's worse than the old dropping water torture. Drop! drop! drop!-one, two, three, half-a-dozen novels a day. It's,ter- rible." "Look here, now, Whoppers," interrupted Luther; "you're a great fellow to talk in that way. It isn't more than ten days ago that you were lecturing Mr. Boggs and myself upon the vast utility of novels. Didn't you say that we cannot over-estimate the utility of novels; that they are useful for in- A . . & A, . *.   404         NE 'VER AGA Ir.  struction as well as amusement; that they stir up the stolid intellects of the masses, lighten the tedium of life, lift thou sands of people above the dull realities that surround themn, and give them almost the only ideas they have of beatty and culture, and ideal sweetness and gentleness? Didn't you say all that? Consistency is a jewel." "r I know it is, my dear boy, but I'm not a city official; I am an editor, and I can't afford to wear jewels. Well, well, it only shows that there is more than one side to any ques- tion, and, like the intemperate teetotaller, we are all of us apt to confound uses with abuses. It takes a flood of trash, I suppose, to secure us a few good novels, just as it took five hundred or a thousand daubers, of whom we have no record, to make a Raphael or a Domenichino; so we must try to direct and restrict the flood, not arrest it." 'Dam it with an n," said Luther. "Exactly! Anldo you know, Luther, I seriously think of writing a novel ntyself. "Going to pitch yourself into the flood, eh?" "I suppose so; one can't judge of these kind of things for one's self beforehand. But what of that? I have never see nla lot of children in all my watering-place experience that have ever excited in my mind, towards their parents, the slightest emotion of envy. Well, what right have I to suppose that my children would be one bit handsomer, or more engaging, or better trained? and yet is that :consideration going to prevent me from trying the thing on, and some day launching out into all the glories of paternity? So with my novel. I am going to write it for the fun of the thing--Pozur eamn-ser, as we say, now that we have got to talk French so beautifully, and I shall publish it." "Pouzr amuser laablicue," said Luther. "I hope so; and elevate and instruct, and all that kind of thing; but mainly because I am naturally a very lazy man, and can't afford to throw so much labor away. Asto its re- ception, no author can predict anything about that; so much depends upon style, and incident, and treatment, and, above   NVE ER A GAIAN.        405 all, upon the characters, and in that particular you are more interested than I am." "Ho\, so?" demanded Luther. "Why, I am going to put in you and your old woman." "1Oh, get out with you!" impatiently exclaimed Luther. "A nice parting salutation,. sir," replied Mr. Whoppers, rising and opening the door; "very nice, indeed. If my memory fails me not, you have three times in the couse of your life told me to go to the devil, but you have never yet, until this moment, told me to get out. A nice exclamation, sir. I will put it in my novel, sir; we will see how you will like it then-we will see how the public will like it, sir. May you live to repent, sir," continued Mr. Whoppers, hastily closing -the door in time to intercept one of Luther's slippers that was flying through the air. "May you live to repent, sir, is the only prayer of yours, affectionately, J. T. W." The next moment Mr. Whoppers put his head again into the room. "I'll tell you whlat, Luther, an idea has just oc- curred to me that may save you much labor and time, and that is to inquire at all the ferries. It will not take long to do so, and you will, perhaps, find some one connected with the boats who will recollect such a striking-looking man, with a load of queer-looking traps, if, as I am inclined to believe, he has left the city and crossed either of the rivers. Good-night, my dear boy; ' May slumbers light, Hold thee all night, Till morning bright.' -as Syllycus Italicus, or some other cuss, says.' It was a happy suggestion that Mr. Whoppers made, as Luther found upon -his application at Canal Street ferry. At first the gate-keeper rather gruffly replied that it was absurd to suppose that he could remember any person, or any thing, that had come and gone two or three weeks ago ; besides that he might not have been on duty.  But as he talked, youth, good looks, and good manners exerted their usual influence. His mien softened, and his tone became more subdued, and    406        NE VE R A C.4 IN. the end of five Iinutes found him listening with signs of marked interest to so Inuch of the story as Luther judged it proper to tell. "Let me see I " he exclaimed. "About two weeks, ago, you say, and about eight o'clock in the morning. There wouldn't be a great many people crossing over from this side- at that hour. You say he was a tall man, with a wide-brimmed hat, and long, straggling white hair, and a cart loaded with an old forge and a lathe, and tool-chests, and an old-fashioned brass- nailed trunk, and bedding, and iron bedstead?" As the gate-keeper slowly enumerated the list, Luther re- plied with an emphatic nod of the head. "Well, now, do you know if it wasn't for the cart I almost think I do recollect something of the kind. Are you sure it was a cart?" "By no means," replied Luther. "It may have been a two-horse dray; in fact, now I think of the load of things there was to carry, 'and that the old cobbler in the basement seems to have an idea of two horses, the more inclined I am to think that it must have been a double team." "The old fellow's hair came clear down on to his shoul- ders; and did he wear an old plaid cloak, with one of those old-fashioned brass chains and hook to fasten at the neck? "Well,- then," continued the gate-keeper, after a pause, "I think I have got your man." "Do you think so?" eagerly demanded Luther, his voice trembling with his excitement. "Yes ;" and the gate-keeper deliberately nodded his head three or four times. "Yes, sir; and your drayman to match -red whiskers and all. I got into a boggle with him about making change.  He's from the other side. I don't know him myself, but I'll tell you. Jim Waters, one of the hands on the boat that is just- coming in, knows him, for I saw them shake hands, and heard him ask how his folks were. That's Jim there, just throwing off the guard-chain. I'll introduce youl." "Hollo, Jimn! here's a friend of mine going over wants   NEf A'GA-/4 A .407 to ask you a few questions. -'Twon't hurt you to answer." and the gate-keeper turned to his duties, as the boat, having dis- charged its contents, was now ready to receive the long line of carts and carriages of all kinds waiting an entrance. Tinkle sounds the pilot's bell-plash go the wheels-and the boat shoots out into one of the most magnificent and ill- teresting panoralmas in the world. As she recedes from her berth all the littleness of brick and mortar, all the meanness of decaying wooden docks, all the squalor of the markets, and filth and stench of the streets, slip away into the distance, as slips away the crime, the sin, the misery, the rudeness, the ignorance of the past, into the obscuring distance of history, lea'ving nothing for our .observation but the wavy anal mellow outlines of the classical and chivalric institutions, the more brilliant tints of social and political groupings, or the loftier sunlit towers and spires of buried genius. In this way the city glorifies -itself as it recedes, and the delighted passenger at the stern of the ferry-boat glances backward and exclaims, "How beautiful! how grand!" Really, New York, if one only gets far enough from it for a proper view, is the most lovely city in the world. Sighing a sigh of melancholy pleas ure, he walks to the bow to take in more fully the glorious natural features of a scene that needs no mellowing, or rather obscuring circumstance, to enhance its beauty. The broad, placid bay shimmering in the morning sun, and tickled here and there into rippling smiles by the playful breeze; the grand reach of water stretching through the Narrows into the lower bay, and thence onward throughout and around the world; the noble river on, the other side, bearing on its flood of waters more wealth in loaded barge and boat than ever poured into Venice or Lisbon, when those two cities were in turn sole ','marts of Inde;" the distant out-posts of the ranged Palisades on the one hand; the hills of Weehawken and Hoboken in front; and the rounded heights of Staten Isl- and on the left-all make up a picture of unmatched magnifi- cence, especially to an American who has cultivated the habit, as all good Americans do, of modifying his perceptions of   408         NEVER A GA IN. what is by glimpses of what may be. To him appear visions of the magnificent stone docks, the beautiful elevated 'belt railroads, the magnificent bridges, with arches spanning a million of masts and steam-funnels, and springing from but tresses, or swinging from towers that pierce the clouds. If anything, then, is really wanting to the viewthlat one gets from a Hoboken ferry-boat in mid-passage, it is more than made up by this aura, or ether of suggyested probabili- ties, that bathes the whole scene in its peculiar and heavenly light. This alone more than makes up for the superior height and grander form of the green slopes that gird the magnifif cent bay of Rio, or for the wider sweep and darker blue of the beautiful water sentried by stately Capri, and across which raging Vesuvius, belching smoke and flames, and lashing his flanks with rocks, forever threatens the Syren city. It would be unreasonable, then, it would be wrong, to ex- pect that-a foreigner should quite come up in his estimate of New York bay and harbor to the conceptions of an enthusi- astic native, especially one whose imagination h!as never bSen blunted by contact with the hackneyed glories of the old world. There was a large steamer just dropping anchor. The ferry-boat passed so close to her that the faces of the emi- grants who crowded- her forward deck were distinctly visible. What more impressive object? what more vivifying adjunct of natural scenery? what more suggestive subject of specula- tion? that is, of speculation mental. The other kind of spec- ulation, the speculation of runners and touters, and sharks and swindlers .of every degree, has, thanks to the Board of Emigration Commissioners, been pretty nigh destroyed. But for mental speculation nothing can equal her. Look at her as she swings to her moorings, with a thousand anxious faces gazing over her bulwarks and peering down into the steam- barges drawn up to her sides, and say if that great floating dice-box, ready to cast its cubes of humanity out upon the tables of the West, is not the most interesting and suggestive thing in the harbor. ---   rE VER A GAIN.         409 She has had a happy passage, perhaps; she has brought her charge kindly to port; she was not " built in the eclipse or rigged with curses," but who can tell how many curses dark, how many sighs and groans, went to make up that cargo-a cargo of, perhaps, equally mingled hopes and fears, but of also very far from equally mingled joys and sorrows; a freight of human passions and affections and memories ; a load of God-made flesh and blood squeezed out from home and fatherland by institutions heavy as hoary; or, as Mr. Whoppers would say, an ark full of wild animals escaping from the heavy reigns of the Old World to the nilder showers and more genial clime of Democracy. Luther stood entranced. The hug ship and its freight of life dropped into his consciousness with an effect similar to that of a piece of stick or strinog into some saturated saline solution. A whole host of fancies and historic menmories in- stantly-coalesced and crystallized around her; and into his imagination sailed the emigrant barks and galleys of all time past. Here was the Mayflower, with her load of sturdy Prot- estant bigots, bearing with them the seeds of a liberty they little dreamed of. There were the fleets of Spain, loaded with hosts of Catholic fanatics eager, with sword and rack to destroy a more promising civilization, and a religion hardly less cruel and bloody than their own. There were the staunch barks of the Northmen following in the wake of their fierce Vikings, and landing their cargo of women and children upon the banks of the Humber and the shores of Normandy. There were the crowded boats of the Saxon, as, bearing in his veins the blood of empire, he swarmed to the New World of Hengest and Horsa. There were the countless emigrant galleys of Greece tracking the victorious trireme to the shores of Sicily and the mouths of the Rhone, or up the coast of Ionia and through the yawning jaws of the Symplegades. There was the tall ship of unfortunate Dido, and, following in its wake, the barks of pious AEneas and his friends. There were the boats of Cadmus loaded with the weight of an Alphabet-the coracles of migratory hordes in the- broqle    "O        NEVER AGA IN. age; the supporting rafts, bladders, and blown-up skins of the stone age; and so on, away back unto the time when a tribe of the hairy, pointed-eared arboreal quadrumane, from whom we are descended, first straddled a lot of logs, and, favored by wind and tide, crossed a reach of water to a land of bigger nuts and larger roots, with the small game more tame and plentiful: or, still further back, and Luther could not but smile at the funny sight, as, with his mind's eye, he caught a view of a herd of our ancestors, when in the marsupial state, on their migrations, and while crossing a river in precisely the way still practised by our squirrels of the present day--each human potentiality seated upon a large strip of bark, with his broad tail curled up over his back to catch the favoring breeze. Luther smiled, and any one would Slave smiled to have seen the little ones peeping, with anxious curiosity, from their snug maternal pouches, as the whole fleet swept on to a new world, bearing in its perilous course-that is, if these may be supposed to be the ancestors of that particular tribe of arboreans who were the ancestors of our progenitors the Aryans--the destinies of civilized and Christianized human- ity. Ah! who can think without a shudder of the possibili- ties had a sudden storm dashed those frail barks to pieces, or had gigantic saurians from below, or pterodactyls from above, pouched that exposed herd of migratory marsupials in their ruthless maws? The whole world would have been given over to the Semitic, the Ethiopian, and the heathen Chinee. True religion would have been nowhere. The avid and fertile field for the cultivation of all that is truly pious, and good, and true, afforded by the Aryan mind would have been wholly wanting. Charles Martel would never have fought the battle of Tours, and all discussion as to what might have been if he had not then- and there slain three hundred thousand Moslems would have been not only useless, but impossible. It may seem improbable, especially to the slow-minded reader, that Luther could have compassed such a far-reaching train of thought in the three minutes that the ferry-boat occu- pied in passing the steamer, but, as has been before said, he   AE  lER. A GA Ar.      4 I was a youth of a very active imagination, and there is no say- ing thathe might not have run back to the Ascidian grand- father of everything human, just as the old fellow had made up his mind to. tuck up his tunic, tear himself from his ances- tral rock, and float away to some spot more favorable for de- velopmnent-some nook where higher floods and lower ebbs would enable his family to go under deeper, and come out higher and dryer, and otherwise better train themselves for their great destinies--we say Luther's imagination might have run back to the extreme links of the chain connecting a Bre- men immigrant steamer with the lower eocene, had his musings not been cut short by the voice of Jim Waters. "You want to speak to me about something? Well, sir, I'm agreeable. What is it?" Luther stated his case, to which Jim responded with a mem- ory perfectly clear and lively. "Recollected the drayman of course. He was an old friend of his. Talked with him when he first crossed in the morning, and talked with him upon going back with his load. In fact he knew Mr. Planly by sight; had seen him on the boat several times. Couldn't tell exactly -whereabouts in Hoboken the drayman lived; but Lord! that was easy enough to find out; just inquire at Tim Casey's, where he always hangs out o'nights; guessed he'd got a slate at Casey's; but they'll know where he lives at any rate. His name is Downey-William Downey-and just as likely as not he is at this moment to be found right round the corner, at the stand in first street from the dock." This last suggestion proved to be correct, and relieved L,uther from the necessity of calling at Tom Casey's. The only drayman in sight was a stout, red-whiskered man, and in person corresponded so closely to the idea of the man he was in search of, that Luther had hardly a/doubt. "Your name is Downey, is it not?"  he demanded, politely touching his hat. "That's my name, sir. Anything I can do for you?" "I want to find the address of Mr. Planly. You brought a load of things for him about three weeks ago. I have lost   At IaVLs VJ I tI A lAl/. his address. I am a friend of his, and I want very much to find him." "You do? Well, do you know I rather think that Mr Planly don't care about his friends finding him. Don't know anything about it, but that's my opinion." "He'll be willing to see me, I'm sure," replied Luther. "You're sure of that? You haven't come to bother the old fellow about any money troubles, have you? Haven't any little papers, and that kind of thing about ye, eh? Well, you don't look like it. I guess you're right. You'll find him, I guess, in a back building in  Street, between Don't know the number, but you go in by an alleyway in the middle of the block." Luther waited not for further conversation, but eagerly started off up the street.  "Don't know," muttered red-whiskered Bill Downey, "if I have done exactly the fair thing by the old fellow in setting that young one on him.  However, it's none of my busi- ness."   CHAPTER XXII. How to begin a Chapter-Inventions of all kinds-The noiseless Gun- Glimpses of Madame Steignitz's Fate-A Clue to the Bandits. ? T seems with almost all modern writers a matter de rigoeur ' to commence a new chapter as often as possible with some profound reflection; some sententious and wisdom-laden saying; or, at least, an illustrative anecdote, or a witty re- mark. The profound reflection is, perhaps, most generally in vogue. It is the easiest to come at. Have you not a vol- ume of Proverbial Philosophy at your elbow? The profound reflection can be drawn out to any length. The old illustration of the divisibility of matter-the coat- ing of gold upon a silver wire-hardly conveys an idea of the thinness and tenuity, the excessive exility, the profound reflection is capable of. It is this quality which enables it best to serve the purpose of art in introducing it. The reader may skip, if he or she pleases, and as he and she most gen- erally do-especially she,-but the profound reflection at the head of a chapter produces its effect. It emphasizes the break and rests the mind by marking the solution of aweary- ing continuity. Like rocks in the bed of a shallow stream, it breaks the flow, and enables you to perceive how deep the water is, and which way it runs. Like a dam, it checks the current of narrative until you have accumulated a head that, upon suddenly opening your sluice-gates, will carry your rickety raft of story clear over the flats and shoals of the following chapter; or, to use a figure better suited to the meridians of Maine or Michigan than to those of New York or London, the profound reflection is a kind of boom that    "4        NE VER A GAIN. holds the saw-logs of incident and character from slipping over the danm too fast, and before they have been properly slit up into beams, boards, and laths, suited to the construct- ive capacity of the general reader's mind. The profound reflection, as we have said, can be skipped. It generally is skipped. It is, perhaps, universally skipped; and an instance that recently came under observation -shows with what cool, calculating precaution, with what deliberate malice prepense, the thing can be done. A young girl of fifteen is seated in one corner of the spa- cious and elegant drawing-room of Cozzens' Wes ihotel, poring over the last volume of a fashionable English novehlst. A pencil in her hand, frequently applied to the page, attracts attention, and to her enters a gentleman-loqzuitr. "You must have an interesting book there, Miss Ra you seem to be so absorbed in it; may I ask the title?  "It is 'Hiding his Light; or, Now You See It and No You Don't See It.' I don't like it much. It's awful dull work for me. I'm not reading it for myself." "Not reading it for yourself!" "No; mother and sister want to read it, and they make me read it first and mark all the passages they are to leave out-all the reflections and observations, and that' kind of stuff, you know.  Mother says she'll give me One of those Japanese fans-they only cost thirty cents at FcIntain's--and sister promises to give me half a dollar. I am sure it's worth more than that to read every word and mark all the stuff, and I know I shan't get the money-sister never does pay her debts." Could the author himself have turned over the pencilled pages he would have been struck with admiration at the an- erring tact with which the young girl had detupperized his latest and best. Yes, the human mind is lamentably given to skipping. It is perhaps, however, lucky that it is so. Lucky, in this universal deluge of novels, that the general reader always skips-that he loves to skip.  But to skip it is necessary to have some-   NE VER A GAIN.         415 hing skipable. It won't do for an author to leave out all he plums from his pudding, simply because, not being able o put in the genuine Malaga No. I box-the real Saturdnay Revieaw article-and having nothing but the, common " keg" iandy, his readers will pick them all out and throw them dis- lainfully away. The veriest skimmer who begins a novel at :he end and reads it by snatches here and there backward, wouldn't be satisfied without a certain amount of padding and profundity. And now, having dammed our narrative long enough for all the necessities of profane art, we will turn to Luther, who has just wriggled himself up the narrow alley, and in obedience to a sharp, querulous "Come in," is pulling at the cord that lifts the heavy wooden latch of the inventor's door. Mr. Planly was seated- at a strong deal table, furnished With a vice, and covered with tools. In his hand he held a glass disk of a few inches in diameter, whichlhe was atten- tively examining. This disk was plainly the flint-glass sec- tion of the object-glass of a telescope. There was a deep cut across the face of it, almost dividing it into halves. A little nore work and the division would be complete. The old man was so wholly absorbed in his work that he did not, for an instant, recognize his visitor. But as he turned his head more fully towards the door, Luther noticed that he started, andi'that a frightened expression came over his face, which, however, gradually passed as the young man came briskly forward and shook him warmly by the hand. ' You see I have found you out," said Luther. ' I hope I am welcome. I know you don't want to be interrupted by visitors, but I thought that you would not object to see me. I am so anxious to know how all the inventions come on I couldn't wait any longer." "You came, then, of your own motion-that is, no one sent you?" demanded Mr. Planly. "I mean," he continued, seeing Luther's puzzled lookl-"I mean that you do not come at the instigation of the old woman." "How so?" asked Luther. "I don't exactly understand."   "6        NEVER X GAIN. "Well, I thought she might have got you to hunt me out, but it was ridiculous to suppose so. I beg your pardon. You are not her agent, it is true, but you visited her so often that at the first sight of you I could not but connect you with her. I suppose you know I had a little difficulty about my room. She insisted upon it that I had hired it by the month, whereas I distinctly hired it by the week. I paid her for the week in which I had made up my mind to leave, but she in. sisted upon my paying for the remaining fortnight; so, to. avoid having any squabble, I took advantage of her absence that morning she went to Staten Island and just quietly packed up and cleared out." "You need not have taken that precaution," replied Lu- 'ther. "She told me herself in the evening that she believed you were right, and that you were the only really honest ten- ant she had in the house. I am sure she would not have given you any trouble." "Well, it was not precisely fear of the old woman that made me steal away so quietly," returned Mr. Planly; "but to tell the truth, there were some other folks that I wanted to get rid of. They bored me a good deal, and took up too much of my time, and as I wanted a larger room and a better place to work, and a cheaper rent, I thought I would slip away for a while over here." "Why, I didn't know you had many visitors. I have never seen but two in your room-that Italian fellow and myself- which of us is the bore you ran away from?" demanded Luther, laughingly. Mr. Planly glanced suspiciously for an instant at the young man. "Oh, I don't mean to say," he replied, that I really ran away from any one; but I have taken up an old idea of mine, and I could not have had space enough to work it out in an attic. You see here I am on the ground foor; and here I have an old glass-blower's furnace-still good enough for my purposes. I am going to try some experiments in making glass for optical purposes. Just look through that."   NEVER AGAIN.          417 Mr. Planly handed Luther a disk of ground glass about six inches in diameter and an inch thick, which, at two points opposite to each other, upon the edge or periphery of the disk, had polished spaces of about an inch in diameter. Luther placed one of these to his eye and looked through the six inches of solid glass. "Beautiful!" he exclaimed. "How wonderfully trans- parent. I can see through it as plainly as through the thin- nest sheet of window-glass. That disk must be perfect." "You think so? Well, I can tell you that it is probably very far from perfect. It is quite likely utterly unfit for opti- cal. purposes. You can't tell until it has been ground into a lens, and tried, and then, perhaps, you will find that you have your labor for your pains. There may be nothing that you can see with the naked eye, but the delicate waves of light from a star or planet will search out the imperfections. Your lens may be made with the greatest accuracy, the curves cal- culated with matheiatical precision, and the surfaces polished with the utmost nicety, but your glass is far from pure; and being composed of materials of different specific gravities, will have in different portions different degrees of density, and, in consequence, different degrees of refractive power. It is this last which is the great trouble. Now, my improvements contemplate not only making glass free from air-bubbles- free from all the load of impurities, the dust and dirt that the purest air contains-but also free from the imperfections that arise from the different gravities of the materials employed in making glass." A long explanation of the principle of the refracting tele- scope followed, to which Luther listened not only patiently but with interest, but which it would, perhaps, take too much of our space and the reader's time to give here. "I am not a young man," continued Mr. Planly, " but I may live to see the time when some Crassus or Crcesus will find a fitting use for one of the vast, overgrown, and appall- ing fortunes which the rising tides of population, of industry, and luxury, have thrown into the laps of our rich men, in sup- '27   "-8        NE VER A GA IN. plying the imperative demands of science. There must come some one soon who, tired of a wearing heaping up of riches-- of a sordid saving on the one hand, or a vulgar ostentation of wealth on the other, and indisposed to waste his money upon the questionable schemes of a reckless and demoralizing philanthropy, or a mercenary and perfunctory piety--will set himself and his fortune to the task of opening up in various directions, and paving with dollars, the rugged paths of ex- perimental research. "Then," continued Mr. Planly, waving his hands in an oratorical manner, " we shall, perhaps, see a refracting tele- scope of five or six feet aperture, and one hundred and fifty feet focal length, or, in fact, one of twice that size ; an instru- ment that will extend the boundaries of knowledge to the far- thest realms of creation; that will make us minutely acquain- ted with the structure and conditions of our own -little solar system; that will reveal the countless planetary systems that revolve round each star as a centre ; that will take us into full vision of the remotest nebulae, and bring us face to face with every phase in the manufactory of worlds. But I am making a speech. I beg pardon." "Oh, no excuses!" exclaimed Luther. "The subject is a good one. I aln only sorry you have so small an audience. I wish old Winergelt could hear you. He might take it into his head to show us the limitations of space, and reconcile the finite and the infinite. But you must first show him how such a telescope could be made." "Well, that I am going to do," replied Mr. Planly. "I have got here a lot of glass. I am going to ascertain the ex- act densities and specific gravities of different portions; that is to start with; and then I am going to make a disk-shaped vessel, or pot, to melt my glass in ; and this vessel I shall hang on trunnions, and keep in constant revolution while the glass is in a liquid state." "Have you ever tried it?" demanded Luther. "Yes, in a small way, and with every indication of suc- cess. But it is too expensive for a poor man to attempt on a   NE VER AGAIN.         419 large scale. Oh! if old Winergelt would devote a hundred thousand dollars to making a pot of glass! We could find plenty of men to work it into form and mount it afterward, even if it weighed a ton." "But would not such a mass be liable to a change' of form in different positions, from the effect of gravity?" asked Lu- ther. "Undoubtedly; and to a reflector your objection would be fatal. But a huge refracting lens would not suffer so -much, and I am satisfied that it could be corrected for gravity; and then if its use was limited in space, as it would necessarily have to be in time, from the disturbances of the earth's at- tmosphere, I don't think the change of shape from weight would prevent it from doing wonderful work. To get a disk of perfectly pure homogenous glass of equal density through- out is the great difficulty. "Do you see this?" continued Mr. Planly, showing Lu- ther a complicated-looking apparatus. "Well, this is a model of an arrangement by which, with water passing through these tubes, covered with fire-clay, I could hang my pot of glass on gimbals and keep it revolving in every direction; but-" and Mr. Planly shook his head sadly-" that would cost a great deal of-money. I should have to rob your old woman to do that." The perfectly easy and natural voice in which -Mr. Planly made the last observation instantly removed certain dim sus- picions that had haunted Luther's mind. He felt sure that the old inventor knew of nothing that had happened at the house in Wooster Street since hs departure. "Ah! you are too late for that," he replied. "Some one has been before you in that business." "What do you mean?" demanded Mr. Planly, with a frightened look. "Well, I don't know that they have robbed her; but they have stolen her-carried her off-perhaps something worse." "What! Madame Steignitz carried off?;" "'That's my belief--she's gone-has been missing for ten   420        iEVE R AGAIN. days. The police seem to think-that is, if they take the trouble to think at all about it-that she has gone off of her- self on some trip, and will return of her own pleasure; but I know better." Luther now related to Mr. Planly all the circumstances of the case, and dwelt particularly upon the reasons, physical and moral, which convinced him that the old woman did not leave the room by the door, or of her own will, and that she would not have left her home for so long a time without letting him know her intentions during the evening previous, that he had passed with her. Mr. Planly listened, hardly asking a question, but with marks of interest increasing to the end. As Luther concluded he turned away, lifted the cover of a, glue-pot simmering over a lamp, and seemed for a moment or two to be deeply occu- pied in examining the consistence of the viscous fluid. "I knew it," he muttered to himself in tones so low that Luther could catch only here and there a word. "I was certain of it. But, what could I have done? Warned the old woman? Warned her of what? Bah! she would have laughed in my face;- but I might have- known it! a reckless, desperate, daring rascal, if ever there was one! "Do you suspect any one?-" he demanded, suddenly raising his head and looking Luther full in the face. 'cI do," replied Luther, nodding his head emphatically, and adding, after a pause,-"-' I believe you do, too, Mr. Planly." "And that some one is-?" "Your former frequent visitor," continued Luther,-" the small, dark-complexioned foreigner, for whom you were doing some kind of work--making some kind of machine which you would never let me see. I overheard a few words of his conversation two or three times. I saw him one night join a nlan waiting for him in the street just after a visit to you, which man I am satisfied is the owner of the eyes I saw peering into the window of Madame Steignitz' room.  So, putting all things together, I am satisfied- that he is the party who. has   NE VE R A GAIN.        421  caused the disappearance of the old lady; with what object I can't exactly make out; she never carried any valuables on her person, and kept no money in her room." "Well, that is a point upon which, perhaps, I can enlighten you," deliberately replied Mr. Planly. "The old woman couldn't be robbed-she had nothing on, or about her, to steal,-she has been carried off to extort money from her,- the crazy scheme of some of her desperate countrymen. They'll stop at nothing." "You don't think that she has been murdered?" demanded Luther. "Not yet," replied Mr. Planly. "You see there would be no use of killing her, until they had -compelled her to sign a check, or an order for any unregistered bonds or securities she may have. That they wouldn't kill her afterwards, I am not so sure. But the old woman is game, she won't give in until the last moment. You have been to the bank to inquire if anything has been heard of her?" Luther replied in the-affirmative. "Well, then, they haven't got anything out of her yet. She's still living, but I shouldn't wonder if they were employ ing torture." "Torture!" exclaimed Luther, and the blood for an instant forsook his cheeks, and his heart, oppressed with its burden, thumped like a lump of lead against his ribs. "Why not? What more natural? You have plenty of imagination--suppose we put ourselves for a moment in the position of the two men we suspect. Ruined, desperate, and ruthless, we have an obstinate old woman in our power, and we have resolved to make her disgorge the one thing needful to our lives, or to the success of schemes that we value more than life itself. She won't yield! Don't you think that the idea of some cheap and easy substitute for the old-fashioned rack and thumb-screw would occur to such ingenious fellows as we are?" "Could such a thing be!" exclaimed Luther. "Pooh! it must be impossible in this age and country."   "Not at all; there is no form of crime of the olden day that cannot be paralleled in the present age; that could not, in fact, be repeated if the occasion called for it. Certain crimes are now really impossible, simply because of a change of fashion, not because of any improvement of the moral sense. The credit and banking systems have altered things, and valuables are not so easily conveyed as they used to be; but don't you suppose that, if a reasonable sum could be made by it, there are plenty of men in this city who would undertake to seduce some rich Jew into a quiet apartment, and subject him to the thumb-screws, with a clever dentist standing by, ready to pull out every tooth in his head?" "You have no objections, I suppose, to tell me what you know about this man whom you admit we both suspect?" inquired Luther. "No, none," replied Mr. Planly, thoughtfully; "but I don't want the nature of my connection-with him to go any further than yourself. And first I will tell you how I got acquainted with him.  It was at an oyster saloon on Broadway. The room was full, and no place for him but at my table. I was struck with his looks, his glossy beard and moustache, and dangling curls of black. His restless dark eyes, his firm, well- cut mouth, and a general expression of subdued fierceness overlying his whole face, took my fancy. I could not tell then, and I don't know yet, whether he is French or Italian. I have heard him speak both languages. We  were soon in full conversation, and when I had finished my stew he asked me to join him in a glass of beer. This gave us still more time to talk, and after the beer we strolled up Broadway together. At last we got a-talking about inventions and im- provements in fire-arms, in which he seemed to be very much interested. I told him about my breech-loading cannon, which I spent so much time and money upon thirty years ago, and about my plan for casting cannon all in a lump, as at present, but with the centre composed of iron having great elasticity or power of expansion, and the outside layers of iron having less, so as to compel these last to take up their full share of the strain. I don't think I ever'-told you about that, did I?"   Luther was loath to reply distinctly no, for fear of diverting Mr. Planly from the more immediate subject in hand. He merely shook his head, but that was enough. The inventor at once rushed to one corner of the room, rumaged for a few minutes in a box half-filled with scraps in all forms of wood, and iron, and brass. His search proved successful. "Look here now," he said, showing two disks of cast iron, each about three inches across, and half-an-inch thick. Each one had been bored through in the centre. "You see there two disks, or flat rings if you please to call them ; they look like a pair of quoits for children. Well, they are sections of iron cylinders, one of which was cast out of the best gun-metal, the other was cast according to my plan, with the most expansible iron in the centre and the most rigid outside. You see they are exactly alike in looks and size; with the hole in the centre exactly an inch in diameter. Now if you take the first one, and into that hole you insert a tapering steel plug, and then apply a sufficient weight to the plug, you will see how a cannon bursts. As the plug is pressed in, a little crack begins at the centre, and gradually extends outwardly as the pressure is increased. That is, the ring is torn in two, or, in other words, the inner layer of metal is strained a great deal more than the outer layer, and gives way first. The outer layer does not do its full duty, and is not put to the full stretch, before the inner layer is broken, and then, when it is too late, it has to yield, itself, in turn. Now take the other disk, and insert the plug, you will find a different state of things. The inner layer is stretched the most, but it is able to stand being stretched the most. It does not give way until the full strain is brought in an equal share upon the outside layer. You will find that it takes from twenty-five to thirty per cent. more weight or power applied to the plug to burst this, than the other, and when it does burst, it gives way. altogether. That's my plan for casting cannon. Hold on just one moment, and I will show you the model and drawings."   424        NEVER, AGA IN. "Not now, Mr. Planly," exclaimed Luther. "Some other s time I shall be delighted to go into the subject, but just now I feel as if I had not a moment to give to anything but the S business of the old woman."              1 "You're right," good humoredly replied Mr. Planly. "I quite forget myself. However, I am not worse than some others. I knew a fellow once, he had nothing in his head but a revolving steam boiler, to prevent scale, and enable high pressure, without condensers, to be used for marine engines. But Lord, you'd better insure your life before talking with him--he'd bore you to death. Well, as I was saying, Mr. Fuiyard-that is the name he gave me-expressed himself very much interested in all these things, and finally it ended by his coming round to my rooms to see the drawings of my plan for mounting a howitzer or carronade upon a spar, hinged to the stem of the ship. The gun, usually carried inboard, could be lowered at any moment five or six feet below the surface of the water, and fired by coming in contact with the side of an adversary's ship. It was intended to have all the effect of the present beak or ram, now so much in vogue, but which will be found to be utterly useless so soon as vessels are furnished, on my plan, with the power of twisting themselves around, when otherwise motionless, and by means independent of any machinery of propulsion. Well, my plan for mounting the gun, and firing it under water, was at least thirty years old. I had forgotten pretty much all about it, and could not find the drawings. So, we talked, and he was about to take his leave, when I happened to say something about a noiseless gun." "A noiseless gun!" exclaimed Luther. "Do you mean a gun that would make no report when fired?" "Just that." "Well, you have it in the air-gun." "Not at all," replied Mr. Planly. ' The air-gun is a very poor and inefficient affair. No, I mean a real gun--accurate and of long range, one that will put a bullet through a man at a thousand yards. Well, Mr. Fuiyard jumped at the idea;- -  ---.. .    NE VE R A GA Ind       425 said that if I would make such a gun he would take it over to Europe and get an immense sum for it, which he would share with me. I was in want of money, as you know, and I listened to him, and as he was really eloquent, I got more and more interested and excited." "But the man meant murder!" interrupted Luther. "I can't conceive the use for such a gun, especially as I see by your model that it must be a cumbrous apparatus, except to take a quiet long shot at some offending potentate. That man is a Red, and he meant to sell your- gun out to some secret radical or communistic society." "So I thought, but he convinced me, for a while, at least, that he was going to take it to the French Emperor, and de- mand a certain sum for its suppression. He seemed to have no doubt about it. The facility with which a good marksman could establish himself in a distant attic on the other side of the Seine, or in the Rue de Rivoli, and take a long shot at) the emperor, or the young prince, every time they appeared in public, without giving the police the slightest clue to his hiding- place, he was quite confident would strike the imagination of the great imperial humbug, and that almost any amount of money might be had for sinking the invention right out of sight." "But I should think, said Luther, "that even if you succeeded in preventing-all noise, the smoke and smell of the powder would render it impossible to use such a gun with any great certainty of secrecy." "Oh, that is all provided for. You don't suppose I would leave such an element as that out of the calculation? Perfectly pure gun-cotton, or a powder composed of chlorate of potash, would do on a pinch; but I have a composition of loaf sugar, treated in a certain way, and combined with nitroglycerine, that isperfectly without smoke or smell. Mr. Fuiyard tried some cartridges I prepared for him, and was delighted with them. "Well, to make a long story short, I set to work upon the gun. - I got absorbed in the preliminary experiments and in   426        NEVER AGE  i . Ar the mechanical details of the invention. I hardly gave a thought as to the results or the moral questions that might arise." "And you succeeded?" demanded Luther. Mr. Planly nodded his head, and pointed to a long wooden box resting upon trestles at one side of the room. "Yes, there it is ; I can't show it to you, and I can't ex- plain it to you. I never even allowed Mr. Fuiyard to know anything of the principle or details ;- I only showed him the results as the experiments went on. You see there were three different ways of attacking the subject-preventing vibrations, absorbing vibrations, or counteracting vibrations by vibrations-the same as when two interfering waves of light produce darkness. As I have said, for reasons, I have made up my mind to keep the secret for the present to myself. And I cannot tell or show you any of the details, but I will just say that I found each way successful. But in one there were so many advantages that I have finally accepted it, and there it stands." Luther stared steadily at the long slender box, but as his eyes were unable to penetrate a pine board he turned and directed them to 3ar. Planly, who, from his usual subdued and slouching attitude, had drawn himself up and was pointing his nnger with the proud and confident look of a successful inventor. "You doubt it?" demanded Mr. Planly. "Well, I can't show you the machine, but I can show you its effect, with the understanding of strict secrecy on your part." Mr. Planly paused, and Luther nodded his head. "Have the goodness to look out of the window for a mo. ment while I charge the gun." Luther had hardly time to turn to the winddw-before Mr. Planly announced that he had finished the operation. "We will now," he continued, "extemporize a target out of these inch boards," and taking ten of them he placed them one over the other against the wall, and facing one end of the tube, which was furnished with a trap-door, opening by means of a spring. I . . . I    NE VER AGA IV.         427 Mr. Planly placed himself at the other end of the box and pulled the string of the trap-door. ' Now look and listen," he exclaimed. "I am going to touch this little wire which springs the lock." Luther strained eyes and ears. He could see nothing, and he could hear nothing but a slight hiss and the thud of the bullet against the target. The bullet had gone through the ten boards and flattened itself up against the rough brick wall of the room. "What do you think of that?" demanded Mr. Planly, put- ting his fingers into the deep indenture in the brick-work. "It's murder made easy," replied Luther. "It's more than that," replied Mr. Planly, impressively squeezing Luther's arm. "It is murder made safe." "Then what the devil possessed you to invent the thing?" demanded Luther. "You've hit it exactly. I suppose it was the devil; at any rate one of his imps urged me on, and to get rid of him was the main reason why I left Wooster Street. I'll tell you how it was: I had begun to suspect the fellow for some time. I found that he was a political refugee, and a most furious red repub- lican. It occurred to me more than once that he mnight be humbugging me, and that, so far from getting any money for the suppression of the invention, and sharing it with me, he would much prefer to get money for the use of it and keep it all to himself. You may, perhaps, think that this last idea quickened my perceptions of the true moral bearings of the case. Well, perhaps it did," added Mr. Planly, reflectively. ".There -is so much human nature in man that one can't always tell how big a portion of it he has himself. At any rate I began to feel dubious about trusting the fellow any way. One day I went round with him to a kind of restaurant and drinking-shop in Prince Street for a glass of ale. It seemed to be a place of resort for foreigners only ; at-least I saw none but French and Italians. A few days afterward I happened in there again. There was in the front a noisy, chattering crowd, and among them a party of quarrelsome French watch-    428        NE VAER A GAIN. case makers, who, according to weekly custom, were drinking up the large, easily won wages of the last days of the week,' by a carouse on Champagne, lasting the first three. I wan. dered into the back room, which was comparatively quiet, and put my mug of ale upon a table placed close to a windolv closed with a wire screen, and opening on to the back piazza. The glass was up, and there was nothing but the screen be- tween me and two men seated at a table on the piazza. They were busy drinking and talking, and had no suspicion of any one being so near. I at once recognized my friend, Mr. Fui. yard, and was going to salute him through the window whenl I heard some allusion to the gun. You know I understand French tolerably, and, notwithstanding there was a good deal of patois and argot too, I could make out most of what they said. They were discussing the question as to whether it would be best to try the gun on the little one or on the old fellow first. I was not left long in doubt as to who were meant by these terms. K Iill the old fellow,' said the stranger, 'and we shall have afterward to kill the young one, and his mother too. There will be a regency, and, perhaps, a strong one, and God knows how long it may last. But kill the little one and there can be no regency, and the old one may take it hard and die off at once, and at any rate he can't last long, and then--well, we know what will happen then.' "' But I can't let the old fellow off,' returned Mr. Fuiyard, and he struck the table and rattled out a volley of oaths, half Italian and half French. 'I have watched and waited, and prayed for an opportunity to take that rascal's life, and now here comes my chance; I cannot forego it. It will be the happiest moment of my life when I draw a bead upon that stumpy, yellow-skinned, fish-eyed humbug, as he slouches along the terrace, or squints through his opera-glass from the Pavilion window.' "Of course," said Mr. Planly, "I don't pretend to give you an exact translation of what thev said, but that was about the substance. The other one still urged that it would be   NE VER A GAIN.         429 best to kill the little one first; that in reality he was the cause of his father going all wrong; that if he had not been born the father would have made a very good ruler; that having no dynasty to look after he would really have tried to educate the people of France for the inevitable republic, but that the birth of that brat had spoiled all. Mr. Fuiyard would not ad- mit this--the father was a villain from the first. He attained power by lying, and fraud, and wholesale murder; that as to both blood and brains he was an impostor; that everything about him was a vile sham ; that the rule of such a perjured humbug was emasculating France, and, as far as French in- fluence went, demoralizing the world; that the only way to break up his erntourage of pretentious and reckless rascality and mendacity was to strike at him. He was the tool by which political villainy and- religious bigotry worked the vast fund of popular ignorance to their own selfish ends. Kill him and you would break up the clique that made him and upheld him, and scatter in confusion the conglomeration of infamous influences that fed his fictitious power. "Imagine this," continued Mr. Planly, " or something very much like it, uttered in a subdued voice, but with passionate volubility, and you will get an idea of what struck my ear and enlightened my mind very much. I slipped out without b'eing seen, and at once made arrangements to get away from Wooster street the next morning, and now you have the real reason for my stealthy demdenagement, and the reason why your appearance here gave me such a start. Every time that door opens, I have been afraid that Mr. Fuiyard would enter, and that I should have a fine scene with the fiery jacobin when I had to tell him plumply that I would have nothing more to do with him." "And do you think that he is the abductor of Madame Steignitz?" asked Luther. "I do. I don't know that he is or has been the principal actor, but as the -chief concocter of the scheme, I am pretty sure that he is the man. And I'll tell you why. He is a bold, reckless, scheming fellow. He knew that Madame  43P        V v , . 'K A GCA4IN. Steignitz was enormously rich, in fact he knew it much better than I. He knew the how and the why of her riches. He knew that the old woman never kept any valuables about her or in her room. He was in want of money, in fact often in desperate straits; and often talked of the old woman's wealth; and, one day, I recollect he said he would like to put a Nwoodenl jillabeah on her. He said he'd bet she'd yield a million. I asked him what he meant by a wooden fiVllberah. He said that it was a garment consisting of two planl;s with screws between them, used by the Emperor of Morocco for collecting hs dues. Whenever a man gets to be too wealthy, the Em- peror sends for him to come to court, puts him between these two planks, and turns the screws until he consents to disgorge into the imperial treasury." "He must be the man," muttered Luther. "There can be no doubt of it." "Another item," continued Mr. Planly, after a pause, "is, that I hav"e seen him in company with a man owning just such a hideous face as you saw looking into the room." "And that man is the same man that lived in the attic of one of the houses in the block, and who vacated his room the morning after the old woman disappeared. Id'see it all now," continued Luther. "It is just as clear as day. But what is to be done? what is the next step? how shall I find the old woman, or ferret out and punish her murderers?" "I'll tell you one thing you had better try and find, and that is-her will. I  shouldn't wonder if she had left you something handsome!" "I will prove her to be dead first, before I think about that," replied Luther.         '"You think she has left a will, then?" "I don't know," replied Luther. "She told me one day that she was a very poor woman, and that she had not a rela- tion in the world, but that she was going to make her will so as to leave me an old brown candlestick with a most horrible dog's-head for a handle, and her colored plaster bust of Na- poleon, something, she said, by which I could remember her   Mr. Planly could give Luther no advice as to his future proceedings. He merely made one remark, and that was that he felt pretty sure that Mr. Fuiyard or his companion would not be found by merely visiting the drinking-shop,in Prince street. He doubted whether either would venture in there at present. The place was too public, and they would not show themselves where they knew that he-Mr. Planly--had been sometimes in the habit of going. Luckily Luther had in Mr. Whoppers a more experienced adviser. To him he communicated the secrets of his day's work, concealing nothing but the character and objects of the wonderful gun. The result of his earnest consultation with the astute Editor of the Unliverse may be summed up in a few words Luther was to look out for his man, or men, himself. He must expect to find them disguised, and most probably frequenting some of the lowest haunts for foreigners in the neighborhood of Canal street or Broome street; that he would have to assume some kind of disguise himself, and that, once on the track, he could then get some assistance from the detective force, and shadow them to their most secret lair. "' Good-night, my dear fellow," was Mr. Whoppers' parting salutation. ' It's a nasty job, but if ever there was a youngster without much experience fitted for it, I suppose you are the one. If you had less coolness and pluck, I should say give it up; but you are determined, and I must say for your comfort I am not at all sure that you are not right."   CHAPTER XXIII. A Moroccan Institution-New York Squeezing Processes--A Terribll Spectre--Mrs. Ledgeral's Medical Advice--Josepl'lls Reflections- Fond Memories--A Mother's Anxieties--A nlew Cure for Neuralgia, WJ OULD it, or would it not, be possible to introduce that happiest institution of Morocco, the wooden jillabeali, into this country? The question must have occulI red to the attentive reader of the last chapter. The pure Anglo-Saxon is ever loath-to accept anything as an improve. ment from inferior branches of the Aryan race i and for anyI thing coming from barbarians of Semitic blood no words can sufficiently express contemnpt. Now, the American of mixed blood-above all a New Yorker of the dominant Celtic race, ought to be more liberal-but is he? Can you knock it into his head that the " blatherin furiigners" can teach us any thing at all? He goes for developing old institutions rather than adopting new ones. For instance, what more striking than the extension of the jury system to meet the wants and re. quirements of our ruling classes? A system as old, as the days of Alfred is, with the happiest ingenuity, made to sub- serve a purpose newer than Tamnmany--as new as the new Court House. Pass a law to " rope in" for duty every one from twenty-one to seventy, and you have an almost inexhaustible fund of fifty-dollar fees for quietly scratching names off the jury lists; so that from being a system for determining legal justice, it has become mainly a beautiful instrument for the collection of the taxes that rich people owe their rulers for taking care of their property. So with all our other institu- tions; they are either fully developed, or in the process of de- velopment, to suit the times.    Still, it may be contended that the wooden jillabeah might be advantageously introduced. Its superiority in many par- ticulars is manifest. It would be a great saving in time. Now, when the ruling classes wish to make a rich man contrib- ute his proper quota to the support of his superiors, the pro- cesses are roundabout and wasteful. There is the slow sys- telm of legal taxation. Beautiful, it is true, ald the easy see- saw movement pleases the people. Yo)u run up the rate and diminish the valuation, or you diminish the rate and run up the valuation. Of course no sensible man cares much whether he pays five per cent. on a million, or two-and-a-half per cent. on two millions. The movement is simple, but the machinery is complicated, and the mill grinds neither fast nor fine. A better way is to repair the street before Mr. Croesus' door and charge him double, the contractors price. If the foolish fellow trusts to the law, which says that he can be assessed only for first paving, not repairing, a street, why all you have to do is to alter the grade of the street half an inch. Give the poor devil a new street, and add twenty-five per cent. to his bills for grumbling. What with the Croton Aqueduct Department and the Board of Health, and the various other boards and departments of the city administration, there are a hundred ways of touching up a recalcitrant citizen, or, in other words, making a balky Crcesus step up to his collar. All these work well, especially if you can get the Citizen's Association, or arcommittee of our most respectable citizens, to first put a little mud in his nose. The indignant reader may justly demand an apology for this metaphor, buts it will suit the ineridian of certain magnifi- cent up-town stables built with corporation money, and will be easily understood by parties who cannot only handle the reins of government, but can tool their buggies alongside of a Vanderbilt or a Bonner. As we have said, all these plans are beautiful; but, per- haps, the neatest is opening a new street-on paper; levy- ing assessments on property anywhere within five miles, and 28  434        VNE VER A GA IN. then-why then, leaving the new street for ten years on paper. If ever the time comes for doing anything at it, property all around can be reassessed to pay for working the street, and then, when it is finished, there may be a third assessment for tearing it all up again and altering the grade. Some foolish people get: into a passion when talking about these things, and may even go so far as to deny the ordinary amount of flesh and blood to a writer who refuses to treat them to a little vigorous denunciation. How absurd! How perfectly ridiculous! If the rich men, the respectable men, the pious men of Gotham are content to neglect their public duties, to fiitter their time and influence in vain schemes of impossible moral or religious reform, to waste their time in passionate abuse of an energy they dare not, or cannot, emu- late; or they content themselves with a spasmodic effort which, because it heads off for a moment a Tweed or a Sweeny, is supposed to be the regeneration of the whole com- munity--if they are willing to walk, each his own way, in the vain shadows of national politics, why should a poor devil of an author disquiet himself in vain? He can only pass on his way quietly, consoling himself at the death of all municipal honor, and honesty, and decency with the melancholy force of the words of the burial service : "Man heapeth up riches, and can not tell who shall gather them. And now, O Lord, what is my hope?  Truly, my hope is only in thee." But we are wasting time arid space, and wandering from our text, which is the wooden jillabeah. Beautiful as are the squeezing processes of Gotham} the Moroccan process is more beautiful still, and its simplicity is wonderful. Suppose that the late worthy Comptroller of New York, when he had se- cured his well-known voluntary auditing committee of wealthy and eminently respectable gobmouches, and just when they were listening with open mouths to his explanation of the curious fact in the natural history of the little joker--that sometimes you see it and sometimes you don't see it-just suppose for an instant that he had had the wooden jillabeah hanrwly, he might have slipped it on-a dozen turns of the   NrY VER AGAIN.        435 crew! and crack-a few bones only-and twenty millions fould have fallen into his lap, with which he could have an- swered the demands of our ruling class for six months at least, after sending home the compressed committee-men in the shape and condition of perfect flats, with no stomachs to put their dinner in, even if they had money enough left to buy it. A happy way this of determining the great social question what is going to be done with our enormous overgrown for- tunes. Is accumulation and concentration to be allowed to go on indefinitely? Shall we be permitted to heap up money, or, still worse, to have it heaped up for us, without the least exer- tion on our part of either labor, capital, or brains, into vast tottering piles that threaten at any moment to fall, perhaps under the reckless agony of a death-bed repentance, and overwhelm the community in one universal wave of demoraliz- ing philanthropy? Of course it's revolting--it is worse-it is communistic and revolutionary even to state the question, but-- Well, the spectre is gigantic when fully developed, and we won't uncork the bottle until we can give him more room to expand himself in. Enough to say here, that if all fortunes would dissipate themselves, like Mr. Ledgeral's, for instance, there would be no question of the kind. He, poor man, had pretty nearly approached the solution of the question for himself He was still shivering in the agonies of doubt as to whether in a few days there would be anything of his fortune left--whether, in fact, there would be even a few rags of reputation remaining, in which he might wrap himself, and wait while recuperating under the invigorating influence of the business in Burling Slip. Luckily, so far, no one had any suspicions of the real state of his affairs. Mr. Gainsby knew that he was- pressed for money, and had to draw to the utmost limit upon the spare funds of the concern; but Mr. Ledgeral had responded so readily to the call of the firm at the time of the great panic, that he could not think of his partner as being seriously em- barrassed by his outside speculations. He looked upon all   430   9      A. V ER ,GA4 Z. -V . speculations,-except, of course, legitimate speculations ill a few standard articles, coffee and sugar for instance, and occa. sionally speculative advances to secure crops or cargoes, -as not only wrong, but worse--as absolutely foolish, and it never entered his head that his partner, a man of sense and high social posion, a little flighty, it is true, and over-fond of parade and show, and who was the head of a business that yielded to his share, in the good years, seventy or eighty thousand a year, could have plunged so recklessly into the ocean of speculation, and was now all afloat with his head hardly above water, and supported only by financial bubbles and bladders, that were daily bursting and collapsing around him. He looked upon his partner's supposed doings, not with the utter abhorrence due to the regular gamester, but rather with the feelings with which the feminine entourrage of Jones or Robinson watch paterfamilias as he slyly slips a napoleon or two on the green cloth at Baden.  Naughty -man! but then there is not the least fear that pa will really gamble-onlv just a little, for the fun of the thing; not the least apprehension that when the Saratoga season is in full blast he will do more than look at the outside of our American Gully's handsome club-bouse. Mr. Gainsby, in the quiet of his secluded counting-room, little appreciated the full force of that blast of passionate longing for sudden fortune, of intense burning desire for vast wealth, mingled with an utter contempt for small gains, that is now sweeping over the land, whirling into fritters honesty, piety, decency, and self-respect. A tornado of greed! And yet, that is hardly the term for it-one cannot think of the whirling zephyr that merely raises the dust on the road as one and the same thing with the cyclone that, as Mr. Whoppers would say, levels forests and sinks navies at a single blow. The Americans, as we have said before, never did care as much for the almighty dollar as their penny-loving cousins of England, their kreutzer-saving kindred of Germany, or their centime-cherishing friends of France. But now, the miserable coin, except in conglomerated masses of millions, can hardly   be considered money of account; and no doubtsthe time will soon arrive when children just out Of the arms will indignantly chuck dollars at the heads of niggardly uncles and aunts, and refuse anything under double eagles or fifty-dollar bank-notes. Uncle Shippen knew that Mr. Ledgeral had been fooling around in " the street," because he had been called upon sev- eral times to help lift the load when Mr. Ledgeral's usually un- failing resource, the general money-market, tightened up for the time. -"I hope he will lose every cent of it," was his muttered speech as he drew his last check. "Courtlandt always was a gambler at best, and he'll go on, unless he gets his fingers burnt now, until he gets into the fiery furnade of financial affliction, heels over head." But Uncle Shippen had no idea that his debtor was already fairly within reach of the flames. And so stood matters at home. Mr. Ledgeral grew thinner, and paler, and feebler in gait, but his wife had no suspicion that anxiety of mind had anything to do with his failing hqalth. It was nothing but indigestion. He must be more careful in his eating-the poor man hardly tasted food; he must stop drinking Champagne, it was bad for the stomach, and try Catawha. Now if there was anything Mr. Ledgeral detested it was American wine of any kind, unless it were of some of the later California brands, which are really getting to be quite drinkable. He must try Dr. Swindleson's "Safronitic Vital Reformers." Mrs. Johnston's baby was so sick, and they just gave her half a lozenge, and it cured her right off. Well, if he did not want any baby-stuff, there was Dr. Billkens' "Corpse Reviving Bitters." It had cured hundreds and thousands. The wrapper on the bottle had the certificates of more than a dozen clergymen; and, besides, there was the case of Julia Jenkins-she was so thin and pale, and couldn't stay through the whole of the German. Well, she has been taking quanti- ties of those Bitters for a year past, and do you know she is getting quite plump; and such a color! Quackery? Well, perhaps you're right. No one can approve as a general thing, andfor universal use, of quack medicines. But, my dear, you will see Dr. Petkaff, won't you? He is coming to see Helen,   ,"      'v vt, v L:,F. I r./llY. She is looking so peaked, although she declares nothing is the matter with her. Now when he comes you will let him see you, won't Vyou? He is so pleasant, and so agreeable, and so scientific; and he knows all that is going on in society, and can be so entertaining; and he don't give much medicine unless you really need it. You will let him see you, my dear, just to let him find out what is the matter with you? You look wretched-you do, upon my word; you need not be afraid of Petkaff ordering you anything disagreeable. He was explaining the other day how to take pepsin--horrible. tasting stuff. You just take pains azyme, a kind of large wafer, and you dip one in water and lay it in the palm of vour hand, and then you throw the pepsin powder on it and double it over and over, and then swallow the little package down just like a small oyster. Oh, it's perfectly delightful!" Mr. Ledgeral was obstinate. He would take no quack medicines, and he would consult no doctor. He had no idea of having the shrewd Petkaff prying into his maladies, even if the doctor kept, as he most probably would, his diagnosis to himself. The only one in the house who had any idea of the true state of the case was old Joseph. He had just answered Mr. Ledgeral's summons, and had deposited on his study-table a bottle of Bourbon and a decanter of iced-water. "I don't dislike de Champagne," he muttered, as he re- turned to his pantry. "De Champagne merely indumcates dat de tight is in de money-market. But when it comes to 'most a  bottle of Bourbon in de day, 'pears to me I don't know what to tink," and Joseph pulled out his bandanna and mopped his bald head for some time in silence. He got up and reached down from a shelf a Champagne- bottle which had been carefully recorked, and placed in an inverted position behind a pile of plates. There was the third of its contents left in the bottle, and the vigor with which the cork was blown out when loosened a little, indicated that the wine was still as lively as ever. "Dat Roederer is the genoowine, dat's de fac'. It holds   on to de gas furst rate, but dat American stuff fizzle furst like de debble, and den it's as flat as a pancake. You can't no more get a fizzle out ob him de second day den you can git a sigh out ob a dead nigger. One is the genoowine, and de oder 'taint no wine at all." Joseph deliberately poured the wine into a tumbler, and after recorking and replacing the bottle, proceeded to add a few-lumlps of ice to his glass. He resumed his seat, took a sip of Champagne, and commenced brushing up, the outside at least, of his reflective faculties with his old spotted ban- danna. Suddenly there was a slight knock, and the door of the pantry opened. "Who's dat? Who's dar?" cried Joseph, starting and pushing his glass of Champagne behind a neighboring tureen. A young colored man, Joseph's assistant in his table du- ties, put his bland and smiling face into the pantry, but was met by such an objurgatory salute that he was glad to beat a hasty retreat. "What you want, eh? Nothing? Well, take it and clare out den. Go down stairs and stay dar till de bell ring, or till I call you. I'm reflectum, I is; and when I'm reflectum I don't want any niggers round; and I won't hab 'em; I tell you I won't hab 'em." "Oh my! oh my!" he soliloquized, as the intruder hastily withdrew, " it is mighty hard work to git 'long' wid dese 'mancipated darkies; dey is so sassy and perient," and Joseph sat down again to his Champagne and his reflections, the result of which latter was that Mr. Ledgeral must have something very heavy on his mind, and that that something must be a money trouble, and that it was a duty he owed to his master, and the family of which he was such an important component part, and, above all, to Miss Helen, " de chile dat he'd a gwone and brung up hisself," to get his savings-bank balance somehow into the hands of Mr. Ledgeral. Buf how to do it. "Dat's jiss 'zactly what dis ere chile don't know," solilo- quized Joseph. "'Cause you see, honey, when I looks at    "O         NE VER A GAIVN. him, and jiss a gwine to speak, he looks back at me and sits me all in a tremble. He looks at me black as a roasted nig. ger, and his eyes, oh my! his eyes shine way-down in the back ob his head like two holes in a charcoal heap, and I 'spect to hear him yell out, 'What de debble you fooling round here for, you old snow head? Clare out! ' and so I clare out; and I don't hab de courage to gib- him dis bank- book, and to speak right out and say, ' Looker heali, Misser Courtlandt Ledgeral, I don't like dis ere kind ob going on. It's a killin' you, and it's a killin' Miss Helen, and it's a kill- in' me. Der's de money, and let us go right back to one bot. tle of Champagne on Sunday, 'ceptin' dar is company.' " The old man took two or three sips in silence, and then turned over the leaves of his bank-book, dwelling with partic- ular attention upon several large items of credit, until he came to the end. "'Pears to me dat nobody could objec to dat balance. It reads fust rate ; tree thousand seben hundred and sebenty- seben dollar and sebenty-seben cents. I tell you what, honey, ye can't do it verberally, but ye can do it writingly. I'll jess enwellop dis ar book and leab it on his table annermousely. Golly! I got it," continued the old man, slapping his thigh as a brilliant idea struck him; a I got it. I'll jess do it up, and I'll get Miss Helen to write her fader's name upon it, and I won't let her know what is in it, and she won't let him know whar it come from." Joseph chuckled for some time over this ingenious plan of getting his bank balance into the hands of Mr. Ledgeral with- out him, or anybody else, knowing anything about it. The idea seemed to be so clever that he decided to sop it in a little more Champagne. In the meantime Mr. Ledgeral was walking up and down his study, taking occasionally a heavy sip of Bourbon, and ut- terly unconscious of the friendly plans brewing in the butler's pantry. Affairs had gone neither better nor worse with him since we last saw him. Perhaps, considering all things, he was a little easier in his mind. He had been stretched so long   NE VER A GAIN.         441 upon the rack of speculation that his mental muscles and ten- dons were becoming somewhat used to the strain. They say that it was often so in the olden torture times; and that when the poor wretch on the rack ceased to groan, and shriek, and began to yawn and give signis of sleepiness, they were forced to take the strain off lest his capacity for suffering should be wholly used up. Those were cases of exhausted sensibility. Perhaps the relief that comes to the tortured speculator may rather be considered cases of blunted or destroyed sensibility. Like the Indian Fakir, the first time the poor speculator lies down on his bed of spikes he writhes in torture, but after a few weeks or months in Wall Street the cuticle of conscience thickens up, and mental callosities develop themselves, and his aciculated couch becomes downy. Mr. Ledgeral was very far from the downy stage. He was still suffering, but with the help of Champagne and whiskey, he was getting a little used to it. In the great bulk of his speculations-in stocks, and cotton, and in petroleum, there was just that uncertainty as to the final result which leaves the freest rein to the imagination,-the widest field for the disport of hopes and fears. If he could go on borrowing long enough he might squeeze through without the loss of much money, and, still better, without the loss of reputation. But that business with the Count! -there was the trouble,-that was the cloud from which the bolt that would crush him lifeless to the earth might at any instant come. Sometimes he almost wished that it would come, and that he could know the worst. No doubt Damocles, if he had sat at the table long enough, would, in time, have eyed the sus- pended sword with curiosity rather than fear, and at length have wished that the devilish thing would fall. But the Count gave no sign of any hurry for business. He was too much taken up with the study of the faults, follies and shortcomings of American society in general, and with the peculiar graces and charms of Helen Ledgeral in particular. And Mr. Ledgeral had plenty of time to nurse his plan of bat- tle, pushing out his daughter upon the flanks of his enemy,   "2        NEJ VER A GAI. . capturing him and converting him from a cold, hard stranger into a considerate and submissive son-in-law. In this plan Mr. Ledgeral enjoyed the cordial co-operation of his wife. She knew nothing of his real reasons, but she fully agreed with him that it would be a very good thing. Indeed what fashionable and affectionate American mother could be insensible to the advantages of such an aristocratic match, and the consequent opening up in its innermost veins and lodes of the mine of happiness enclosed in the court circle at Berlin. Her own position at home xwas of course good enough. She stood on the very pinnacle, but she hadn't any glory around her head; and as mother-in-law to a real Count she would be entitled to that heavenly distinction. Mr. Ledgeral stopped short in his walk, seated himself at his'desk, and unlocked a secret drawer. He took out from its recesses the long golden tress which we have seen him once before examining. His eyes shone with a softened lus- tre, and the lines of his face lost some of their rigidity, as he slowly pulled it through his fingers, and-naughty man!-even once raised it to his lips. But was it naughty in him to do so? The act implied no infidelity, even in thought, to his most respectable and respec- ted partner in life. It was simply the memento of an extinct passion--it was simply the reminder of a glorious time when the glamour of youth had made him master of the world and the kingdoms thereof; and then, the mystery! Well, naughty or not, it amused his mind, it diverted attention for a moment from  his cares and troubles, and took him out, as it were, from  his own present miserable and contemptible self. Let a  jury of middle-aged respectables, who have never secretly indulged in any fond fancies of the past; who have never, even perhaps when lying side by side in the legitimate and dignified seclusion of the marriage bed, had visions pleasant,= although perhaps shocking, of that last flirtation,--that whis- pered declaration,--that tender caress,-that impassioned kiss, etc., etc.,-let such a jury, if one can be found without exhausting the panel of society, condemn him.   NEE VER GA1 CA V.       443 Mrs. Ledgeral, like a wise woman as she was, always gave a slight knock before opening the door of her husband's room, and this enabled Mr. Ledgeral to huddle back into its recep- tacle, the wicked little tress of golden hair. "My dear," she began, "I have come to tell you that I have made up my mind to take a run up to West Point,-that is, if you are well enough." "I am well enough for you to go," replied Mr. Ledgeral, rousing himself and speaking with an unusual degree of vivacity. He understood his wife thoroughly, and he knew that she would not dream of going away from the city unless she had secured the Count as one of her party. The Count in the country for a month or two, any inquiry into business matters must be deferred, at least until his return. 'The con- demned in his cell hails with joy a respite on some frivolous points of law, even if assured he will ultimately be hanged. The prospect of temporary relief from the spectre of the ruin that would overwhelm him, at the daily, hourly expected intimation from the Count' that he would like to examine his bonds and securities, and otherwise look into his own busi- ness matters himself, sent the color to Mr. Ledgeral's cheeks, and for the moment quite drove out the worn and haggard expression that had become the habit of his face. "Of course, he will go along with us," replied Mrs. Ledg- eral, "but unless you go, I don't know that I can go myself. I can't bear to go away and leave you ailing, although I know you won't let me do anything for you if I stay. You're sure you can spare me for a few days? Well then, you will send me word every day how you are; the trains run so often, and the distance is so short. '1 wouldn't think of going to New- port or Saratoga, but only to West Point, and Helen is really looking so very poorly, and I think needs change of air. The Count wants to visit the Military Academy with us. I'm sure you might leave the city for a few days. Com. now, make up your mind. I know it will do you good." Mr. Ledgeral shook his head. '"It is impossible," he said, "but I think it a very good   "4        NE VER AGAINrz.  plan for you to go, only, my dear, there is one thing: there may be a great many girls at West Point, and the Count- you know-v-  But you understand that kind of thing." "Oh! you can trust to me, my dear. The Count has had Mother Bevens with her beautiful daughters after him, and Mrs. D'Oberge has been following him up, but he don't seem to mind them. The only one I should be afraid of, is Delie Chasseur. She is so clever you know, so lively and piquant, and the Count seems to like her, but I have just ascertained, that she's going for a fortnight with Mrs. Frank down to Lopg Island, so she will be out of the way. "The only thing that troubles me," continued Mrs. Ledg- eral, after a short pause, "is the way Helen acts and looks. She won't exert herself a bit. She don't exactly avoid the Count, and she don't treat him coolly. She rather seems to like him, but she is so listless and has so little to say. She never touches the piano now, and won't sing a note. And she has got so careless about her dress, I don't know what to make of the girl. I told her I should order Madame Vo- lorem to make her six dresses, and she said, 'Very well mamma,' antD nothing more. She didn't seem to have the least curiosity about color, or material, or trimming, and when I told her that panniers were going to be cut at least a finger's length longer, she said, 'Very well, mamma.' Says I, 'Helen, there is your blue organdy sprigged with orange- blossoms; Madame Volorem purposes to trim that with petites couzilles a 1'escargot. I think it will be perfectly lovely. 'Just as you please, mamma,' said she,-'escargot or escarbot- it is all the same to me.' Just to think of it! If there is any- thing in the world she hates, I know it is a black beetle. Now, my dear, what do you think can be the matter?" Mrs. Ledgeral darted a penetrating look at her husband, who sat gloomy and glowering, in silence. The idea of Luther Lansdale was in her mind, and his name upon her tongue, when Mr. Ledgeral turned to her as if to speak. "My business is just now so pressing," he said at length, "and I see and know so little of what is going on, that  ' .   NEVE R AGAIN.         445 I am no judge of the matter. You think the Count is in earnest?" "Well, he puzzles me almost as much as Helen does-he acts so queerly. He is devoted to her, but whether he's in love with her I can't make out. HEe stares at her with, his great blue eyes, in such a way that sometimes I think it's more curiosity than admiration. He has such a puzzled expression; and he don't seem in the least jealous. The night of the tableaux at the Delorains-I wish you had gone with me, they were really beauagful-Helen would have nothing to do with them until it was proposed to have a short scene, or rather a kind of tableau chantant, from Lucia;-the Count to sing Edward's famous song. He said -he would if Helen would pose with him as Lucy. Well, no one ever saw such a Lucy before; she was so lovely, but so wan and so woe-be- gone, and really looked so heart-stricken that everybody was in raptures. But I could see that it was Edward and not the Count she was thinking of, and I could see that the Count thought so too." "And you think that there is'a real Edward in the case?" demanded Mr. Ledgeral. "I do," replied the lady emphatically. "And he is-? "'That Luther Lansdale " "I don't think you need trouble yourself about him. I thought that you had come to that conclusion some time since." "No, he will give me no trouble, except so far as he troub- les the mind of my daughter. Helen knows the utter impos- sibility of marrying any one without a fortune--a very large fortune." "We did not have a great deal to begin with," muttered Mr. Ledgeral. "True, my dear, but that was twenty-five years ago. Things are not now as they used to be. If a man was a rising. man ; if he had a good future before him; that was enough then. But now, a girl of position must marry a risen man-a man with a good present. Then, a girl might marry a poor man as   "6         NE VER AGAIN. a matter of sentiment; now, every sentiment of society is against it; and talking about a present, puts me in mind of the presents. I have always said to my girls, ' Girls, when you are married, you will have to exhibit your presents-will have to let everybody, that is everybody in society, Tom, Dick, and Harry, and their wives and daughters, come in and examine all the cards, and make their remarks. Well, you will want your presents to be as fine and as costly as anybody's, but if you marry a poor man, nobody will want to give you any pres- ents. That's human nature, you know." Mr. Ledgeral made a gesture of impatience. "I see, my dear, you are tired, and really there is no use in my talking to you in this way. I quite agree with you that this business of presents is excessively vulgar, but it is the fashion; as- Boggs says, more ton than taste : and, really, since all the thieves and rascals, and politicians, and office-holders, and such kind of people are getting to parade their wedding presents in the newspapers, I suppose we shall have to give it up; and I say so to the girls. I say, 'Girls, the time may come when you will have to get married without a single fish- knife-Julia Newcombe had fifteen-or butter-boat,- or sugar- bowl,' but the necessity of a large fortune to people of our po- sition will never, never grow less imperious. You know this, my dear, as well as I do, and Helen knows it, and I am much mistaken if the young man don't know it too. I had a talk with Mr. Whoppers about him the other day, and he quite relieved my mind. He quite satisfied me that the young man, although nothing but a clerk, has all the feelings of a real gen- tleman, and would no nlore think of marrying a fashionable girl, unless he had a great fortune to offer her, than he would do any mean and rascally thing in businsss. No, we shall have no real trouble with him. But I am sorry for. Helen. She has less ambition, and more heart, than her sister, and don't take so kindly to the yoke that high social position imposes. The fact is, aunt Shippen has permitted her to read so much poetry, and all that kild of stuff, that I am afraid she is getting quite unfitted for actual life. I have always been   E VER A GAIN.         447 opposed to it. And then her writing poetry herself-I feel I have been guilty in not setting my foot 1own at once on that point, but you and Mr. Whoppers have laughed at her so en- couragingly, and I did not know but that it minght have a good effect and quiet her imagination, and teach her what foolish- ness it all is-teach her how absurd all dreams and fancies of ideal life are, compared with the real facts and duties of her high position. But she is such a queer girl, and I don't know that I fully understand her yet; but I don't think that she would do anything really wrong-I don't think that she would go and marry a poor devil of an author, or a poet, or a doctor, or a navy-officer, just because she fancied him. No! she wouldn't do such a foolish thing as that. Still I should really like her to love the man she marries a little, at first. Of course she will do so afterwards-all girls of society do." Mr. Ledgeral fairly groaned. "Well, well, I don't want to bother you with these things. It will all come right. And now, as I was saying, I am going up to the Point for a week or 'two; don't you think you had better go along? You can't? Well, I shall tell the house- keeper and Joseph to take good care of you; and, my dear, if you should get worse, don't fail to write me word and I will come down to you at once; and, my dear, I hope you will take some care of yourself, and see Dr. Petkaff every day; and if I were you I wouldn't take so much of that Bourbon ;- it's strengthening, I know, but -it don't seem to agree with you. And it isn't half as good for neuralgia as Burgundy. You know what Ell Gelston says! He- is not a Doctor, ,I admit, but he stands very high at the Bar; and he says there is nothing like Burgundy and buckskin for neuralgia. I wish I could get you to wear a suit of chamois." "A suit of chamois!" groaned Mr. Ledgeral; "and in the dog days?" "Well, well! my dear. I don't insist upon that; but be sure you exchange Bourbon for Burgundy,' and don't fail to write regularly and let me know how you are. I wouldn't go if I didn't think you would write or telegraph at once."   "8        NEVER A GA IN. "Oh, go! go! and "-Mr. Ledgeral almost uttered some thing not only profane, but quite impolite. He refrainer however, and merely added-" go and enjoy yourself/ an' don't hurry home on my account; I shall do well enough You can devote yourself wholly to looking after Helen ant the Count without regard to me. Keep them together ant away from the city as long as you can. There is nothing lik a course at a summer hotel or watering-place when you havE once got the inside track. You know your philosophic friend Boggs, says that the elective affinity of the sexes follows the law of gravitation and increases inversely as the square of thi distance, and that nine-tenths of marriages are merely the result of propinquity. Keep them then in as close contact a: possible and in time they will coalesce." And Mr. Ledgera condescended to a delicate matrimonial pinch, and a sly con nubial wink, as he almost pushed her out of the room. Mrs. Ledgeral was delighted; she had not seen him sc vivacious and so facetious for a long time. i   CHAPTER XXIV. Arrival of the Spoondrift - Coincidences - Table-talk - The Doctor's  Conundrum - Specimen of Whoppers' style. *T  HE morning after Luther's visit to Hoboken he went down to his breakast at the usual hour. Miss Jones was at her seat in a morning robe of white embroidered muslin, so nicely got up, and fitting so neatly, that two or three of the ladies at the lower end of the table put their heads together, and pronounced it perfectly ridiculous. In fact, if it could have been proved, then and there, that it had just come from Worth's, it could not have more justly excited their honest indignation. "The idea! An old maid, forty years old if she is a single day, although she calls herself thirty-five, to go and dress like a girl of twenty; and such extravagance! Says it's all machine, and that she did it herself. Don't believe a word of it. More likely she got it at Stewart's, and ran in debt for it." "But they wouldn't trust her at Stewart's." "I shouldn't think they would-a woman that would wear such an absurd little cap, blue and orange bows; just like a flock of humming birds; because she thinks she has got such a delicate complexion! That ridiculous fellow, Whoppers, humbugged her one day, by telling her that her cheeks were like primroses." "More like a peony, I think." "Yes, or like a hard-burned brick; and look at the size of it. Why don't she wear a decent-sized cap,-or go with- out, if she wishes to show that she hasn't any gray hairs,- instead of that little unbecoming finnicky thing, hardly large enough to cover the bald spot on the top of her head?"   450        1A -LVERt A GA iZr. Mr. Whoppers sat in his usual seat, and in his usual po-- sition, that is sideways, or ibias" as Miss Jones called it with his elbow resting on the table, and the morning paper in his hand. As Luther entered, Mr. Whoppers handed the journal to him. o 'There's good news for you, he cried; there in the shipping list. Arrived yesterday afternoon, the Spoondrift, Captain Combings, one hundred and ten days from Sidney, New South Wales." Luther scanned the paper with avidity, and fastened his eyes upon the item, so that he did not observe the sudden start of his hostess, or her heightened color. The coffee-urn concealed her confusion from the more acute eyes -of the ladies; but it was noticed that she allowed the hot water to dribble over the clean cloth, and actually put in three lumps of sugar to Luther's cup instead of two. She recovered her- self, however, in time to look downright mad, as Mrs. Lunsly remarked to Mrs. Bignall, when Mr. Whoppers suggested that the Captain might want his old room,-fortunately vacant-- and might be expected to ring the bell at any moment. Mr. Whoppers' words were hardly out of his mouth when the door-bell did ring, and the Captain's voice was heard in the hall. It is curious how frequently these little coincidences occur. a Speak of the devil," is a proverb in all languages. And not alone little coincidences, but many striking and wonderful ones, happening in the course of each individual life, leave but few excited minds unbewildered by their glare. They are the great, but not the peculiar, staple of the novelist. They play as important a part in real life as in the pages of fiction. They are the pabulum of spiritualism, and superstition, and quackery. , If one-half of all that the majority of men think, know, and believe is wrong and- false; the coincidence of events and circumstances that have no real connection, and the sustenance thus afforded to the illogical faculty, will be found at the bottom of the trouble. And no wonder, perhaps, when we consider the wonderful character sometimes of the   NEz VER AGAIN.         45, coincidence. We have half a mind to stop here and relate a case in point that actually occurred. We will, since it is not at all necessary that the reader should stop with us. It was on the broad Atlantic, below the Island of Tene- riffe, and on the deck of a man-of-war, commanded by a rough sailor of the old school. Excessively eccentric and irascible,  he had acquired by his strange freaks, and ebullitions of tem-, per, the sobriquet of Mad Jack. He was known also to be excessively uxorious, fond of talking about his wife, and des- perately anxious for news from Boston. A young man, having a close resemblance to the writer, but alas! with a difference for which Time is justly to be blamed-a passenger in the Captain's cabin, having no official connection with the ship- was standing among a group of officers, with a spy-glass in his hand directed to a distant sail, that was just lifting her top- sails above the horizon. The Captain bustled out of his cabin in his usual impetuous and impatient manner. "What's that! What's that!" he exclaimed without deigning a glance at the distant ship. The, glimmer of a good joke flashed through the idle brain of the youngster. Does the reader understand what it is, or rather was, to joke with a Captain of a man-of-war, on his own quarter-deck? The folly of such a performance can- not perhaps be fully conceived by a landsman. Knowing the Captain's desire to hear from Boston, but having no personal knowledge of that intellectual city; and having only, to his shame be it slid, the most vague and indefinite associations with any notable body or thing Bostonian, the young man, dropping the spy-glass, replied jokingly, with the first name that came into his head. "Oh 01, she's the Josiah Quincy of Boston." Instantly, without listening for another word, and without waiting for the intervention of the officer of the deck, the Captain shouted out orders for a change in the corvette's course. 'Not a word of explanation could be got in, and the frightened joker saw the yards braced up and the spanker hauled out, and in less than two minutes the ship standing close hauled for the stranger, while the Captain bustled back into his cabin.   45 2        nAE VER AGAI2V. "Well, if you don't catch it!" said one officer. "The old man will go stark staring mad, when we over. haul her," said another. "What could possess you? She is not even an American, to judge by the set of her sails," exclaimed a third. The stranger, seeing the alteration in the frigate's course, altered her course to match, and, the two vessels rapidly approaching each other, she soon backed her main topsail under the stern of the man-of-war. The Captain rushed firom his cabin, mounted the poop-deck, and seized the trumpet himself. "What ship is that?" Imagine the amazement of the 'group of officers and the almost consternation of the reckless joker, when the answer came back-"The Quincy of Boston." "How long out?" demanded the Captain. "Three weeks." "Got any letters for anybody?" 6"Not a letter." "Got any newspapers?" "Not a newspaper." "Well, fill' away, sir. You're a d-d pretty fellow tc come out without any newspapers. I'd like to have you on board here about ten minutes; I'd teach you. Fill away, sir; fill away," and cursing and grumbling, the irate Captain dove down again into his cabin. It was with difficulty that the companions of the young man could disabuse their minds of a belief in some special power of vision that had enabled him to read the name on the stern of the stranger when her hull was below the hori zon; or, bating that manifest impossibility, to resist the suggestion that some intimate relations with the Evil One had endowed him with a supernatural power of guessing th names of any and all vessels afloat. Ten thousand failureE would have been forgotten in the brilliancy of that one single successful hit, which was nothing but a coincidence, almos infinitely more lucky than likely.   NE VER AGAIN.        453 Captain Combings' rubicund face glowed with added color, and his eyes beamed with unwonted light at the reception that awaited him. More than half the boarders rose from the- table to grasp his hand, and expressions of welcome were showered on all sides. Even Dr. Droney condescended to say that " he was gratified to observe that God had seen fit to preserve a person for whom he had so much respect through all the perils of the great deep." But it was when it came the turn of Miss Jones and the Captain that the scene reached its highest manifestations of pleasing and profound sentiment. The Captain worked his way steadily to the head of the table. Miss Jones rose from her seat, every little bow and frill quivering with delight. The Captain squared himself, gave one glance alow and aloft; took in, in an instant, every little perfection of hull and rig- ging; and bowed two or three times in his most impressive quarter-deck style. Miss Jones responded with a graceful courtesy, and extended her hand, which the Captain seized in both of his and retained longer than was at all necessary, according to Miss Billings, who said she "believed he squeezed it-Miss Jones turned so red in the face." At any rate, Mis's Jones had to struggle a little to get it away. "Oh, Captain, we are delighted!" But the Captain's look of intense admiration cut short the complimentary speech-she hung her head and dropped into her chair, while he continued bowing, and blandly smiling. "We are delighted," she resumed, "that you have got safe back again. Come, Captain, here is a vacant seat-do you take coffee or tea?  "Pardon me: I kept you standing," replied the Captain glancing round the table, " but we sailors are a singular set, and when we meet such a beautiful, neatly rigged craft, we forget ourselves. I hope you will excuse me. I was too busy ducking my flag, and lowering my topsails, but it was all out of admiration." And the Captain pointed the compli- ment by placing his hand on his heart, and again bowing to Miss Jones.   454        NE VER AGA N. " Was there ever such a monster ?" -Miss Billings would have parodied Trinculo, and exclaimed, "a most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a plain overdressed old maid ! " Miss Jones hardly knew which way to turn, and had to hide her face behind the coffee-urn, while theCaptain dropped into the chair at her side. For a few moments his attention was taken in reply to the inquirers as to his voyage and adventures, and the conversa- tion became quite general. "Very sweet, Captain ?" murmured Miss Jones, with the sugar-tongs in her hand. "Very sweet," replied the Captain, soZto zoce, and looking Miss Jones full in the eyes. " Sarah, bring some hot hash for the Captain. You will' take hash, Captain ?" " Certainly, my dear Miss Jones. As Speed says, ' though the chameleon love can feed on air, I am one that am nour- ished by my victuals, and would fain have meat. " "; Ah! Captain, you don't like hash then; let me order you a mutton-chop or a beef-steak." "No, no, thank you. I am not that ravenous that hash will not serve my turn. Few things are better than hash," observed the Captain aloud, "especially when the chopping- knife has been plied under the supervision of such bright eyes as those of our hostess." Miss Jones' blushes tumbled, a perfect cataract of color, from her cheeks, down her dimpled neck, until they could be seen flashing their crimson tints through the fluttering folds of her chemisette. " Did you ever ?" said Miss Billings to her neighbor. "No I never! " replied Mrs. Bignall. "Hash,5 continued the Captain sententiously, "is first cousin to lobscouse, and lobscouse is food for kings. Pardon me, ladies; I should say food for queens." "Lobscouse! lobscouse!   Oh, Captain, what is lob- scouse ?" chorused half-a-dozen voices. The Captain gravely shook his head. "Lobscouse is a  NE VE R A GA IN.       455 mystery,-it would take me an hour at least to explain. I will, however, give the cook a lesson some day, and she shall show you what it is,-that is, with the permission of our fair hostess." "Oh, certainly, Captain," murmured Miss Jones. "Any- thing you please, Captain; it Inust be lovely." "But do you always eat lobscouse at sea?" inquired Miss Billings. "Oh ! no, ma'am; if we did, we should have everybody going to sea. We often have to come down to chickens and duff." "Chickens! oh dear, do you have chickens?  How do you get them at sea ?" "Catch them," interposed Mr. Whoppers.  "Off Cape Horn is a good place,-they always havefoul weather there." "Pshaw, Mr. Whoppers! how can you make a pun upon such a sublime subject?  'The sea, the sea, the rolling sea.'" " No pun at all, Miss Billings. You've heard of the wings of the wind, haven't you ? Well you take a chopping sea and slice off a wing and serve it up, hot or cold, depending upon your latitude, with a nice roll of the sea stuffed with currents." "The mighty deep must truly be a sublime object," inter- posed Dr. Droney. "I should like very much to contem- plate it; I don't mean from the sea-shore. That pleasure it has pleased Providence to grant me, on sundry and divers occasions, from the piazza of the hotel at Long Branch; but I mean from some point on the broad ocean." "You mean, Doctor, you would like to go down in the horse latitudes, and time the sea running, and watch the jockey waves in their white caps comb the Spanish main." "How can you be so absurd ?" ejaculated Mrs. Lasher. "I beg your pardon, Mrs. Lasher; you may be a judge of all kinds of land spirits. I never said you were not, but you don't understand the spirits of the vasty deep. There is nothing absurd in what I have said. If the Doctor goes down into the great deep, he will come up again with a white   456       .   iNEVER AGAIN. cap and a piece of real salt spray stuck in it; and that you must admit would be a feather in his cap ! Don't you think so, Mrs. Lasher ? And I do hope that if he encounters any hur- rican6s he will select the biggest and put a head on it. You know he can take the head off a head sea and bring it home with him; one good blow with such a cane would send all the Spencerites and Darwinites scudding." The Doctor gave a groan, and trying to swallow a sip of tea at the same time, there was for a few moments a terrible sputtering.            . "Or perhaps, Doctor, you mean that you would like to get into an inland sea. That would suit you better. . Say an Episcopal see-the see of New York or New Jersey, for instance." "I mean, sir, what I say, sir. I always mean what I say. I should like to launch my bark upon the broad ocean. I should like to see the glory of God and His wonders in the great deep. I should like to see what the illimitable expanse of the ocean is like." "Like ! I don't think 'you would like it at all. Take my word for it, Doctor, it isn't a likely place; you'd find it a retched affair; you'd soon get sick of it; and as for your bark -well, your bark would be a great deal better than your bite, even if you did not find your bark drowned by the howl of the winds and waves. Content yourself in marine matters with the sea-shore and the docks and wharves, and now and then getting half seas over and taking a roll on the beach, or under |1  the beeches; it's all the same thing you know, when you are in that condition of see-saw that you say you would like to be in. I've had experience, and I can tell you that it is a great deal nicer to see a ship than to ship a sea. And think of another fact, Doctor, that the raging billows are never con- tent with heaving up the ship, they'd make you heave up too. I'm told its harder on clergymen than other people." "Why so, sir ? " demanded the Doctor. "Because your profession is one that makes it, almost for, any reason, a sin to throw up. I don't say that you would go'    INEVER AGAIN.         457 as far as that, but if you should happen to over-eat yourself, land, from what the Captain says of lobscouse, that might hap- pen, you would unquestionably have to throw up your sur- plice. ' Besides," continued the incorrigible Whoppers, "the sea is not much to see; it is no great shakes; it is no better than :a street row!" "A street row!" exclaimed the Doctor. "What nonsense, 'sir. How is the sea like a street row?" ' "Ladies and gentlemen," said Mr. Whoppers, giving a slight tap on the table,-" the Doctor does us the honor to 'propose a conundrum-" "I have proposed no conundrum," testily interposed the Doctor. "I never did propose a conundrum." "Oh yes, you did, sir. You asked why the ocean is like a street row. Isn't that a conundrum? Ladies, can any of you 'answer the Doctor's conundrum? You can't? Well I think I :can-guess it. It's because there is plenty of breakers o'head. Good, isn't it? Doctor, I'll mark you down one." ' The Doctor shoved back his chair in sheer disgust, and -was followed by the sympathizing Mrs. Lasher and Miss Bil- lings. To be accused thus publicly of making a conundrum- 'to have a pun thrust upon him at the breakfast-table in this outrageous way-it was too much-it was more than clerical flesh and blood could bear! Something must be done. Whoppers was getting to be intolerable; he must be quelled, 'subdued, reduced to order, and taught the respect that is due to the cloth! The Doctor was not a ready man, but with proper premedi- :tation he was' powerful. He would concoct a reproof that 'would wither Whoppers. Mrs. Lasher and Miss Billings prom- ised to assist in its administration. 'He had several times :deeply offended both ladies, and though not drawing very close together in other matters they both felt alike in this, that, if the Doctor could once get the offender fairly down, they would gladly join'hands, or rather tongues, in a little feminine objurgation.   458         NE VER AGAIN. Luther had been impatiently waiting for the Captain to finish his breakfast. The Captain, however, glowing and expanding with more than his usual benignity under the smiles of Miss Jones, seemed in no hurry, and the lady herself evidently felt none of her usual impatience for the conclusion of the meal. The insinuating persistence with .vhich she pressed plate after plate of buckwheat cakes upon her guest was remarked by all lingering at the table, and by none more clearly than by Mr. Whoppers, who, alternately sipping his coffee and running his eye over the newspaper, seemed to have his attention fully employed. "Do, Captain, try these. These are beauties. The first that come up are never so nice; it is only towards the last that you can get them really crisp and beautiful." "I suppose later the griddle gets hotter, my dear Miss Jones?" "Yes, and the batter gets smoother and stronger." "Typical, isn't it?" demanded the Captain, with a sly look that made Miss Jones drop her eyes to her plate. "Of what, you would ask? of love, my dear Miss Jones. The first ladleful of fond fancies-that Cupid tries to cook, almost always turn out pale, flabby affairs. But wait a while, and then you have the crisp, well-done article. The griddle is hotter, my dear Miss Jones, and frequent stirring has made, as you say, the batter stronger and smoother." "Hurry up them cakes!" ejaculated Mr. Whoppers. "Dear me, Mr. Whoppers, do you want a plate of fresh cakes? Here, Sarah." "Oh no, Madam. No more cakes for me. I was only thinking that if a fellow does wait till the griddle is hot, the cakes will cool unless you hurry 'em up. Good-morning, Miss Jones. "Good-morning, Captain," and Mr. Whoppers rose from the table and strolled out of the room, and his example was immediately followed by Luther and the Captain. "Oh, Captain, I am so glad you have got back," exclaimed Luther as he led the way into his own room, and, shutting the door, turned and seized the Captain's hand. r  "      '         i? ;..   NEVER AGAIN.          459 #*Are you, my dear boy? Well, I am delighted to get back myself. I ought to have been in ten days ago, but good news always sails with double-reefed topsails; her sheets  hauled well aft; while bad news shakes out every thing and keeps stun-sails set every minute from tripping to mooring." By which figure," said Luther, "I am to understand that you have something pleasant to tell." "Exactly; and first and foremost the voyage has been gen- erally a most successful one. Have had a good run out and back; cargo delivered in fine order; ship sails like a witch. You should see her on a bowline! and so weatherly! No slumping off to leeward like a parson preaching politics. She makes a close point, and weathers on it. But there is no use in praising her. She'll do, and I tell you what, we have made a good thing in buying into her. God bless you, my boy, for it, and after you your old Frenchwoman. May you both live to see the Spoondrift die a natural death and be broken up for fire-wood, and that will be nigh on to a hundred years, if there is any virtue in copper bolts, live-oak futtocks, and locust top-timbers. "But I must tell you about our venture," continued the Captain, "your venture, rather. Nothing could be luckier. The market was completely bare of everything in the way of Yankee notions. There wasn't a pail, churn, bowl, or wooden spoon in town. Not even a clothes-pin, and as for clocks, why every woman and child in Sydney was. hankering after a wooden clock. I just cleared out the whole lot in a lump, and as the fellow offered one hundred per cent. profit, and cash down, I thought I wouldn't try to brace up any closer on that tack. You can pay back your loan to Madame Steig- litz, and chalk yourself up a clean five thousand!" Instead of expressing any elation, Luther replied with a downright doleful look, and a shake of the head. The Captain was astonished and disturbed. "Why, Luther, you didn't dream of over a hundred per cent. did you? You did not expect to more than double your money, did you?-"   "O        A NEVER AGAIN. The Captain repeated his question in such an anxious and lugubrious tone that it made Luther laugh outright. "My good friend, pardon me. I received your good news with an ill grace. Five thousand dollars! why it's a fortune, or rather it's the germ of a fortune; what an acorn is tG an oak, five thousand dollars is to a fortune. It contains, as Dr. Johnson would phrase it, the potentiality of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice. I have heard that it was a saying of Astor, that his first thousand cost him more trouble than his millions did afterward. I ought to jump for joy, and if you had arrived about ten days ago, I suppose I should have given a specimen of my agility, but now, Captain, I have got some. thing that weighs me down. I am good for nothing, in a sal- tatory way, but a clog-dance. You said that I could pav the money I owe Madame Steignitz. Alas! that is just what I can't do. I can find no Madame Steignitz to pay it to." The Captain jumped up from his chair, and put his hand on Luther's shoulder. "What do you mean?" he exclaimed. "Just what I say,-that I can find no Madame Steignitz to pay it to." "Run under?  Gone down? demanded the Captain with an expressive gesture. "No! that is, I hope not, and I think not;" and Mr. Whoppers here thinks as I do," replied Luther, opening the door in answer to a slight tap and ushering the Editor into the room. "I do. I thought differently at first, but I quite agree with our young friend now," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers; " the old woman hasn't gone under yet, I'm sure, but she has got among the breakers, and there is no telling how lohg she will last. But I want you to come down to my room. Boggs is there, and we'll have a regular conspiracy. He is quite inter- ested in the affair, and I don't know a fellow whose opinion on matters and things in general I'd take sooner than Boggs'. Socially, Boggs is a humbug, but strip off his kid gloves, and you won't easily find a fellow who can hit out straighter or harder, physically, intellectually, or morally than Boggs. ,. .   NE VER A4 GAI.         461 Come down, come down, or I shall bring him up here. There is more room in my quarters. Come down Captain, and Lu- ther shall go over the whole story." Bustling about his room, Whoppers arranged seats, and rubbed his hands with delight. Here was an inkling of real adventure. Here was the beginning of an actual acted maga- zine romance. Wouldn't he dress it all up and fill in all the details and give character, conversation, and incident all as large as life and a little larger, and not a newspaper reporter should know a word of it until it appeared in the Universe? The Captain explained that he was pressed for time and must be back to his shjp within an hour, at the farthest, but Luther had not half finished his story before he quite got over his hurry. Mr. Boggs also grew thoroughly excited, although with him it was much more purely an intellectual problem. He had no personal interest in the old woman, except so far as her oddities of character or manner, as detailed by Luther, excited his curiosity, but he felt strongly the detective spirit, which more or less animates us all when we have presented to us a case of mysterious crime. And he felt fiercely the hunting instinct, the desire to pursue and run down something or somebody,-the disposition to follow the furtive common to dogs and men;--which was in his case intensified by the unconscious longing of a vigorous animality to escape for a while from the utterly inane and stupid conventionalities of society, and from the lazy, lounging unexciting life of a society- man. As the reader is acquainted with the facts, so far as Luther could relate them, it would be a waste of time to go into all the details of the conference. There could be but one opinion as to the necessity of find- ing out, as a first step, the haunts and abodes of the suspected parties. This could only be done by Luther himself, as he alone had a sufficiert idea of their personal appearance, while at the same time he himself was to them quite unknown, or at least so little known that a moderate disguise would answer the purposes of perfect concealment. o           .      .   "2        NE VER AGA IN. But what kind of disguise? it was evident that the search must be pursued in some kind of character. It would never do for him to visit all the low cafes and foreign drinking-dens in the city dressed up in the usual style of young and genteel America. A hundred suspicious eyes would mark him in an instant; and, if the objects of his search were at all on their guard, his quest would fail, even if he himself came by no per. sonal misadventures. The difficulty was settled by a propo. sition from the Captain, the nature and character of which will develop itself in due course. It met with unanimous ap. probation. "Just the thing," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers; " between .you both you won't have to make-believe more than half the char- acter; and, by-the-by, I will have the things to rig out Luther down at my editorial rooms. My office will be a good point of departure." "But, "- exclaimed Luther, addressing the Captain, "how can you afford the time? I cannot lose a day, and the affairs of the Spoondrift are also urgent." ("I must manage it somehow, my dear boy," replied the Captain. "The Spoondrift can't begin to unload for a week yet, and in the meantime somebody must look out. for her. Meet me on board of her in a couple of hours, and I will have it all settled, and we will then go up to Mr. Whoppers' office in Park Row, and take our departure at once." "And I am to be left out of the adventure altogether," said Mr. Boggs, reproachfully, almost mournfully. Mr. Boggs at heart knew that he had been masquer- ading all his life in the character of a society-man, and at times he was very much bored; at times he felt horribly disgusted with himself. Here was a chance to try a little masquerading in another line. He had an instinct, ive longing to step out of his habitual sphere; to seriously knock against something or somebody; to prove to himself that he had the thlews -and sinews of a man. He felt that he had talents and energies which had never been exer- cised, but he knew it was too late now for more than a fitful   ANE VER AGA IN.         463 spurt into the regions of adventure-for more than a short turn now and then, with the actual hard-hitting realities of vulgar life. He knew that, alas! he was a society-man- nothing but a society-man; better, perhaps, than most of his class, inasmuch as he felt the sad fact to his very vitals. Years of balls, receptions, operas, dinners, petits solpers at Delmonico's, and t/hes ttanzsants at Sharon and Newport had done their work upon him, and melted his will to wax. At times he felt his demoralizatitn acutely and mourned it heartily; at times, when wandering into the courts of law- when sitting under the pulpit oratory of St. Thomas', or St. Mark's, or St. Bartholomew's or Grace Church-or when listening to some learned lecture at Steinway Hall or the Cooper Institute,--or when noticing Parker or Agnew, or Vanburen or Wood, or a dozen others rolling from their crowded consultation-rooms to appointments at College and Hospital, and bearing to both the results of a life-long devotion of the highest talents to the noblest of arts,-at such times he could not help feeling a pang of envy none the less acute because modified by a sentiment of contempt for himself. At times he even envied men of his own class -men intellectually his inferiors, and just as useless. At times he envied, and with reason, Jules Harding, who keeps up a fair degree of mental as well as physical stamina by oc- casional trips around the world. He also envied at times Sholty Lento, his impassibility and self-conceit, his utter inability to comprehend how big a fool he is, and how 'Jig a bore all the girls think him. He sometimes envied Billy Burbank his complete absorption in the onerous duties of chief gossip-monger and- tittle-tattle-bearer in society. He even envied Pete Lumley, not his ability to make vers de societ, but his surprising ability of belief in them as poetry, after they were made, and his intense faith in the fact, patent to every one, that the Graces had been even still more kind to him than the Muses-his complete and absorb- ing conviction that not a young girl in society had the least idea that the season of the sere and yellow leaf had   "4         NEV ER' A GA IN.  advanced upon him, or that if it had, there was any. thing more than a slight change of foliage, infinitely more beautiful and enchanting than the crude green of early spring time. Mr. Boggs envied at times all these, but it was a harmless and innocent envy. It was but the scum of bubbling emotion that at bottom was rather creditable than otherwise. It simply indicated higher instincts, and a clearer self-apprecia. tion at such instants than usual. It was nothing more or less than part and parcel of the feeling that made him join so heartily in a portion of the general confession. He did not heed much the words "we have done many things which we ought not to have done," for Mr. Boggs didn't believe that he had done many things that he ought not to have done, or that, under the same circumstances, he would not do again, but, at the words " we have left undone many things that we ought to have done," his heart always gave a jump up towards his throat, and he always felt perfectly willing to add the supplication--"Lord, have mercy upon us miserable sinners." Mr. Boggs, then, as the Captain spoke, could not conceal his mortification at seeing the chance of something-to-do slip away from--you are going to leave me out/of the adventure. "Not at all," exclaimed both the Captain and Mr. Whop- pers. "There is no adventure as yet. Luther has to find the game first before we can run it down. There'll be an adventure then, and a pretty desperate one too. I think we shall want your aid then, sure." "Well, promise me that you won't take any important step without consulting me." "Oh, no fear of that," replied Mr. Whoppers, " and to make sure of it suppose we all agree to meet here each night at ten, for consultation and to hear a report from Luther and the Captain." ' I am afraid, said Luther, there will be nothing to report." "Well then, we shall be quite as well off as the Historical Society, or the American Institute ; we'll have a report perhaps about nothing, but at any rate we'll have a report." "With this understanding the Captain, Luther, and Mr.   NE VER A GAIN.         465 Boggs took their departure, while Mr. Whoppers settled him- self, first to making a few notes of consultation, which could be amplified to any extent, when he came to write out in all its de- tails the whole story for the Universe, and then to the finish- ing of one of his most slashing editorials. Master of a vigor- ous sledge-hammer style, nothing the Editor of the Universe liked better than to "pitch in," as he phrased it, to any and all of the "isms" of the day: but what particularly excited his ire was any effort to effect by legislation reforms that are wholly within the province of society-any perversions of the power of government to the purposes of rampant and confi- dent, but ignorant and ill-considered philanthropy--any attempt by direct force of law to make men more godly, more temper- ate, more abstinent, or more continent than they are compelled to be by the slowly improving moral sense of the community. The text of the article before him was a remark of the great thinker of the age, Herbert Spencer, dc profos of the efforts made by Cromwell and the Puritans of Englandc to suppress all kinds of ungodliness. "What, now, was the result of this attempt to dragoon men into virtue! What came when the strong man who thought he was thus helping ' God to mend all,' died? a dreadful reaction brought in one of the most degraded periods of our history. Into the newly-garnished house entered 'seven other spirits more wicked than the first.' For generations, the English character was lowered: vice was gloried in; virtue was ridi- culous; profaneness and obscenity flourished ; high aspirations ceased ; the whole age was corrupt." Mr. Whoppers' pen, with an ironical and sarcastic twist in it-best indicated perhaps for the reader's contemptous judg- ment by the following extract-ran rapidly over the paper: Alas! the Maine Liquor Law has never been thoroughly enforced vet. And it never will be until we are agitated up to the proper mark, until we are willing to begin at the begin- ning-hang all the distillers and brewers, and sentence every fellow found with a lager jug or a pewter pint-pot in his hand to six months of penitential-psalm singing on Graham bread   "6         NE VE R A GAIN. and water. Sunday Observances have not yet been enforced with sword and bayonet; and there is no law by which the wicked wretch who looks upon every seventh day as a day of rest and relaxation, and a time for the enjoyment of the beauties of nature and art, can be shot down at once, if he steps over his own door-sill, except on his way to church. The tobacco sin has not yet received its full and proper attention. Think bf the lectures, and speechifications, and conventions, and collections, that will have to be made before the extirpation of the evil, and the coming of that glorious time when the miserable devotees of nicotine shall be com- pelled to flee to the wildest recesses of the Alleghanies and the Rocky Mountains. I will indulge myself for a moment with a picture which my imagination conjures up, but which at the rate we are "progressing"-I believe that is the phrase-will perhaps, ere long, be gloriously realized. I fancy I see a group of pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking chewers and smokers flying, like the old Covenanters of Scotland, before their unrelenting foes, who have followed, with godly perseverance,. their trails of tobacco-spittle from valley to valley, from crag to crag. I see the fugitives, worn out and exhausted, partly by the :,; of the weed, and partly by the rapidity of their flight and the obstacles of the road, as they halt in some supposed place of safety. Each man draws his tobacco-pouch from his pocket, and proceeds at once to fill and light his pipe or to mumble - his quid. The odorous smoke rises amid' the umbrageous foliage; it floats on the balmy air of the wilderness, and, for the first time, in this secluded spot, since the great fiat of crea- tion, it affronts the proboscis of the astonished mosquito. The tobacco-spit trickles down the mossy rocks, spots the flowery- sward, and tints the surface of the limpid lake. Lapped in nicotinean elysium, the incautious worshippers of the weed recline in fancied security, and dreamily talk of the glorious olden time when the spittoon was a necessity of household tidiness; when bunches of golden Havanas hung in every shop-window, and fine-cut and pig-tail flowed in the streets like water. Suddenly, with a yell that fairly makes the peaks of the. mountains tremble on their rocky basis, there bursts upon them, through an unguarded mountain-pass, a legion of strong- minded philanthropists, male and female, all astraddle of the biggest and most rampant hobbies, and led by a gallant Boston Claverhouse. Who can depict the scene that ensues? \.!   NE VER AGAIN.         467 the consternation of the despairing but desperate band, on the one hand; or the dash, the spirit, the elan, as the French call it, on the other-of the gleaming legion that, with flowing reins and bloody rowels, leaps the crest of the mountain and sweeps down the gorge, each man with a pistol in one Iand and a sword in the other, and each woman armed in the same. manner, with the addition of a double-edged bowie-knife held firmly in her teeth. "One volley from your electric twenty-barrelled revolvers. and then, in the name of St. Philips and our puritan ances- tors, upon them with the cold steel!" shouts the Bostonian Claverhouse. "Hack and hew!" scream his lieutenants, quoting the Bible, just as if they believed in it. "Hack and hew! even as Asa hewed Zera and his hundred thousand Ethiopians in the valley of Zephatha. Smite and spare not! for have we not sworn with a loud voice, before the Lord, and with shouting and with trumpets, and with much blowing in the daily journals, even as did Benjamin and Judah, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, at the words of Azariah, that whosoever will not seek the Lord of Massachusetts, and the nations lying around about and there- unto appertaining, shall be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman? And shall we not do even as we have covenanted before the Lord? Shall we not sternly execute the law in such cases?hade and provided? Shall we not utterly destroy these idolaters, and their friends who have joined themselves unto them-the wine-bibbers and the drinkers of lager, and the drinkers of coffee, and the drinkers of tea: and lay waste their high places, and cut down their idols, even as the king of Israel cut down the idol of Maachah, his mother; and spoil all their shops and their stores, and smite all their farm-houses and their shanties, even as the king of Israel aforesaid spoiled all the cities, and smote all the tents round about Gerar.? On! on, 'then! let us do swiftly a mighty work-the work of the Lord!" The battle rages'! swords rise and fall with the rapidity and regularity of flails on a barn floor at a threshing-bee. The gleam of ten thousand bowie-knives lights up, with a terrific glare, the sombre hemlock foliage of the secluded valley. The brook for a while flows with blood and water, but soon the crimson tide coagulates and dams itself with huge clots. Pipes and cigars fall from lips quivering in death, and. quids jump from gaping mouths as the severed    "8         NEVER AGAIN. heads bound down the reddened rocks and roll along through the bloody bushes.  Morality and  philanthropy, and the laws of a paternal government have triumphed! The last smoker has smoked his last pipe; the last chewer has chewed his last quid; or, as Tennyson, or Longfellow, or some other poet beautifully but mournfully expresses it: "No more, no more, fine cut or twisted plug Shall pouch the chewer's lean and ugly mug. No more, no more, the circumgyral smoke Shall tuneful Bigger's mighty wrath provoke. No more, no more, the ambrosial reek shall flout A Chouser's pious eyes or saintly snout. No more shall brave and burly Belcher sniff The scent of hell in every passing whiff. No more the mandrake voice of fluent Bing Shall round and round St. Martha's chancel ring, With curses dark and dire, alike invoked On Cuba's best or meanest Dutch that's smoked. No more shall guileless Growley grimly feed His sacred ire upon the slav'rous weed ; Or waste his time, or spend his strength and wit In damming floods of vile tobacco-spit." The victors stop only to lift the hair of their foes, thus beautifully tinting the amenities of civilized warfare with the more energetic coloring of unsophisticated life. Then, sol emnly chanting Yankee-Doodle, and bearing proudly aloft the loaded scalp-poles devoted to the adornment and decora- tion of the high altar of Faneuil Hall and the lecture-room of the Cooper Institute, they return to a regenerate and happy community where everybody has the glorious privilege of thinking and speaking, and eating and drinking, just as he pleases, provided he thinks, speaks, eats and drinks precisely as the good people, who know everything and more too, shall decide in their own minds, and by their own peculiar intu- itions and inspirations, to be consistent with the good of the world and the will of God, not forgetting the immediate delectation and emphysematous glorification of his self-sty!ed saints and prophets. But enough-or, as the reader probably thinks, more than enough-of editorial slangwhanging.  The excuse, how- ever, for giving these specimens of Whoppers' brutal style, is the received dictum that "style is the man," and that some times, in the interests of character drawing, it is as well to quote what a man writes as what he says.   CHAPTER XXV. The Hudson-American endings-The distinguished party arrive at the Point-Helen's meditations-Mrs. Struggles and the Count. HE glories of the Hudson! Yes, the Hudson is a glori- ous river; but is there any use of our making such an everlasting brag and boast about it as we do? True, we have Anglo-Saxon blood in our veins; and everything of ours is of course the greatest, the finest, the best, or else the poorest, the meanest, the smallest the world can show. That is nat- ural and comes by inheritance, but we need not intensify our brag in such matters as natural scenery by the gaping, gawkey exaggerations of provincial ignorance. While lauding our Abanas and Pharphars, we should not forget or despise the Jordans of other people. The Rhine has perhaps justly sunk somewhat in public estimation, but no American ever sailed down through the hills of the upper Danube, or across the broad plains of Hungary, perhaps when at flood the mighty river stretches for a score of miles on either side,-a great lake or sea dotted with hamlets and towns, and groves of magnificent trees, and little, islets on which are huddled for refuge vast herds of cattle,-or glided on the rushing waters along the rocks, still bearing the marks of the road-way of Trajan's egions, and so on through the frowning Iron Gates, but must adv nit that even in rivers we are not so far ahead of all the rest of the world. The question of mountains is still more easily settled. Luckily the height of the Himalayas is a school-book fact, and for anything approximating Mont Blanc we have to go two or three thousand miles away to the Rocky Mountains and the   470        NE VE R A GAIN. Sierra Nevada. If there is anything that an American ought to be profoundly thankful for, it is that the Catskills are only good-sized hills, and that neither the Alleghanies nor the White Mountains have a peak twenty thousand feet high. If they had, it -is to be feared. that there would roll down upon us such an avalanche of brag that every particle of sense, modesty, and taste would be swamped forever. Still the Hudson, taken moderately, is a glorious river, with a good deal of very fine and varied scenery in its course. The geological freak of the Palisades is unquestionably strik- ing; the expansions of Tappan Sea and Havelrstraw Bay are, with the graceful outlines and picturesque fillings in of the wooded hills sloping down with more or less abruptness to the town and villa-dotted shore, an unquestionably pleasing and scenically satisfactory sight, while the reach of the Highlands, especially if approached by a stranger without a preliminary course of great expectations, is really superb-almost grand --and very beautiful. The Count was loud in his expressions of delighted admi- ration as the boat bearing Mrs. Ledgeral's party entered the strait between St. 'Anthony's Nose and Stony Point. He had visited the Trossachs; had boated on Lake Wallenstadt and the Bay of Uri; had steamed through the Iron Gates; had strolled from Trefoy up the Stelvio in the shadow of the great Orte!er Spitz; had gazed from the Gorner Grats, at the  awful range of Alpine monsters glittering with glaciers, ad had studied the majesty of Mont Blanc with his attendant Aiguilles from the heights of the Brevant, and of course he did not make the mistake of applying to the Highlands of the Hudson any of the common tourist epithets of grand, majes- tic, sublime, or wonderful. -^ Helen sat silent, and only partly listening to the conversa- tion going on between the different members of the party, which included, besides her mother and the Count, the two Miss Honesdales, who were going up to the Point for a short run around among the cadets and officers, under the gua'dian- ship of Mrs. Ledgeral, who had accepted the responsibility,   slight as it was, with some little hesitation. The Honesdales had the reputation of being the most amiable girls and the most loving sisters in society, and Mrs. Ledgeral knew that the supervision required was only nominal-all she would have to do would be to let them take care of themselves, and go and come as it pleased them; but then there was the Count! it would never do to run any risk, and the Misses Honesdale were such nice girls. Everybody said so--that is everybody who was anybody. They were tall, good-look- ing; dressed well, danced well; and while Lizzie, the eldest, wyas musical, and had been finished by Mills and Albetus, Dolly, the youngest, showed the neatest ankle at croquet of any girl in the avenue. A bad girl to take into the country, thought Mrs. Ledgeral as she recalled the Count's often-expressed admiration of the American ladies' small feet.  But she comforted herself with the reflection that Helen's feet and ankles were equally neat and well turned, even if she did not show them quite so freely. ' And so they ought to be," muttered the fond mother as she glanced down at her own nicely shod extremities, " if she is a daughter of mine," and then she thought of a compliment that, in her younger days, when she could afford bottines of the tightest, she Ihad received almost under the shadow of Melrose. Her cairriage had drawn up at the neighboring inn. The little bustling landlady had hurried out to help her down, and the moment Mrs. Ledgeral had put her foot upon the marche pied exclaimed, "You're welcome from over the seas, my lady."' "How do you know that I'm from over the seas?" de- manded Mrs. Ledgeral. "Oh, I knew it the moment I saw your 'endings.' We get such ' endings' only from America." was the reply. Mrs. Ledgeral thought of her daughter's inherited endings, and decided to take Dolly Honesdale to West Point. Mrs, Struggles was also of I the party; she had not been urged to go-hardly even invited. But Mrs. Struggles did not need to be urged. She had the happy faculty, necessary to the struggling woman, of converting the slightest intimations   47 2        NE VER A GAIN.  or suggestions into pressing invitations; and so she was of the party; and not the least delighted member of it. Not that she cared anything for the ordinary commonplace pleasures of such a trip. She had no love for the country, no eye for natural scenery, no particular pleasure in fresh air; but then the party was so exclusive, and a visit to West Point, in the right kind of company, is preeminently the proper thing; and then she would have such stories to tell when she got back of all the little adventures of the distinguished party, and an end- less quantity of sly, but seemingly careless allusions as to what "me and the Count" had seen and done when "we was'"at West Point together. She felt that she would be able to cap Mrs. Insby's. anecdotes of the Prince and the Duke, and Lord this and Lord that, and fairly bluff the Hazencourts off the course with their poor German Baron and their miserable un. washed Portuguese Don. "Oh Count," exclaimed Mrs. Struggles, putting the usual American question, " do you think this as fine as the Rhine?" "Well, Madam," he said hesitatingly, " the two rivers are very unlike. This is as beautiful, but the Rhine is a very in- teresting river." "Oh yes; you mean its ruined castles." "Not alone its castles, but its romantic traditions, and its historic associations." "Oh  yes; we have no romantic traditions here,", ex- claimed. Miss Honesdale. "No, nor any historic associations," put in Dolly. Helen roused herself from her revery, and turned a swift sharp glance at the last speaker. "You don't think so, Miss Helen," smilingly demanded the Count. "I think that there is no comparison between the two riv- ers in that respect, but our Hudson is not wholly destitute of romance, and certainly not of historic ,associations. If Rip Van Winkle and Captain Kidd go for nothing, look around, and every hill and promontory speaks of one of the most piti- able tragedies in history. You have heard, Count, of the story of Andre?"   "(I remember the name, but the story dwells not strongly on my mind. Won't you have the goodness to recite it to me?" Helen rapidly ran over the chief incidents of the lamen- table tale, and the Count listened with an expression of inter- est and admiration that was very satisfactory to Mrs. Ledgeral. "Helen is as good as a book," whispered Miss Hones- dale to her sister. "As stupid as a book," returned Dolly, piqued that her chatter had failed to fix the Count's attention. "I can tell you what," returned the elder, " if you had a little more of that kind of stupidity, it would be the better for you. All men can't gabble about nothing forever, and some of the best of them don't dance." "And all men can't listen to screechy music forever. 1 guess my dancing will last as long and go as far as your singing." "Hush, didn't you promise mother not to squabble?" "' Well, who began it?" "Why, you did." "No, you did." The sudden slowing of the' engine preparatory to landing at the wharf produced a general hush throughout the boat. The engineer in handling his cut-off had cut off Helen's story and the whispered sparring of the loving sisters. 'The transi- tion from the plashings, the rumblings, and the tremblings of a full head to half steam, is startling. There is a curious question, and one -that has no doubt often occurred to the statistical mind-How many tender declarations trembling on the tongue have been indefinitely postponed by the sudden silence of shutting off steam-how many have been drowned forever in the awful whizzing of the escape-pipe. The ques- tion commends itself to the consideration of Sorosis. Per- haps the evil might be remedied by putting the cut-off and starting-bar into the softer and more delicate hands of petti- coated engineers. The boat drew up at the dock, and rapidly disembarked its passengers, who as rapidly hurried into the carriages in   474         NE VER A4 AZV. waiting, and were drawn up the steep and picturesque road through a cut in the rocks almost worthy of the epithet gorge," to the small rocky plateau on which stands perched, like an old baronial castle, on ground of greatest vantage, the magnificent hotel. Magnificent, not perhaps for its size- there are many summer hotels twice as large--but magnifi- cent from its air of architectural amplitude; its wide sweep of encircling veranda, and above, all, from its singularly bold and striking position, commanding as it does splendid views of the river, with the most charming and picturesque features of the surrounding hills. Rooms were ready for the party, and Mrs. Ledgeral and her maid were soon deep in the mysteries of the immense packing-cases, that invariably constitute the impedizwentcz of the fashionable Americaine. It is said that the nationality of an American party abroad can be recognized not only by the shape and quality of their trunks, but by the size. Whoppers says that a big trunk is as characteristic of a Yankee girl as it is of an elephant. And what do, the huge things contain? No man knows, but there have been rumors of thirty, forty, fifty, and even of eighty, dresses, for a single short summer season at Saratoga and Sharon. Surely "Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of these." Luckily West Point is not a very "dressy" place, and, besides, Mrs. Ledgeral had too much sense and taste to affect to make a blaze of gentility to the world by dress. She knew that generally the most pretentious specimens of s flashing bravery," as Ben Jonson phrases it, are women scarcely within, or who are just without, the pale of the selectest set. She knew and felt her independent position. She had brought only a dozen dresses, and yet she contemplated a month's stay. She was even debating whether she would change her dress for the evening. "Are you not going to change your dress?" she demanded of Helen. "No, mamma; I think not."   NE VE R AGAIN.         475 [ "Well, it's hardly. worth while. There is nobody here, I suppose. Still, you might find somebody in the parlor thia evening. Come, hurry; it will be time for tea, and I want to get down and see the head waiter about our places before the crowd pour in." "Oh, don't wait for me, mamma. I shan't change my dress. I am not going into the parlor this evening. I shall stay out on the piazza, the weather is so lovely," and Helen slipped out of the room, and descending the stairs; strolled out into the broad veranda which, running round the sides and end of the house, constitutes in its extent and amplitude one of the most agreeable and characteristic features of the hotel. The sun had gone down behind the western hills; but one golden gleam flashed across far overhead and gilded in the east the tip of Sugarloaf, leaving the slopes of the valley and the intervening river in the soft,gray and amber tints of advancing eve. Helen took a seat in a deserted corner of the piazza. It commanded a near view of the bluff under which Captain Combings had anchored his sloop the night of the collision. How vividly the scene came up to her mind, as she gazed at the very spot where perchance the remnant of wreck still reposed beneath the placid water. The shouts of alarm, the crash of timbers, the whizzing of steam, the rattling of blocks and boat-falls!-the huddling crowds rush- ing from cabins and state-rooms!-the fright, the confu- sion, and then the rapid return of calmness and confidence when it was found that it was only the other one that was run down and destroyed. And then Helen saw the unshipped crew clambering up the guards of the steamer, but luckily for her, as the Captain and his mates were clad only in their scanty habillements de nuit, she had no eye but for the youth who had since grown to occupy so much of her attention. Why had it all happened just so, when it might so easily have been different? Was it that she was no better, no firmer, no more assured against the little trips and trickeries of fickle fortune than a novel heroine? Grand misfortunes and cus-  C   476         NE VER A GAIN. tomary chances and calamities, she could understand, might lie in wait in her life-path. But here was a thing, that the slightest turn of the steer. ing wheel could have prevented, and yet something had come out of it that would color her whole life. She could not under- stand it. And did she regret that the pilot had not shifted a spoke or two in time? Well, there was no use of her ask- ing herself such a silly question, and so her thoughts wan. dered off to a great secret that her father, as she thought, had confided to her. She could not say to herself exactly what it was, but it was a heavy secret, a terrible secret, one that no one else must ever know. One thing was clear; her father had told her so; to keep the world from knowing this terrible secret; to save him from utter, irredeemable ruin she tmust marry the Count. "Must marry him," sighed Helen. "Marry and not love him! Marry him when my imagination ' carries no favor in it -but--Bertram's!' And I must accept. Must accept! why everybody says there is not a girl in the city who would not jump with joy at an offer from him. What a vulgar phrase- jump for joy; andcyet is it half as vulgar as the. act? Can any words equal in meanness the act of accepting an offer of mar- riage without love?-Without love!-and Helen smiled a little smile as she thought how easily any or all of the girls could make themselves fall in love with the Count; and why not?" Her thoughts ran on in the sense of Olivia's answer to Viola: "I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, of great estate; of fresh and stainless youth; in voices well divulged; free, learned, and valiant, and in demeanor and in the shape of nature a gracious person: but I cannot love him." Helen sighed deeply, and leaned over the heavy balus- trade-her delicate hands scarce feeling the roughness of the coarsely sanded wood-work. The gloom of night was stealing over the scene; and stealing over her heart a flood of gloomy sentiment which was hardly grief, or sorrow, or deep affliction. Sad, mlelan choly, triste--either is the proper word. Apart from hei   NE VER   A GIN.        4" father's troubles why should she feel any great distress? If the apparently inevitable had presented itself in the shape of an old, ugly, disagreeable. man without money, there could be no doubt about the answer. But the truth is it takes a cer- tain number of years, and a certain knowledge of the world, before a young girl can fully understand either her sentimen- tal rights or capacities. Although not technically "a girl of the period," Helen was nevertheless a girl of modern society-her nature qualified by its laws and its trules-and with a loving and lovable but fortuneless youth on the one hand, and a young, rich, noble and agreeable suitor on the other, she could, in her innocence and ignorance, hardly com- prehend the terrible strait in which she stood. -She did not know that she had either the right or the power to feel her- self as desperately set upon by fate as any Amanda or Be- linda in the most doleful pages of fiction. "Die ist shAl," said the Count, and he placed his hand on the balustrade and leaned over by Helen's side. Helen said nothing. "Beautiful! it's more than beautiful, it is soul filling and heart satisfying." Helen made no reply. "Don't you think so, Miss Helen?--don't you think that there are special aspects of nature that sometimes give us an almost startling sentiment of universal harmony, and that serve to put us into a wonlderful intimate relation with the di- vine essence of things?" "I think," said Helen slowly without raising her head, "that the perception of harmony depends as much upon our own moods as upon the phases of nature. In some states of the mind we are awake only to the dissonances of life and society, and then it is pretty hard to feel the harmonies of nature or see the commonest outlines or elements of beauty.' "And is that your condition of mind?" Helen made no reply. "You must admit that objectively this scene is beautiful -very beautiful, and full of a deep rich sentiment of power and repose."   478        N1E VERl A GA IN. "Objectively! yes," replied Helen in a somewhat pas. sionate tone, "but subjectively"- "Well, subjectively?" demanded the Count. 'I'll tell you," exclaimed Helen, "if you want I should tlse your big scientific words; objectively I find the view fine enough, and the emotion it excites or ought to excite one of beauty; but subjectively mllixed up wnith my present feelings, I think that it is as ugly as sin. There now, you have got nmy opinion." And Helen turned again and looked down upon the river; and she half held her breath and pressed her lips together and scowled a little gentle scowl, so provoked was she with herself for letting the words slip off her tongue in such a tone of passionate petulance. The Count bent his head down gently and deferentially, and turned his face so as fully to confront hers: "And is it so, Miss Helen? Is it that some trouble has come to you? Is it, as your poet Shakespeare has it, that to your bosom has come some perilous stuff that weighs upon the heart'? Oh, I have thought so.  I have felt for some time that something has happened. I have been in this country but a few weeks, yet how much change. I found you a mirthful girl, and now you are a mournful woman. I won't ask why this is-I won't ask what it is, but I should so .much like to ask one question." "Oh, no! no I " exclaimed Helen," don't ask me any question, not just now." "I should so much like to know," persisted the Count, "if I have anything to do with your trouble. It is perhaps all presumption and impertinence on my part, but somehow it seems so." Helen's memory glanced back to her last-interview with Luther, when he had asked the same question in almost the same words. It was absurd-it was provoking, to have all the  men putting such questions, and bothering a poor girl so! "Am  I disagreeable to you?" continued the Count; " you  don't seem to say so, and yet--and yet-you treat me so   NEYVER AGAIN.          479 iconsistently: politely, kindly, I admit, but my presence eems lately to ever make you sad and troubled. Is it that ou hate me? that I give you pain? I will take myself away rom the city. from the country, and I shall have but one egret-that I ever came." Helen knew not what to say. She felt greatly relieved :t finding that the proposed question of the Count was not he one she so much dreaded, but still she was very much :mbarrassed'for an answer that should be sufficiently kindly ind yet not express too much-that should rebut his self- Iccusation, and yet not be a downright fib. Helen did not know on the instant what to say, and ;o instinctively she straightened herself up and gave him a ook--a bewildering look,--one of those looks that contain all "nds of meaning just as suits a man's capacity. There was enough of -the twilight left for the Count to Atudy that look for the space of half a second. The French sometimes say of a woman-elle a coittume de regarder les honrzes tans He blanc des yeux-and it is some- times said somewhat disparagingly, as indicating a bold, hard look. But it may be purely a bewildering look, or a fasci- nating look. It may be used furtively-a swift, sharp stroke, like a blow with a stiletto; or it may be laid on calmly and steadily like a sluice-pipe on a California gold-hill, melting away in -its steady flood everything earthy and stony in the maleformation. In either case it's a wonderfully effective social weapon, and many of the queens of society have been indebted to it for their victims. -Take Mrs. Wallace Benton, for instance: a dozen men more or less clever are gathered about her---old men and young men-business men and society men-unsophisticated men and blase fogies of forty seasons. What keeps the ani- mated, excited group around her, while belles of infinite pre- tension revolve the tedious order of society chit-chat with per- haps a single solitary satellite, and he dying to burst his orbit and dash off into the regions of infinite chicken salad and Champagne? Is it her wit, her vivacity, her quick apprecia-   480         NE VER 'A GALNV. tion of the humorous, her flattering sallies and brilliant repar. tees? or the tact with which she stimulates, yet controls with- in due bounds the intellectual struggles of her arena? Not so, although these all serve. The truth is, that each fellow in turn gets the regard, directement dans le blanc des yeux, and it goes to his very vitals. Each thinks that he alone has it, and it doubles him up like a gladiator under the " habet" of the amphitheatre. Mentally he falls at her feet exclaiming- while his self-love is oozing out at every stab, arid the sweat of tickled vanity moistens and softens the hard lines of brow and lip,-O empress, dying I salute thee. Helen gave the Count this kind of a look, but a look can. not be properly too long indulged in. To be effective it must be more or less fleeting. The regard may be pushed into a stare, or it may be prolonged into a leer. Sooner or later it is necessary to say something, and Helen was beginning to feel the want of words when her' embarrassment was happily relieved by the strident voice of Mrs. Struggles. '"Oh, Helen! your mother sends me after you. She wants you to come in; it is time to go in to tea." Helen grasped quite joyfully at the proffered relief. "Oh, thank you, Mrs. -Struggles. I am sorry you should have had the trouble of coming for me. I had quite forgotten how late it is; this scene is so beautiful, and the twilight lasts so long now,-see, it has not gone yet. Count, you are a great admirer of Wordsworth. Do vou recollect his address to twilight? It might have been occasioned, one would think, by a scene like this. It begins- 'Hail twilight! sovereign of one peaceful hour, Not dullard thou as undiscerning night, But studious only to remove from sight Day's mutable distinctions'- But I won't keep you, Mrs. Struggles. I know both you ant mamma are tired, and want your tea.  Allons donc," and Helen slipped round on the other side of the lady as thh Count extended his arm, leaving Mrs. Struggles to grasp the proffered support.   NEVER A GA IN.         481 tMrs. Struggles had seldom before had an opportunity of putting her hand on the arm of a count, and the touch electri- fied her. It lifted her on to her toes, and made her at least two inches taller. It swelled the fine proportions of her bust, craned her neck with a graceful curve, and stuck her pannier out far in advance, or rather in arrear of the sternest demandis of fashion. As she minced her way through the drawing-room across the marble hall, and down the sweep of the dinfing-room in the walke of Miss Ledgeral and the Honesdales she- held her face upturned full into the light of the Count's countenance, [ appearing to be wholly absorbed in an animated discussion, of which the virtues of the imperial Russian overland tea comn- pared with the vulgar sea-brought product of China and Japan -seemed to be the chief staple. "Oh, I am sure, Count, it must be much finer. The Emperor orders it all himself, you know, Count. An imperial ukase, I believe they call it; ,and they bring it all to him in a caravan, and he gives it round to the different courts. He must have sent it to your court in Berlin-have you never tasted it? You have? Oh charming! and the Princess Royal, -how does she like it? she can't prefer that horrid English breakfast-tea." And then Mrs. Struggles wandered, or rather wondered off with a dozen questions about the Princess, as to her age, tastes, looks, etc., and no explanations of the Count could mnake her exactly understand how a Princess Royal could get along in years, and how she could grow really stout, or how it was that her mother, Queen Victoria, or her father-in-law, King William, or her husband, the Prince. could allow her to like any tea in preference to that which comes directly from the Czar's own hands. Mrs. Struggles appeared, as we have said, to be wholly ab- sorbed in this voluble chat, but more than one acute eye noticed the furtive but wide-sweeping glance with which she made sure Mr. and Miss Somebody were awake to the fact that the Count was taking her down to tea, and that all the nobodies present were getting a realizing sense of a state of 3I   482        NE VER AGA IN. beatitude beyond their sphere. Poor Mrs. Struggles! -let us laugh at you just a little bit-you can very well stand it. You are the type of a very large class ; and ridicule, even the coarsest and strongest, becomes the feeblest badinage when frittered up among so many. Besides, you are having all that you want in this life; you are getting on in fashionable society; you see your way to the highest heaven of bon zon. Let the world wag its tongue, then! Let the poor devils sneer! Only, my dear Mrs. Struggles, if you could modify-or conceal some of the little infirmities of our common nature,-if you could suppress upon all occasions-as you so well know how to do on some--your pride and arrogance and envy and malice, and all the various modes and manners of unchari- tableness; if you could permit yourself a glimpse of the fact that there is in the world-in society-yes, even in fashion- able society, something worth thinking about besides dress and visiting and gossip; if you could realize for a moment that there are a great many worthy and respectable people who really don't consider that posturing and kotowing before the Great Pam-barn-sham is the end-all and be-all of exist- ence; if you could I say--but then you can't, what is the use of talking about it? If you could, however, don't you think that it would be an improvement? We should still sneer, to be sure, but then our sneers would of course be the sneers of pure envy and jealousy, and not so largely qualified by contempt.   CHAPTER XXVI. \ Amateur Detectives-Our Foreign Immigration-Roset, Restaurateur-A Ganme of Billiards--The Conspirators. IT was a little past noon, on the same day that Captain Combings had announced by his presence the arrival of the Spoondrift, that the passers in Broadway might have noticed two men-one young, the other of middle age-who, crossing the park diagonally, emerged from its north-western angle, and entering- the great thoroughfare, directed their course, "up town." They paused for a moment to look at the new Court House, then in the course of construction. "That is going to be a fine 'building; quite an ornament to a city that can't brag of much in the way of architecture," observed the elder. "It's going to be a monument of infinite infamy and shame," replied the younger. C How so?" "Why it's going to be, so everybody thinks, the biggest swindle the world has ever known. Do you know, our friend over there has calculated what it would have cost to build St. Peter's or Versailles on the same plan. He says that neither could have been finished for a cent less than five hundred thousand millions." We have said that the passers on Broadway might have noticed the speakers ; but probably not one person did notice them, as there was nothing about them to attract attention; unless it might be, in both, good stalwart figures, proportioned to their ages; and in the younger man a rather striking and handsome face.   484        NEVER AGAIW        . And this face, perhaps, might have been noticed by a close observer, not because it was handsome, but because it con- tributed to a noticeable inconsistency. It was too smooth, t)oo delicate, and too refined for the old battered tarpaulin tl:iiH shaded it; and for the frayed, dingy black silk hlandkerchief  that scarcely concealed the whiteness of the throat, roiii.,i which it was carelessly knotted; and forthe coarse and wur-in pea-jacket, and the faded blue checked shirt, with its bag(-, bosom stuffed with an old red bandanna. The elder man had much less of the sailor cut in his garb. Any one-acquainted only with the sailor of the stage and the novel, might have doubted whether he had seen blue water. The only indications of it in his dress were in the knot of his black necktie, and the large bows of ribbon that decorated his shoes, and in a fine and easy roll in his gait. Otherwise, a broad-brimmed Panama hat, and a long-skirted frock-coat, might as well have girded a city missionary, or a tailor on a spree. The young man put his hand into his bosom, and adjusted his red bandanna so as to expose a little more of it to view. It was faded, stained, and full of holes, but its owner seemed to regard it with looks of pride and affection. It was the gift of a friend. "Take it," said this friend; w"t will be the salt-sea sprayiest thing about you-it speaks through every hole of the briny. It is a long time since it left its home in Barcelona. It has been blown about the world on a thousand breezes, and a thousand sneezes. - See! it is as holy as the Santo Volto of St. Veronica. Come now, none of your No, no's.

I' Yes, it was Mr. Whoppers who had been assisting at the toilet of ]Luther and the Captain, and aiding and advising them as to their make-up with all the authority derived from an extensive experience, acquired when a member of an ama- teur Thespian club in Division Street. "Now Luther," exclaimed the Captain, "just look here a minute before we get fairly to work. I don't think that Mr. Whoppers fully understands the, subject. He points well, but he sags off to leeward terribly sometimes. For just see,--who are we, and where bound? We pretend to be runaway sailors, and we are up in this quarter of the city to escape observation. We are disguised sailors, and it would be absurd to flaunt our bunting like one of those stage fellows. Don't you see we are supposed to be lying to with all our top hamper sent down so as to give the enemy the go-by, and yet Mr. Whoppers wants to rig you up like Jack on a spree, with his pocket full of bank-notes, and sailing around Greenwich or Cherry streets and splicing the main brace about every fifteen minutes. Mr. Whoppers' only idea of a sailor is one of your shiver-my-tim- bers and damn-my-tarry-top-lights sort of fellows. He has made you mount that tarpaulin. I don't like it. I think we had better find a second-hand hat store, and change it for such a cap as a runaway sailor would be likely to buy for a disguise; something that would suit a Bowery boy or a butch- er's apprentice. And that baggy bosom and red handker- chief,-I don't like that either. You had better button up your jacket, and make believe you want to conceal all the m'arks of a seaman. No one seeing you now would think you had any such design. You will be taken at once for a bold sailor-boy, and all will wonder what you are up in this part of the town for. You won't make a man believe that you are skulking about here to keep out of the way of the police   486        NE VER A GA6IN. sharks. Some, perhaps, will see that you are only acting sail. or, for there is a whiff of the land breeze about you, hitch up your trowsers, and roll about as much as you please; and others will believe that you are a jolly one on a lark, and they will watch you, expecting to see you about every five minutes pull out that old handkerchief, flourish it over your head, cut a pigeon wing, and sing-       - 'Oh, I loved a gal, and her name was Hannah; Rouse her in! Rouse her in! And she played me a tune on her planner; Rouse her in! Rouse her in! Oh, I made her a present of a red bandanner; Rouse her in! Rouse her in!' I'll tel. you what, Luther, the folks we are going among are wide awake I guess. It won't do to let them get their smell- ers on us. If they do, they'll scent a rat as sure as you're alive.  I didn't want to argue the matter with Mr. Whoppers. 'Taint no use to argue with an editor, and in his own sanctum too;-you always get the worst of it. You might as well argue with a female missionary, or a preacher in his pulpit, or a  skipper on his own quarter-deck. I thought we'd just quietly make our alterations as we go along up town." The suggestions of the Captain were so unquestionably judicious, that Luther had no objections to make, and a few blocks down Canal Street, they were able to replace Luther's tarpaulin with a cap that better consorted with the idea of a sailor in disguise. It had a broad brim that could be pulled well down over the eyes. The other changes of costume were [ easily made, even to the substitution of a pair of corduroy pantaloons for the white duck trowsers, which last Mr. Whop- pers had especially ordered from a slop-shop, and which he had insisted upon Luther's getting into. The shop, narrow, dark, and dirty, seemed to be a recep- tacle for every kind of half-worn remnants of defunct or bank- rupt humanity. Hats, coats, and pantaloons, new and second- hand, a quantity of women's gear, a show-case of an infinite variety of fancy trinkets, tcys, weapons, and musical instru- A ..                -.

It was evidently one of those unlicensed and illegal loan offices, which to the disgrace of municipal govern- ment abound. The keeper of this den was a burly fellow, with no very striking characteristics. In any other place one would hardly have known for what to have taken him. A certain vulgar bonhomie he evidently had by nature, but his ac- quired manner was as clearly a compound of servility and brutality, in what the physicists call a condition of unstable equilibrium. Behind his counter he hloked eminently fitted to his position, but in Wall Street his mien and presence might have been perhaps considered equally appropriate. In that lovely street he would have been taken, or perhaps mistaken, for a gold speculator, or the latest and most as- tounding development of a railroad director. This fellow, as he handed the Captain his change, made him a comical grimace, as much as to say, "I know what you are and what you're after." The Captain returned it by a regular east-north-east wink. " You haven't seen nothing of a couple of sailors, an old one and a young one, about here have you ?" demanded the Captain. " Not a sight," replied the shopman, his leer running into a broad grin. "The only thing I seed is a couple of very nice gentlemen, in long togs--city missionaries, I guess, or travelling dry-good drummers; and I think I ought to know a sailor when I sees him. I've been before the mast one voyage myself." "Well, then, if the perlice should be inquiring round." " Oh, mum is the word. I ain't such a fou-fou as to stand round all day, with my mouth wide open, and my tongue a wagging like a terrier's tail. But I say, I hope the ship has got a good offing, by this time."    488        NE VER A GA I A. "Well, the wind is fair, and she was short apeak, with the tug alongside, all day yesterday; but I guess it's best to run a little further up town, and heave to in some of the by- streets. Wooster Street is a good holding ground ain't it?" "First-rate. It is full of foreign holes, where no one would think of looking for a Yankee." ' Oh, we are not Yankees, we are Swedes," said the Captain. "Oh ho. I see," and the speaker winked his eye, and jerked his thumb over his left shoulder!"I see; you're Swedes. Can't speak a word of English, eh ." -c Oh, no, not so bad as that," returned the Captain; " we can muster English enough to say, How are you ship-mate? won't you go round into some quiet place, in Wooster Street, and set up your backstays a little?" "Well, that's good English! No parla voo, about that. And seeing it's you, I don't care if I do, as the poet says. Here, Jem, look out for the shop. I am going out on business with these gentlemen. I shall be back in an hour." Luther looked inquiringly at the Captain. "He is a bloat, and a blab," whispered the latter; "but he's. not bad com- pany for us just now, and if we can get him up as far as Spring Street, he'll give us a first-rate introduction to your saloon. He can tell our story for us better than we can. He'll let the saloon-keeper know in five minutes that we are runaway sailors, and Swedes." "Well, come along, my hearties. I don't know your names, but you may call me Cooner-that's my name, Bill Cooner, and your name, is Bill too? Oh. Jack, ha? Well, of course it's Jack, and the youngster's name is Jem?" "My name is Luther." "Oh, Luth! Well I'll be hanged if ever I heard that name before for a sailor. But it will do for a land-lubber's hailing handle, eh?" and with a knowing leer, and his hat cocked over his left eye, in true b'hoy style, the speaker led the way around the corner into Wooster Street. There is perhaps nothing that strikes with such force the   NE EVER A GA IN.        489 eye of an old New Yorker, especially upon his return to his native city, after an absence of several years, as the astonish- ing change of names upon the signs adorning the shops and saloons. He finds that Smith and Jones, and Green and Brown and Black, and all the other good old names of Anglo-Saxon, and even Celtic origin, have been swept away; and in their place the names of Schmidt and Schwartz and Grunz, and others of the purest Teutonic sound. He hears of the vast immigration pouring on to our shores from the teeming hives of faderland ; but he pays little attention to newspaper statistics perhaps, and only wakes up to the great fact when he reads it in the big painted or gilded letters that salute his wondering eyes at every turn. Suddenly he becomes aware that we are rapidly becoming very much Ger- manized. He is a little startled at first, but in view of the enormous Celtic element he cannot find it in his heart to regret that the neutralizing influence of the German immigra- tion is so powerful. May it not, however, become too powerful? Hardly; the Anglo-Saxon stock has an immense vitality; it has a wonder- ful power of absorption and assimilation, and luckily it had taken full possession of the country, and brought over its lan- guage and literature, and overrun and subdued all things to itself years before the tide of immigration swelled to anything lilke its present proportions; and besides, the character of the immigration is growing more and more heterogeneous. There is, perhaps, a threatened proportionate decrease in the number of Irish immigrants, but the flow of other nationali- ties is rapidly increasing. The Scandinavian element is afloat, vigorous and daring as when under their Vikings they colonized the shores of Kent, or visited the far-off coasts of Vineland. There is an increasing immigration from England itself, and the current once fully established, and the stolid masses awakened to the allurements of cheap land and high wages, and yielding to the attraction of affinities of blood and language, will, in time, crowd the North Atlantic with ships. The steady influx of Hungarians, and Poles, and Ital-   "O        NEVER AGAIN. ians, and French, shows a tendency to increase in volume. All these separate nationalities have no choice but to crystal- lize in time upon the solid nucleus of English language, litera. ture and law. This gratifying heterogeneity of our immigration is nowhere better seen than in a stroll up and down the first three or four streets bisected -by Bleecker St., and it was with somewhat such speculations as the reader has been stopped to indulge in, that Luther, following his companions, read the signs of jumbled-up nationalities. They had passed two or three groggeries, but the Captain had objected to each, and had persisted in his course up the street. "You did not like that cellar because it was too pokey," exclaimed Mr. Cooner, "and you don't like this gin-shop because it's too public. Where the devil will you go? You'll dive into this lager beer saloon? Well, I'll be d-d if I will. I hate lager. You've got to drink so much of it before it does you any good. But 'll tell you what, there's a place just above here where the fellow has got some old Bourbon. I tried it one night as I was coming along here. I just dropped down into a rum-looking hole as ever you laid eyes on; such an infernal jabber of French and Dutch you never heard, and they were all drinking sour wine, and lager, and such stuff. Hollo, covey, says I, have you got any old rye? I'll be shot if the fellow knew what I meant. Have you got any Bourbon? said I. Do you know what that means  Oh, oui, oni, said he, ze Frenchmens knows ze Bourbon. Ha! ha! and I swear the fellow rumaged around and found a bottle of real ' blue grass.' I have never been there since. What do you say, shall we go there and try it?" "How far up?" demanded the Captain. "Oh, only a block or two now. You can't see it till you stand right over it almost, and then you dive right down a cellar steps as straight and cramped as a ladder to a for'k'sel. It must be somewhere in the neighborhood of Bleecker." The Captain and Luther exchanged looks. The fellow   NEVER AGAIN.          491 was, perhaps, leading them to the very den they wanted to explore. "Well, heave ahead," replied the Captain. "We'll just keep our lead agoing; Luther, you give a look astern once in a while and see that we don't overrun it." "I've got it," ejaculated Mr. Cooner, after they had pushed on for a few steps. "I think that must be it, just over there. Do you see those two billiard-cues painted red on the water-table just level with the curb-stone? Amcdee, Roset-Restaurateur Francais--Lager-bier and wein saloon- Vins Fran;ais, Mittag something or other, Salle de billiard. That must be the place; come, we'll try it anyway." "That's our place," whispered Luther, as they crossed the street. "I feel quite certain of it." The Captain gave a sweeping look around, and, with the swift conclusiveness of a sailor's glance, took in every object in view. "I hope so," he replied in a low voice. "It is nicely situated. If we can spot our men down in that hole, we can slip out and watch them from Michael O'Reilley's corner yonder. Do you see his side-window commands this en- trance? Mr. Cooner led the way;Luther and the Captain fol- lowed, and found themselves in a small room almost wholly below ground, furnished only with three or four tables and a corresponding number of chairs. Across the back of the rear ran a bar of black walnut, but destitute of all attempts at ornamentation, such as usually characterize the American institution. No glitter of cut glass and plated ware. A general jumble of black bottles, evidently more for use than show, and arranged on shelves without any regard to artistic effect, occupied the background, with the exception of a space allotted to a large square mirror whose reflective power had been very much modified by the work of some clever artist in soap. Numerous designs, and among them the E Pluribus Unum bearing bird of freedom, executed in that unctuous material, gave the surface of the glass the appearance of hI.,in hPen beautifully engraved.   "2        NEE VER A GAIN. This room communicated by a narrow arch-way with a larger room beyond. Besides the arch, a further portion of the partition had been cut away at the back of the bar, inaking an opening through which the bar-tender could see into the larger room, and pass in any liquors demanded. This large room contained two billiard-tables and awas lighted only by gas. At the upper end were a dozen round tables similar to those in the front. A door, so framed in the wood-work, however, as scarcely to attract attention, indi- cated a further room of some kind beyond. The ceilings of both rooms were so low that they could easily be reached by even a man of short stature. Evidence that more than one man's hand had reached the ceiling of the room  was furnished in numerous charcoal and red chalk sketches which adorned it. The sides of thie room were also liberally ornamented with similar artistic touches. Few of them had any merit either in design or execution, consisting mostly of scrolls and arabesques run wild, or distorted faces and figures, and attempts, and generally very poor attempts at caricature. Only one "design" really merited observation. It represented the first Napoleon dressed .up in his shroud to resemble an old cook. Napoleon the third, representing a chaerc/tier, stands behind his counter and offers a dead eagle. "Quoi/ un aigle  What! an eagle?"demands   the great, Emperor. "Autrefois, mon oncle, mais mnaitenant un beanu co de bru- ysre. Formerly, my uncle, but now a nice grouse." The uncle pulls a  handful of tail feathers, and applies them to his nose. "Pah! ue c'est mur! trop de fuamet," he exclaims.  "'Vous Pavez garde trop longtemnps. It is too high, you have kept him too long." Luther had wandered into this room, and his attention was attracted by the spirit and vigor that chax acterized the de- sign. He particularly admired the neat way in which the labels from the mouths of the speakers were interlaced, so as to'indicate the succession of the conversation. He was so occupied in studying the various mural decorations that, fav-   NE VER A GAIN.         493 ored also by the kindly oversight of the Captain, ae escaped his share in the first potations. The only occupants of the rooms besides the landlord-a short burly mongrel, half German, half French, from the neighborhood of Strasburg-and his bar-keeper and billiard- marker, a little black-haired, black-eyed, dirty-skinned speci- men of the stumpy race, to which a few generations mrore of conscription and war will reduce the whole population of France--were two men in seedy costume seated at one of the four round tables. A pack of cards was lying between them, but they were not playing, probably because playing involved paying, at least for drinks, and, to judge from their looks, it was very doubtful whether they could muster the price of a glass between them. The Captain gave them a glance, and then winked at the landlord. Generosity is ever the role of the sailor. "I say, Cooner," he exclaimed, " those fellows haven't freshened their nip yet this morning." "Well, I guess they are ready to take a new hold if they have." "Well, give 'em a chance at any rate," and the Captain L advanced toward them a step, and pulling the brim of his straw hat, scraped his foot on the sanded floor. "Parlez vous Francais, Mfounseers?" he demanded. "Oh, oui," replied one of the men. "C'est ma langue natale, mais Monsieur ici est Italien." "Well, Italian or French, it's all the same thing, since you parla voo frangcais. So, -will you join us in a horn?" "What do you say, sir?" "What do I say? Why I say parla voo francais, but per- haps I'd better try the other fellow in Italian. Parlate voi Italianno?" "Si, Signor." "Well then, will you step up here and join us in a horn? Libate, eh? per Baccho." The Captain's gestures were easily understood, hovever unintelligible his language might be. "Name your liquors, mounseers ; what shall it be?

Here's to you, mounseers; all the hair off your heads, and if you do have to scud under bare poles, may you never yaw, so as to come by the lee. Come, let us sit down. It don't cost any more, I believe-Americans are the only people that stand up to their liquor." Mr. Cooner remained at the bar, talking to the landlord, while the Captain and his new acquaintances seated them- selves at one of the tables, and were soon on the most friendly terms, clinking their glasses and exchanging compliments in a jumble of sea-talk and broken English, with scraps of French, Italian, and even Latin thrown in. "I'll tell you what, signor, we sailors ama the Italianos," he exclaimed, as the conversation grew animated, " they are devilish good fellows,-boing fellores,-comprenez vous? And they are good sailors, only it takes such a bloody lot of 'em to do any work. Why, I've seen twenty-five fellows making sail on a felucca of thirty tons; but they are devilish bono fel- lores, if it does take a good many of them to make a crew. And we owe 'em molto grazzos. There's Columbus, vous savez. Ah! molto grande homo; no greater skipper ever walked a quarter-deck. Why, I'll be d-d if senze questo grande Capitano we should not have been all cussed Indians here to this day. Comprenez vous, signor? malditos Indi- anos! Let us boirez a la sante of il grande Skipperano.-" A general clinking of glasses followed this invitation. "Do you know, mounseers," continued the Captain, "we get a good deal of our lingo from the Italians. Why, you can hardly give an order on ship-board without talking Italian. You know, mounseers, what starboard and larboard means?" "Oh, oui, oui. Starboard d droite, so ; larboard dgauch6e so." Ah! I see, you savez. Well, where the devil do you suppose those words come from? Look here now, ecoutez, as we say in France; questa borda! good Italian ain't it, sig- nor? I thought so ; and what does it mean? translate it into English, si'l vous plaitp."   NE VER A GAIN.         495 Questo borda, this side," replied the Italian. "Good, signor, I knew you'd guess it, you've hit it exactly, you've got it as straight as a purser's log-devil the figure on either side more or less. Well, don't you see now, questa botda--sta borda-starboard. There you have it-every time a fellow says starboard your helm, or hard a starboard, he talks just as good Italian as the king of Italy. And now for a pull on your larboard braces. Quella borda, what is that?" "Quello borda, this side." "Qucllo or quella, just as you please. I wouldn't give a pig's grunt between -an oh! and an ah! It's all bono Itali- ano? I thought so. Well, uella borda-la borda-larboard. You capisco that-you do '? Well, you'd be a d-d fool if you didn't. It's as plain as a kink in a pig's tail. Here's to you, gents, all, and may you never want a drop or two of water to season your grog with." This last salutation was addressed to two or three new- comers, who, although tolerably well clad, and evidently be- longing to a very different order of society, had all that shrunken and not-well-to-do-look so characteristic of a certain class of foreigners, especially those who frequent restaurants like that of Mr. Roset. "See here, Rosy," shouted the Captain to the landlord. "Do you see these ere gentlemen, with nothing in their fists to hold on by ; and you've got liquor enough there to float a line-of battle ship? Come, bail it out here now; bail it out. It's my treat, gents. You won't refuse to lend a helping hand to a sailor in distress, will you? I've got to clean that fellow's bar out. The revenue folks sent me here. They said, "Jack, you can't sail to-day; you must'go up andt drink that Rosy fellow as dry as a pampero. So lend a hand, and don't cut up proud; you may be Dukes and Counts, and I don't doubt you are, but that's no reason why you should spring your luff at the first hail. Come, what shall it be?" At the order for unlimited liquors, Mr. Roset turned to Mr. Cooner. He knew nothing of Cooner. Perhaps if he   "6        NEVER AGAIN. had, he would not have turned to him. "He's old friend of yers. Eh! you know him var well?" "Know him," replied Cooner, "I know him all to pieces  Why, I'd know his hide in a tanyard. He's an old messmate of mine, used to sail in the same ship; saved his life once. I'll tell you how it was. You see, it was blowing like the devil-clark as Egypt; a gust came along and took the Cap- tain's hat off. 'Jack,' said he, 'jump overboard and pick my hat up.' So overboard Jack went. 'My Heavens,' said I, 'Captain, he can't swim a stroke.' 'Can't he?' said he; 'well, jump overboard and help him;' so overboard I went. I caught him by the hair of his head, just as he was going down for the third and last time. Well, at that minute the hurricane blew its d-dest, and the ship flew off to ieeward so that I couldn't get aboard. The captain threw us an old hen- coop, and with that I kept Jack up all night, and the next morning we met a vessel bound for Liverpool, and she picked us up and took us in." Was Mr. Cooner lying? Hardly; he was like a many post-prandial story-tellers, in good society, merely indulg- ing his imagination. When a gentleman like Mr. Dingly or Mr. Budds finds himself at the mercy of an o'ermastering imagination, it is admitted to be wrong, very wrong, for his club friends and companions to call him the biggest liar in town. Why should not, then, a poor blackguard like Cooner have a similar mantle of charity thrown over his comparatively moderate exercise of the romancing faculty? "Zay, got money?" demanded the landlord. "Oh, you bet," was the answer. "They can pay for all the liquor you can pour into them. They have got their advance in their pockets. They just want to keep shady for a day or two; and I don't believe there is any money to be made by blowing on 'em. I brought 'em in here on account of that old Bourbon. I'll take another small horn, and then I must clear out. Got something to look after at home, but I'll come in and try it again some time. You can chalk it all in the bill, you know;" and Cooner winked and put his thumb to his nose.   NEVER AGAIN.          497 "Oh, je twig, je twig. Very happy to see you any time, every time," exclaimed Mr. Roset. "I sall take care for your friends. If somebody comes for them, nobody sail find 'em in dis place." "Good-bye, shipmate," exclaimed Mr. Cooner, shaking hands with the Captain. "I'll see you again. I'll drop in this afternoon. I guess you can't do better than stay here. First-rate place to lay low in. Mr. Roset he'll make you comfortable; give you a bed up-stairs, and something to eat. You can keep shady for a week here if you choose." "Yes, sar, everything dat's convenable is here at your service," interposed Mr. Roset. "Much obliged," replied the Captain. "I'm sure I'm satisfied; this is a first-rate place to wood and water in- good holding-ground; liquor good, and enough of it to float a fellow safely,-I guess I'll come to an anchor here, but I'm not going to bitt too short. I'll give her a smart scope. You see we must have a little .room to swing to moorings. Can't stick down here all the time. The youngster 'll get tired; so we'll just float around a little in this neighborhood, and heave short whenever we want to take in a little more ballast. You'll find us here this evening." Luther was knocking about the billiard-balls in the other room. Mr. Cooner went in to bid him good-bye, and availed himself of the opening at the back of the bar, to try another small glass of Bourbon. Coming out into the front room, the Captain proposed one more drink. To this Mr. Cooner at first demurred, but suddenly recollecting himself, he pulled out his watch. "Well," he exclaimed, "it is just eleven o'clock. I don't care if I do. I always take a drink exactly at eleven o'clock. I don't think an eleven o'clocker hurts any fellow, if he's only regular." "That's right, my hearty," responded the Captain, giving Mr. Cooner a friendly slap on the back. "Nothing like regu- lar drinks for a man's constitution, especially if he minds his dunnage. I don't like this drinking on an empty stomach. If you want to carry your liquor easy on a long voyage, you 32   "8        NE VER AGAIN. must put down something for it to lie on. This drinking before breakfast is like stowing a cargo of railroad -iron on to your kelson; sooner or later it will snap your sticks out of you. But eat a good hearty breakfast, and then drink regular -say every half hour, and swamp my gig if you can't stand it forever." Mr. Cooner swallowed his fourth glass, and after renewed hand-shakings, started for his den in Canal Street, to bully and brow-beat, perchance, some poor devil of a mechanic out of work, or some miserable wretch of a seamstress, while making him or her a loan at two hundred per cent.   ) A game of billiards was proposed by the bar-keeper, between himself and Luther, and the Captain and his compan- ions moved, with their glasses, in to the back saloon to watch the play. The gas, turned on in full force, flared and flick- ered under two dingy tin shades attached to the low ceiling, lighting up the bed of a shabby table. The cloth, worn here  and there quite threadbare, and even patched in places, had nearly lost, under the influence of time, chalk, dust, and the constant friction of dirty hands, its original color, and assumed what might be described as either a filthy yellowish gray, or a dirty whitish brown. A slight, but suspicious want of level, indicated by the balls hugging the cushion on one side, and exhibiting a decided inclination to one corner pocket, would at once have led a strange expert to the idea that perhaps the mal-adjustment was allowed in the hopes that an exact knowl- edge of the run of the balls might occasionally give a decided advantage to Monsieur Roset or his markers, over their igno- ant opponents. Luther had played hardly a dozen games in his life, but, for one of his limited experience, he was unusu- ally expert. He knew at least enough of the game to suspect at the first stroke or two, made with affected awkardness, that his opponent was a strong hand. "We shall bet a little something. One dollar, two dollar, eh?" denanded the fellow. Luther demurred. "I don't know anything about billiards or betting. You are much stronger than I. You can give me seventy-five in a hundred."   NE, VER AGAIN.         499 "No, sar. I know nothing. I play just two, three games in all my life. Everybody beat me; but if you want, I give you twenty points; 'tis too much, but I give you twenty points, and we play three games for five dollar." "Nothing of the kind, Mr. Velvet Jacket," interposed Cap- tain Combings, swaggering up to the table. "I don't allow this youngster to bet. He's nothing but a sucking sailor yet, and I ain't going to have any land-sharks get hold of him. Besides, he ain't got any money. I carry the swag. Look-a- here, do you see that?" and the Captain slapped a large roll of bills down on the table. "I'll tell you what-I'll play you; but it's dry work playing for money, and no fun in it. I'll play you for -Champagne for all hands. Let me see," and the Cap- tain counted up the company, which had received several accessions from the outside. "Ten in all, and more coming," he exclaimed, as two men entered and took their places at one of the round tables. "Bring on a basket of your fizzling stuff. Gentlemen, you must all liquor-up at the expense of Velvy or myself. We are going to see who's got to foot the bill." Luther, thus relieved, quietly returned to one corner, where, unobserved himself, he could watch the game and at the same time study the faces of the company, and especially notice any new-comers. His attention was particularly at- tracted by the two who had just entered. One was a small, compact, good-looking man, with something of the air of a gentleman about him. The face seemed to Luther's eye to have a familiar look. He thought of Mr. Planly's visitor, and his heart began to beat. But this man had no whiskers or mustache, and upon further examination he seemed to be a much younger man. His companion, a large, powerfully- built man, was also closely shaven, and kept his slouched hat -drawn down well over his face. Luther dared not look too attentively at them, but he was able to satisfy himself that the big man had a skin that bore - no evidences of the small pox. That settled the question. The face he was in search of was deeply pitted, and that was the only certain thing he knew about it.   500        N3NEVER A GAIN. He tried to catch their voices, but, although he sat quite near them, not a word reached his ear; in fact, as he noticed, they scarcely exchanged a syllable. The small man quietly accepted his glass of Champagne, and the big one, pulling his bruleg-oteule from his pocket, proceeded to fill it and smoke in silence. The noisy antics of the Captain attracted the general atten- tion of the company, as, amid much laughter and loud com- ments in various languages, the game went on. Luther was not only amused but astonished. He could hardly believe that the talkative, swearing, swaggering sailor could be his old dignified and gentlemanly friend, Captain Combings, and the thought occurred to him that perhaps the Captain was get- ting, as he himself would have expressed it, a little too much by the head. He would have been quite convinced of it if he had not received an assuring wink now and then, and had not noticed that the Captain took every opportunity to flirt under the table the largest-sized heel-taps. Luther was also amused by the evident skill with which the Captain's opponent succeeded in preventing his score ever running more than two or three points ahead, and his funny affectation of rage when an adroit miss gave the Captain the first game, as well as by the Captain's equally funny affecta- tion of triumphant glee when some lucky scratch rewarded an unusually bungling effort. It was a fair match, although to most of the company it looked so wholly one-sided. Both were acting. Luther alone knew that the Captain was the deepest player. How often is it so in all the affairs of life, particularly in the' affairs of love? Deceiver and deceived! and out gush the sympathies of the lookers on, when, perhaps, both have been equally playing a part, and the latter, perhaps, the deepest role of the two. In the midst of his noisy demonstrations of triumph, the Captain found an opportunity of giving Luther a sharp, swrift glance, which said as plainly as words could say-"Do you see any indications?" Luther shook his head hesitatingly, and glanced in turn at   NE VER A GMr.         501 the couple we have noticed, who still occupied their table in silence, quietly sipping their Champagne and watching, but without any marks of interest, the progress of the game. Luther conjectured that they had an appointment with some one, and were awaiting his arrival. Again the noisy game came to an end, but this time the marker -gained the victory by ten points. This result the Captain demonstrated to the company was due entirely to the scratches of his opponent and his own bad luck. "Why just look, all you parlez voos,-just look-a-here now. Don't you see the deep red was just there; my ball was just here; and there was the light red. Well, says I to myself, I'll try that bloody red on the port tack, and fly-doozle off into that infernal pale fellow. It was just as simple a thing as a dose of salts. Nothing could be plainer-it was as plain as a cap- stan-bar, or a belaying-pin in the hand of a knock-me-down mate. I just took my ball-so,-a little under the counter; but I suppose I must have given her a cant to starboard, for d--n me if she didn't go down, pitch in on the wrong side, scoot off to the lower bank, come up and catch the bloody red again just as he was getting his port tacks aboard. She gave him a regular stern-lifter, knocked him kersmash into the pale fellow, and all squiggled' into moorings on the same tide just here in this corner. Now, mounseers, perhaps you can't all of you uncoil the English as nicely, fake after fake, as you can your own lingo, but you can understand this much -that any lubber who don't know the difference between a squillgee and a marling-spike can drive a pair of grains into a shoal of rudder fish, and that's the way Velvy gets the game. All he had to do was just to smash in his ball here- he must hit something. Don't you see it was mere luck? A kind of knock-my-neighbor affair. If you don't hit Jack, you can kick Bill, and get some enjoyment out of the muss. Don't you think so, mounseers?  "Vero," politely replied an Italian in the crowd. "Veer her? I don't care two straws whether you veer or haul on that line. It's a solid fact, and you can't swing her head off a single pint." 5  *           \   no        X^YKJC] HCrAyY.           The third game was commenced.  "Moor your ball, Velvy; anywhere you please. I don't ; care. You can't get out of my way. I'm coming down on a . fuilll flood, and you may be devilish sure I'll fetch up athwart li 1 your hawse somehow."      ' The Captain looked up after making his shot, glanced at i 1 Luther, and saw: himl staring with all his eyes at a uilan who at  this moment showed himself in the doorwav. The new-comer was of mediumln height, but with something  colossal in his physical make up, that at once impressed the  beholder with the idea of enormous muscular strength and  vigor. From a deep chest and immensely wide shoulders ,  rose a bull neck, and this was surmounted by a large head  covered with a thick matting of black, curly hair. The face  was more than half concealed by beard and mustache of the  same color, but what could be seen of it was deeply marked ] with pits of the small-pox. Small, but piercing eyes gleamed  from beneath shaggy eyebrows, and gave an expression of  acuteness, combined with ferocity, to a countenance which  otherwise might have been noted only for its simple ugliness a c As the man paused for a moment in the doorway, Luther i ] had time to recover his composure of external manner, but his  heart beat violently, as he distinctly recognized the face that 1  he had seen peeringinto the attic window of Madame Steignitz' R 1 room.  And now a reaction of feeling assisted him in recovering i  entire command of himself. Here under his eyes was the man beyond a doubt, and Luther resolved that he would never  let him up, until he had tracked him to his most secret lair.  But what if he had had nothing to do with the disappearance  of the old woman? What if she had gone off herself, as the police believed? For the moment, Luther did not feel quite so  sure of his conclusions, and yet it was certain that Mr. Planly took the same view of the. case and had even furnished the i most incontestable proof that an enlevement had been contem- plated.                          ( Luther drew his cap down over his eyes, and threw him- ----II^^MM.   self half reclining into the furthest corner of the settee, upon which he had been lounging. This brought his head in close contact with the wooden partition that separated the back area from the billiard-room, and further away from the table at which were seated in silence the two men whose voices he had been so anxious to overhear, but it enabled him to keep a furtive watch upon the movements of the .new-comer, who, for some moments, seemed undecided whether to enter the room or not. He hesitated, peered round the room, through the thick haze of smoke emitted by a dozen cigarettes, spoke to some one near him, as if demanding an explanation of the scene, and only at last in obedience to a beckoning gesture, advanced across the room. ': You're late, Brochu," exclaimed the smallest of the two. "The Doctor here has been getting impatient, but I thought I would say nothing about our affair until you came. He is willing to help us if he likes the job, and anyway he will keep our counsel." Luther was too far off to catch all the words, but the tone of voice in which they were uttered sent a thrill through every pulse of his frame. The man addressed as Brochu     made no reply, but motioned towards the door in the partition; at the same time giving an inquiring glance at the young man who was reclining on the settee with his cap drawn over his face, in a pretended sleep. " Oh, nothing to fear," remarked the small man, as, in obedience to the new-comer's gesture, the two rose from their seat and moved to the table indicated. "Nothing to fear; they are runaway sailors." "Yankees ?" "Yes, without doubt." "And this youngster ? I will just take a look at his face." " No, no, don't disturb him; he is drunk, I think, and his companion there is a quarrelsome fellow; there is no use getting into a row."   504        NEVER A GAIN. All this was uttered in French, and in a low tone, but Luther's ear caught nearly every word of it. He expected each moment to have his cap snatched away, and to stand face to face with the man whose eyes had, perhaps, more than once watched him while seated in the room of Madame Steignitz. Luckily the Captain swaggered up just in time, with a bottle of Champagne in his hand. "Come, mounseer, you must boirez or beuvez, or whatever you call it, as well as the rest. No skulking allowed; fill up, fill up all around. Here's to you, mounseer, here's to your sante. May you never be taken aback by the winds of adversity-may you never founder in the seas of distress. May you always keep way with fortune. May you get the weather-gauge of old Time, and jam him hard down into the nineties, and may you go to Heaven at last, with everything drawing, from courses to royals, and a fresh gospel breeze right over your taffrail." The action and words of the Captain seemed to remove any feeling of suspicion, and the man thus addressed quietly took his glass of Champagne, replied to the Captain's sentiment with a nod, and turned back to his companions. The game of billiards was resumed with vigor-the three men looking on in silence for a few minutes, and then quietly stepping out of the door that opened into the passage way between the kitchen and the small room into which the enclosed area had been divided. Luther started, and looked after them, but the door closed and he could see nothing. The next moment he knew, fron the sound of feet and voices, that they had entered the smal room, and had taken seats at a table separated only by a thir curtained window from the large room, and within a foot o two of the end of the settee upon which he had been lying in fact by shifting his position to the other end of the settee he could bring his ear to within three or four inches of th cracked panes, and by throwing back his head as far into th corner as possible he could see by the edge of the curtain   NEVER AGAIN.          505 and catch a glimpse of the table around which they were seated. He could hear but imperfectly amid the noisy conversation going on at the lower end of the large room, but occasionally sentences, especially when the voices on the other side of the window were raised a little, came to his ear quite distinctly. Familiar as he had become with the French, there were every now and then phrases that he could hardly understand, mixed up, as they were, with argot and slang. For some of these he needed a translation almost as much as the reader. The allusions, not in all cases so obscure, it is unnecessary to explain. A silence of a few moments ensued after placing them- selves at the table. The small man, addressed by his com- panions as Monsieur Ricord, amused himself by drumming with his fingers and humming an air from Massaniello, while the one called the Doctor, and Brochu, the last comer, pulled away vigorously in silence at their pipes of gates culottees. "Ainsi," at length exclaimed Brochu, "le camite a encore une fois vmanque son caup. Le brigand est iwzulerable. So the committee has again missed its blow. The brigand is invul- nerable." Mr. Ricord stopped his drumming with a loud tap upon the table. "Mais, auzssi," he exclaimed, "pourquoi diable s'acharnent ils toujours d viser cette carcasse cuirassbe? Ze gredin est pourri; i mourra bieztlot de sa belle mort. C'est le petit zu'ilfaut escof- fier. But why do they always aim at that armored carcass. The scoundrel is rotten, and he will soon die of himself It is the little one that we ought to squelch." "C'est ce fuefaj'i toujours dit," replied the Doctor. "Ifaut avant tout exterminer la coulee. 7es obareds et les Chauvains n'nazraient plus, de point d'apuzi. Ah, si jamais je remets ley pikeds en France, nom daun-- " "Fiche moi l'ezpire," interposed Brochu, in a gruff and im- patient voice, " avec tes bravades, tu n'en as done pas encore eu assez de Cayenne."   506         NEVER AGAIN. "Tonnerre! ne me rappelle pas pa"-and the rest of the Doctor's exclamation was lost in the noise of the room, but he could hear Mr. Ricord exclaim: "Allons, allons! Calme toi; bois plutot au succes d'une nouzvelle tentative-- etj'ypense. I will soon have in my hands the means of striking a blow! We shall see--we shall see! Your revenge will come in good time, Doctor. If it don't you may call me e plus grand blagu. eur que la terre aitporte." "Bah! you have said so this year past. Tu nous ember. lucoques avec tes contes bleus."  "Tiens, tiens; The Doctor has a right to be a little impa.. tient," interrupted Brochu. "If you had had your mistress shot down by your side in that fusilade on the Boulevard Poissonniere you would be impatient too, until you see the chief murderer get his deserts. But the coup d'etat is not our subject just now. We have another coup-something nearer home, Doctor, and we want your help: Ily a unfameux coup qui mettra des jaunets dans nos goussels, s'il reussit." "Ah voilia! s'il reussit," exclaimed the Doctor, " if it suc- ceeds. Mais en quoi consiste-t-il?" En ceci; ecoutez moi bien." The speakers now bent over the table, their heads coming so closely together, and their voices subdued to so low a tone, that Luther could only catch now and then a word or two. But every word he did hear fell upon an ear strained to the utmost, and was interpreted by an imagination that flashed a blaze of light upon what would to an ordinary listener have been the most enigmatical expressions. Unepayse qui a amasse des ecus, could mean only Madame Steignitz. This was rendered certain, when the same voice spoke of la quellelpaysecelle qui se donne pour une pauvre souf- freleuse pour mieux tromper le monde et depister les ivoeurs. Who but Madame Steignitz had money, and pretended to be a poor old miserable woman? But, as if to settle the ques- tion, there came to his ear the words, une miserable nzma sarde dans Wooster Street. That described her lodging exactly-a miserable mansard /   N EV3ERY AGAIN.        507 A long consultation now took place, in a very low tone, and again Luther caught a phrase or two, of which he could find a meaning-a meaning that fairly made his hair stand on end. "Obstinate old devil!-have tried flogging!- afraid I'd kill her!-starvation no use!-no water for three days!- thought she'd die!-won't eat now a mouthful!--very sick! --can't speak!"And again followed a long conversation, of which not a word could be heard, and which was again suc- ceeded by a few phrases blurted out in a louder tone. "You must help us, Doctor. Vous m'avouerez qu'il serail du dernier ridicule de laisser une vielle migure echapper de nos mains sans payer SOn layer. If she dies, we have the credit, but none of the profit ,of murder. I don't mind that. I don't think it any harm to put such a miserable devil out of the way, but I don't wan't to make a fool of myself, faire uone sottise pour riZnh, any more than our friend Ricord here. You must contrive some way, Doctor, to keep her alive until she disgorges." "Soyez tranquile," replied the Doctor in a low tone suffi- ciently loud for Luther to follow the whole phrase. "Be easy. NoVus la farcerons a degorger. Mais apres? "Apras.! vous connaissez He Hz2uson? You know the Hudson, don't you? Well, it has covered heavier business than this, but we won't talk of that just now. Une fois en possession du magol, nous aurons du pain sur la p2anche. We will have bread for a while, my dear Doctor, and we can wait the completion of our friend Ricord's infernal gun. C'est a dire si nos cocotes ne sont pas trop dpre a la acuree." Luther had heard enough. He began to be apprehensive that the conference might break up, and the speakers sud- denly leave the house without his being able to follow them unobserved. It would be better for him and the Captain to leave first and watch from the outside. The game of billiards had come to an end. The Captain admitted himself beaten, by his own bad luck, mainly. "Although I kind of suspect, Velvy, that you can weather on me anyway; however, some other time, I'll try you again. I   508        NEVE R AGAIN. say, Rummy, what is the damage? Forty dollars, eh? Well cider and turnip juice has riz, I guess. But d-n the odds, if they only put in the fiz strong and hearty. Here's the money. What is it, youngster?" whispered the Captain. "Let us get into the street as soon as possible," replied Luther in a low tone, but with a voice that sounded strange and husky to his own ear. "I understand," replied the Captain. "I knew him the moment I put my eye on him. Go on, I'll follow in a minute, Here, Rummy, count your. rags. Good, ain't they? Oh never mind the change now,-pay me when I come back. I am just going to box about here a little-get some fresh air, and see the lay of the land. I'll be in again soon," and with a profusion of swaggering salutations the Captain followed Luther into the street. "Hold on, youngster. I ain't quite so steady on my pins. My head is clear enough, but that confounded stuff has got down into my ankles and loosened the joints. But what is the matter? You look as if you had been keel-hauled, or had been down in the fore peak with Bill Hutching's ghost. You've seen em? I was sure of it." "Seen them and heard them too," replied Luther. "But come around the corner here; we must not lose sight of that door. The murderous villains are all in there now. They have the old woman secreted somewhere, and we must track them when they come out." "Well, let us go in here. Mr. O'Reilley has got a side window there that we can look out of. We've got to "sample" some of his imported liquor, I suppose;" said the Captain, looking up and reading the sign. "Imported from a Brooklyn distillery, I guess. Confound it, I don't want to drink any more, but I suppose I must. I can't say with Cassio, that I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking; but still I've had enough. Mr. Michael O'Reilley's "sample-room" happened to be remarkably quiet. The crew of. thieves, bruisers and black- guards in general that mostly constituted the custom of the   NE VER AGAIN.         509 place were all " on the prowl," and only a few old " soakers" of no account, and too infirm for active predatory exertions, were dozing away the time and waiting the advent of some successful junior for a treat.  The two chairs by the side window looking into the street were vacant, and Luther and the Captain made their way down the length of the room, and seated themselves so as to put the entrance to Monsieur Roset's saloon directly in view. ' Now, Luther," said the Captain, " keep your weather eye open, and go on with your story. I'll order two whiskey-skins. That means a couple of glasses of alcohol, with a drop of creosote in each. It is no more hot Scotch than it's Holland gin or Nantes brandy, but it's better than their other liquors, because it has not so much fusil oil in it, and it won't lay a fel- low out cold so quick." The hot Scotch was brought. It recommended itself to Luther's palate, as it was well sweetened; and besides, his nerves had received such a shaking that a little stimulus was almost necessary to steady them, and enable him to quietly relate all that he had seen and heard. As may be imagined, not for an instant did either Luther or the Captain fail to keep an eye upon the door of Mr. Roset's saloon. People came and went, but no sign for a long time of either of the three conspirators. It began to grow late in the afternoon. An hour later and it would be too dark, perhaps, to recognize their persons ; at least from so great a distance as the side window of Mr. O'Reilley's "sample-room." Might it not be that there was some back-way by which they had made their exit? No, there they were at last-all three of them. Luther and the Captain jumped to their feet, and pre- pared to follow them, keeping as much out of sight and as far in the distance as possible. A few blocks and the three men turned a corner and were out of sight. Lutfie r and the Captain hurried their steps, and were just in time to see them turning the next   51         NEVER AGAIN. corner of the block and then the next, so as to bring then again into Wooster Street. Increasing their pace, the pursuers caught a glimpse of Mons. Brochu ascending the steps of one of a row of old fashioned, dilapidated houses, while his companions sauntered on for some distance, turned deliberately, walked back to the same house, mounted the steps and entered without pausing, the door seeming to open of itself. "It beats the forty thieves," was the Captain's comment. "I wonder if open sesame is the word." Luther and the Captain took a good view of the house from one corner. Then went round the block and took a good view from the other corner. It grew darker, and they decided that there could be no harm in strolling past the door. The house was one of six-all occupied except one, the last of the row, upon which there was a bill. The Captain stepped up to a man picking over a pile of rotten cabbage belonging to the corner grocery-evidently a German. In fact he could hardly be anything else but a German, for it is a curious truth, and one well worthy the careful consideration of the Ethnographical Society, that the German has almost entirely superseded the Irishman in the corner-grocery business. Time was when the Celtic element was supreme; when every corner was surrendered to the busy brogue of Milesian enterprise and activity; when the angles of every block were smoothed off, and filled in with rounds of inviting corned beef, and piles of ap- pealing potatoes; when the association of ideas in the case of the Green Isle and green groceries was supposed to have its foundation deep down in the essence of universal hu- manity-in the very ultimate and absolute nature of things. But now all is changed. The Teuton has come. He squats by the Celt, and the latter can no more bear the contact than the Indian can the touch of the Anglo-Saxon. He finds himself undersold, out-worked, used up, and driven out from his corner in a shower of sausages and sauerkraut and lager,   NE VER AGAIN.         5" with nothing but his bottle of whiskey to protect him from the peltings of the pitiless storm. Henceforth he must seek other fields of labor. The corner grocery is as irrevocably a German conquest as Strasburg or Metz. "Do you know anything about what rent they ask for that vacant house?" demanded the Captain. "Vacant house! nein, nein, there bees not some vacant house there this time. Maybe ten days go by there bees one. " "Why there is a bill upon one of them." "Bill! There is? Well, I it not seen him. I tink he put has been on to-day." "Well, the house that was to rent a few days ago. Who has taken that?" "Ich weiss nicht. I not know. I not seen have some- body to go in or to come out. All I say, they don't buy much at this shop." Not a doubt remained. That was the house, but nothing was to be gained by standing looking at the outside of it, especially as it was getting dark, and inasmuch as it would take at least half an hour to change their clothes and to get themselves in trim for Miss Jones' dinner-table. l*   CHAPTER   XXVII. What can be done?-The Captain's proposition-The question of Arms -The amenities of Journalism. T was with a good deal of reluctance that both Luther and 1 the Captain turned back into Bleecker Street They would have liked to enter the house by main force,-it was probably the only way they could have entered it,--and then and there make a thorough search for what they firmly believed to be concealed in it-the old w'oman. But it was too evident that the effort would be the sheerest folly, and in the end defeat the object they had at heart. A premature alarm was, above all things, to be avoided. They had succeeded beyond all expectation in tracing so soon the villains to their hiding- place. Any further efforts must be decided upon in council with Mr. Whoppers and Mr. Boggs, who, as we have seen, were to meet them and hear their report that evening in the Editor's room.              i The reader may think that it must have been a very easy and simple thing to decide upon the next movements in the game. Rush off at once to some Judge, Justice, the Chief of Police, or some officer or other, and get a warrant or order or some other kind of document, and give it to some policeman, or detective, or constable, or some myrmidon of justice or other, and go and make those fellows give up the old woman at once. Not quite so easy. Luther had had something to do with the police in the matter already, and he had not been at all satisfied with the result. The fact is, as Mr. Whoppers suggested, the detective   NE VE R  GAIN.         5I3 system has got to be-we won't say corrupt-that perhaps would be doing great injustice to many very worthy men,-but such a money-making system, that, without being able to man- age the ropes and grease the wheels, it was difficult to set the ,machinery a going, or to make it work with any rapidity or certainty when started. Besides, the system, even when doing its best, did not happen at that time to be in the enjoyment of the highest public favor. There had recently been a horrible murder-a man struck down at night in his own house on one of the most public thoroughfares, and although immense rewards had been offered for the detection of the criminal not the slighest clue had been discovered. An unusual number of dead bodies had been found floating in the Hudson and East rivers, but in no case had the police taken any effective steps to unravel the mystery. The public, without going quite so far, perhaps, as a venerable and distinguished member of the bar and of society, who maintains that the murders in New York average at least one in every twenty-four hours, had begun to believe that a large proportion of the worst crimes the police were either disinclined or unable to prevent or detect. And Luther had in this case very little to go upon. If he entered a complaint, or applied for a search-warrant or order of arrest, he had really so little to show, except his own sus- picions, that it was evident, when his statements were reduced to the dry and formal language of a legal declaration or affidavit, the police would make no move until they had sup- plemented his complaint 'by their own perquisitions and investigations. This would take time, and besides there would be the risk of alarming the conspirators, while the life of Madame Steignitz, supposing her to be living and in their power, might be instantly sacrificed in their efforts to conceal the crime. What then could be done? The Captain made a characteristic proposition. "We want to get into that house, and see if we can find the old woman. If we find her there we are all right, no   514        NEVER AGAI4At. matter how we get in. If we don't find her we shall be a wrong. But we have good motives to plead, and they wor be too hard upon us. And it often happens that in this li you have to take some risk. When the rocks are right undl your lee, in a heavy gale, what can you do? You haven room to ware, and you know devilish well that if you try 1 tack ship, you will miss stays. Well, there is nothing to d but to clubhaul her; but I tell you what, it is ticklish Lius ness-just touch and go. If you don't chop your cable at tl- right instant, and pay her head off on t'other tack, you're dow upon the rocks in no time, with masts overboard, bulwark carried away, and with your keel; kelson, garboard streak and futtocks ground out of you in about five minutes. Yo have to take risks sometimes; you can't help it. Now sup pose that I pick up half-a-dozen of the Spoondrift's crew. know where to find 'em. All I have to do is to go 'down t Joe Jigger's dance-house, and there I can put my hand upo any one of 'em; they havn't had time to spend all thei money yet, and get kicked out. Well, we will take and sav off about six or eight feet from the butt end of a spare toF gallantmast-lash a hand-rope along on either side, so tha half-a-dozen men can pick it up and swing it easily. We'] put this on a cart and drive up to the house. The men mwil come along at the same instant; each one will jump an( seize his lanyard, and all rush up the steps with the battering ram; heave with a will my hearties! one, two, bang! a singl blow, and in goes the door smashed all to flinders. We fol low pell-mell, and spread ourselves all over the house. If we find the old woman, well and good; if we don't, why we have committed flat burglary, that's all. But I don't thinl they call make a yard-arm  business of it. They can't d( more than tie us up to the gratings, and I shouldn't wonder if, considering circumstances, and character, and all that, the) would let us off with a little moderate colting of some kind The only thing is I don't see the use of more than one of us being concerned, and so if it suits you I will take the whole matter on my shoulders."   E VE ER AGAIN.         515 The Captain's proposition was received with thanks and compliments upon its boldness, its ingenuity, and generosity. "Charming!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "Splendid! in fact, considering that first smash, it would be really adorable; but you mustn't forget how soon a-crowd is collected in New York. We shouldn't have time to look through the first-floor rooms, supposing that we met with no opposition inside,-and we may well calculate upon that,-before you have the house filled with ruffians and loafers of every class, and in five min- utes you might have cases of robbery, homicide and arson added to your indictment for forcible entry and illegal search and seizure." Mr. Boggs had been sitting for some time seemingly wholly occupied in stroking his long goatee, which graceful amusement was sometimes varied by an effort to bend down, and catch in his teeth, the ends of his mustache. Mr. Whoppers turned to him appealingly. Mr. Boggs took a final vicious bite at the ends of his mus- 4 tache, and roused himself from his fit of mental abstraction, or rather perhaps it would be more correct to say, of mental concentration. "It won't do; but I have a, plan that will, he exclaimed. There is a vacant house in the row. No one knows me, and no one will suspect me. I will go to-morrow and hire that house. I suppose they will rent it by the month. The owner or agent will jump to the conclusion that I take it for some female friend. It is well known that there is more than one fellow in our club who is interested in private lodgings in out-of-the-way streets. I'll let him think so. Well, don't you see, once in possession of the house, we can operate from it in precisely the same way as we suppose Monsieur Brochu and his friends to have done in the case of Madame Steignitz. We can enter their house at night, over the roof, through the dormer window, and perhaps be able to carry her off in the same way." "Good!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "I like that; it is upon the principle of a hair of the dog, etc. It's strictly according to the lex talionis, and it's scriptural too; 'an eye   516   '      NEVE R AGA H.. for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth ;' an old woman for an old woman; enlavement pour enld'svement, as she would say in her own language." "But I don't see how we can get over the roofs without alarming the inmates of the intervening houses," said Luther. "Oh, pooh! There is no difficulty about that; it's just a case of ' Still so gently o'er me stealing.' We can step noise- less as the foot of Time, when he only treads on flowers. We won't creep along the eaves, and affront the dormer windows; eaves-dropping is disreputable, you know. vWe must just slip out of our window, give one wild, ringing cheer of Excelsior, and mount to the ridge-pole. Luckily, it is not a steep affair. It won't be so hard to climb as 'the steep where Fame's proud temple shines afar.' Once there, we will ride as on a rail, not quite so fast and furious as an old fish- woman on a rail, but slow and sure,' astride the anticlinal slopes of great events.' We arrive at the house-facilis descensus, you know-we drop down upon them like a dew-drop from a lion's mane. Oh! I'm for Mr. Boggs' plan.' "But," objected the Captain, " we just as much make an illegal and burglarious entry by breaking in at the dormer win- dow as by breaking in at a door, and are just as responsible for the homicide that may follow, and that probably will-follow; for these fellows will show fight." "Ah, but we have a chance of making our perquisitions in private, and perhaps of finding the old woman and carrying her off without any row," replied Mr. Boggs. ' That chance is worth something." "That is true," replied the Captain, " and I don't oppose the plan, but we must be prepared for all events. There is no use of blinking the fact that the service is one of difficulty and danger. I have seen Monsieur Brochu and his compan- ions, and I am much mistaken if they are not about as ugly customers as can be found in the city. Shall we go armed?" The Captain's question led to a long discussion, in which all the arguments on either side were fully examined, and finally it was decided that it would be best not to carry pistols o0   NE VER A GA IN.        , 5 7 knives; that they might put themselves terribly in the wrong by using deadly weapons, and that knuckle-dusters and police- men's bludgeons would be all that it would be best to allow themselves. "'Tis the wisest way," concluded the Captain. "There is a terrible temptation to use a pistol or a knife unnecessarily sometimes. I have known an officer rush for his pistol and shoot two or three men simply because he had it capped and loaded all loose at the head of his berth, whereas if he had had it locked up, unloaded, in his chest he would just have con- tented himself with a belaying-pin or marling-spike, and ended the muss with a few knock-downs that would hardly have hurt i a sucking infant; and besides," he continued, "we ought not to need the pistols. Here's Luther, young and active, and wiry as a panther, and I understand that with the gloves on he can take the kinks out of some of the best men they've got at the gymnasium. Then, here's Mr. Boggs. I am a pretty good judge of thews and sinews, and there is an easy length of limb and a depth of chest there that mean a monstrous sight of work, I guess, at a short call; and as to Mr. Whop- pers-well, Whoppers, your frame was not got out for a double- decker, but I suspect you can carry a good deal more than your measured tonnage. I should doubt a little whether your backstays were as well set up as they might be, but you're pretty well sparred, and they do say that when you flogged the fighting editor of the New York ztrly-Blurly you made a handsome job of it, and finished him off in first-rate style." "Oh, belay that, Captain. You make me blush before Boggs and Luther here." ' Oh no, it was the other fellow that blushed. I hap- pened to mention your name to Mr. Mills, my first mate, yesterday, when he said that he saw the whole thing. He was in Wall Street at the time. He says that the way you sailed into your enemy was a sight for the curious. If Barnum could have bought it and put it in his museum, it would have been worth five thousand dollars to him. Mills says that he at first thought the other fellow was going to i   5ir        NVE VER AGAIN.  weather on you when he hit you a sockdologer on the mug, but you boxed off a little, and then sprung your luff, got your grappling-irons on his throat, bore him down on to his beam. ends, and then flourished your feet and fists like a regular artist, and in about half a minute after you had boarded him you had put his dead eyes in and painted a black streak under them; had worked a Turk's head on his nose as big as a lemon; had smashed in his head rails and started two or three of them down his progway. Mr. Mills says that the blood ran from his scuppers like a sluice from a tan-yard or a Cincinnati pork-mill, and that in the half minute you had his head careened down over the curb-stone it colored the gutter from Trinity Church to Pearl Street." "Mr. Mills is a-a-d-d-     Well, I won't say what Mr. Mills is," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers in a tone that showed he by no means relished the Captain's comical ex- aggerations. In fact it was a sore subject, 'and any allusion to it was apt to disturb the usual serenity of his temper. It is often -observed that no people more readily wince under any little rubbing of their sore spots than those who are forever seeking out and touching up the raws of their neighbors. "Beg pardon.  I meant no offence," replied the Captain. "Oh, no offence!" replied Mr. Whoppers. "A fellow is bound to make a devilish fool of himself some time in' his life; but it isn't always the pleasantest subject of conver- sation afterwards." "But I don't see that it was such a foolish business. If the  Hurly-Burly fellow had got the better of you-ah, in that case perhaps. But tell us how it came about." "Well, it's too long a story to go into all the details. You've all of you heard of the amenities of newspaper litera- ture?-that is, when one editor calls another-cheat, liar and villain." "Why, do they ever do that?" demanded the Captain in a tone of surprise. "Sometimes, but it is considered bad  taste to use the naked words. The better style is do it by implication, or I          -,   NE VER A GAIN.         5I9 what you may call the roundabout or, circumlocutory process; as for instance, instead of calling a man a thief, you begin an article on c Kleptomania in general.' Show that it is not a new disease, but that it was known to the ancients, and that it was clearly alluded to by Celsus in one of his eight books de medicina; that it was also described, in more modern times, by the great Boerhaave, and by the famous Fabricius ab Aquapendente in his treatise de furtivis. You then suggest a hospital for the treatment of patients afflicted with that dis- ease, from which category, however, you of course except cases like that of the editor of the Flipper. For his case there is already a capital asylum established at Sing Sing, where the Autolycus of the press would find a suitable regime, and where the gentle exercise of cutting and carving a compound of carbonic acid and lime might exert a curative effect upon his diseased habits. At any rate, as y ou suggest, that is his only chance, for it is well known that when total depravity assumes the continuous type characterized by one universal and never ending exacerbation, the prescriptions of a criminal judge, or police magistrate, are always infinitely more efficacious than those of any physician. Or suppose you want to accuse a fellow of lying, begin in this wise, as far off as possible: 'It is generally admit- ted that Plutarch's works on morals are far inferior to his lives of distinguished ancients. But even as a mor- alist, although accused of entertaining erroneous- doctrines, superstitious fancies, and puerile and even disgusting sentiments, he sometimes makes a remark of singular pro- fundity. As for instance, in his life of Lysander he says that to lie is to manifest both a contempt of God and a fear of man. Now this suggests a question we would like to ask the United States Radiator, hoping that an answer--if answer is vouchsafed-will for once in the way be given with some of that regard to the decencies of language which we are proud to say has ever characterized the columns of this jour- -nal. And our question is this: "Did the Editor of the Radiator, in his recent passage of senile declamation, evince a   520        NEVER A GAIN.  greater contempt of God than fear of man, or a greater feat of man than, contempt of God?"' "Or, you can begin with Sir Thomas Browne, or Lord Bacon, or Jeremv Ta3ylor, or Montaigne. Something in this style: 'What a vivid idea of the atrocious cruelty that char. acterized the Spanish conquest of America do we get when we find that Montaigne, who lived and wrote so short a time after the great discovery in 1492, is compelled to apologize for not giving the names of certain nations, whose laws and customs he has occasion to mention. And his excuse is that the desolation of that conquest had extended to the utter abolition of names. Only the fraction of a century, and the pall of oblivion is drawn by the cruel hands of greed and bigotry over the very places where they existed. Luckily, some memory of their laws and customs remained in the time of the great essayist, and he has happily recorded theln for us. Among others, he especially mentions one--a curious religious ceremony-the offering to their gods of human 'blood, but blood drawn only from the ears and tongue in expiation of the sin of lying. What a curious, but what a lucky thing for some of us, but especially for our friend and neighbor, the Editor of the New York Comet, that we live in a country where no such sacrifice is required. In his case, crapulous tongue however crass, and pendulous ears however long, would hardly contain blood enough to expiate the sins of a single issue, or to appease the manes of whole hosts of murdered truths who stalk in indignant and ghastly ghostli- ness through his columns. We are afraid that it would be found necessary to tap that rubicund proboscis, and let out some of that blood which, as it is the product of libations, or potations rather, of old rye and Bourbon, in common fairness, perhaps, ought to be devoted only to the altars of Bacchus.' "Now that," continued Mr. Whoppers, "is the true way to do it. Thief, liar, and rascal, is decidedly vulgar and of no force. We  don't really reach our adversary with such shot. I  had been called all those epithets by the Hutry-BZurly over and over again. - I didn't mind it; I just conformed to   the amenities of journalism, and dug away at him in the circumlocutory style; sticking a pun into him now and then, and whipping him up, whenever he slopped over, with a Latin quotation or two. At last he struck a little harder. He called me,-what do you suppose? A paranomastical pre- tender; said that I had never made a decent pun ; and that just after we had been dining together, and I had let off half-a-dozen of my very best. He said that I had entirely mistaken the aphorism about punning and pocket-picking, and that I must not suppose that, because I had frequently been caught at the one, I had any talent for the other. It was cutting pretty close, but you won't suppose that, for such a cause, I made an infernal fool of myself, and resorted to per- sonal violence. No, it was something more aggravating than that. It was just the one single thing that no editor can stand. He said that my circulation had fallen off-that it never had amounted to much; in fact, that if I had my deserts, I ought to be indicted for swindling my poor, deluded advertisers, and obtaining their money under false pretences. That was right on the raw. I not only winced, but fairly kicked over the traces, and down I rushed, and pitched into him. But enough of that subject. I don't like to think of it, still less to talk about it; so we will go back to the question of arms. I agree with you, Captain, that it will be best for us to go unarmed, and that four of us ought to be able to manage any three desperadoes in town." It required but little' further discussion to settle their plan of operations so far as any plan could be settled beforehand. Only one thing could be decidedly determined at the time, and that was, Mr. Boggs was to secure the vacant house at an early hour in the morning, and that at night they were to corn mence operations and be governed by circumstances. "Let us hope for darkness," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, as the party broke up at a late hour. "Not that our deeds are evil. 'Merker the night the better tyde for love,' says old Rowley; but I say, ' merker the night the better tyde for loafing round chimney-pots and peering into dormer windows. "'   522         NEVEER AGAIN. CHAPTER XXVIII. Boggs hires a House-Uncle Shippen's Lecture-The Nature and Origin of Evil. IT is a curious fact that if we go to sleep with the mind fully charged with the idea that some necessity exists for our waking at an hour earlier than our usual habit, the mind seldom forgets to call itself at the right time. When we trust to an alarm-clock, or to the services of a domestic or night. watchman, it is true we are, if through accident or neglect undisturbed, apt to oversleep ourselves. But that is because *we have not entered in a legible hand on the innermost leaves of memory the hour at which we wish to be awakened, and have trusted to outward forces rather than to the unconscious cerebration which goes on perhaps more actively in a sleeping than in a waking state. Mr. Boggs seldom had occasion to be called at an early hour, but his internal monitor was alert and punctual. He was up, dressed, and out by nine o'clock. For a society-man, and one, too, who fully coincided in opinion with Uncle Shippen on the subject of sleep, nine may be considered wonderfully early. In fact too early, if it is, as Uncle Shippen maintains, the absolute duty of every man who can to sleep up to his constitution. That is, he ought to stop sleeping only just long enough to allow his assimilative and absorbent functions fair play. "For don't you see," says Uncle Shippen, "Iife is justly defined to be nothing more or less than an effort of force to reveal itself in consciousness. Now this effort is a wearing and a tearing one, and life is short in consequence. But in sleep this effort is partially or wholly   NE VER AGAIN.         I 523 suspended; there is no consciousness then, and the conse- quence is that the more you sleep the longer you live." It was not always safe to say when Uncle Shippen was joking, and when in earnest, but Mr. Boggs had accepted his aphorism, that it was proper for a man to sleep up to his constitution, and was always astonished, and somewhat chagrined, and more than half determined to try a little hy- drate of chloral, when he was up and out before twelve. Mr. Mealy was luckily at home, and negotiation for the vacant house was unusually short. Mr. Boggs' reference to the portly sexton of Grace Church was satisfactory, especially as the rent was to be paid monthly in advance. There was only a little delay of fifteen minutes, and that was required for Mr. Mealy's protestations, made over and over again, that he would not for the world let the house for any improper purposes, or to any improper characters; that he never did let his houses to any but the most respectable persons. In a few cases he may have been deceived. He could not always help being deceived; nB one could. In fact, there were two or three wealthy house-owners in his own church who had been deceived, but as long as a house was let With pure intentions, the inmates, however abandoned, might perhaps be made the subject of prayer, but could not very well be turned out. He had heard of some wicked people who evaded the statute by selling a house to an improper female, and then taking back a mortgage for the purchase-money. There is no law against collecting interest on a mortgage from whatever source. But that is a subterfuge, an evasion of the law. No right-minded and pious person could be guilty of it. He, at least, could not, and therefore\he never let any of his houses except to respectable persons. And he was satisfied that in this case he was getting a respectable tenant. The mere mention of Mr. Brown's name was sufficient. He knew Brown; he had bought horse-feed from him, and Mr. Brown had buried his brother-in-law's first cousin in highly-respectable style. Had never seen the ashes-to-ashes and dust-to-dust part of the per- formance done more splendidly; and the coffin-beg pardon   5 24        NE VERA' AGAI4 IN. those old-fashioned words will slip out sometimes-the casket was of such beautifully polished rose wood, and the handles, hinges, screw-heads, and all of the finest Gorham plate. SMr Boggs couldn't have given a better reference. Everybody knows that Mr. Brown has to do only with our very best and most fashionable people. Not that he should refer to him, because he was perfectly satisfied that he was letting his house to a gentleman of high character and correct morals. It was thought by many of his friends that he ought, perhaps, ton make some inquiry-into the religious sentiments of his tenants. But he did not go so far as that. This is a free country, and liberty of conscience is guaranteed by the Con- stitution. And, in fact, he had always been something of a liberal. He had always contented  himself with high morality, and strict punctuality, in his tenants, and he didn't mind if some of them did go to the little church round the corner-ha! ha!  This last piece of facetiousness was too much for Mr. Boggs. H He seized the keys and started for the door. "Hold on for a moment, and I will go with you, and put you in possession." "Not at all necessary. I can unlock the doors myself. H won't trouble you.'" "Prefer to move your family in without observation? All nice and quiet, eh!  Well, I hope your wife will be pleased with the house. His wife indeed," continued Mr. Mealy, turning to his clerk. "He thinks I don't know him, but I do. He's a fashionable man, and as big a sinner as there is in  town." The house proved to be dilapidated, dirty, and generally disgusting. Mr. Boggs made a thorough survey, from the cellar  to the garret. From  the lower apartment he was glad to  retreat on the double quick, driven out by the fierce stench of  piles of decaying kitchen refuse. A sickening perfume-an indescribable odor of something which addressed itself, per-  haps, as much to the imagination as the senses-pervaded the upper rooms. The gaudy wall-paper of the parlors hung    aEVER AGA IN.         525 here and there in strips. It bore the marks of dirt)y hands, and the scratches of roughly-handled tables and sofas, and the indentations of tilted up chairs. It was stained with cigar smoke and spattered and spotted with Champagne; and all around, about the height of a man when in a sitting posture, it had been smooched by dirty heads into a brown wainscoting of grease. A wide dark stain marked the rickety flooring, and at every step the boards squeaked and groaned, as if the ghosts of half-a-dozen murdered men were gibbering out their useless cries for vengeance. Mr. Boggs paused and looked around. He was no senti- mentalist, no idealist, no philanthropist, no enthusiast; he was, and prided himself on being, a man of the world; a man who looked at the facts of real life in the face. A man who knew that the world had been growing better very, very slowly, and, while admitting something of progress, had no confidence in the crude whimsies of rampant reform. Yet when Mr. Boggs stood in the middle of that room, and the visions of countless orgies rose up before him-orgies characterized by no refinement, no elegance, no taste, but coarse and vulgar and obscene--orgies of pure sensuality and sin, at which hundreds of men, some of respectability and promise, had assisted; and when he thought of the poor helpless victims, not of man's faithlessness and treachery, as the case is usually put, but the victims of society's inhumanity and unsympathetic reckless- ness; the victims of feminine frivolity and vanity and. prodi- gality; the victims of the circumstances and surroundings into which they were born-when Mr. Boggs thought of this, and of the vast net-work of social evil with all its consequences, physical and moral, immediate and remote, patent to all or the secret of the moralist and pathologist, he felt a little some- thing of that intense contempt for existing institutions, that fierce burning desire to tear up the whole social system by the roots, and replace it by anything provided with the great merit of being something utterly different, and entirely new, which characterizes the radical reformer of the day. He could not help it.   526         NE VER AGCArN. ," And yet," sighed Mr. Boggs, "what ,is the use? Why disturb one's mind with ugly thoughts to no purpose? This world is probably the best possible world that could be under the circumstances. 'As Uncle Shippen says, considering that it is an inferior member of probably a very inferior solar sys. tem, it is a very good world." Mr. Boggs took a few turns  up and dozwn the roaoll. Jte recurred to a recent conversa. tion with Uncle Shippen, or ratler to several conversations, for Uncle Shippen was fond of getting upon such subjects.  He had his speculative hobbies, gaunt, shaggy, ill-fed fellows, not to be compared with the sleek, smooth roadsters of the great thinkers of the day, but, nevertheless, once mounted it was im- possible to dismount him, and difficult to make him draw rein. "Pain, sir, and sin, are the essentialelements ofprogress. WIitl . out what we call evil this world would be, if it could be at all, a miserable world.  Beg pardon for the seeming paradox, but it is wholly owing to the imperfection of language. You see we areplaced I:ere like a railroad train on a set of rails. We can'stand still forever-we must move; we do move, but about every five minutes we run off the rails, and what is the consequence? Why a   smash, and that smash is what we call  evil-the penalty for not sticking to the rails. We improve I the road-bed a  little and start again. Smash, smash, siash. It won't do; we must lengthen our curves, ballast again here and there, widen our flanges, couple up shorter, and oil our axles. It goes better, but it won't do; there is a screw loose somewhere, and there is consequently ajar, shake, noise, and now and then a  smash. Find out where it is, screw it up, and whiz!  we should- go up and down the grades of a life of perfect happiness without a jolt. "Inevitable and unavoidable evils, you say? Bah! sir; there is no such thing. All alike-the result of ignorance, but much more of carelessness and contempt of the simplest laws. Mental, moral, and physical evil! All man's work, sir, directly, or existing only by man's sufferance. Talk of disease and pain and premature death! Who's to blame, eh? Say that God sends them!   Why it's flat blasphemy. Take disease.   VNE VER A GA IN.        5 2 7 Nine-tenths of disease come from in'io or koingprivate or pub- lic-miasma. Now the disease that comes from your private miasma-your typhus and ship-fevers, as well as your scarlet fever and small-pox, and a whole host of similar diseases, are made and disseminated by society with the most industrious care. It creates or it catches its miasma, or its nice little germ of contagion, and prepares its hot-bed, and nurses it, and cultivates it as if it was some lovely flower. And as for koino miasma-what we call malaria, man is wholly to blame there, too. Man makes it, or tolerates and encourages it, or refuses the commonest precautions against its influence. The laws of malaria are well known, and Mr. Planly has an invention for taking advantage of them in the worst cases, as in Italy for instance, and cultivating the malaria out of existence. But he's too soon, as I told him, by about a thousand years. Fe- vers and epidemics of all kinds have luckily not yet finished their proper work, which is to keep down and thin out the human race until lthe reproduction of mankind is reduced to scientific rule and method. Why, do you know, sir, they say that every mouthful of air we draw contains not only the germs of from fifteen to twenty different forms of cryptoga- mous vegetation, but also a certain number of starch grains, and that not only in the air we actually breathe, but in the air we might breathe standing up on the top of the Peak of Ten- eriffe or Chimborazo. Now did God put these starch grains there directly, or dlid man? And if man, how long a time has it taken him to do it, and how much flour has he made to enable him to do it? Don't you see the question of the an- tiquity of man comes up strong? but that isn't the point. A third, and more pertinent question is, If man put those starch grains there, why can't he take 'em out? Do you suppose that, a thousand years hence, when for want of soil and pabu- lumn most of our diseases have died out of existence, and when men will no more think of breathing or drinking unfiltered or unpurified air or water than they will of breeding consumptive or scrofulous children, the generations then existing will look back upon the manners and customs of our day with any  528        NXEVER AGAIN. less contempt than we now feel for the manners and customs of our ancestors before their tails were worn off, when mar. riage was unknown, and cannibalism was common?" In this way Uncle Shippen would ramble on whenever he got a chance, and there was no one whom he liked to lecture better than Mr. Boggs, who had, as we have said, a philo. sophic streak in his composition, which, combined with a lazy streak, made him an excellent subject. Mr. Boggs stopped short in his work, and shook his head, "I am afraid it won't do, Uncle Shippen," he exclaimed aloud. "The idea that progress is necessarily so very slow, and so much the result of a very gradual development under the guidance of inexorable general law, and that misery and sin are such essential conditions and concomitants that it isn't worth while for a philosopher to trouble himself mtich about the matter, is very nice for a lazy man like myself, but I am  afraid the doctrine isn't quite true. I don't exactly believe it; I wish I could, but I can't. And yet, with a sense of duty weighing upon me, I sit still -and do nothing, while Uncle Shippen, with his maxim ever on his lips, 'Let the world wag,' is the most industrious philanthropist in the city.  Well, it only shows that habits and emotions are unfortunately stronger guides of conduct than principles. So now let us see what there is up-stairs." Mr. Boggs found nothing but vacant rooms. He mounted to the attic, tried the windows, found them unfastened, and ascertained that they could be thrown open without noise. He examined the roof and made sure that its slant was of that easy angle that clambering along it would not be at all difficult. Having made all the investigations necessary, he descen- ded rapidly to the street, glad to get once more into the free and comparatively pure air. It was a  blustering, cloudy, lowering morning. There was something triste in the air, but, in) comparison with the heavy atmosphere and doleful melancholic suggestiveness of everything within, the street seemed joyful, and the weather bright and delightful.   NEVE R AGAIN.          529 Mr. Boggs hurried around into Bleecker Street to keep his appointment with Luther and the Captain, and to make his report. He found them in company with Mr. Whoppers, who had not yet gone down to his office; all were impatiently awaiting his arrival. A few words sufficed to put them in possession of the facts, and not a little discussion followed, but it was evident that nothing more could be done until night. Luther felt a strong disposition to spend the rest- of the day in a close reconnaissance of the enemies' quarters, but the danger of recognition was too great. He must do some- thing, however; he could not sit still; he could not read or write; he refused the Captain's invitation to visit the Spoon- drift; he would take a long- walk by himself; and his walk, in order that it might be of sufficient length, led him more than half-a-dozen times around Washington Square. He knew that she was at West Point, but more than one senti- mental young gentleman has found a satisfaction in hanging around the spot where she-the she par excellence-the one bright particular she--the only she in the whole world-had been, or was likely to be again. Mr. Boggs, left to himself, thought at first that he would go to his club, but upon second thoughts he would be sure to meet that terrible fellow, Fred Tompkins, and if he didn't meet him, there was nothing to do there. No billiards-too early; and if not, billiards in the morning are disreputable and bad tone. As to euchre, that would be still worse, if it were possible, which it is not, to get up a hand until just before dinner. True, there was the amusement of staring out of the windows at the ladies on the avenue. That can be done at almost any hour, but a fellow with any brains gets awfully tired of that. And Boggs had brains. A bright idea! He would, yes, he would go around to his rooms, arrange his toilet, get himself up in his normal style, and go and see if Mrs. Stichen was still in town. Mr. Boggs really fancied that this was a sudden inspira- tion, whereas there had been a little devil whispering over  530        NEVER AGAIN.  his shoulder for the last three or four days urging him to go to Mrs. Stichen's, and partly because the little devil had so urged him he would not go. And yet the thought seemed now new and spontaneous, so completely does the sudden snap of volition, the sudden giving way of the will in some cases, obscure the previous intellectual processes and mystify the conscience. He had not seen her in some time-almost a week. In fact it was a much longer time than that since he had paid her a morning visit. He. knew the censoriousness of society, and he knew that there was more danger in one pull at a lady's door-bell in the morning, under the inevitable eye of some passing male gossip, or of some antiquated but active member of the scandal-mongering sisterhood, and at a time when the husband is presumably down town, than there is in a dozen evening visits. Any number of whirls in the German, my dear fellow, any amount of chat, with Champagne and chicken-salad attentions at matinees and receptions; but if you have any regard for Mrs. Sophronisbie's reputation, beware of often-repeated morning calls.   CHAPTER XXIX. Mrs. Stichen's Boudoir-A Morning Call-Just touch-and-go-Society here and abroad. F a very peculiar style of finish and furnish is the second floor front of the Stichen house. Nothing like it on the avenue. Many people don't admire it. Boggs did, and well he might; he had assisted Mrs. Stichen in getting it up. Stichen did not admire it, but then, with a generosity and self-abnegation worthy of a distinguished financier, worthy of a man whose soul is absorbed in the great things of the Street, he said, "As you please, my dear. I've no taste, you know. It is your room. Don't spare expense. Make it as elegant and unique,-I believe that was the word you used, Mr. Boggs, -as unique as you please, but down-stairs I must have a little of the ordinary and the commonplace. Lots of gilding, var- nish, real lace and brocade for the windows, and above all things the biggest kind of pier and mantel glasses. And I want plenty of that fresco stuff overhead, and a regular up and down imperial flower-garden on the floor. Some pictures? Well, yes, I believe that is respectable. Some jimcrackery, of  course. Everybody has it. And I don't mind if you get a great big ebony centre-table, inlaid with ivory-Milan work. Winnergelt has got one in his house, and he says it stands the furnace better than that French brass work. But as to this up-.stairs. sitting-room, or parlor, or boudoir, or whatever you are going to call it, do as you please. Make it as Moorish or as Turkeyfied as you like. And so it came about that Mrs. Stichen and Mr. Boggs had had their own way. The doors and windows had all   532         NEVER A G4AIV  been remodelled, and finished in horse-shoe arches, and sup. ported on slender double columns, and all carved in divers specks and spots, and dotted all over with little symmetrical dashes of yellow, blue, and red paint: the whole producing that kind of general harmony of color that we often see in a Chinese plate, but which is sometimes wanting in the more ele- gant and correct designs of Christian art. Tle ceiling was panelled in wood and similarly treated. A wide archway with sliding doors opened into the small room-over the hall, mak- ing it in fact part of the larger saloon. This small room was completely surrounded with book-cases, treated in the Moor- ish style. One peculiarity consisted in their being raised about five feet from the floor, on slender carved columns, al lowing space below for a continuous divan a'nd cushions. This arrangement had the advantage of saving space, although it did not allow a large number of books, only three or four rows; but if Mrs. Stichen's private library was small, it was exceed ingly choice and select. Around the walls of the larger room, at a height, ran a broad rail, or rather panel, formed of pallisandre,. bois de rose, and that most beautiful of all woods, the galls of the ash. From this rail or panel depended in folds to the floor a hang- ing of the richest Cashmere shawls. Above this panelling, or rather making part of it, a dozen or more plates, of exquisite Sievres, were imbedded in the carved wood. This idea Mr l Boggs admitted he had stolen from that most lovely of all rooms, the royal bedroom in the Moncalieri, outside Turin. Above this again the wall was panelled with silken hangings, made only in Milan, in which the beautiful arabesques, begin- ning with a deep rose-color, ran by an invisible gradation into a pale apple-green at the cornice, which was but little more than a slender beading of gold, connecting the silken walls and carved ceiling. The lambrequins of the window corresponded in texture and color, coming low down upon voluminous cur- tains of the richest thread lace. A chimney-piece of carved ash and maple was enlivened with a row of arabesques in Floren- tine mosaic. A rich,deep-tQned Turkey carpet suggested the   NEVER AGAIN.          533 height or rather depth of quiet and repose, as well in its tex- ture as in its color. From the ceiling depended a chandelier in Bohemian glass, the branches separating into clusters of cacti and fuchsias. A small malachite table here, and another of mosaic there; and still another of carved wood covered with a Persian scarf, and supporting a few articles of virtu, mostly in ivory or mother-of-pearl, or Dresden porcelain, assisted in lighting up the room. But the brightest thing in it was a jardiniere in Stvres work filled with natural flowers. We say the brightest thing in it, but that is a mistake. The brightest thing in it was Mrs. Stichen herself. Habited in a delicately embroidered cambric robe, enlivened here and there with a slight insertion of valenciennes, her yellow hair en coiffre r e ematin-in English, artistically dishevelled and falling around her brow and cheeks and neck in an indescrib- able labyrinth of lustrous frizettes and demi-ringlets-a book in her hand, and reclining in molluscous languor upon a mother- of-pearl reading-lounge, she seemed the centre and point from which emanated all the light in the room. It is doubtful if the Art Committee of the Century Club could have arranged the thing in more artistic style. And yet Mrs. Stichen had no affectations, no conscious strainings after effect, no small vanities, and no especial liking for the common patent admira- tion-traps of society-women. She was really simple-minded, honest-hearted, and clear-headed, but she had been endowed at her birth with a keen sense of the beautiful, with a taste for the elegant, with, it must be confessed, a liking and a longing for the gorgeous; with, in fact, a grand talent, needing but the slightest cultivation, for the highest sphere of luxurious refine- ment. In other words, she was born with the soul of an artist. Like Venus Anadyomene, the earlier circumstances of her. life were against her. For years she lay buried beneath a sea of shirting, muslin, and Irish linen, but when she rose, she had the faculty of shaking off the foam of frills and plaits, of gus- sets and hems, and stepping right on to her proper pedestal in the inner courts of the temple of Fashion, where none but the initiated are permitted to kotou and rub their noses in the dust, in humble adoration of the transcendent mystery.   534        NEVER AGAIN. A little negro boy, of the blackest type, and habited in a tasselled fez and embroidered caftan, trimmed with rows of tiny gold bells, and in baggy Moorish- trowsers of. the finest white flannel, fastened at the knee with large buckles of gar. net and topaz uniting them to red stockings, and with green slippers, embroidered with pearls, held open the door for Ir., Boggs, who cast an admiring glance at the imp. "It is as good as a play," he muttered; " better than an ordinary play; it is as good as the Black Crook; it is as good as the circus." Mr. Boggs paused at the threshold for an instant. A fine invisible something seemed to check him, and hold him spell- bound. Was it the sudden peeping out of some little lurking villain of a sentiment which had been lying perdue all this while?- No, it was of course nothing but the peculiar light in which the lustrous hair, the snowy dress, the graceful attitude happened to be exhibited. Still Mr. Boggs did not feel quite so much at his ease as usual. The conviction that the old relation of master and pupil might be slipping away, and that he might yet be found taking as well as giving lessons in a science deeper than any social or society science, deep as the science of humanity itself, had hardly time to formulate itself" in words; but i swift flash of vague fear darted through lhim -a suspicion that perhaps after all he had not of late been quite so platonic as he had supposed himself. "Confound it,"' he muttered. "If this should be like all the rest of 'em." The idea pricked his pride, slightly it is true, and still more- slightly his conscience. He was not however a man to allow any slight prickings of conscience to disturb the easy equanimity of his manners. He advanced into the room. "Don't rise, my dear Mrs. Stichen," he exclaimed. "I should be sorry to disturb an attitude of such perfect grace." Mrs. Stichen colored -slightly, said nothing, but held out her hand. Perhaps Mr. Boggs pressed it a little more warmly than usual. At any rate the lady colored still more deeply and drew her hand rapidly away. "We have not seen you for almost a week," she said.      NE VER AGAIN.         535 "No, and I don't think you will see me again for some time," replied Mr. Boggs, throwing himself into a Shaker rocking-chair, "Why so?" demanded the lady. "Because if you continue to get yourself up in such an enchanting style I can't afford to visit you. It is running too much risk." The lady looked about uneasily for a moment, and her countenance assumed a very sad expression. Mr. Boggs leaned forward so as to lessen the distance between them. 'You look unhappy," he said. "Something troubles you. Tell me what it is. You know that you can- not have a sincerer friend than I am., Don't you, my dear'-- alas, he could not make himself pronounce the ugly words, Mrs. Stichen, so he said, " my dear Lizzie?" It was the first time he had ever called her Lizzie, unless in jest and before Stichen himself, and now it had such a wonderfully thrilling sound. The simple word, Lizzie! It cut so swiftly and keenly into her heart that she did not feel much pain, and that frightened her. Her decision was made on the instant. A moment more and she might lose her friend. She would not-she could not afford to-lose her friend. If Goethe had whispered to her: "Fast asleep is Amor lying- Do not touch him-do not wake him," she could not have been more resolute and more clear. Suddenly she turned with vivacity to Mr. Boggs, and laid her hand imploringly on his arm. "Mr. Boggs, may I talk to you plainly about something?" "Certainly! Is there any subject forbidden us?" "Yes," replied Mrs. Stichen emphatically, and sinking back into her seat. "There are subjects forbidden-for- bidden by every feeling of honor and honesty-forbidden, of all people in the world, to us." Her voice began to assume the slight huskiness that often betrays a deeper feeling than the speaker intends to   5 3 6       Vk NEVER AGAIIV. show, and which invariably grows worse the more violent the effort to prevent it. The only way is to stop apd take a different pitch. Mrs. Stichen paused, and looked embarrassed. "Go on," exclaimed Mr. Boggs in an encouraging tone. "May I?" said the lady. "But why should I ask? I know I may; you are both too kind and too wise to mis- understand me. Well what I want tc -.ay is, that at our first acquaintance you promised that you would never pay me any of the usual idle compliments of society." "But what if any compliments I now pay you, however exaggerated or stilted in form, are not idle, or meaningless, or false?" demanded Mr. Boggs. "You promised more," continued Mrs. Stichen, un- heeding the interruption, 'voluntarily promised, you will recollect; you promised to be an honest, straightforward friend. You promised to advise me, direct me, reprove me; never to flatter me, never to pay me any attentions that would excite remark; never to permit anything between us that looked like flirtation; no idle gallantries on your part, no sentimental demonstrations on mine. When you said, jokingly it is true, but, as I knew, in dead earnest, that you were not going to allow me to fall in love with you, I did not feel it as an impertinence, as in the case of a single man to a married woman it might well be. I took it thankfully as a warning. I know my weakness, my ignorance; and I felt proud to have a friend who had the honesty and the courage to say such a thing to me. You said openly -and candidly that my beauty and general atractions were well worthy of any man's gallant attentions. And I saw no harm in that, because I thought that you spoke the plain truth in a proper way and on a proper occasion; but you also said that one consideration, if there were no other, would prevent you from being the man. You said that my husband was your friend, that you were under many obligations to him, and that, as a man of honor and a gentleman, you were bound to never think, say, or do anything unworthy of the confidence he ,   AN VER A GAN.         537 had placed in you. Oh, Mr. Boggs, you know perfectly well, and it can do no harm to confess it, that my husband is not my highest idea of a man, but he is a true man--a man with a big and pure heart--a generous man, an honest man, and a confiding man; and I declare to you, Mr. Boggs, with my whole soul, that sooner than give him one pang of jealousy, one doubt of my entire rectitude as his wife, I would be willingy to walky of this house, give up- society, friends, music, dress, e&'e^ ing; and go back, and work by his side again in the little old factory in Broome Street." Mrs. Stichen had reached a climax, and as every one knows this figure, when of the feminine order, has but one natural close, she buried her face in her handkerchief and burst into a passion of tears. Mr. Boggs never moved a muscle. He sat quietly, staring with all his eyes; staring not only at heir, but beyond her, and around her, and by a curious introversion of vision, at himself. He saw, as it were, by the flash of an electric lanp, his own condition. He saw himself pluncged, in one swift moment, into the depths of a helpless, hopeless love. Mr. Boggs had but little religion proper. He had been born of a good old family, in a day when the term good old families really meant something in the then select society of New York. That is, before the irruption of outside bar- barians from the east and from the west -from the valleys of Rhine and the slopes of Taunus, on the one hand, and the gulches of Nevada and placers of California on the other-from the great Celntre of the Universe whence, to-day as of yore, issues the miraculous mandate, "Let there be light," together with all its outlying lands of New England, on this side, and from the cities of the South on that-before, long before this invasion had so diluted the Knickerbocker element, or had so completely cowed the veritable aristocracy of the city, that its social assertiveness has almost fallen into a pitiful plaint, with now and then a spasmodic but useless denunciation of the growth of uncultured, ill-man- nered, noisy vulgarity. noisy   538        NE VER AGA4 IA7?. From one of these old families Mr. Boggs was descended. Was not his grandmother the daughter of Livingstone, L. Livingstone of Livingstone-Livingstone Upper Manor,--no, Livingstone Lower Manor-well, it makes no difference; the faMnor, any wav. As for his father, didn't he come in witl the first English Governor, and hold all manner of offices, and when he died didn't his son succeed 1b' nd when this son  died, was there not the biggest fiuner, - known? Don't the chronicles of New York gives us *6 details and the cost?  A thousand pounds sterling if a penny, and the revels lasted three whole days after the definct was in his tomb, to which he had been escorted by the- highest burghers of the high Order of Noble Burghers-founded by the great Petrus-- with Lovelace, the English Governor, and Balthasar, the son of Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Governo1-, heading the  crowd.  And let him that doubts that more goodl old wine was expended upon that occasion than ever fell in libation to the manes of an Augustus Caesar, let him search the chronicles or ask Bancroft, or Dr. O'Callagan, or Broadhead, or George Moore.   We wash our hands of such skepticism, and hasten back to our text. Boggs had little or no religion, but coming of such a family he had been baptized and confirmed, of course. He couldn't help that, but he had never made a profession, or experienced a  change. He was not much stronger in morals; true he had looked into the theories. He had just received a shock from reading Lecky's prefatory chapter.. He  was a thorough derivatist, but in practice he ws not strong; he did not pre- tend to be a  strictly moral man. He did not plume himself upon principle. Certainly it is a very creditable thing when a man of that  kind resists temptation, sends the devil off with a flea in his ear, and resolutely sets himself about doing the right thing. It speaks well also for the society which produces him. It makes one think that perhaps fashionable people are almost as good as unfashionable people, and that society2farexcellenlce is not a  mere gathering of all that is frivolous, worthless, and 7-7-  -.CFt-  i1 F-i- . *-^   N'VE 'ER A GA4.        539 vile. It makes one almost question the authority of the knowing country parson, the learned college professor, or the gentle provincial moralist in general, as to the irredeemable demor- alization that pervades the upper ranks of city life. The correlation of vulgarity and virtue is a doctrine which has been extensively taught by very good authority- the novel of society; but its truth may well be doubted. Closer and more extended observation, a more copious induction of fashionable facts, will lead to the conclusion that all the bad- ness is not confined to the extreme upper sets of the upper-ten- thousand, and that when Mrs. Smith denounces her whilom humble, but now fashionable friend, Mrs. Brown, as " such a a dreadfully worldly woman," she herself is not any more surely and directly in the road to Heaven, albeit she never had cards for the three or four balls of the season, and still less ever had an invitation to show at the' elegant and elevated "'gabble-gobbles," as Mr. Wlhoppers calls them, of the Fair- fields, the Arelins, and others of the Square, or the Starlings, the Montabellos, the De Belleverts, etid omne genus of the Avenue, or ever had, an opportunity of gratifying a taste for the delicate baroque and rococo at any of Malleusly's orig- inal and recherche entertainments. As Mrs. Stichen ceased to sob, Mr. Boggs leaned forward and gently pulled away the handkerchief, and looked down into those glistening eyes with an open, earnest glance. He took her little plump hand, and squeezed it, no longer in a fondling way, but rather roughly, and gave it a good honest shake. "You're right, my dear Mrs. Stichen ; quite right. You make me proud of my pupil have no fear of my misunder- standing what you have said; you did well to speak in time. Things of this kind grow so fast, it is well to root them up early. Pull idle weeds in the morning; and they'll wither before night. Chuck them at- -once on Lethe's tide, and you'll never be bothered with the seed. That's a nice figure isn't t?--ha! ha!" Mr. Boggs laughed, and resolutely buttoned the folds of !*   540        NE VER A GAI. his heart over a " varmint" that threatened to gnaw into his vitals as deeply as did the stolen fox of the famous Spartan boy. No use in pausing; but get back at once to the jaunty style, and plunge at once into the gossipy or the didactic, no matter how commonplace or stupid. "How is Stichen.?" he suddenly demanded. "He has quite recovered?" "Oh yes, strong as ever. It was just a little vertigo. He never entirely lost consciousness, you know. He says it was nothing but those sweet things at Delmonico's that disagreed with him, but- think it was the excitement of business. And that makes me a little afraid, now, for you know they say there is a terrible time in the Street." The determined, easy tone of this question and answer banished all trace of emotion. It was just touch-and-go, but the danger was past. No use of another word. The darkl lurid mists of passion had lifted, and disclosed nothing but the cool glitter of a landscape lighted only by the full pure moon of friendship. Ah, false Sir Launcelot and faithless Guinevere-why could you not have behaved as nicely?'" "A terrible time, indeed," responded Mr. Boggs, "but you need not be frightened about Stichen. His mind is easy. He must be raking it in now like a hay-maker in June, and it never hurts any man's health to make money. That last little thing he let me into netted me a clean five thousand. I assure you I never felt less like dyspepsia in my life. Ah, money is a most excellent tonic, and making it the best exercise. I suppose that if we rightly estimate mundane matters it is the greatest, if not the highest, pleasure in life." You don't believe a word you say." "You think so?" "I do, and for several reasons," replied Mrs. Stichen. "In the first place I have heard you express yourself very dif- ferently, and in the next place, not believing much in money myself, I can't think that a man of your sense should believe in it either. It is true you have never had so wide an experi- ence as I have. I have known the utter want of money, and now I know what it is to have too much."              '      .--a    NEE E R AGA IV.        541 "Too much, my dear Mrs. Stichen? That's impossible." "Indeed it is not. Do you know, Mr. Boggs, I am getting very tired of all this thing? Shall I confess to you, what I hardly dare confess to myself, that I am not satisfied with all this luxury? I thought it would be Such a fine thing, and I knew it would come some day, and so I studied for it, and tried to prepare myself for it. I endured my mean boarding- house life without a murmur, because I knew and felt nothing of the present. I lived only in the future. I confided in my dreams. I knew that the elegant, the refined, the gorgeous, and the glorious would some day be mine. Why, do you know, I worked at my music, not half so much for the pleasure it then gave me as music, but for the delight I should take in it when I should hear my voice ringing through gilded saloons and marble halls, and listen to the gentle 'bravas' and to the muffled clappings of kid gloves. And now it has all, and more than all, come true; and I have nothing left in the way of luxury and dress and show to wish for, and I am a poor miserable woman." Mrs. Stichen uttered these last words in such a sincerely mournful tone that any man would have felt justified in express- ing his sympathy in words, but Mr. Boggs merely looked the feeling he felt-no fellow can control the expression of his eyes, you know-and said nothing. "My husband,' continued Mrs. Stichen, "says to me- you know that he has plenty of sense, if he is a little coarse -he says, 'Lizzie, you have triedosociety now, and it don't pay. Why don't you dive into philanthropy? Get yourself in as Directoress, or Governoress, or Presidentess, or some- thing or other, and draw on me for the expenses?' Well, I do draw on him for the expenses pretty roundly. I give and give, but it don't seem to do any good, at least to me, and as for anrthing more, why in some cases I don't like the manage- ment, in others I doubt the utility, but worse than all, I have none of the right habits and no tastes or inclinations that way." "But society, my dear Mrs. Stichen." *                     ,    542        NE VER A GA IN. '"Pshaw, Mr. Boggs, you know society better than I do, and I really believe you like it less. You know what a hum- bug it is-"  "A comparative humbug-not exactly a humbug perse-- not a positive humbug," interrupted Mr. Boggs. "You mean as compared with society abroad," said Mrs. Stichen. "Not at all. I don't think that ours is a humbug as com- pared with society abroad. Our society dresses almost as well, and dances quite as well, as the French. It is not so intellectual-not so spiriluelle-partly because many of our clever men have but little to do with it, and partly because the French women have cultivated habits of conversation. They have traditions of famous saloons." "Ah, that French causerie that I have read so much of," exclaimed Mrs. Stichen. "I should so like to hear something of it. Do you believe, Mr. Boggs, that what Jules Janin says is true,-' If there is any one knows more of the anecdotes and ideas, the facts and the fancies, the passions and the feel- ings, the doings in literature and art and politics, that move the world of to-day, than the Parisian, it is the Parisienne?" "I'll show you," replied Mr. Boggs, " the style of thing, as I see you have a book here handy." Mr. Boggs stepped up to the cases in the small room and took down a book, and running over the pages quickly found the passage he sought. "Listen. We will pay a visit to a French salon, and just have the goodness to imagine an infinite degree of vivacity, grace, and wit, which the reporter has not here indicated. "Our women trust to nature in this," said Mr. Boggs as he finished reading a passage too long for us to give here. " They think it enough to warble their wood-notes wild,-and devilish wild they are, too, sometimes. But it isn't the tone or pitch that I mind, it's the want of compass. The gamut of our society-women has only about five notes. Our church and ils parson, our children and servants, Mrs. Grundy's sayings and doings, with the Opera, and perhaps the last novel, make   NE 7VER A GAIN.        543 about the range, but within that I must say they trill, and run and generally appogiaturize nicely." "Ah, then you think that, as compared with the English our society is a humbug? The Hon. Mr. Flipperkin told me as much the other evening." ' Flipperkin is a donkey, and not the first one they have sent us from the other side. He really believes that Amer- icans talk, think, and dream of nothing but the 'Britishers.' And mentioning that word, I have asked fifty men at least if they ever heard an American use the word 'Britisher,' and I have never found one who had ever known a man who had heard or seen the word, except in the English press. I'll tell you what I happened to come across the other day, which illustrates this point exactly. I accidentally picked up a book of travels in America, by the Honorable Mr. Something or other; I forget his name. He had got a notion of American prudery. He had probably heard the story of the Yankee girl who, for decency's sake, put the legs of her piano in pantalets, and had gobbled it down and stowed it away in his innermost sanctum of profound verities. He wanted to be funny, and at the same time illustrate this striking American characteristic. Funny and profound at the same time ! No travelling John Bull that we have ever seen here could be expected to resist the temptation. He stops at the Astor House, and does as no one but a 'Britisher' is supposed to do more than once in six months-he takes a bath and changes his shirt. Alas! there was a button loose on the unmentionable garment. He had no needle and thread, so he steps out of his door into the hall and encounters an American chambermaid, and holding up the horrible thing in full view, asks her if she can get the button fastened on to his shirt! She, like a true Yankee girl, throws up both hands in an agony of shame, screams out ' Lawk, sir,' and turns and rushes down the corridor. Now what can you make of a fellow like that? He don't seem to have the least idea that he is romancing, and yet I'd like to make an even bet that there never has been a   544        NE VER A GAIN. Yankee chambermaid in the Astor House, and that if it had been filled with them, nothing that he could have said, done, or exhibited, would have made one of them scream 'Lawk, sir.' Flipperkins is one of this kind. He reads the Saturday Review, and he would sooner believe its assertion of any facts, in relation to the manners and customs oi American society, than his own eyes. He has been here a a year, and has really gone about a good deal in sets that Dickens from the first got himself absolutely shunted out of; and yet I'll venture to say that, in his secret mind, he really believes that there is not a getleman or lady in the land who don't ram knives down their throats in eating; that there is not a chair, ottoman, or sofa-cushion in the city un- marked by boot-heels, and not a square yard of Moquet, Im- perial, or Wilton unspotted with tobacco spittle. I like to amuse myself sometimes with Flipperkins. I said to him one day, when he was talking about the coarse customs of Americans, 'Flipperkins, do you know, the only gentleman that ever I saw stick a knife into his mouth in eating, was an English earl; a famous man too. He was my vis7a-vis at table in Milan; a big burly old fellow, pretty well crippled with the gout. I saw him distinctly twice, if not three times mash his peas on his plate and load his knife with the mass.' Flipperkins stood for two minutes with his mouth wide open, but unable to say a word." "Perhaps he thought you were telling a story, and was too polite to say so," said Mrs. Stichen. "Just so; I don't suppose he believed a word of it, but he was aghast-thunderstruck that such a story could have been invented. 'I don't suppose,' said I, in a patronizing tone, 'that is the common custom among the English nobility, as it is here, to mash peas on a plate and ram them down the throat with a knife, is it?' I marched off and left him speechless. Once upon a time," continued Mr. Boggs, " we had a visit from a great English philosopher-proverbially the greatest philoso- pher in England, and he brought along an amazing amount of condescension for the uncouth habits and customs of the   N E VER AGA4I.         545 transatlantic savage. So, one night, at a little gathering made in his honor, he pulls a chair with its back towards him, hoists his leg over it, and rests his foot on the seat, while he went on with his animated conversation. We all understood it, and enjoyed it mightily. It was not a piece- of coarseness, or rude- ness-no offence was intended; on the contrary, it was a most amiable conformity to the manners of the country. It was sim- ply saying, 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm the lion of the evening, it is true, but donkt mind me ; cock your feet upon the chimney- piece, and slap your legs, around on the chairs. I'm a phi- losopher, and can accommodate myself to anything short of cannibalism or tattooing.' I caught Flipperkins, and said, What do you think of that? He took a long stare through his eye-glass and exclaimed: 'How very extraordinary; why, he has not been more than three or four days in the country."' "Well, I'm glad I made Stichen give up tobacco-chewing some time ago," said Mrs. Stichen. "Of course, American gentlemen don't chew, with very rare exceptions, and then they are generally from the South. We all smoke-smoke terribly." Yes," interrupted Mrs. Stichen, "you not only smoke terribly, but horribly." "And yet," replied Mr. Boggs, " the thing is not as bad here as in other countries. We don't smoke as much as the Germans; we don't smoke as much as they do in Spain, where I have seen, more than once, a whole family come out on to the balcony half dressed, of an early morning, yawning and rub- bing their as yet unwashed eyes, and each and every one, father and mother, brothers and sisters, down to a little feminine six- year-old, with cigarettes in their mouths. We don't smoke more than the English; perhaps not so mush; but there is no doubt we smoke too much. The tradition abroad, however, is that we all chew. The idea of fine-cut or pig-tail appears to be so intimately associated with the idea of an American in the mind of an Englishman, that to separate them would be simply to unjoint the whole universe, and upset church and state and creation generally." 35   546        NEVER AGAIN.            "But what can you say, Mr. Boggs, about the cars?' demanded the lady, with a slight shudder, and an instinctive grasping of her skirts. "Oh, there you have touched the point exactly, and a soe  one it is," replied Mr. Boggs. "An Englishman finds himself  among a car-load of people, more than one-half of whom, are tinkers, and tailors, and mechanics of every degree; country shop-keepers or small farmers, and common laborers, and mingled with these, loafers and gamblers; and because they are all tolerably well-dressed, and quite intelligent-looking, and in general behave themselves with decency and dignity, he imagines himself to have had a thorough inlook into Amer. ican society, and that the filth on the floor must have come from the lips of the elite. "That is the kind of mistake, too, that is made about our folks abroad.  W do send some very queer people abroad, and some of our best give themselves great license in the rowdy line, when over there. This comes of their English blood.  It rises from the brutal contempt for all other people ingrained in the Anglo-Saxon race.  Different forces have softened manners in different countries. No one, however, will pretend that with us, and our cousins, self-respect has any great restraining energy. Public opinion is the great thing. That is the public opinion of our set. Let up a little on that, and the brutal barbarians of Hengest and Horsa begin to play, and we may be satisfied if we don't get sight of the nude woaded savage, or even that fellow with his stone hatchet, and his anthropophagous habits." "It is not English society, then, that you think so superior to ours? " asked Mrs. Stichen. "No, I  am inclined to think, from what little I have seen, that, compare the two, set by set, and class by class, they are about even. The American women dress better, and dance better; and the exccplional women here talk as well as the exceptional women there, and the rest prattle, or gossip, or gabble about alike; well or ill, just as you please. As to vulgarity, I rather think there is not much to choose. You *   r     *-- 1-1   NEVE -ER AGAI N.        547 recollect Becky Sharp speaks of a Duchess as a most vulgar woman, and Becky was a good observer. I never shall for- get the shock my youthful sensibilities received, a good many years ago, at the old Club House Hlotel in Gibraltar. There was a coarse, vulgar-looking, red-faced old dowdy, one morning, standing in the hall below, and in a voice that, would have been lovely in the driver of a shad-cart, was 'jawing,'--yes, that is the only word for it, coarse as it is,-was 'jawing' her maid, who, up three pairs of stairs, was leaning over the ballustrade, and giving back to her mistress about as good as she got. Who is that horrible old woman? said I. The Dowager Duchess of  . Good Heavens! one of the best-known titles in the peerage of Great Britain." "Oh, Mr. Boggs, if you should tell that story to Mrs. Slum- son," exclaimed Mrs. Stichen, throwing up her hand in a pretty little affectation of terror. "You know she thinks that we must have an aristocracy here, and that if we do, we ought to copy the English aristocracy; because the aristocracy of England is a great deal more aristocratic than the aristocracy of any other aristocratic country." "Oh Lord! I have told her the story half-a-dozen times." "What does she say? '  "Why, she says it's flat blasphemy, and that I am horrid, perfectly horrid, and that if she did not know that I came of an aristocratic family she should think me low-very low. Oh, she's a funny old piece. Her grandfather kept an oyster- stand in Washington Market. Her father rose to the dignity of cotton-broker and speculator, failed three times, and, of course, made money. Her maiden name was Hinny- Kate Hinny; so she traces a clear pedigree to Walter de Brienne, who became Duke of Apulia and King of Sicily. Don't you see B always changes into P, so Brienne becomes Prienne, and what more natural than that Prienne should become Prinny through mispronunciation? Just look at it--it's as clear as can be. Walter, surnamed the son of the first Walter, went on a Cru- sade, and was captured and put to death by the Saracens, in 1251., It is known in the family that he had a son by one of   54         NEVER k  , A I GA HV. those marriages common then, and which we are coming to now--a kind of limited liability concern-a marriage pro tn  -with an Arabian princess. Well, at his death there was no one to look after the child, and it was taken in charge by-an  English Knight and brought home to England. From him t came the Prynnes, who frequently intermarried with the best blood in England, until the time of James and his son' when William Prynne, the lawyer and political writer, got into trouble, had his ears cut off by sentence of the famous Star  Chamber, and the name made an object of suspicion. Our direct ancestor, a cousin of William, was Sir Cantlon Prynne, an immensely rich merchant, who sent out large fleets to the coast of Guinea, from whence he got the name of Guinea Prynne, and then in the troubles of the great revolutioni his descendants lost their money and also the last half of the name, their real name, and became Ginnys. Then followed i the emigration to America and the phonetic change of G to H in the word Hinny. So that, although she was called Kate I Hinny, her real name was Catherine de Brienne. Of course she has a perfect right to style herself la Princesse de Sicile ed Comntesse d'.lpulia. So she says, and I don't know any law to prevent her. "But, as I was saying, it is not with English fashionable society that I would compare ours and call it altogether a humbug, but it is with itself and its own pretensions, or rather with society as should be and easily might be. The only ex. cuse, I take it, for the existence in this country of a set or sets pretending to be at the head of social life, is that they really fulfil certain important functions ; that they really offer a higher standard of elegance and culture; that they really encour- age an improvement in manners and stimulate the growth and spread of refined taste. That is their only raison d'tre. If they do not do that, their exclusiveness is an insolent preten-  siton; a contemptible humbug; a big bag of nothing; a bladcl der that every decent man and woman ought to kick till it bursts. 'But, my dear  Mrs. Stichen, I must go now," continued    E VE R AGAIN.         549 Mr. Boggs, rising from his chair. "I am making you a very long visit. I will come again and hear your complaints about society. You must be getting a little tired of it all-you have been going it so strongly this last year." "Oh, I am very, very tired of it," replied Mrs. Stichen.' "Do you know, Mr. Boggs, that I think that I ought to have been an artist?" "Oh, my dear Mrs. Stichen, you have been reading Ruskin." "How can you think so? I'm sure he would frighten all such fancies out of my head. No, I have been reading the life of Madame Le Brun. I thought I would try a little." "In oil?' "Oh! no no.' I am not so bold as that; but I had an idea that I might have more of a talent for modelling. So I sent for some clay, and got Lucca to come and give me two or three lessons, and show me how to set things up. My model is rather restive, and I have to watch my chances; fortunately, I know his head so well that I can work while he is away. Will you see it? Touch that bell on the table." Mr. Boggs obeyed, and instantly the little negro appeared in the doorway leading to the back rooms of the suit. "Tell the waiter to go into the bath-room and get me the board with the clay bust upon it." "I'se bring it, Missis." No, I can't trust you, it is too heavy; but you can see that John brings it with great care; no shaking, mind." "How long," demanded Mr. Boggs, "since you have taken to this line?" "Oh, ever since my last reception. My room had been jammed, you recollect; the old folks had come and gone, and all had eaten and drunken, and the young folks, who staid for the German, had danced themselves out, and I stood alone. Don't start; I am pot going to quote Moore!s lines, but I sat down and thought to myself, what does it all amount to? Stichen put his honest old head into the door, and said, 'Don't mope, Lizzie ; it's no use; can't help it,   550        NE VER AGA IN. perhaps. I can't always,; cleared fifty thousand on Wabash to-day; made me feel very dull. Life is a game, Lizzie.' I thought he was going to say, ' Play well your part, there all the honor lies,' but he doesn't know Pope. He said, 'Life is a game. I think you play it about as fairly as most -of 'em, and when the time comes, I don't believe you need be afraid to pass in your chips,-if I know anything about the Being who keeps the bank.' I laughed. I know he didn't mean any profanity by his figure, and I told hitn I wasn't thinking of the future,-it was the present that bothered me. Stichen went off to bed, and I sat and thought and thought, and the result was, that I sent off for some clay the next morn- ing. One must do something, you know, except to dress and go to balls and opera, and all that." Poor Mrs. Stichen! exclaims some one. Could she not have occupied herself in her religious duties? Could she not have fully employed her time and her money in acts of benefi-  cence? And how do you know that she did not, in such mat- ters, come up very nearly, if not quite, to the mark of her high calling, as a rich, fashionable, Christian woman? I have said nothing to the contrary. I only say what I think; and what Mr. Boggs thought, but couldn't say, that if she had had a nice family of children to look after, she never Wyould have under- taken to model Stichen's bust. The servant brought the thing in, and lifted the water- proof hood, disclosing a most wonderful likeness. "Stichen himself," exclaimed Mr. Boggs. "But you have made him look too handsome. You have idealized too much." "No, he looks like that to me. I see all that I have put there, in him." Mr. Boggs took a long, steady look, and as he looked an undefined feeling grew, and grew, until it expanded into a full blaze of jealousy. Jealous of Stichen? Bah! and yet if his wife really saw him in that light-and perhaps, after all, that was the real light in which to look at his common and comical mug-the feeling might not be so unwarranted or ridiculous. Mr. Boggs almost repented himself of any forbearance in   NEVERP A GAIN.         551 the case. Yes, he would, he certainly would make what no one knew better how to make, earnest, but cool, crafty, unsc u- pulous, and irresistible love. And yet what nonsense, to knock under to the devil so soon; and When he had just resolved to resist him to the uttermost! Would it be right?-would it be generous?-would it be honorable? Some of us, occupying that vantage-ground of virtue which gives us the undoubted right to denounce-shall I say the vani- ties and follies? oh no, worse than that-the crimes and vices of fashionable life, may well doubt whether a society-man could stop to ask himself such questions. But the statement is strictly true, and, perhaps, in the interests of art, a pity 'tis 'tis true, for no one cares for a tale with not a real villain in it, and Mr. Boggs would have been so much more interesting, so I much more shocking and horrid, and every way a more satis- factory character, as the unscrupulous and successful lover of Mrs. Stichen. Mr. Boggs seized his hat and stick, forced himself to a little flourish about art, made his adieus in his usual style, and rushed into the street, "D-n the thing," he exclaimed to himself, but in quite an audible tone. "I wish it was night and the row had begun. I hope to heavens those fellows will show fight, and give us a bloody good time of it." You don't think that is very elegant language for the ele- gant Mr. Boggs! You don't, eh? Wait, my dear sir, until you are in a similar case, with the fiend tugging and jerking at your heart-strings, and trying to trip you up, and let us know, then, how nicely you choose words, or how delicately you let off pent-up feeling.   CHAPTER XXX. The Amateur Police at Work-Reconnoitring-The Fight-Madame Steignitz found. 'T HE evening set in dark, dismal, and gusty. The wind was not so very strong, but it came in puffs, and howled horribly. The phenomenon of cats and dogs is generally sup- posed to accompany only the rain. It did not rain, but cats and dogs, and a variety of wild animals, could be distinctly heard in the blast. It did not rain, but it threatened to do so before morning. And that was just the observation made by Mr. Whoppers, as, with his three companions, he started from Miss Jones' board. ing-house to go round to the house in Wooster Street. "Itdon't rain, but the fellows above have clearly got out their water-pitchers, and they'll pitch it into us before morn- ing. There, don't you hear that? It says as plainly as ever did a top-floor lodger in the olden time, 'Look out, below there --gare 'eau. '" "It won't rain till the wind gets a little more southing in it," said the Captain, looking up at the dark, scudding masses of cloud. "Well, I'm glad of that. I hope the southing will stay at home for a while. Just now it would make those slates slip- pery. I don't want to be presented with my last account on one of them. I can wait for death. I have no desire to be trans/ated." Mr. Boggs, with Luther, went on and entered the house. The Captain and Mr. Whoppers followed in a few moments, after first passing and repassing the length of the block, and   NE VEAR A GA IN.  making a thorough reconnoissance of the suspected house, and satisfying themselves that not a ray of light came from any of the front rooms. Luther holding the door ajar, they slipped in without notice, apparently, from any one. ILi fact, at that -time of the evening, and the weather threatening rain, there were but few passers, and no loungers, in the street-the neigh- boring grog-shops had too many attractions. Further consultation was unnecessary, and the only addi- tional preparation was on the part of the Captain. He had brought with him, in his hand, a coil of half-inch rope. This he deliberately proceeded to wind around his- waist in several turns. Luther held the candle, and all looked on inquiringly. "I never knew the harm," said the Captain, " of having a piece of rope about you. That is, about your body. I don't mean about your neck. That can't he so pleasant." Mr. Whoppers, for once, neglected to put in any jocular remark; and the party crept carefully upstairs, lighted by one solitary candle, which did little more than break the gloom of the deserted house into masses of dark shadows, which darted in and out of the empty rooms, and stalked along the halls, and ran up and down the stairs in a very weird and ghost-like manner. The rickety stairs creaked and groaned at every step; a party of rats, cut off by this unexpected inva- sion of their premises from their retreat in the cellar, scamp- ered about in every direction, squeaking their anger and dis- may. The ill-fastened and ill-fitted windows, and broken- slatted venetian blinds rattled and flapped, as if a thousand angry spirits of the air were knocking for admission. And enter some of them did, through a broken pane over the front door, and made a desperate attack upon the light that Luther carried. "Where is our lantern? A candle is not the thing for this kind of work," muttered the Captain. "Oh! here it is, safe in my pocket," replied Mr. Boggs; 'but I thought we would not light it until we need it in the other house." "Well, heave ahead then;" and the party pushed open   554        INEVER A GA IN. the attic door, and entered the room-Luther first securing his candle in the outer garret, so that its light should not be seen from the street, or the flame be extinguished bv the rush of air from the open window. It was no difficult thing to creep out upon the low-pitched roof; Luther leading, as he was the lightest and most agile; the Captain following, with sailor-like activity; then Mr. Boggs, and then Mr. Whoppers. It was not difficult to creep up, slowly and carefully, to the ridge of the roof; but it would be absurd to suppose that men resolved on desperate purpose could attain such a position, furtively, noiselsssly creeping- creeping-and crouching under the shelter of murky night, without some little elevation of feeling; without some slight quickening of the heart's contractions; without a certain increased activity of the imagination; without that slight degree of apprehension that touches--just touches-the border-land of fear, but is quite consistent with perfect coolness. How many a gallant fellow has felt it, mounting into almost an agony of pleasure, in night assaults or cuttings-out. Just fancy the stealthy step,-the low "Hist,-tread carefully men,-no noise in the ranks! close up! close up!"-and then the rush, and the wild ringing shout,-the clash of steel,--the livid flashes,- the rattle of musketry,--and the groans! Oh yes, don't leave out the groans from the picture. Or, in another case, the restless sea, panting and sighing, as dark night settles down upon its bosom-the soft swish of the boats at each impulse from vigorous arms--the low chafing of the muffled oars-the orders in bated breath-the occasional splash--"Take care, you   lubber-feather your oar more smoothly-you  have alarmed them!--they hear us!-they see us!-give way, my hearties!--pull, men!-pull your d--dest!-hurrah!"-and then the wild scramble up the sides and over the bulwarks, with pistols and blunderbusses flashing in your face, and a dozen pike-heads thrusting and picking away at your very eyes! I  declare, as I sit now before the flickering fire, in dress- ing-gown and slippers, with a mild Havana in my mouth, and    VER AGAIN.         555 with the option of a little old Golconda or Blackbourn, in case of necessity, and critically) examine and estimate matters from at position whichl any one must admit is eminently favorable i for a calm judgment, I cannot conceive any pleasure in life i greater, unless, it may be, that of a good, bold, daring burglary. However, it would not, perhaps, be best to speak too strongly on this point. Burglary, in the abstract, may be delightful, but yet in practice lack some ofthe charms with which an ardent imagination invests it. The ideal burglar is, in fact, rare; and the actual burglar may, perhaps, necessarily, take such a business view of things, and have his mind so closely set upon hisprospective swag, as to be precluded many of the finer and more aesthetical emotions. Slowly and noislessly the party worked its way over the intervening roofs-each one hiding himself as much as he I could from any possible view' from the street, by crouching j low on the back slope of the roo'. "Keep down, Whoppers," whispered Mr. Boggs;" you'll certainly be seen.  Devil take it, man, did you never stalk a deer?" "Oh dear, -no; you're the fellow to stalk the dears. But you're right; '1'll stalk behind thee like a witches' fiend pressing to be employed.' And, by-the-by, that reminds me I've got a conundrum." -"Oh, d-n your conundrums!" "Well, then, I won't put it in that form. A simple obser- vation merely, which, as a member of the Traveller's Club, you will appreciate. , This would be safer work on the roof of some house in Holland." "Pshaw! They are all ten times as steep." "Yes, but then they are used to storks." Mr. Boggs' smothered objurgation, with a faint chuckle from the Editor, was borne away upon a gust, that compelled them all to lie flat and motionless until it had passed. Arrived at the right house, Luther, according to agreement, crept down first to examine the windows, and to make sure that there was no one in the rooms. Cautiously he put I    55,f        NVE VER A CGAN. his head around the window frame, so as to look within. He recollected the glimpse that he had got of the horrible visage looking into the window   of Madame Steignitz, room, and at first he was very careful not to expose too much of his own face. Gradually he leaned forward until he could command the entire view. "'Dark as Erebus," he mut- tered. He could see nothing, but slowly the darkness melted 4little, and he fancied that he could see the outlines sufficiently to make sure that the room was empty. Still, he looked, and listened, and waited. There could be no doubt of it; at any rate he would try the window. He crept around in front, supporting himself with his feet in the gutter. He could not help a slight shudder when he thought what a nice mark he must now present for a pistol-shot from within the room, or how easy it would be for a strong man to suddenly throw up the window and push him into the court below. ,Twisting himself around so that he could use his hands freely, he tried the window. "I suppose we shall have to force it," he muttered. "It would be too good luck to find it unfastened." It resisted at first, but readily gave way to a little more force. He pushed it up to its catch, and stepped into the room, which was of the usual size and pattern, and entirely empty. Luther listened intently. He fancied that he heard the noise of voices, and he was going to open the door leading into the garret, when he suddenly bethought him that the rush of air down stairs from the open window might give an alarm. He had better get back and summon his comrades before going further. But first he must examine the adjoining window and room. This examination, made with the same precautions, resulted in the conviction that it, too, was unoccupied, but, the window being more securely fastened, he was unable to enter. A good half hour, and more, had been spent in these preliminary explorations, and the party above were getting a i*tsi -R *-'swwh^, niiiiniqiiiiiiiiimmimi-iii^-^  * -  '    NEVET1VER AGAIN.        557 little impatient, especially as the temperature was falling, and the weather growing quite "shivery," as Mr. Whoppers called it. "I say, Captain," and the Captain had to stretch himself with difficulty by Mr. Boggs in order to catch Mr. Whoppers communication. "I say, Captain, you need not say ' shiver my timbers' up here." "Pshaw! I never do talk such nonsense." "Well, don't you do it. It isn't necessary, for if we wait here much longer, what with the fright and cold, my timbers will shiver themselves. Ah, there is Luther, and it's high time up here--the highest time I've seen in a long time. So you got into the dormer? Well, we thought you had got into the dormant, too, you staid so long." ' Do stop your everlasting chatter." "Can't! It's the weather--the confounded thing chatters of itself, whether or no; but lead on, I'll slope after you." The party quietly slid down the roof, and following Luther through the open window, entered the room. A moment or two they stood listening. No alarm in any quarter-not even a window raised in any of the five or six intervening houses-not a sound except the noise of the wind and the beating of their own hearts. 'The window was carefully closed, and Mr. Boggs-produced his lantern, but the difficulty was to light it without'sending a glimmer through the glass. Luther, with ready invenitiveness, whipped off his coat, and placing the lantern on the floor, threw the coat over it. Under this effectual cover he succeeded in striking a match and lighting the wick with hardly the escape of a single ray. And now for the door, which proved to be locked from the further side. Fortunately the lock was on the inside, and was one of the commonest kind. Luther was prepared for the emergency. The slightest gleam of the lantern showed two screws holding the bolt-latchet. He produced a screw-driver, and in half a minute they were out, the bolt free, and the door slowly and carefully opened.   558        NEVER AGAIN. . Nothing but a wide, open, and empty garret, with a narrow pair of stairs leading down to the floor below. Cautiously, but not without a creaking of the loose boards, they crept to the head of the stairs and listened. There were sounds of voices, evidently men's voices, and they seemed to come up from the parlor floor; and there was an occasional sound, like a woman's voice, that apparently came from the first floor below. A feeble glimmer of light, so faint as barely to reveal the intensity of the darkness, seemed to come from some one of the rooms on the same floor. A  consultation, and it was decided that Luther should again go on first and reconnoitre. "Give me time enough this time," he whispered, "and don't you begin to be impatient under half an hour at least." "Take your time, Miss Lucy," hummed quite audibly Mr. Whoppers, and would perhaps have continued in a louder tone if he had not felt Mr. Boggs' powerful fingers closing upon his arm with no gentle force. The lighest step could not have prevented the rickety stairs from creaking, but fortunately the wind made all kinds of com- mingling noises. Arrived at the last step--all was silent on that floor. Even the glimmer of light had disappeared, and he was compelled to slightly raise the slide of his lantern to show him the turn of the stairs going down to the parlor floor, and to let him see if there was any obstruction in his path. He leaned over the railing, and looked down into the dark hall, and listened. Decidedly, there were men in the parlor. He could hear their voices distinctly. They were speaking in quite loud tones. He could almost distinguish the words. He heard the clink of glasses, and there was a. strong odor of tobacco pervading the air. He must venture down, and try and make out something from their conversz+ion' that might serve as a clue. As he desdended, the voices became louder. The con versation was evidently growing moore animated, and the tone; less muffled and indistinct. He stopped mid-way on the l/mm,.-A-..    NEk VER AGAIN.         559 stairs just where his head cleared the ceiling, and leaned across the ballusters, He could almost reach across the nar- row hall, and touch the door. "Bah!" exclaimed a voice that Luther could not recog nize as belonging to either of the three, with which he was familiar. "You should have consulted me : I could have told you that there could be no magot. This is not the countr- for that thing--I don't believe she ever trusted herself with . dollar over night. Everything she has is invested, or deposi- ted, and if you had her bank-book, or a check signed by her- self, it would do no good. You couldn't get a dollar on it. It is too late." A jumble of oaths, exclamations, and questions followed, amid which Luther recognized the deep voice of the one they called Brochu.                 j "Why?" replied the first speaker. "I'll tell you why-- because they have all been warned of her disappearance. That young fellow has been busy with the police, you admit. Do you suppose he has not put her bankers and brokers on their guard?" "Sacre matin!" ejaculated Brochu. " ye regerai maon compte avec cet brouilon Id." "EFZice avec tes menaces en P'air!" exclaimed the v ice of Monsieur Ricord. "We have enough to do to get out of this scrape. We can't put her back again." "No, and if we did we should all be arrested in [twenty- four hours. She's vindictive, that old witch. I think I should prefer Cayenne again to Sing Sing." "' The thing is simple enough," rejoined the first sneaker. "She's almost dead already! Well then"-and the voices assumed so low a tone that Luther could only catch now and then a word. But those words were enough to outline a pic- ture that fancy readily filled up. C'est bien facile-coupe de Monsieur le Docteur--une malade-conmprenez-dedans.-vite- au bout-cinquantinme rue-une fois-dans l'eau--est fini. Demain soir? Non! none!--p as de temps (peerdre." Such were the words that came to Luther's ear, mingled   -560        NEVER AGAIN. with a good many others which he could not have distin-. guished, perhaps, even if they had been in English. But he had heard enough to make his heart beat still quicker, and to start the big beads of sweat upon his brow. A fierce oath from Brochu, and a sudden slapping down of his glass upon the marble mantel-piece, arrested the con. versation for an instant. "So it comes to this--we are to have all this trouble for nothing," he exclaimed. "The cursed old witch! I don't mind making an end of her, but who wants to run so much risk and get nothing for his pains? It's all very well for Monsieur Ricord here, who loses only his famous gun, or for the Doctor, who may have to put off presenting his com- pliments at the 'brickyard,' but for me-I lose everything. Murder is too cheap when it's done for nothing at 11." "Hush! you use ugly words, my friend. There is no use in getting provoked. It is too late to go back now, and the thing can be made to pay yet if we work it right." "How so? ' "W Why, don't you see, as long as she lives we can get no money, but once dead, and her body fished up out of the river, we can manufacture an heir. It will take a little time, it is true, but it can be done. She hasn't a relation in the world-no one to contradict us, unless it may be that young fellow, and if he gets in the way, why we must knock him out of it, if we have to knock his head off to do it." "I see. The thing is feasible, but there are difficulties." "Certainly, there are always difficulties, but they can be got over. I have a nephew, a dirty little blackguard, but he'd make a good heir for the old one. Listen now," and there was some movement and a shuffling of feet, and Luther con- cluded that the party had drawn closer together, especially as the voices fell, and the conversation came to his ear so indis- tinctly that he could make nothing of it further. He drew back from his uncomfortable position and straight- ened himself up.  What should he do? It was time for him to go back to the garret, but he had not as yet received the ,   NEVER AGAIN.          561 slightest indication as to the room in which Madame Steignitz must be confined. Perhaps, however, she was not in the house, and yet where else could she be? She must be found, and that at once. There was clearly no time to be lost. A night, an hour, might seal her fate. Luther could hardly keep himself from groaning out. He could have shouted aloud in his agony of impatience and apprehension. He felt a desperate impulse to daAh himself against the door behind which the conspirators were concoct- ing tleir foul plans, but he restrained himself with effort. He controlled the tension of his muscles, straining to explode into immediate and unwise action. He set his teeth, and shrank himself in upon himself, as it were, to confine the sense of intense, powerful anxiety that threatened each instant to over- master sense and will. What should he do? If he went back to his companions- what should--what could--he tell them to do? He turned, and made a step or two upward. This brought his head on a level with the floor above. Ha! there was that glimmer of light again. The light he had first seen, upon reaching the stairs above. Luther stopped, and bent his head to the floor, and waited and watched. Faint and wavering, but still distinct, it marked its track from beneath the door of the small hall room, at the back of the house. And now the light had passed into the adjoining large room, and gleamled through the ventilating window over the door. It came in flashes, and was evidently carried with an effort at concealment in a lantern. But the brightest flash was so feeble, that had not Luther's eyes been rendered unusually sensitive by the long darkness they had been enduring, it might almost have-passed unnoticed. If that door should open now, he would clearly be caught between two fires, or rather two lights, and. be cut off from the stairway leading to the attic. But, at any and all risks, he must know what was in that room. Once make sure. that Madame Steignitz was in there, and the course was plain. 36   562        NEVEER AGAIN. z They would make a rush, burst in the door, secure the old [i woman, and while one of them carried her up and off over the roof, the other three could defend the stair-head, even if there were half-a-dozen or more men, as Luther suspected, in the parlor below. The fight could not last long, however desperate the conspirators. They would be afraid of alarmn ing the police, and of being taken in the rear. It is useless to say that Lutlher's step was stealthy. His H feet had been slippered for the purpose, and even a careless step could have made no noise that would not have been drowned in the rattling of the loose windows, and the flap- ping and creaking of the broken blinds.         He gained the door. There was no crack, and through the key-hole he could see nothing. There were but two ways; either open the door and look in, or take a look through the ventilating-window above. The door was probably locked, and any attempt upon it would give a prematulre alarmn. The moulding above the door was broad, strong, and just  within reach of his fingers. Luther was a good gymnast, and he found no difficulty in drawing himself up without touching the door with toe or knee,  and holding himself steadily for more than a minute in a posi- tion to command a good view of all in the room.  A common tin lantern, with a candle in it, stood upon the E mantel. There was no other place for it to stand, as the room I was destitute of furniture-not a chair or table-nothing but  one low wooden bench, standing'nearly in the middle of the room, and a  heap of bedding, or a pile of old clothes, either,  or perhaps both, in one corner.  - -Upon the bench sat a woman, with one elbow on her knee,  and supporting her'head with her hand, while the other arm  fell listlessly by her side. She was dressed in a light-blue silk. A  stronger light would probably have shown that it had seen much service, but it would also have shown that it  fitted nicely, and had been cut in good style. A stronger  light would have shown that the black hair had been coiffed I with a  strange care and art, for the occupant of such a miser    NEVE R AGAIAN.         563 able, empty house, and vacant room, but, as it was, the gleam from the open door of the lantern, falling full upon her face, revealed to Luther's sharp eyes enough to excite his wonder and curiosity. She was not handsome-perhaps never had been, although that hollow cheek, and those pinched features might once have been attractive, and, assisted by the gleam of bright eyes and the flash of white teeth, the whole face might have been piquant and interesting. It would have been difficult for a man more experienced in women's ways than Luther to have judged of her age. She might be thirty--perhaps five years older-perhaps two or three years less. Who can tell the age of a Frenchwoman who has passed her fifth lustrum? She sat motionless, lost in revery, and her thoughts, it was plain to see, were not pleasant. How could they be? It needed no remorse-no stings of conscience, to make them bitter. The accidents of fortune, the hard contrasts of now and then, were enough to excite the mingled emotions of regret, despair, and hate. The very contemplation of past joys sometimes fills the soul with bitterness. Should we wonder that one who has passed through the various stages of demi-monde life can hardly contain herself when sitting forlorn, surrounded only by bare walls, in a miserable house in Wooster Street, and thinking of her dearly loved Paris, and all its pleasures? When thinking of her first engagement at the Caf6 Chantant in the Champs Elysde, when she sang her "Me voici /-une autre pucelle D'Orleans,  after Therese had given her Femme d barbe, and -always got a round of applause ; or when thinking of the drives in the Bois; and the excur- sions to Vincennes; and balls at the Opera; and the jolly little dinners here, there, and everywhere ; and that par- ticular supper in that little entresol cabinet of the Cafr An- glais, when she made Larken,-the rich young American, who had not much money, b u t who luckily had less brains, and who, by dint of a jumbling up of the ideas of income and prin- cipal, contrived for a few months to raise a very considerable ripple on the surface of a certain portion of Parisian society o    564        ArE EVER AC IN.           -when she made him prolmisse to fake her on that trip to Baden and Homburg, where lie lost thrl-e hundred thousand francs, and the Director of the play gave hm twenty firancs to take them to Frankfort, where she sold her diamond pin for the rest of their journey to Paris,-and then, oh, then, came a step down the ladder! but, oh, the mad delights of Mabille and Valentino;' and now this stupid country, with poverty, ill health, and the brutal companionship of Monsieur Brochu. Luther hung, bat-like, by his finger-tips in silence; con. templating this apparently only person in the room. But suddenly the bundle of bedding stirred in the corner, a} arm was thrust out with a feeble moan, and the conviction darted on his mind that there lay the object of his search. The body there in the corner, of course, could belong to no one else. He  still waited an instant, although his fingers, strong and supple as they were, were on the point of failing him.  The young woman started at the moan, and turned her head towards the corner, but did not rise from her seat. "Let her die," she muttered in French. "I can do noth- ing for her; and why should I? it is best so. Ah,- mo0 DieuV, I almost wish I were in her place." At this instant Luther was startled by a sudden flash of light directly behind him, and simultaneously a heavy step and a  muttered oath. His hands completely benumbed, he dropped to his feet and turned himself around; and there, at the head of the stairs in front of him, at some ten feet distance, stood a man with a lantern, the light of which he had directed full upon Luther's person while he was yet hanging to the casing of the door. The dark figure, that of a large and powerful man, was clearly outlined, but the face was hidden in the shadow of  the lantern; and more than that, Luther's eyes- were dazzled by the sudden glare. The next moment and the door behind him opened, and the-woman whom he had been observing stood behind him with the candle in her hand, and the additional light at once B -  ----         , .   ANl' 7VER AGAIN.        565 revealed the repulisi-e and deeply marked visage of Monsieur Brochu. A few guttural sounds, like the gruntings of an enraged boar wlhen about to make a charge, came from between the clenched teeth. But still he moved not, and Luther had time to draw his club and prepare for an attack. "It is you, ha! I know you, young one! I have an account to settle with you! You have been trying to put the police on my heels, and now you come here as a spy, eh? You know the fate of a spy-of a burglar-of a thief?" And suddenly the speaker withdrew his hand from his pocket grasping a revolver, and levelled; it at the young man's heart. The movement was rapid, but not so rapid as thought, and Luther had time to think what a fool he had been not to have closed with him before. But it was too late. "Back, Lizzette, back; out of my line," hissed Brochu. It took but an instant to utter the warning to his mistress, but an instant rightly used is sometimes the turning-point between life and death! With the rapidity of lightning, Luther flung back his arm, grasped the woman, swung her round in, front of him, and the next minute had jumped backward through the doorway into the room. Uttering a horrible imprecation, Monsieur Brochu made a step or two in advance. At that instant a smart blow on his hand from a club behind him, knocked the pistol from his grasp, and the next instant a crack on the crown brought him to his knees, but he was still able to grapple with his assailant, the Captain, who was no ways backward in accept- ing the invitation to close quarters. Both were powerful men, and the struggle might have been indefinitely pro- longed, or have ended only in blood, as Brochu was striving desperately to get atIis knife, if Luther had&not come to the assistance of the Captain. "Hold on-to-his 'starboard fin-Luth-for an instant -and I'll-get--eh-eh-this noose on his left-and we'll gasket-him up so tight-that-there-ugh-ugh--" and the  . -.---   566         NVEER  GAIX.        I Captain tugged, and talked, and grunted,-" so tight that he may blow as much as he pleases, and he won't be able to  show an inch of sail." And suiting the action to the word, the Captain whipped off the rope from around his own body, and coiled it, and knotted, and double knotted it about tihe arms, wrists, and legs of the struggling giant, with a rapid dex. terity that no one but a trained seaman could have equalled. And all this time Lizzette stood looking on, as rigid as a cataleptic, and holding the candle aloft as if her sole business vas to light up the battle-ground, which, illuminated alone by Brochu's lantern, would have been gloony enough. As they finished, and Luther jumped away to join in the terrible imdee that was going on behind them, a tremendous crash of ballus.. ters and staircase was added to the infernal din arising from the desperate struggles of powerful men in so narrow a space. At the first loud oath from Brochu, the party assembled in  the parlor below had sallied into the hall. At the instant the Captain-had struck the pistol, which exploded as it fell  they made a rush for the stairs. The large man known as the Doctor had succeeded in reaching the last step, when Mr. Boggs made a blow at him with his club, but the slope of the stairs was in the way, and it was ineffectual, and the next moment they had their hands on each other's throats. In the meantime, three or four men' were pressing their way up stairs, but Mr. Whoppers was just in time. Swinging himself over fronm mid-way of the staircase above, he alighted on the hall railirg for an instant, and from that coign of van- tage dealt a heavy kick under the chin to the foremost, turn- ing him over upon his companions, and sending them all down in a pile at the bottom of the stairs. Again they attempted a rush, but Whoppers kicked so desperately, and struck out with his club so fiercely, and jumped about so nimbly, and sputtered and swore, and quoted poetry--something about "How can a man die better than fighting against odds, For the temples of his fathers, and the ashes of his gods," that they were beaten back, or held at bay.   NE VER AGAIN V        567 And so the struggle between Mr. Boggs and the Doctor went on. But not for long. The reader must recollect that the whole affair hardly occupied two minutes. There are few positions in which men improve the time more faithfully than on such an occasion, and a good deal of hard fighting, if it is to the death, can be done in a short time. At the instant Luther, followed by the Captain, freed himself from the grasp of the now prostrate and corded Brochu, and dashed to the assistance of his companions, Mr. Boggs had forced his antagonist against and partially over the railing of the stairs, and had succeeded in liberating his right hand and planting two or three heavy blows directly in his opponent's face, when suddenly the railing gave way, and over both went head first on to the stairs. Two or three men were borne down by this tremendous avalanche of humanity, and underneath the accumulated weight the staircase gave way on one side and they all rolled into the hall below together. This was the turning-point of the fight, and all of the con- spirators who could, gathered themselves up as quickly as possible and rushed for the street door, leaving the Doctor in the grip of Mr. Boggs, who, even in going head first down the stairs, had never loosened his hold. The light streamed into the hall from the open parlor door and showed that the Doctor was insensible. Leaving Mr. Whoppers to guard Brochu and to prevent the woman at- tempting to liberate him, the Captain clambered down the broken staircase, and in a moment the Doctor was so securely corded that, with returning animation, he had no power to renew the fight. Mr. Boggs had evidently suffered the most of any of his party. His coat was hanging by shreds-his shirt-bosonl had disappeared entirely, and his face was deeply marked. "Am I hurt much? Why no, I can't say that I am," said Mr. Boggs, and, giving himself a shake, " no bones broken, I believe. Ugh e Where can all this blood come from?" he exclaimed, wiping his face. "I guess I'm pretty well marked.. Shan't be able to show for some time. But I don't mind    that. It's my hand that is the worst. I've mashed it up sc on that fellow's head, that I don't believe I'll be able to tou; the piano for six months." "All right!" shouted Luther, who had darted up-stais, and, seizing the candle which Lizzette held in her hand, lad rushed to the corner of the room where lay the pile of old clothes on which he had noticed a movement. A haggard figure supported itself on its wasted arm, in a feeble effort to assume a sitting posture; a pair of piercing black eyes gleamed out from the wan and pinched face. Luther would have known the eyes of Madame Steignitz, even if no other feature had been recognizable. As he knelt by her side, those eyes fairly blazed like black diamonds in a death's-head. She seized his hand, and her voice rose almost into a shriek: "Oh, mort Dieu, que vols etes bon j C'est mon peit. Yes, it is it is my little one. X knew you would come, I was sure of it. I knew  the good God would not let them kill me until I had seen you. TheI wanted my money, and they starved me and beat me, but I said 'No, I will have it all-all-every dollar for my little one.' Oh, but God is good to me.  Yes, yes, God is a good God.   I thank Him. I thank Him." Thle old woman's grasp relaxed, and she fell back utterly exhausted. "All right!" shouted Luther. "I have found her; but she is dying; what shall we do? I must run for a doctor."  "Hold on!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers.   "Guard this fellow, and I'll run round to the police-station; I know the Captain. I'll have him here with some men to secure our captives in five minutes, and I'll bring a police-surgeon with me. Here, take this claap's pistol, and don't hesitate to blow his brains out if he gets an arm loose; and look out for the girl-she looks dazed and harmless now, but she may give trouble yet." Mr. Whoppers had not far to run. There was a  crowd the:door there was the patrol squad upon the steps. For   a block or two, up and down, the whole street was in alarm, and before the police could get in and close the door, there was a reporter, note-book in hand, elbowing his way through the crowd. A reinforcement of police arriving, all intruders were expelled, Brochu and the Doctor unpinioned and, with Liz zette, marched off to the station. The girl had not uttered a word-had hardly moved from her first position, at the beginning of the fight. She had been astonished and frightened into absolute silence. As they led her off, she seemed like one in a dream. Poor thing! One cannot help feeling sorry for her. She might be guilty, might be degraded, but her fate was nevertheless a hard one. Hard to be forced step by step down the gradients of Pa- risian life, and then to this dull, stupid country, where they don't speak French, and there is no Mabille, no Jardin des Fleurs, nothing--notng-g-but the Black Crook! A little brandy and water was the first prescription of the police-surgeon, andd Luther darted down to the French restaurant, estaminet et salle de billard, on the corner. "Non, non, you sall no run away with my tumbler," shouted the keeper of the den, as Luther started for the door. "There then," and the young man threw back a ten- dollar bill as he sprang out into the street. An idea struck him; he turned, put his head back into the room, and shouted: "Get a bowl of soup ready; keep the change if the soup is ready in five minutes. I wilf be back after it." The bar-keeper was morose and tired, and the dirty waiters, and the greasy billiard-markers worn out and sleepy, as it was now past twelve o'clock, but there was something in the tone in which the order was given, and in the sight of the ten-dollar bill fluttering in the air, that electrified the whole establishment, and set them screaming in chorus, "Potage! Unpotage sec, unpotage allere." Perhaps the reader does not know what a dry soup or a   570        NE VER AGAN. thirsty soup is, and it is quite possible that the kitchens in Paris would plead guilty to similar ignorance, the term being nothing but Monsieur Grandbceuf's translation of New York eating-house slang, meaning a plate of soup to which an ex. tra glass of hot -water had not been added, as is usual, at the moment of serving, to insure a paying and proper degree of dilution and heat. It was a bright idea in Luther to order it, for after administering the brandy and water that was the very nex thing the Doctor suggested, and in less than ten minutes Luther produced it, hot, strong, and odorous, and Madams Steignitz was swallowing it with trembling voracity, and sensibly gaining in strength with every spoonful. "Can she be moved to night, Doctor?" demande Luther. The Doctor shook his head. "Oh yes,"'. cried Madame. "Don't leave me here ai hour. I must go out of this. I will go away from this. will get back once more to my room." '; But I am afraid to leave you in the old room alone." "No, no. I must go back. There is no danger for m -none. You have that horrible man safe in the prison. Bu if not he never try again. He know that he can not get tl money which I have save for my little one. Oh, mona Die, but I have been tempted. Ten thousand! If I woul promise just ten thousand dollar; but no, I would not, ar (" then he struck me with his fist, and then he whip me with cravache till my arms and back are all blood, and then he toi my hair, my poor gray hair, from my head, and then I he nothing to eat, and then nothing to drink--not a drop ( water for three whole days, but I w:ould not, I would not rc my little one, and I would not give such a villain a sou--p una sou. And now, oh, I must go. Oh! oh! I cannot st; here. I must to my home. Oh, take me away! take r away! The good God has sent you to take me away. I kne He would. Yes, yes, I knew He would. Blessed be E name!"   NE VER AGAIN.         571 There was nothing else to do, so Luther dashed down to the restaurant, and flourishing a handful of notes, a cane- seated arm-chair, and three or four pillows and blankets were produced in no time. It is wonderful how many activities a little money will set in motion. It is frequently said that such or such a thing cannot be had for love or money. The saying may be true; it probably is sometimes true. It is unquestionably true of many things as far as love is concerned, but just at this moment it is difficult to recall anything that a man can't get at any hour, even at midnight, in few York for money, if he has only plenty of it and knows where to go. Luther found upon his return that his companions had got back from the station, after seeing the prisoners fairly entered upon the police records, and locked in their cells. Madame Steignitz was at once lifted into her chair, and, K with a couple of police-officers and the surgeon, the prces sion started for her house. Luther, with the Captain, ran ahead to prepare the way, and in hope that he should find Mrs. Jolly, the nurse, at home and disengaged. He moun- ted the stairs, and knocked at her door two or three times; there was no answer. "She can't be in," said Luther from the head of the stairs. "How unlucky." "Knock again, my boy," responded the Captain. "Bang hard. She's a nurse, you know, and that sort always sleep sound. Yc  re no idea how much calling and knocking a genuine nutse will stand. -It's their business. They are brought up to it." Thus encouraged, Luther renewed his efforts, and at  lengt secured a response. Yes, Mrs. Jolly was at home, and disengaged, and for the double fees that Luther, with reckless prodigality, promised to pay out of his own pocket, was ready at once to do anything for anybody. The noise by this time had aroused all the inmates of the house, and as Madame Steignitz was carried up to her room, her tenants crowded the landings and halls, or pul their heads out of the half-opened doors, as if to welcome   572        NE VE RI A GAIN. her return. Not a very joyful welcome, as may be supposed, although there were none there who bore the old woman any personal ill-will ;- a sorrowful welcome in fact, if we may judge from some of the expressions. "' Lord preserve lus, Mrs. Flanigan, but it's she herself has come back to us. Ah, but the Lord is hard on us pool people." " Whist, woman, didn't I tell you so ?" "Ye did, but I didn't believe it. Her corse to the sod, and her sowl to God, was what I made sure of, and now here she comes, and me with a month's back rint on my mind." '"Ah, hush; don't .'mind her of it.  Ain't we all biling and bubbling in the same pot ?" "Remind her? Niver you fear, if I don't the devil vwill. Look at the eyes of her. They glimmer and shine like two holes in a blower." " Oh, you may say that, or like the peeps in a brick-kiln. And don't they say, I know every one of yees owes me a mdnth's rint, and I'll take it for breakfast to-morrow morning? Och! that I should come to be so defrauded. By my sowl it is enough to make one sick and tired of life. I say, Donegan, what are ye staring at? Did ye niver see the Madame before ?" "Indeed I have, thank God for His mercies ; but-" "And that was enough for ye, eh? Ye didn't want -to see her again? Well, you may say that, for indeed there is nothing enticing about her. Your wife knows you're o'er fond of gallivanting wid de young ones, but she'll trust yees to- morrow morning wid the ould one, whin ye go to her wid the rint in your hand. Go to bed, Donegan, and thank the divil for sending her back to comfort us once more." Some time after Madame Steignitz had been borne into her room, and left in charge of Mrs. Jolly, the conversation- was continued by little groups in the halls.- But gradually, comments and conjectures were exhausted, and the tenants went back to bed again, but not to sleep, or, if they did, most assuredly to dream of one of the heaviest and common- est afflictions of poor humanity-rent in arrears.    CHAPTER XXXI. ilells-The Big Thing Petroleum Compny--Mr- Ledge' i to til he Oil Regions--Whoppers and Luther visit West Point. I-E chief, and in fact the only well of the Pig Thing T Petroleum Company had suddenly stopped flowing. One of tPe greatest geol ogeuml curiosities of the Oil Region had ceased to be, and with it had gone ir. Ledgeral's last hope. Two hundred thousand dollars he had put in a  barren pieceral of ground, and dry well after dry well had repaid his liberal- tad hnore he bored, the less chance he had of shoving e ig Thing off, at   a proft of five hundred per cnt., upon a nice set of stockholders. To be ure, the was a pretty good well on the adjoining land. He might have bought that out, and laid a pipe from it to one of his dry wells, and then, letting her " head up at nihthave man- aged to pump out by day about forty barrels, and so have pumped in some greedy speculators, and thus at least have got his money back. But Mr. Ledgeral was no yillal ; i he had been, hoe never would have appeared in this book. He was a strictly honorable man, unfortunate in having been suddenly soused into a whirlpool of irresistibletemptation, * but not a man who would go deliberately to the current of rascality, and strip himself for a swim. He could not have done such a thing, and, besides, it was too late. The trick had been tried more than once, and in one instance with l success on two or three original " iers"-experienced fellows, who had bored holes themselves, and bought and sold fees ; I  land royalties, and rights and fractional interests, and floated half-a-dozen companies-fellows all over " ile," and as sleel '. * and slippery as a Greek gymnast just grease   574        NEVER A GA IN. It was too late then to do anything of that kind, even had Mr. Ledgeral been so disposed, which I am happy to say he was not. Such virtue could not go without reward, and one morning, the very next after Mrs. Ledgeral had started for West Point, he received a telegram announcing "The tubing all in. Seed-bag in place. Sucker rods just going down. Begin pumping in an hour." Not much hope had Mr. Ledgeral. He had received the same kind of announcement so often, and then a weary week's pumping and no oil, or just enough to grease the engine. At noon le received another telegram: "Plenty of salt water-a little oil, but increasing; shall get her up to five barrels at least." Five barrels! And Mr. Ledgeral threw the telegram into the waste-basket, and, leaning his elbows on the table, rested his head in his hands, and thought-and thought-oh such ugly and disagreeable thoughts; and what made the matter so bad and imparted an element of peculiar bitterness was the clearness with which he could see that if he only had time he would come out all right; and yet to ask for time, to barely hint at the necessity for that precious commodity, would be to overwhelm himself with ruin and disgrace. And then he thought of Helen, and how uncertain the scheme to which she was to be sacrificed, and that, even if successful, his character as a godly, church-going, honest, honorable man and merchant was at the mercy of a comparative stranger. And thus he thought, and thought. He thought all the; thoughts over and over again which for weeks he had been thinking over and over. In fact the one train of thought streamed through his mind with desperate pemtmacity, until he felt as if he should go crazy. But he did not go crazy. He got up and helped himself to a large glass of Bourbon, which diverted his mind, and his thoughts rambled a little. He thought, among other things, of all that had been said, pro and con, about suicide; and how absurd it is, even if a man has a right to take his own life, to do&so$.when he can not know but, by waiting a little, his pains and troubles may be relieved.   NEVER A GA IN.         575 And then as to the mode of suicide: That was a capital plan of Dr. Bignal, who, it is supposed, stood at his open window with a bottle of prussic acid , and with one move ment emptied its contents into his mouth, and jerked the bottle into the street. Whefi his body was found some time had elapsed--there was nothing but the faintest possible odor of bitter almonds, and a few fragments of a Class vial in the street--nothing for the coroner to go upon, and nobody but a few medical friends suspected that he had committed suicide. And Mr. Ledgeral thought of Uncle Shippen, who always had a plan for everything, fromn burglary to paying the national debt; frog flying in the air to reducing England to an uninhabitable island by taking away from her shores the Gulf Stream. The only difficulty in relation to this feat might be the impossibility of deciding whether it would be best to cut a channel across the Isthmus of Panama and let the current go through'that way, or whether it would be best to build a dyke between Florida and Cuba, and stop it altogether. "I'll tell you whlat, sir," said Uncle Shippen; "I could commit suicide, and I'd defy all the doctors in creation to find it out. There are fifty different ways. I'd do itwith chloroform. You see, I'd take a handkerchief, and tie a string to it, and lead the string through a little pulley on the mantel-piece, and so on to the clock-weight so that when the weight ran down it would pull the handkerchief into the fire and burn it up. Well, I would saturate the handkerchief wit chloroform, lie down, apply it to my nose, and half an ollur after the fire would remove all evidence, and the verdict couldn't be anything but 'Died by the visitation of God."' "Oh, no," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "They'd find scraps of burnt handkerchief and remnants of string, and they would string all together. They would see through itat once, and bring you infelo de se, and besides, you might want to kill yourself in summer, when there are no fires. Most suicides do, they say- 't o "Well, then, I'd try another way. I'd catch a cat-one   576         NE VER, AGAzN. of those wild fellows from off the back fences, then I'd tie a long string to her, and at the other end have some soft paper soaked in chloroform. Well, I'd open the window, lie dow, hold on to the cat with one hand, and apply the chloroform with the other, and when my grasp relaxed in death, away would bound the cat and take with her all evidence as to the manner of the deed.  What could they say to that?" "'Well, I don't know what the jury might say, but be sure I'd have your obituary in the Universe, under the head of awful (/astrop ihe6 Mr. Ledgeral had laughed at the time of this conversa. tion, and he smiled a little now as he thought of it. But the smile did not last long; still the train of cognate ideas did not go quite so easily. It is not a wholesome state of mind when a man is con. tinually turning over in his brain thoughts of suicide, although he may perhaps fully admit the wickedness' the awful and supreme  absurdity of the act, and although he continually says to himself that by no possibility could, he be guilty of such sin and folly. Relief from such dangerous thoughts, however, came at last, when later in- the day Mr. Ledgeral received another telegram  "Pumped five hours. Oil all the time increasing. Four o'clock, started to flow. Five hundred barrels, and gaining every minute. Will reachea thousand. All the tanks full, and oil running to waste." / Here was a   change. One single bound from the depths of despair to the heights of hope and joy! It may be imag- ined with what exultation Mr. Ledgeral packed his carpet- bag. He   was an honest man after all. He always thought so. How could he, a  proud New York merchant, one of the stateliest respectabilities of the city, ever have allowed him- self to fall into the dumps as he had? He knew enough of the exaggerations of the oil business not to rely on the esti- mate of a thousand barrels. But take it at one-half that quan- tity, and let it run one year-and it ought to last two-he was saved!   NE: VTER AGAIN.        5" In half an hour he was in the Erie train and on his way to Oil City. It was the lightning express, and on it rushed through the gloom of night, past town and hamlet, through tunnels and forests, across rivers and ravines, and ever- unfortunately for the poor stockholders-up hill and down dale; on it rushed, but hardly with the rapidity that Mr. Ledg- eral would have liked. If the Vings of hope so often talked of were only real bona fide flappable entities, he would'have stretched out, and left the train far behind. His spirit craned itself out over the road, beyond the locomotive, and at least ten seconds to the mile ahead of the time-table; his pec- toral and abdominal muscles were drawn into that painful state of constriction which accompanies and luckily controls Ahe yearning of the viscera for more motion, and which is not inaptly expressed by the phrase "feeling as if one could fly." Faster, faster, then! Never mind the broken rails, the mis- placed switches, the rotten ties and bridges, or the wandering cattle! There is something ahead worth any risk to see, even as a mere matter of curiosity-an oil-well spouting one thou- sand barrels a day!  Talk of the geysers of Iceland, the mud volcanoes of Mex- ico, the bubbling clay-cones of Modena, or the jets of flame ever springing from the field of Pietramala; they are all as nothing compared to that greatest geological mystery-a flow- ing oil-welt. Fancy a jet of oil springing suddenly, from a hole bored six hundred feet into the solid rock, and mounting fifty or sixty, or, as in the case of the great Phillips well, one hundred feet into the air. Again, and again, men rush at it with desperate determination to tube it, or plug it, until means can be applied to direct and control its flow. And again, and again, covered with oil, blinded by the spray of petroleum, and choked with the gas, they yield to the force of the jet, and the intense cold of the fluid, and are compelled to retreat. Hours, perhaps days, elapse before they succeed, and in the meantime all sur- rounding nature is 4dluged with oil. It lies ankle deep over acres of ground; it runs in streams into Oil Creek, and on to Z 37   578        NVE ER A GA4. I . the Alleghany, and spreads its iridescent pellicle clear to the Ohio. Everything is oil. The trees drip oil. It dribbles from derrick and engine-house. Clothing is soaked in oil. The air for miles is filled with its gas. You taste it; you smell it; you see it. You live in as dense an atmosphere of pure gas as you would were you a member of Congress. You wade in oil half way to your knees. You talk oil, think oil, dream oil. All creation seems turning into oil, and you wonder how long the continent of America will last, and how soon it will come the turn of Europe, and whether Africa will not run all into the black lubricating kind. And still she spouts-spouts as persistently as a woman's rights lecturer. Good Heavens! what if Nature has dosed the world for some of its colicky pains with oil, and the oil won't stay down; may we not anticipate a terrible writhing and twisting, when it has all been thrown up? Pardon me, my dear madam, if this idea has a smack of the shop. But an old M. D., you know, may take liberties; and besides, you have children--darling little angels--and you know how it is your- self. And, moreover--and that is the best excuse-it was the precise idea that came into Mr. Ledgeral's head as he stood and listened to the workings of his new well. It was not a steadily flowing well. It was intermittent, like the famous Fox well at Petroleum Centre on Oil Creek. It flowed by spurts at regular intervals, and at the time Mr. Ledgeral had reached the ground was yielding about a hun- dred and forty barrels a day. A pretty deep and sudden drop in forty-eight hours from a thousand barrels! But Mr. Ledg- eral had to make some allowance for the excited fancy that at'the first spurt measured the flow, especially as he found upon close examination no evidence in his tanks of any such pro- duction. Still, a flowing well of one hundred and forty barrels, with oil even at four dollars a barrel, is not to be despised. And Mr. Ledgeral didn't despise it. He respected it--he admired ' it -he rejoiced in it with a  deep and grateful joy. He watched it by day with a sentiment of profound thankfulness. He   listened to it at night in a state of solemn delight.   NEa VER A GAIN.        579 Things have changed very much for the better in the oil regions, although flowing wells are now pretty much among the things that were. The world has moved there as well as here. And why should it not, since nowhere have its ways been more thoroughly lubricated. Railroads now have taken the place of the rows of gullies and holes, formerly called roads, where wheel carriages were matters of sheer desperation ; where even a cavalier took his life in his hand every time he threw his leg over the saddle; or where a pedestrian could pursue his oleaginous way only at the imminent risk, every ten yards, of slumping quite through into the regions of eternal slush. It is understood' now, that a gentleman can walk the streets of Franklin, or Oil City, or Titusville, even in wet weather without getting much over his knees in mud; and as for hotel accommodation, it is quite superb. Any one can now get a good, " square" meal-that is, if he is used to the usual horrors of American cooking--at many places where formerly he would have had to sit down to a table groaning-or perhaps a better word would be grunting- with rancid butter, rusty mackerel, salt junk, and sodden bread, with perhaps nothing but a boiled watery potato between him and absolute starvation. And as for lodging, one has no longer to pass the night in a feverish doze over a red-hot stove in the bar-room, or sleep three in a bed, without sheets, and every man with his boots on. There are various geological theories as to the origin of petroleum. Mr. Ledgeral had studied them all, and had decided in his own mind in favor of the slow distillation of the marine, animal, and vegetable matter that loaded the sea- beaches of the ancient world, but as he stood by his-well in the silence of the night, and listened to the panting and wheezing sound preceding each ejection, and then to the fierce, spiteful spitting of oil in three or four rapid jets, and then to the gurgling grunts and sighs that followed the exer- tion, the whole process lasting perhaps a minute, with an inter- val of only fifteen or twenty seconds, he could hardly keep   580        NE VE/R AGAN.           himself from the belief that the thing was alive-that some great monster was at the bottoln of it-that the drill had tapped the blubber of some antediluvian kraken. And now, as has been said at the beginning of tlis chapter, the monster was dead. He had given the last sign of animation; not another sigh or groan; not another drop of ooil.  The well had lasted only three weeks, when it stopped almost as suddenly as it had begun. Everything to resusci. tate it was tried,--the tubing was drawn ; the drill inserted; the bore retubed,-all to no use. The seed-bag-a leather pouch surrounding the tube, and filled with flax-seed, which, swelling with the water and thus stopping up two or three feet in length of the space between the tube and the sides of the well, cuts off the superincumbent water from  the well below -had been changed half-a-dozen times.  Up and down- now  above the first sandstone-now below  it-and now  almost to the bottom; the pump had been worked for a week --nothing but salt water, hardly a barrel of oil. As alast resort a torpedo of nitroglycerine was lowered to the bot. tom, and exploded by the electric spark. No result. The monster was dead.  And what killed him? Therewas no regular jury impanelled, but everybody from Oil City to Titusville sat upon the question, and some thought he died for want of breath, and some thought that he had choked himself with a big lump of paraffine, but the majority of the more experienced decided that he had been drowned, and that the accident came about from boring two or three wells in close proximity. And what made the matter worse, these wells, which had been pushed down with greedy energy, upon being tubed and tested, yielded little or nothing. A dark cloud at once settled down upon the territory of the Big Thing Petroleum Company, and a still darker cloud settled down again upon Mr. Ledgeral's mind. He had, as  it seemed, been lifted to the heights of hope only to make more fearful his plunge into the depths of despair. lie came back to the city looking worse and feeling worse L ^S CKS S^^^   NE VER A GAIN.         581 than before he started. And in every respect the situation was worse. He owed more money. He could clearly fore- see the time when his debts would become very pressing, and every day that had passed had only brought him nearer to a time for settlement with the Count. He was again a dis- honest, and soon to be a dishonored, man, hanging over the brink of ruin. Success gilds evil, covering up its deformities, and con- cealing its harms. It has always done so in the public mind, perhaps always will do so. Why ask or expect a man, then, to be much better than the age, and why demand a much clearer sight, a sharper, swifter judgment from the conscience of the individual than from the common moral sense in which, and by which, his whole character has been moulded? Practically and actually, then, success justifies and sanc- tifies much that theoretically we know to be evil, and on the other hand failure exhibits it in all its deformity. Oh yes, when the great man is "down," "burst up," or has been stripped of his money or his power, we can all see what a wicked man he was, and not only wicked, but foolish. And just so with a man's own estimate of his own deeds and thoughts. People talk, especially the good people of the "intuitive" school, as if conscience in each man was of a fixed force-the same always in quantity, and they really seem to think that it requires a violent effort of the will to turn away from its warnings.  Whereas, in the full blaze of successful villainy, a man loses for the time all moral sense, and his conscience selects the darkest and most secluded cham- ber of his brain, and falls into such a sound sleep that it can only be awakened by the loud knocking of evil conse- quences. He is not capable of judging of the moral qualities of his actions, so that we might in many cases adopt the paradox "the bigger the rascal the more honest the man." But take away the glow and glitter of success. Ah! then conscience begins to wake and work, and, in working, grows more strong and more clear. The egg of remorse is hatched out under the rotting leaves of unfruitful sin.   582        NEVRER AGAIN. The little animal peeps into the light of consciousness, and rapidly grows into a snake of a dozen rattles. Serpents are viviparous! Thank you, kind sir, but we'll let the figure stand; any reptilian form will do--"basilisk, or cockatrice, or mailed saurian." The owner of the animal feels his fangs, and if questioned upon the subject will be ready to admit that a man never feels so sorry for any wicked thing that he has done as when he has awakened fully to the conviction that he has done it for nothing--that le has served the devil without pay. And that was precisely Mr. Ledgeral's case. Poor man! Let us pity him, and firmly resolve that we never will give  Satan tick for a penny's worth of sin. Ready money, and cash down, Old Boy, if you want any of your rascally jobs done by us. "So you think it was the new well that killed the old one," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers. "Well, well, that illustrates the old saying, ' Better let well alone.'" It is doubtful whether it was not as much a desire to escape from Mr. Whoppers, as a determination to see for himself how matters were standing between Helen and the Count, that induced Mr. Ledgeral to decide suddenly on a visit to West Point. There had been numerous notices in the daily papers of the affair in Wooster Street, but all of them rather meagre. Mr. Whoppers had exerted his tact and diplomatic skill, and his influence with the police-officers and reporters to this end. He alone had all the details from the beginning, and he was not going to lose the opportunity, for a grand sensational in the Universe. He called Luther into his office two or three days after the fight, to show him the proof of his article. "Here we all are," he exclaimed. "Got us all-three columns : Brilj liant Exploits of Amateur Detectives-Professionals Nowhere -Inefficiency of the Police--Rottenness and Corruption of - the system-Gallant Rescue, from the hands of a desperate Band of Kidnappers and Murderers, of the great French Millioneuse."

"Well, I rather think," said Luther, " that I prefer the slang." "So do I," said Mr. Whoppers, " but it wouldn't do in this case; besides, I try to keep the Universe clear from slang. You know the Universe goes in for the genteel, as well as for the moral and religious. Why, I'd no more admit a slangy article, however vigorous, than I would admit a page of Her- bert Spencer, a lecture by John Fiske, or any exposition of the real views and discoveries of Tyndal and Huxley and Agassiz and Darwin, or any other of the host of wicked scientific men who are upsetting the good old geology and ethnology of Gen- esis. However, that is neither here nor there. At present I wanted to say something to you. And first, how is your old friend?" "Oh, she's gaining." "Gaining, of course she is. She'll gain to the last moment of her life. And all the better for you, my boy-that is, if shq don't live too long. But I suppose, now she is getting better, you will be thinking about going back to your old place in Burling Slip. It is still open for you." "Yes, Mr. Gainsby informed me yesterday that they were wanting me back. He had the politeness to say that he did not see how they could get along without me." "Well, then, my advice is, don't be in a hurry. A few days more or less don't make any difference. You have been hard worked lately; so have I. Suppose we take two or three days, and run up to West Point?  ' Why the Ledgerals are there.': "Well, suppose they are; they can't hurt us. At any rate, we can keep clear of them." Luther at first resolutely refused, and for some time he tried to fortify his determination with reasons drawn from the condition of Madame Steignitz, and from the necessity of re- turning at once to his work. But there was a secret traitor in the camp, quietly undermining the walls of resolution-a lurk- ing devil of a desire to see her-to be near her--to live in the same house with her-perchance to speak to her, and to tell   NVE VER AGAIN.        585 her that if she did marry the Count he hoped she would do better, and be happier, than most American girls who have married foreign titles-yes, he would go. "And I'll propose the thing to Boggs. His face is almost well, and the Stichens have gone off to Saratoga,. "Gone! I didn't know that," exclaimed Luther. "I meant to have called there this evening." "Yes, Dr. Petcalf told Stichen that he wouldn't guarantee his life a day if he did not clear right out. I'll tell you what my opinion is. I think the little man is in a bad way. He has been making too much money lately, and it has gone to his liver. I'm afraid he'll step out suddenly. He's had one touch, you know." "Let us hope, for her sake, that he may never have another." "Amen! Although I don't know that it would be such a misfortune for her. She'd make a widow,--young, handsome, clever, and rich. I don't see how you (ould crowd more of human bliss into a small package, and then you know the old saying, ' There's as good fish in the sea,' etc., applies as well to a dead husband as to a lost lover." "Meaning yourself," exclaimed Luther, somewhat indig- nantly. "Well, I don't say no. I might be disposed, in such a case, to angle a little in that water, if it weren't for one thing. I'm afraid Boggs could, and would, outcast me." Luther turned on his heel. o Well then, it's understood, to-morrow, at half-past three, we all meet on board the Mary Powell."   CHAPTER XXXII. Fashionable Hotels-Luther and Helen at West Point-Uncle Shippen on Dancing-His opinion of the German. -HERE are, as is well known, perhaps half-a-dozen sum- mer resorts of the highest fashion,-places where the hotel registers have the power of the libro d'oro,-the. mere entering of your name is a distinction -places where a dinner is a step upward, your bed-room key the insignia of rank, and your week's bill quite a patent of nobility. There are, besides, innumerable watering-places, great and small, where fashionable people can and do go without losing caste,-some quiet, respectable, and stupid; some noisy, fast, and amusing or disgusting, according to taste;-but there is hardly more than half-a-dozen, if so many, where the aura of fashion settles down upon the place in a visible cloud. Not that these consecrated places are confined to one class. They may be cliquish, but they are not exclusive. You will meet thousands of queer people, fast people, and slow people, vulgar and refined people-ladies who get all their dresses from Paris, and ladies who never heard the name of Worth or Vasseur or L'Archeveque, and who don't even know Didon or- Madame Volorem-women who have pushed their way, and women who are pushing their way; but notwithstanding this jumble, a certain odor of haut ton pervades the atmos- phere, an,  'heres persistently in the constitution of the place. And. yet these places are not at all alike-not alike even in the character of the fashionable aureole that hangs over them. But this difference is one to be felt rather than described.   NE VER AGA N.         587 The brush of a painter may make the variations in the glory of sunset apparent, but words are powerless to more than in- dicate their existence. We might, perhaps, with our own poor pen, convey a tolerable idea of the geographical and topo- graphical position,-the character and extent of the accommo- dations at Sharon, Saratoga, West Point, Newport, and New London-with an analysis of the company, and a summary of the amusements,-the whole winding up with an estimate of the comparative amounts of health, strength, moral improvement and social enjoyment afforded by each in a season; but that would not touch the point we are trying to get at. We should be just as far as ever froip conveying a sense of those delicate varieties in the parfum de societ; those softened variations in the lustre of the pure purple of fashion, characteristic of each place. Boggs, perhaps, might do it; or, still better, Peter Weddemall. He has all the profound knowledge of a society- man, and wields the pen of a poet. The subject is difficult, and might, perhaps, have better not been broached; but it is not too late for the reader to leave it, and jump on board the Mary Powell, the pride of the lower Hudson, as she throws off her fasts from the wharf, and starts on her afternoon trip up the river. All our party are on board. Mr. Boggs has a scratch or two on his cheek, and a black mark under his eye. He don't care about showing himself among the crowd of ladies on the upper deck. Captain Combings wants to smoke; Mr. Whoppers wants to read the newspaper, and Luther wants to look at the scenery and enjoy. the cool, pure breeze, and there is no better place for all than below forward in the bow of the boat. What with pure air, fine scenery, pleasant conversation, the second edition of an evening journal, and a mild cigar, a fellow must be very ex- acting if he can't manage to pass pleasantly the two hours and a half between the city and West Point. The Powell has the tide with her-it is one of her quick trips, and she is going along at the rate of twenty-five miles an hour. It would be a shame, when her passengers are   588  i;      NEVER1 AGAIN. travelling so fast, to detain the reader with any unnecessary details. We will, therefore, suppose everybody to have landed, and the coaches and carriages to have delivered their loads under the inquisitive eyes of the well-dressed crowd assembled on the piazza, avowedly to, greet friends, but as much or more to criticise strangers. It was not until Luther had secured his room, and was quietly seated at his window looking out on to the slopes of "Sugar Loaf, that he fairly put the question to himself-"Why had he come? what a weak irresolute fool!" and the old simnile of the moth and the candle is too- common not to have oc- curred to him. "Just one last look! But why a last look, if that look is to be painful, or, worse, full of peril? Just to say good-bye for the last time. But why good-bye once more, if the parting is to be immediate and formal? Would there be any sense in mending a broken chain only to sever it the next instant? Yes, yes! to be near her for one instant, to speak to her once more, perhaps to touch her hand! It is worth any pain, any peril, any sacrifice. What! just for a few moments? and then-and then--nothing but blank misery, and oh! such a long life before me. God help me, but I wish I had gone with the old Montaigne to the bottom, below that bluff! No, no, not that, for then I never should have seen her. But if I could have starved to death that night!" And suddenly Luther, giving full sway to the passionate tide of feeling, flung his head upon his arms resting on the window-sill, and fairly groaned as his compressed eyelids squeezed out two or three drops of boiling fluid, and all the world vanished from his view. "O God, I cannot, will not, live without her, I will die! I must die." At the sound of his own passionate exclamation, he jumped to his feet and stared for a moment wildly around the room. Can it be that such a nice young man is going to give way to an access of suicidal mania? Not a bit of it; he does something much more sensible. He goes to the wash-   NVE R A GAIN.   589   stand, and laves his face, head and all, in a basin of cold water. You should have seen him when he emerged, and was drying his dripping locks-his face all aglow, his eyes spar- kling, and his brown hair standing all over his head in curls that fairly quivered and danced with freshened vitality. He kill himself! and for love? Bah! the world can't do without a few such. Are all its honors, and riches, and rewards to be forever and eternally inherited-we won't say enjoyed- by the gross, sensual, an-d selfish, or by sickly, mean, miserable, dirty devils, who have no idea but to heap up wealth without using it, and extort consideration without pay- ing for it!-whose sole ambition is to swindle the public, by passing off the false counters of notoriety for the pure gold of fame! No; our Luther had no such foolish thoughts. He was in love-desperately in love, as a good many strong men have been before him. But he was no silly swain to sigh his life away for love. The world might never be so bright again, but it had its interests, and worthy ones too. There comes a time to all men, it is said, when the glamour of life wears away and we wake to a sense of the dull, poor reality. Why not as well reach that point suddenly with one quick- sharp shock, as to wait the slow attrition of mean cares and disagreeable duties-'the slow -and deliberate tapping of time? The most that could be said would be that he was old early. No! come what might, he was lord of himself and master qf his convictions. He was not the slave of passion, and he would not be drawn by it into any selfish and reckless disre- gard of right and duty. The idea of trying to induce his beloved to run off with him never occurred to him; he never thought of such a thing. The obstacles to his love, he saw and admitted, were in- superable. He was dominated by the social conditions under which he lived. Why shouldn't he be? You may rail, if you please, against the pricks, but it is very foolish to kick against them.    590         NE VER A GAIN. It used to-be a doctrine-taught by our great teachers ot all knowledge, the novelists-that a hero who wouldn't jump out of a two-story window into the gutter with his beloved, in defiance of a prudent parent, must necessarily be lacking in all the better elements of a spirited lover. Nothing can be more silly or more erroneous. There may, perhaps, be a few cases where prudence and good sense, as well as passion, counsel the furtive ; but, in general, the young mhan who urges an elopement, or who will persist in marrying a girl against the wishes of her family and the suggestions of prudence, is a selfish, mean-spirited, and very often, in every way, a worth- less cur. And the girl! What of the girl? Why, she's a weak, silly goose, and, perhaps, deserves to be punished, as she probably will be, by a life of domestic misery. A fair match, then! why not let them marry? So I would, were it not that they are sure to have a family of ill-bred, ignorant, wayward children to perpetuate and dissemi- nate all of their parents' mean foibles and petty vices of char- acter and manners. This was the way Uncle Shippen talked, and we can't think that the comical old quiz was much out on this point; at any rate Luther practically coincided with him. If it had been a mere question of bread and butter, it might have been different. Luther had no want of confidence in his own power to earn what the world would call a good living. And he felt, moreover, that he and Helen. could live together very well on bread without butter, if that were all. But taking a girl out of her social sphere-bringing her down from her fashionable estate to the dull realities of simple well- fed respectability-it was impossible. The very genius of conventionality forbids it; the united voice of society forbids; every feeling of honor, magnanimity, and generosity forbids it; even love itself forbids it. It is impossible. As well un- dertake to bring down the planets for billiard-balls, or the stars of the milky-way to light up the opera-bouff. Mrs. Ledgeral never exhibited more tact than she did when she first met Luther at the foot of the stairs leading to   I   yEVER A GAIN.    -    591 the grand hall. He had suddenly become famous-his name was in the newspapers-and though inwardly disturbed at his unexpected appearance, it would never do to convert him into a persecuted and ill-treated hero by any supercilious or haughty manifestations on her part. A neglected hero, or a hero with a grievance, might be dangerous; whereas, as things stood, it was to be hoped that all danger had neatly or quite passed by. She advanced to him, presented her hand with a certain warmth of manner, and made numerous inquiries about the i adventure that she had seen noticed in the journals. L Luther was pleased, but hardly deceived. It is easy to see through a friendly manner when the unfriendliness that it covers is mingled with fear. The man who is about to strike may conceal his design with sweet smiles and honeyed phrases, but the man who anticipates a blow finds it much more difficult to impose upon his adversary by jaunty confi- dence and affected ease. Luther felt that Mrs. Ledgeral de- tested him, but he felt grateful to her for having helped him so nicely through the embarrassment of a first meeting, and he in turn made, in a free, matter-of-course style, his inquiries after the members of the family. Mr. Ledgeral? Yes, Mr. Ledgeral came up from the city two days ago. Couldn't say .how long he would stay; was looking very bad, and she really had great fears for his health. And Helen? She was not looking very well either; was afraid that West Point had not agreed very well with her. A trip to Europe-some of those German springs-would be the thing. Hoped that Helen would be able to go out this fall. "I go? Oh, no ; I'm afraid not. I shall have to stay to look after Mr. Ledgeral, but Helen will be well taken care of-she will go in the charge of a very good friend," and here Mrs. Ledgeral gave an emphatic nod of the head and a little confi- dential smirk, as much as to say, It's all settled. Luther was saved froin the necessity of a reply by Mr. Whoppers, who flourished up at this moment. "Ah! Mrs. Ledgeral, I must congratulate you. Pray tell   aYHi        DONVER AGAIN.  us when it'll be. Luther and myself are great hands at a secret." "Indeed, Mr. Whoppers, the report is, to say the least of it, premature. There has been no announcement of anything  "Oh, yes, I see. You won't authorize the journals to say anything about it just yet, but in private you count upon it, eh? I must ask Helen." "Oh, no, no; don't say a word to her about it. She is so sensitive she will deeply resent any allusion of the kind, I as. ! sure you. She will be very angry with you."  "With me! Whoppers!   Impossible.  Where is she?" "She has gone to the evening parade with Count Isen- thal." "It's all settled!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, taking Lu. ther's arm and leading him out for'a turn on the piazza; "it's all settled, but I'll be hanged if I like it. Hope it hasn't'hit you hard, old fellow? Well, well, it isn't, perhaps, a bad thing in the end to have a fellow's affections rubbed up a little the wrong way. It's like rubbing up a cat's back; it makes the sparks fly at the time, but both fur and feeling lie snugger after it.'  "Confound it," contipued Mr. Whoppers; " those fellows 1 with handles to their names come  over here and set our women-folks half mad. And I never knew any good come of it. At the first go off there were those Caton cases. Well, they made rather brilliant matches, but since then look at 'em. There was Molly Boggs, one of the prettiest and sweetest girls and biggest dots in New York. She could have had the pick and choice of the jeJnesse dore, which perhaps is no great privilege, but also of the rising young men-the fellows with a  future before them-possible editors-or, if not quite so high as that, novelists, statesmen, bankers, commission-merchants and seven-ciphered millionnaires. Well, now, I don't believe one-twentieth part of the lies afloat, but one can't say that the match was a  brilliant one. And then look at the Stich- neys. What did they gain bfy hankering after the aristocracy? I/   NE VYER A4 GAIN.         593 And then there was that miserable affair of Miss Perrywinkle. And there is Billet--he married off his daughter, cd la mode de Paris, and they say that he is quite willing to admit that all marriage is a lottery. There's Madame la Duchesse d'An- guelain, de Ville cour,-I guess she wishes she had married with the Basse cour. 'And then there was that affair of Mrs. De Graw Brown. Why the fellow robbed her and mistreated her in every way--locked her up a close prisoner, and threat- ened to murder her by,running a needle in between her cervical vertebrae. To be sure there are some who have not done so very badly. There's the Jones faction. They might perhaps have stayed at home and fared worse--especially the Duchess. Don't know much of the Marquise, but the Duke is a jolly good fellow. But perhaps the most appropriate thing of the kind has been in the matter of the Duchessa delle Turretti: but then she was brought up with foreign tastes, habits and lan- guages, and the Duke, no one can deny, is a nice young man. Still, one swallow don't make a good long drink, and for two or three girls who have bought not only a title but a decent husband with it, there are more than a hundred who have found themselves swindled aut of youth, beauty and fortune, and with nothing but some worthless sprig of broken-down and vagabond nobility to show for it all.    v "I don't like this business," continued Mr. Whoppers after a pause. "The Count is a Count, no doubt, and rich too ; but why the Ledgerals should push matters so determin- edly, and what Helen can see in him to make her consent I can't see, and especially if, as I suspect, she don't care much for him personally. She can't want his title. She is the most sensible girl in New York society, and society-girls are not all fools. No thanks, however, to their education and training. Why I know a dozen who would spurn the Grand Duke of Nephelococcygia himself, unless he came as a nice young man-and Helen is one of them. No, I don't believe she cares a straw for his title of Count-but there is no account- ing for feminine tastes. Some girls like slate-pencils better than sugar-candy, and prefer chalk to cheese. 38   594        NE VER AGAIN. "Ah, there's Boggs with a cigar in his mouth."' And Mr. Whoppers pulled out his cigar-case, and selecting a Partiga of what he called the Stichen brand, darted off to Mr. Boggs for a light. Luther, left to himself, wandered into the spacious draw ing-room.. He found himself alone ; the lamps were not yet lighted for -the evening, but the reflex glow of mellow twilight streamed into the eastern windows, and filled the vast room with a flood of quiet, subdued radiance. He could just dis- tinguish the features of the fine head of a young girl, by Sully, hanging upon the wall; and he stood before the portrait for some minutes in silence. There was a light footstep and the delicatefroufrout of organdy, and a soft voice exclaimed, "It is a fine picture and a charming face, don't you think?" Luther turned, and quietly took Helen's extended hand. His nerves had been recently too well exercised in emotions of all kinds to even quiver or tremble again. He held the soft hand for a moment. It was not so plump as he had known it. He looked into her face. A less iager and pene- trating glance would have shown him that it lhad grown wan and thin.  Helen began to feel a little embarrassed at the scrutiny; she must force herself to some commonplace. - "You were very much absorbed," she said, indicating the picture. "It's a fine painting, and not a bad face. Do you know, some people insist upon paying me the compliment of saying that it looks a little like me." "There is a possible resemblance," replied Luther, " be- tween you and the original." "In the features?" "No." "In the expression?" "No." "What then?" "In this: that with such beauty of face, such indications of soul and sentiment and intellect, it may well be that she, too, has ere this given some poor devil the heart-ache."   The words were uttered in a low voice, but there was something intensely bitter in the tone. Helen turned her eyes up at the picture with one wild flash, that almost instantly melted into a dreamy gaze. "Perhaps the resemblance is still more striking," she mut- tered, as if speaking to herself. "How so?" "In this"-and the whisper almost died in her throat- "in this : that she, poor wretch, may have had, the heart-ache too." And as she spoke her form seemed to shrink down, until Luther instinctively stretched out his arm to support her; and her cheek grew gray, almost ashen, in the fading light. "Helen! oh Helen!"But she motioned his arm away. There was no one in the room, but a dozen people were flitting by the windows encircling it on three sides, and occa- sionally looking in. No one saw anything but two young people standing quietly before Sully's picture. 'Tis often thus, that the most impassioned scenes in the drama of life pass directly beneath our idle eyes, and we see nothing. The flashes and corruscations of harmless heat- lightning we gaze at and wink and wonder; but the thunder- bolt that rives the oak to its heart often gathers its force in silence, and tells us nothing of itself until the grand crash. A mild flirtation, especially if it have a spice of the improper -as, for instance, between a gray-headed old roue. with mar- ried children and somebody's pretty young wife-will furnish talk for the town, that is, for the town of "our set; " but a deep, desperate passion, on which hang the issues of life or death, will sometimes play its game to the end without a single gossiping member of the galerie being able to distinguish coin I or counter.. But why interrupt a love-scene with stupid reflections and lame comparisons and halting figures? It is wrong, and we haste back to the young couple, who, side by side, in silence made two or three turns up and down the room.  "This is folly," at length said Helen.  596        NEVE V A X GAIN. "I know it, worse than folly; madness!" W"Why then did you come here?" "Simply because I could not help myself. I had to see you once more. I wanted to hear from your own lips that the thing is settled." "It is settled that we never can be anything to each other but friends. You know that." "Yes; but I never can seem to be sure of it until I hear you are engaged to the Count. Tell me that it is so, and I will go away to-morrow morning. Don't say that I have no right to question you. I have the right-the right of mortal pain and agony; your own heart tells you that I have the right to know the exact truth. It can do me no good perhaps, in either way, but it seems to me that settled misery must be better than this fitful fever of doubt, and hope, and despair. Tell me then, are you going to marry the Count?" Helen stopped short in her walk, and clasping her hands passionately uttered a low moan. "I must," she cried; "I cannot help myself. I have promised my father this very day that I would within the week give the Count a favorable answer." "Arnd you love him?" "How can you ask such a question?  You mock me. I do not love him," added Helen in a firmer tone; "but I shall try, and I believe I shall succeed, for I believe him to be all that is noble and good! He certainly behaves to me with great generosity and consideration. But, had I reasons to dislike him, I still must marry him ,-not for the poor pitiful reasons that all the world will suppose."    - Helen slipped her arm within Luther's and looked up im- ploringly in his face. "You will not think so meanly of me. You will believe that I have better and stronger reasons than I can tell. Luther Lansdale, you must believe me! It is a secre, a terrible secret, between my father and myself. You have seen him; you know what a sick man he is. He is dying, and I alone know the cause; I alone can save him. Don't think that he is trying to deceive me to what he thinks   ANEVER AGAIN.         597 my good. You have but to see him and you would be satis- fied. You have no idea how much he has failed in two or three weeks. He looks like a ghost-almost like a corpse." "But how can your marrying the Count relieve him?" ex- claimed Luther. "Oh, that I can't tell you-it is a secret-and-and-I don't know that I fully understand it myself. But father tells me so, and I must believe him. He assures me that he will be a well man in a month if I marry the Count, and that the whole family will be saved." C"Saved! from what?" "Well, perhaps H-I-should not--I-ought not to say what. No, no, I cannot say what." "I cannot understand it," muttered Luther. "You need not understand it. It could make no differ- ence to you-to me-to any one, if you did understand it. Oh, I could tell you something that would make you at least feel it--I will tell you-why should I not?" The little hand clasped Luther's arm with convulsive ener- gy, and yet with no motion or gesture that, would have attrac- ted attention, or disturbed the cool decorum of the drawing- room had it been filled. But as yet not a soul had come into the rapidly darkening room, save the old porter with his torch for lighting the gas. "I will tell you something!-you will never mention it!- something which will let you see how impossible it is for me to resist. Father went down upon his knees to me-to his daughter, down on his knees this very day, scarce two hours since, begging me by all my love for him, by every considera- tion of affection and duty, to consent." Something in the young man's look-something electric in the slight tremor that -an through his frame, startled the young girl. "Oh, Luther!" she exclaimed, " you must forgive me; you must forget me!" "Forgive you!" he replied, and the low, stern tones of his voice went through and through her heart with a sweeping    598        NE VER A GAIN. thrust. "Forgive you, why should I not? what have I to for. give? Yes, 1 will forgive you, but I will curse fate forever. And as to forgetting you," he continued, swiftly slipping his arm round her waist and holding her with convulsive force to his heart, while their parched and bloodless lips met for an  instant in one fierce, despairing kiss; "forget you, never! never!  Slhe tottered back from the sudden embrace, and instinct. ively stretched out her hand to the marble mantel-piece for support, just as the first jet sprang into flame under old John's torch. It is astonishing the amount of conventionality and social propriety developed by one single gas-jet. The subject is a curious one, and intimately cennected with the doctrine of correlation of forces. Professor Tyndal, who has done so much to decide the musical properties of flames, ought to take up the'question, and let us know exactly how much carbon is consumed to a certain quantity of good conduct, either in the streets or the drawing-room; and how much decorum is devel- oped by a stated number of particles of oxygen, clashing with a given number of particles of hydrogen. The gas companies could afford to pay the expenses of the investigation. They could add an item to their bills-Dr. to so much propriety; and at once stop all the grumbling about their extortion and swindling. The young couple felt the influence of the light, and in- stinctively drew back into positions that would have satisfied the requisitions of Mrs. Grundy, had she stopped in her walk round and round the piazza to look into the room. Luckily a minute was allowed for the half-fond, half- reproachful expression of mingled fright, and misery, and despair in her face, and the fierce, reckless passion of his, to resolve itself in both into a quiet and subdued look, in which hardly the keen and jealous eyes of Mrs. Ledgeral could have traced any evidences of profound feeling. Half a minute only, when that lady came through one of the open windows, fol- lowed by the Count.   NEVER A GA IN.  -      599 4"Oh, Helen I you here? I have been looking all over for you. And M  r. L ansdale too ! H e has been telling you all about his adventure, I suppose? Count, let me present to  you Mr. Lansdale, one' of our clerks in the store down town, oand Mrs. Ledgeral slightly emph asized the last phrase. Luther winced a little. There was something in the bald New Yorkism, " a store down town," that flashed such a bright light into the depths of the golden gulf. If she adsaid-the ouse, or th company or the counting-room-butaclerkin a store down town!                It It had an excelle  nt effect upon Luther's manner. It brought out, as if by an electric ray, the fact engraven on his mind, but which, nevertheless, had a strange disposition to occasionally fade out of consciousness, that the Count was not the only or the chief barrier between him and Helen; that she would be as far from him if the Count had never risen above the horizon of New York fashion. And so to the presentation Luther bowed quite graciously. "Mr. Whoppers has been telling us about the affair, but I should like to have your account a little more in detail. Count, it won't interest you, perhaps, and, Helen, you won't want to hear it all over again-we won't keep you. Luther will sit down here and talk to me quietly for a little while. Mind, my dear, don't stroll away too far; I want to go in to tea in half an hour. "Lovers are so apt to forget everything and everybody but themselves, and the Count is so agreeable," continued Mrs. Ledgeral. "Dear Helen, she is a good girl, and I hope she will be happy; but I don't know how she will like living in Germany. The Count, however, is getting very much Americanized, and I have great hopes. There are so many foreigners who come over and live here for some length of time, grumbling and fault-finding every moment of their stay. They return to their own country for a while, when back they come. They have had enough of the old home, and they always make much more quiet and agreeable citizens on their second visit. So I have great hopes of the Count.   600o       A2E VER A C1AINx.  "And now tell me something about this old woman you rescued. Mr. Boggs says she is quite a character and that she is worth considerable property-owns a house or two- have you any idea who she is and where she comes from? Is she really French or German?" Luther had hardly time to reply to the question when Mr, Boggs, accompanied by Mr. Ledgeral, entered the room. The smallest nod of the head was all the salutation the latter vouchsafed to the young man. But Luther was so shocked by the change in the great man's appearance, that he hardly noticed the scant courtesy. "If every man's internal care was written on his brow as plainly as it is on that man's," thought Luther, "How many would our pity share who claim our envy now."' ; What can it be? and how can Mrs. Ledgeral be so blind? Has she no eyes? Can't she see? The man is dying of menr tal misery-what can it be? I cannot, cannot undefrstand it!" and Luther took advantage of Mrs. Struggles' appearance at this moment to step off for a solitary stroll to the falls. Later in the evening, he was standing in an angle ofthe piazza overlooking the river. The parlors, large and small, were all lighted, but as the weather was warm tOe company, generally, remained outside. The colored band, in the large room, kept pouring forth its -inviting strains of dance-music, but no one heeded. West Point never was a great place for dancing. It never could compare in this respect with many of its rivals. The cotillion was never known to begin there at ten o'clock in the morning, and last without intermission until twelve at night. Mr. Boggs says that this is owing to the fact that there are never so many young dancing people as at the other places, and that the traditions of the place are not of the saltatious kind. But this only explains the matter in part. We must look deeper. Mr. Whoppers says the air is not so jiggerous as at Sharon, or New London, or Newport; but that is non- sense, as well in idea as in words. Two reasons, however,   stand out distinctly-one is, that an immense amount of dan- cing capacity is used up by the system of academic hops. The Government has a lot of young bears in training, and it skil- fully avails itself of feminine influence; and it adroitly keeps up the supply by somehow disseminating the notion among the very young girls that it is quite a privilege. There is a back action in this as in all motion. Miss Dickenchild is the belle of the season. She has danced all over America and all over Europe. She has danced at Constantinople, and Cairo, and Jerusalem, and Damascus, and once even, while travelling in the Holy Land, took a turn, j ist for fun, with Bucky Stringsby one evening, in front of the tent on the shore of the Dead Sea, very much to the delectation of Sheik Abdurahman ben Soulimun iben Abram and his friends-can it be expected that ' she-a girl who has stood up with Count Fidil Fadal at Com- piegne, and had Prince Charming's arm round her waist for half-an-hour at Delmonico's, should take any interest in cadet hops? Not she, and thus comes a reflex air, or aura, that is not favorable to dancing at the Large Hotel, Another reason is, unquestionably, the width and extent of the piazzas. Everybody likes to get outside, and keep outside, when the weather will permit. There is a fine large room almost vacant, and plenty of light and music, but somehow people prefer to sit around and look through the windows, and the dancing is half the time left to the children. And this illustrates a curious law of aggregation. Just in proportion as people at parties and social junketings of all kinds are crowded together, the saltatory disposition is generated. Segregate them-give them plenty of room-and nobody cares for dancing; but crowd your small parlors with a solid, panting mass of humanity, fill your hall as com- pactly as a box of red herrings, and load your staircase till it cracks, and instantly forty couple will spring into the air with bacchantic ftiry, and woe! woe! unto any obese old fogy, or corpulent dowager, whose too solid flesh won't melt, thaw, or resolve itself for the occasion.   602         ArE' VER AGAI V. Why is this? The terms of the problem are as patent as the solution is difficult. It is a mystery. 'Darwin don't allude to it; Herbert Spencer barely touches the question; Ham- ilton and Mill ignore it entirely; Gladstone, in his imitations of Homer, gives it the go-by, and Disraeli, in his treatise de myslerio Asiatico omnibusque rebus et quibmsdam aiis, treats it from a wrong point of view. On this side of the water lve ,are equally destitute of philosophical acumen directed to' this subject. Beecher, in his lectures, touches everything under and above heaven, but he has not touched the rationale of this law of aggregation. Whence and why is it? General Grant may perhaps know, but he won't tell. Greeley is of course willing to tell, but he don't know. Agassiz would be good authority, but he is not sound on the evolution ques- tion; and Emerson and   the autocrat of the breakfast-table could talk about it delightfully by the hour, but perhaps without anybody except themselves being a bit the wiser. We want, then, some one who, aided only by the pure light of science, can grope his way back to the origin of things, put his finger upon the ultimate fact, and thus solve the mystery in the terms of simple well-known physical conditions, and in strict accordance with the theory of de- velopment. Now, I know no one who has even made the attempt except Uncle Shippen, and at the risk of being tedious and of keeping Luther standing too long in that dark angle of the piazza, we must as succinctly as possible give his views. The old gentleman takes off his wig, in order to allow his ideas clear play. "Now I   am not going into the development theory in general, or into the sufficiency of Darwin's principles of nat- ural and sexual selection; but I'll just answer your question, why aggregation excites the idea of dancing,--why in society the greater the jam the more everybody wants to dance. The fact is, dancing was originally the product, the outgrowth, of aggregation. The idea that there is any natural and necessary connection between certain musical sounds, or the           i,   NE VER AGAIN.         603 mental emotions excited, and certain regular and rhythmic movements of the body, is absurd. The whole thing comes in this wise: Away back, just after the glacial period, eight hundred and fifty six thousand years ago, when the earth was beginning to renounce the extreme eccentricity which had char- acterized her motions, the climate was still exceedingly cold in winter, and man-or man's progenitors-suffered at times terribly. 'Tis true, as the biologists prove, that at that time our folks were all covered with thick coats of hair, but, in the entire absence of artificial clothing and without the knowledge of fire, that was hardly sufficient to keep them warm at all times. Gradually the fact began to dawn upon their minds that by crowding up close together a degree of pleasant warmth was generated and preserved. Gradually, in the course of ages, the knowledge of this fact spread until it became the general custom to huddle up together to keep out of the cold. The idea, at first the result of observation, and reason, becomes at length, in the course of a hundred i thousand years or so, instinctive; it passes beyond the region of mere consciousness-forces its way along the iter a tertio ad quartfurn ventricuium, where it is stowed away, and becomes for- ever the property of the human mind. And now another fact is observed-another idea is generated, and either stowed away in a ventricle, or hung up on the hippocampus major to dry. It is observed that muscular exertion-jumping up and down- generates warmth; and in the course of another hundred thousand years the shivering crowds of quiescent proto-homos become active, jumping masses of intelligent humanity. And the colder it is the closer they huddle, and the closer they huddle the harder they jump, until the ideas of aggregation and saltation become indissolubly associated, while the original and common cause-the cold--or in other words the necessity of adapting life to the conditions under which it is developed, if there is to be any life at all, is forgotten. In this way comes dancing, and it can hardly be supposed that its devel- opment was unaccompanied by many changes. Jumping up and down in a crowd for ages must have materially assis-   V"         NE VRi AGAIN. ted in wearing the fur off; millions of tails must have been trodden upon millions of times;and it may be partly owing  to that fact that we are without that graceful appendage at this day. Language was in the course of development at that time, and gradually the jumping came to be accoe ! panried by shouts and cries--sometimes of pleasure, as when A a proto-homo found a genial warmth diffusing itself throughl his veins; sometimes of pain or rage, as he found his tail trodden upon; sometimes of affection, when his immediate relations alone were dancing; sometimes of anger and dis. gust and jealousy, when outside jumpers squeezed themselves into his family circle. And from  these cries and shouts, the transition to chants and singing would not take more than another hundred thousand years. And now the sound of Eolus among  the reeds is noticed. Imitation and in- vention come in play. The tabor and pipe is added to theB voice, and in the course of fifty thousand years more the association of music and dancing, which at first was one only of concomitance, becomes one of fundamental neces- sity. "The Bible and the ancient classics are full of delightful pictures of joyous crowds dancing; sometimes the domestic  dance in the cool shade-sub tegmnzinefagi. 'When softly slow the Lydian measures move, Or when to brisk airs and speaking pipe They frisk--they bound.' Sometimes it was the mediatorial dance around the altar, or before the god, and sometimes the grave, majestic war-dance -the Pyrrhica, that Cornelius Scriblerius and many other learned Inen have so often regretted has not been kept in fash- ion to our day. "Of course," continued Uncle Shippen, mopping his bald head with a  voluminous blue silk handkerchief, "I cannot dwell upon these pictures-not even upon that extraordinary performance of King David,--or upon that wonderful dance of Diana in the temple of Delphi,-nor upon the dance of Venus at the rising of the moon-- ... -p----- - , ,   -NEVER AGAIN.          605 'Tam Cytherea choros ducit Venus, immanente Luna, j unctaeque nymphis Gratia decentes Alterno terram quatiunt pede.' I cannot go into a cdnsideration of Plato's division of dances into orchestric and palistric, or more than enumerate the noble and severe emnmeeai, the lively cordax, the satyric sich- inis, the Dionesice, sacred to Bacchus, and the memph/zitick of the Athenians, which was danced with sword, javelin and buckler. I will only allude to one of the earliest instances of dancing on the grand scale--that of the great Osiris, of which we have the authentic account in Diodorus. Whether Bacchus and Osiris were the same or separate individualities; whether the Greeks stole the story of their god's Indian expedition from the Egyptians, it matters not--the great Osiris was unquestion- ably the most renowned dancing-master of ancient times- the Charruaud, the Ferrero, the Dodsworth of Egypt, and he led his crowded school of dancers fromn Father Nilus to-" ', Farther Inde," interposed Mr. Whoppers. "Don't interrupt me, sir. Diodorus tells us that he was a right jolly fellow-that he took along with him the nine muses, headed by Apollo, and of course there was among them Terpsichore, and there was Pan, who could not only pipe for others, but who could shake a featly hoof for himself; and then there was-Silenus, and the satyrs-regular dancing fellows, who would, were they members of our society, be the very first on Brown's list of saltatory availables; and gayly this crowd dan- ced its way through Lydia and Ethiopia-through the country of the Pygmies, through the country of the Rhizophages, or root- eaters; the Icthyophages, or fish-eaters; the Chelonophages, or terrapin-eaters; the Hylophages, or wood-eaters; the Acridophages or locust-eaters, and all the other phages, and so on across to India, and again up west to where at home the treacherous Typhoon, who probably couldn't dance, awaited the c0ming of his too-confiding brother. "And now, why do I mention this old story? Just for a con- trast. In fancy I have gone over the ground with this dan- cing expedition a hundred times, but I declare to you that the   606         NEVER A GAIN. picture of this army, even when dancing its best, is not half so striking, not half so curious, as we get by running -back along the clue of science a million years or so to the beginning of things, and in imagination assisting at one of those earlier dancing assemblies. A thousand, ten thousand, perhaps fifty thou. sand hairy, long-tailed catarrhine proto-homos are assembled in the cool of the evening; a herd of megatheria are brows. ing on the upper slopes of the valley; a gigantic icthyosau. rus, forty feet long, flounders on the sand of the lakie shore; a cloud of pterodactyls-a kind of bat as big as an elephant- whirl in rapid and graceful circles through the air. Our an- cestors shelter themselves from the cold wind under the lee of a grove of huge conifers that stretch their heads away up five hundred feet into the sky. But the thermometer falls; the air grows colder; they huddle up closer, closer still. They at length begin to jump and scream-the fur fies--tails curl and snap-the human race, in one of its brightest aspects, in one of its loveliest instincts, is amaking. Wonderful sight!-it beats the grand dance of Osiris or Bacchus. , It beats all the ancient dances which I have enumerated. It beats even the German, which, in the intense childishness of its figures, the concentrated silliness of its movements, and the general air of solemn and profound donkeyism that pervades it, is one of the most mysterious instances of development-one of the most remarkable cases of the adaptation of life, striving to be elegant and cultivated, to the imperious conditions of super- fine and tasteless inanity, that we can see in modern times." And so Uncle Shippen  would run on. Perhaps we ought to apologize to the reader for giving his ravings, but we certainly owe no apology to Luther, whom  we left standing in an angle of the piazza. He has been too well occupied. The view was one of unsurpassed beauty. But we have described it, and will not now dwell upon it- stopping only to say that the sentiment of the scene was, at that hour of the evening, one of mysterious tenderness and calm repose of feeling. Luther looked down upon the placid river-a silver band   NE VE XT US AGAIN.       607 of watei quietly floating a world of wealth-nothing but a narrow river, but of such an awful depth, and it divides mountains! The mountains, however, make no fuss about it; they take it easy, and calmly fulfil the duties of ar- resting the clouds, and hoarding the rain, and shading the valleys, and reflecting the sunsets. The reader ,must have perceived, ere this, that Luther's mind was of the discursive order, and that he sometimes rambled far afield for his figures-so far perhaps, that when he got back again his flowers of rhetoric were not always of the freshest perfume or color; Never mind, my dear young man; the clever critics, and stern purists, and logical thinkers of the Nation, or the Atheneumz,  or the Spectator, may be down upon your future opfus magnum, like a devil's darning- needle on a blue bottle fly, but in the matter of figures, it is, as in diamond-hunting, better to have sought -and missed the lustrous gem-sonly to find "The carbuncle glowering blood and milder amethyst, \Anrl sapphire with its ray serene"- than not to have sought at all. Thorn-trees and wild sage- 'bushes are not beautiful things in and of themselves, but they brighten up wonderfully the scenery of Sahara and Nevada. So an ugly or stunted metaphor or simile may perchance relieve a stretch of aridity that without them the carping critic would utterly refuse to travel over. Luther was thus learning by heart the lesson of the land- scape when two ladies, stopping in their walk, and leaning over the ballustrade beside him, continued their conversation apparently unconscious of his presence. He knew by their voices that the speakers were Mrs. Ledgeral and her friend Mrs. Struggles. "No, I don't like his being here," said Mrs. Ledgeral. "I have every confidence in Helen, and I have every confi- dence in him. He is a young man of very correct notions. He knows how cruel it would be for a young man of no fortune to destroy forever the happiness of a young girl of Helen's position. If Helen was in a different set now"-and Mrs.   608        N  AE VER A G,4 Ar. Ledgeral paused, and gave a gentle sigh, perhaps a tribute of memory to her old East Broadway days when her heart, was young. Luther would have withdrawn from his corner, but he could not do so without attracting attention, and he rested in hopes that the ladies would resume their walk. "As you say, my dear," replied Miss Struggles, " if Helen were not a girl of society, a fashionable girl-in short, your daughter, my dear-it might not be so bad. They say such kind of things are happening among common people every day. But Helen! Oh, I assure you there is not a -girl of our set whom I should regret more to see throw herself away." "There is no danger of that," replied Mrs. Ledgeral a lit- tle sharply ; " she will take the Count. Her father has set his heart upon it. I never knew him so determined about any- thing before, and she has promised to obey him. But the young man has, I am afraid, touched her fancy with his fine person and his good manners, and his poetry, and all that; and besides, that steamboat adventure, and his rapid rise in the firm, has given him a hold on her feelings. She looks upon him as a kind of protege, so that, although I don't dis- trust her, or fear him, I am afraid that his presence here may trouble her mind-may give her unnecessary pain." "Why not tell him to go away?" demanded Mrs. Strug- gles. "Tell him to go back at once to the city. I am sure you have a right to say as much as that to a common clerk in the firm." "You are perfectly absurd, my dear; you always are. How can I tell him that? I don't want him to go back to the city. Not that I am at all afraid of him, but I want to take Helen down to the city in a day or two. It is getting very late in the season, and you know when people begin to leave here they all go off in flocks, like the birds. One week the house is full and the next empty and shut up; and I want to get back now, for I have so much to do-so many prepara- tions to make. Mr. Whoppers tells me that he has half a mind to set off for a long trip to the White Mountains and   NE VER AGAIN.         609 Canada and the lakes, if he can get this young Lansdale to go with him. That would suit me best. I hope he will go. I hope, for Helen's sake, they will start at once. Come, let us go in ; it is getting chilly, and I see they are trying to get up a dance." Luther turned, a moment afterwards, and saw the yellow whiskers of Mr. Whoppers lighted up by the glow of his Havana. "Look here, old fellow!" exclaimed Luther, "are you disposed for that trip yet?" "I am; I shall never have a better opportunity. Are you willing to go?" i "Go I am ready to go anywhere-Canada, Labrador, B Baffin's Bay, or the devil." "So! Well, if you are ready to travel as far as that you are willing to start early?" "Yes, to-morrow. We must take the seven o'clock up- train." "1 Well, that's early. I should like to stay here a day or two longer." "Not a day, not an hour beyond seven to-morrow morn- ing," exclaimed Luther, in a passionate tone, "if you want my company!" "Ah, youngster, you feel bad now, but-" "Feel bad' not a bit of it. I've got no feelings, good, bad, or indifferent. I've chucked feelings, sentiments, desires, everything, over the cliff there. They are down with the wreck of the old Montaigne, full forty fathoms deep, and I mean to keep 'em there the rest of my life." "What the devil possessed me to bring you up here! exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, pressing Luther's arm. "Oh, you are not to blame, my dear old fellow. You didn't know that I was so foolish; but it takes pretty tight squeezing to get out the last drop of hope, it's such sticky stuff; but I believe this evening I have scrubbed my heart out clean. And now I'll go into the parlor and see if I can get just one dance."   "o        NE VER A GAIN  , "Like a silly moth, eh?" "Not a bit of it. I've got no wings to singe. I'm noth. ing but a grub, you know. Come on, I'll show you. I feel like dancing. Now, if never again, my first book of life is finished, and I want to stamp a colophon to it. That's some- thing in your style, eh? only it's a great deal better than most of yours." "Ah, I understand- 'And now I have come, with this lost love of mine,' To tread but one measure, drink one cup of wine.'   Go ahead, young one, and get through with it; if we get off so early in the morning we must write our letters to-night." The Ledgeral party sat, the centre of a large group, in one corner of the room--Mr. Ledgeral himself a little apart, and although apparently looking, and occasionally replying to some of the female chatter going on around him, he was evidently, in mind,-far from the spirit of the scene. Luther went up to him, saluted him respectfully in an easy, quiet tone; told him of his intention to travel with Mr. Whoppers; stated his own conviction that thev would not need him for several weeks at Burling Slip, and expressed a hope that on his return he should have the pleasure of hear- ing that the great merchant's health had been completely re- stored. Mr. Ledgeral was quite dumfounded. Luther's assured, but respectful tone and manner, was irresistible. If he had been an old established merchant, one of that class for whom Providence especially designed creation in general and New York in particular, his aplomb could not have been more per. fect and more effective. Mr. Ledgeral started, fidgeted for a moment in his chair, and ended by half rising and extending his hand. Luther took it, pressed it respectfully--it was the hand of Helen's father-and turned away, luckily in time to prevent Mr. Ledgeral so far committing himself as to mumble out something about the young man's coming some time or other to dine with him. Luther turned to Mrs. Ledgeral. Formidable as she had    VEVREVR AGA IN.    '    6I always seemed to his excitable imagination, he now felt himself elevated by the dignity of his despair to an equality with her, or any other leader of society. He paid his com- pliinents and took his conge with a decisive grace that aston- ished, as well as pleased, Mrs. Ledgeral, and that, for the moment, laid the affected fine-ladyism of Mrs. Struggles quite flat. Mr. Boggs looked on and enjoyed the little scene. It *had often required all the supercilious insouciance of a society- m1nan to put down Mrs. Struggles, and now Luther's quiet self- assertiveness toppled her over at the first touch. "You have not danced this evening," whispered Luther, as he leaned over Helen's chair. "Won't you give me one "I can't," she replied; " the Count has just this moment asked me and I have declined. I cannot dance to-night." "You cannot refuse me. Just one turn or two. I shall never trouble you again, you know. I am going away; per- bhaps we shall never meet again; but if we do, you can trust any sense of propriety, my savoir faire. I should never pre- sume to ask such a favor from Madame la Comtesse." This was said with a sarcastic intonation of the voice, a something of injured and angry innocence lending emphasis to the words. iWhy is it that men are so apt to assume this tone, as if the woman is alone responsible for any muddle in matters that love gets into? We should say that it is because he is in general the pleading and imploring party, and finds the sarcastic tone and the reproach by implication a powerful weapon. But if Mr. Whoppers were asked he would probably more concisely reply: "It is the nature of the beast." Helen looked up over her shoulder with a reproachful glance. Her lip quivered, and it required a violent effort tc keep the sharp spasm of agony from finding expression in her face- Ah! had the best steed in the west been standing saddle( and bridled at the hall-door, beshrew me if I don't think tha Luther could have swung her to the croup without much r   "2        NE VER AGAIN. sistance on her part. But-and mark the advance of civiliza. tion-there would have been no mounting of clansmen, not a soul would have ridden or ran. People would simply have said, "  How shocking!" Luther bowed politely to the Count and addressed him in French. "I am going away to-morrow. I shall, perhaps, never have an opportunity of dancing with Miss Ledgeral again. She refuses me, and says she has already declined to dance with you. Won't you allow me to ask you to help me in this? I am sure, if you will have the generosity to join me in the request, she will not refuse. The Count looked a little confused for a moment at this sudden address, but instantly recovering he replied pleasantly, "Oh, as Mademoiselle pleases; I have no claims upon her." "You see," said Luther, turning to Helen and offering his hand; and the next moment his arm was around her waist, supporting her in the giddy gyrations that sometimes excite and oftentimes cover so much tumultuous whirling of the heart. "So stately his form and so lovely her face, That never a hall such a polka did grace," whispered Mr. Whoppers to Mrs. Struggles. ( La, Mr. Whoppers, you editors do say such funny things. Is those lines yours?" "No, ma'am ; I am not in that line. I borrowed them from Sir Walter." "Oh yes, Sir Walter Raleigh. I've seen one of his books; I forget the title-something about the floss." "A floss of silk?" gently queried Mr. Whoppers. "I suppose so." "Oh, then I recollect; it is 'The Knot in the Floss."' "That's it. Don't you think it beautiful, Mr. Whoppers?" "I do; the characters are so natural." "Oh yes, especially what's-her-name, when she unlaces the helmet of the wounded knight." "Oh yes, or when the other fellow, what-do-you-call-him, '        f   r NEVER AGAIN.         6i3 throws his battle-axe at her head, and exclaims in a voice of thunder and with a deep frown on his brow, 'Avaunt thee, thou miserable old made-up sham of a woman. Mrs. Struggles fidgeted for a moment, and then decis- ively turned the conversation from literature to the dance. "ook, Mr. Whoppers, don't you think that couple per- form the ' Boston dip' beautiful?" Ic Beautiful, indeed; I don't know that I have ever seen ia couple do it better. But I don't like it as well as the' Balti- more loll.'"  "The ' Baltimore loll,' Mr. Whoppers? . "Why, don't you know the ' Baltimore loll,' Mrs. Strug- Itgle was very difficult for Mrs. Struggles to admit that there was anything in the fashionable line that she didnot know; but, in reply to Mr. Whoppers, she was obliged to shake her head. "And don't you know the ' Philadelphia squirm ' Ah, that is because you haven't been to Sharon this season. Lucy Judkins has been setting them all wild with it; but the latest and decidedly the best thing out is the 'California hug.' Haven't seen it yet? Why, they say that young Sopkins gave it at Miss Jones' soiree dansante, at Newport, last week, to the perfect delight of every woman he danced with. Mr. Boggs knows all about it; you must get him to show you." "Hallo, Boggs!" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, rising from his seat and beckoning to that gentleman, who happened at the instant to enter the room through one of the open windows. "Come here; Mrs. Struggles wants you to show her the 'California hug. It's a shame for you fashionable fellows to keep all that kind of thing to yourselves. Show her how it's done, d la grizzly, and don't look so glum about it; one would think you were going to be hugged by the Scottish maiden, rather than to hug an elegant and accomplished American matron." Luther retired to his room, and after scribbling a note to the Captain, and one to be by him delivered to Madame   6 14        NEVE R  GA I. Steignitz, sat by his open window for hours gazing out int the star-lit night. A slight glow along the eastern hills startle hiln from his profound revery. He relighted his candle seized his pen and wrote rapidly, then paused for a moment again a line or two, and again a hesitation and an erasure, ant then a rapid movement of the pen. When a despairing lover takes to verse it may be consid. ered a favorable symptom; the crisis is passed, and unless some imprudent exposure occasions a relapse, the patient is generally considered to have a fair chance for life. Luther, not only as we have said, but as we have given the reader an opportunity of judging for himself, had something of a knack at rhyme.  Of course no one will pretend, least of all himself, that he was a real poet, or attempt to class him among the thousand-and-one great masters of the art who are daily witch. ing the world with their melodious warblings. But this may be said, that although he was as far as anybody froln ever writing the great original Choctaw or Comanche epic that our cousins on the other side have been vainly demanding from us so long, there was probably not a clerk in a store down town  who could more rapidly string a lot of trochees and iambics than he could. He folded up his paper, and going into the hall sought the room of Mr. Boggs, who, luckily awake, responded at once to his gentle knock. Luther gave him the note, and requested that he would hand it to Miss Helen Ledgeral in the morn.- ing. "Just a  few lines of verse," continued Luther; " nothing wrong, I assure you. You can look at themn, the envelope is not-sealed; but I don't want any one else to see it, so if you will please hand it to her when she is alolie--you understand, eh?--well, I shall be so much obliged to you." Mr. Boggs was really a good-natured fellow, and he got up an hour earlier than usual in order to see Helen, whose ma- tutinal habits hle knew. He found her in the little rustic summerhouse, on the edge of the precipice overhanging the river. She was leaning   N E VER ,4 AGAI N.        615 upon the rough rail and gazing across the water at the whizzing up-train that was rapidly nearing the station. She would have made a pretty picture of Sappho- "High o'er the surge on craggy, rough Leucate." But tlere was this difference: Helen had no more idea of throwing herself over the cliff than Sappho had of Phaon's riding away from her in a railway train. Mr. Boggs handed her the note, and, with gentlemanly delicacy, turned off for a morning stroll. It was so early that, with the exception of nurses and children,. Helen knew that she would have the summer-house to herself for an hour. She opened the note and read and re-read and mused, with now and then a sigh, and-shall we say it? ah, silly girl, with the bright fresh morning floating in floods of mellow coolness all about you-with now and then a tear. But upon the whole the poetry did her good; she felt better for it. Why and how we might explain; but perhaps it will be better to give the verses, and let the reader judge for him or herself: ' Oh, Spirit of Night! Of loving Mother Night! I see thee now, in robes of gray and dusky light, Stealing across the slopes of yonder hills ; Now hiding in clefts where bide the silver rills; And now, with star-specked garments all aglow, Trailing, with undulating step and slow, Thy shimmering train along the sleepy river. Oh, Spirit of Night! Come, come to me, for I am sick at heart; I burn, I faint, I shiver. Oh, come to me, with all thy nursing art, And bring the balmn thy tenderness distils For life's bewildering ills. "Oh, Spirit of Night! Kindly responsive Night! Already doth thy soft depuring light Mine eyes unfilm, and, gently pressing now, Thy medic touch becalms my throbbing brow,   6 I 6          ENEVER AGAIN. And scatters ghastly dreams and thoughts of death; And waking now, beneath the stillness of thy breath, To a new sense of passion's use and power-- Oh, Spirit of Night! I see as if I stood above, apart, Upon some lofty tower, And conned the lesson with an opened heart-- 'Better, than joys of pale and pulseless life, The agony of Strife.' "Oh, Spirit of Night! Of weia-d and wondrous Night I I said, in blinded and revengeful spite, That I., with desperate curse, would counter Fate; Learn, against Life, to steel my heart with hate; Learn Hope to scorn and duty deprecate; And idly float on lush and lusky flow Of sense-but now, ah! now I know That Love, my heart, from selfish sin should sever, That foiled desire should urge to large endeavor. Oh, Spirit of Night! Nor pride nor passion can withstand thy power; And now and ever, My hapless love, thy ebon hours shall measure To me as richest treasure."   CHAPTER XXXIII. The Captain visits Madame Steignitz-French and American Cooking- Madame in trouble about the Count--To bed, but not to sleep. I A H, Captain, que je suis bien aise de vous voir. I am  very glad to see you. It is so very easy to forget a poor old woman that I began to think-:well I began to think bad things. I began, to think, oh, the poor old thing, she, has got no beauty-she has got no money; she has not got anything to please anybody, and yet we have done so much for her-we have saved her life-we work hard-we risk much to get her from the bandits-now that is enough- let her go-let her slide, poor old thing. Very naughty thoughts, Captain, eh?" "Wicked madame, downright wicked, and very unjust to Luther as well as to myself. The fact is, during the day I have been every moment occupied with the business of the ship-our ship I should say, for you have a good interest in her, and then in the evening it has so happened that I have not had an hour to spare for anything." The Captain did not go on to explain the nature of the business that occupied his evenings. He did not mention the fact that he had been compelled to take Miss De Belvoir Jones to Wallack's one night, and as he had done that, it was only fair that he should take her to Booth's the next, and, as tragedy is so trying, both the Captain and Miss Jones thought it would be right to restore the balance of feeling by a little opera-bouffe. Oh yes, the Captain had been fully occupied-wickedly occupied, if we may believe some of Miss Jones' boarders.   6 Is        AL' VER A GAtIN. ' I think it is wrong, downright sinful," exclaimed Miss Stingel; "don't you, Mrs. Billings?" "Wrong! i i's horrid, it's shameful, to be going about alone with a man in that way, and she a young single woman."' " Well, I don't know about age, she's old enough to go anywhere; but she's an unmarried woman, not that I think a married woman has any more right to go around with otlher men than a single woman; and as a general thing I don't see any harm in it, done properly ; but the way she goes about with the Captain, or rather makes him go about with her, I think is wicked; not that I would go so far as to say that there is anything improper between them, but it is shameful and it does not look well. They could not do more , if they were engaged." ' Perhaps they are engaged." "Pshaw! I don't believe a word of it. It would be too 'ridiculous. She'd jump at almost anything in broadcloth, I know; but I will say this for her, that I don't believe she'd take such an old, red-faced fellow. And as for him-well, I don't believe he'd marry such an ugly, spuddy lump of a wo- man no more than he'd fly, and if he does, he's the biggest donkey I know." Miss Stingel paused for a moment, thinking of the lovely time when, staying at her aunt's over at the Wallabout, she had once had with a young lieutenant in the navy. But, alas! one day, the marine villain took his shoulder-straps to sea and " didn't say nothing." "Yes, a big donkey he would be," repeated Miss Stingel. s However, I believe all sailors ale fools." Te Captain heard nothing, and, in fact, never dreamed of all the comment his actions evoked. Miss Jones not only heard somewhat of it, but was able to guess the rest from her profound knowledge of the workings of the female heart under the influence of boarding-house life. But she didn't care for it-she scorned it'; she was above all such scandalous talk. Her only anxiety was to keep - her poor, innocent monster's   NEVER A GA  .          6I9 itz  at pressing business had prevented his seeing her "I am donright glad to find you, madame, looking so eeln Ag  I am not well,' replied madame. k "g anot sick. idea thall be alwas dosuffering, I anythink.

That is just life in New York. But we forget the news, which you shall have to tell me. Where is monpeli/? How is the little one?" "He is well," answered the Captainj " but where he is exactly at this moment I cannot tell you. I have a letter from him, dated West Point, saying that he was going to leaye  for the north with Mr. Whoppers, and that he didn't know, and didn't care, how long he might be gone." "s Did not care! mWhat would he to say by that? I have suspect something myself, but it was not for me to question him too much. Tell me all about it. What you know, eh?" "I don't know, but I guess he has been a little upset in this region, and the Captain tapped his heart significantly. But here is a letter that lie sent to me for you." Madame Steignitz took the note, and, adjusting her slpecta. cles, read it over two or three times, and then sat for some time musing, occasionally taking a huge pinch of snuff, and then tapping the table with the fingers of her still handsome  hand. "You read French? No! Well, he tells me nothing. He says that he is well in body but not in the best of spirits, and thinks a voyage will do him good. What makes him in bad spirits? You shall tell me all." And the Captain, under her adroit questioning, did tell all that he knew, and much more that he supposed.  "Ledgeral! Ledgeral!" exclaimed the old woman, inter- rupting the Captain. "Every time I hear that name I think there is something. I recollect a name like that so well. Can it be the same? Yes, yes. Let me see. Ah! zlue jesuis bse/ What you call stupid like an owl, not to think so before. Yes, yes--it may be-I think it is." "Is what?" demanded the Captain. ' Oh, something long time ago.

I wish to know of this great merchant. I never thought to talk with my-little one about him. You have seen him, eh?" "Oh, yes; I have seen him several times." "What age is he, eh?  "I should say about fifty, or fifty-two or three." "Fifty years, ha! Well, well, that is just the age. Tall, handsome man-long nose, black eyes, curly hair--eh?" "Well," replied the Captain, "I never noticed him par- ticularly, but I should think that was about his photograph." "Ha, ha! I think I know him ; and you say he has a daughter. Come, tell me of this daughter. I have suspect much for long time. I am a poor old womntn, with no money, but I have the sharp eyes; I can see, and I have much sus- . pected. I am no fool, eh?"' Something in Madame's expression made the Captain think that perhaps she knew more about the whole matter than he did, and he said as much ; but she emphatically denied any and all knowledge beyond the mere fact that Mr. Ledgeral had a daughter, and that she had long suspected that Luther was in love with some one. "Tell that to the marines," was, the Captain's mental com- ment. "You are too-sharp and shrewd, and too much inter- ested in Luther, not to have done your best to poke and pry to the bottom of the matter." He, however, said noth- ing aloud in reply. "This daughter-is she beautiful, eh?' demanded Ala- lame. "I have never seen her but once, and then at a distance," replied the Captain; " but it struck me that she was about as neat a model as I have ever seen--nice head-lines, and a neat, clean run, and she appeared to be better ballasted than usual -not quite so much down by the head. Mr. Whoppers says that she is the most splendid girl in the town, but he is sorry that Luther ever laid eyes on her." "What for he say that? Does she not love him? What girl could look at him and not love him? There is no such fool in the world."   62-2        ArE VER A GAIN. ' "Well, I believe she has a kind of a notion for him, but the youth has no fortune. I don't exactly see the force of that myself, but Mr. Whoppers says that in society it is every. thing." .  "No fortune! Bah! Is any girl too good, too rich for him? Ungareon beau, brave--unplz^inee omnmeaa. Bah! N money, eh? Who knows that? Who knows how    mucl money he has? Bah! A young man like that has the whole world in his pocket. I tell you what, Monsieur le Captain the great man had not so much good prospects before hi}m when he was twenty-three, as moan petit. I shall say to hiln, You will sell your daughter? My little one will buy her. How much you ask?" "Yes ; but she is going to be married, they say." "Ah vozid fuelfue chse de mnuvais---tlat alters the case-- that is bad i and she such a girl--une demoiselle paraitiementi comme il faut, si gentile, si ^doc-e-what you call sweet--so nice, so handsome, so lady-like." ' Then you have seen her?" demanded the Captain. "Well, well! suppose I have. I thought one day 1 would go to see if she would give something for a poor French family. She came down to me in the hall, and the first thing I hear, she say, 'Joseph, why did you not show the lady into the par- lor?  Walk in, madam, and take a chair.' 'Oh, oh,' said I you have the penetration, and, more, you have the heart of a lady; and still more-because you find it nowhere now,-you have the something--theje ne sais quoi--which will grow, in time, into the best manner of the grande dame.' And then I tell my story of a poor French family-a veritable story, and the tears came  in her eyes, and she gave me all the money she had--ten dollars, and then we talk a long time about France and Germany, and all the places where I have lived; and she made me promise to come again and tell her all about the poor people. But then I was carried off by these maudit brigands. And now, you say, that she is going to be married. Oh, man petit, mon cher Luthere! I can understand it now why you are in bad spirits, and I can do nothing! Oh, mooR   NEVER AGAJN.          623 Dieu! 'tis always so. Everybody I love suffer! Yes, every- body," she repeated, her voice rising almost into a scream of mingled rage and grief. "Yes, everybody. I make' them all to suffer. They lose fortune; they have horrible maladies; they are crushed by the railroad; they drown in the steam- boat-they die! Yes, yes, I kill them all! My breath is poison-my touch is death! "Captain," she continued, starting forward, and thumping the table violently with her clenched hand, "Captain, don't go to sea again in that cursed ship--you will go down to your grave. I see it; I know it. She comes to you through me, and she will sink you to the bottom." "Oh, never fear, madam; she is stout and well found. A fellow must take his chance, you know; and no chap will lhave time to cast up his reckoning rightly if he is all the time bothering about starting a butt. She's a good, sound ship, and if she does run under it won't be your fault." "Well, well," replied Madame, in a calmer tone, " tell me who he is? aWho is the fellow who is going to rob. my poor Luthare?"  "A young German Count, who has been drifting about here for two or three months." "A German Count! Remember you his name?" "Yes; it is Isen something-let me see-- Isenthal- Count Isenthal." The Captain drew back in his chair, and nothing but the wall saved him from tilting over entirely, as Madame Steignitz sprang from her seat and suddenly placed both hands on his shoulders and peered into his face with eyes that seemed to pierce right through him. "Quoi! What! .-What do you say? No, no, it cannot be! Count Isenthal? Oh, n2on Dieu! what do I think. Oh I ohz! quelle horreur!" And Madame Steignitz sank back into her seat, and clasped her head with her hands, and rocked herself back and forth, muttering to herself in French, for several minutes, while the Captain sat looking on, unable to say a word. As he said   624        NE VER A GAN. afterwards, he was taken flat aback, and didn't know wha tack to pay off on. "Pardon, Monsieur le Captain," exclaimed Madame Stei, nitz, suddenly resuming her usual tone. "I quite forgot my self. You think I am a very strange old woman; but Han nothing wrong here," tapping her forehead. itI have see  some things that I should be mad for, but I was not mad. I did not go mad, and I couldnotdie. Oh! whentheybroughl him to me all cut with the dreadful bowie, and he died in my arms; and when they buried my little one in the mud of that cursed Mississippi, I did not go mad, and I could not die! And now these maudi! brigands they almost kill me, but I do not-go mad.  And now comes this thing. Ah! ahn! I mst think much about it."' "Well, madam, I won't disturb your thinking, so I will bid you good-night," exclaimed the Captain, rising. "There is nothing that I can do for you, is there? You have the nurse below, have you not?" "Bah! I sent her away yesterday. She said that Luthare promised to pay her double. I tell her that he shall not pay her one cent, because she is such a cheat. Oh, she would ruin me in one week. What do you think? she would cook a piece of beefgros comme pa, for us two. Oh, mon Diezu / they talk about the cost of the living in this country! 'Tis the ig- norance and the carelessness.

And then they must have the grand roast turkey, and the chicken, for a little family of two or three people. senez! Se vais vous faire voir puelue cose. I shw you something."  And Madame put her hand on the Captain's arm to detain him, and then rushed off to the old sideboard and pulled out the leg of a chicken which she held up triumphantly. "Re-. gardez donc! You see this? it is what you call the drumstick. It is an insult to your servants to make them eat it. Well, I   NE VER AGAIN.          625 take it, I take out the bone, lI press it out, I make some fJrcie--what you call force-meat, avec un morceau de truffe, if you have some, but if not, a little piece of onion, and I stuff it well out, round as an apple, and when it is cooked, what have I got for a few sous?-un ballotin de volailZe- a dish for a king! un plat klilus recherchze qu'on puisse trouver dans He cafe Aznglais. But I beg pardon, I speak so much French, but it is the language for the kitchen." Madame Steignitz jerked open her sideboard door and threw her drumstick in, without heeding whether it went fairly into the plate standing on the shelf, or whether it fell on to a con- fused pile of potatoes, onions and dried apples. "Oh, I understand very well, Madame; I know you French have the art of making good things." "But it is not the good- I talk of only; it is the cheap. Take the mutton-chop,-I do not mean the cotelette panee, the cotelette en papilotte, or more, the cotelette d la provencal; that costs in the time and the money, and is not for poor people who have just got a few cents to keep themselves from starve, like myself,-but take the American mutton-chop, coarse, tough and very badly cooked; you eat about half the meat and throw the bones away. Maintenant ecoutez un moment, I take the bones, I put them in a mortar, I pound them up fine, I add a little Champignon, a little trufe. and some onion, or a petite gousse d'ail, what you call garlic, one or all; a little piece of boiled chicken-liver. a little hard-boiled egg chopped fine, with a sprig of parsley, a soipon of Worcestershire sauce, and then, with a few drops of oil,faire sauter for a moment and then empty the casserole upon a piece of buttered toast. Oh mon Dieu! but it is delicieux.  You have saved your bones, and it does not only for to-day, but I assure you you can live three days on the memory." "I am afraid," replied the Captain, laughing, "that my memory would be hardly strong enough for that. I am very apt to forget the last meal before the others come round. But I have no doubt what you say is very true. I believe that what with overeating and the waste of the kitchen, there is more food 36   %626        NE'VER AGAIN. thrown away in this country than all the world beside. The sailors know what can be done sometimes with a little econ omy and ingenuity. We have it knocked into us. I tell you "what, with nothing on board but salt-junk and weavely biscuit, it takes no Slouch at the stewpan to set on the table a dozen dishes. But good-evening, madam, I am glad I have found you looking so smart. I shall write to Luther that you are getting along as well as could be expected." " You will come again soon, and let me know all the news ? ') "Oh yes, madam." " And are you sure that his name is Isenthal--Count Isen thal ?" " Oh, perfectly sure. I have heard it a dozen times, and I have seen it in the newspapers: Count Herman von Isen- thal." " Count Herman ! " moaned the old lady after the Captain had closed the door. " Yes, that would certainly be the name, The grandfather was Count Herman," and her thoughts ran back to the earlier scenes of her life when she was Annette, maitresse des robes--chief dresser and surintendante des fenmces. de-chambre at Isenthal, besides being reader, confidante, and, in some degree, companion to the Countess. Oh, those were pleasant days. The Count was a very gallant and polite gen- tleman, if people did say that he had been such a wicked man; and then Madame was so good,--a little imperious, a little haughty, but she did not show that to those in her ser- vice, she kept all that for the relatives of her husband. No wonder there was such a bitter feud with that cousin, and then Madame Steignitz thought on all the incidents of that journey to Baden, and the encounter with the young American, and the desperate passion that her mistress had suddenly coriceived for him-she who had turned a cold shoulder to so many admirers. Ah, it was strange. But as my poor husband said sometimes, 'the crust of ice may cover the volcano.' "And then," continued Madame Steignitz, still muttering to herself, " when Steignitz and I got married, and the Count    X NEVER AGAIN.         627 said that we had better leave the castle and go to America, and that he would give us twenty thousand guilders, I was so sorry to part with Madame; but I have kept my word,-I have never made one inquiry about Isenthal since, only when I land in New York I see in that Vienna journal that a son had been born to the Count and Countess of Isenthal. Never one word more; and then we go West; then comes that horri- ble life at St. Louis, and then the old life at Isenthal go out of my head, until now it come backfso strong--oh, so strong- I would I knew if the Countess be living or dead. This young man must be her son. Oh, if she knew that he was going to marry the daughter of Monsieur Ledgeral, what would she say? -what would she say? I am sure she would say, 'It cannot be-it must not be.' I must act for her; she was a good friend to me. I must do something. And there is nmon petit, he shall not be cheated out of life. Oh, I have the double reason to do something; but what shall I do? Let me think. I must go to see this Monsieur Ledgeral, but I cannot go to see him for two, three days-a week, perhaps." Madame Steignitz moved as rapidly as possible two or three times across the floor. "No, no," she exclaimed, "I have not yet the strength. I cannot go like an old beggar with a cane. I should not get in. ll faut attendre jusqu'd ce que mes jambs soient assez fortes. I must wait for my legs to get strong again. But I will write; yes, I will write; and if what I think is true, I will put a name to my note that will make him jump from his skin." The old woman threw herself back in her chair and mused for some time in silence. Suddenly starting up, she began her preparations for bed. "I am 'fraid I shall not sleep much; no, no. I cannot stop to think what to do. Some money--two, three hundred thou- sand--would have prevented this a few months ago, may be; but now she is engaged! Ah, ha! it must be something more than the money now. But to bed. I shall not sleep, I know; mais la nuit forte conseil, and in bed one need not be at the   628        NEVER A GAIN. expense of a candle, just to think. Oh, the candles in country cost much mone, and I am afraid of that misera kerosene. 'Tis not the way I would go out of the worl blown up by an inexplodable fluid!"   CHAPTER XXXIV. Whoppers and Luther on their travels-Sad News-Stichen's Death- Its effect on the Market. LUTHER and Mr. Whoppers sauntered into the reading- room of the St. Lawrence Hotel, at Montreal, at which house they had just arrived, after a pleasant visit to the White Mountains. "What splendid weather we have had," exclaimed Luther. "I hope it will last us until we get through with the Upper Lakes." "Yes, the autumn is the time to travel," replied Mr. Whop- pers. "You have all the means and appliances of travel left over from the summer, and no rushing, struggling, sweating crowds, and you are always sure of fine weather in this country, or, in fact, in any other. I have been about the world some, and I have yet to find a country where they have a decent spring or an unpleasant autumn. It's the English poets who have hum- bugged us about spring. The fact is, we get too many of our notions about things from the English' literature we gobble up in our infancy. All that stuff, for instance, about the won- derful superiority of Italian skies and sunsets we get from the English, who haven't any skies or sunsets. What does an untravelled Englishman know about mountains or rivers? Whj he doesn't even know what a bad road is. I once asked a couple of English pedestrians whether the road through the Emmenthal, which they had just passed, was a good carriage road. 'Why, sir, you can get through, I sup- pose,' was the answer ; ' but, sir, it's a horrid road-perfectly horrid.' Well, I turned into it, and found a bad road, but a much better road than any five miles of road we have outside I  630        NE VER AGAIN. of Central Park. No, an Englishman don't know what a bad road is." "Do you suppose that it is a species of ignorance that he has any great reason to regret?" demanded Luther. "Well, I can't say that it is. It is one of those cases in which ignorance is bliss, I suppose; but I mentioned it merely to show how cautious we ought to be in accepting English opinions." "That is to say, when our cousins point out a bad road we ought to dash into it."' "Yes, the chances are that we get through and come out somewhere-as in the matter of protective duties now." "Well,'" replied Luther, "I can only say that you have mentioned a mighty hard road to travel." "But if it's a short-cut to the New Jerusalem, eh?"  "Is it? I doubt, and had rather take the long road." "Oh, here come the New York papers, at last," exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, jumping up and seizing the Herald. "Provi- dential, Luther ; we were just beginning to talk political econ- omy, and that is a thing, you know, that no fellow can find out." Both gentlemen secured their journals, and were in a mo- ment immersed in columns of awful accidents, interesting murders, audacious highway robberies, municipal swindlings and judicial rascalities,-international flurries and stories of battles and bloodshed. "Is the world really growing any better or wiser?" groaned Luther. "Certainly," replied Mr. Whoppers. "No doubt of it, if you make allowance for two facts : the world is getting more populous, and reporting is attaining a state of perfection. You have no idea how much this perfection contributes to the bad look of things. Formerly the scum of sin floated quietly by, and you did not notice it. Now the reporters stand with their rakes and drag-nets and collect it all, and heap it up right under our noses. Why, no doubt the time will come when every man will be interviewed before breakfast, and     NE VER AGAIN.        63 I every wicked thought he has had during the night and every wicked deed he intends to commit during the day will be in the morning journals." "That will be nice," replied Luther; "a fellow will be able to see how his sins look in print, and give 'em the go-by if he likes. That will be holding a 'mirror up to nature.' What an aid to the moral sense!" "Yes, a typified conscience--a method of getting an abstract view of one's own particular naughtinesses-an in- strument enabling us to obtain an objective look at ourselves -'to see ourselves as others see us,'--ha! wouldn't that be grand?" Mr. Whoppers dropped his journal and rubbed his hands, and his whole countenance glowed with the ecstatic vision of a time when every man's most private thoughts as well as deeds should appear regularly in the newspapers. "It will come! - It will come " he exclaimed. "The world moves. When I was a youngster, many people dreaded newspaper notoriety. To be put in the newspapers was then a fear, now it is a hope. Mere notoriety is now an element of power; and, up to a certain limit, entirely independent of the moral elements of the case. Conviction and punish- ment for infamous crime does certainly injure a man's chances for high social or political position, no matter how notorious the newspapers may have made him; but if he has not actually had the hot iron to his skin, or, in other words, if he has not really served at Sing Sing, there is no telling but that he may be nominated, if not elected, to serve at the Capitol. What is it, youngster? what is the matter?" This question was called forth by an exclamation from In treply the young man handed the journal to Mr. Whop- pers, pointing at the same time to the list of deaths. Mr. Whoppers ran his eye down the column. "What! Stichen: died suddenly of apoplexy," etc., etc. "Alas, poor Stichen! "Luther," continued Mr. Whoppers, leaning forward and  632        NVER A GATA. grasping the hand of the young man, "we have both lost good friend; but I knew him longer and knew him bette than you, and it cuts me down quite strangely. There is nc a man in New York I shall miss more. He was a little mar but he had a big heart; and he was an honest man. Yes considering that he was a stock-broker, he was an hones man." And Mr. Whoppers shook Luther's hand effusively, ant squeezed it as if to squeeze out for his own comfort a few drops of the sympathy with which Luther was filled. "Yes," he continued, "Stichen was an honest man--the noblest work of God-and such a good friend. I shall feel his death a long time, it touches me so near; but there is one comfort-I can write his obituary for the Universe, and it is a pleasure to write an obituary when you can put it on thick without lying. I'll go up to my room and do it at once, so as to get it off by to-night's mail. You can occupy yourself with the cathedral. I've seen- it when I Was here before. Ascend the tower; splendid view; well worth an aspiring mind. You won't miss me. A cathedral is a thing that is more easily swallowed alone. This one won't trouble your digestion. It's large enough, but there are no memories of a thousand -years' devotion to strain your mind with. It is hardly one of those 'Dark places in times far aloof, Cathedrals called,' such as Keats talked about, but it will do for an uncultivated mental stomach like yours." Yes, Stichen was dead! A great and shining light had suddenly gone out in Wall street--one of the seven-branched golden candle-sticks on  the altar of Mammon had been toppled over, or rather, as a more appropriate figure, one of the high-priests serving within the very vail, in the full blaze of the golden Shekinah, had fallen. Not even his million, which he had rapidly quadrupled by bold and successful speculation, could save him. The last observation is a truism, and smacks of the pulpit,   NEVER AGA IN.         633 but let- us think for a moment how lucky 'tis 'tis true. Ah, if wealth could secure immunity from death, if it could stave off a judgment in Heaven as easily as it does a judgment in the Supreme Court of New York, how it would intensify the passionate desire of fortune! how it would inflame the fury of greed! "Go back six thousand years And make a world where death should never come, And tell me what a hell such world would be." The poet supposes the whole world absolved from the rule of death, but a much more curious state of things would arise under a law of nature limiting death to people who are worth--say under half a million--a law absolutely prohibiting Him from touching a man who had made his full pile. We have no room to pursue this subject, and pause only to correct one mistake that impulsive thinkers may fall into. The first idea that springs into the mind is the injustice to merely well-to-do people involved in such a law. Not so; death would be more then than now a boon to persons in moderate circumstances-a refuge, a resource, a something to fall back upon after years of petty dicker or halting specula- tion ; an alternative goal which, as in some few cases of exalted patriotism, every man could propose to himself, shout- ing exultingly, -as he enters the arena of trade, "Give me for- tune, or give me death!" Yes,- Stichen was dead! and he had the finest funeral that had been seen in a long time. The sententious sexton of Grace Church was heard to say that it was a pity he, hadn't lasted till Lent. Such an agreeable funeral would have come in so nicely to relieve the gloom of the season wihen balls and weddings are prohibited by-by fashion, he was going to say, but he caught himself in time and said-the Church. Stichen's funeral was magnificent-so magnificent that the idea occurred to more than one of the pall-bearers (all men of mark--nothing under a bank president) thA it was a pity he couldn't come to just for a few minutes to enjoy it.   634         Nt VER A GAIN. It was particularly magnificent and costlv in the matter of flowers. The coffin was covered, and the steps of the chancel were filled with crosses, anchors, hearts, wreaths, and crowns, while the flowers were of the rarest and most beautiful-quite equal to anything at the Horticultural. Now, flowers at the funeral of a child, a maiden, or a young bride is undoubtedly a pretty idea-" quite tasty and genteel," as our friend the sexton says; but isn't such a pro. fuse floral display, especially in the case of elderly fogies, rather-without intending slang-rather running the thing into the ground? Doesn't it savor a little of ostentation? Doesn't it speak of a strange jumble of grief and vanity on the part of the bereaved, and a slight mixture of toadyism and loving respect on the part of sympathizing friends? Isn't it a little hard on people of moderate means, who wish to see their dead buried out of their sight in a proper style, and who have neither a large circle of rich and interested friends nor a conservatory of their own? We ask these questions with all deference, because, although we are for reform in this as in many things, we have not the courage of our convictions; we ale not so bold as Uncle Shippen.  He cares nothing for the opinion of society. He turns up his nose at Fashion, and would just as lief as not snap his fingers in the face of Mrs. Grundy. Once mounted on one of his reform hobbies, he don't mind canter- ing right over or through the most sacred fences of conven- tionality. He says that this custom of flowers at funerals has got to be a downright nuisance ; that it is a swindle and a sham; that it has been gradually eviscerated of all true feeling, leav- ing nothing but a sentiment of ostentatious prodigality. "I tell you, sir," says the old gentleman, warming up to his work, "it is getting to be worse than wicked-it is getting to be ridiculous.  Rose-buds, sir, and japonicas, at a dollar a piece! Poor, perishable things-their sentiment as flowers utterly swallowed up by the feeling of their costliness as merchandise! It is absurd, sir. Our ancestors of the stone age knew better, and did better. They buried the dead with lots of flint   NE VER AGAIN.         635 hatchets and spear-heads, and then had a jolly good feast at the door of the tomb. There was something sound and sol- emn in their customs ; but now, in the matter of death, we get down upon our knees and grovel before the infernal joss of fashion, and employ the sexton and the undertaker and the florist to come and pick our pockets. I wouldn't mind it if we did not try to humbug ourselves into the belief that it is all out of respect and affection for the dead. If people would just come out honestly and say, for instance, 'Here, now, I run my de- funct son against your deceased sister: match to come off at Grace Church, P. P., within the year, and I'll bet I have more carved rosewood, more silver plate, and more flowers, and a bigger and more costly funeral, anyhow,' I think it would be a great deal more honest, and not exert such a demoralizing influence upon poor people who can't afford it, and yet think they must indulge in all this extravagance; or, in other words, the superfluous and absurd prodigalities of woe would not be mistaken for its necessary and fitting decencies, as they are now." We have sometimes regretted that we had not the space and that it was not consistent with the course of our story to introduce Uncle Shippen more fully, but perhaps it is best as it is. He is so well known about town that it would be hardly worth while, and perhaps the reader, either from knowing him personally, or from the specimens we have given of the wild way in which he sometimes rants, may be quite content that he has not been brought more directly into notice as one of the dramatis person&e of our simple story. Yes, Stichen was dead! It couldn't be said of him, as of Lycidas--" dead ere his prime." He was ripe, and what is more, he was ready. Nevertheless, the shock to the public was very great. There was scarcely a breakfast-table in our society, or a broker's office or counting-room down town where the death was not a prominent subject of conversation. The Street responded to it at once. The Lunasota and Jiggermaree Grand Central fell two per cent., and Tuscarorah sixes were five-eighths off at the first call.   636         NE VER AGA IN. And is that all? After a life of labor, of close, almost sleepless, personal, attention to business, and after years of feverish excitement in the Street-is that all? It is a pity to be compelled to say that, in most cases, that is about all. However, an enormous pile of leavings may be some little satisfaction, even on a death-bed. Let us see if a slight analysis will not expose good grounds for the feeling. The idea of leaving one's wife and children well provided for, as the phrase is, is a very consoling one, and so far the preacher goes with us. But, despite the preacher, the world will think, or will act as if it thought, a great fortune-an utterly useless amount of superfluous gold--a great good. The dying mil- lionnaire, with his eyes turned away from the glories of the Street, and just opening to a clearer vision of the glories of eternity, may, judging  fi'om  his personal experience, feel some  doubt of this; but the universal conviction of the world is against him, and he submits to authority. He dies in the hope that his family may be the better for even heaped- up riches; and if the pile is large enough he may even have hopes that some of it may dribble down to descendants in the second, perhaps the third generation. This reflection must be a comfort, inasmuch as Mammon, however fiercely he clutches his victim, don't always squeeze out all of the poor man's affections. The grip of greed on heart and brain merely prevents those little daily manifestations that secure affection in return. The unfortunate money-maker frequently cares for family and friends, when family and friends don't care for him. He would like to love and be loved, but he hasn't time to say so; and when he comes to his zmn c dimillis, he sings the canticle with an unexpected unction born of the conviction that, though he has spent his whole strength in the pursuit of unnecessary wealth, yet that it has not been wholly for himself that he has sacrificed so much of the best part of his nature. That, we say, is to some extent sometimes the case. In the instance of Stichen it was preeminently so. The little man had worked as much or more for his wife than himself.   NE VER A GA iV.        637 True, there was the excitement of financial operations-the mere pleasure of rolling up; but then the great thing was to make his wife a fashionable woman--to put her in the best set. He did not care about becoming a fashionable man himself; he knew that he was not qualified for society; but Mrs. Stichen was. She had beauty, talent, education and style. All she needed was money and a fair chance. True, a great many women with money had failed; but then they were not equal to Mrs. Stichen! In fact no woman was equal to Mrs. Stichen. And this opinion was found running all through the pro- visions of his will, which stipulated as follows: First and foremost, one million to Mrs. Stichen outright; second, a life interest in one-half of the remainder; then various legacies, a few donations to religious and charitable so- cieties, and then a very curious provision, commencing: "'Whereas my friend Mr. Whoppers thinks that too large a proportion of money left by rich men is given to ill-con- sidered religious and philanthropic objects; and whereas, when any money is devoted to other ends, it always goes into pictures or books, duplicating and reduplicating third and fourth class galleries and libraries; and whereas noth- ing at aall is ever given to pure science, and whereas Mr. Whoppers says that -upon the progress of science depends the development of humanity, the advance of civilization, and the spiritual, moral, and physical comfort and well do- ing and being of society: Therefore, I give and bequeath the remainder of my estate, which I estimate at a million and a half of dollars, be the same more or less, first to my dear wife and to my good friend Mr. Whoppers; to be by them held in trust, until such times as the legislature shall incorporate a society to be called the Medico Biological Society of New York; when the said money or moneys, with all interest, increase or accumulations whatever, shall be Py the trustees aforesaid, viz., my dear wife and my good friend Whoppers, given, paid, transferred, assigned and made over to the society aforesaid, to be by said society, viz., the Medico   638  Aft     NEVER AGAIN.   ' Biological Society of New York, held in trust forever, or as much longer as shall be thought proper, in and for, and the interest thereof annually applied to, the purposes, objects, and designs, as hereinafter stated, to wit: The erection of a building with suitable rooms for all kinds of physiological and pathological research; said building not to exceed in actual cost of erection more than two hundred and fifty thousand dollars; which limitation is hereunto affixed and made final in order to counteract the universal tendency to expend, lay out, throw away, use up and otherwise be-devil any and all moneys whatsoever left for any purposes con. nected with building, in useless and absurd architectural designs. The said building shall also contain rooms fora chemical laboratory of the first class; and for a complete scientific library of reference; and each and every depart. ment shall be furnished  with all the means, appliances, books, instruments, machines, and  apparatus, of and for physiological, pathological, and biological research, that can be got, obtained, bought, begged or borrowed, for love or money, or any other consideration whatsoever. "And I hereby authorize the said society to dispose of the income  of the remainder of the fund in paying the salaries of a head worker; at least four workers in ordinary, and any number of workers extraordinary, in no wise re- stricting the said society as to the amount of salary, character and quantity of work, or general direction of research, except in the manner and form following, and in the items hereinmen- tioned to wit: No worker shall be required to do any public teaching, and he shall be permitted to teach or lecture in public only under such restrictions as the society, by and with the advice of my friend  Whoppers and my dear wife , may at  first establish; secondly, no money shall be received from pupils, but any young man of a  scientific turn, or old man either, who wishes to pursue any line of research or experi- ment stall, upon furnishing proofs of the requisite talent and the importance of the subject he wishes to investigate, have, by permission of the proper authorities appointed by the so-   NE VER AGAIN.          639 ciety, every necessary opportunity; shall have the use of room and instruments, be aided with advice and assisted I when necessary by money; Thirdly, inasmuch as it would be impossible under the varying circumstances of biological re- search to prescribe tAe amount and character of the work to be done, and very presumptuous in me to do so were it possible, I will only indicate a point or two in relation to said work, research, investigation and experiment, wherein this my last will and testament' shall be considered imper- ative. I require, then, that for the next twenty-five years, each and every year, there shall be made twenty complete and careful chemical analyses of every secretion and excretion of healthy human bodies, with microscopic and spectroscopic examinations of tissues and fluids, and I require an equal number of full and complete investigations of the composition, character, and mechanical, chemical, electrical, magnetical and vitalical changes of all secretions and excretions in a state of disease. I require, order, and command this much, not with the design of interfering with the regular scientific conduct of the Institution, but to secure a certain attention to matters which the practising physician has no time or opportunity or ability to examine thoroughly ; and because, as Mr. Whoppers assures me, according to the doc- trine of chances, in such systematic and prescribed routine work, something may appear, develop, turn up, come to light and show itself. And whereas nothing is known of the action of medicines in and on the human body in a state of health, and but very little more of their action in a state of disease, and the whole science of Therapeutics is very much of a muddle, founded upon imperfect observations and dis- puted assumptions; therefore I direct a certain portion of the yearly income of said Medico Biological Society to be by it-devoted to direct experiment upon the healthy subject. That is to say, a certain number of men, women and chil- dren, in full and robust health and strength, shall be engaged, hired or employed to take, at regular and chosen intervals, doses of divers and sundry medicines of varying weight,   "O         NE VER A4GA iN. volume and concentration, and otherwise to subject themselves to such regimen, and submit themselves to such observations and experiments, as may be judged requisite or advisable in the interests of science. Always provided, that nothing contained in this provision conflicts with the rules of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and that its worthy President does not decide that aiding, abetting, assisting or permitting a well man to take castor oil, or any other noxious allopathic drug three times a week, is con, trary to the laws of the land, or that no court of equity Shall decide that, inasmuch as so many sick people get their 'death by swallowing medicine, it would be contra banans mores, and therefore unlawful, under the common law, to permit well persons to get their living by doing the same thing. "And I especially direct that the charter of the society aforenamed, to be hereafter incorporated, shall have-in order  to enable the  said society to take and hold, under the provision of this, my last will and testament-inserted a clause to the effect that if ever the said society forgets the para- mount interests of science; if it ever degenerates into a close corporation of scheming, self-seeking pretenders; if ever it becomes a refuge for second and third rate talents, or a mere cover under which a  lot of jealous, squabbling, mercenary Doctors can push out their claims for professional practice; then the Governor of the   State shall have the power to  summarily and suddenly dissolve, extinguish, abolish, shut up and   clear out said society, and hand over all money and   property thereunto appertaining to the society for the conversion of the Jews. "And whereas the moneys hereby  devised and set apart for the purposes herein specified may not prove sufficient, I  hereby authorize and direct my dear wife to terminate the trust held for her at any moment she may see fit, in this wise, by directing a division of the million; one half to the aforesaid Medco Biological Society, if she and my good friend Whoppers are satisfied with the working and manage. ment of the said society, and the other half to the-construe-   NEVER AGA IN.          641 tion of a refracting telescope of ten feet aperture, and two hundred and fifty feet focal length-that or thereabouts-ac- cording to the designs and embracing the novelties and in-  ventions of Mr. Planly, and under the direction of my en- thusiastic and scientific young friend, Luther Lansdale; provided, however, that if my dear wife does not approve of the work, doings, or management of the aforesaid society, she can, in consideration that my good friend Whoppers thinks that the South Pole has been neglected, and the North Pole rather overdone, either employ the five hundred thousand dollars in fitting out an Antarctic expedition, furnished and supplied for general work, but particularly to be devoted to ascertaining the possibility of connecting the two poles by 'a series of copper wires, and the probable effect that such a connection would have; or, in lieu of such expedition, she can devote the whole million to the construction of the telescope aforesaid, and in this way spend the money with perhaps less harm to the community than in any other way, and certainly to the increase of knowledge, the advancement and elevation of the human mind, and the glory of God. Amen." Cannot the reader see, running all through the provisions of this will, and underlying the phraseology of this last portion, which we have almost literally quoted, as any one can see for himself by going to the Surrogate's office, the profound respect that the worthy man had for his wife; the confidence that he had in her judgment; the admiration that he had for her character, as well as her person; the affection, the love with which she had inspired him? Few women ever had such a compliment from a dying husband as being intrusted with the fitting out of an Antarctic exploring expedition. And she deserved it. Mrs. Stichen was an honest, true- hearted woman, a faithful and affectionate wife-and, although she had become a very fashionable woman, or, as Mrs. Lasher phrased it, a very worldly woman, she yet took the death of her husband very much to heart.     I This may seem strange to country clergymen, who so fre- "   "2        VNE VE' A GAIN. quently indulge in discourses upon the heartless frivolity city high life-strange to the female novelist, who so ruthles bares the corrupting and utterly demoralizing influence fashion-strange to the provincial mind generally, which more or less infected with the idea that all great cities, a New York in particular, are nothing but foci of vice al crime and general ungodliness. But the statement is nev theless true, and it almost warrants the conclusion at whi we have more than once hinted, that almost as much hea and soul and feeling, and even piety and charity and bene olence can be found among the upper ten thousand-ay even among the ultimate five hundred, as among any virtuol crowd of nobodies of the same size. Yes, Mrs. Stichen was a  widow-a  young widow, a immensely rich widow, and getting quite well spread in fasl ionable life, and yet no dear departed ever had a more sincer mourner than poor Stichen.

In fact ^ .1[  everybody has returned to the city, and for three or four weeks there is that lull in social activities that in the fall invariably precedes the opening of the social campaign-an ominous lull, with creeping murmur filling the wide vessel of the universe. "From camp to camp The hum of either army stilly sounds, That the fixed sentinels almost receive The secret whispei's of each other's watch." From all sides comes the dreadful note of preparation.

Such unsatisfactory researches into the character of waiters, resulting not unfrequently in the information that if the fellow can be persuaded to keep sober he will do very s--"                       "    1virf, fiK A GAINi  well; or that, if you don't say or do anything to irritate him, and don't notice any little eccentricities of manner, you may perhaps get along with him ; or that if you don't put too much upon him, give him a night-key for the front door, with his mornings to himself, and three evenings a week out for his club and the tleatre, you will find him a capital servant.  At length all these prelininaries are settled, and the socia forces advance to the attack. A few small dinner and theatre parties occupy the skirmish line and cover the approaches Suddenly Mrs. Pushton, on the left, lets fly a volley of cards for the first regular "gabble-gobble."  It is instantly answered by Mrs. Struggles  on the right, with a German in the eveninge thrown  in.  Boom!   boom!- What is that?  It is Irs. .on teel o,  who   has opened her batteries, charged with a big lball, right in the centre of the line. Good heavens, how it rakes 'em! Toadies and   flunkies and snobs fall in countless crowds. Notes begging for invitations for left out friends darken the sky, and the musical voice of more than. one des- perate damsel rises on the air in shrieks of supplication for an invitation for herself. The battle has fairly begun. Mrs. Boutshard and Mrs. Vitalstein are wheeling their artillery on to the vantage- ground of Delmonico's, whence, with their heavy mortars, g they can bombard the universe if they please, and a  very mortifying thing it will be for any poor people left beyond range. Mrs. IKarzon crosses the East River for a night attack  in boats, and takes her friends in the rear, drives the vast crowd before her, pens them up in the gorge of Fourteenth Street, and before morning has them all half dead with acdm- ration and delight. Bold Mrs. Robyn Hood and Mrs. Allen A. Dale, from beneath the umbrage of the dreadfully thinned out forest of the Square, shoot out their pasteboard shafts with that practised aimr which has so often laid low the gallant of a  dozen tynes. And now, like that generous knight who at the lady's cry "Through Sherwood's glades so fresh and green Spurred fiercely to the desperate scene,"   a nobly-mounted dame appears, armed cap-a-pie with the weapons of eld as well as with an intellectual many-cham- bered revolver of the latest fashion, and joins in the fray. Mrs. Frank garners her cohort of beautiful damsels and rushes into the melee, pouring in a volley of splendid dinners until the whole air of society is betruffled and the ground white with soup cd la reine. While Mrs. Cutters, and Mrs. Smithers, and Mrs. Stephens, and Mrs. Jones, and Mrs. Robinson, and Mrs. Livingston, and Mrs. Stuyvesant, and Mrs. Van Courtlandt, and a host of others, each surrounded by a gallant band of devoted virgins, make overwhelming charges clear up and into the innermost defences of. the Inef- fable Bosh. Ah, why have we not-why have we never had any writer, author, poet, or novelist competent to deal with this subject; to depict the varying phases of the fashionable battle-field; to note the many chances and changes of the fight; to describe the feats of arms; to record the names of the chiefderring doers, and above all to moralize the scene from a high philosophic point of view, and, while holding in full light the splendor of achievemenrit, give us a clear glimpse of the accompanying pain and misery, the mortifications, the snubbings, the wounded vanities, the heart-burnings, the jealousies, the meannesses, the mendacities, so that all of us common people can fairly judge for ourselves whether the game is really worth the candle? Alas! our society must wait for its Thackerays, and Balzacs, and La Bruyeres. It must wait yet awhile for the true artist who can touch its black keys here and there without unduly sharping or flatting every note of its key-board. It must wait for the deft surgery that can carve the cancers and probe the sores without leaving the idea that the whole body is a mass of vulgar corruption, permeated and nourished by a circulation of unmitigated foufouism. It must wait for a finer analysis than is furnished by Slangwhanger's essays, an observation nicer and truer than is in the novels of Mrs. Slaphem, and an induction a little more copious, and a generalization a little   "6        NE VE R A GAIN. more correct than is commonly found among those of our English cousins who kindly condescend to don their green goggles and mingle with our best society in hotels, rail-cars and steamboats. The Ledgerals had been back two or three weeks, and a busy time Mrs. Ledgeral had had of it. Shopping alone is terribly exacting work for very rich women who have no sense of the necessity of economy to guide th'em; who are turned loose into Stewart's, Arnold & Constable's, or Lord & Tay- lor's, and compelled to do their duty without any regard to price--now buying this, now buying that, at the suggestion of the slightest whim or caprice, and now being talked into something perfectly splendid, with two yards extra, by an insinuating gentleman behind the counter. Think of it, ye happy dames in moderate circumstances, whose pathway through the labyrinth of dry goods is luckily fenced in for you by ideas of something cheap. But it was not alone shopping, or servants, or house-clean- ing and renovating, or the new furniture, that exercised Mrs. Ledgeral's mind. She, too, was an inventor. She had a plan--a grand plan, but she kept it to herself. Not even Mrs. Struggles had a hint of it, and now it was necessary to broach the subject to Mr. Ledgeral. "You are not going out immediately?" she demanded, as Mr. Ledgeral, having finished a cup of strong coffee, pushed back his plate of untasted muffins and rose from the table. "I shall be in for an hour yet. Why do you ask?" "Oh, I want a few minutes' conversation with you. I have something to propose." Mr. Ledgeral hesitated for a moment. Everything now startled him. But he recovered himself. It could be noth- ing; some party or ball, or something of the kind; best meet it at once. "Come into the library, then," he replied, and leading the way, threw open the door for Mrs. Ledgeral. "You know, my   dear," began Mrs. Ledgeral, "that we shall have to give a large, a very large, wedding reception."   NE VER A GAIN.         647 "Is it settled? Has Helen accepted him?" demanded Mr. Ledgeral in an eager tone. "Well, yes," replied Mrs. Ledgeral. "I consider it quite settled. She has promised me to accept him, and the Count has gone off just for a little run on the prairies with that understanding. He will be back in a fortnight, and then you will have to arrange matters with him yourself." Mr. Ledgeral winced, and his cheek grew if possible a little paler. It was too true that there were matters that would have to be arranged with the Count. Mrs. Ledgeral little knew how keenly her careless words cut home to her husband's heart. "Now, we shall have to give," she continued, " a grand reception, and our house, large as it is, is not large enough, and I think going to Delmonico's is a little-well, I won't say vulgar, for several of our friends of- undoubted posi- tion and refinement and taste have given there the most splendid entertainments ; but I will say a little-just a little- out of harmony with my old-fashioned and very extreme notions of what is delicate and proper. Something like bor- rowing or hiring plates, spoons, and waiters for a dinner- party, you know. Uncle Shippen denounces the whole sys- tem, as far as dinners are concerned. He says that it is vul- gar in the extreme; that it has killed the little cosy, comfortable dinner, where you had a feast of soul and flow of wit, and a fair share of refined geniality and enjoyment, and in its place substituted the grand dinner d la Lucullus, with lamprey soup, peacock's brains, and pigs' livers cooked fifty-five different ways, and around which very respectable and clever people sit, for the nonce, a row of unmitigated prigs and humbugs. Now, you know, my dear, I don't subscribe to all that Uncle Shippen says, but I am not sure that he is not right in this, and I feel somewhat in the same way about going to Delmonico's for a ball or party. But, more than this, I don't think that a wedding reception has ever been tried there by any one in our set. It will be much more genteel to do the thing at home. So I have an'idea, and I have consulted Chipman, the builder, and he says it can be   "8        NEVER A4 GAIN. done just as well as not. I propose to have a frame of wood that will enclose the whole of the back-yard, and cover the frame with canvas. This will give us a large room, forty feet square, communicating with the house through the dining. room windows. Chipman says he can have it all fixed so that he can put it up and take it down again in two or three hours, and that the Fire Department will give us leave for just one day; and then the interior can be so splendidly hung in cretonne. Stewart has some rich patterns-or, for the mnatter of that, a few hundred yards of blue and yellow satin---" Mr. Ledgeral juminped up from his chair and began to pace up and down the room, his usual movement when irritated or excited. "Oh, my dear, if you think' that would cost too much we can get along with bunting and white cotton, and make it up in flowers," and the lady paused inquiringly. It is a hard case, when a man supposed to be rich is in reality desperately " short," and yet don't dare own it even to the wife of his bosom. However, the whole amount, even with the blue and white satin, must be so ridiculously small, in comparison with other and more pressing sums, that it was hardly worth thinking about; and, besides, Mr. Ledgeral felt a sense of relief on finding that Mrs. Ledgeral's mys- terious and important communication was laden with no mightier issue than a demand for permission to spend a few thousands more than he had contemplated. "Do as you please, my dear," he exclaimed, resuming his seat; " but be sure you make Chipman give you an estimate, and then hold him strictly to the terms of his agreement." "Oh, I  will take good care of that," replied Mrs. Ledgeral, with her hand on the door. "He   is to furnish the outside frame and covering, and a good floor, and put it all up com- plete by five o'clock in the morning, so as to give us time to decorate the inside, and all for twelve hundred dollars-not a cent more. Oh, I will look out for that; you need not trouble yourself, my dear. You just keep quiet and take care   NALE VER A GA IN.       649 of your health. I think you worry too much about the Count. You certainly have, looked better since he has gone." The lady closed the door, and Mr. Ledgeral sat down to his table and listlessly eyed a row of letters which Joseph had taken from the letter-box and arranged with formal pre- cision. The old fellow shuffled in at this moment with an addi- tional note, which he had just taken in at the door, and for a few minutes occupied himself in rearranging the row of let- ters, all the time with a side look at Mr. Ledgeral. ' That will do, Joseph," at length exclaimed that gentle- man, a little impatiently. "Yes, dat will do. I wish some oder tings would do as well." Suddenly the old man turned himself around and ad- dressed his master in a firm and decided tone. "Look heah, Misser Cort Ledgeral, I want to ax you some questions." Mr. Ledgeral started. His mind had dwelt so long upon certain questions that might some day be. asked, that ques- tions of'any kind, and from any quarter, frightened him. "I want to ax you," continued Joseph, " if I wasn't born in your fader's house--a free nigger; down in de old house on the east shore?" "I suppose so. Why do you ask?" "Fifteen year before you was born, eh? And I wants to ax you if I didn't take you when you was a baby and brung you up myself, all 'cepting the feedin' part, till you was a big boy? and ain't I done my duty by you for fifty years-jis one-half of a centuary? Well, den, how can yer go and treat me in dis obliverous manner?" Mr. Ledgeral looked surprised. "Yes, I say in a very obliverous manner," continued Joseph, bringing his hand down with some force upon the table. "'I'm one ob de family, I is, and d{re is someting goin' wrong. Firs' I tink it was de panic, 'cause you know we went thro' de panic in thirty-seben, when we was boys,   650        NE VER A GA IA and we've been through ebbery panic since den, and de rule is, more panic more Champagne. But dere ain't no panic now; it's someting worse, and you don't tell me. Well, I has been reflectum, I has, and I am not goin' to stan' it; here's dem city six's you got for me--five ,ob 'em," and Joseph drew out five thousand dollar bonds and laid them  on the table; 1"and here's someting you don't know-tree tousand seben hundred dollars and sebenty-seben cents," and the old man pulled out his bank-book and slapped it down upon the bonds. "Dar, take it, and let us go right back to one bottle ob Champagne on Sunday, 'cepting dere is company. Oh, Misser Cort! Misser Cort! you recomblect de time when I larn you to swim in de old mill-pond, eh? and when I buckle on your new skates, eh? and when we went a diggin' sof' clams ober on de East Ribber, on old Pete Stuyvesant's farm, just' above de horse-market.; and when I lick dat big fellow dat trew de stone at ye? And'do ye recomblect when I hold you on de old mare, eh? Ki! wasn't dat fun! and now you ain't a goin' back on de nigger as brung. you up, eh?" Joseph wheeled and, shuffled out of the door before Mr. Ledgeral could recover from his astonishment at this unex- pected and eloquent address. Mechanically he picked up the bonds and bank-book and turned them over inf his hands. Suddenly he pushed them away, and leaning his elbows on the table, buried his face in his hands. His whole frame shivered, and a loud sob of agony burst from his heart. Joseph's tender words and generous offer had completely lifted the thin and scanty veil of self-love from his own un- worthiness, and remorse, ' the raven of a guilty mind,'" clawed and picked away at his heart with renewed vigor. Think you that the stern daughter of Nox always lays her hand less lightly upon the sinner because she visits him in private? I verily believe that there are honorable and honored gentlemen walk- ing the streets this day who would welcome public prosecution and punishment- if it could give the peace of mind which they have lost forever. Mr. Ledgeral recovered himself in a few moments ant    r NE'VVE R AGA IN.  9     65I turned to his letters. He knew that most of them related to his own private business, and that there was very little chance of these offering any very agreeable reading. However, they must be looked into, and he began slowly tearing off the envelopes and glancing at their contents. "Stiggins and Hyney! D-n those fellows, they want more margins! Let I me see, ten thousand, eh? Ohio and Mississippi fallen off / five per cent., and still looking downward. Was there ever such luck? Let 'em sell out then. They don't get a cent more from me. Ahl here's something jolly; well number five stopped pumping; going to draw tubing and change seed- bag. Well number three-the engine blew out cylinder-head yesterday; by wonderful good luck nobody was killed. D--n 'em, I wish it had raked everything within a mile of Petroleum Centre! 'Nothing more to report, except that the foundations of the big tank gave way night before last. She got a slight cant, and that strained her so that she sprung a leak, and before we found it out in the morning we lost -about five hundred barrels; not sure but that we shall have to talke it all down and make the whole thing over again." "Ah! what is this?" exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral, with a sud- den and violent start, as he opened the note Joseph had last brought in. "What! Good heavens!" and Mr. Ledgeral rubbed his fingers across his eyes, as if to wipe away an obstructing film, and still he read: "Mr. Ledgeral thinks to a marriage between his daughter and Count Isenthal. It'cannot be. C'est defendupartoutes les lois. It cannot be. I forbid it; in the name of Madame D'Okenheim, I forbid it. If that name calls up some memo- ries; if Mr. Ledgeral is the Mr. Ledgeral who-it is now more than twenty-five years-at Baden lived, for a few weeks, in the passionate glow of as proud a heart as ever melted to the tender touch of love ; if he recollects sitting on the bal- cony of the Hotel de l'Europe one beautiful moonlight night -that time when hand first clasped hand, and a youthful and unpractised tongue stammered out its unrebuked confessions; if he recollects that midnight stroll along the banks of the Oos, he will give a private audience to the writer of this note, who will call to that purpose at ten o'clock to-morrow. C ANNETTE."   652        NE IVE R A GAa. i Mr. Ledgeral's hands trembled so that he could scarcely hold the note, as he read and re-read it. He threw it from him, and the crumpled paper floated off with a hiss and rattle to the floor. He eyed it for a moment in mingled astonish. ment and horror, not diminished because of a feeling of in- tense curiosity. It was impossible! No, there it lay, and he had read every word of it aright. It was no fiction of his disordered fancy; it was a real thing, and with something terribly threat- ening in its look-vague, gigantic-he could not guess what. Can it be that the wicked deeds of hot-blooded, reck- less youth, condoned by sleepy conscience, ever return after an oblivion of more than a quarter of a century to plague and perplex a respectable gentleman of middle age? It seems ridiculous at first sight to suppose so. Nemesis is represented with wings, and with helm and wheel. She ought to have added to her emblems a fine- meshed scoop-net, as indicating that, although her flight may be delayed, she, in the end, fishes up all our sins, great and small. Mr. Ledgeral cowered, and looked back over his shoulder with a  swift, furtive glance that had almost become habitual to him. No actual spectre met his eye; no gaunt, horrible skel-  eton flourished its fleshess bones in the air, but if such had been in sight he would not, perhaps, have been a whit more frightened. If he had seen standing in the middle of the room  the splendid statue by Phidias of the Rhammusian goddess, ten cubits high, with her head touching the ceiling, he could not have bowed himself in more desperate depre- cation.  Why wonder that he could not keep bottle and glass from  clinking loudly as, with trembling hand, he poured out a deep draught of bourbon. The stimulus steadied him. He picked up the letter and  sat down to read it once more. Annette! Yes, he recollected the name. There had been an Annette. He could not, however, recall her personality I'-I'--;: -------- - =   NE VER AGAIN.        - 653 to mind; he had never taken much notice of her; his eyes had been too full of the mistress to mind the maid. Annette? Yes, that was her name-Annette! But business must be attended to. He was a public man --a prominent man. He must at least show himself in Burling Slip if he did not want half-a-dozen reporters inter- viewing him as to the state of his health. A suspicion of a rapid breaking up might very much injure him in the present complicated condition of his affairs, and as he did not care to have his digestive apparatus commented upon in the Daily Howler, with perhaps a chance of misrepresen- tation of either his lungs or his liver, he must go down town, at least for an hour or two. If he had known the comments his appearance excited, he might have decided upon staying at home. It was a subject of conversation in the bank parlor for ten minutes. "How bad Ledgeral looks," exclaimed the President. "Yes," replied a director, "looks as if he was going to strike a balance soon. I suppose it's his lungs." "No, I think it's his liver." "He'll cutup well! People say two millions." "Bah! I always divide by two. He's been speculating, and I guess he's been hard hit. I don't believe he'll leave a cent over a millions" "Well that's enough to leave behind one. To be sure it don't count for much in this world, but you have the satisfac- tion of knowing that it will count for a great deal less in the next. The preachers have got us there, eh? Naked we were born you know-ha! ha! But about that discount for Simpkins-what do you say?"   CHAPTER XXXVI. Interview with Madame Steignitz-A Partnership arranged-A grand Reform-Josepli and the Bourbon. T EN o'clock! Mr. Ledgeral had been up since sunrise. He had no appetite. He did not care for breakfast, and yet he had a certain sinking of the stomach which, except in the case of the confirmed inebriate, requires a stimulus very different from that of alcohol-the stimulus of distention. He must eat something. He must at least pretend to have eaten something, so he told Joseph to say at the breakfast-table that he had gone out for a walk, -and would take his break- fast at Delmonico's. Ten o'clock! Mr. Ledgeral had been back for half an hour or more, and had been trying to read the Herald, but the sound of the door bell interrupted him so frequently that he could get no further than--"Enormous defalcation-500,000 missing bonds-Flight of the cashier!" etc., etc. Punctual to the l moment there was a faint tinkle, followed in due time by a tap at the library door, and Joseph, who had received his orders, ushered in a female habited in black, with a black lace veil concealing her features, and a bonnet and shawl exhibiting just that degree of faded and worn-out gentility that would have rendered it impossible for the nearest ob- server, even aided by the small hand and the new and fault- less glove, to place her with any certainity in the social scale. Joseph brought forward a chair for her, and Mr. Ledgeral   Ns, VERt 4 GAIN.        655 rose and by a movement of his hand rather than by any, words invited her to be seated. She paused for a moment until Joseph had closed the door behind him and then dropped into the chair, and draw- ing aside her veil, fastened a pair of piercing black eyes on the gentleman. He in his turn regarded her with a steadfast stare, and for a minute and more not a word was said. I cannot say that I recollect you. Have I ever seen you before? what name, Madame? To what may I attribute this visit?" Mr. Ledgeral spoke slowly, and with intervals between his questions, while the little old woman stared on, as if not hear- ing a word. "You do not recollect me," she said. "Well, it is what I should think. I have altered so much more than you. I am such a poor old woman, and then at that time you had no eyes for any one but Madame." "Madame! madame who? what madame?" demanded Mr. Ledgeral, with a feeble affectation of surprise in his intonation. "Bah! Madame D'Okenheim! And you would know my name? My name is Annette. My maiden name you would not recollect-perhaps you never heard ; but my married name you will know better; it is Steignitz-Madame Steignitz d votre service. "Ah! I see you recollect Steignitz," continued the speaker, as Mr. Ledgeral excitedly moved his chair up a little nearer. I married him, and together we came to this country-it is now twenty-six years. You recollect him?" "Yes! I recollect him, and I recollect you too, now. Is your husband living?" "No; he was murdered in Mississippi. He had a tand quarrel with a desperado, and my husband gained the suit only to be killed with the bowie on the steps of the court- house; and then I was disgust with the life at St.' Louis, but we had some- little property; two or three houses, and some - . .           c-   656        NEVER 4 GA IN. land close to the city, and so for my little boy I stay there two or three years; and then we make a little trip for the summer, and the steamboat explode, and oh man Dieu / Ithey pull me up out of the water alone. What for God allows that, I don't know. Oh! I wish for one thousand times that I had been let for to drown. But I could stay at the West no longer. I sell everything, and come to New York." Mr. Ledgeral listened  impatiently. "And  Madame D'Okenheim!" he exclaimed; "what of her? you have heard from her since you have been in this country; what has become of her? strange that I could hear nothing of her'; strange that you all left Geneva so suddenly and so secretly. And Monsieur D'Okenheim! is he still living?" "He must be dead," replied Madame Steignitz, nodding her head emphatically. "Yes, he must be dead." "And Madame?" "She! ah! I cannot say; I do not know. I must inform myself; I must see and question the young man ; why did I not think so to do sooner? Commeje suis bee / Something dubious in the manner, as well as the words puzzled Mr. 'edgeral, and, he waited a moment for her to continue, but she did not speak. "What young man?"   he demanded. "What do you mean?" and, suddenly thinking of the note he had received, he laid his hand upon her arm  with some energy, and exclaimed in a sharper and more imperative tone "What did you mean by writing to me in the name of Madame D'Oken- heim?  What did you mean by conjuring up memories that ought to be forgotten? What means this visit? speak!- I am a very sick man, as you see. I have had terrible trials and troubles; I cannot stand any suspense; speak! say why do you undertake to forbid the marriage of my daughter with Count Isentlial?" Madame Steignitz nodded her head two or three times in her peculiar way. "Because she does not love him," she at length replied. Mr. Ledgeral started, and pushed back his chair-an angry flush lending some color to his pale, wan face. '   NE VER AGAIN.         657 "C And did you come here to tell me that? how can you know anything about it? what business is it of yours, even if it were so? What right have you to meddle in my affairs? There was nothing in your former knowledge of me to war- rant you. If you were obliging and discreet at the time, it was for the sake of your mistress ; I was under no obligation to you; I owe you nothing." Madame Steignitz sat perfectly imperturbable, till Mr. Ledgeral paused. "She not only does not love him," she replied, " but she loves somebody else. Ah! how could she help it?-she so gentille, so comme il faut, so Jpeine de bon sens, how could she help to love mon petit, my little lone, my Luthare--si brave, st beau, si remnli de grace virile et de vigueur?" Mr. Ledgeral's rage deepened almost into fury, and all the more readily as he felt the conviction that the old woman was saying nothing but the truth. He strode two or three times up and down the room, and then stopped abruptly be- fore her. "This is a piece of impertinence," he exclaimed, " that I will not pardon in you-still less in the young man-if by Luther, you mean that insolent and presumptuous fellow my clerk, Luther Lansdale; the nature of your connection with him I know not and I care not to know! I will clear him out to-day, and you, if you will be so good as to cut short your visit, you will oblige me! I suppose you come to threaten me. You have a secret of mine in your posession -publish it if you please. I care not if the whole world know it! You can't even annoy me-and you need not think that you can blackmail me in any manner or form. I defy you! Go!" Mr. Ledgeral pointed to the door, but Madame Steignitz did not stir; she merely nodded her head three or four times and raised her eyes with a pitying expression to his face. "Ah! cepauvre onsieur! ce pauvre monsieur!" she mut- tered. "When a wilful man march upon a precipice, he do not see-you cannot call him away with the whisper; il faut   658        NEVER AGAIN. lui arracherpar un coup de tonnerre. Yes, monsieur, I must crush you-I must crush you to the ground. Is that doolr locked?" she sharply demanded. "It is not." "Lock it!"                 ' Mr. Ledgeral, surprised into obedience, turned and shoved the bolt into place. "Now sit down!" and Mr. Ledgeral, very much to his astonishment, felt himself constrained by something in tone and manner to obey. "Mainitenant ecoutez. ye vais vots faire.,dresser les cheveux. I left the service of my mistress, whom you knew as Madame D'Okenheim, it is now   twenty-six years-that is, in the year we were all at Baden; we parted very good friends, but circumstances may arise which make it best for friends to part. I knew too much; Steignitz knew too much; and Monsieur and Madame knew that we knew too much, and it might not be convenible for us to be longer in the family after an event which everybody'--egan to see must happen. Well, we arrive in this country, and two weeks after I learn that my mistress has given birth 'to a boy. That boy was the heir to vast estates, but I knew that he was not the right- ful heir; what do you think, Monsieur?" Mr. Ledgeral, with a vigorous effort, restrained all ap- pearance of emotion, although in his heart he was burning to ask a hundred questions. "Well!" he exclaimed coldly, " what then? Why should that interest me now? why should you take the trouble to come here to tell me that? Have you nothing further to say?" The old lady nodded her head affirmatively. "Yes, a good deal more. Ecoutez. When we were at Baden we were travel- ling incognito ; D'Okenheim was the name of a little estate in Gallicia belonging to Monsieur; his true title-ah! you never knew it! his true title was-Count Herman von Isenthal!" Mr. Ledgeral-gave a violent start, and clutched Madame Steignitz' arm so fiercely that she writhed with the pain. "And Madame D'Okenheim?" he cried.   N VER AGAIN.         659 "Was the Countess Julia von Isenthal." Mr. Ledgeral uttered a loud groan, and sank back in his chair. His eyes rolled fearfully, and a convulsive shudder, followed by an almost cataleptic rigidity of the muscles, passed t   "Oh h ot Dies:mor t Die u !" exclaimed Madame Steig- nitz, terribly frightened. "I mourra ; he will die! he will die q Ue faire! que ferrai-je! and whipping out her scent- bottle she applied it with a vigorous dab to his nose. -Mr. Ledgeral, recovering himself with a deep gasp, struck whirling across the room, and jumped to his feet. Staggerng for a few steps he gazed around him wildly, like one awaken- ing from a dream. Instinctively he stretched out his hand to the mantel-piece to keep himself from falling. An instant more of impeded nervous function, and permanent paraly- sis would have held him powerless in its grasp. It was the merest touch and go. He threw himself back into his seat and covered his face with his hands, and sobbed and groaned piteously. Madame Steignitz looked on, amazed at the violence of his emotion. She had expected him to be startled, frightened, excited, but above all to be thankful that the marriage had been arrested. Here appeared to be nothing but utter de- spair and remorse, rivalling in intensity the agony of Edipus Tyrannus over consummated incest and murder. Mr. Ledgeral had never read Sophocles. He probably had but very hazy notions of the manner in which Corneille and Dryden and Lee and others have treated that very disa- greeable story of the kingly and incestuous parricide. If he had, he might have solaced his mind with various suitable quotations-especially with the rantings put into the mouth of the unfortunate king by the last-naned poet: "Falldarkness now, and everlasting night Shadow the globe; may the sun never dawn, The silver moon be blotted fromn her orb! And for an universal rout of nature,   "O        NEVER AGA4IN. Through all the inmost chambers of the sky, May there not be a glimpse, one starry spark, But gods meet gods, and jostle in the dark. Thatjars may rise, and wrath divine be hurled, Which may to atoms shake the solid world." We have italicized the last lines, as being a very curious combination of the forcible and the funny. But we have no disposition to make fun of Mr. Ledgeral's state of mind. His agony was real, and might have been treated, perhaps, a little more seriously, did we not know, and did the reader not guess that one element of it, and that the most horrible, had no real foundation. Madame Steignitz fidgeted in her chair; got up, and sat down again; loosened the strings of her bonnet, and tied them again in a hard knot; pinned and repinned her old shawl, and nervously twitched the wristhands of her neat gloves, all the time muttering in French and English, "jSe voudrais bien savoir ce quec'est. I would know what is the matter. Ah! ah! I fear; what if the marriage has taken place! Oh mon Dieu / mon Dieu /! uelle horreur /" As Mr. Ledgeral's emotions subsided, she drew her chair closer, and touching his hand, whispered: "It is not too late, is it? They are not married?" Mr. Ledgeral stared at her wildly, but made no reply. "It must be prevented, must it not?" she continued. "It cannot go on, eh?" "No!" groaned Mr. Ledgeral. "Go on? no! no! no! But, woman! woman!" he continued, flinging out his arm-s so vio- lently that Madame drew back to avoid a blow-" or devil- for only a devil could have brought me such news-do you know I am ruined, utterly, irredeemably, damnably ruined?" "Hush! hush! do not talk so loud," exclaimed Madame Steignitz; "and do not say that. How can you be ruined? you are rich; you have a grand business; you can send this young Count away at a word." "No, no, I cannot!" "How! What is that? Oh! I see; you owe him some-   N E VER AGAIN.         661 thing; you have promised him ; you are under some obliga- tion, eh? Mr. Ledgeral, in sheer despair, nodded his head almost upon his breast. "Well, well; tell me all; perhaps I can do something. I have some power; and for your daughter, and more for my Luthare, I will do much. Tell me; what do you owe this young man? how much have you borrowed?" "You! What could such a woman do? Have you the least idea what two hundred and fifty, thousand dollars is? Do you know what two thousand and fifty dollars is?" "Perhaps; I am not so ignorant. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is not much! I can help you if that is all that prevents your freedom to break off this marriage with the Count." Mr. Ledgeral roused himself, and a gleam of hope lighted up his face, but it passed in a moment, and he sank back into his chair. "You!" he exclaimed. "No! no! it is impossi- ble. If I had time; three years! two years! one year! but the end must come in a month-a week-perhaps a day!" "Listen to me, Monsieur," said Madame. "You don't sup- pose I am such a fool as to come here without knowing some- thing about you ; I know a good deal, and I can guess a good deal more. Yes, yes, I have too much affair myself, and I have too much relations with some hommes d'afaire not to hear something and to comprehend. I know you are a great merchant, but I know you are a great speculator. A great speculator is always in want of money. The Count is rich, very rich; I put those two things together; I make up my mind; I see my road. Now listen. You have a grand busi- ness-the great house of Ledgeral, Shippen & Co. is one of the best in town, is it not? It is all right, eh? Well, you have how much interest? half, eh?" Mr. Ledgeral made a slight affirmative movement. Will that interest bring you in eighty thousand a year? Well, you need not say-'tis no matter-some years more, some years less; but your capital, we will say, is five hundred   "2        NEVER AGAIN. thousand dollars; you see I know something. I make my perquisitions; I have a smart lawyer-he'is a great rascal-- they all are, and I trust him just so far as that "-and Madame measured off about anlinch on her finger, " but he is very use- ful," she continued; " he make all the inquiries for me. Nows I will tell you what you shall do. You shall give your daugh- ter to my Luthare. Ah! you need not start so ; my Luthare is a match in mind and body and character for any lady, and I can make him a match, in money, for a princess of the blood; aye, aye, Monsieur, and I will, too!" and Madame Steignitz brought her little fist with some force down upon the table. "'Tis only through him," she continued, " that I learn what to do with my money, and I will pay for the lesson. I was a poor old woman, without one relative or friend in the world-with no one--do you understand me, Monsieur-with no one to love-no one to love me, with not one single soul who could say 'Bonjour, Madame Steignitz, I hope you are well,' without expecting to be paid; with not one person who could stand at: /my coffin and say,' Poor old woman! I am sorry she has gone; she was avare, 'tis true, what you call miser; she was greedy, but she was not quite such a mean, heartless, dirty old woman as she seemed.' Well, he come one day like a gleam of light that makes bright my dark life. I was jealous; I was suspi- cious. Oh, there is so much of the mean and dirty about money in this world; so I watch and watch, and wait, and say nothing, and he go and come, and think nothing, and when he must know I have some little money 'tis all the same, and when I. try once or twice to make him have some of my money he laugh at me, and will take nothing, and still he is so good to the old woman without intending to do,anything more than to be just the brave, beau, bon garpon that he is. Ah! ah! I thought I could pay him some day, and not far off, either ; for I am a very poor, feeble old woman, and I shall go-yes, yes, I shall go soon, but now I owe him more than I can pay; he save my life ; he rescue me from the bandits ; without his devo- tion and his courage and his perseverance I should not be in this room now. But if I should say, ' Here, take my money,'   NE VER AGAIN.         663 he would say, 'Bah! old woman, go away; I can earn my fortune for myself.' Oh! he is so proud! it is wicked, the pride that young man has; but I will be even with him; I will give him something that he will value more than all the millions in the world; and you, Monsieur, you shall help me; I must make you help me. Now I am not going to throw money away; I will make a bargain with you-a bargain that nobody shall know anything about. You shall give your daughter to my Luthare ; he loves her-oh! oh! I cannot tell you how much; but, Monsieur, recall that time at Baden. Did you never know a love so wild, so mad, so fierce that God's own warning finger in the sky could not have kept you back? Well, my Luthare loves your daughter just as much-mais avec si pelt d'egoisme,-pardon, with so much unselfishness and ten- derness that you could never know ; well--she loves him. You doubt it? Well, well, we will leave it to be decided by her. You shall give her to Mr. Luthare, if she loves him, and is will- ing-celld va sans dire. . But at any rate you shall give him full chance to gain his end; you shall take him into partner- ship, and give him half of your share of the business, and I will pay you three hundred thousand dollars, and nobody shall be a bit more wise than we two." Here was a sudden lighting up of the whole sky, just as the storm-cloud looks most portentous. But Mr. Ledg- eral could hardly believe his eyes or his ears. "You!" he exclaimed, doubtfully, "you pay me three hundred thousand dollars! How? when? Impossible!" "Not at all impossible," replied Madame Steignitz, nod- ding her head emphatically. "Say that you will agree to the terms, and the money-either in notes or securities- shall be on this table to-morrow; or you shall come to my house, which will be better; we will have no checks to show where it comes from. But perhaps you will take some time to consider-a week, or a month, perhaps?" "Not a day! Not a moment! I consent to all-every- thing," exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral, stretching himself up with a sense of returning animation.   "4        NE VER AGAIN. The id ea of being once more a free man ; an indubitable, respectable man; a man who could hold his aristocratic head up once more in Wall Street, and carry round with untrenim bling hand .the plate at St. Cyprian's, diffused its genial warmth through every vein and nerve of his body. Once clear of the Count, and his horizon was almost cloudless. True, he owed a vast deal of money-but those debts were all honest debts; he could manage them in time, even if his hitherto large surplus income should be shorn in two. He could stave them off, and renew theln, or stand suit, and pay them when he should be ready. As to living, there would be, with Helen married, only Mrs. Ledgeral, Laura, and himself. Three people ought to be able to get along on forty thousand a year; and as to the partnership, there could be no objec- tion on the part of any member of the firm, as it disturbed no capital; and what more natural than that he should want to release himself, as far as possible, from the cares of business, or that he should decide to put such an eminently competent young man as his son-in-law in his place, or that he should dower his daughter so handsomely? The only question was about Mrs. Ledgeral-she might resist; but-well, she's a wise woman, thought Mr. Ledgeral, and she will see that the odds are against her. A few minutes' further conversation settled certain details. The only question was as to the time that the partnership arrangement should go into effect. Mr. Ledgeral thought that for appearance' sake he ought to take at least a month for the excogitation of a scheme so important. "Well, as you please," replied Madame. "I shall leave it all to you. When I make up my mind to confide, I confide; but when I don't, I trust not one cent-not so much as one centime. You come to my house Wednesday afternoon, and you shall make me an acknowledgment for three hundred thousand dollars and its object, and you shall find the certi- :fied certificate of deposit all ready for you. Take your own time, then, but I shall charge you interest until the papers of the partnership are signed. That is right, eh? You know I must have mv interest. You will pay me the interest, eh?"   NE VE R AGAIN.         665 Madame Steignitz took her departure. Mr. Ledgeral watched her as she tottered down the front steps. Why had he not thought to send for a carriage? She might tumble down or be run over in the street; and then what an utter wreck of his battered and tempest-worn craft, just in sight of port! He pulled out the bottle of Bourbon from its hiding- place, and was about to turn out a measure, when he sud- denly and with violent energy recorked the bottle, and placing it and the glass upon the table, rung the bell for Joseph. "You want me, Misser Ledgeral?" exclaimed the old fel- low, in what he intended to be in a particularly cherky tone. i "Oh! Oh! Misser Cort, you ain't gwine back on dis old nigger?" he continued, as Mr. Ledgeral extended his hand. I "No, my old friend," replied Mr. Ledgeral, shaking old Joseph's hand, "I am not going back on you, as you call it, but I'll tell you what-we'll all go back to the old times. I return vou your bonds and bank-book only because I have no real need of them; but you must not think that I shall ever forget that you offered them. Here, take them; and take away this, too," pointing to the bottle ; " and don't you ever let such miserable stuff come into this room again, or into the house, either, for that matter." The old man shuffled his feet excitedly, and winked and blinked his eyes, while a big tear ran down his cheek. "Why, why, Misser Cort?" he cried. "Why? what? der ye really mean it? Der ye mean it?" Suddenly seizing the bottle, and assuming an erect and respectful attitude, he con- tinued, in a firm tone, "Misser Led(reral, you hab nebber giben an order in dis house dat shall be more continerously obeyed. Not a drop, sir; not a drop! and de Champagne, sir, only on Sundays, sir, eh?" "Only on Sundays," replied Mr. Ledgeral, nodding and smiling kindly. "'Ceptin' dere is company-always 'ceptin' dere is com- pany? But when -we is alone, only on Sundays. Ki! dat's de day! I don't mind de pop den. It sounds solemn, jess   "6        NEVER A GAI IA like de church bell; but on de week-day it go thro' my head like a pistol shot. "But, Misser Ledgeral," continued Joseph, putting his head back into the room, " will you permit dis darkey to ax ye one question? Are ye sartin sure de panic is all ober? Oh! tank de Lord for all His mercies. Dis is de six panic we get trew." Joseph's first act on getting back into his pantry was to smash the bottle against the marble edge of the sink. This little piece of violence seemed to have a soothing effect upon his feelings. He sat down, pulled out, his handkerchief, wiped and adjusted his spectacles, and began the examination of his bank-book, all the time muttering his thoughts aloud. "De dam nasty stuff! How he smells. 'Tain't approprimate for no gemman to drink. 'Tain't fit for niggers; no, not eben for de low Irish; and den it gibs eberybody Misser Bright's disease drefful.

I "n   AS Helen been round this morning?  demanded F  Uncle Shippen of his Wife. I  "No," replied Mrs. Shippen, "I have not seen her for two days. That is something very unusual, you know, but I suppose her time-and thoughts too--must be pretty well occupied just now." "I don't like this business at all," exclaimed Uncle Ship- pen, pushing back his chair from the breakfast-table. "She don't care for-him, I am sure, and it's a sin and a shame." "But it's such a splendid match. I don't wonder Ledg- eral and your sister are so anxious for it." "Splendid match! not a bit of it. Oul -Helen couldn't make a poorer match. Why, do you know, his mother died of consumption at thirty-he told me so, and his father did not reach fifty. I have not had an opportunity of measuring his longevity indications; but as far as I can judge from mere observation, he's below the average: I don't like to interfere in these matters, but I must in this case." "Nonsense!" exclaimed nMrs. Shippen- "you can do nothing. You know when your sister has once got her mind set upon a thing, you may as well talk to the -winds. That, however, would be perhaps no reason for our not meddling in the matter. The chief reason is Helen herself. I don't know what to make of the girl. I have talked with her, and I can't find out whether she really wants to marry the Count or howewolbeprasnresnfrorntedln   "8        NE V':ER AGAGIa.  not. She seems to think that she must marry him-that she is forced to marry him; and yet she won't admit that she is pushed to it against her will. She says that she likes him, and esteems him very highly; and yet she is evidently un. happy. I said to her, ' Helen, say that you don't want to marry the Count, say so boldly, and I will support you in it. I don't care how much your father and mother have comrn mitted themselves to the Count, I'll settle that matter for you. Just speak out boldly,' said I. 'Oh, no, no,' she cried, 'don't say anything; don't do anything ;', and that was about all that I could get out of her. The girl has got to be a mystery! I don't understand her." "Well, I do," exclaimed Uncle Shippen, slowly walking  up and down the room; "I do! and I'll walk round and see Ledgeral about the matter this morning, before he goes out. I am not going to allow such a girl as Helen--a girl with such a rich inheritance of vitality and longevity-a girl that under proper circumstances would make such a splendid mother of a healthy, long-lived and useful family-I am not going to let her throw herself away, if I can help it. Don't talk to me about your Counts and your millionnaires. What is a title without physical vitality? What's a million without the prin- ciple of longevity? What business have people to marry and bring into the world a lot of miserable, short-lived children-- I don't care how pretty, and how plump, and how^ strong, ap- parently-I say miserable children, who will grow up in a lot of short-lived adults? what right- have they to do it, without any regard to the ultimate regeneration of the human race? There ought to be laws against it; society ought to make laws against it ; it ought to be so-and I have no doubt that it will be so in time-that a poor, plain girl, whose- grandfathers and grandmothers have averaged their threescore-and-ten all around, will be as much sought after in matrimony as a scrofulous belle with two or three millions is now. And what will be the reply of a considerate father to one of your short- lived young fellows who comes to demand his consent? Sir! you have deceived my daughter, or else she would never have   NEVER A GAIN.          669 referred you to me ; you have concealed the fact from her that you never knew a grandfather or a grandmother; they all died before you were born. But, worse, sir, your father was a dyspeptic all his life, and died of gout in the stomach, as the doctors call it, but a real wearing out of the apparatus.; and your mother is nearly blind, froln senile atrophy affecting the crystalline lens, at fifty. I make no measurements, sir, but I can see at a glance all the indications are against you; dis- tance between the parietals ; distance between the nasal sul- cus and the orifice of the ear ; distance of said orifice below a circle cutting the head through the eyebrows and the occipi- tal protuberance ; circumference of the chest, combined with  length of trunk, showing the space occupied by the respiratory organs and the chylopoetic viscera-all-all are against you. I am very sorry, sir, but I cannot give you my daughter. I don't like your constitution--it is a deception and a fraud! Morally, that is not your fault, at least so long as you keep. single; but, physically, it is an insuperable objection. You are, I know, a young man of excellent character, and at present in apparently vigorous health; you have a good so- cial position and an immense estate, but, sir, all that is as nothing when the question comes to be looked at in the light of our duties to humanity, and the obligation that rests upon every one to make any sacrifices for the physical regener- ation and improvement of the human race. I cannot, sir, give my consent, and I know that my daughter will fully concur with me, when I explain the reasons for my decision.' That's the way they'll talk, and until it comes to that, there is not much hope for any great improvement in society, and progress of all kinds must continue infinitesimally slow." Mrs. Shippen was not accustomed to pay much attention to the old gentleman's tirades; she was busy sipping her coffee, and at intervals intently studying the long list of chamber-maids wanting places in the Herald. What is the improvement and regeneration of the human race, to a house- keeper whose latest acquisitions in the menial line have just turned out perfect specimens of Irish depravity, and, in ad-    LX el IlV. dition, had heightened an excited sense of their wickedness by a notice to quit? The regeneration and improvement of servants is the great thing-something that will elevate menial service into the region of the fine arts, and enable us to secure all the talents and all the virtues, with the highest intellectual culture, for about fifteen dollars a month. All! if our ladies would only look into Plautus and Terence, and see how old the evil-a rascally servant-really is, it mnight soothe their feelings somewhat. It might mitigate their honest indignation to know that Mrs. Cassius and Mrs. Cato and Miss Scipio suffered in the same manner, and that the trouble is so old and so universal that it is hardly worth while to waste any temper upon it. Madame De Stael say s that when you see two German ladies with their heads to. gether in confidential confab, you may safely conclude that the subject of conversation is the iniquities of their ser- vants. While in many things our ladies may properly look to Germany for an example, would. it not be about as well that, in this thing, they studied the habits of German ladies as a warning? At any rate, it does sometimes seem to the male human-who perhaps, however, has no right to speak or think at all on the subject-,that it would be right to ask themselves where they- would be, in the matter of servants, were it not for the Irish immigration; and whether, having caught an ignorant class and degraded it to menial service, they have a right to expect it to produce in any great abundance the most exalted specimens of fidelity, truthfulness, devotion, unselfishness, and general moral worth; and whether it would not be as well to abate some- what of general vituperation until the mistress can fairly show the world that she herself has mounted a step or two on the ladder of all the virtues. Uncle Shippen finished his monologue, and, owing to the preoccupation of Madam with more important subjects, was suffered to seize his hat  and g et out of  the street door without the usual, Pish!  Pshaw! Nonsense! with which, according to the old gentleman, all  profound philosophic lucubrations are ever received by the feminine mind.   He found Mr. Ledgeral at home, and at once broached the subject. Quite to his astonishment, Mr. Ledgeral seemed disposed to take the same view of the case. "I quite agree with you," said Mr. Ledgeral, "and I have made up my mind that it won't do. I can see that Helen is not at all disposed to accept the Count, and I am not one to attempt to force her into a match against her inclinations, merely for the sake of family or wealth or worldly position. Oh, no! it would be some much more mighty consideration that would induce me to use my parental authority and influence as against her own sentiments and judgment." Mr. Ledgeral uttered no falsehood, and he intended no deception; but he continued to impose upon himself-a very happy result often of fine sentiments boldly uttered. He almost plumed himself upon the fact that it was only the mightiest consideration-a matter of more than life and death --that had actuated him. "I have decided in my own mind," he continued, L" that the affair can go no further; but do you know, I have not dared to speak a word about it to your sister. She will be so disappointed." "Well, 1 am not afraid of her," said Uncle Shippen. "Let's have her in here. I'll soon settle the matter with her," and the speaker summontd Joseph. ' Yes, sah, Missis Ledgeral is still in de breakfast-room. I tell her, sir," and the old man shuffled across the hall with an unusually puzzled expression of face. "I guess der's gwine to happen someting in dis house. I can't 'spect what it is, but I guess it's all 'bout dat Count.  I wish de dam furrener had stayed in his own country. Miss Helen, she hasn't look well ebber since de Dutchman been sneaking round here." Mrs. Ledgeral answered the summons, and joined the two gentlemen in the library, not without misgivings as to the subject of discussion. She knew her brother well enough to know that he would oppose the match-in fact, he had more than once intimated as much-but she knew, as she supposed,    672        NEVER AGAIN. that Mr. Ledgeral was very much in favor of it, and she was not going to give way to anything that Uncle Shippen could say, although in conclusion he put in one of his heaviest arguments. "You know, Sis, that we have made Helen as much our own child as if she was born to us; we have adopted her, in fact; she is to be my heiress; but I tell you what, it will go very much against the grain if any of my money is to go where it will not assist in the physical improvement and regenera. tion of the human race." "I wish," replied Mrs. Ledgeral, with a contemptuous curl of her lip, "I wish, my dear brother, that you would stop that nonsensical talk about the improvement of the human race. At any rate, there is no use of wasting any of it upon me. My husband will tell you that the match is a splendid one in every way, and that he-" Mr. Ledgeral raised his hand. "I grant you, my dear," he said, " that under certain circumstances the match would be a most eligible one, but I have altered my mind in relation to it. I am convinced that it is distasteful to Helen, and I no longer wish to press her to it." Mrs. Ledgeral was dumb for a moment with astonishment. After all the anxiety he had expressed; after having been pushed up herself at his instance, and now, such a sudden change! it was the most unaccountable fickleness I And then, after all the preparations she had begun to make; all the little intimations she had suffered to escape her, and all the reports and congratulations, and no grand wedding after all! No splendid wedding presents, no dazzling display of soup- tureens, and tea-sets, and butter-boats, and fish-knives-not even a few paper-cutters, or inkstands, or salad-forks; no crowded church; no long array of bridesmaids and grooms- men; no embodiment of elegant divinity in snowy surplices; no muttered whispers-"How lovely, how stylish;" no notices in the weekly Upper-ten or the daily Smoucher of a marriage in high life; no sweeping down the aisle with the proud con- sciousness that all eyes are winking with envy at'the mother- "-" ." --- -  -  - -   NEVE R AGAIN.          673 in-law of a monstrously rich and veritable Count; no music; no flowers; no Brown no anything! Oh, it was too bad for any fashionable female heart! How could she meet the gaze of the public? Why, she would be ashamed to look even Mrs. Struggles in the face! Joseph entered the room at this moment with a letter which the postman had just left. As the superscription caught Mr. Ledgeral's eye he started, snatched the letter from the salver, and with a slight bow to his wife and brother-in-law tore open the envelope. A second note was folded within the first. "Business-something private, of course," thought Mr. Ledgeral, and he slipped it quietly one side. He ran his eye over the contents of the first. Mrs. Ledgeral was not one to give up anything she had set her heart upon without a struggle, and before he had finished his note, she turned to her husbanc: "You two gentle- men," she observed somewhat sharply, " have come to a deci- sion rather suddenly, it seems to me. Permit me to observe that in a matter of this kind I have something to say." "Just so, Sis," exclaimed Uncle Shippen, "that is the reason we sent for you. I know you don't care anything for the physical regeneration of the human race, but I know you do for your daughter's happiness." "And who should know better what will conduce to her happiness than I?" interrupted Mrs. Ledgeral. "I have all along consulted her in this matter. You must not forget that she has some rights; and as to the Count, you seem to leave him out of the question entirely." "Well, he has thiust himself into it, and pretty effectually too," exclaimed Mr. Ledgeral. "This note is from him, and mostly upon this subject; I'll read the essential part of it for you. After giving a short account of his trip, and the results of his first buffalo-hunt, he says: 'I come now to the chief object of my letter. Distance, travel, the soothing influence of new scenes, the excitements of wild life, have, as it were, purified my mental vision from the mists of passion. I look back, and see that I was very wrong in pressing for an an 43   674        NEVER A GAIN. swer to my demand for your daughter's hand. I won't say that the demand was unwarranted by my own feelings. Every sentiment of my nature-pride, vanity, ambition-all would have been gratified by a favorable answer; all except a natu- ral longing for a full return to passionate affection. That, I now see, your daughter could not give me. I ought to have seen it sooner; I ought to have seen the 'No' in her hesita- tion, but we. both deprecated a hard negative--she, I can readily understand, out of respect-out of, perhaps, some real liking ; out of consideration for the feelings of an honest lover --I out of the hope that a little delay might result in an affir- mative. It is now time that I treat your daughter with a lit- tle less egotism, and myself with a little more honesty, and I have therefore to say that, with every wish for Miss Helen's happiness, I withdraw from the position of suitor for her hand. May she find some one to whom she can say 'Yes' with promptitude and fervor. I have changed my mind about re- turning to New York; I have determined to go on to California. At San Francisco I shall decide whether I go down the coast, perhaps as far as Peru and Chili, or whether I take passage for Japan, and so on to China. I hope some day to see you again, but exactly how soon it is impossible now to determine. In the meantime I hope you will be willing to allow our affairs to remain upon their old footing, and that you will still suffer me to enjoy the benefits of a business connection which was first suggested to me by finding among my father's papers the enclosed letter, which I take this opportunity of sending to you. "P. S.--I have almost decided to make some heavy invest- ments here, and I shall probably have to draw upon you for a large sum, say from two to three hundred thousand dollars. You will be so good as to cash my securities when necessary to put yourself in funds for said drafts." Here was an end to all further discussion. Uncle Shippen jumped up from his seat, and rubbed his hands for a  moment, while his face glowed with an expression of intense delight. "Splendid fellow!  by Jove!" he exclaimed, ' mentally,   NE VER AGAIN.          675 morally, and socially; good-looking, too! rather a fine phy- sique at first glance, but vitality weak, and the principle of longevity absent. What a pity! what a pity!" Mrs. Ledgeral looked at her husband inquiringly. "You too," she said, " seem to be satisfied with this termination of an affair that three days ago you were so anxious to press on. I don't understand it." "Bah! Sis; I have convinced him, as I could convince you, if you were not a woman, that the thing would not do; it was against common sense; it was contrary to the plainest dictates of science; it was a flying in the face of nature; it was a neglect of our duties to posterity; it was a contempt of humanity in general. Of course he is pleased ; how could he help but be pleased?-and I tell you what, Sis, if you had a scientific hair in your head-I don't mean gray hairs, for I see you are getting quite a number of them-but a real scien- tific hair, you would be pleased too. Go now, and tell Helen that the thing is all up, and you'll see that she'll be delighted , most of all." "Perhaps! I don't know; Helen is such a queer girl; it is possible that her affections are more deeply interested than she has let us see." Mrs. Ledgeral spoke in a very subdued voice, as she stood in a hesitating attitude, with her hand on the door. "Nonsense, Sis! go and tell her. I'd see her, and tell her myself, but I have an engagement, and am behind time; go and say so to her; give her my love, and tell her for me that she will have an opportunity yet of contributing to the physical regeneration of the human race. She'll be delighted, you'll see." Mrs. Ledgeral closed the door, and began slowly mount- ing the stairs, very slowly. It suddenly seemed as if the steps were now higher or steeper than usual. Mrs. Ledgeral knew that that could not be ; it must be then, that her slight increase of fat was beginning to tell; but then it was so little ; why even the belt of last year's dress would almost hook, an d Mrs. Struggles had assured her that she never would have noticed   676        ANE VER AGAIN. it. No ; the weight, Mrs. Ledgeral felt, pressed upon her mind and heart, rather than her body. The cares of fashion. able life she had hitherto borne jauntily ; the duties of society she had always performed easily and faithfully; all the more so, perhaps, from never having inquired too strictly whether "position " did not entail responsibilities beyond her set- responsibilities extending to society in the large acceptation of the word-not that she was wholly without some sense of obligation in this respect, but she never allowed it to worry her; she rather admired a high standard of refinement and culture, and social morality, but she was not going to put her. self out in any way to correct the vices, or elevate the tone of society. There was not much of the reformer, and nothing of the martyr, in her composition. "Let the world wag," had alwavys been practically her motto, but now I well, it really did seem as if tl e world did not wag so smoothly as it used to. There was this affair of Helen's, and the ill health of Mr. Ledgeral, and the careless observation of her maid, Opropos of a corset-lacing, that some ladies lose their figure very early, and that brutal remark of her brother's about gray hairs. There is a sentimental shock at the sight of the first gray , hair, which has often been noticed, and much good philoso- phizing and moralizing indulged in thereunto; but it soon passes, to be succeeded in a few years by a much nore lively agitation of feeling, a much broader and clearer opening of consciousness to the fact that people will grow old if they live long enough. This much more important epoch has been never properly distinguished and noted. In many cases it comes suddenly, and, very happily, in more cases, it passes rapidly. A, number of causes conspire to produce it, but in general the most efficient is a touch of dyspepsia, occurring just at that time when it is perceived that the gray hairs have become too numerous for further eradication, and the awful question-to dye, or not to dye-stares one in the face. A sense of general breaking down--or breaking up-either or both; a conviction that old age is an actual possibility ; a per- ception that we have at last turned the summit of life's road,   NE VER AGAIN.          6" and that there is nothing before us but a down-grade, comes upon many of us all at once and for a while a triste, morne mist of sentiment envelops every thought and feeling, and dead- ens to a dark neutral tint the most brilliant colors of life. We can do nothing but wonder either that age should have stolen upon us so silently, or should have rushed upon us so rapidly. But yesterday, we were as young as the youngest, or at least as young as people with a proper contempt for mere youth should wish to be ; to-day, we wonder at ourselves for being so old. How long this phase of feeling lasts depends somewhat on circumstances, but much more upon temperament., We advance along the road a little further-two, three, half a dozen, or a dozen years; why it's nothing but a dead level, or if the grade is a little down, the inclination is so slight that there is not the least necessity for touching the brakes. While the fit lasted we were filled with wonder and disgust at find- ing ourselves so old; now we are filled with wonder and delight at finding ourselves still so young. The reader must not understand us as saying that this process of thought and sentiment is realized in all cases. In some the undulation of feeling is so slight, or so sloping and prolonged, as not to be distinctly perceived. Some are so stupidly egotistical as never to know that they have grown old; and some who find early the grasshopper a burden, persist in carrying their load to the last. Happy, then, are those to whom  the conviction of advancing age comes as a sharp, short crisis, which, once past, enables them to pursue a gently-sloping down-hill path of life, in vigorous contentment;and with thankfulness for what is left, rather Ithan regret for what is gone! Mrs. Ledgeral had reached this point, and that was what was the matter with her, as she slowly ascended the two flights of stairs-to Helen's room. A visit from her mother was something unusual, espe- cially so early in the morning. It indicated something of interest; perhaps important news from her sister, or some-   678       -   VER A GA4INr. thing wonderful from Worth or Madame Volorem, but as she caught sight of her mother's face, she saw in an instant that whatever it was, it was something dreadful. "Well, my dear," exclaimed Mrs. Ledgeral, dropping herself languidly on'to a lounge, "your dawdling has come to a pretty end!" "What do you mean, mother?" "Why, I mean that, in this affair of the Count, your hesi. tation-your putting off a decided answer-,your very queer conduct generally, has had its proper result; and I must say, as far as the Count is concerned, I do not blame him. No man of any spirit could do anything else, and I only wonder that he should have gone as far as he has, under such treat. ment, which I must say has been very unlady-like, and very improper!" "My dearest mamma, what do you mean?" with an in. creased emphasis on the do.  "Why I mean that you have foolishy thrown away the chance of making the most splendid match that a girl could make. The Count is off! Ah, you need not look so as. tonished and distressed about it; what else could you expect? You could not think that he was going to stand bowing and begging forever. You couldn't believe- that a man of rank and wealth, and good looks and accomplishments, is going to let any girl shilly-shally round him for months. Your father has just received a letter from him. He gives you up! You have lost him! ' "Lost him!"  exclaimed Helen, clasping her hands, while her big eyes opened wide, as if atthe sight of some- thing frightful, and her blanched face and rigid form ex- pressed in every muscle and movement the height of fear and despair.  "Lost him! oh, what shall I do? what can be done?" she cried with an anguished wail. "Oh, father, father," and, suddenly darting by her mother, she rushed from the room. Dumbfounded is the only word for Mrs. Ledgeral's state of mind.  Had Helen gone crazy? Well, in a few minutes, and- WeI4  n  a few  minutes, and-   AE VER AGA Nv.         6 79 before she could recover herself sufficiently to descend to her room, she had further reason to ask herself the question. Helen flew down the stairs and dashed ihto the library, where she found her father, who had just bowed Uncle Ship- pen from the house, seated at his table and preparing to open the letter enclosed in the Count's note. "Oh, father, what is this, what is this news of the Count? Can nothing be done? I am ready to say-do-anything! Oh, father, I am so sorry," and Helen wrung her hands excitedly. "I ought to have acted differently! I see it all now! Oh! what shall we do?" "Calm yourself, my dear daughter; there is no reason for this excitement." "But the secret, father; our secret! Oh! what will be- come of you-of us?" "Never fear, my dear," and Mr. Ledgeral put his arm round his daughter's waist; "a never fear. The danger has passed; we have nothing now to apprehend. I did not wish that you should refuse the Count, but he has vithdrawn, himself. That makes all the difference in the world; don't you see it does?" Helen did see, or rather thought that she did. "Yes, I suppose so," she replied, " but are you sure that he has with- irawn and that you are perfectly satisfied? What of the ruin, :he disgrace, that threatens you-me--all of us?" "There is his note, and a very nice note, too," replied Mr. Ledgeral; "and I can assure you I am perfectly satisfied. As to the ruin and disgrace, we will never mention the subject again. You understand, Helen? What has passed between us is to be, now and forever, a secret that must never be breathed in the faintest whisper to any one." Helen could hardly understand it, but, luckily, she did not want to understand it. It was enough to feel that a load of mis- ery had been suddenly lifted and cast aside. The sense of freedom sent an ecstatic thrill of joy through every nerve, and, under the impulse, she threw her arms around her father's neck and sobbed upon his bosom.   680        NERVER AGA IN. "But, my dear," continued Mr. Ledgeral, disengaging her arms and looking significantly in her face, "I am not go- ing to be cheated out of a son-in-law ; your mother's wed. ding arrangements will have to be deferred a year or two- that's all. Oh 1 you need not look so frightened ; I do not intend to ask you to do anything against your will again. I have proved your affection for me; I am not going to stand in the way of your affection for some one else, however poor he may be." Mr. Ledgeral nodded his head. Helen was about to ask an explanation, but suddenly paused, and, fearful of tell-tale blushes, flitted from the room without stopping to ask any further questions. "Ki! what's dat?" exclaimed Joseph, as he heard the crep- itation of muslin skirts and his eye caught the flash of a pique train that illuminated the staircase for an instant. "Ki! dat's de way, two steps at a time. I ain't a seen Miss Helen do dat dis monstrous long while-most a six months,-two steps at a time! ki!" and the old fellow stopped and delib- erately gave a short double-shuffle, accompanied by a low, chuckling laugh. "Two steps at a time! Dey say it ain't lady-like and genteel. Dat's bekase dey can't do it. , Dey stay out so late at night, and dey dance de Jurman so much, and dey drink so much Champagne, and eat so much goose libbers dey get kind o' weak in de ankles, and dey get de rumantics in de knees-I say it's de rumantics in de knees, but Misser Whoppers, he say de cause is dey get de romantics in de head; howsomeber, dey can't go up de stairs two steps at a time, and dat is de reason why dey is so dam genteel. Oh! you can't fool dis chile no- how.   I tell you what, honey, dis ere nigger ain't been a member ob s'ciety more nor half ob a century for noting. But I must go and look after dat darkey wid de silber. He ain't wurth chucks, dat 'mancipated cuss ain't.  If I had known dat he warn't a real silber man; dat he was most a good for noting but electrom-plate, he nebber should hab come into dis house," and Joseph waddled and shuffled off into his den,   E VER AGA IN.         .68i "Why! Helen, what is the matter?" exclaimed Mrs: Ledgeral, as Helen flew into the room and gave her mother a hearty embrace; " are you crazy? There, there, you have crumpled my collar out of all shape, and just see how you have mussed my cap-ribbons! What is the matter with you; are you crazy?" "Yes, almost, with joy. Oh, mamma dear, I am so happy!" "Happy! and a moment ago you were in the greatest dis- tress. Oh, Helen, Helen," exclaimed Mrs. Ledgeral, starting with a new fear, "you must calm yourself; you must lie down and compose yourself, and I will go and send for the doctor; and I'll get you an assafcetida pill, because you know if you should have-have-the hysterics, my dear.' "Oh, pshaw! my dear mamma, how can you say such a thing? I have the hysterics! I never felt less like it in my life; and if you send for Dr. Petcalf, he shan't come into this room. I'll go downstairs to see him in full dress, and I'll make him talk nothing but gossip. He shan't feel my pulse or look at my tongue, and he shan't even mention a tincture comp. of any kind; and if he does, I won't take a drop." Mrs. Ledgeral was fain to take her departure without car- rying out her threat about Dr. Petcalf or the assafcetida pill, but it was with mingled feelings of fear and wonder. There was a sense of something mysterious, something in connection with both husband and daughter which she could not compre- hend or explain. How many of these little domestic mysteries are all around us! Often we cannot penetrate them, and often we think we have opened them when we have only been fumbling with the wrong key. Perhaps Mrs. Ledgeral would have grasped the solution had she turned back after leaving the room and found Helen seated at her desk-the drawer of her secret treasures un- locked, and a manuscript lying before her, of which she was reading, with every mark of deep emotion, the concluding lines:   682         NEVER AGA IN. "Oh, Spirit of Night! Nor pride nor passion can withstand thy power; And now and ever, My hapless love, thy ebon hours shall measure To me as richest treasure." It was an old and somewhat worn sheet of note paper, dis. colored by age and dust, and evidently, of a foreign manufac. ture, that fell from the envelope in Mr. Ledgeral's hands, and in it a small slip of paper in the hlandwriting of the Count In this last there were but a few words, as follows: "It must be that the accompanying letter belongs by right to Mr. Ledgeral. After some inquiry, I have satisfied myself that, although the name of Courtlandt is, both as a Christian and surname, not uncommon in America, there is no one bear- ing the name but Mr. Courtlandt Ledgeral to whom this letter could have been addressed. If I am wrong, the letter can be returned to me. It was found among the papers of my father, the Count Albert von Isenthal. The writer of it, my aunt, died but a few years since in a convent near Pesth." "H. V. I." Count Albert von Isenthal! and the Countess Julia!- his aunt! Mr. Ledgeral uttered a deep sigh of relief, and un- folded the letter, which was without date or address : "Why do I write to thee, when I know I shall not have the courage-or shall I say the weakness-to send thee the letter? Why do I write to thee, oh Courtlandt,--whv doI turn to thee in this my hour of agony, when I know that thou canst do nothing for me? God knows. Perhaps it is because my heart is so sick of the grief that fills it that anything that brings up the memory of such passionate emotions as modu- lated its beats in those happy days at Baden is a relief; per- haps because it soothes me to thus stare my afflictions more fully in the face. I expect, I hope nothing from thee! Five years have passed-no man's love ever bridged such a gulf. I know thy history, although I have never heard thy name men- tioned. Thou hast ranged thyself-thou hast settled down- thou hast become a man of family-married some proper femme de menage possibly, and a reminder of that time of mad- ness would be an impertinence--would it not?   I        NE VER A GAIN.         683 "But perhaps I am mistaken. Thou still thinkest of me? Thou must-how canst thou help it? I first taught thee that thou hadst a heart ;-thou canst not blame me. I was an un- willing teacher, and I myself learned the lesson for the first time-yes, for the first and last time. Thou canst not then have forgotten me I Forgotten me t I were a fool to think so! 'Twould be a treason to love. 'Twould be to strip my pride of all excuses, and wrap myself in a mantle of disgrace and shame forever. I will not think so! "Know, thou, that I am desolate and alone-oh, how des- olate! First, my husband, Count Joseph von Isenthal. Thou wilt say that the blow was not severe, but then, my child, my beautiful boy,-oh, couldst thou have seen him! But God could not pardon the crime of which he would have been the agent;- He could not pardon the sins of his mother -He took him away and delivered me over to the tender mercies of my most bitter enemy. For the lost inheritance I care nothing. It was a weight-a horrible load-a reproach and a remorse while my child lived; and now that he is gone, the loss is less than nothing. Rank, state, fortune! I hate them. I am wrong--I despise them too much to hate them. My heart hats no room for hate. I only ask to forget them. I take myself away from this horrible place. Thank God for a retreat in my own country, where I can shut out the world for- ever i In time--if I live-tears and prayers may expiate my sin; now I have no tears. I cannot pray! alas, I cannot re- pent t God forgive me! But that, I feel, is a mere phrase. My only hope is that time will teach me to put meaning in the words. All that I can ask of Him now in sincerity is that He will bless you, and send me soon the only relief for heart-ache like mine. I know that it will not be long. I feel so sure of that, that I can venture to say what I would not otherwise say, and that is, that if ever thy wanderings should bring thee to Pesth, thou will find, by inquiries in the neighborhood of that city, my grave in the longed-for resting-place of        JULIA VON ISENTHAL.' Lost in thought, Mr. Ledgeral sat with this letter in his hand for more than an hour, occasionally re-reading it until every word was cut into his brain with the distinctness of an antique intaglio. And what a host of thoughts and feelings it evoked I Unlocking the most secret chambers of the mind, vivifying dead and buried memories, and lighting up images that had almost faded out in the dim distance-at one mo-   O04         V- VK 4 A GAI2N. ment it stared at him like a transcript from the great book, and the next floated before his eyes in a mist of tender, deli. cious, melancholy sentiment, the like of which, more thah any. thing else, makes us elderly fellows sensible of a very, very mysterious providence that so orders it that some things are so very wrong and yet so very nice. Joseph announced lunch. Mr. Ledgeral needed no lunch, but it was getting a little chilly; Joseph might send some one to light the fire. Soon the fire was blazing brightly, and still Mr. Ledgeral mused and mused.  At length he rose from the seat, and, after turning the key in the study door, unlocked the secret drawer of his desk and took out the reddish golden tress that we saw him looking at once before. He examined it carefully, caressingly.  He held it in his hand while he deliberately re-read the letter, and then advancing to the fire, flung both the tress and letter into the bright blaze. He watched till the last flash and sparkle had gone out. There was something propitiatory in the act. It was a sacrifice to marital right, to propriety, to respectabil- ity-to position as a man, as a great merchant, and as a ves- try man of St. Cyprian's.  Never again, no, never again, should that door of his heart be opened, even to his own con- sciousness.  That book was closed-a little balance against him perhaps; but what's the use of running over the figures again to find it. Call it all square. Ah, if an old sinner's accounts that he has settled so satisfactorily to himself never could be opened again, how charming it would be!   CHAPTER XXXVIII. Something beyond Whoppers' Comprehension-The Captain's Engage- ment announced-Madame Steignitz gives her Opinion of Helen. "WHAT the devil does this mean?" exclaimed Mr. Whoppers, as, the morning after he and Luther re- turned to town, he picked up and opened a note requesting the pleasure of his and Mr. Lansdale's company to dinner that very day. "Is the sky about to fall? Is the millen- nium dawning?" and Mr. Whoppers sat down and put his fin- ger to his head in an attitude of profound reflection. Luther took the note and read it. There it was, plain enough : "We shall all be happy to see your friend, Mr. Lans- dale. Be sure and insist upon his coming with you." There it was, quite an informal, short notice. A family dinner evi- dently, and quite emphatic phraseology. "Do you know, Luther, there are few things in this world that I don't know," said Mr. Whoppers, speaking in quite a melancholy tone. "I have studied law; I have attended medical -lectures, and at one time I thought of going into the ministry, and got myself up quite strong in divinity; I was once a clerk in a shipping-house, and once I took a stock of dry-goods out to Texas and got cleaned out of the whole in less than a year; I have worked on a farm, shoved a jack-plane for six months, and have set type with my own hands,-in a word, I'm editor of the Universe. What I don't know, I don't really estimate to be worth knowing, but hang me if I can make out the meaning of this thing. It surpasses my com- prehension." And well it might. It went quite beyond the comprehen- --------.. -^^^^Hr i.   686    .VNE'VER AGAIN. sion of a good many other people, Mrs. Struggles in particu- lar. "You don't tell me, dear Carrie, that Mr. Ledgeral really intends to have that young man up here to dinner!" she ex. claimed. Mrs. Ledgeral gave a slight affirmative toss of the chin, as much as to say that the matter had passed beyond further dis- cussion. "And you have encouraged the idea'?" persisted Mrs. Struggles. "No," curtly replied Mrs. Ledgeral; "but I have submit- ted to it." "Submitted! oh, my dear! and after all the fears you have had about him; and now this business of the Count has come to an end!" Mrs. Ledgeral took no notice of the remark. She was not in the habit of attending very closely to any observations from Mrs. Struggles, and in this case her mind was taken up with some points in the recent conversation she had had with her husband, in which, although she had by no means learned the complete truth, a few facts, with the proper glossing, with which a clever husband always knows how to suit them to the narrow capacity of his confiding wife, had been elicited. Mrs. Ledgeral had arisen from the discussion npot, perhaps, a much wiser, but a sadder woman. Not the slightest suspicion of any moral delinquency on his part; but that terrible mys- tery '" business." No woman can understand that, you know. She could just get a glimpse of the awful gulf upon the edge of which she had been unconsciously standing, but she had no disposition to investigate the danger, inasmuch as Mr. Ledg- eral assured her that; thanks to some happy arrangement with some unknown capitalists, involving the admission of Luther in some undefined manner to a partnership in the house, the danger had been passed, and that nothing was to be apprehended in future except, perhaps, for a year or two, the necessity of some slight retrenchment of expenditure. "What is society coming to?" thought Mrs. Struggles. "I must alter my manner to that young man. Who knows?   NEVE R AGAIN.         687 Helen is such a queer girl; stranger things than that have happened, and if they should, why they would be the hand- somest, and perhaps the most fashionable, young couple in the city. And, after all, they say that his father was once a very fashionable man, and that is something in these days, when society is getting to be so demoralized and so many common people -re pushing their way up ;" and Mrs. Struggles gave the usual toss of her head with which whenever her favorite term "shoddy" arose to her lips she threw off, as it were, all remembrance of the time when she had strolled the forlornest of forlorn nobodies up and down the piazza at Sharon. "I have a note for you," said Miss Jones, addressing Luther, after breakfast, and slyly pulling it out from some of the recesses of her dress, she tendered the letter with her plump hand, upon which Luther would have been very unobservant not to have noticed a very pretty diamond ring. Others had noticed it, too. Miss Billings said she believed that foolish old fellow had gone and spent his last cent for it. "Well, it don't mean anything," exclaimed Mrs. Waldie. "These sailors get engaged to everybody they can all over the world. He'll never marry her. He's not such a fool as to go and marry an old maid." "Old maid!" exclaimed Miss Billings. "Well, so she is. She's thirty-seven if she's a day; but I don't see why he shouldn't marry an old maid as well as to marry an old widow." "Don't you, my dear?" replied Mrs. - aldie, smiling grimly, but softening her voice to its sweetest tones; " don't you? Well, that is because, although gracious knows you have lived long enough, you never had any experience." "Experience!" retorted Miss Billings. "Experience in- deed! I hope not. There is such a thing as having too much experience-yes, Mrs. Waldie.  I hope it may never be my lot to hang out a sign in the matrimonial market-' Second- hand goods for sale--very cheap.' " "Miss Billings!" The tone was up an octave, at least. "Mrs. Waldie!" and a corresponding descent of the scale.   688        NE VER AGAINV.  The compression of feeling was awful. A passion safety valve would have indicated a hundred pounds pressure to the square inch at least. But there was no explosion. Mrs. Waldie opened the escape-pipe. "My dear Miss Billings, I really didn't mean anything." "Nor I either, my dear Mrs. Waldie." "It is all that abominable woman." "Yes, and that foolish old man." "You are right, and it would be absurd in us now wouldn't it, Clara dear?" "It would indeed, my dear Kitty, and I am quite ashamed to think of it. Come up to my room now. I want to show you a pattern from Stewart's--the sweetest thing for a Dolly Varden you ever did see. The clerk told me that Mrs. Strug- gles took a dress off it, and she, you know, is the very tip- top of fashion." Luther's letter was from the Captain, and contained only a few characteristic lines: "MY DEAR BOY: W"When a sailor has fairly passed the ' roaring forties 'on the voyage of life, and got down into the horse latitudes, say about forty-five, he may reasonably look out for fine weather and smooth sailing, and can all the better enjoy the pleasure and comfort of a nice trim consort to share with him the pleasures of the voyage.  Now, that is my case exactly. I have run over my  reckoning and made my  observations, and find latitude and  longitude all right. There are no shoals near, and I shall have plenty of sea-room. I have concluded, then, to take a pull on my weather braces and square away for the gulf of matrimony. I don't know much about the navigation. I hear that there are plenty of rocks and shoals, but I  have known several fellows who have tried a cruise in those waters, and their crafts have been so finely moulded, and nicely ballasted, and skilfully handled, that, although  compelled, in some cases, to push olt dead to windward, they have stood on to Felicity Point, when they eased off their sheets, caught the favorable domestic breezes, and have come back again loaded with happiness enough to last for life. "In my case, I  have, perhaps, like all mariners in strange seas, felt a little dubious. Like old Captain Snyddle, when the sea-serpent flopped his tail-that is, the serpent's tail-- Y-           .    NE VER AGAIN.         68 ;9 over the bulwarks, right into the oil kettles, I was dubious whether to try or not. But I have decided; and these few lines are to announce that Miss Jones has consented to the voyage matrimonial with me. If everything goes right we will be spliced upon my return, when I hope to receive your congratulations and those of Mr. Whoppers. "I am sorry not to have seen you before getting off; but the Spoondrift can't wait, and the sooner I go the sooner I shall return, not only to the girl I leave behind me, but to the young friend whom I love so dearly, and in whose love I shall hope ever to remain, your "Most obliged servant to command." Luther seized the plump hand of Miss Jones, and shook it heartily. "My dear Miss Jones, I don't know how to express my congratulations in language strong enough. You've got the best man in the world." "But men are such deceivers," simpered Miss Jones. "So they are," replied Luther, " and you'll find the Cap- tain one of them. He'll deceive you. You'll find him a thousand times better than he pretends or you can think. You ought to be a happy woman." "Oh, I am-too' happy!-too happy!-except when the wind blows; then I am so miserable." "Ha! sets the wind in that quarter?" puts in Mr. Whop- pers. "My dear Miss Jones, you should say ' Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! there is a. little cherub that sits up aloft that keeps watch over the life of poor Jack.' But I sup- pose you would prefer to sing, ' Breathe soft, ye winds; ye waves, in silence sleep.' - But, at any rate, you should comfort yourself when the wind blows fiercest, that perhaps it ' sits in the shoulder of his sail' and is bravely distending the courses and royals of eager love. Wait but a little, and the favoring winds will waft him to your feet; and then-then- you can wind him around your finger, and you'll never be so cruel as to let that wind wreck his fairest hopes." How long Mr. Whoppers would have run on with his non- sense there is no telling, but it was time for Luther to go round to Wooster Street for a visit to Madame Steignitz, and " ax ' v=Xwr s    690        NE VER AGA4 IN. he carried Mr. Whoppers off with him, but he himself was not destined to get rid of the editor so easily. "You must come up to my room; I want to read you something. You must know I sat up till three o'clock this morning--although I was tired to death with our railroad ride --writing the first chapter of my novel. Remember I told you that I think incongruity one of the first elements of a good story, and that it has never been properly worked. I can't get the fellows to do it, so I have. to do it myself. Mak- ing a Persian Emperor talk like a New York soap-fat man, or the ancient Queen of Palmyra act and think like a boarding- school miss, is all very well as far as it goes, but the incidents are so poor and commonplace-no invention, no style, no natural and easy development of an incomprehensible incon- gruity. Those kind of things do for journals with a large cir- culation in the country, and I don't say that they are not very fine and clever, but I do say that the incongruous is a mine that has not as yet been fully worked for city circulation. Come up, come up! I'll just read you the first chapter; it won't take two minutes." Luther pleaded his engagements. "I1 haven't time, and besides, I don't want to hear any of your nonsense." "Ah, Luther, I did not expect that of you; but hold on a moment. You won't? Well, good-bye; give my love to your old woman, and hark ye! ask her if she knows anything of this sudden shift of wind in Washington Square." Luther found his old friend anxiously expecting him. But what a change in her appearance! She seemed suddenly to have grown much older. Her vivacity of manner had all gone; she had grown thin, and the deadly pallor of her wan countenance was aggravated rather than relieved by the bril- liant sparkle of her deeply sunken eyes. Luther was shocked, and expressed his feelings. "Oh, my health is as it should be, after all those- cursed bandits did to me. But now I shall get better--now I see you once more." Luther reproved her for letting him go awav in the belief   NE VER A GAIN.        69  that she was getting quite strong, and for not sending him one word as to her health. "Oh, I would not that the old should be exigeant to the young," she replied; " and I knew that you needed the jour- ney. I knew that you had good cause to wish for some dis- traction. Ah! ah! you think I don't understand, but I know the distance between a young man of no fortune and a great merchant's daughter. People think that it is only in Europe that it is so, because there they are more honest and come right out, and say 'What have you got? and how much will you give? and my daughter is worth so much.' But here the barrier is not so plain in words, but just as strong-more strong to a young man of honor, because 'tis not alone the parents, but 'tis the miserable society that says, ' No, no, you have not got the money-you must have very much money. She can double her fortune with some rich man; you would not cheat her-what you call humbug her-with your love that isn't worth one dollar in the market.'" The old lady paused, leaned her arms upon the table, and looked sharply at Luther, who made no reply. ' You see I understand," she continued, " and I under- stand more than that. I have seen her." "Seen who?" demanded Luther. "Miss Helen Ledgeral!  Oh, you need say nothing. Did you thnk that I did not know-from the- day you put your foot in this house, three years ago, all that pass through your mind--you a garcon si doux, si brave, si bean, mais si-si--green, what you call innocent, and I a woman old be- fore my time and at your age already si rusee-et si instruite dans tous les mystgres du cxur. Ah, I should be an old fool if I could not read you like a book. Oh you need not blush or grow angry. I read you, but I read nothing but what is good; and oh, I have read so much in men's minds that is very bad! Yes, I have seen her, and I do not wonder at your despair. 'Twas all the same as turning your back on a glimpse of Heaven and walking off towards the other place, was it not? Well, well, I have seen her and I approve.              .   692        ANTEVER AGAIN. Yes, I approve. I know what many young girls are ; I know how stupid-how mesquzin what you call mean, all their no; tions are. 'Tis bad in Europe, but it's worse -here; because they have no training; they have some school education, but no training. They have the vivacity of youth-they can dance and dress, and take their share in the poor little badinage de societ, but still they are stupid. They live shut up in their little world of fashion. They think that the sun shines only to make their bouquets--that the good God is a kind of pastry cook, and that he works only to make bon-. bons for them. They think that the handsome little Johnny, or the elegant Billy, or the dancing Jacky, are the finest flowers of manhood. "But she is not one of them. No, no, I have seen her. I have inquired. No, she is not one of them. She is full of passion and feeling-she has education-she has ideas, she has simplicity and honesty-she will grow into a woman with a large soul, and a clear head, and a grand manner, and her set and society at large, and the world, may be, will be the better for her. Such a woman must not wreck her heart upon some poor sprig of fashion, who has no soul -beyond the horse-race, the billiard-table, the drive in the park, or the silly figures of the cotillion. What you think, eh?" Luther had listened in silent wonder to Madame's voluble flow of almost pure English, but as his fancy yielded to the picture her words conjured up, he dropped his head upon the table and fairly groaned aloud. - Come, come, my dear boy," exclaimed Mradame, running her little delicate hand through his brown IBcks. 'Come! come! you are not one of those foolish fellows that think there is nothing in the world but love--not one of those silly fellows that the women writers put so much into their novels. Oh, I read them a' good many times, when I am alone, and I say ' Bah! you foolish women, you do not know the men. You have not seen so much of them as I. You do not know that the man whose love is the biggest and the     NEVER AGAIN.          693 strongest has plenty of other things in his mind, besides his love.' No! you are not one of them! But courage. The sky shall brighten soon!" Luther roused himself, and, suddenly recollecting his din- ner invitation, put the inquiry that Mr. Whoppers had sug- gested. But the old woman turned his question by a series of rapid and voluble inquiries in her turn. "Well, well, I know nothing-I can say nothing; but did I not say that the sky shall brighten soon? Nous verrons, nous verrons l And Luther was compelled to content himself with her "nous verrons" and a profusion of significant words and winks. "I really believe Whoppers is right," muttered Luther, as he took his departure. "She does know something about it -perhaps all about it. She is a real old witch, or, better, a fairy ;" and Luther's thoughts wandered away to the many wonderful things done by fairies, as recorded in the authentic pages of poetry and prose fiction. Need it be said that his spirits rose, and rose, until he hardly knew which way to turn? Decidedly he would not go down to resume his stupid duties that day. He would--yes, he would make a little excursion across the river, and have a quiet talk with his old friend, Mr. Planly, and see how all the inventions were coming on.   CHAPTER XXXIX. Luther visits Mr. Planly--Inventions of all kinds-The laws of Mala- ria--The Casa Planly---A grand plan of Englishizing Africa-A fam- ily Dinner-Party. "A  PENNY for your thoughts!" exclaimed Luther, as he quietly raised the latch of Mr. Planly's door, and stepped into the room without disturbing the old inventor, who, profoundly buried in thought, had not heeded the young man's preliminary tap. "A penny for your thoughts." At the sound of the pleasant voice Mr. Planly started up from his chair so suddenly that his arm swept from the table several tools, drawings, and pieces of modelled wood. Grasp- ing Luther's extended hand, he greeted him with a degree of warmth that left no doubt of a cordial appreciation of the visit. ' A penny for your thoughts." "My dear boy, you would be cheated at that price. They are not worth the money." "They seemed to be far enough away, at any rate," said Luther. "Yes, a thousand years ahead, at least. I was just indulg- ing imagination with an excursion into the future- pleasurable but profitless--a kind of mental intoxication which I have been in the habit of indulging all my life-a kind of intel- lectual dissipation more wasteful of mind and soul power than downright hard drinking. Take warning, take warning, my young friend, and don't become a dreamer. Seize the pass- ing moment. Live in the present, and don't take up a per-   NE/VER AGAIN.         695 manent residence in the future as I have done, however at- tractive its glories may be." "Well, to come down to the present," replied Luther, laughing; " how comes on the object-glass that I left you at work on?" "Put aside, as usual, for the present." "Tired of it?-or wouldn't the plan work?" "No, the usual difficulty. I found that I should require some platinum bands to strengthen my revolving crucible, and platinum costs. money; and so I'll just wait until Van- derbilt, or Stewart, or some other Croesus, thinks proper to do something for science-something for the increase of knowledge, rather than for its diffusion." "Well, you won't have to wait long," and Luther went on to give the astonished inventor an account of Mr. Stichen; of his death, and the proviso in his will for the construction of a telescope of at least two hundred and fifty feet focal length, and with an objective of corresponding aperture, and made of glass, prepared by Mr. Planly himself. A faint glow suffused for a moment the inventor's cheeks, but it rapidly passed. He leaned his head upon his hand, and mused for some moments in silence. C You don't seem to receive the news as enthusiastically as I expected," remarked Luther. "Shall I tell you why?" replied Mr. Planly. "I have, by close observation of myself, made a psycholog- ical discovery. There is a marked tendency in all minds- to periodicity in intellectual movements, but this tendency is so obscured, or thwarted by the will, or by enforced habits, that in most cases it is not easily felt or perceived. People only know that they get tired of certain trains of thought or certain ideas after a while; but they compel the mind to go on with them, or to take them up after short intervals of rest. Now, as I have no will, my mind wanders without control, and this law of periodicity shows itself in full force. I am satis- fied that there is a tendency to think by monthly fits, and that left to itself, the mind will pursue a single idea or a single   696        NEVE R A GAIN. train of thought for only that length of time, and that it will recur to it again only after a similar interval. Now my mind took up an old and favorite subject--the telescope, and for a month it had nothing in it but an improved objective, but it has gone now. It will come again, and perhaps, again and again, long before anything can be done under the will of Mr. Stichen." "And may I ask," demanded Luther, " what your mind turned to after it had got through with its monthly telescope fit? Any of these things?" and Luther pointed to several models apparently of shells for a rifled cannon. "Yes, just those. You know what a fuss they are making over the torpedo system of defence-not only here, but al over the world. Well, it's all a big humbug; in fact, in view of these things, the biggest humbug going. This is what I call my torpedo exterminator. You see here is a shell: when filled with powder, or dynamite, this hole will be stopped up with a tightly-fitting screw plug, and here in the head, in lieu of a fuse hole, is a cavity into which fits, as you see, this little piece of simple and strong mechanism; the whole kept firm and motionless by this steel plug. The operation of the thing is this: You charge a gun with this shell, and fire it; the powerful impact of the exploding charge draws back this steel plug; the little fly-wheel is now liberated and set in motion by this spring; the shell goes .on its way, strikes the water, and sinks to the bottom. After an interval of one, two or five minutes, governed by the motions of the fly-wheel and the fineness of the thread of this screw, this little bolt is liberated, and, striking this cap, fires the shell and explodes all the torpedoes in its neighborhood, or breaks up the wires connecting them  with the torpedo batteries. Well, now, im- agine a fleet of English iron-clads coming up our harbor. 'There are no forts or land-batteries that could stop them five minutes. What we have are not, and probably never will be, fully armed; and even if they were, the guns would be good for nothing.  With our great fifteen and twenty-inch smooth bores it would be a case of great cry and little wool, as the   NIVE R AGA IV.        697 devil said when he sheared the pig. Oh, but the torpedoes! l'here is salvation for you! and I suppose we should have time to strew the channel with them. But on come the iron- clads under a cloud of- torpedo exterminators that would not leave a foot of mud in the channel undisturbed, or a gallon of water that would not have been thrown in the air-not a torpedo unexploded or an electric wire intact. The same sys- telm can be applied by boats at night, and the exterminator laid down quietly, and its mechanism so arranged that the ex- plosion shall take place only after an interval of one, two or three -hours, or more."' "But don't you think,' demanded Luther, " that the shock of the discharge upon your exterminators would damage the mechanism upon which its explosion depends?" Mr. Planly rubbed his hands together softly, and a gentle smile of satisfied and triumphant inventiveness stole over his countenance as he replied: "Your objection is well taken, but it is a mere question of mechanical detail, and I have guarded against any danger of that kind, but'"--and Mr. Planly nodded his head in a confidential 'way,--' I have another plan to which no such objection can be made. You see this little globule of glass? well, it contains a certain fluid. And vou see this little ball? it is made of certain chemnicals-I won't say, what. Well, I put this glass globule and this ball into this tube perforated with holes, and screw it into the head of the exterminator. When fired from the gun the impact of the powder breaks the glass--the fluid strikes the ball, and in five minutes or more the cheinical action that takes place sends a flame through these perforations and fires the con- tents of the shell. Suppose fifty or five hundred of these ex- terminators exploding, many of thelm simultaneously, at the bottom of our channel, how much of our torpedo system would be left at the end of a few hors?"? "But war never comes without due notice, and of course we should have time to prepare ourselves," remonstrated Lu- ther. "' Have time! but would we avail ourselves of it? Not at   698        NE VFE  A GCAIN. all. Official routine and stolidity would stand in the way, and we might wake up some day and find our miserable torpedc system -blown up about our ears, and a fleet of iron-clads in the East and North Rivers demanding, as a penalty of ignor- ance and conceit, a contribution of every dollar that could be raised in the city. The picture in all its horrors, of New York under the guns of an enemy, rose up in Luther's active imagination. TIe heard and saw the roar of cannon, ihe bursting of shells, the crackling of flamning houses; the fright and fury, the conster- nation and despair Vf the maddened people, the excitement in the " street," the undignified hurry-skurry of corpulent bankers and bank presidents, and the mad rushing and roar- ing of horrified " bulls," with one-only one--dignlified point in the picture, but that, rivalling in interest the renowned calmness and confidence of those brave old senators who, when the leaguer pressed hardest on the gates of Romef-toolly bought and sold Tiber river lots beyond the walls-tlat point was a party of steady old " bears," with Uncle Daniel at tleir head, sternly covering their shorts. He turned emphatically to Mr. Planly. "Why don't you show your exterminator at once to the government at Wash- ington?" he demanded. "Bah! What would be the use? I did make one effort. During the Nwar I wrote offering to attempt clearing the har- bor of Charleston, and for reply got a well-turned compliment about myj genius, etc.-that was all. No, I don't want to have anything to do with governments. I had enough of that kind of work in Italy, with my plan for eradicating mala- ria, or counteracting its influence." "And what was that plan?" demanded Luther. The question was an incautious one. In an instant Mr. Planly started from his attitude of languid indifference, brushed back his hair from his forehead with his hand, as if brushing back the cobwebs from his brain, rolled his eyes-gleaming with a sudden light-as if taking a comprehensive view of " creation, and opened his mouth at the proper angle" frrlrf torrent of talk.   NAE' I'Ei' A GA IAN.      699 "Mind you," he exclaimed, "I have nothing to do with the origin and constitution of malaria. I have my opinion on this point, and a pretty strong one after twenty-five years' ex- periment and observation." "At any rate," said Luther, " you think that whatever it is, it is the result of vegetable decomposition in moist places." "I think nothing of the kind. There are objections to this old and nearly exploded theory that are insuperable. The low temperature at which disease is frequently caused; the unaccountable productions of disease when there is no de- caying vegetation, and no inarsh .or even moisture, as in many places in Peru, or the wood tracts of Nepaul or Malwa, or in the dryest and most barren parts of the Maremma; the ex- emption -of certain places where occur all the supposed ele- ments, as in New South Wales, the Polynesian Islands; the inexplicable effects of cultivation in eradicating disease, and the unexplained vicissitudes of health in the same places in different, though similar, years, all forbid us to longer entertain the old theory of vegetable decomposition. Ovo- lan, one of the Fejee Islands is as volcanic as Sardinia, and as hot as the Maremma, and yet fevers are unknown there; Menouf, is as dirty and moist a city as there is in Egypt, and yet remarkably health!y; Singapore, surrounded by jungles, is yet a sanatarium for oriental invalids. "But," continued Mr. Planly, "' all this has nothing to do with my plan. I care not in what it consists, or what the cause. I propose only to take advantage of some of the laws governing its action, and the first great law is that it is opera- tive only. at night." "'That corresponds, I believe, to popular opinion," said Luther. "And scientific opinion, too. Mitchell says malarious diseases are not producible by exposure in sickly places dur- ing the daytime; darkness appears to be essential. Lancisi, fronm extensive observations in Italy, confirms the same idea. The records of the British and American navies are full F: proof that men visiting unhealthy shores in the daytime *    b          Noo NVER Aw GA IN. only will not take disease, but that sleeping one single night ashore is almost certain death. I will not keep you with these cases, but just listen to one single instance that I know of myself. Doctor 'lyrrel, of Georgia, had some swamp- land which he wished to reclaim. A large gcang of negro slaves were stationed upon the ground, but most of themn were at once taken sick, and many of them died. The attempt wasl repeated several times with the same result, until Dr. Tyrrel adopted the plan of removing the slaves a distance of three miles at sundown, and sending them to their work after sun- rise in the morning. Not a slave was taken sick after this. They could work in the swamp during the day with impunity, although it was so deadly at night that the acclimated negro could not escape the contagion. "I could produce a thousand proofs," continued Mr. Planly, " of the rigid universality of this law, as well as of another fact, and that is, that whatever malaria may be, it is easily strained from the atmosphere, and is incapable of rising above a very moderate height, say forty or fifty feet. There is not an intelligent physician in Italy who cannot produce facts enough from his own observation to prove that malaria is confined to a low and thin stratum of the atmos- phere. A hedge, a low fence, frequently shuts it out. It is safe to sleep on the top of a tower in the worst places in the Maremma. Sailors in the tops of ships' are safe, while those below are attacked. The writers on malaria all agree on this point with each other, and with popular opinion, which makes the highest apartment in an exposed house the healthiest. That it can be strained from the atmosphere, there is over- whelming proof. Popular sentiment and custom proves it. McCulloch says that by surrounding the head with a gauze veil, or canopium, the action of malaria is prevented, and that it is possible to sleep in the most pernicious parts of Italy without hazard of fever. "Many of the Spanish peasants, when at work in the morn- ing or the evening, in the rice-fields, in the neighborhood of Valencia, wear a helmet or head-piece covered with gauze, which completely shields the nose and mouth. y,   ANrEVER AGAIN.        701 "In -some localities in the Western United States it is a common custom to fill in the windows on the sides of the house exposed to the air of the swamps wlith gauze screens. Experience proves this practice to be a most effectual preventive. s A gentleman, who had a large and unhealthy plantation at the South, told me that he had adopted the plan of filling the windows of his house with gauze screens, and that he had thus been able to spend the most unhealthy seasons in safety. "The efficacy of screens of wood and shrubbery has been long known. We learn from Theophrastus that the plain of Latium was covered, especially toward the sea, by forests of laurel and myrtle, that served to protect the country from the pernicious southern winds, and to check the propagation of malaria. r' Two young medical officers left their ship, for a short ex- cursion of two or three days on Princes Island in the Gulf of Guinea. The famous Dr. Kane was one of them. One took the precaution of muffling his head at night in a thick veil, and escaped all disease. The other could not endure the discomfort of the veil, and contracted a violent fever. I wish you had a little time, .and I would give you a thousand cases that I have accumulated, but we will hurry to the question which I know has occurred to you, whether advantage may not be taken of these laws to prevent the injurious effects of malaria, and enable the most deadly soils to be cultivated in safety; and thus, in time, over large districts of country, to eradicate the evil, and destroy the destroyer!" "And you really think that that can be done?" de- manded Luther. "Easily. You have only to build malaria-proof houses- something like this," replied Mr. Planly, running to his desk and pulling out an architectural drawing; "an air-tight house that will accommodate a large body of laborers, with their wives and children,-a kind of enclosed village, with all the appurtenances and appliances of village life,-and supplied -   702        iVy V/ A'] A GAIN. with air from a lofty tower, furnished at the top with ven. tilating windows filled in with some kind of gauze. Oh, I have calculated all the details; the cost either of iron or of stone or wood lined with tin plates, the amount of ventilation required, the amount of steam or animal power to give the required ventilation, and every little question of form, size and internal arrangement. Well, I went out to Italy in hopes of getting a concession of malarious land large enough to war- rant the formation of a company, and the trial of the experi- ment on a large scale. The plan was received with universal approbation. It was discussed in the scientific journals and reported upon by scientific men, and received the favorable notice of members of the government.  You would have thought, as I did, that the thing was in a fair way to be tried. Lord bless you! you know not, and I hope you never may know, anything of the mysteries of Italian red tape. Talk of the military burdens of Italy! It is the civil service that is eating the heart out of that great and glorious country; it is the vast army of under-paid, hungry barnacles that are the great drag upon the ship of State. Reform the civil service- dismiss at once a hundred thousand lounging and lazy offi- cials who think that they have a vested right in their useless offices, and you'd see Italy come up like a giant unchained! The people are all right-one of the finest races; and I will say this for them--one of the most industrious on the globe, if they only had fair-playr." "In thinking of' malaria," interposed Luther, "it is very natural to turn to Italy; but I should think that the English could best try such an experiment." "In India?" said Mr. Planly. "Well, yes; but more particularly in Africa. Think of a line of your casa Planlys extending directly into the heart of the country,--easily defensible against any native force,-af- fording protection at night against the climate, and carrying English trade and English civilization into the centre of all active trading population."' Luther did think of it, and his imagination at once lighted   AT/E V I  A GAIN,       703 up long lines of malaria-proof trading-houses running up the rivers, or extending directly through swamp and jungle back from the shore, and carrying swarms of ruddy-faced Englishmen with uncongested livers into the great marts of Killoam and Saccatoo. He grew so excited, so interested, that he would have stayed all day talling over the scheme with its inventor had not the thought of his dinner invitation come into his, mind. He must hurry home and dress for the great occasion; but it was only at the last moment that he tore himself away from Mr. Planly's fascinating plans and calcu- lations.                          Punctual to the hour of six, Luther and Mr. Whoppers as- cended the steps of the Ledgeral mansion and rang the bell. The latter silent, alhnost speechless, and evidently weighed down in spirit by a consciousness of ignorance-a feeling that there might be perhaps several things in the world that even he-the editor of the Unizvi'rse-could not comprehend. Promptly old Joseph threw open the door. "What does this mean?" demanded Mr. Whoppers in a confidential whisper. "Don't know, sar; 'spec someting is' gwine to happen. Can't say, sar, but I kinder hope dat Billy Dugan is going to get his nose put out of jint. Call me old woolly head, eh?" Mrs. Ledgeral received her guests with an abstracted air, but still politely; in fact, cordially. "I need not present you Mr. Lansdale; you know Mr. and Mrs. Shippen already, and Mrs. Struggles and Mr. Gainsby and Mr. BIoggs. I am sorry that my daughter Laura is compelled to keep her room this evening, but my daughter Helen will be down in a moment." Luther had hardly finished his salutations,-especially as Mrs. Struggles hung on to his hand with the most affectionate interest,--when Mr. Ledgeral entered the room. Barely nod- ding to Mr. Whoppers, he extended his hand to Luther with a bland impressiveness that seldom characterized his manner, except when shaking the hand of a bank president during the time of a tighlt money-market. "We shall have half an hour before dinner is ready," lhe o   704        NVA V'ER A4 GAI IN said, 1 and I wish a little conversation with you. Will you walk into the library." As the door closed upon them, Luther recalled his first visit to that room. Hardly three short years, yet what a change in external circumstances, and what a still greater change in himself! He could not help feeling a little excited, but with a manner perfectly cool and collected, he seated himself, prepared to hear with equanimity anything the great man could say, even if it should be that, through Uncle Ship- pen's recommendation, his salary had been doubled. In concise terms Mr. Ledgeral explained how he had found the cares of business pressing upon him so heavily that he had resolved to take a partner; that he wanted a young man, active, energetic and industrious-one in whom he could have full confidence; that although he (Luther) was so very young, a great many people might think that he (Mr. Ledg- eraD was taking a very imprudent step, yet that nevertheless he was so firmly assured of his (Luther's) ability and general fitness, that, inasmuch as the question of capital had been fully arranged, he (Mr. LedgeraD had selected him above all others for the position. Here was a communication unexpected, overwhelming, enough to daze any young man with a proper sense of the awful elevation of an old-established, wealthy mercantile firm. Luther sat speechless for some minutes while the murmur of Whoppers' silver sea and the reverberations of Whoppers' golden gulf-one or both, once so mournful and dishearten- ing-stole upon his senses as sweetest music. But-but- once on the other side, would he find the angel with spangled wings and diamond slippers? If not, why he felt that he could hardly say " thank you " for the ferriage. "You say, sir," he replied, "that the question of capital has been arranged. I dor't see how that can be." "Your friend, Madame Steignitz, has advanced the money." "Impossible!" exclaimed Luther, starting from his chair. "Nothing impossible about it; it has already been paid.'   NE VER A GA IN.        y05 ' As a loan to me??" "That is as you may settle between you, but I rather think as a gift." "One other question, sir, if you please. What has become of Count Isenthal?" "He has left the city. There was a time," continued Mr. Ledgeral after a pause, "when we thought that he and my daughter Helen might make a match. Perhaps you heard the rumor. But that has all passed, and he will sail in a few days from California on a trip around the world." At this instant old Joseph knocked at the door, and announced that dinner was served. -Mr. Ledgeral led Luther across the hall to the drawing- room. " My friends," he exclaimed, '" allow me to present to you the new partner in the house of Ledgeral, Shippen & Co. Dinner is waiting, and we have no time for congratulations," he continued, cutting short Mrs. Struggles, who was rushing up to shake hands. "Mr. Lansdale, be so good as to give your arm to Mrs. Ledgeral, and she will show you the way to the dining-room." Whoppers was all in a maze, but he did not lose his pres- ence of mind. He dexterously whipped around Mrs. Strug- gles,- leaving her to Mr. Gainsby, and offered his arm to Aunt Shippen, while Mr. Ledgeral, with Uncle Shippen and Mr. Boggs and Helen, brought up the rear. A general tension of feeling is often unfavorable to con- versational brilliancy. Even Mr. Whoppers, accustomed as he was to taking the lead in clearing away any obstructions to the tide of talk, was wanting in his usual vivacity, and sat almost silent until the dessert, when he roused himself and let slip a couple of puns, and even proposed to Mr. Ledgeral a conundrum, which there is no use in giving here, as it has since gone the rounds of the press. The dinner would, indeed, have been a doleful one, had not Uncle Shippen got upon the physical regeneration of the human race, and Mrs. Struggles upon the demoralization of New York society--" so much shoddy, you know.," 45   700        NE' VER AGAIN. And then came up the subject of early marriages and long engagements, upon iuwhich Aunt Shippen was full authorityr. She did not approve of long engagenlents, but, on the other ha,.d, she did not approve of the very early marriages so comll- mon among our young people. "Not a day before a girl is twenty-one, and the gentleman from two to ten years older. Younger than that is mere fool- ishness-they know nothing of life, they can't know their own minds." "Yes," interposed Uncle Shippen, "'and I don't think these very early marriages can contribute towards the physi- cal regeneration of the human race." "The 'Cardinal's tears,' sar," whispered Joseph, as he filled Luther's glass, and then Mr. Ledgeral had to tell for the five hundredth time the singular circumstances by which that very old Madeira had come into his father's possession. The ladies retired, and the gentlemen soon followed, after sitting just long enough to drink long life and success to the new partner in the firm. Luther made his way into the drawing-room; but why should he linger there with the old ladies-however polite and condescending they might be? Helen was in the front parlor, --he could see her through. the open folding-door turning over some books at the music-stand. A little internal tremor, but he was resolute, and slipped away from Mrs: Struggles' clutches just as she was in the midst of the latest fashionable news-- the how and the why of the rupture between Sophie Slangton and old Joe Bilkers,-leaving her to expend her information upon Mr. Boggs, who had heard it all ten days before, at the club.   .         X "' I haven't had a chance to speak to you, Miss Helen, all this time." What a  fib! when Helen knew that he had been talking to her with his eyes all the time at dinner. "How could you?" she replied. "You know you are the great man of the occasion, and the seat of honor is next to mnamma. You seemed to have a   good deal of conversation with her."   NVE rER A (A7IN.       7 7. Cc Your mamma was very pleasant and agreeable, but-I don't understand it at all." "Nor I either," said Helen. '"I don't comprehend it at all -it seems like a dream; but you must know more about it than I do." "Well, let us sit down here,' replied Luther, instinctively choosing a sofa quite hidden from view of all in the back room, " and I will tell you all I know, and--and--Helen, you will let me tell you a little of something what I feel, won't 7you?" And Luther did tell her all that he knew, and was going on to tell her a good deal that he felt and hoped, and to assist his explanations had secured her little hand in one of his, while his other was resting along the back of the sofa, in very great danger of dropping every moment to her waist, when Uncle Shippen, with an enormous pair of open callipers in his hand, bustled in. "Where is he? Oh, here you are. I just want to take that measure over again-from the sulcus at the root of the nose to the orifice of the ear, combined with the width through the centre of the parietals-tremendous! Look here, Mrs. Struggles, look here, Sis ; tremendous! never saw the prin- ciple of longevitjy so strongly indicated." And there was an end of love-making for that evening; the callipers did thel business.  Let us hope, for poor Luther's sake, that op'prriities, and many of them, may occur again when no such formidable steel instruments may stand in the way. Luther and Mr. Whoppers took their departure together. As the door closed behind them, Mr. Whoppers suddenly wheeled in front of Luther and put both hands on his breast. "Tell me," he exclaimed, 'u what all this means!" "I hardly know myself," replied Luther; " it is all like a dream-perhaps it is a dream; but I believe I am to be a partner in the firm." But how, and why? ' ' Why you see my old mere has gone and done it. 'She has-advanced for me the necessary capital."   708        NEYVER AGAIN. "Capital! I might have known it. Fool that I was to doubt for an instant. Capital! that one word has done more for me than all the 'Cardinal's tears." Luther, you have restored me to myself," and Mr. Whoppers seized his com- panion's hand and wrung it heartily. "Do you know," he continued, " that I was fool enough to think for a moment that old Ledgeral had discerned your merit, and that purely out of consideration for you and his daughter, he had resolved to give you a shared of his business and receive vou as his son-in-law!-and I allowed myself to be overwhelmed by the idea that there were depths of mag- nanimity and generosity and disinterestedness which I could never fathom. But I am all right now. That one word, 'Capital paid in,' restores my confidence in my knowledge of human-nature-restores to me the pleasant and profound con- nection of the general-I won't say universal, because that, Luther, would be personal-of the general selfishness, the littleness, the meanness of humanity. Never again, no, never again will I humbug myself in that style!"  "Never again, you precious old soft-hearted humbug!" exclaimed Luther. "Never again, no, never again," murmured Mr. Whoppers, and the 'Cardinal's tears' trembled in his voice. G  ,   CHAPTER XL. TERMNAL. HE reader will perhaps be disappointed at finding that the marriage which he or she had such a good right to expect has not taken place yet, although it is now two years since the date of the little dinner-party mentioned in the last chapter. The fact is, Uncle Shippen set his foot down strong against it, and Aunt Shippen coincided with him. The young, people were too young; they must wait full two years. Not a tedious time for Luther and Helen, however. They have contrived to fill up the interval quite to their own satisfaction, and we have the authority of the poet for the fact that Time's footsteps fall very lightly under some cir cumstances. But the season of probation is evidently drawing to a close Mrs. Struggles had for some time been giving little confiden tial nods and winks, and has even been heard to mutter quite positively something about " early in the' spring." It woul never do for us to be more communicative than Mrs. Strug gles. As an atonement, however, for our reticence, we thinl we can promise our few unfashionable readers invitations t the church; to the'reception would be perhaps beyond ou influence. The fashionable reader will of course go to th house and be ushered into the very presence of the bride b half-a-dozen fellows chanting epithalamiums with wreaths o marjoram around their heads and lacs d'amour of white rit lons in their button-holes.   710        XE VEER A GAIN. But if compelled to disappoint the reader in relation to a marriage so easily-and, let us hope, so earnestly--antici- pated, we more than make up by announcing a marriage which no one could have dreamed of. The news comes to us in 'the shape of a notice in Galignani. "MARRIED--At the American Embassy, on the loth inst., by the Rev. Mr. HONEYALL, Mr. HAMLTON L. BOGGS to 'Mrs. ELIZABETH 13. STICHEN, widow of the late-lamented JOHIN ST1ICHEN; all of New York." The happy couple have taken passage in the steamer of the 2oth inst., very much to the delight of Mrs. Struggles, as they will arrive just in time for her grand "Gabble-Gobble" on the I3th proximo. Another marriage we may mention, although it is rather an old affair-that of the Captain and Miss Jones. It is more than a year! since it took place-time enough for the happy couple to make a trip out to Sydney, New South Wales, thence to Hong Kong and San Francisco, and so, around Cape Horn, home.  They are now in New York, and, as boarders with the new landlady, Mrs. Smith, they occupy with their infant and nurse the identical second floor front that Mrs. Combings once prided herself upon as the chief attrac- tion of her home. Whether the Captain will ever go to sea again is doubtful. As he says himself, he is going to take a pull on his clew-lines, and may even go so far as to furl and pass gaskets, but that he don't think he will unbend sails and send down spars yet awhile. However, from the way he looks sometimes at that baby, it wouldn't be wonderful if he should decide to strip to a girt-line and go into ordinary for the rest of his life. Dr. Droney has received a call, and has undertaken the duty of building up a  church among the Pottowatomies. Let us hope that he may be successful. He is a very worthy man, and not at all to blame for a systen, or state of society, that allows-in fact encourages-a  slow, dull man to slip nto a  calling that requires the highest intellect, the most catholic spirit and the profoundest and most advanced learn- ing, and then starves im afterwards!   NE VE R AGA INV.  Mrs. Lasher, however, is a fixture of the house in Bleeck- er Street, and she holds forth as learnedly as ever ;--the last grand discovery in medicine is the theme. Listen, dear reader, for a moment. The subject may not be interesting, but you will perhaps get some useful information, and we can- not bear to let a foolish novel go into the world without car- rying on its pages at least some one little fact or reflection, useful for mental edification or spiritual improvement. The Captain is listening good-naturedly, while Mrs. Lasher S expounds the new system of electro-biosopathy, apropos of some trouble in the nursery upstairs. "You say, Captain, that you doctor your sailors yourself, and that whenever any one is sick you give him a big dose of calomel and jalop. Now I warn you, that if you give that baby a big dose of calomnel and jalop, you will be sorry for it. Let me urge you to try the electro-biosopathic system of treatment. It is'better than allopathy-it is better even than homceopathy. It requires no medicine at all, and the cures are wonderful. The theory of it is so reasonable, and the practice of it so simple, that it is astonishing it has not been introduced sooner. It is just the application of humanized magnets to the diseased organ. It is the latest discovery of the great Dr. Quackenhammer. You see he found by wind- ing the human body with many turns of covered copper wire, and then sending the galvanic fluid from a powerful battery through this wire, that the body is rendered strongly magnetic. It at once occurred to him that, by means of a series of human magnets, the magnetic influence might be converted into vitali- cal force, and applied to the cure of disease. He arranges his human magnets in pairs-male and female, always selecting, of course, strong, healthy persons. They join hands-a female and a male, alternately--to the number of five, six, or more pairs. The. patient is placed between the two ends of this vitalical chain. The polar couple now clasp or press their free hands upon either side of the diseased por- tion of the patient's body and the circuit is complete. The galvanic influence is sent through the wire-each member of   71 2        'NEVER A GA IN. the chain is converted into a magnet: this human magnetism at once begins to run through the diseased portion or organ, and is instantly, as it stands to reason, converted into-vitalic-al force: any one can see at once that it must operate in this way. It works like a charm-nothing can resist the influence of this vis visee. The most stubborn diseases yield almost instantly to this current of vitalical force, which can be in- creased to any extent by increasing the number of magnets. Why there was one old fellow who had had an enlarged and congested liver for forty years. The doctor went up to seven couple with no effect. ' I'll fetch that liver down,' said the doctor, 'if it takes fourteen couple,' and it did. It took four- teen couple; but that liver collapsed after three sittings to a highly healthy and normal condition." Mrs. Lasher cited a great many wonderful cases. We don't vouch for them, but we must say that if one-half of them only are true, electro-biosopathy is indeed the greatest boon of latter-day science to humanity, and is evidently destined to have a great run. "And what has become of Mr. Whoppers?" asks, perhaps, some benighted reader. Gracious me, what a question! Don't everybody know how the Universe has increased in cir- culation, and how its editor has engaged all the talent in the country for its columns, and how it has come out in new type, and how it has been recently enlarged to double its primitive size? If any fellow don't know this he must be a hopeless case--quite beyond the reach of the double-leaded, reiterative advertisement; and not only ignorant, but a bad fellow, to boot-one who doesn't read regularly his daily Galvanizer, as. he ought to. Madame Steignitz still dwells in her little attic; no persua- sion can induce her to change. Helen visits her frequently, and upon one occasion urged that she should take a more comfortable, if not a more elegant, apartment. "No, no, my dear young lady," replied Madame Steignitz, "I know -what you think, and it is very good in you to think so, but it can not be. I am a poor old woman. This place is good enough   iVNE VER A GAI.        713 for me, and besides, it will not be long before I shall be lodged just as well any queen." The old lady is evidently failing fast. We are very sorry, and hope the reader is, too, especially as there will be no great consolation irLreading her-will, inasmuch as it is well understood that, after a few trifling legacies to benevolent institutions, she leaves Luther universal legatee; and the public can never know exactly how rich she was. What a pity! Nothing, it is universally admitted, can be more sooth- ing to the mind of the sorrowing general mourner over the grave of a millionnaire than to be informed by the newspapers exactly " how fat he cuts up," and it is well known that there are half-a-dozen cases that are daily watched for with extra- ordinary interest. What a pity, then, that such a legiti- mate curiosity, very. much intensified in the case of a very rich woman, should be baulked by the indefinite terms of a bequest in the lump! There is not much to add, unless it may be something which we ought not to add, as it is a profound diplomatic secret. But after all, there is perhaps no harm in mentioning it, as the English government have succeeded in completing their arrangement with the Dutch government, by which the Dutch, in return for some concessions on the southern shore of the west Afiican coast, have ceded to the English all their possessions on the northern coast and the Gulf of Guinea. "Now what does this mean?" more than one reader has already asked, and no newspaper-not even the Hrerald-has been able to give a satisfactory reply. But if the reader could see Luther's correspondence with the English government since he has so energetically taken up Mr. Planly's project of a' series of anti-malarial caravansaries, trading-hlouses or forts up and down the Niger, and extending in lines back into the interior of a country the richest in natural productions of any in the world, he would not long be in doubt,-he would see that it simply means that the English government, seeing the practicability and vast importance of the plan, wants the exclu- sive control of a long extent of coast before commencing oper-   71 4        AE .rVEiR A GAIN. ations for carrying a steady strieam of trade and tracts-of the comforts of civilization and the consolations of religion-'- directly into the heart of a benighted continent. Let us, as people of the same blood and langurage and literature, hope that our English cousins may succeed in this great undertaking. No mean jealousies now! Let all miser- able prejudices and antipathies-if there are any- sink out of sight, and the petty feelings of a narrow nationality be buried beneath the pride of race. But, even as Americans, we are deeply interested in the success of our cousins. It cannot but inure to our benefit in various ways, but especially in this-we have achieved politi- cal equality for the negro, but we have not as yet obtained for him social equality. Who knows, though, what may be done for him here when the court circles of Timbuctoo and Sac- catoo are once opened up to our leaders of fashion, and inti- mate relations are established between the ultimates of Bos- ton, New York and Philadelphia, and the ultimates of the imperial cities of Dahomey, Bambarra ,and Dafour? If this time ever arrives, great credit will unquestionably be due to Luther. Mr. Planly is so unenergetic and so apa- thetic that he never could have done anything alone. Luther, almost unaided, except by the advice and sympathy of Uncle Shippen, has so far, despite the pressure of business in Bur- ling Slip, succeeded in pushing the thing on. At one time he had hopes of interesting Mr. Ledgeral, but that gentleman had made, up his mind never again to have anything to do with any scheme, plan, speculation or business of any kind outside. the affairs of the firm. He listened, shook his head, and, in a subdued but decisive tone, murmured, "NEVER AGAIN!" THE END.
