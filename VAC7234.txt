CUNNINGHAM, In the Office of the Clerk of the District Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.   TO THE MEMORY OF THS LITTIE BOOK  IS DEDICATED. Ivywall, Feb. 12, 1869.       PRELUDE. FAIRLEIGH PARK is a broad domain, and the residence of its lord a stately mansion. In the library of the mansion three or four gentlemen are seated. Ronald Montarges, the father of two of them, and lord of Fairleigh and many broad acres besides, is dead, and now his will is about to be opened. It is the 12th day of November, the year of our Lord 1759. With all due solemnity, the family lawyer reads the important document. Fairleigh Park is entailed, but the rest of the property, foiir estates in other parts of England, and one or two up among the gorse and heather of Scotland, is divided between the brothers, making them equally portioned-all but a cer- Main sum properly invested. This sum is not to be touched, principal or interest, by his heirs or their descendants, till a (V)   Vi.       PRELUDE. century had passed. Sealed letters, directed to each of his sons, and enclosed with a copy of the will, were endorsed: '"To be opened by the oldest living descendant of each or either of my sons, on the 12th of November, 1859." If both branches become extinct, the last of the family was to leave directions to his or her executor to open the letter, and act according to instruc- tions therein found. If the heirs refused to comply with this arbitrary arrangement, or they were to attempt to touch the money, it was all to be donated to some charitable purpose. The Montarges was a noble race, and neither son thought for one moment of interfering, or  of opening the letters which were handed down with care, and injunctions not to interfere, from father to son. ,Ronald Montarges, and Paul, his brother, were, at the time of their father's death, both married, and the father, respectively, of a son and daughter; these cousins married, thus uniting the two houses. In 1785 the twin son and daughter of this couple were also married. The daughter's husband was a Scotsman, Sir John Montrose, a man of good family, but of   PRELUDE.        vii. most careless and expensive--habits, whose pas- sion for horses and all kinds of gambling soon diminished his wife's large fortune, and con- siderably involved his brother-in-law. At his death, leaving one son to an empty title and a reduced rent-roll, the brother of Lady Montrose determined to rent Fairleigh Park and remove to America, and prevailed on his sister to ac- company him. They settled in Philadelphia, and as soon as Ronald Montarges' son or he married there) was of age, he cut off the entail, and Fairleigh Parl was sold. After his mother's death'the young baronet returned to England, but did not remain long. Returning to New York, he settled there, and gradually the intimacy between the families died out. So it happened that, in 1858, the Ronald Montarges then living did not know whether the Montrose branch was extinct or not. Ronald Montarges was living, at the time our story opens, in Philadelphia, rich enough to enjoy, if not all the luxuries, at least a few, and all the comforts of life; his wife, a Catholic lady, was dead, but his family consisted of two?: " I 8" i   Viii.      PRELUDE. daughters. Although an affectionate and kind husband and father, his intense interest in busi- ness made him at times seemingly neglect his family for his counting-house-the pride of the merchant taking precedence of all other inte- rests, sometimes to a cruel extent. His only- sister was living in New Orleans. This Ronald Montarges was the grandson of him who came over from England in 1790. f . --   THE LEGACY. CHAPTER   I. THE LEGACY. "Standing with reluctant feet, Where the brook and river meet, Womanhood and childhood fleet." "fX WISH I were rich!" The lips that spoke were rosy and fresh, and belongd to a fair girlish face, over whose ringetted head scarce seventeen surmmers had showered their dews and flowers. Helen Montarges gave promise of great love-'  liness. But the same could not be said of her sister Gertrude, a year younger than herself,    ^ whose plain face and figure bore' little reser- : ? blance to the sparkling beauty at her side. "I do want to be rich--I do so enjoy spending money!, (9)   10    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "Helen! Helen!" said a calm, sweet voice near her, "I don't like to hear you speak so, my child." "Why not, sister Anita?" asked the young girl; "there is no harm in being rich if one makes good use of the money;. where is the crime of wearing silk dresses and jewelry? I wish I had a pair of bracelets: as soon as I go home, Papa must give me a pair! I do admire bracelets," and she drew her sleeve-a loose one -back from an arm Hebe might have envied, and encircled her wrist with her thumb and fore-finger. "Now, sister Anita, you are rash judging me -you know you are!" cried the impulsive girl, throwing her arms around- the sister, who, during this last sally, had looked rather dis- pleased. "How do you know that I would do wrong with money if I had it? No, indeed: I'd give to the poor and The church, and, oh! I'd send you such a beamtiful present, sister, just to make you ashamed of thinking so badly of me: what shall it be?-Oh, I know-a large painting of that 'Dream of the Infant Jesus' you are so fond of-yes, that is just the thing!" "My dear," said the sister, laying her hand   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     " on Helen's shoulder, "when you set up your carriage and want a crest, how about a magpie rampant?" Helen laughed and colored slightly, but the hitherto silent Gertrude spoke: "Oh, Helen need not invent a crest: the Montarges' coat of arms is as old, as the tilme of Henry V ll." "Ah, Gerty," said the sister, smilingly, shaking her finger, " and the Montarges' pride too, I fear." "Well said, Gerty!" cried Helen. "Who'd have thought my quiet sis. knew so much! I am sure I never gave the coat of arms a thought, except to look at it sometimes, hanging over the library mantle,-or amuse myself with the large seal fastened to Papa's desk by a silver chain." "I would advise you, He  " Gertrude was interrupted by the clear, melo- dious bell that rung out the Angelus. Friends! companions of the long ago! albeit the cares and sorrows, the hopes and joys of after life, have so come between you and your childhood, that the last seems but as a dream- though your hearts are so changed from the careless innocence of those early days, that even * .  }   ;   J    12 X    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. to yourselves you seem beings of another nature -have you ever heard the Angelus, whether rung from the campanile of some stately cathe- dral, or the modest belfry of some simple coun- try church, without the magic wand of memory bringing before you the "Valley" up there among Maryland's Blue Mountains, and the tones of the sweet bell that rung it from St. Joseph's chapel? The sun was just touching the highest point of "Carrick's Knob" as the Angelus rung out that lovely June evening in the year 1858; the air had been full of the gay girlish voices, but in an instant every voice was hushed, and nearly every head bowed in silent prayer. When the bell had ceased, and they rose. from their knees, Gertrude said: "Rhetoric claims my attention for the rest of the evening, sister, so I must leave you." "Oh, you dear, good, studious Gerty!--please learn mine too!" said Helen. "I must go away now, Helen, for you must not waste your time; to-morrow is examination day," said the sister. "No, don't," replied Helen, catching the beads that hung at her side, "stay here and let me sit    THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    13 on this smooth grass at your feet, and I'll study." "I fear you cannot be trusted-remember the magpie, Helen!-no I must go." So Gertrude said "good night," and moved quietly away; Helen, still holding to the sis- ter's beads, followed her into the house and to the green door, which was the boundary line between the school and sisterhood.    !     14     THE MONTARGES' LEGACY.

To a "St. Jo- seph's girl" what a day it is! The early mass in the beautiful chapel, with the statue of the mother and child, under the marble canopy over the marble altar, looking down upon the bent heads, some bowed before it for the last time, was always a sad service. The ties of many years, the silver chain that had bound so many young hearts together, and to their older friends and preceptresses, is broken to-day, and, with sad souls and tearful eyes, we see the loved links severed. For the great doors of the House of Life are thrown open to us this   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      15 day, and with beating hearts we cross the threshold for weal or woe, as tine only can unfold. Hitherto we had, as it were, lingered on the pathway leading up to the house, culling a flower here, there pausing to listen to the sing- ing of a bird, and if the flowers sometimes had thorns, or the bird flew away when we ap- proached nearer to hear it better, why, the sting was soon over, another songster, as sweet or sweeter than that one, drew our attention, and the passing pain was gone. The silent breakfast is quickly finished, for the appetites are dulled by the thought that it is the last meal to be taken in the old refectory. And many glances are cast at the pulpit at the head of the room, by the Directress' seat, whence the "spiritual reading" was made during the meals. Then comes the grand toilets in the dormi- tories, where for once the injunction of silence is removed, and busy tongues keep time to busy fingers. After that the forming in procession in the long passage, and the hushed murmur of expectation, when the closed doors of the "Dis- tribution Room" are opened for a moment to admit the eight girls who, on harps and pianos,    16     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. are to perform  "Deilman's Grand Entrance March." The measured strains begin, the doors are thrown back again, and two and two comes the long procession. Helen and Gertrude, with three others, formed the senior class, and .of the five names, that of Gertrude Montarges sounded the most frequently through the room. Helen's fair face beamed with delight at her young sister's success; love left no room for jealousy. At length the time came for singing the "Farewell ;" this, too, was Gertrude's composi- tion, and she, with Helen and those who are to join in the chorus, take their places on the plat- form by the musical instruments; the melody is a simple one, and suits the words. Helen's and Gertrude's voices alternate through the verses, but together they sing the last one- "As the timid dove, when the falcon's nigh, To it's home in the greenwood fain would fly; So our weary hearts, when by grief opprest, Shall long 'mid these halcyon scenes to rest. Sweet vale of St. Joseph's, to thee do we tell, Our vouth'slovley Eden, a sad, sad farewell!" Well! the Distribution is over, and eager friends gather round with glad congratulations.   v.      TTHE MONTARGES LEGACY.      17 Mr. Montarges greets his daughters with happy pride. They are not to leave " the Valley" till the next morning, and, loth to lose the last sweet pleasure of lingering beneath the classic shades of the linden trees, Helen and Gertrude decline accompanying their father to the village, where many of the girls look forward to a gay evening with those "mountain boys," who have re- mained since the commencement the day before, to witness the triumph of sister or cousin, or to gratify their curiosity in regard to the interior of the sisterhood. The   silence bell" is ringing, and, for tne first time in the eight years she has been within its hearing, Gertrude Montarges allows its last sound to die away ere she moves to obey it. She is standing on the study room steps, looking with tear-dimmed eyes on the lovely scene. The play ground lies before her, with its broad paths and velvet turf, the shrines in the centre of the grass plats, and the gem-like chapel at the foot, dedicated to "Our Lady of the Vale ;" the rustic seats scattered here and there, and    18     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. the gate through which she had so often gone to visit '"Mother Rose's Grotto." Looking over the gentle waters of "Tom's Creek," the white belfry of "Mt. St Mary's" gleams out among the trees, nestling at the foot of the grand old mountain, over whose crest the clouds are still tinged with the last glory of the setting sun. At length she turns away, and takes her place in the study room, where the vacant chairs are a sad reminder of ties so lately severed. With stately step the Directress sweeps to her place, and, kneeling, begins the night prayers. Heil   THE MONTARGES LEGCACY.     19 CHAPTER   III. "She was like A dream of poetry that may not be Written or told-exceeding beautiful." YOUNG as she was, Helen's grace and beau- ty attracted universal admiration, and though her father would have preferred that she remained quietly at home the first winter of her return from school, he soon found himself powerless to prevent the constant temp- tations (or rather to overcome them) that were offered by " society,"of which his daughter was at once pronounced the queen. Helen drank   eagerly of the cup of pleasure thus presented to her lips, and many fears arose in the minds of those who loved her, that the torrent of admiration, praise, and flattery pour- ing upon her, would leave a tarnish on her soul.   20    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. But she was guarded by her own pure heart and deep religious spirit front the many evils that lay in her path, and the adulations and universal admiration which greeted her on every side, seemed to make no impression on the beautiful girl. No flattery, however softly spoken, brought a blush of gratification to her cheek; no compliment, however elegantly turned, seemed to wake a touch of pride. Full of life and spirits, and hearty enjoyment of everything that offered, she was never up so late the night before, that the nearest church was not the scene of her morning devotions during the seven o'clock mass. Gentle and graceful in her manners, no one could complain of neglect, while no one could boast of favor.  She kept all at a certain distance, and it seemed the pure waters of her heart were never stirred save by her love for father and sister. So Helen Montarges was a mystery to all who knew her, and she was alike laughed at, sneered at, and praised, according to the dis- position of those around her. There was another side of Helen's life, of which hardly even Gertrude knew.    Many of the ultra-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     21 fashionables had remarked upon the fact that Helen Montarges was guilty of the bad taste of wearing even her simple evening dresses three and four times, only varying the trimmings; and it was discovered, too, that sometimes a dress made over entirely, did duty as a fresh new one--none knew how the money thus saved from what her indulgent father allowed her, and which was as much as he could afford, went to the comfort of some poor family, or the saving of some wretch from hunger and crime. Thus Helen went calmly on, unaffected by praise or blame, doing her duty as her noble heart dictated, whether in the " halls of dazzling light," the cottage of the poor, or at the bedside of the dying. And Gertrude, dear, gentle, quiet Gertrude, "ugly"Gertrude, as some call her, who only see the dark skin and irregular features, notic- ing not the large brown eyes that have such a wealth of love in their dark depths; how has Gertrude spent the first winter of her " young- lady-hood?" Her life was a quiet one of dreams and duties, undisturbed by any great fatiguing gaieties;  dreams that all women, whether plain or beau- ; , , .   22    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. , tiful, feed their hearts with until the lengthened chain of years shows the futility of them- duties such as fall to the lot of the plain daughter of the house; small cares which seemed so properly hers there was never a ques- tion of her attending to them. She, too, had her round of charities, and many a pair of gloves were mended to the last endurance of the kid; many a pair of shoes were inked, when the morocco began to rub, to look well till the last, that a poor woman might have a warm shawl; some invalid be supplied with delicacies beyond his or her means. Between the sisters there was perfect love. Gertrude gloried in Helen's beauty and the praise it elicited; no spark of jealousy arose in Helen's mind because it was on Gertrude their father depended for his home comforts and attentions. Thus passed the first winter of their life after leaving school, and in April came Helen's eighteenth birthday. Very lovely looked she in her clouds of tarle- ton and the golden glimmer of her auburn hair. The bracelets are unfazit accomrpli, and gleam on her round arms, and her dark blue eyes are   THE MONTARGES. LEGACY.         23 glistening with the light of youth and happi- ness: very fair and lovely. On the evening of that 27th day of April a gay party is assembled to do honor to the occasion. Gertrude watched Helen's childlike enjoy- ment, more with the pleasure of an older sister or aunt than that of one younger and as capable of enjoying life as herself.  Certainly Ger- trude is not handsome, but  a  careful ob- server would findl much intellect and  power in her face that     is wanting in  her  admired sister. During the evening-,a carda was handed to Mr. Montarges, bearing the name     " Ronald Mon- trose Beresford," and /he gentleman, the ser- vant said, was waiting in the library. Thither Mr Montarges hurried,. anticipating from the christian names of the stranger, that he was of the Montrose branch. Nor was he mistaken, for Ronald, or, as he was mostly called, Mon- trose-- Beesford; was a great-grandson of the young Sir Ronald Montrose, whom   his mother had brought to this country a     mere boy, so many years ago. Mr. Montarges greeted his young kinsman heartily, and after a   little hesi- tation on the score of dress, the young    man  24    THE MONTARGES LEGAOC. & consented to join the company and be presented to his cousins.  "One word," said Mr. Montarges, delaying as they turned to leave the room, and pointing to the letter relating to the legacy, which Mon- trose had brought with him, that there might be no doubt as to his identity, and which he was about replacing in his pocket-- one word -my daughters know nothing of this legacy, and I do not wish them to be enlightened on the subject until the time comes for opening the letters-so no word on the subject; do you understand?W) "Perfectly," replied Montrose, bowing. ," Then we will join the company below, and surprise the girls not a little," and together they descended the staircase. As Montrose Beresford is an important mem- ber of our i' dramatis persone," we wil leave him at the end of this chapter, making his bow before a dazzling vision of white tarleton and golden hair, and devote a portion or the whole of another to him.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      25 CH APTER IV. "Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air, and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagin'd happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter." RONALD MONTROSE BERESFORD possessed in- a remarkable degree the great beauty of his family. Tall and finely formed, though slight, it was the extreme beauty of his face that generally attracted attention; his well shaped head, set firmly on his shoulders, was covered with clustering curls of black silky hair, his forehead was high and broad, his clear gray eyes, deep set in their sockets, and overshadowed by the heavy brow and long black lashes, looked black themselves some- t   26    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. times; his lips were chiseled and had, in repose, a stern expression; but when the teeth, even and white, were exposed by a smile of singular sweetness, the whole face was lighted with a softer beauty. He was at this time just twenty, "the only son of his mother, and she a widow." During the evening, Mr. Montarges learned what had brought his young kinsman to the city. His mother was with him. They had left the small town in New York--where she had, resided, in order that, by strict economy, she might be enabled to give her son the advan- tages of a good education-at the invitation of a gentleman in business in Philadelphia, who, meeting Montrose the summer before, had taken a great interest in him. Mr. Wharton, being childless himself, had offered to receive the young man into his office, and further his interests as far as in his power. 1"This is fortunate, my boy," said Mr. Mon- targes: "for you know that next November is the period named for the opening of the mys- terious letters, and I confess I was much at a loss how to proceed to find out who of the Montrose branch was living, and where. Do   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     27 you know the sum of the legacy at the present time?" "Indeed, I do not, sir. - I have often looked at the envelope with its strange inscription, and wondered what effect upon my future-the open- ing would make. I hope, for my dear mother's sake, that her last years will be provided for amply; for myself, I have my own right arm and strength with which to fight the world- but I confess to a great ignorance on the sub- ject." "Well, the sum invested so strangely by that old ancestor of ours, has reached the amount of 4,000,000 pounds; but what is to be the final settlement of the matter, we will not know till the 12th of November next. Ah! here comes Gertrude, so no more on the subject." The evening came to an end, and, after re- ceiving the assurances of his new found rela- tives that they would call upon his mother imniediately, Montrose took his leave of them, and returned to the boarding-house where he at present made his home, and dreamed all night of a figure in cloudlike drapery, crowned with a small head, "sunned over with curls" that threatened to escape from the comb each   28    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. minute, and cover the fair shoulders with a mantle of spun gold. "Mother, darling," said the young man, bending over his mother at the breakfast table the next morning, "did you think I had run away last night?" "No, dear, I only supposed you found your new relations very attractive." "And so I did; Cousin Montarges has two daughters, one, the loveliest being I ever be- held-Helen, they call her, and she deserves her name, for if Helen of Troy was half as beautiful as my-as this Helen, I don't wonder at the war that was made about her. Yester- day was Helen's birthday, and there was an evening company at the house." "What of the other daughter, Montrose; you say there were two " "Oh, she's a dark, ugly little thing-I hardly saw anything of her; but you will have an opportunity of judging soon for yourself, for they are coming to see you. I wish I knew when they would come; I believe I would in- augurate a character for irregularity with Mr. "Wharton before I have been in his employment a week, by leaving the office about the hour   HE MONTARGES LEGACY.     29 for visitors, just to see her with her bonnet on!" "You foolish boy!-as if you would not have plenty of chances of seeing the bewitching Helen with and without her bonnet to your heart's content." That evening a visit to the Montarges' house did " not seem so out of place," Montrose said, as he must pay a " party call." Helen was very cordial in her greeting, although her slumbers had been disturbed the night before by no visions of a pictured face. The next day the sisters called on their new cousin, and bore with them their father's re- grets that he could not add his welcome in per- son as soon as he wished.  Mrs. Beresford's gentle manners and warm greeting won the girls' hearts at once ; but she, while she admired Helen's beauty and vivacity, and the childlike confidence her manners displayed, turned more towards the "ugly"Gertrude.   The tender admiration of her sister that showed a loving heart free from jealousy; the bright intelli- gence that shone from her eyes, and the readi- ness, without presumption, with which she spoke on most subjects, showed a nmind of no   30    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. mean order, and well cultivated, and awakened in the elder lady a feeling of confidence and affection almost at once. When her son came in she told him what he had missed, and then, seeing his look of dis- appointment, said, ' If you are a good boy, my dear, I'll tell you of a treat in store for you." "Tell it right off" he cried, catching her in his arms, " or I'll hug and kiss you till you do," suiting the action to the words. "Mercy, mercy," laughed his mother, I'll tell you, if you only give me breathing time; there," as her son released her, "you have crushed my collar out of all shape! We are to dine with Mr and the Misses Montarges on Sunday next." "And this is Thursday! I suppose a fellow can't go there till then, even to pay an evening visit," said Montrose disconsolately, subsiding into a chair, and burying his hands in his pockets. "No, I don't think " a fellow " need, under the circumstances-so short an acquaintance, &c,; besides, "a fellow"I know owes some- thing to his mother, I think."   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     31 "You dear old mother! don't get jealous- what shall I do for you?" "Don't make a goose of yourself, son of mine, and see first if your cousin Helen is free, before you fall irredeemably in love with her! For my part, I prefer that "ugly little thing, Gertrude." "Prefer Gertrude to Helen!" But the entrance of a servant, and the ring- ing of the dinner bell, put an end to the con- versation. The boarding-house at which- Mr. Wharton had taken rooms for the Beresfords was in the lower part of the city, a great distance from the street in which the Montarges lived.    This was a distressing matter to Montrose, for it prevented any chance meetings with his cousins.   32     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CfHAP'TER V. "A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.' FTER the birth-night a change came over Helen, imperceptible at first. Her father and sister, after a while, began to notice it, and were at a loss to account for it. They were at a loss, too, to say, in what it consisted, for it was too impalpable to be put into words, yet it was there. She was as cheerful as before; and seemingly as fond of gaiety, but spent more of her time in silent thought, and often Gertrude had sur- prised her on her knees. Her love for her father and sister seemed to take a more demon- strative form than its previous quiet current. There was but one solution in Gertrude's mind, and that was that Montrose Beresford's undisguised admiration and devotion had awak-   THE MOlNTARGES LEGACY.    33 ened some hitherto undreamed of feeling in Helen's heart. To say that Montrose had "' fallen" in love at first sight would not be strictly true; he had plunged into the depths headlong, heedless of his mother's prudent warning. It was an easy matter to find excuses for spending three or four evenings in Rittenhouse Square every week--books, or music, or some walk to be taken after office hours, in the pleasant summer evenings. Montrose had a fine baritone voice, which his fondness Tor music led him to culti- vate highly, besides, he played- the flute with exquisite taste and feeling. One day the sisters were in the pleasant little room over the hall, in the second story of the -house, which, looking out on the beautiful trees in the square, formed a cosy sitting-room for the two, and where, presuming on his cousinship, Montrose had been allowed to pene- trate on the one or two occasions when he had called in the morning. "Well, Helen, we have known the Beresfords now nearly two months-what is your opinion of our new cousins?" asked Gertrude. "Of Mrs. Beresford there can be but one,-   34:    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. that she is perfectly lovely; she resembles very much our darling sister Anita-don't you think she does?" replied Helen. "Yes, I soon noticed the resemblance; but what of Montrose? Poor fellow; his opinion of you, Helen, is apparent enough." "Oh, Gertrude, I don't think he has a higher opinion of me than of you; it is only cousinly regard and boyish freedom." "Ah, Helen, I think  it is more than ' cousinly regard ;' you know lookers-on judge better of such things sometimes than the parties most interested-but I thought you saw it i" "' Speak plainly, Dame Durden--what is it you want me to understand?" 1' That our cousin Montrose loves you, my dear sister; that is not such a terrible thing, is it?"  Gertrude sighed unconsciously-how strange it is, the blindness of those favored ones, to whose unwilling lips is held the cup for which some thirsty soul is longing, oh, so fer- veutly! "A terrible thing! Oh, Gerty, I hope you are not correct in this surmise-Gerty, Gerty, I hope you are not!" and Helen's large blue eyes had a strange frightened look in them.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     85 "Why, Helen darling, what is the matter? Is the idea of Montrose Beresford's love so fear- ful to you?"There was a tinge of bitterness in Gertrude's voice, that brought a blush to her cheek, though Helen did not notice it. ' Gertrude, he must not love me; no man must, for I shall never marry." "Never marry! Helen, you are, the last woman in the world to say that; and Montrose, though not rich, is in every way worthy of you." "Dear Gertrude," said Helen, dropping on her knees, and burying her face in her sister's lap; "let me tell you my cherished secret, and beg your help to break it to our father. I do not care to live in the world-my one thought for some time past has been to join the Sisters at St. Joseph's." - '"Helen!" 'C I am glad I have told you, Dame Durden, for no one has known of my intention but Father Arnoth, and I have so wished to talk to you about it, and yet dreaded to make the be- ginning." "Dear Helen, what will papa say?" said Ger- trude, gently carressing the golden head bent   36    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. low before her. "My dear sister, do you think he will give his consent?" "You must help me to win it, Gertrude ; if he does not give it " "You would not go without it, Helen!" "No--you did not allow me time to finish-- if he does not give it now I will wait and pray that God will change his heart, for no other life will make me happy." 6 And I, oh, my darling sister, how can I ever give you up!" cried Gertrude, bursting into tears. , "You and papa are all I have--how can I lose you "!"

Just then the door bell rung, and not being answered on the instant, rung again, the win- dow shutters were bowed, and Gertrude quietly took a reconnoissance, but she was not ouick   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    37 enough, for Montrose, knowing the habit of the girls to sit in that room, looked up, and she was caught in the act. Gaily kissing his hand, he said: "Where is Bridget or Mary, that you keep your poor relations out in the heat so long? Ah!" he continued, as the door was opened, "may I come up?" "Yes," replied Gertrude, and before Helen could escape he had mounted the staircase, three steps at a time, and was with them. "Why, what is the matter?" he cried, look- ing into their discomposed faces. "Dame Dur- den, you look as if--but I beg your pardon, 'tis none of my business, and I am a thoughtless chatter-box. Do you know what brought me down upon you this morning?" "Not having our guessing caps on, we must * admit we do not-unless it was the pleasure of our society," said Helen, laughing. "The latter is always an attraction," replied Montrose, with a Grandisonian bow; "but to- day I have another, additional reason. Mr. Wharton, in consideration of my distinguished services, has granted me a holiday and, re- membering your promise to pilot my mother 4   38     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. and myself to and along the romantic banks of the Wissahicklon some time this summer, I have come to ask if you can or will go to- morrow?" ' There is nothing to prevent-is there, Helen?" asked Gertrude. "No, I believe not." "Then to-morrow it is?" asked Montrose. ("Yes, we are at your service." He rattled on about fifty different matters, in his boyish careless manner, and, at length, look- ing at his watch, said: '"If you feel like it, suppose we try that trio from Bellisario; I have yet twenty minutes of my recess hour." They descended to the parlor, and soon the rich accord of their harmonious voices filled the house with that saddest, sweetest melody. When he had gone, Helen sought her own room, and Gertrude went about some house- hold duty, with an unconfessed, unbidden feel- ing of relief in her heart, that she did not stop to analyze--at least, then: but she meant to take herself to task for it when she had the time to dissect her heart, and leave no corner uncovered from her knowledge. There was no   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     39 maudlin sentimentalism in Gertrude's charac- ter: she would allow no weak indulgence of a feeling she knew she must not entertain. And such a feeling she knew was present in her heart, and must be rooted out, branch and fibre, only it required a longer time than she could take now, and so she put it back with a: stern resolve to have done with it as soon as possible. In preparing for dinner, she let down the heavy coils of her dark chestnut hair, and as she stood before the glass, was almost enveloped in it; she scanned her face narrowly, and then shook her head. "'Don't be silly, Gertrude," she said to herself: 'ugly you are, and ugly you will remain till the end of the chapter, so call common sense to your aid, and don't keep them waiting for dinner." Then she twisted the heavy mass around and around her beautiful head till It formed a natu- ral coronet, and descended to the dining-room to await her father's coming. Helen had a headache, and sent word she only wanted a cup of tea.   40     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER VI. - True religion Is always mild, propitious, and humble; Plays not the tyrant ; plants no faith in blood; Nor bears destruction on her chariot wheels, But stops to polish succour and redress, And builds her grandeur on the public good." THE  morning dawned brightly beautiful; and after breakfast the girls made their preparations and started to join their cousins at the corner of Fourth and Arch Streets, to take the cars. Mrs. Beresford was charmed with the ro- mantic beauty of the wild wooded banks of the stream, and she and Gertrude soon found themselves alone, having wandered, in their pleasant talk, some distance from the others. Whether it was that the religious quiet of the woods moved Mrs. Beresford to speak, or   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    41 that she had only wanted the opportunity beqore, we will not say, but, after wandering along the banks of the stream some distance, she said, pointing to a tree near: "Let us seat ourselves there, Gertrude, and wait for that loitering couple; meanwhile, I have a confes- sion to make to you; I have been wishing to make it for some time." "A confession to mze, cousin Margaret!" ' Yes; don't be alarmed, Dame Durden; I am prepared for the surprise you may express. Would you not be very much startled if I told you I had thoughts of becoming a Catholic?" "Cousin Margaret!" "Yes; it is so; you know I have told you of having gone several times to St. Mary's Ato hear the vespers. Well, last Sunday I went to St. Joseph's in the morning, and heard a sermon on the sixth chapter of St. John. When I came home I looked into my bible and found that we have the very same words: unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood ye shall not have life in ye!' and again, where the Jews said: 'this is hard- how can this man give us his flesh to eat,' his reply was: 'my flesh is meat indeed, my   42    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. blood is drink indeed,' &c.-you know the -rest. Well, I have been thinking very much about it since, and my mind is much disturbed on the subject. The words are so emphatic, and yet the Episcopal and all Protestant Churches only say with the Jews,' this is a hard saying,' and refuse to believe it. Ger- trude, can't you help me? I am so anxious to know the truth and to embrace it!" "Dear Cousin Margaret, you do indeed sur- prise me, and if I can help you I will, but I am a poor controversialist, so I fear I cannot afford you much assistance. I feel all the glory and satisfaction of being a Catholic, and would rather lose my life than my precious faith, but I fear I cannot explain to you all you would like to know." "I thought, in coming to, you, I would have all my doubts and anxieties set at rest." "Thank you for your good opinion of me, but let me introduce you to our Bishop; he is a convert, and has, of course, gone through all the doubts and anxieties you speak of-he can help you much better than I." "But his time is precious; I might be in- truding."   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     43 "Oh no; he will make time for you. Will you go?" "Yes, I will. On so important a subject it is well not to procrastinate. The belief in the real presence and the necessity of confession are my greatest stumbling-blocks; I can not under- stand the mystery." "No one can; we must remember     that ' blessed are they who have believed and have not seen.'" "Yes, that is true. I shall be glad when my doubts are set at rest, for there is so much that is beautiful and consoling in your faith." "It is all beautiful, cousin Margaret; the words of the canticle point to the Church: ' Thou art all beautiful, oh my beloved, and there is no spot in thee;' even confession will prove itself such a support and consolation, that you will wonder how you lived without it." c' I don't know, Gerty,' the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."' "The spirit will strengthen the flesh.

They take it up gladly, and, in the dress of their glowing words, it is greeted as a new and most beautiful idea." "Yes; Tennyson has much that is Catholic in his poetry." "ANothng that more beautifully expresses our faith in prayer for the dead than the lines in the 'Morte d'Arthur;' do    you  remem- ber them?"' "If thou should'st never see my face again Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer Than this worlld dreams of. Wherefore let thy voice Rise like a fountain for me night and day.

For so the wihole r'ound earth7 is every wzay Bound by gold chains about the feet of God!" Gertrude's voice trembled with enthusiasm as she ceased, anlld a fire lighted up her dark lus- trous eyes, making her look almost beautiful. Mrs. Beresford did not speak, but watched her with genuine admiration for a few moments.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY. -   45 The silence lasted for a while, and then Ger- trude said: "So you will go to see the Bishop?" "Gladly; when shall it be?" "At your own convenience, cousin Marga- ret; I can go at any time." "Well, shall we say to-morrow?" "At what hour? Twelve, I guess, would be the best; we would be surer to find him at home." "Very well, then, say twelve. - By the bye, where are those children?" "Let us walk back and we may meet them," said Gertrude. They both rose and retraced their steps. Some distance back they met the two "lost children" slowly coming towards them. A glance at Helen's distressed face, and Montrose's sad one, showed that something unusual had occurred. fl    "     THE: IONTARGES LEGACY. "H APTER    V II. "Helen, I love thee--by my life I do; I swear by that which I will lose for thee, To prove him false, who says I love thee not." B EFT to themselves, Helen and Montrose had found a charming little nook by the bank of the stream, and she, stoop- ing to examine some mosses, he threw ]himself on the ground beside her, saying: "Don't let's go any further, Helen, the view here is beauti- ful, and see-here is a cluster of violets and other wild flowers:- 'In eastern lands they talk in flowers, And they tell in a garland their loves and cares Each blossom that blooms in their garden bowers, On its leaves a mystic lacnguarge bears; Then gather a wreath from the garden bowers, And tell the wish of thy heart in flowers.'

"Well, there 1"He reached with a hooked stick he had picked up, and caught the handle of the basket on it, and laid it safely at her feet.

"There we used to go sometimes to the mountain, some- times just down to the creek, and once a year always to the ' Three Hills.' On that occasion we rode in great, heavy, high wagons without springs, with straw on the floor, and no seats; dear me! such a jolting, and what fun it was!" "Rather hard fulln; didn't the ride tire you?" "Tire us! no; we always managed to get into the wagon in which our particularly admired sister was, and her society made us forget the jolts and ruts. Suppose we try to find Dame Durden and Cousin Margaret now I'd rather walk than sit here." "No, please don't go yet-don't you see that I am weaving a wreath to deck your brow?" He had been busy fastening some oak leaves together by inserting the stems of one into the next, and, while Helen was talking, had made a beautiful coronet. "There! now take off your hat, Helen, and let me trim it with this; fair Dryad, it is a most suitable adornment." She obeyed him, and he fastened the wreath over the straw cord and tassel that encircled it. Then he placed the hat on her head, and drew   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    49 back to judge of the effect, and she looked laughingly up to speak, when the impetuous boy threw himself on his knees at her side, exclaiming: "You are very beautiful, Helen:- and oh! my cousin, I love you dearly-there!" seeing her movement of surprise, "I know I am a fool to tell you, but I have loved you ever since I first saw you; and if you can only love me, I will work night and day to be worthy of you, and to  "Helen stopped his flow of words by a gesture: - Hush, Montrose, hush!

Helen's face was flushed antl her voice trembled, but she managed to say all she wished. "V What do you mean?--yon are not going to bury yourself in a convent?" "No, Montrose, I do not mean to bury my- self; but the longing of my heart, the deepest wish I have on earth is to join the order of the Sisters of Charity. No other life will be a happy one to me." "Helen! you are not in earnest? you do not mean to hide your beauty under that disfiguring white head-geear, wear out your life in the hard, disgusting work those women devote them- selves to?" "I am in earnest, Montrose," replied Helen, rising. "If I am beautiful--and," she addled, simply, "as every one says I am, I suppose it is true-I thank God for the gift in making my poor body more worthy His acceptance. My youth I gladly lay at His feet, begging His direction so to employ my best years, as to win His blessings on my old age. So, dear Mon-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     51  trose, we will be friends ever I hope, only this subject must never be mentioned between us." She smiled a winning smile and held out her hand to him, but his gaze was fixed on her face, which, when she began to speak, became transformed into that of an angel to his excited fancy, as the inspiration of her thoughts passed into her features. 6 Will you not shake hands and be friends?" she said aagain.

CHAPTER   VALI. "What is truth?-a staff rejected." GERTRUDE's meditations took a sad turn when she found herself alone, and yet they took no definite formi, or, rather, she would allow herself no indulgence on the sub- ject; she had not yet fouught the battle 'she knew she must before long, so she gave herself little chance to indulge in fancies. She kept her appointment with Mrs. Beres- ford, but nothing was said of Helen or Mon- trose on their way to the cathedral the next day. They found the Bishop at home, and Mrs. Beresford was much pleased with his kind manner. She spoke of her desire to know more of the faith, and asked his assistance. He gave her some excellent books to read, and promised,   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      53 to call and see her as soon as he could make the time. On leaving the Bishop's house Gertrude ac- companied her cousin down Clhesnut Street a little distance, as she had some little matters to attend to. At parting, Mrs. Beresford handed her a note, and asked her to give it to Helen; she saw it was from  Montrose, but made no remark. When she got home she gave the note to Helen, whom she found in their little sitting- room, and was going up stairs to her own room when Helen called her back. "Don't go away, Gerty; what is Montrose writing about?" and she opened the note and read it in silence. Gertrude returned to the room and took off her bonnet and shawl. "Dear Gertrude, " said Helen, handing her the note, "you guessed what passed between us yesterday, I do not doubt. Your prediction was indeed true. Can you tell me why he should make this request?"Gertrude read: ' DARLING--I am forbidden to speak on the subject, of our conversation yesterday, and I know that prohibition included writing also.

"What does he mean, Gertrude?" "Indeed, I do not know." "Suppose we ask papa?" "Oh-no; don't do that! Do you not see he has promised to kieep the secret! Papa may be displeased that we know so much; it is clearly not our place to ask any questions." "You are right, as you always are, Dame Durden," said Helen, kissing her sister; " was cousin Margaret pleased with her visit?" "Yes; delighted." "She is really in earnest about becoming a Catholic? I wonder if her conversion would affect Montrose?" "I guess not; Montrose is too light and gay to give much thought to religion just now." "Well, the change may come in time; and now, dear Gerty, how can I tell papa of my   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     55 desire to leave him? It Crust be done soon, since I have been obliged to mention it to others." "Poor papa! it will be a (great blow to him; he is so piooud of you, Helen." "I know it. I have asked Father Arnoth to pray for him and for me. I am a very coward in the matter, and do so dread the opposition that I know I'll m1eet." "Shall I tell him, Helen?" asked Gertrude. "Will you? oh, my dea- sister, it will be such a relief to me if you will." "I dread it almost as much as yg do, Helen; but if you wish it, I will speak th him, and to- night if you don't say no; it is better to do it as soon as possible, and have it over." "Yes, when you please." Then Gertrude gathered up her street attire and sought, her own room. ' That evening Montrose came, but with no "forward and frolic glee;" he was quiet and subdued, and although Helen's greeting gave him the assurance he had asked, it was only partial in its effects. There were several other visitors, and Helen's time and attention were fully occupied.   56    THE MONTARGES iLEGACY. Gertrude, feeling anxious and out of tune with the common-place chit-chat that was going on around her, left the parlor, and sought her father in the library. She had been thinking all day how it would be best to open her mission to him, and could come to no decision, so she left it to the impulse of the moment. Going up to him as he sat at the library table, she laid her hand on his shoulder, and said- "I have something to say to you, papa; are you very busy?" "Never too busy to attend to either of my children," replied her father drawing her down on his knee: N What does Dame Durden want?" "Nothing for myself, but Helen  Helen wants me to tell you something for her." "VIrhy does not Helen come herself?" : Because, dear father, she knows what she wishes will give you pain, and she has not the courage to see it." "Poor Helen; well, what is it?" "You know  how happy we were at St. Joseph's," began Gertrude, pushing the still dark hair off her father's forehead, " and, in spite of all the pleasures of the trip to the   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     57 mountains last summer, how homesick for the old schoolhome Helen was?" "Yes, I remember all that; surely she has gotten over that fancy after last winter, and all the flattery and attention she received; she does not wish to resume the role of school-girl and return to St. Joseph's." '"You are partly right, papa ; she does wish to return to St. Joseph's, but not in the role of scholar." "How then? Not, oh not, Gertrude, as a Sister?" exclaimed Mr. Montarges, for the first time taking the-alarm. "Yes, dear papa, as a Sister!" "  My God!"Mr. Montarges covered his face with his hands and sat silent; Gertrude stole an arm round his neck and was silent also. At last, with an effort, Aer father roused himself from his position, and exclaimed: "' Oh Helen! my pride, my beauty! I cannot give you up. No, Gertrude, tell your sister not to mention the subject to me, and to forget -her foolish fancy as soon as she can." (' It is no foolish fancy, dear father, but an unalterable determination." "And would she brave my authority? a fit   58    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. beginning for a religious life! or else your re- ligion teaches strange ideas of duty!" "No, no, papa; she will not go unless you give your consent; she assured me of that, but  'I "Then I shall not trouble myself any more about the matter. My consent she never shall have, nor do I wish to hear anything on the subject again." Gertrude made a movement to go, but her father drew her close up to him, saying, as he patted her cheek: "And Dame D urden has nothing to ask for?" "Nothing, papa." "You have no wish to leave me, dear?" "Indeed no, papa; I only wish I could take I-elen's place as well as my own, for you are all the world to me, lly precious father!" "Thanls, dear child, and ,never have a fear that any one could for one moment rob you of the place you hold in your father's heart; and now good-night, for I was very much engaged when you came in, and have a serious case unDder consideration."  Returning her father's good-night kiss, Ger- trude left the room, and Mr. Montarges was   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     59 alone. He sat for sometime lost in painful reverie, then rose and paced the floor. Thought and memory were busy within him; the sweet, gentle voice of his lost wife came before him, and reminded him of his promise to allow the girls full freedom in matters of religion. But not so far as this-not in so foolish a desire as has taken hold of Helen.!" he said to hinself; But he could not silence conscience; even as he- repeated some excuse to hil-mself, would come the pleading face of his dead wife. Then in answer to the whisperings of worldly pride and ambition that came so quickly to his mindl, were the remembrance of the utter self-abnega- tion that had led so many noble and beautifiul women to forego all the delights of worldly honor and pride of place, to devote themselves to Christ, by denying themselves, taking up the Cross and followingt-Iim; and in his ear seemed whispered the words: "What shall it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul." After hours of mental struggle Mr. Montarges made up his mind to rescind the determination he had so hastily formed, and to speak to Helen on the subject and judge fobr himself if it was a fixed resolution, or   60 -    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. merely a phase of the childish home-sickness for her old school that had affected her so strongly at first. He could not understand how she, so young, beautiful, and with the world at her feet, could give all up for the serge dress and the hard life. Having decided on his action, long after the house was silent for the night, Mr. Montarges sought his bedroom.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     61 CHAPTER   IX. ," Return my thoughts, come home Ye wild and winged!" HEAVING the library, Gertrude sought her own room; the strain upon her mental powers had been great, though she was so calm toaoutward seeming. Now, she sought her own room to fight the battle between heart and pride, and be done wi^th it. And a weary battle it was! For, far above all the whisperings of pride, rose the cry of her heart for a love differing from all other love- the desire for a resting place and to be " all the world" to somebody.  And then Gertrude scolded herself for her want of proper sense of propriety in loving one who never had singled her out by one act of particular attention, though he was always kind in loving a rich 6   62    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. voice, a handsome face, and a careless, happy disposition, without reference to the mental or moral qualities, of which, in fact, she had never thought. It was time to put an end to all such unprofitable fancies, and she determined that she would if she could: at any rate, she would indulge in no more dreams; she would give her- self no time for thought, and hoped, by constant occupation, to ease or stifle the aching of the heart. Just as she reached this point in her meditations, the voices of Helen and Montrose arose front the door-step, where he and one of the other visitors were saying good-night; she heard him say, as he walklied away, " tell Gerty, mother wants to see her, if she cain come clown in the morning." Then she saw them  move down the street, and when they were hid in the darkness she rose from her knees at the win- dow, and began to prepare for bed; but, when she knelt to say her prayers, a feeling of desola- tion seemed to come over her, and burying her face in her hands she indulged in the luxury of a good cry. The next morning there was no sign of the struggle in her face. When she descended to the breakfast table she was quiet and attentive to   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     63 the wants of others as usual. Helen gave her Mrs. Beresford's message with no change of color or conscious look at the mention of Mon- trose's name; nor did she allude by word or look, or show any anxiety about the report Gertrude had to make in regard to the inter- view with her father, who seemed weary and fatigued when he came into the room, but gave his daughters his usual affectionate greeting. Gertrude couldl- not help wondering at her calmness; but then Helen had a certain calm composure about her at all times, as if the or- dinary affairs of life were so far beneath her as no more to ruffle the even surface of her exis- tence, than do the rough and jagged rocks, some- times lying at the bottom of a smooth fair lake, seem to disturb the calm waters above them. As soon as her father had gone, Helen told the girl -she would help Miss Gerty put away the breakfast dishes; to leave them alone. As soon as the girl was gone, she asked for Ger- trude's news, but Gertrude shook her head. '"My dear Helen, papa settled the matter very quickly; he will not give his consent, nor does he wish you to speak to him on the sub- ject."   "    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "Was that all, Gerty?" "Yes, pretty much!" "And did you say nothing to help me?" "Yes, I told him I thought it was a matter of conviction and deep religious feeling, not a mere fancy, as he said it was, but then you know Protestants think it so terrible to become a Religious, and papa is so proud of you, Helen." "Oh, if he would only let me talk to him!" ' He said, very decidedly, he wished to hear nothing about it; but, of course, if he finds you are set upon it, and that your happiness depends on that life, he may change his mind." "He may, and if he does not, I must wait and hope," said Helen. After a moment's silence, she asked Gertrude if she was going to see Mrs. ]Beresford? "Yes, as soon as I get through here." "How papa would miss you, Dame Burden, if you wanted to go, while I am of no more use than are those sevres vases on the parlor mantle," exclaimed Helen, kissing her sister. If you want company I will go with you as far as St. Joseph's Church: I want to see Father Arnoth."   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     65 i' I am sorry I could not do more for you,-I know it is a great trial." "Don't trouble yourself, Dame Durden, it will all come right in time--meanwhile, I will hope, pray and trust," replied Helen, as she left the room. Mrs. Beresford wanted to see Gertrude about some arrangements for her baptism, which was to take place in a week's time. "Does Montrose know of your intention?" asked Gertrude. "Oh, yes! it makes no difference to him, so I am happy. I hope after he begins to think seriously he will join me; at present he sees no necessity for religion," replied Mrs. Beresford. "What do you think of confession now, cousin Margaret; is it such a terrible thing?" "Oh, no! What a great, great comfort it is, Gertrude; why I could never have imagined such relief; do you know I felt as light-lhearted as a child after it. I made what the Bishop called a general confession, and I am to finish it to-morrow; but how is Helen? I have not seen her since the day we spent on the Nissa- hickon. Could you go out there with me to- morrow?"   "    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "Certainly; did the first visit please you so?" "Yes, indeed; it is so peaceful and lovely, and the city is so full of this August dust and sun."5 "Very well, we will go. Helen told me to wait for her here; she stopped at St. Joseph's to see Father Arnoth. and will join me here." ' Helen is a study to ilme, Gertrude; so beau- tiful' as she is, and so caressed in society, and, yet so indifferent to it all--it is quite a mystery to me, for she has not your love of books, or habits of study, and from what I have seen, you are the housekeeper at home." "Very few people do   understantd Helen, cousin Margaret, and I must confess she is sometimes a puzzle to me; as you say, she is not very fond of books, and the ornamental part of housekeeping is the only part that pleases her -still, Helen neglects no duty; if I am unable to do as usual, or very busy, she takes my place cheerfully, or does her share, though I must confess, not con asmore. But Helen is very de- vout, and has a pure love of her religion, and, cousin Margaret, I will tell you a secret that need be kept no longer: Helen wishes to become a Sister of Charity."   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     67 "Helen a Sister of Charity! You do sur- prise me--with all her beauty and youth----" "Ah, cousin, there spoke the Protestant heaviness, I fear, not the Catholic leaven, in your heart." "Perhaps so; but it is a strange fancy; I cannot understand that Helen should be willing to give up all social advantages so willingly." "I know   how you look upon it-no out- siders can understand what a vocation to a Re- ligious life is; few converts look upon it with favor till they have fully imbibed the spirit of the Church." -"It seems to me a cruel thing to be cut off from all enjoyment, bound down by strict rules to walk in a certain path and never deviate from it-to spend all your time in silence and prayer; to know nothing of even harmless amusements, that certainly can be no sin." "Oh, cousin Margaret, how little you know about it; why, there could not be found a mer- rier set than the Sisters are in recreation; they take walks together, have their gardens to at- tend to, and read pleasant books--pretty much as we do, only, of course, they are more restrained by rules and sometimes their duties are very   68    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. arduous.

Do you renlmember the young man St. Matthew tells about, who asked our Lord what he should do to have life everlasting, besides keep- ing the commandments? And the answer was, ' Go sell what thou hast and give to the poor, and come follow me.'" "You are an eloquent apologist, Gertrude, and almost persuade me to think as you do; but Helen is the last one I would have imagined willing to take such a life upon her, and it seems to me it is one little suited to her dis- position-one of perpetual and severe exertion," said Mrs. Beresford. "So it appeared to me; but Helen is firm in her purpose if she can only get papa to consent." "Ah, that will be difficult, I should think." "Yes; at present he will not have the sub- ject mentioned before him." "Poor Helen! if, indeed, her heart is set on it; and" she added to herself, c' poor Montrose!"

She looked little like an embryo Sister of Charity, in her delicate lilac muslin, white mantle, and white tulle bonnet, so beautiful and beaming. The dress was simple, but everything Helen put on had an air about it that changed the plainest fabric into something seeminglyl fit for an Em- press' She greeted her cousin warmly and entered into the plan for the proposed excursion with pleasure, although secretly dreading that Montrose would be of the party. This doubt was set at rest, however, by his mother, who said: "Our party will be a trio this time, instead of a quartette, for Montrose will not be able to go with us." After a little longer chat, the girls rose to go, and Helen warmly congratulated her cousin on the happiness she was about to experience so soon. and so they parted.   70     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CFT A P'TER X. "Hope is love's staff; walk hence with that, And manage it against despairing thoughts." g[tOOR Montrose! we have, I fear, treated Jl^ I him a little cavalierly, giving him the part of-what, in theatrical parlance, would be called--"the walking gentleman," and-not making any attempt to analyse or portray the feelings to which his actions and disappointments have given rise. He had said nothing to his mother of Helen's refusal of him; to tell the truth, it did not interfere with his appetite or sleep after the first day; naturally of a bright and cheerful disposition, he allowed himself to rest with hope on Heleln's promise to wait till the 12th of November. Andthe hope soon grew   into certainty that the "Montarges' legacy" of   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     71 4,000,000, was, in some way, mixed up with his future fortunes, and that Helen would be unable to resist the temptations laid before her, when that strange family document was opened. So, after one gloomy day spent in his room --in which he consumed a great miany cigars, and, I fear, vented a great many wishes not kindly to the order of St. Vincent, or religious orders in general-he was as cheerful as ever, and really, after a time, deceived his mother into an idea that his fancy, not his heart, had been caught by Helen's beauty. This hope or expectation in regard to the revelation to be made on the 12th of Novem-     I ber, affected his business habits also; and although  too honest to neglect any duty, imperative on him as a duty, he did no more, and showed no desire to master the details of the business: this troubled Mr. Wharton: for his interest in the young man was great, and he knew  nothing of the legacy, which, like a will-o'-the-wisp, ever danced before his protege's eyes. But for Mrs. Beresford's sake, he said nothing to him or her, and patiently waited-J knowing the sterling goodness of Montrose's character-for things to "right themselves." t   72    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. The day fixed for Mrs. Beresford's baptism was a lovely clear one, and, after the ceremony, they started for their favorite haunt. cI am  so glad we could come out here to-day; for, in my present state of feeling, the close heat, noise and turmoil of the city would have been insupportable; and here everything is so fresh and beautiful, just as God made it, with none of man's marring!" exclaimed Mrs. Beresford, as they once more found themselves under the grand old trees. Their talk was very quiet and subdued, on themes suggested by the happiness Mrs. Beres- ford had experienced that morning, and by Helen's calm, quiet satisfaction. "And you, my dear Helen," said the elder lady, "have chosen the better part: may it never be taken from you!" "Thanks, Cousin Margaret!" replied Helen; "and my probation is not to be as long as I feared. Papa called me into the library last night, and told me that he had been thinking over the matter, and that, much as it distressed and disappointed him, he would not stand in the way of my happiness. Dear, kind Papa!-was he not good?"   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     73 ' Tell me, Helen, have you no misgivings as to this life you are going to begin?" "None that I do not trust God's grace will remove; that He will give me strength to do His will, is my constant prayer." "Gertrude," said Helen, as, after parting with their cousin, the girls were ag'ain alone on their way home, "what canI the 12th of November have to do with me or my fortunes, that both Papa and-and Montrose should have asked me to wait for it?" "I am as much in the darlk as you are, and see nothing for us to do but to wait till the day comes--meanwhile to possess our souls in pa- tience," replied the matter-of-fact Gertrude. The next Sunday, Mrs. Beresford was to make her first communion, and Helen and Gertrude received with her-lFather Arnoth saying the mass. The Beresfords dined with their cousins, and went with them to the cath- edral vespers. "How does it happen, Gerty," said Mrs. Beresford, after dinner, "that you; and your manoy friends among the clergy have not con- verted your father?" "Oh, Papa is one of the hardest cases to 7   74    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. move!  He has no prejudices against the church, but he does not see the necessity of any revealed religion: he thinks if a man keeps the commandments, it is all that is necessary." "Does it not trouble you?" "Yes, very much-and I hope, before long he will change; but at present there is nothing to work on: so I see no way of making a beginning," , O34lH    TIE MONTARGES LEGACY.       75 CH APTER XI. "This accident and flood of fortune, So far exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust." ^imo the summner passed quietly and with no Amk disturbance of the usual routine; and so also passed the lovely October weather, when nature lays her brightest and richest colors on her pallet; only the frequent walks with Mon- trose were not so frequent, but the girls often went with their cousin Margaret to their fiavov- ite stream  and whiled  away  many a soft sun- ny hour in pleasant converse. After the first awkardness was over, Montrose returned to al- most his same footing with the girls; the onily difference was that Helen allowed no more tete- a-tetes, nor would she follow up any conversa-   76    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. ion that threatened to lead to subjects other than she would discuss with any visitor. Thus "time and the hour run through the days" and brought the momentous twelfth of November. How strange it is to look back upon some hour in our life that has changed its whole tenor, and remember with what calm unconcern we saw the moments slipping by, till that supreme one arrived from which we were to date a new existence. Frorm that time life takes a new aspect, utterly different from all that had gone before: thoughts and feelings are so utterly changed that we hardly believe our own identity-and yet one short hour before! On the afternoon of the day, the two families were in Mr. Montarges' library, only waiting the coming of Mr. Macgregor--Mr. Aontarges' lawyer--to open the mysterious letters. "And you think this fortune is left to us, papa?" asked Helen leaning over the back of her father's chair. "I have not formied an opinion on the subject, my child, and in order to avoid all speculation and anxiety in the matter, I did not allow you nor your sister to know anything about it."   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      " "You had a poor opinion of our patience, papa," said Gertrude. "Nro, not that, but I wished to spare you the unsettled feeling that I confess to have had my- self sometimes." "You were right I thnk, Ronald," said Mrs. Beresford, "if I had only been able to keep it a secret frolm Montrose, it would have been the better for himn." "Yes,"- but Montrose was interrupted by the announcement of Mr. Macgregor. Mr. Macgregor was rather a young looking man for his age; wearing a sandy colored scratch to conceal his partial baldness, and wonderfully natural looking teeth, dazzlinglfy white and even, which teeth were fully display- ed when he spoke, beneath a sandy moustache that developed into English whiskers. His figure was tall and thin, and when he bowed, bent in the middle, as if the only joint he had in his, body was that which enabled him to sit down. After the regulation bow to each of the ladies, a patronizing shake of Montrose's hand and a few whispered words to Helen, before whose beauty he, with many others, had succumbed, he turned to Mr. Montarges with the air of a   78     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. man who, having performed- one duty, was ready to turn to another, if it was set him. At last the important letters were opened, and amid breathless silence. The sum total, to which the accrued interest of the hundred years had swelled the original, was to be divided into two parts; each of these two parts was to be settled on the youngest child of the oldest mem- ber of each family, that is, the oldest member having children, on the day of her or his reach- ing the age of twenty-one, provided they had not attained that age, in which case they came into immediate possession, otherwise their parents had the full control of the income un- til they attained that age. If these two youngest members of the two families were both boys or both girls there were no condi- tions attached to the inheritance; but if they were boy and girl, or man and woman, and, un- married at the time of opening the letter, they could not receive a penny unless they married; if yet strangers to each other, six months were given them to make each others acquaintance, and the marriage must be consumated within the year-if they already knew each other the marriage must take place at the end of six   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     79 months, and they must make up their minds about it in three months. If either or both par- ties refused to comply with these conditions the fortune was to be devoted to charitable pur- poses, and not one penny was to go to the family. "Such are the contents of both papers, ladies and gentlemen, and such the singular arrange- ment made by your common ancestor, thanks to which I have the honor to informl you, Miss Gertrude, and you Mr. Montrose, that it rests with yourselves whether you will become the possessors of the neat little sum of twenty mil- lions of dollars!" At first Gertrude did not take in the full idea, but when the lawyer put it so plainly before her, there was no mistaking; poor Gerty gave an   hysterical laugh and fainted; her sister and  cousin ran to her assistance, while Mr. Montarges stood helpless, as men always are in such a  crisis, looking anxiously at his child.  Montrose turned with folded arms and gloomy  brow to the window where he stood, looking down   into the street, but seeing or hearing nothing. lMr.- Macgregor slipped quietly away, feeling it was a time when no stranger's presence would be pleasant.   80    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "Help me, papa, to get Gerty into your room," said Helen, opening the door between it and the library. Thankful for somletlhing to do, Mr. Montarges complied, but Montrose never moved, nor did he change his position till, some fifteen mninutes afterwards, lMr. Mon- targes laid his hand on the young man's arm, and asked him to hurry to Dr. Minturn's, as Gertrude Eaad gone from one fainting fit into another, and could not be roused. After re- questing the doctor, whom he fortunately found just stepping into his buggy, to call at his cousins, poor Montrose continued his walk down Walnut Street, not very well knowing what he was doing or where he was going. The hours passed, and the early darkness falling, the flash of a street lamp right in his face as he passed it, reminded him that, unless his mother had left before dark, she would need his escort home, and induced him to turn his steps towards Rittenhouse Square. Mrs. Beresford spoke to him a few moments in the hall, and told him that as Gertrude still seemed nervous and ill, she could not think of leaving her and Helen alone that night. Mr. Montarges had requested her to invite Mon-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     81 trose to remain to tea with him; this Montrose refused, and, bidding his mother good-night, returned to his own room. But sleep was a stranger to his eyes, and he sat the whole night, smoking one cigar after     I another, till the sky grew gray in the early dawn, and then, throwing himself, dressed as he was, on his bed, he fell into a heavy sleep. Helen and Mrs. Beresford kept anxious watch beside Gertrude, and Mr. Montarges spent the night in the library, ready to call the doctor at the slightest need.  Dr. Minturn did not leave till, very late, he saw  the composing draught he had given had taken effect, and told them   to send for him if she awoke and was at all unlike herself. But she was quite quiet after that, and in the morning awoke relieved. At first she was confused at not being in her own  room, and at the anxious faces bending    \ over her, but presently the recollection of the previous day came  to her, and turning away from her cousin and sister, she buried her face in the pillows. "Gerty darling," said Helen, bending over her, won't you speak to me? it's Helen, and lere are cousin Margaret and papa, too."  But   82     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Gertrude only shook her head and made no reply. "Don't talk to her, Helen; let us leave her to get a little more sleep," said Mrs. Beresford. So they left her, and Mrs. Beresford rested for a while in Helen's room. Meantime Gertrude, left to herself, lay some time in the same position, then she sat up, but her head swam so, she was glad to rest it on the pillow again. She lay there quietly, and one prayer after another arose in her heart for strength in the trial that was before her, and guidance in the right way. After his breakfast, her father came up to the room, and finding her awale, stooped over her affectionately and kissed her, saying le hoped to find his precious "Dame Durden" all herself by evening. A little longer rest, and Gertrude was able to raise her head from the pillow, and gradually to dress herself. She drank eagerly the cup of coffee Helen sent her, and insisted that she was perfectly well again. Nothing was said through the day on the sunbject of the legacy, and after dinner Mrs. Beresford returned to her boarding-house.

Mr. Macgregor left a bouquet  of choice hot- house flowers for Miss Gertrude, with his com- pliments, and hopes that her indisposition would not be a long one. Helen smiled when Margaret, with a beaming face presented the bouquet and the message. "Ah, Gerty, my star has forever set with Mr. Macgregor, I fear, and yours arisen, like a meteor, to the very zenith ;" but seeing a pain- ful expression on  Gertrude's face, she was silent, and busied herself arranging the flowers. During the imorning Gertrude had written to Father Arnoth to come and see her, but as he did not get the letter till late that evening, he was obliged to put off his visit till the next day. They had a long conference on the sub- ject, and at the end of it poor Gerty felt almost as troubled as before, but she trusted that as everything was ordered by a kind Providence, He would bring all right in His own time.   84     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CTT APTER -XLI. "Farewell to the few I leave with regret."  fwo weeks passed, before Gertrude would allow a word before her on the subject of the legacy; Montrose-though his visits were not as frequent as before-called several times, baut Gertrude would not see him, and Helen excused herself several times. In Mrs. Beresford's society, however, Gertrude seemed to find much pleasure; a warm friend- ship and intimacy had grown up between these two--in spite of their different ages that would require much to destroy it. A week after the 12th of November, Helen sought an interview with her father, and re- minded him of his promise to allow her to carry out her intention, if the secret of that day did not alter it. It had not, she told him;   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    85 on the contrary, she was anxious to begin her new life. Mr. Montarges used every effort to induce her to change her mind in vain, and, with sad reluctance, was at last obliged to give his consent. She immediately began her prepa- rations, and bade farewell to her friends. The night before they parted, the sisters had a long, long talk over past, present, and probable future. Then, for the first time, Gertrude spoke t" on the subject of the legacy, and of the horror with which she thought of the care and trouble such a fortune brought with it, and how glad she was it could never be hers. "Never be yours! Gerty, you don't mean to say you will refuse such a legacy?" "Remember the conditions, Helen: how can I do other than refuse it? Montrose does not love me, and-and would be too honorable to marry me without loving me; and H don't -well, I don't want the money: Papa gives me all I want. I have not a wish in the world ungratified  " here Gertrude paused ab- ruptly: for she remembered the one wish of her heart- that was ungratified, which, had it been, would have cut this terrible Gordian knot so easily! 8   86    TIIE MONTARGES LEGACY. 'lMy dear Gerty, let Montrose have a fair chance to klnow you; don't keep so much in the background, and trust me-cay unfortunate face out of the way-it will not be long before he will learn to love you, as every one must who knows you; try to love him a little, Gerty: you don't seem now to care much for his society, and he feels it, I think." "Try to love him!"   The words lifted a great fear off Gertrude's heart: she felt her secret was safe, and if Helen--ler daily and hourly companion--had not discovered it, cer- tainly no one else could. C Remembler, too, Dame Durden, the power so much money will give you for doing good; don't you know how often you wished you had a hundred dollars, to give Mrs. WNarren, when Sarahl was sick; and now you will have thous- ands, in place of hundreds. Just think, dear, how much you willbe able to do!" "Oh, Helen, Helen! why cannot I wear the serge, and you the diamonds?" was all Ger- trude's answer, as she threw herself on her knees, and buried her face in her sister's lap. The next day, Helen left her home; some of the sisters were returning to the Mother House,   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     87 and she accompanied them. Gertrude wished to go with her, but Helen preferred going alone. "The parting," she said, "would be none the less painful, that it was put off for another week or so."   Mrs. Beresford and Montrose saw  her the evening before, and  bade her "good bye;" the latter was very quiet, but otherwise gave no expression to his feelings. Gertrude could not be induced to see him, making an excuse that she was busied in some last arrangements for Helen. For some time after her departure, the house was very silent and lonely; they missed her sadly. Gertrude doubly so: for she was left alone to fight a  hard battle, with no one to whom  she could  eonfide her mauy troubled thoughts, as she could do to a sister. HHelen's dear five hundred friends began to give as many -reasons for her going.  Among the mlLany, was one that seemed the most probable: she was chagrined that the legacy was not to fall to her, and  at the loss of her lover; for that Montrose would have been refused by Helen, seemed never to have been thought of; young, so very handsome, and probably the heir of the wealthy bachelor, his patron. Some of these   88    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. whispers reached Gertrude's ear; but she ex- pected them, and they did not trouble her. A few evenings after Helen's departure, Ger- trude was called to the door to speak to a poor woman; the night was not very cold, and; being bright moonlight, she stood on the steps a moment after the woman left her, attracted by the beauty of the scene. As she stood there a gentleman approached and, throwing away his cigar came up the steps; then, for the first time since that eventful day, Gertrude and Montrose stood face to face.  Under a calm "good evening" she hid the tumult of feeling that surged in her heart, and in bid- ding him enter, there was not a tremor in her voice. It was a very stupid visit: for neither could bear to speak of Helen's departure, and, though both felt the absence of her bright face and sweet, merry voice, her name was not mentioned; the object uppermost in their thoughts with Helen the legacy, was, of course, too delicate a subject; and so, after making conversation of various and minor ones, a silence fell upon them, which grew more and more embarrassing, till Montrose asked Gertrude to play something for him.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     89 She readily assented; and he, after opening the instrument, returned to the sofa where he had been lounging, and was soon oblivious to all around him, wrapt in thought. She played several of Mendelsohn's , "Lieder ohne Worte," when, overcome by the memory of what had passed since she had played them last, poor little Gertrude buried her face in her hands, and sobbed aloud. This drew Montrose out of his dreams; he started up, exclaiming: ," Gertrude, what's the matter?" and approaching her, laid his hand on her arm; this only brought the tears faster; and, muttering something about "not knowing what to do when women cried," he beat an ignominious retreat, and left the house. The evening of the thirteenth of November, when Mrs. Beresford returne( to her boarding- house, after seeing Gertrude quite herself again, she had sought her son's room immediately after tea. On entering, she dimly discerned the form she sought enveloped in cigar smoke, out of which however he sprang on seeing who it was, to offer his mother a chair; Mrs. Beresford seated herself and Montrose smoked On in silence. At last the mother spoke:   90    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "Well, Montrose, the twelfth of November has come and gone!" "Yes; mother, it's come and gone," echoed her son, throwing his cigar into the fire. " And brought you a splendid fortune.'? "Brought me a splendid- fortune;" again he echoed her words, but very sarcastically. "I should consider ten millions a neat sum." "Good heavens, mother, are you mocking me?" "By no means, my son; when did I ever mock you?" "( It sounds infernally like it!" "Very well, then I will leave you!" His mother rose as she spoke, but in an in- stant Montrose was at her side; his arm around her. "Forgive me, dear mother, you do not know how much this strange legacy has worried and troubled me, and how much I now wish that the day had never come; but mother, darling, never, never let the c  , miserable money come between you and me. You are all I have in the world, I will do anything you wish, any- thing I can, to make you happy." "' My dear boy," said Mrs. Beresford, drawing   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      91 his face down to hers and kissing it-"-my dear boy, you are very foolish to worry about this; do exactly as your conscience dictates; don't let any thought of me or my comfort in- fluence you, for my wants are moderate and easily gratified, only," she added with a smile, "I don't think the conditions so very hard to fulfil, and twenty millions is a large sum to cast away; so think of the matter seriously-next twelfth of February you will be twenty-one." "I know, I know; but it can only be mine on condition of marrying an ugly stupid girl, who hasn't two ideas in her brain, or two words to speak them in!" "Oh, how   unkind; unjust, Montrose; you know  it.  Gertrude Montarges lacks grace of form and beauty of face, perhaps, though to me she is often handsome; but the other charge --there are few young girls better informed ' than she, and if she is silent it is only because you have never taken the trouble to draw her out!" ' Well, grant her to be Minerva in disguise; I don't love her-shall I perjure myself for twenty millions?"   92      THE MONTARGES LEGACY. ' Not for one penny;" exclaimed his mother, "I only ask you to know your cousin better before you judge her, and, knowing her, you cannot help loving her." "She took the matter so hard, how do I know but it may essentially interfere with her own arrangements-it looks like it!" ' Hlow do you mean, Montrose?" "How do I know but that she has an in- superable objection in the form of a previous en- gagement?" "I don't think she has-judging from what I have seen, I think Gertrude is heart and fancy free." "A great pity, that's all," muttered Mon- trose to himself. "But I will never say anything more on the matter, it is one you must settle for your- self;-only give Gertrude a fair chance; let her know you ; and study her yourself--and now, good-ni ght." The fond mother pushed back the clustering curls from her sons fair forehead and imprinting a kiss there, left the room. "The dear old mother;" exclaimed Montrose as soon as he was alone, (Mrs. IBeresford was just forty-one,) "bless her--wouldn't I love to   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      93 make her the mistress of a palace! iBut bah!

T wo or three days after Montrose's visit, Mr. Montarges called Gertrude into the library. The interview lasted a long time, and when Gertrude came out of the room she had a look of haggard misery on her face, painful in one so young. She went right up to her own room, and, laying her head wearily down on the pillow, remained in the one position for more than an hour. Mr. Montarges had never brought any of his business troubles home to his daughters, and they never knew or th6ught anything about them. This day he asked Gertrude, abruptly, if Montrose had ever mentioned 'I the subject of the legacy, and the accompanying conditions?"   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    95 "No, papa ; I have only seen Montrose once," replied Gertrude, clasping both hands over her heart. "Why?" "Because, Gertrude, this is the 2d of De- cember, nearly one month of the three has gone and, it seems, been wasted." "Papa, papa, the money can never be mine," cried poor Gertrude, with such a look of misery in her face that her father put his arms around her and drew her down upon his knee, saying, kindly, 4" why are you so certain of that?" "Because Montrose does not wish it; he does not love me, and I " "You are not attached to any one else?" he asked hurriedly. Gertrude shook her head in the negative. "Then Montrose not loving you is a small matter; he can learn the art, and not find it a very difficult one, either, and you can learn it also, my dear." '"Oh, papa, please don't say anything about it-please!" "Only this, Gertrude, and then I am done: unless I  have the prospect of only such aid as that legacy can give, by the first of January 1860, I  will be a ruined man; there is a storm   96    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. brewing over the country, which at present looks to the general public like a mere war of words in the Senate and House; but merchants feel these things more keenly, and I know it will be something more serious; and my failure, if it comes, will only be the precursoriof many others. Slavery and freedom are coming to the death-grapple; I may not live to see the end, but the beginning is not far off:" "Papa, what can I do?" "Promise me this: that if Montrose offers himself you will not reject him. That he will not be willing to lose the large fortune I feel sure; and as for loving or not loving each other, my dear girl, remember the many, many marriages we see for money, and money alone taking place daily around us; and how many turn out much happier matches than the des- perate love affairs we hear of. Do not misun- derstand me, my child; if you loved any one else, or I thought Montrose did, I would not have a word to say in the matter, for I have but one thought, and that is for your happi- ness; all I ask is, that you will not reject any offer your cousin makes ; try to love him ; it is not a difficult task, for he is young, handsome,   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     97 and in every way worthy of your affection; let him know you better, and there is no danger but that very soon he will learn to love you." Gertrude could make no answer to her father's worldly reasoning, though her thoughts were very busy as she rose from his knee and walked to the library window. "You see, Gertrude," continued her father, "half of the twenty millions is yours, settled on yourself, not to be touched by your husband, or any one. How old are you now?" he asked suddenly. "I will be eighteen the 12th of February next," replied Gertrude in a low voice, as she leaned her forehead down on one of the d-ivi- sions of the window panes. "A h, then there are three years during which I will have the control of the interest, and those three years are just the time I want." Gertrude turned and looked at her father in sad surprise. Had this sudden threatening of fortune changed his nature, for never in her life before had she heard him speak in such a tone? Was the heart she had hitherto thought so pure only base metal after all? Her father saw the look, and a feeling of 9   98    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. regret that he should have lowered himself for one moment in the eyes of his child made -hirn avoid her gaze, while he pretended to be look- ing for something among the papers on the table. "Papa,"--Gertrude's voice was low, and trembled-"Papa, I promise what you wish on one condition." "Well, Gertrude, what is it?"  "That you will give up business as soon as you can." "My child!" "It would not be right that you should con- tinue to worry and work while I have more than I know what to do with." "No, Gertrude, I cannot promise any thing of the kind ; I see that you have misunderstood me this morning, and a business engagement prevents my remaining to explain. Only one word, my daughter: That escutcheon (point- ing to the coat of arms hanging over the mantle) has been borne by honest men and true since the days of the NWars of the Roses, and there has never been a stain of dishonor upon it; do you think the heart of the American merchant is less proud, less keenly aliv to the   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     99 honor of his house than were the plumed and helmetted knights who were his ances- tors? I have borne an unblemished name for honesty and probity ever since I began busi- ness; now, my good name is at stake, not through any fault of mine, and if a failure comes it will sweep every penny from my purse, as well as dim that shield for the first time, for men will not believe that it has been my mis- fortune to trust a rascal!

The use I would make of your money, or the small portion of the income I would need, would be no disadvantage to it, and would be returned, principal and interest, before you missed it. So, remember what I say, and think on it." With these words, Mr. Montarges opened the library door, and Gertrude, like one in a dream, walkeed out and up stairs to her own room. Near mid-day an exquisite basket of flowers was left at the door, with Mr. Macgregor's compliments; the girl brought it up to Ger-   100    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. trude's room, and this was the first thing that roused her. 'With a weary smile she tossed aside the card, and, taking the basket down to the parlor, placed it on a small table that stood under a beautiful painting of the Mother and Child. "Mother, most sorrowful, pray for me!'" said Gertrude, and, as she bent over the flowers, hot tears fell upon their petals, and sank among their leaves. "Miss Gerty, please don't you want some lunch; a cup of tea would do your head good, may be!" Gertrude started, not having remembered that Margaret followed her. "No, Margaret," she replied, "I don't want any thing, but," glancing, at her disordered dress, "I must malke a change in my toilet be- fore there is a chance of visitors."  She mounted again to her room, and stood for a moment before the glass ere she began to dress: "Oh,   Gertrude, Gertrude," she said, half aloud, "why have you not one little portion of your sister's beauty! Oh, for one tithe of Helen's power to win the love I want to make me happy!" When Mr. Montarges came in to dinner   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     101 { r  Gertrude ran down to the library, and, throw- ing her arms around her father, sobbed out: "I will do as you wish, papa, only love me, only love me!"

CH APTER- XIV. "Love is not in our power; Nay!-what seems stralnger-is not in our choice." LETTERS came from Helen, full of happiness in her new life; and those to Gertrude expressing the warmest and tenderest interest in her affairs. It was the week before Christmas, and Meon- trose's visits had been frequent, but short; he acted like a person with something distressing his mind.  He and his mother had   never spoken again on the subject of the legacy, and, of course, it was not mentioned by Mrs. Beres-      ford to Gertrude; but from Gertrude's sad face I     and uneasy manner, Montrose wa's more and more convinced that her affections were en- gaged in another quarter. He had still retained his clerkship with Mr. Wharton, but still less   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     103 than ever was his heart and mind in the busi- ness; Helen's name was never mentioned.' Meanwhile, Mr. Montarges waited    and watched most anxiously. Fortunately, as the first of January was barely two weeks off, he had not to wait long. One day Gertrude went down, after dinner, to see Mrs. Beresford, intending, if the twilight did not last long enough, to ride up in the Walnut Street cars. She stopped at St. Jo- seph's Church to see Father Arnoth for a few moments, then went to her cousin's -boarding- house. To her surprise she found Mrs. Beres- ford very ill; Montrose had been up a night or two before, and said his mother was not feeling very well, but Gertrude thought it was but a, however, and Gertrude iound her in a high fever, and Montrose just about to start for her; so she pencilled a note to her father, saying she would not be home that night, and why, and a few lines to Marigaret, telling her what articles to put iinto a satchel that her cousin could bring to her. The next day Mr. Montarges called; but Mrs. Beresford was still too ill for Gertrude to leave her; and so she was for   104    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. three or four days. On the evening of the fifth day, she insisted upon Gertrude's returning home and getting a good night's rest. During her stay with his mother, of course, Montrose saw a great deal more of Gertrude than he ever had before, and he could not help admiring the tender devotion she showed, and the care she took of her patient; indeed, Dr. Minturn told him, it was owing more to Gertrude's nursing, than to his medicines, that his mother had not had a long and serious illness. This evening it was late before Gertrude could leave, after see- ing Mrs. Beresford comfortable for the night, and Montrose insisted upon getting a carriage, as the walk to the cars was a long one. He went for one, and, as soon as she heard it draw up, she began putting on her wrappings; then, leaning over her cousin, she bade her "good night," and hoped she would be ever so much better the next day. "My dear Gertrude, my darling child!" said Mrs. Beresford, "how great a boon it would have been if Heaven had given me a daughter like you; but," she added, smiling, "you can, if you will, be my daughter yet: will you not?"   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    105 ':Hush!" said Gertrude; for there, holding the door partly openl, was Montrose, showing by his face, that he had heard his mother's words. Gertrude repeated her'"'good night," and then walked out of the room  without looking up, being intent on drawing on her glove. "I hope cousin Margaret will continue to improve," she said, as they drove along. ' I hope so; we are under many obligations to you, Gertrude," was his answer. "Oh no!" replied she, hurriedly; "did she not--"  Then, remembering the cause of Mrs. Beresford's attention to herself, did not finish the sentence, and the drive was com- pleted in silence. WWhen they reached the house Montrose fol- lowed her into it, telling the driver to wait; it was late, and Gertrude very tired, and he could not stay long; but he had determined suddenly to "cast his fortune on the die, and win or lose it all." He had left a piece of music some weeks before, the flute part of a duett for flute and piano, and this he pre- tended to look for as he turned over the music; but after a few moments' search he gave it   106    THE MONTARGES LEGACY.  up, and turned to Gertrude very abruptly, saying: "Gertrude, there is something I want to say to you: will you listen to me? it is better to have this matter settled as soon as possible. I heard what my mother said to-night, and can only repeat her words: will you be her daughter?" Gertrude turned pale at the suddenness of the words, and looked questioningly up into his face. It was flushed; and his eyes were fixed upon hersbut with no tenderness in their gaze; his heavy curls fell over his forehead as he slightly bent his head. "Must I repeat my question?" he asked, taking her hand. "No," said Gertrude, quietly; "I heard you." "And your answer?" She made no reply, only turned away her face, that he might not see the agony written there. '"I cannot read your silence, Gertrude." There was not a tender inflection in his clear, cold--voice; 'CI will!" The words were so low he was hardly sure he heard them, but he said:   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    107 "Ah! then it will make my mother very happy-;" and, stooping down, pressed his lips to her hand. "I know you are tired now, so I will not detain you longer, but say good night." He dropped her hand, and turned to the door;    X as he turned again to repeat his "good night," Gertrude raised her eyes to his face in a long, fixed gaze.' "Good night," she said; but her   I voice did not sound like her own, either to herself or Montrose. He closed the door, how- ever, feeling that it was an awkward position   i either to go or stay; she heard him shut the    t front door and the carriage drive off; then she  :  rung the bell for the girl to close the house and I put out the gas, and, going up stairs, tapped at  i the library door. Her father told her to enter.;  0 and, going up to him, she-put her arm round'  his neck and said:                 I "How have you got along without me? have     l you missed me?"                  i "How could I do otherwise, Dame Durden?  but Margaret and Kate did very nicely."      j "Papa!' said the poor child, in a low voice,    "I have kept my promise, and you are safe,     I but don't talk about it;" and, kissing him, she   i ran from the room and up to her own sanctum.    l -   108    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Meantime, Montrose threw himself back in the carriage, and was driven home rapidly. "Poor girl!'" he thought; "the money has been too great a temptation, and she has thrown the other fellow over; but her heart is not in it --her heart is not in it!"It did not seem to enter his mind that it mattered whether his own heart was in it or not. "By Jove!" he exclaimed: '"what splendid eyes Gertrude has! I never noticed them before; but her face is so very plain; then her hair is magnificent: I wonder if it is all her own! I bet it is one-half or two-thirds the result of Jolivet's art. Well, the Madre will be satisfied: she has Gertrude for a daughter, and the for- tune; but bless the Madre's old heart, I don't think she cares a pin for the fortune, and ' she does love Gertrude very much." The next morning, when he went into his mother's room, he greeted her with an attempt at merriment, and told her he had "done for himself the night before, was regularly in for it." "What do you mean, Montrose?" she asked, anxiously. "Mean! why, that last night I asked Ger-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    109 trude Montarges to be your daughter, and, as she said 'yes,' she cannot become so without marrying me." "Molltrose!" ' AMother!" "Are you in earnest?" "Solemn, sober earnest." "Poor Gerty!" sighed Mrs. Beresford. "Humph! is that out of compliment to me?" "Oh, Montrose, how can you joke on such a subject?" "Well, dear, I will not joke any more; I have asked Gertrude to marry me, and she has accepted me in regular form; the fortune is ours, and your and Mr. Montarges' hearts are set at rest; and so good-bye." He kissed her, and left the room hastily; he said nothing of the sleepless night he had passed, or the package of Helen's notes and other treasures, laid one by one in the bed of Anthracite in his grate. Gertrude did not come down to breakfast; her night had been spent in tears and prayers for strength to do her duty. Her father went with a light heart to his counting-house. 10   "O    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER XV. "Cold duty's path is not so blithely trod." A  ow the merry Christmas times come and go!

That is Christmas picture number one. Look at that sad, careworn woman in black with the white widow's cap round her pale  face! see her hurrying home in the twilight of the Christmas eve, with her hands and arms full of bundles! watch the eager little faces flattened against the window panes, and listen to the patter of little feet rushing to the hall -door. ' Mamma, are we going to have a Christmas-tree?" Ain't Santa Claus coming  to-night?" "Mamma, Nelhe said we weren't to have any Christmas at all!"  Such is the chorus that greets her, while, with a gentle word to one, a caress to another, she makes her way into the parlor, her eyes fillingg with tears as she glances towards the corner, where, for so many years, each Christmas eve had found him busy with the arrangements of the tree. The busy little hands relieve her of her burdens, and then unfasten bonnet and cloak, a little awed by the tears that are stealing down her cheeks, till one tiny, wee thing comes close   "2    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. to her, and puts one little hand up, trying to reach her neck, and whispers, as she stoops to listen: "Won't Santa Claus bring papa back to-night?"The tears can no longer be checked, and, hastily drawing the baby into her arms, she gives them way. Afterwhile, the children are pacified by the fable that their mother had met Santa Claus in the street, and he had sent these toys to make up for the tree, and would fill their stockings to overflowing, and are taken off to bed. Then the mother draws her chair close to the glowing grate, and, while her tears flow unchecked, spends her Christmas eve in thinking of the lonely grave out there in the country, where a simple cross bears a name and date, standing in the fair moonlight -over the mound, where all her world lies buried. That is Christmas picture number two. Let us follow this poor creature a little way; see how the cold penetrates the thin shawl she draws closer and closer around her, while she stops and looks with eager, wide open, eyes at the various dainties set forth behind the plate- glass windows of the confectioner's shop, or the warm cloaks and beautiful shawls, and dress goods hanging to the best advantage under the    THE MONTARdES LEGACY.     113 gas lights of the dry goods store; see her turn away with a sigh, and slowly creep down some miserable alley-way into a court, where the dirt and misery is made just apparent by the dim lights in the different rooms opening into it. She goes to one of the doors and opens it; there is a rush of little feet to greet her too, bit the chorus is "Oh, I am so hungry, mother, so very hungry!"  Then she takes from  under her shawl a loaf-of bread, and breaks it up among the little ones, and tears blind her so, she hardly sees their ravenous devouring of it, nor does she notice, or seem to notice, the slouching figure that was sitting over the apology for a fire, and that now gets up and crawls towards the door, holding in the hand further from her a bottle; in a short time the children are asleep, and -she slips into each little worn-out shoe a candy figure, in which extravagance she had   ex- pended five cents that she could ill spare. But she thinks of the pleasure, in the morning, to those little creatures, who will feel that Santa Claus remembers the poor as well as the rich; and so, putting out the light and scattering the few coals on the hearth, (for she must economise after buying the candy,) she goes to bed to keep   "4    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. warm. But first she has fastened the door and piled chairs on the table in front of it, for she knows his carouse will last till morning, and he will be dangerous if let in, and so she spends her Christmas Eve, wondering how the bread for the next day is to be obtained. . But still the merry Christmas bells are rung out in the frosty morning air, regardless of what ears their sound falls upon. To Gertrude their music was inexpressibly sad: she missed Helen, and longed for her sister's company on that morning more than she had done since they were separated. She had seen her cousin Mar- garet several times since that eventful evening, and her sad, sore heart was somewhat comforted by her cousin's evidently sincere affection. Mr. Montarges had made arrangements that placed his business once more in a prosperous tide, and between him and Montrose it was decided that he and Mr. Macgregor should sail for Liverpool immediately after New Year's to secure the legacy. Montrose, being anxious on account of his mother, who was still far from  well, did not feel that he could leave her. It was settled that Mrs. Beresford was to remain with Gertrude, where she could be better taken   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     115 care of, in case she had another spell of sick- ness, and Gertrude would not be left alone. These arrangements were all made before Christmas, and on Christmas Eve Mrs. Beres- ford took possession of Helen's room. Gertrude suffered much during all these pre- parations; although she busied herself over the arrangements for her father's journey, she could not at times keep the hot tears back when she thought of the object of the journey, and of her instrumentality in the matter. She felt very much humiliated when she thought of that evening on which her fate had been de- cided ; not ,one word had Montrose said of love, or even respect and esteem, and there was not one little look or expression from which her aching heart could gather hope for better things afterwhile. tie had done it for his mother's sake, and because he felt he must not lose the money-nothing else, and the more Gertrude thought, the .more indignant she felt with herself for yielding--with him for asking. Then came the memory of what her father had told 'her, and that thought checked the half- formed intention to break the matter off, and be at rest again. Father Arnoth could only   "6     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. help her by telling her that her self-sacrifice would one day meet with its reward; that as she did her duty, so would comfort come.    To Helen she wrote, but letters, at best, are poor comfort, and particularly in this case, where a third, a stranger's, eye was to see them  before they reached her.  Two days after Christmas, Gertrude received a long letter fron Helen- "' MY DEAREST," she wrote, " your sad letter has given me much pain. Oh, my darling! could I only be there to speak to you-all I say in a letter must sound so cold! But bear up, Gerty, the future may have some great happi- ness in store for you.

Montrose had only paid his betrothed tNwo visits before his mother took up her abode with hler, and in those visits his manner had been that of discharging a duty, so Gertrude was glad that they were not more frequent. After Mrs. Beresford made one of the family he came oftener, but, to Gertrude's relief, the visits, owing to other callers, were never tcte-a- tetes. Macgregor still sent frequent baskets of flowers, and on Christmas Eve a beautifully bound volume of poems. Montrose's Christmas gift had been a beautiful parure of garnets, set with pearls, but he gave her no engagement ring. Poor Gertrude! her burden was almost more than she could bear; she tried to take comfort out of her father's perfect satisfaction and her cousin Margaret's love; but oh, strange human heart, what is all else, if the one boon is withheld!   "8    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CH APTER XVI. "The wildest ills that darken life Are rapture to the bosom's strife; The tempest in its blackest form Is beauty, to the bosom's storm." T parties and the opera, or whatever ^^   place of amusement she appeared, Mon- trose was Gertrude's attendant, and he was sufficiently polite to satisfy the general world, though those who knew, or guessed at his former attachments to Helen, pretended to perceive an air of ennui, a certain want of interest that seemed rather unlover like. One day during her father's absence, Gertrude, hav- ing written to Helen and having some shopping to do, went out. She had written her letter in the library and left her portefolio open on the table. Soon after Montrose came in and began turning over the leaves of the portefolio, when   THE MONTARGES LEG ACY.    119 suddenly he turned red, then pale, and fixed his eyes on the leaf before him. HHis first impulse was to tear it out, but he remembered that the book was not his own and refrained. Poor Gerty! in her haste she had not noticed that in pressing the letter on the blotting paper, she had left a very clear impress of part of it; the words Montrose read were: "Oh, my darling, how can I give you up?" " a sacrifice too great for my strength to bear." "Dearest, could I but see you, speak to you; I feel as if I must fly to you, only it would not be right." "So!" the word was a long one as Montrose breathed it, and turning on his heel he left the house. He was very angry, and accused Ger- trude of deceiving him and of marrying him only for the money; never pausing to remember that such was his case exactly, and that his proposal to Gertrude had, in its abruptness and the total want of the slightest profession of affection, a covert insult. So, in no pleasant frame of mind, he started down the street, and meeting some young men of his own age, who, like himself, had their time on their hands, (and who spent it making themselves nuisances to all true ladies who were obliged to be seen on Chestnut   120    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Street,) they invited him to go up to the Schuylkill and watch the skating; this he declined and hoped they would leave him, but they sauntered along, making remarks uplon the ladies whom they passed, till Montrose in disgust turned into Tenth Street and left them. Just ahead of him he saw Gertrude, and sud- denly made up his mind to speak to her and give her a last chance to free herself, if she wished it. He followed her home at a little distance, and she had hardly. taken off her wrappings before Margaret came to tell her that Mr. ]Beresford was in the parlor, and wished to speak with her a moment. "Ask him to come up into the library,?' said Gertrude, very much surprised at this unusual request. Margaret obeyed her, and as it was nearly dark, lighted the gas, which, as soon as slLe was gone Montrose, turned very low, then thllrew himself on the sofa. In a' few moments Gertrude made her appearance; as she entered the room, he rose and drew a chair forward for her, then stood resting against the mantle. Poor Gertrude tried to speak, but her throat was dry, and before she could articulate a word hetprevented her.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     121 "Gertrude," he had never since their engage- ment called her "Gerty" or "Dame Durden," the pet names he had caught from the rest,-it was always "Gertrude" in the full strength of every letter. "Gertrude, I am sorry to have disturbed, by requesting this interview, any more pleasant employment you may have been engaged in, but I have something to say, which I wish said, as soon as possible." "  Well?" queried Gertrude. "I wish you clearly to understand that what I say, is not on my own account; I am perfectly satisfied with the present arrangement, but I fear you are not; therefore, although it will be a great disappointment to your father, and will make his journey fruitless, I give you the oppor- tunity now of breaking your engagement with me, and letting matters return to their old footing; resting the blame on me when your father is told of it. Do you wish it?" Gertrude had listened in dumb amazement, and, after he ceased speaking, she still was silent for a few moments. In those few moments, the picture of her father's distress, and of all the many hopes and plans he had built upon this marriage, arose before her, and this thought "   122    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. gave her strength, though the impulse at first was to accept the relief thus offered. Rising, she pressed both hlands over her heart and man- aged to say: "I do not wish it!" "Am I to understand that you are perfectly satisfied to let matters remain as they are?" a I am." "Remember, Gertrude, this is the last time I will speak on the subject-are you sure?" "I am." She raised her lovely eyes to his face and gazed at him with a wild supplicating look, then with a cry, like some wounded ani- lmal, she flung her arms round him and sobbed: "Oh, Montrose, do you not see that my b heart is breaking.?" Astounded at this sudden display of emotion, and apparent contradiction, in the hitherto quiet and reserved Gertrude, Montrose disen- gaged himself from her embrace as gently as he could, and seated her on the sofa; he did not sit beside her and try to soothe her with gentle words, but stood waiting, with one arm resting on the mantle, for the sobbing to cease. i^ "My dear Gertrude, I must trouble you to explain yourself, for your last words were a. direct contradiction to your former ones," he   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    123 said, coldly, as soon as she grew more composed. "You are satisfied with things as they are, and yet your heart is breaking!" She looked up at him again, and noticed the extreme beauty of his face, as the firelight played over his features, while he bent his head down to his hand resting on the mantle. A wild pang shot through her heart; a wild feeling of despair, and almost of hatrgd of this cold statue, upon whose calmness no agony of hers could make the least imapression. She said: "Forget the last wild words, :M\ontrose; I repeat, I am perfectly satisfied." ' This is your final answer?" "Y Yes, this is my final answer, and now I must beg you to leave me." Shall I not call my mother?" he asked, seeing she turned pale. "No; I beg of you; only leave me." And so, glad to escape, he did. "Strange, unaccountable girl," he said to himself. "Well, I have done my part, and now, ' come he slow or come he fast, it is but fate that comes at last.'"

Montrose was acting a most unnatural part just now--unnatural, I mean, to his heart and feelings. Had Helen returned his love, no brother could have been more devoted in the affection he would have shown Gertrude, for he had liked her very much when he first knew the sisters, and often wondered why she kept so quiet, and gave him so little chance of knowing her better. But, now that she was in a measure forced upon him, and his beautiful Helen had rejected lim for the arduous life of a Sister of Charity; now that the idea had become fixed in his mnind that 'Gertrude cared for some one else, and only consented to marry him not to lose the money, for the time being he actually hated her, and never having put any restraint upon his feelings before, he did not care to take the trouble in' this case, hence his conduct.

That night she made up her mind that she must see Helen, and that she would go to her. Before going to bed, she opened, as was her habit, the '"Following of Christ," and the 18th chapter was the one at which her finger rested; it seemed just suited to her case.   126    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER XVII. "Christ.-Son, I will teach thee the way of peace and true liberty. Disciple.-Do, Lord, I beseech thee as thou sayest, for I will be very glad to hear it." GERTRUDE carried out her intention of going to Helen the next day but one; she needed small preparation for so'short a journey and no escort, consequently she told Mrs. Beresford she wished nothing said to Mon- trose on-the subject. Mrs. Beresford's position was a trying one, on one hand, she saw her favorite Gertrude suffering from some secret trouble, of which she never spoke to her, and from any question, her position as Montrose's mother, debarred her; on the other, her son preserved a strict silence also to her on the one subject in all their minds, and never gave her the opportunity of   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     127 speaking to him. Much as she loved her, she was glad to be relieved of Gertrude's presence for a few days, for she began to feel that the forced cheerfulness with which the young girl sought to hide her heartache, was a tacit rebuff to her for the little she had had to do in bring- ing this sad state of affairs about. Great was Helen's surprise when sent to the parlor to see her sister. Gertrude had many of her old companions and teachers to greet, that first evening of her arrival, so it was not till the next day, that she had an opportunity of speaking to Helen on the subject that had brought her there. In   virtue of her old scholarship, she was established in the " stran- gers' room," opening into "the cabinet," and the Novice was allowed to be with her sister all the time. So Gertrude's story was told, and when done, poor Helen could say little to com- fort her. Still it was a comfort to be together again, and the hope fixed itself in Gertrude's heart, that perhaps Helen would return with her. This idea came more and more before her, until she felt that she could not return without her.

She did so, and after explaining as much as she thought necessary, the Mother told her that, in such a case, she could not decide at once, but would let her know the next day. Gertrude was obliged to be satisfied with this arrangement, although she had been away from home four days, and would be obliged to remain now three days longer, as the Sunday intervened.' Helen and the Mother held a long consulta- tion, and Helen told her she felt it an impera- tive necessity to be with Gertrude till she was married; still the idea of returning to her father's house, as Helen Montarges, was very distasteful to her, owing to the remarks that would of course be made, the curiosity that would be excited, and which, of course, could be satisfied by no explanation. , But Helen felt that in"Gertrude's present frame of mind, it was her duty to be with her as much as possible. It was finally arranged, that though Helen had not completed the three months probation previous to assuming the dress, in this case she might do so, and take up her residence at the Asylum in Philadelphia, with full permission   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    129 to be with her sister night and day, if she felt the necessity. This great privilege was only granted under the exigencies of the case, such a thing never having been known before. Great was Gertrude's peace of mind, and relief -that Sunday as she knelt once more at High Mass before the altar. The sermon from the beloved Father, who had been the Director of the Order for years, sounded very natural in its broken English; he spoke simply of the trials and sorrows -that encompass us in this world, and pointed out the only source of comfort and consolation. That afternoon  the two sisters walked through the old scenes once more together; it was very cold, and the ground was frozen, so they wandered down to Tbl's  Creek, but did not penetrate to the "Paradise." In the evening Father Boland came out from the village to say good-bye; Gertrude enjoyed the visit, for the kind Father had been one of her best beloved friends in her school days. She bade, farewell to all friends, and the next morning was on her way home, Helen her com- panion. No one knew of Helen's presence in the city   130    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. but Mrs. Beresford and Gertrude, and of course Margaret and Kate. Great was the latter's surprise when told that "Miss Helen" had been sent so soon on a mission to her old home, and still more when they found her coming every day to the house, for hours, sometimes, though not often, remaining over night. i       A+    THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    131 CHAPTER XVIII. "For wedlock without love, some say, Is but a lock without a key."' ACfUHE travellers had been heard from fre- ]fijg quently, and towards the close of Jan- -uary came a letter from Mr. Montarges, saying they would sail in the next steamer. Gertrude was rejoiced at the thought of seeing her father, but dreaded his coming, too, for then there would be no reason for further delay, and she feared he would urge her to fix an early day for the marriage. She had fully made up her mind that she would not allow it before the last day of the allotted time, the 12th of May. Mr. Montarges was highly delighted when he found Helen was in the city, and of course he saw her immediately on his return.' But HHel- en's explanation of the reasons that brought her there, could not but worry him. He was a man   132    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. of few words, very much abstracted in his own thoughts, and if there were no complaints made to him, apt to think all around him contented and satisfied i He found Gertrude looking pale and anxious on his return, but as she said noth- ing about her feelings, and did not seem at all ill, he gave it no serious thought. ow, he felt indeed anxious, and resolved to watch carefully the conduct of his son-in-law. But Montrose, from no visible reason, suddenly changed from the cold, indifferent politeness, which barely veiled his dislike, to the easy freedom of his cousinship; which change, Gertrude noticed silently, and although it made no difference in her manner, her father after watching for a few days for some indication of the state of things, as Helen had represented them, made up his mind that Montrose was of an undemonstrative disposition, and this had fretted Gertrude. Satisfied with this conclusion, Mr. Montarges set his mind at rest, and devoted himself to the necessary arrangements this great change had induced. Had he found that Gertrude was really suffering from Montrose's unkindness, no worldly motive could have deterred him from breaking the engagement at once; but he was   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     133 easily satisfied that all was right, and so let matters take their course. It was the night of the 12th of February, their joint birthdays, that Gertrude first felt the change in Montrose's manner. Mr. Montarges threw open his house that night in formal announcement of his daughter's engagement. Montrose came early in the evening; he had not seen Gertrude before that day. She was alone, bending over a vase of flowers, in sad thought; when he entered the parlor, his step was light, and as she had not heard the bell, she was not aware of his presence till she felt the touch of his hand on hers. He had taken the left one, and slipping a splendid solitaire upon the third finger, pressed it to his lips saying: "Let us be better friends cousin Gertrude from this time, and if we cannot love one another, do not let the world see it!" "I have no desire to let the world see our skeleton," replied Gertrude, somewhat bitterly, "but this change on your part is sudden, to say the least!" "Better late than never!" replied Montrose, in a light tone. Gertrude looked at him in silence, then turn-' 12   134    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. ed away; she did not want him to see the ex- pression of her face, for her heart was troubled, and her face showed it. Could she love this careless idler, whom nothing seemed to touch, or had she not better gather up the priceless, jewel she had laid at his feet, only to see him trample on it, hide it away, where it would never see the light; or, better still, essay to des- troy it in the thrice heated furnace of her just anger? The young girl's thoughts were very bitter as she turned away, but her father's entrance, and the loud ring at the bell that announced the coming of her guests, caused her to stifle all expression of them. a'   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     135 CH-T APTER XTX. Oh, marriage, marriage! what a curse is thine, When hands alone consent, and hearts abhor!" s she feared, her father wished to hurry the marriage, but Gertrude was firm, and    would listen to nothing of the kind. The 12th of May was the day she had fixed upon, and she would not change it. Mon- trose, after ascertaining her wish in this regard, never mentioned the subject again. He lounged away every evening at the house, and some- times joined Gertrude in her walks, and very frequently took hereto  ride.  This being his favorite exercise, and  Gertrude soon proving herself a  good horse-woman, it was the pleas- antest way of getting rid of the time. In her trouble, an idea came to Gertrude that no one seemed to have thought of before. Mon- trose and she were cousins, but in what degree   136    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. she never ascertained; now, as a last chance of reprieve, came the hope that tiley were within the prohibited ones. She carried this doubt to her confessor, but- Father Arnoth told her he could not help her there as, when he first heard of the engage- ment, he had examined into the relationship, and found they were just beyond the pale: there would be no dispensation required. Poor Gertrude! when this hope failed her she gave up all thought of escape, and quietly resigned herself to her fate. Montrose had purchased a superb residence out Walnut Street, and given Gertrude carte- blanche as to the furnishing of it; this, with the preparations for her wedding, kept her very busy. Mrs. Beresford was still an inmate of Mr. Montarges' house, and Gertrude would not hear of her leaving her. Helen managed her visits so as never to meet Montrose: though he often wondered what took Gertrude so fre- quently to the asylum. If he had any idea of Helen's being in the city, he said nothing about it to his mother or cou'sin. So the days followed each other, bringing a sadder hopelessness to Gertrude, a longing to   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     137 lay her weary head down under the green, fresh sod, and leave the world, its riches, and de- lights to those on whom it sniiled. She did not vary her conduct towards her alfianced husband in all this time. Now her eyes never sparkled at sound of his voice or footstep, her cheek never flushed at touch of his hand: she seemed to have locked her feel- ings up in a casing of ice that nothing would ever melt. She tried to thinlk his conduct had killed her love, and almost grew to believe it; and that, as she never would care for any one in the world any more, it did not matter what hap- pened to her, whether she married Montrose, or, at the last moment, something should hap- pen to prevent the ceremony. In this miserable state of mind the wedding- day morning found her. She went to the holy table that morning, and prayed fervently for strength and courage. Helen received with her, and, after breakfast, bade her "farewell." The parting was agonizing in' Gertrude's grief, for she felt as if with Helen would depart all her fine-spun theories of indifference and stoic- ism. But the young Novicewas to return home. Her frst" mission" was ended, her presence   138    THE MONTARGES LEGACY*. and affection would avail Gertrude no more, henceforth no third person could comfort her; her husband must be her all the world, or she must stand alone, more utterly desolate and forlorn, amid the grandeur of her surroundings, than the veriest beggar at her gate. Had Gertrude been allowed her own way, the wedding would have been a quiet and pri- vate one, and she would have worn her plain grey traveling suit, and started on her "tour" without any extra display.  But this the family would not listen to, and Montrose him- self objecting very decidedly, it was a grand affair. Her wedding dress had been M ontrose's choice, and was, of course, gorgeous. Under the white moire and the point-lace veil, Gertrude hid her breaking heart as best she might, and let them deck her for the sacrifice as they would. The Bishop performed the ceremony, and through it all the bride went like one in a- dream.  At last it was over! the blaze of lights, the well-meant, but to Gertrude, cruel congratulations of her friends were at an end, and she sank back into the corner of the carri- age, in which they were driving to the depot glad to be silent, and in the-.dark.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     139 Their wedding tour was an extended one, and a weary time to Gertrude. In every attention to her comfort, and in planning from one day to another some expe- dition or amusement, Montrose spared no pains, and his manner before people was one of quiet kindness, but further than that he never went. To the servants or acquaintances he always spoke of her, as "Mrs. Beresford," never as " my wife." He never entered her rooms without a formal announcement of his conling. The little while they were alonetogether were very weary whiles to Gertrude, for he kept up a careless conversation about what had occurred du- ring the day, or the day before, or sonme article in the papers that had no personal in- terest in it. They made the tour of the Southern States, and from New Orleans to St. Louis, made the trip in one of those floating palaces that grace the western waters; thence, by way of the lake-shore route, they found themselves in New York. After a couple of weeks there, they sought the cool airs of the WIhite Mountains, or the Androscroggin, way up in Maine, and there spent the hot months of July and August.   "O    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Despite her sadness of heart, Gertrude could not but enjoy the magnificent scenery around her; and the gaiety of the people whom she met, sometimes diverted her, but most often it only made her own heart the heavier. So Gertrude began her married life--the career looked forward to by most all women with blissful anticipations. And what had Ger- trude done, that the cup held to her lips should be so bitter? She saw many women around her happy in their families, with husbands as ten- der and devoted, as the first weeks of their mar- riages; she saw other wives like herself, in the first blush of their honors, happy in the undis- guised devotion of their lover-husbands, with not a thought, not a feeling apart, not a wish unanticipated! Then she went back into the desolate chamber of her own heart, and wept bitter tears over this misery, that had been en- chained upon her, this cross that she must bear that another might reap the reward. Very bitter for awhile were Gertrude's feel- ings towards her father; she could not under- stand how blind he really was to the true state of things, she thought because love made her quick sighted, it must do so with others. She   THE. MONTARGES LEGACY.     141 had not fully comprehended the task she had devoted herself to; while it was only in con- templation, she thought it would be easy enough to keep a calm face to the world, and use would soon ease the burden to her shoulder. But after her marriage she found out her mis- take. The burden was doubly heavy; she could not go out into the world, and claim the free friendship of a single woman; she could not act independently of her husband, and say, "our marriage is only a sham-we are no more one now, than we were six months ago, I care not for him, or he for me!"No; she must listen silently and calmly to the references made to the happiness she must feel in having so hand- some and charming a, husband-she must hear the tender confidences other married women made to her, thinking to find full sympathy in her own happy wifehood-she must bear all this with a smiling brow and placid demeanor, and begin to find that her whole life is to be an acted lie! A sad and weary burden for this poor eigh- teen year-old girl to bear, and if she bears it to the end without failing, it will only be by con- stant effort, and by earnest prayer.   "2      THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CH APTER XX. "I Now all the youth in England are on fire, And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies; Now strive the armorors, and honor's thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man." Sy^HE house Montrose had purchased was a very palace, and Gertiude had furnished it before her marriage according to her taste. On their return in the fall they found every thing  as bright, pleasant, and  home-like as loving hands could make it; but as Gertrude's feet sank in the rich pile of the carpet, and she saw herself reflected in the superb mirrors, and Oglanced  around at the costly and luxurious articles of furniture, her heart sank within her, and she with difficulty stifled an hysterical sob, as the longing arose in her heart for the love that was denied   her, without which  all this   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    143 splendor was a mockery, and with which, a poor and humble house would have been a palace: She wished Mrs. Beresford to live with her, partly from her affection for her mother-in-law, partly, because she dreaded the isolation to which she knew she would be doomed, in that great big house. But Mrs. Beresford wisely refused, nor could all Gertrude's pleading move her to change her mind. She had a suit of rooms near them, and could see her children every day. She felt that if ever a change should come, and this unhappy fate she felt she had been instrumental in bringing upon them, be changed to joy and happiness, no third party could help-the change must be the work of their own hearts, and be wrought by their own hands. Mr. Montarges still remained in the old quiet house in the square, and, in a few weeks, every one had settled down in the routine they were to follow. Montrose's conduct never varied; polite and attentive to her always, his manner grew no warmer.' The little while they chanced to be alone together were weary whiles to Gertrude,   "4    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. for he either preserved a cold silence, or con- v'ersed with her with a calm politeness, that nearly drove her crazy, on every and all topics of general interest, as he would have striven to make the time pass pleasantly with a perfect stranger. In his quiet moods she would pretend to be busy with a book or her work, but would watch closely every turn of expression in the handsome face, as if seeking for something to feed her hopes upon. One day she came into the library, not know- ing Montrose was in the house. He was upon the lounge asleep. He had fallen into a grace- ful pose, as he lay there in the abandonment of sleep, his head resting on the sofa cushion, with the' glossy black curls spread out on it as he had pulled them, a habit he had, and his hand :nd arm thrown up over his head. The firm thin lips were covered by the mustache, but the profile, with its classic outlines, was in full relief against the crimson covering of of the cushion, and the long black lashes lay on the manly cheek. Gertrude stood and gazed, at first, with a smile of pleasure at the superb picture, but as she gazed the smile changed to an expression of yearning misery, and she   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    145 clasped. her hands convulsively, though she uttered no sound. iHer earnest look must have aroused Mon- -trose, some natures being peculiarly sensitive to such things, for presently he opened his large grey eyes upon her. He lay for a second, look- ing at her, then springing up gave himself a- shake, put his hands in his pockets, and said with a sneer-; as he lounged to the window: "Practicing for Lady Macheth, or Judith, Gertrude?-sorry the tableau had no witness, it was very effective." "I am very sorry I disturbed you, Montrose," she replied, quietly, "I did not know you were here when I came in for a book; I was very quiet, hoping not to wake you." She had helped herself to the book she was in search of, and left the room as she finished speaking, leaving Montrose standing at the window, drumming on the panes and whistling the tenor solo in the Miserere of "II Trovatore." There were never any confidences between them, never any rendering an account to each other, how the time spent apart was passed. Montrose enquired regularly every morning, if she had any commands for the day; or if she   "6    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. wished to go to the opera; or accepted Mrs. So and So's invitation-if answered in the nega- tive, he made his own arrangements, and after dinner Gertrude would not see him till break- fast the next day. Once or twice she tried to induce him to remain at home, by proposing a book she would like him to read aloud, or suggesting a duet, she would like to practice, but his compliance was so forced, and his politeness so cold and formal on both occasions, that she had no heart to re- peat the experiment. They entertained largely at home, and Montrose was always a charming host; so that as Gertrude could not always lift the burden from her soul, and be merry and light-hearted among strangers as he was, though her manner was always affable and amiable people began to say, what a pity it was so delightful a man should be thrown away on that plain, quiet woman. Mr. Montarges never noticed that anything was wrong, and Gertrude strove more before her father than before strangers even, to keep back the look of misery her face sometimes wore, in spite of the watch she kept over her- self, lest any one should hear the faintest rattie   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    147 of the bones of her skeleton. But a constant strain will make even the sweetest tempered impatient at times, and so sometimes Gertrude gave way, and a quick word or an angry look ir  would escape her, only to be as quickly atoned for the next moment. It was generally Mar- garet, the faithful girl that had lived with the XMontarges for many years, and now followed XGertrude's fortunes, who witnessed any thing of the kind, and she loved her mistress too dearly, and saw too well what her cause of trouble was, to resent it. So the time went on: Gertrude and Mrs. "ii Beresford were much together, doing good among the poor, and relieving many a heart- 1   ache, while their own were heavy. And meantime the cloud, first seeming like a harbinger of a summer shower, broke in all the Iit  fury of a tempest over the devoted land, and E brought with it greater changes than the gay i -  and thoughtless ever could have dreamed. The year 1861 broke upon us, and changed the face of all things. Mrs. Beresford was taken very ill after New Year's, and, in spite of Dr. Minturn's care and skill, after several weeks of suffering, sank under the disease.   "8    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Her loss was severely felt by Montrose, who loved his mother with a great love; and Gfer- trude hoped that the sorrow they shared to- gether would at last unite them. His mother, just before she died, drew Montrose down to her and tried to say somnething, but her voice was gone, and all he could hear was "love" and "Gertrude." Of this he said nothing, and after the funeral their life at home returned to its usual routine; and Gertrude missed the gentle presence and kindly voice of her who had been her daily companion now for so long a time. As the months passe'd, and war grew more and more certain, MAontrose seemed awakened into a new life. And when April came, with all its excitements, he was among the first to volunteer. He  entered the "Lancers" as a private, and said nothing to Gertrude till the act was done; and, when he did tell her, it was as coolly as if he merely announced that he was going to New York.   Gertrude received the announcement with outward composure, asked what he wished done, attended to all his wants; But when she was alone at night her tears were none the less bitter that they had been repressed till then.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     149 ' By the bye, Gertrude," said. Montrose the next morning, before going down to the "Ar- mory," "I think you will be more comfortable with your father than in this large house. You can do as you please, and you had better think about it." Q Gertrude did think about it, and preferred takting a suite of rooms in a boarding-house, where she would be free to move at any time. She could not bear the idea of returning to her father's house, after all that she had suffered there, and the changes that had taken place since she left it; so the establishment, was broken up, the house left in charge of Kate, who had married the coachman a few weeks before. Gertrude retained  her horses and carriage, and kept Margaret still as her maid. Every one remembers the excitement, so great at the time, so like a dream to look back upon, except where some vacant chair tells all too plainly of the stern reality. Montrose's regiment was to start for Washington at 10 o'clock on the morning of the 2d of May. Gertrude was to take possession of her rooms the next day; and so, before they had been   150    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. married a year, husband and wife were to part -for how long? Little had been said the night before, for Gertrude could not trust herself to talk, and the next morning everything was in confusion. At length the time came for saying good- bye, and Montrose knockled at her door; she opened it for him, pale as a ghost, her large eyes were suffused with unshed tears. "Well, G-ertrude," he said, holding out his hand, the best of friends must part-good-bye!" 'C You will write to me?" she asked. ' Certainly; if you wish it, or care to hear from me." "It would look so strange; you know we must keep up appearances," was Gertrude's reply. "Yes, you are right; and now good-bye ; I must be gone." He drew her towards him, and for the first time in his life he kissed his wife. Gertrude's first impulse was to throw her arms around his neck and sob out her grief upon his breast, but the remembrance of his cool reception of such a demonstration once before, checked her, and even now he was so hard and cold she feared to venture a caress.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    151 Who knows but in that supreme hour of parting the ice might have been broken, and husband and wife seen into each other's hearts, and been united for ever, had she followed her first promptings. But it was not to be; the molllent passed, and Gertrude withdrew herself from his eimbrace, and said, calmly; "Good-bye; and God bless you!" "Well, that's well over," thought Montrose, as he hurried down the street; 'L that we may not meet again, will not, I guess, break her heart." So, they parted. Montrose mnade no effort to obtain a "leave" during the first year of comparative inaction, nor did he write often, particularly after the hot work in the peninsula began. He was soon promoted from the ranks, and transferred to another regiment as major. t;G J^S   152     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER, XXT.

S ERTRUDE spent the summer anxiously look- ing for news, but the fighting was not very heavy, except the Ball's Bluff affair, and little was done in the eastern part of Virginia. And the lovely fall weather, that lasted that year up to New Year's day, was wasted by Mc- Clellan in " masterly inactivity," and it was not till after Christmas, that the war began in earn- est. Then there was a call for nurses, and help from the women of the North, that was nobly answered. While Miss Dix and her army of nurses were praised and lauded for their self-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    153 devotion, the white "cornette". of the Sister of Charity, the black veil of those of Mercy, were seen in every hospital and nearly every battle-field, and little said about them. Helen wrote to Gertrude, that she had been sent to Lincoln Hospital at Watshington, and Gertrude immediately determined to join her. Her father and Mr. Macgregor tried to dissuade her, but she was firm, and in a few days had made all her arrangements and was in Wash- ington. She devoted herself to all the hospitals. The churches had been transformed for the use of the soldiers, and were unlder the care of the ladies of the city, and in one or the other, she spent a part of every day. The Jesuits had built hospitals near their church, in order to preserve it to its proper use, and these were under the care of the Sisters of Mercy; but the Sisters of Charity had Lin- coln Hospital and several others. Gertrude and Helen were much together, although Gel:- trude's field of work was larger. The spring passed and summer began, and still the weary work in the peninsula went on, and trains and boats were constantly bringing their loads of dead and wounded. One day   154    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Gertrude on entering Lincoln Hospital, was met at the door by Helen. There had been a fresh set of wounded arrived that morning and among them, many officers. Helen was just going over to the building set aside for them, and Gertrude went with her. Htelen entered the ward first, while Gelrtrude paused to speak to sorme one. In a moment Helen returned and drew Gertrude into the little place called the "doctor's room." "Dear Gertrude, do you think you are strong enough to bear a very painful sight?" "Strong!- ah  Helen, I know what you mean, he is there!" Helen only bowed her head, and Gertrude raising her eyes to heaven, said: "Then my * hands have found their work, God give me strength to do it; I will go to him, at once!" Frequently as Gertrude had told herself that this might happen at any time-that any morn- ing might occur this meeting, just as it had done, she could not prevent a' shudder and a heart sickness seizing her as she approached his bed, not knowing what sight would meet her eyes. Montrose lay in the delirium of fever, and   TIIE MOSTARGES LEGACY.   155 knew no one; his wound was not, or would not have been a dangerous one, had not this fever supervened. He lay on the little hospital bed. a sad wreck of the handsome soldier who had marched so gallantly to the music of the can- non.. His beautiful hair had been cut off, and his skin was sunburnt and parched with fever. Gertrude looked in silent sorrow as she stood at the side of the bed. He muttered something and turned uneasily, and she laid her hadll on his burning brow, he started and looked at her and then at Helen, but there was no recogni- tion in his glance. He was still on the battle- field and giving orders to his men; again he called his mother, and begged her to give him something to drink; once he said, "Helen," but that was all, and Gertrude's name he never men- tioned. She had him removed to a house on the hos- pital grounds, and there she gave herself up night and day to nursing him. Sometimes Helen, or one of the other sisters, would relieve her. But she seldom left him during the weary weeks the fever lasted. How often her sad and weary heart was made to bleed afresh! Ilis talk was always of his mother and of Helen, or   156    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. of the camp and battle-field, and once or twice only did he mutter something about that " tire- some Gertrude." Gertrude's musings, during her many vigils, were without one comfort. How strange it seem- ed, that love for this handsome, bright boy had closed her heart to all else, and that fate in grant- ing her heart's desire, had rendered it greater tor- ment than any disappointment would have been! The weeks of nursing passed, and though the fever released its hold, and he was convalescing, his brain did not recover its balance, and he was still unconscious of his surroundings. The phy- sicians began to look grave, and feared that though the body would recover, the mind was hopelessly diseased. As his strength came back, his delirium increased, and Gertrude could no longer nurse him, she was obliged to relinquish her task to two men, and could seldom enter the room. Just at this time came a telegram from Mr. Macgregor, saying that Mr. Montar- ges was very ill, if Gertrude could possibly leave, she must come home. Fortunately for poor Gertrude's satisfaction, Montrose had a quiet spell, during Wrhich he slept calmly that day, and she was able to   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     157 stand once more at his bedside, and press her lips to his forehead ere she left him. Mr. Montarges' illness was a sort of typhoid, and, as he had always been remark-ably healthy, Hand had a strong constitution, he did not take, sufficient care of himself at first, but let the disease get such a hold on him, that the doctor had little hope from the beginning. Faithfully Gertrude nursed her father, but she had not been home three days, before she telegraphed Helen to join her if possible. This, under the sad circumstances, Helen was allowed to do, and so his two children received his dying breath. Mr. Montarges had not been a member of any church, and, as we have seen, was very lenient and unprejudiced in regard to his wife and daughters, often saying, if he felt the necessity of any religion, he would go with them. fNow, that the call had come so sud- denly, he had little time for preparations, and, his voice failing so early in his sickness, all he could do was to answer Father Arnoth's ques- tions by signs. The day before he died he was baptised, and received extreme unction; he died in the evening, after a day of great suffering, but passed in the end quietly away. 13   158    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. And so Gertrude's sacrifice was all for nourlght; scarce three years, and he, for whom she had de- voted herself to this living sorrow, was no more, and pride of birth and honor, were alike empty words to him. During her father's illness, Gertrude had been kept fully informed of Montrose's state, which lasted pretty much the same all through that time. Now, her duty ended here; she was preparing to return to her post there, when it was ordered otherwise.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     159 ,CHaAPTER XXTT. "Muse not that I suddenly proceed, For what I will I will, and there's an end." GERTRUDE constitution was not proof against the great tax laid upon it, and after her father's death, she sank under grief and fatigue, and was herself very ill. The "mother" being in the city at the timre, Helen was, of course, allowed to remain and nurse her sister. Gertrude's illness was a low, nervous fever, and lasted into the autumn; when -the cool weather camle, she began to mend.   But Dr. Minturn prescribed perfect rest, and positively forbade any nursing or extra effort the whole winter. Her ill health, Aher deep mourning for her father, and the uncertainty of Montrose's state, was sufficient excuse for utter seclusion, and so Gertrude was   160    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. free from the necessity of acting a part. She saw but few, and those her most intimate friends, they might be easily counted; for she was not one to make many friendships. Meantime, Montrose recovered his senses, and saw none but stranger faces around him; as they were Sisters of Charity, he had a faint hope that Helen would be among them; but Helen was then occupied with Gertrude. In leaving Washington, Helen had told the Sis- ters that there were reasons why neither her name or his wife's should be mentioned before him, and this request had been religiously ob- served, and he knew nothing of Gertrude's loving care. NWhen he was perfectly recovered, Montrose obtained a "leave," but went no further than the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where he spent his time fishing, and roaming about the country, and where, notwithstanding the ignorant secesh bitterness of the people, he got along very well. With singular inconsistency, he resented Gertrude's apparent neglect of him in his ill- ness, and her disregard of a letter he wrote to her as soon as he was recovered, little thinking   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    161 that the poor girl was tossing on a bed of sick- ness. He joined his regiment at the end of his "Ieave," without making any effort to see his wife; and when Helen returned to her post she found him gone. All through that weary winter there was no news of him, save through the papers, and at last came the tidings that he was a prisoner; Visions of Libby and IBelle Isle, of Anderson- ville and Columbia, came before Gertrude, but she felt utterly powerless, and only suffered the more. Months and months passed, and yet no tidings came of him; at last an exchanged prisoner from Andersonville brought a letter from him ; he was there, enduring all the tor-     tures of that living death! This was all Gertrude heard of him for more than a year, for some fifteen months, and in the meantime the term for which his regiment had 'enlisted expired, and the men were coming home. Sad was the day to'Gertrude, as to many an aching heart besides, when " the boys" wualked up from the depot, with their tattered flags and thinned ranks, to the tune of "When Johnny comes marching home."   162    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. A few more anxious months, and then a letter reached Gertrude from Montrose, dated Paris. He had made his escape from Ander- sonville ; and, not being able to reach our lines, had " played rebel" so well that he had no diffi- culty in getting passage on a blockade-runner, ^when, after many wanderings and escapes, he reached the gulf shore. The blockader had taken him to Cuba, and thence he had taken passage for France. The severity and depriva- tions of his prison life had affected his health to such an extent that the physician whom he consulted in Paris, ordered him to the south of France and Italy, and strongly objected to his returning home for some time to come. "I am sorry, Gertrude, for your sake that Anderson- ville anLd Wirtz did not make an end of me, the letter went onr; '; but as it was not to be, I suppose you will submit with your usual philosophy; meanwhile, I will not trouble you with letters. I have sent in my resignation to the War Office, though, I think, before it reaches them, the term of my regiment will be out. : have written to Macgregor to send me sufficient to keep me afloat without troub- ling him for several years, and if I do not get ,    THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    163 stillettoed in Naples, poisoned in Auvergne, or tumbled from an Alpine glacier, you may ex- pect to see me at home  not until I am tired of myself and everything here. Perhaps when we meet again we will not know each other! Do not trouble yourself to write to me, Mac- gregor can keep us sufficiently posted as to each other's movements." Poor Gertrude! had he but recognised her anxious face bending over his sick bed, this blow might have been spared her. For in the lonely camp watches Montrose had had much time for thought, and he was disposed to feel more kindly towards his wife from this long separation, had not his pride and pique taken alarm at her seeming neglect of him during his sickness, and of his letter afterwards. So often does it happen in this weary world: a little word unspoken, a simple action neglected, will open such stores of untold sorrow. When Mr. Macgregor next saw Gertrude she was changed very much. She was no longer the quiet, sad, disappointed girl, taking things as they came, and submitting to her fate with passiveness. She had made her resolution, and determined to act upon it.   164    THE MONTBRGES LEGACY. She told Macgregor that she would not bring herself to her husband's mind in any way; she would, perhaps, never see him again; but, that her time would not be lost in vain repinings, she would study and work, and the large for- tune of which she was the uncontrolled mis- tress would give her ample means to gratify her tastes. -But she must sever all ties that bound her to the past; she must change her residence, even her very name. This Mr. Mac- gregor combated strongly, but she was firm on the subject, and had decided upon her plan. She had heard from Helen, who had been sent to New Orleans as soon as the city was in our hands, of the great destitution in which she found their aunt, and had written to her, offer- ing her a home, which offer had been gladly accepted. Mrs. Clayton had been a strong Union woman, and had suffered accordingly. Under her aunt's protection and name Ger- trude was determined to live for the future, and to leave Philadelphia. The better to secure her incognito; she intended sailing for Liver- pool, but to return immediately to New York, and there take up her abode. She had no ac- quaintances in New York, but could provide   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     165 herself with letters to the Archbishop, to whom she could confide her secret, and rest under his protection. To all Mr. Macgregor's objections, she returned but the one answer: it was the plan she intended to carry out, so, if her hus- band ever came back, her poor face would never cloud his happiness. Fortunately for her, Gertrude had never had many intimacies. Her sister had been her con- fidant and friend; and although there were many who cared much for her sincerely, apart from the crowd who were attracted by her wealth, there were none to whom   she felt obliged to render any account of her actions, or who would be apt to make any particular inquiries after her. To those who did inquire of Father Arnoth or Macgregor, the answer was that she had gone to England, it was not necessary to add that she had returned to New York. There the beginning of the year 1865 found them, aunt and niece, living in quiet retire- ment. Gertrude devoted herself to her favor- ite books, and perfected herself in music and the languages she had studied at school. To the cultivation of her fine, rich contralto she   166    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. gave much care and time. Margaret was still with her, and as devoted as ever. In the summer Mrs. and Miss Clayton sought relief from the heat at Newport, or among the New England mountains, and everywhere Gertrude was a favorite. She could not spend her large income living so quietly as they did, for she particularly avoided anything like display. But the poor blessed her in their daily prayers, and the sick and suffering looked upon her as a dear friend and tender nurse. The war was over, and quietly the soldiers disbanded and re- turned to their plowshares or professions, and still no word canme from Montrose. And so the years went on till 1867. Gertrude had lived just the life she had planned for herself. But no forethought could destroy memory, and it gave her many bitter hours. Then, too, the thought of the position in which she was placed was very painful. De- barred by her secret fromn taking the place in society natural to her years; deprived of the happiness of a wife ; standing utterly alone, and yet longing, oh, so deeply, for the sweet com- panionship, the fond trust and sympathy from   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      167 which a cruel fate had cut her off, while it gave her no compensating consolation. In this anom- alous situation, was it a matter of surprise, if at times Gertrude's cheerfulness forsook her, and she gave way to gloom and despon- dency? To some, the mere fact of doing the duty set before them to be done, is sufficient; they can devote themselves to tasks utterly repugnant to their nature, if a stern duty points to the. neces- sity of their fulfilment, and are perfectly satis- fied if their own consciences or sense of right whisper approval, looking for, asking for no hu- man sympathy, no loving words from tender hearts. There are others who shrink from such tasks with painful weakness if left to their own strength, who will display a martyr's firmness, if aided by the feeling that there is one, loving and beloved, to be aided or pleased by the sacri- fice, and who count the sacrifice as nothing, if a kindly voice whispers " well done." Such was Gertrude's nature, and yet strong in its weakness; with heart-sick yearning for that which  it never found, it carried her through the dreary years, fighting the battle   168    THE. MONTARGES LEGACY. with itself, and if it sometimes lost in the strug- gle, it more often won. Margaret was still her faithful attendant, and Mrs. Clayton, a delicate, frail invalid, gave her the protection of her name. - To her, Gertrude was uniformly gentle and kind, but there was no deep bond of feeling between them. The niece's nature was to the aunt a sealed book, she could only wonder at the strange hiero- glyphics on the cover; to her it was not given the key that she might open and read. And in this year of our Lord, 1867, was to come the turning point of Gertrude's life.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     169 CHAPTER    XXTTT. "With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go, Athwart the foaming brine; Nor care what land thou bear'st me to, So not again to mine."    ONTROOSE sailed for Europe with a firm determination to see his native land no more. He spent some time in England among his mother's relations; here he was feted, lionized and caressed, invited from one lordly mansion to another, and in this round of pleasantness he spent nearly two years. Of course, it was known that he was married, as the conditions of the will were known to all the connections; and: to the many inquiries about his wife he was at first subject to, he gave such odd, evasive answers, that his friends soon saw the subject was a disagreeable one, and "   170    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. ceased to mention it. They had no word of his to go upon; but seeing and knowing him well, they came to the conclusion that it was Ger- trude's own fault that she was not with him, and imagined hers a disposition rather "diffi- cile." This mystery, and a certain pensive expres- sion that was natural to Montrose's face at times, made him a sort of hero among hiR- English relatives, particularly among the la- dies, who were fond of comparing him to Lord Byron.   There were one or two true-sighted women, however, who found the "air triste" not a sufficient mask, and who gave the gallant colonel his proper deserts, by pronouncing him not a little, though perhaps unconsciously so, selfish, and, in their hearts, they pitied Ger- trude, and would insist that there were always two sides to a story, and, ere they formed their judgment, they would hear the other from the far side of the broad ocean. But Montrose was unconscious alike of their pity and their criti- cism; perhaps had he known it, he would have cared as little. According to his directions Mr. Macgregor had transferred a large sum to his Paris bankers, and as long as this lasted, Mon-   THE MONTAIGES LEGACY.    171 trose was determined to forget, if possible, that he was an Anmerican, and all the hated ties that should have bound him to his home. He was very popular and very charming; no one, to see the soft light in his dark grey eye as he bent over some fair lady at ball or opera, could have imagined the cold glitter into which they could change had the face of his wife come before him. No one, to hear the tones of his voice addressing even a servant, could have imagined the harshness of it when he spoke to Gertrude. Hie sang and played the flute, and was ever ready to gratify the whims, or satisfy the desires, of those he was with; and on weighty and more serious subjects, could interest and hold his hearers' attention, by. the variety of his knowledge and the keenness of lhis under- standing. He had not, after the first six months spent, by the doctor's orders, in the south of France, and a few weeks in Italy, been upon the conti- nent. But, in the spring of '67, a party was formed to take the old tour of the Rhine, and then through Austria and anywhere else their fancy might lead them. Montrose joined them eagerly, and looked forward to the summer   172    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. with keen delight. As two of the gentlemen of the party were old travelers, and knew the" ways of Continental guides, couriers and hotel- keepers, they took upon themselves all the ar- rangements, and he had nothing to do but enjoy the fruits of their labors. Very pleasant was that boating up the Rhine, and all the sights and scenes of storied interest; but at length they found themselves at Cologne, with regret that so much of their pleasant trip was over. At Cologne they determined to go to Vienna, and there Montrose made an acquaintance that was to influence much of his future life. Robert Norris was an attache of the U. S. legation at Vienna; he was a young man of pleasant manners and  address, fine mind, cultivated, intelligent, and witty. A warm friendship arose between the two, and, on part- ing, Norris promised to join the party a few weeks later. He did so at Geneva, and their intimacy and friendship grew rapidly. Mon- trose's English friends joked him a good deal about the new friendship, and declared them- selves jealous, but the two Americans bore their raillery in good part, and acknowledged that   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    173 the tie of fellow-countryman was a very strong one, particularly in a strange land. : They spent the summer and fall in traveling through the Swiss mountains; but before- the English party was ready to return, affairs of importance called Robert Norris again to Vi- enna, where Montrose promised to visit him on the completion of the present expedition. 13eresford!" HC Here!" ; Where?" "Don't you see? -look up!" Lord Rocklafellar obeyed his friend's voice and looked up. There, on a ledge of rocks some fifty feet above him, stood Montrose and the Earl of Chester. "I How in the name of wonder did they get up there?" exclaimed his lordship to the guide, who had remained with him, when he loitered behind the rest, on the beginning of the ascent of Monte Rosa. "Easily, my lord, if they followed the path," replied the guide, turning to one side of the road they had been sJowly mounting, " would my lord join his friends?"   /   -  * 174    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "Most assuredly ' my lord' would," returned the other, and he turned to follow. A few moments' climbing the almost per- pendicular sides of the mountain brought them on to a flat surface of rock and earth, about ten by fifteen feet in size, and affording a magnifi- cent view of mountain and valley. "St. George! but this is glorious!" cried Rockafellar, when he joined his friends, who were standing on the edge. Two others of the party were still loitering down the road, and the guides, putting their hands to their mouths, gave the "jodel," or cry peculiar to the herds- men when collecting their flocks. This at- tracted the attention of the stragglers, and soon the whole party were collected on the plateau. "A jolly place for our lunch!" exclaimed one. "Alas! alas! Francis, my son, art thou so obtuse, as to prefer the pampering of thy body, to feeding thy mind with the beauties of the scenes laid out before thee!" replied the Earl, in a jesting tone. "We can eat and look too, can't we?" replied the matter-of-fact young man. "It's all fine, superb, splendid, what you will, but I am mortal, and having climbed nearly 1,100   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    175 feet since morning-I'm   hungry." Accord- ingly the basket, carried by one of the guides, was unpacked, and the charms of mountain and river were for a time in abeyance to those of champagne and cold fowl. ' "Hilloa! what have we here?" cried Mon- trose, and they all followed the direction of his eyes. To the right of the plateau the path wound still higher up the mountain, and it was from that side they had come upon it. The mountain at the back of the plateau was a sheer wall of rock rising some hundred feet,- to the left, and where apparently the plateau ended in a clump of bushes, and the wall of rock suddenly receded, was the spot to which they turned. There, parting the bushes with one hand, and shading her eyes with the other, was the figure of a young girl of about sixteen or seventeen, clad, in the garb of the mountain. peasantry, which displayed to great advantage her lithe and supple figure. The face was sun- burnt; but the features symetrical, and the eyes large and dark. "By Jove, an Oreiad!" cried Rockafellar. "Nymph of the mountain, whence comest thou?" exclaimed the Earl, rising to approach   176    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. her, but at the first movement he made, she turned and to all seeming, melted into air, for the bushes closed behind her, and left no indica- tion of path or road. A loud laugh arose from the party at the discomfited look that crossed the Earl's face; but he said nothing, calmly reseated himself; and finished his meal ill silence. NWhen they had finished the lunch, Chester arose and said, "My friends, when my ancestor won his golden spurs under the third Edward, he chose for his motto, 'Let difficulties only spur on to greater exertion.' It is put more tersely in the Latin, but I translate for the benefit of those not learned in the classics. Now, whether that maiden was flesh and blood, or only a spirit, whether she had a path by which she could retire,-or whether she mounted her broomstick, and spun off into space, re- mains to be proved, and I will begin the inves- tigation instantly; if 'our American Cousin' will come, he is welcome, I don't want any one else-this is my own adventure, and I claim all the peril, as all the praise. Come, Beresford." The guides remonstrated, telling them-that there was a path, but so narrow that only con-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    1" stant practice made it possible for even the mountaineers to follow it, and even the goats refused to tread it. "So much the better,-our expedition so far has been very tame, we want a little excitement -au revoir, mes amis, or good-bye, as the case may be!" and the gay young nobleman, closely followed by Montrose, parted the bushes, that closed again behind them, leaving the rest anxiously waiting the result, which anxiety was increased by the guides, who collected eagerly on that side of the plateau, and seemed to listen for a cry of alarm, or sound of falling bodies. I[   178    TES MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER XXIV. "I do not set my life at a pin's fee." HE  Earl's laughing defiance was soon checked when he found the reality of what he had undertaken, and he paused before he had gone many steps, and  begged Montrose to return. "Not I," he replied; ," I can be spared as well as you, and I can endure as well. I am deter- mined to see this adventure to the end; it will not do to go back; lead on now; the sooner we are out of this the better, so don't lose time in words." It was, indeed, a perilous undertalking. The path was merely a  ledge of rock about three feet wide in some  places; in others, not more than half that. On one side, a sheer descent of   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    179 many hundred feet,; on the other, a continua- tion of the wall of rock, broken here and there, and studded with the short stiff bushes that grow in the interstices. Clinging to these, the two adventurers moved slowly on. Both were silent; for both were busy with their own thoughts, in view of a false step sending them into eternity. At length, after going about the distance of a quarter of a mile along this perilous path, Chester came to a sudden pause, and, reeling, would have fallen had he not sunk upon his knees. "Good God!" exclaimed Montrose; " don't give way, man; we must go on, or----" He, too, paused andi sank down, for as he spoke he had come close behind his companion and--the path had vanished!----Vanished! They saw down far, far below them, the winding waters of the Visp-Thal, gleaming in the afternoon sun, but between them and it, was again the sheer rock of the mountain side. The path had ended as mysteriously as it had begun: on their right and in front of them, the precipice; on their left, the rocky wall. Just then, clear through the still air, came from behind them the "jodel" of the guides, and lo!   180    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. the cry is answered from above, and glancing up, the same female figure is seen standing, to their excited fancy, on a point of rock that scarcely affords a foothold for a bird. Making a sign to remain quiet, she dis- appeared, but presently is seen making her way through the bushes along the top of the rock, and again she disappears; in a few moments she laid her hand on the shoulder of the Earl, and smiled a silent le-assurance. Parting the bushes, the young men see that the path was hidden again by them, but the turn so very abrupt that few would have known of it. A few steps beyond the turn, and again another turn to the left, and they found themselves perfectly safe in an abrupt fissure in the rocks that afforded full room to move about, and even to lie down. In front of them was the valley of the Visp-Thal; be- hind them a steep mountain path led up to the top of the rock which enclosed the space on three sides. The Earl of Chester dashed his hat upon the ground, and, turning, held out hoj hand in silence to his companion. Montrose, too, un- covered, and clasped the proffered hand with a   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    181 sixrong pressure. The two men looked into each- others' pale faces for the space of a minute, and then their hands unclasped, and Chester said, in a tone that was almost a whisper: "Thank God, Beresford, that your blood is not on my hands!" "Thankl Heaven we are both safe," replied Montrose. Almost as they spoke, again through the air came the "jodel" from the guides, and the girl stepped forward to the path and answered it in clear and flutelike tones. To her answering call she added a few new notes, that seemed to convey some mieaning other than the former ones, for the guides repeated them; then, giving out one single note in a loud cry, the maiden turned, and signing to the gentlemen to follow her, sped up the mountain path, while the echoes caught up the last cry she had uttered, and tossed it back and forth, from crag to crag, till it died away in the fa' distance. After some minutes steady climbing, they came upon another plateau, larger than the one where they had left their party. The girl stood at the top of the path until they reached 15   182    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. her side, then, without giving them time to re- cover breath in which to thank her for saving; their lives, she motioned with her hand towards a chalet that stood on the rockl, and disappeared again as quickly as before. In silence the two men looked around them, and saw the projection of rock from which the girl had witnessed their strait, and although seen from a level ground, it did not appear so airy a pinnacle as from below, still it was high and abrupt enough to make their heads turn. At the door of the chalet stood a tall thin man in the long black cassock of a priest. Mon- trose and his companion approached him, but he gathered his robe up from about his feet and advanced to meet them. "You have had a fortunate and most provi- dential escape, my children," he said, baring his white hair in answer to their greeting; ,"never, since I have been the pastor of this parish, and that is nearly fifty years, had stranger feet passed over that ridge in safety." He spoke French with only a slight tincture of the Vallais patois. "You say truly, Father, our escape was al- most miraculous; next to God, we must thank   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     183 that young girl, should we have the chance, though I fear we will not, since she seems as shy as her own chamois," replied Montrose. "She will return in a few moments; she has only gone to pilot the rest of your party by a less dangerous, though far longer route than you chose," answered the priest; " meantime, you must rest here, for I cannot ask you to enter the chalet. If in your safety we can see the hand of God, no less is it seen in bringing you to this spot, for within the cottage of Annette's foster parents, lies, if I mistake not, a compa- triot of yours, and-as he has just fallen asleep, and it would be dangerous to disturb him, I must be pardoned for detaining you Mwithout." "You need make no excuse, sir, and if he is a fellow-countryman, we will be most happy to assist him,9 said the Earl. "N ay, I spoke to your friend, when I said he was a compatriot," replied the priest with a smile. The two looked at each other in amaze- ment, and then Chester laughed, and asked: "And why to him, and not to me?" "Because you are an Englishman; your friend is an American," said he, with a quiet twinkle of amusement in his eye.   184    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "I Upon my word!" exclaimed the Earl, "Mon- trose, this savors of the necromancy of the Dark Ages!" "By no means, my children, I am simply a good student of faces, and I have seen so many travelers from both vour countries, that now I can easily distinguish the difference in accent, (pardon me, an American speaks a softer French) voice, and general appearance," replied the priest. "Your observation has gone farther than ours, my good Father," said Montrose, laugh- ing. "And now tell us how my fellow-coun- tryman came to fall sick, up here among the clouds?" "By attempting what you did, my son, in a different place and with different fortune, for he fell and injured his spine in some way, besides breaking an arm.  The arm I have mended -according to my poor skill, and I think it is- safe; the injury to the spine, will, I fear, prove more serious, and, of course, the head sympa- i thizes, and he lies in a dull stupor, or raves and talks wildly, alternately, all the time; just as you came, he sank into the most natural sleep he has had yet, and I feared to disturb him.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     185 "Do you unite the two professions of the cure of bodies and that of souls?" asked the Earl. "Even so, my son," replied Pere Andres; ",a general outline of the simple portion of the study of medicine is a part of our preparation for our holy calling, and, I assure you, it is a necessary one, particularly in such parishes as mine. My knowledge is neither extensive nor deep: I can mend a-broken limb, or soothe the excited nerves; little else." "Are there many accidents among these mountains, Father.?" asked Montrose. "Not as many as there would be, were not the guides as careful and particular as they are; they consider themselves responsible for the lives of the travelers under their care, and it is a matter of pride with them to have as few accidents happen as possible." "Of course," he added, with a smile, "when strangers take their lives in their own hands, and jeopardize ,! them by such attempts and adventures as yours, gentlemen, they cannot be blamed." "No, certainly, our guides could not: for they really angered me with their protests and opposition," replied the Earl. "But we thought   186    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. where that delicate-looking girl could go, we could follow." "-Annette is very light and sure-footed, quite marvelously so, for one not native to the moun- tains," replied Pere Andrcs. "Yes, I remember, you called the owners of this chalet her foster-parents--" "Her story is a sad one; some time I will tell it to you, but just now I see she is coming with your party, and I will leave you to attend to my patient; will you kindly charge your friends to quietness, for the poor sufferer's sake?" "' Trust us, he will not be disturbed," replied Chester. "I will call you whlen he wakes if he is in a state, in which I think it advisable, to see stran- gers." Bowing, as he spoke, the old man moved across the rocky plateau and disappeared with- in the cottage.   THE MONTA RGES LEGACY.       187 CHAPTER XXV. "Equality is no rule in Love's grammar, That sole unhappiness is left to princes To marry blood." WITH anxious hearts, the party, Chester and Montrose had left, gathered round and watched the faces of the guides. After the first jodel, when it was answered, the head guide, Pierre, muttered " good;"' then thev listened again in silence till anxiety be- came too great, and Lord Rockafellar bade them cry again. This brought the added notes to the girl's answer, and the guides assured them that their friends were safe.  Relieved from their anxiety they returned to the ne- glected lunch; but they had hardly re-seated themselves when the guides spoke to some one behind them, and turning they beheld the same   188    THE MONTA RGES LEGACY. young girl, standing in the path to the right of the plateau. She spoke to the guide nearest her, and pointed up the mountain. He informed the rest that she was waiting to lead them to their friends, and gladly was she followed.' Montrose and the Earl came forward to meet them, and the latter, without noticing the others, approached Annette, and taking off his hat with as much respect as to a lady of high degree, bowed his handsome head over her sun- burnt hand, and pressed it to his lips. Montrose bestowed the like caress, and ven- tured to express his thanks in French. The girl, who had submitted with downcast eyes and heightened color to this expression of thanks, raised her eyes to his face when he spoke, and replied quietly: "I did no more than I ought, as Pere Andres and my mother taught me." Her voice was very sweet, and her accent totally free from patois. While this was passing between Montrose and Annette, the Earl had, in a few words, silenced the noisy greeting of the party, and told them of the narrow escape he and Mon- trose had made.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      189 "Now, my friends, I have a favor to ask: let me be a simple gentleman to this girl, call me Durant, no title, if you please, until I give you permission." "Chester 1 are you not playing with edged tools?" exclaimed Lord Rockafellar. "No; I understand my own game, and shall neither suffer myself, nor injure others," he replied, with marked emphasis on the last words. "Pardon, George," replied Rockafellar, hold- ing out his hand; "I was only surprised, not distrustful; ]elieve me." "I do, Charley; but please remember my re- quest." Just then the priest appeared at the door, and motioned Montrose to him. "Come, -Durant!" said Montrose, with a smile, taking the Earl's arm. Inside the cottage, they stood at the side of the rude couch, upon which lay a young man, whose handsome and refined features bore the stamp of a gentleman. His eyes were open, but with no intelligence in their dark beauty; his chestnut hair hung back from his face in heavy curls. Montrose stooped and laid his hand softly on   190    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. his forehead. The sick man muttered some- thing about "the Adjutant-orders to the front!" "Ah! he has been in the army," said Montrose, turning to the clergyman. ' I must see that he wants for nothing; fortunately one of our party is a physician, and he can do some- thing for him." "I will call Maynard," said the earl, " it is clearly a case that needs him, more than any one." As soon as the young physician saw the sick man, and asked the priest a few questions, he expressed himself satisfied with what had been done, as far as it went, but that, as the priest had felt, was not enough. Fortunately, he had a few medicines with,'him, and after applying some remedies, in the course of a couple of hours, had the satisfaction of seeing them take effect. Meantime, the day had grown older and the guides began to urge their descent, assuring them they would scarcely have time.

G"That young girl is a rare mountain daisy," said Maynard, as the three sat near the edge of the plateau, but so near the cottage door that the slightest movement could be heard. The stranger was sleeping again calmly, and needed no stricter attendance. "That she is," said Montrose "only, pardoin the bull, she is not a mountain flower at all." "No!" exclaimed Maynard, "how do you know?"  "The old priest has promised to tell us her story," said the Earl,' and he added that it was a sad one.' "I am anxious to hear it, for it strikes me she is in a wrong station in life, with these people." "Why!" laughed Maynard, " because she has dark eyes and a profusion of dark hair?" "'No, no! your observations have not been very close, if that is all you have noticed. In the first place, her hand though sunburnt is small and beautifully shaped, her foot too is small and has the arched instep that betokens good blood; her figure is lithe and graceful, and her   192    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. air and carriage would adorn the lordliest d raw- ing room in England!" "Bravo!" cried Maynard, "by my faith, Chester you have lost no time in learning your lesson; why, the girl has not been with us five consecutive minutes, nor fifteen all told," "The next time she comes, take notes and see if I am not right; besides, I have seen some one whom she resembles, but I cannot place the likeness-ah! here she comes! Her French too, is not that of a peasant of the Vallais ;" he added hastily, as Annette returned, accom- panied by her -foster-mother. She told Montrose that her father was busy up the mountain, with his flock, but would be home soon. Presently his jodel was heard, and in a few moments a sturdy, short, thickset peasant made his appearance. Neither husband or wife spoke anything but unmitigated patois, so Annette had to act as interpreter, an office il which the Earl kept her busy, simply as it would seem, to watch the play of her speaking countenance.

Ilowever, the three travelers knew 'how to "rough it," and having brought their plaids with them, and the night being fair, they as- sured their host that they wanted no better accommodations than the mountain heather. Maynard  watched his patient carefully through the night, and towards morning, leav- ing Montrose at his bedside, sought a little sleep. Montrose took the seat his friend had vaca- ted, and as he watched the wan thin features of the patient, his thoughts went back to the weary weeks of his own illness at WAashington, and, of course, to Gertrude. He thought bit- terly of the neglect he had suffered then, as he imagined was the case, and longed in his secret heart for home, rest, and a loving heart to     share his happiness or sorrow. lie began to find the life he had led was very unsatisfactory; ,Iien  and to weary of it, and all the bitterness he had been storing in his heart against his unoffend- ing wife. Gradually he left himself and his own griefs, and began to wonder about Ger- 16   194     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. trude--how she was living and whether she too did not feel tired of the unnatural life they were both leading. So lost was he in his own sad and bitter thoughts, that he had not noticed the sick man had opened his eyes, and was gaz- ing quietly upon him. At length the fixidity of his gaze drew 'Mon- trose's eyes towards him, and as he met their look, he spoke: "I remember a fall,-but,-where,-who are yolu?" "A friend, who found you here in very good hands, but who thought it would be a comfort to you to hear your own tongue spoken when you got better." "Ah, yes! thanks."  He passed his hands over his eyes, and lay quiet for awhile. "What is the matter with me?" he asked at length. "You have had a fall which broke your arm and injured your spine,--you have been here some two weeks,--but you will get well quickly ' Who are you?" he asked again. "A  friend, a fellow countryman, and fellow soldier, have no fears, you are in good hands."   ,7)":T     THR MONTARGES LEGACY.     195 He lay silent for a while, still watching Mon- trose's face. At last, putting his hand out, he said, impatiently, " Where lhave I seen you ?" " Indeed, my dear fellow, I cannot tell you, never before to my knowledge-but do not try to think-you must keep calm and quiet." The sick man closed his eyes, but his brain was evidently busy by the contraction of the brows. Montrose moved quietly out of the room, and meeting the Earl, who had just risen from his mountain bed, told himl that the sick man was himself now, and that, Maynard thought, all danger was over. "Shall you return to Martigny to-day,?' asked Chester. " No, I shall not leave this poor fellow for awhile, at least until he is able to move." 4A quixotic notion, I should say, only it agrees with my project exactly. You stay to take care of your sick countryman, I to keep you company, and watch the dark eyes of Annette." "Are you wise or kind, Chester?" "Nous verrons! anyhow, I am still in igno-    196    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. rance of the history, Pere Andres promised us. I must wait for that, he said he would be back to-day. Annette's resemblance to some one I have seen before puzzles me." "Well, if you are determined to stay, I am glad of your company, but wait the priest's story before you decide upon any course." *-E, A   ;    THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      197 CHAPTER XXVI. "Thou wond'rous yellow fiend! Temper an antidote with antimony, And t'is infectious; mix jealousy withl marriage, It poisons virtue." TRUE to his promise, the priest returned that morning, and expressed great plea- sure in the improvement he found in his patient. Annette seemed very shy of the travelers, and accompanied her mother up the mountain as soon as their simlle breakfast was over. Maaynard sat for an hour, or so, by the sick man's side; and while he was so occupied, the others reminded Pere Andres of his promise to tell them Annette's story. "Ah yes! it is sad to think of the fate of that poor lady, her mother!   It was twelve years ago that three travelers reached Mar- tigny, from Paris. They were a lady, a gentle- man, and a little girl--Annette, then about six years old. The lady was very beautiful, but   198    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. seemed very sad and in great trouble; and- the gentleman tried to soothe and quiet her, and was as fond of, and kind to her as possible. They staid some two or three weeks, and all the time the lady grew worse and worse; one day they decided to leave the hotel, and try what the country air would do for her: so they went to live in Lestroc's farm-house, and for their accommodation three rooms were given up." "Then Lestroc does not live here all the year?" asked the Earl, interrupting him. "By no means: they only spend the summer months here, attending to their cattle that are grazing on the Alps above us. Pierre Lestroce is well off, and owns a large tract of land in the valley below, which he farms himself. He is a person of considerable note among the peasantry of the district.  Well, as I was saying, the strange lady-she was, by-the-by, a  country- woman   of yours, Mr. Durant-tried  what country air would do, and came  to Lestroc's farm. ' The change at first seemed beneficial: her cheeks resumed their natural color, her eyes brightened; she seemed to take much interest   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     199 in Madame Lestroc's dairy, and the gentleman expressed himself very hopeful of getting her as far as Ronme, to spend the winter. IlIe told Lestroc that he was the lady's brother; and certainly he was a most devoted one." "You have not told us their names 3yet, :   Father," said the Earl, who had listened to the priest's story with strong interest. "True, I have not; the lady's name we never knew, except her initials marked on her linen, surmounted by   a  crest; but the gentleman's name was Mortimer.   He always spoke of the lady as 'my sister;' the little girl called her 'mamma,' and the servants 'my lady;' so ,we never heard her name. "At first, as I said, she got better; but it was a deceptive change, and did not last long.: be- fore many  weeks were passed she grew  pale again, and very restless. "Tlhe nmails were watched with great anxiety by the lady, and her brother watched for letters too, and seemed anxious when, day after day, no letter came to her address. At last, one day -j::i --ah! how well I remember it!-the restless fit was strong   upon her, and her brother had ,-:iiJ ordered mules and a  guide from Martigny, to *. tt7   200    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. take them to visit a celebrated echo cave, about half a mile higher up the mountain than this. a- They had been talking about this trip for several days, and at last the lady grew fever- ishy anxious to undertake it. So it was deci- ded they should go this day. "The morning came, and with it the guides and mules from Martigny; but, although the day looked lovely, and promised to continue so, there were ominous clouds hanging over the top of the mountain, that told a different story to those wise enough to read it. "Lestroc was up here at the Chalet, the cows not having all been brought down, al- 'though it was September.  Sometimes, you know, and I think this will be just such a season, the autumn is so late, that the cattle oare left on the Alps till October; but it does lnot often happen: indeed, it has not happened since. Lestroc being away, his wife was very anxious at the persistence of the lady in her whim; both she and the guide tried their best to persuade her out of the idea; and so did her brother, when the guide assured him that a storm was threatened, and might prove fatal. But go she would; and so they set out, the   5{: TTHE MONTARGES LEGACY.          201 poor guide by no means pleased with his task. On their way they met Lestroc and his herds- man bringing down the rest of the cattle; and great was good Pierre's astonishment to meet his lodgers. He too predicted a storm, and urged them to return; but the lady was more and more determined to go forward, and grew quite angry at the delay. "' They had- left the little girl behind with Madame Lestroc, who was very fond of her, and to whom, in this short time, little Annette had grown very much attached. The good couple were childless, and, though Pierre took less notice of the child, he was not the less attracted to her, and showed his affection in many quiet ways.           / "Well, the lady, had her way, and the predic- tions of the guide and Lestroc were fulfilled; a frightful storm came up, and neither the lady or her brother returned." "Horrible!" exclaimed the Earl; " poor ,  NMortimer!" "Did you know him, sir?" asked the priest. "Yes ; finish your story, Father, and I will tell you one that will explain much that is strange to you."   202    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "I have not much more to tell. The storm was a frightful one, the most severe and fright- ful for many years ; trees were torn .up by their roots and hurled down the ravines and gullies of the mountain; the streams were swollen to three times their natural size, and rushed down their courses, carrying everything before them.  Neither the lady or her brother, the guide, or mule ever were seen again alive; their bodies were rescued after the storm had abated, and allowed a search to be made, which lasted several days before it was successful. "The grief of the little girl was frightful to see, and lasted a long time, but gradually yielded to the buoyancy of youth. The Les- trocs looked over the papers left behind, but could find no clue to any friends the child might have, nor was there any address by which they might be reached; no old letters-- nothing but a few pages in the lady's hand- writing addressed to the child. "These pages told a sad story of cruelty and harshness, and seemed to be a sort of apology to the child for bringing her away from home, and a justification of the step she had taken. The letter had been written at different times,   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     203 and sometimes with great effort, seemingly. "The linen was marked with a crest, as I told you, and the -initials, A M.P., and the little girl, when asked her name, replied An- nette Penen, which was evidently the nearest approach her baby lips could mak-e to the proper pronounciation.  The case was laid be- fore the authorities in Martigny, and every effort made to find the child's relations, in vain. '"After a while she grew more reconciled to her loss, and was the same merry, light-hearted darling she had been before.  Her mother's effects were all put carefully away, and Les- troc's wife took every possible care of the child, and soon became most sincerely attached to the little thing.  There was found quite a good sum of money, besides bills of exchange, on Viemna and Paris, to a large amount in the gentleman's trunk, and this was put aside for Annette's future, by the kind peasants. "For three years the child lived at home with these kind people, and in my periodical visits to the neighborhood, I gave what time I could to her instruction, and she was an apt scholar. ij    Then, at the end of three years they put her ill I-             204    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. the convent at Martigny, with the good ladies of the Sacred Heart, and under their care and guidance she remained five years. At the end of that time she returned to the farm, and her foster-mother then gave her the papers and clothing her mother had left; and they also gave her a full account of the money they had spent for her, and how much still remained. "But Annette preferred to wear the usual dress of the peasants of the Vallais, the only difference being, that her clothes were of a finer texture, and worn with a certain air that was natural to the child, but which those who en- vied her called haughtiness and pride. For the last four years she has devoted herself to her fos- ter-parents, and seems perfectly happy; her fos- ter-parents are most devotedly attached to her. "Such, my friends, is Annette's sad story. I called it sad, but the sadness seems all gone from her life now, may it never return to it!" said the old man earnestly, as he brought his narra- tive to a close. "Amen!" answered the Earl emphatically; "it never will, if I can prevent it, and I think what I, in my turn have to tell, will add much to her happiness."    "I sincerely hope it will, my son, what is it you have to add?" ' My father knew Annette's father inti- mately, he was always a moody, misanthropic man, and every one was electrified when the narriage of the Viscount Penryhn to Miss An- nette Mortimer, was announced. "Annette anal tHarry Mortimer were orphan brother and sister, the last of their name and line; and the devotion and love between them was great, much greater than in these days we see displayed in that relationship. 'Well, the marriage took place and all went smoothly for awhile, and the Viscountess Penryhn was pre- sented at court, and shone in every drawing room in London. She seemed devotedly at- tached to her husband, but he was much older than she, and, evidently, mingled with her love was a dread of offending him; and a reference was made to him, whenever anything occurred in which she was expected to take part. Her brother was constantly with her, and seemed just as anxious for his sister's hap- piness and comfort as before her marriage. "So things went on, till afterwhile sinister whispers spread through society that the Visr 17   206    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. count's misanthropic temper was shown to his young wife, to a cruel extent. Her child was born, and after that she withdrew almost en- tirely from society, but still the rumors grew, and were strengthened by Mortimer's growing avoidance of society and friends, and his taci- turnity and sadness. BDesides, the brothers-in- law were hardly on speaking terms, and avoided each other as much as possible. 1c This lasted till they had been married seven years, and then the report rang through society that the Viscountess Penryhn had left her hus- band and England. "You may imagine the excitement this caused, and wonderful stories were circulated as to the reason. Mortimer had disappeared too, and it was supposed he had accompanied his sister. 'i Of course, another companion was assigned her, and scandal tried to touch her fair fame. But this attempt failed, for the lady had borne herself spotless before the world, and no one could attribute a wrong thought or action to her. "At first, Penryhn shut himself up and would see no one; months passed, and then my father forced himself into his presence and found him almost a maniac.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     207 "Remorse had so worked upon him that he was ready to accuse himself of the murder of his wife, and of any other crime. My father had great trouble to arouse him out of this state, and never did fully succeed; but it was a relief, after his solitude was once broken in upon, to have some one to talk to; and gradu- ally he gave my father a full account of his jealousy, and, as he termed it, brutality, to his wife. The poor lady must have had enough to bear, if only one-half of his story was true. "He took means to find out whare she lared gone, but Mortimer had made his arrangements so cleverly that no trace of them. could be found: and after a few weeks of effort, a garbled account of the storm, of which the good Father has just told us, -reached England, but the child was included among the victims, and the account was so well authenticated, that Pen- ryhn gave up all further search." "Is he still living?" asked the Pere. "Yes, he is living, and completely changed; no one who had known him before, and met him now, after a long separation, would recog- nize him as the same man. Unceasing regret for the cruelty that drove his wife from him;    Ii    208    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. a ceaseless yearning for some object for which to live, for some human being upon whose affection he can rely, and upon whom he can lavish the long pent lip feelings of his heart, seems to take the place of'the old misanthropic cynicism." "Wil you write to him?" asked the priest. "Indeed, will I! and I am much mistaken if my letter does not bring him here as quickly as steam can do it." During all this time Montrose had not said one word, and when the priest and the Earl rose to re-enter the chalet, he remained where he had listened to the story, lost in sad and painful thought. All through the recitals of both, Gertrude had been present to his mind, and he tried to imagine what her feelings had been during all these years. Perhaps she would refuse ever to see him again-perhaps even if he were to humble himself to the dust before her now, she would scornhim-and as these thoughts arose, with them came a longing to see her again, and a strange pain at his heart when he thought that perhaps they would never meet more.

This letter Chester showed to Pere Andres, as also to Pierre Lestroe, and then they gave him permission to speak to Annette. The girl did not at first overcome her timidity, and for a long time took refuge in the society of her foster-mother whenever the Earl approached her. He was not disheartened,  however, and sought every means of attracting her attention, and of showing her every kindness in his power. On the  erie -or two occasions when he found imAndrelf as alone  to h er he strove, by every himself alone witi her, he strove, by every   i 210    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. possible courtesy and gentleness, to win a smile or bright glance from her. In time, his patience and perseverance was rewarded, and gradually she seemed to take pleasure in his society, and to miss it when he was away. The stranger who was the cause of their detention was nearly well, and the three friends frequently made excursions into Martigny, where the Earl's servant still remained with his master's and his friends' effects, or into the country around, or up and down the mountain. The chalet was not very far up the moun- tain; the grazing ground considerably-higher. They went up there with Annette and her mother; they visited the echo cave, and were shown the spot where it was supposed the ad- venturers had lost their lives. At last came Penryhn's letter, and Chester managed to way- lay Annette that evening, and tell her of her father. She was going up the Alps, and he joined her, saying, as she turned her bright face up to him: "Let us rest on yonder rock, Annette; I have something very particular to say to you."    THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     2" The child opened her large eyes at him in amazement, and then, seeing ho'w serious and quiet he was, she obeyed him silently. He had been told that Annette remembered her mother; he now asked her rather abruptly, if she also remembered her father. "My father!" she put both hands over her face, but not before Chester. had seen the shrinking dread in it, and her slight frame shook for a few moments with the intensity of her emotions. "I see you do, Annette, remember him; as, perhaps, you had good cause to " "tie killed mama! he killed manma!" she replied, sobbing. "Will you not believe him repentant, An- nette? Listen, and I will tell you of all his years of remorse and penitence. Then he told her all he knew, and when he had finished, added: "Now, when he comes, as he will in a day or so, you will greet him as a child would a long lost parent; you will soothe his broken heart with a daughter's love, and win him back to happiness?"  !   212    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Annette's sobs were her only answer. At length she looked up and said: "You are very kind, Mr. Durant; but I can't bear to think of it yet; give me till to- morrow; he-he is not coming so soon?" "Poor child! do you, indeed, dread seeing him! But he is very, very much changed, and you need have no fears." "Leave me now, please," she said, with a gesture of dismissal of her hand; you are very kind, but I -wish to be alone." "' I will leave you, but remember what he has suffered, and that he is your father." Saying which, the Earl turned away, and in a few mo- iments rejoined Montrose. Maynard had left them that morning. The secret of Annette's parentage had been kept from him, and, as his patient was on the high road to recovery, he was no longer needed, and had no particular wish to stay, as many en- gagements were waiting him at home. Lord Rockafellar was in London again, and of the merry party that had started on the pleasure trip, all but Montrose and the Earl meet at "The Blues " in September. The next morning Chester made his arrange-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    213 ments to go to Martigny, and when he was nearly ready to start, Annette and her foster- mother joined him. They would go with him, and wait the coming of Annette's father in the town. They did not wait long; the next day he ar- rived. We will not describe the meeting between father and child; over such scenes it is well to draw a veil; suffice it that the reconcilliation was complete, and the only drawhack 'to Annette's happiness was the thought that this finding of new ties necessitated the breaking of the old ones, for she loved the peasant couple very dearly. Madam Lestroc took Annette in her arms, when they were alone together, and shed over her a few sorrowful tears, but after that she seemed striving to mlake up her mind to support this trial with resignation. On the evening of the third day, they re- turned with Lord Penryhn to the chalet. During their absence, Montrose had been left much alone with Donaldson, which was the stranger's name, Lestroc being busy on the Alp. The second evening they were sitting on the rock, watching the sun set, or rather Montrose     214    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. I was half sitting, half lounging, Donaldson was reclining on a couch of pillows, plaids, and one or two bed quilts from the cottage. The even- ing air was growing quite cool, and Montrose rose and adjusted a shawl over the invalid, who looked up at him and said: ".Oh! Beresford, how can I thank you for your devotion-did you obtain your knowledge of nursing from your wife?" "My wife!"Montrose's face grew dark and stern. "What do you know of my wife?" "Much that I have longed to tell you, and yet feared, being a stranger, to intrude' upon so delicate a subject--pardon me that I did so inadvertently."' IIis face flushed, and his hand trembled, but hie watched Montrose's face eagerly. In Heaven's name, tell me what you mean -how did you know I had a wife--where did you ever see her?" "You know how I puzzled over your face when you first came? At last the place and time when I had seen you previously came to me. You were in the hospital at 5Washington, "Lincoln Hospital," during the summer of '62, do you remember?     THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    215 Remember? small need to ask that! "'Yes, but you were not there." "Pardon me, I was; my bed was next to yours. I saw your wife come, she stood at your side and bathed your face and hands with her tears. She. had you removed to another building, and a few days after the sisters found I was so very ill, they gave me a room in the same building, communicating with that in which you were by a door, that was sometimes left open for greater air. I was near dying, but perfectly conscious, and gradually became fascinated in watching your wife's untiring devotion and care." Montrose drew his hand from Donaldson's grasp, and folding his arms on his knees rested his head on them. B "Her sister, (the relationship, and much that I am telling you, I learned afterwards), one of the order, came frequently to her relief, but she was only away from your bedside a few mo- ments at a time. You were never conscious, and talked much about "Helen", and your mother; she seemed to watch for something more-some word, that you never uttered. One night they thought I was asleep, and left the    i it'j  I  216    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. door open; she was alone with you, and seemed more depressed and troubled than she had been before. They had told her, your mind might never recover its tone, you might be a maniac or idiotic all your life. That night she gave full expression to her feelings, and prayed for you and for herself. One portion of her prayer (you must forgive me for alluding to what, of course, is sacred between yourselves) " "Go on-go on!" said Montrose, without changing his position. "One portion of her prayer was, that your heart might be softened, that her great love for you might awaken some little response in your breast, and that if you recovered, there might be yet some few years of happiness in store for her." Montrose buried his face in his hands, but said nothing. "The next day you grew so violent her life was not safe with you, and she was obliged to resign you to the care of two strong men. Then she devoted herself to me, but often did she stop at the closed door between the rooms and put her ear close to the crack to listen. "Then they sent for her to return toher father,   -and afterwards her sister joined her. She was taken ill herself I heard, and her sister re- mained to nurse her. Meantime, you recov- ered and left the hospital, and I supposed you went to your wife. We never met again, till I saw you sitting at my bedside, two months ago." Donaldson ceased, but still Montrose never moved. At last, after a long silence, he raised his head, and his face was very pale. 'N Why did you not tell me this before?" "Because I never heard you mention your wife's name-how could I? My mention of her this evening, was the result of a moment's thoughtlessness."  '"True! true! Oh! how blind and cruel I have been, my poor, poor Gertrude!" "' I am glad I have told you, B1resford, for it would have worried me, had we parted, and this explanation not occurred, for I guessed, by your silence about your wife, coupled with what I saw, that all was not right." "Yes, yes, I am glad too! But I must be alone for awhile;" and wringing his compan- ion's hand, he sprang up and walked some dis- tance away, then threw himself full length upon the ground, and buried his face in his folded 18   218    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. arms again. Presently, strong sobs shook his frame, and tears swelled up into his eyes, and relieved his over-burdened heart. It was late in the evening, before Montrose returned to the chalet, and Donaldson was al- ready asleep. Sleep, however, was a stranger to Montrose's eyes, and he spent the night pac- ing the plateau. Early in the morning, he wrote a long letter to Gertrude, and asked Lestroc to send it to Martigny by his herdsman, which the peasant was willing to do, and Montrose gave the man great charges to post the letter safely. He could not leave Donaldson to go himself, and could not wait for the return of Chester, before writing. His letter sent, he spent the day in restless anxiety and eager watching for the Earl's return. -J   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     219 CH APTER XX V 11. I do not shame To tell you what I was, since my conversion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am!" OWARDS evening, to Montrose's great de- light, Chester and the rest returned. They were accompanied by a tall, dark- looking man, whom Montrose knew at once to be Lord Penryhn. After an introduction, Mon- trose noticed what a careworn, anxious look the Viscount's refined, but not handsome, fea- tures wore, and how loath he was to have Annette out of his sight a moment. The girl was very shy and quiet, submitting to her father's caresses, but not returning them. They had been all day corning the distance from Martigny, stopping at Visp and Zerlatt; and Chester told Montrose in gay, good humor, that the next day was fixed for an excursion to the pass of the great St. Bernard; mules and   220    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. guides were to meet them at Zerlatt, and a chair was to be brought up to the chalet for Donald- son. The Earl was so happy in his anticipations of the future, that he had not noticed the change in Montrose, and was taken completely by sur- prise, when the latter told him of his intended departure the next day for England, thence for America. "What has brought you to this sudden de- termination, Montrose?-you had no such idea when I left you three days ago." "No; I have had a strange revelation since then, and feel as if I could fly home on the wings of the wind." The two friends were pacing up and down the plateau, in the lovely twilight, smoking, when the above colloquy took place. Montrose continued, taking his companion's arm: "Let us descend to the recess a-t the foot of this path, where Annette rescued us; I have much to say, much to explain, and we will be unin- terrupted there." "Well, now tell me why this sudden re- solve?" said the Earl, as they lounged upon the- rocky floor of the recess. "This is rather a   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     221 hard seat though, Montrose, and rather close quarters for long-limbed animals like us!"  "Never mind that; I could think of no other place where we would be safe from interrup- tion. You have, doubtless, often wondered why I never spoke of Ger-of my wife?" "Well, I must confess, I have often won- dered what the trouble -was: there was some, somewhere, I knew." Then Montrose told him all: of the strange circumstances under which he was married, and all that had happened since; he did not spare himself a particle; for he saw his conduct in its true light. After his story was finished, the two smoked, in silence, for a while, and then Montrose con- tinued: "I must get home now, as fast as steam can take me, Chester; I feel as if I ought not to sleep or breathe, till I can see Gertrude, and ask her forgiveness." "I do not wonder, my dear fellow: it is a most singular and romantic story, and you have my best wishes for your future happiness. Of course, you must get home as fast as possi- ble; and in the thought of your joy, I will try   222     THE MONARGES LEGACY. and forget the disappointment, that you will not be our companion longer." "Don't let me be selfish, Chester; tell me how Annette met her father, and of your own plans." "The child was shy enough, and seemed still to be afraid of him; but Penryhn is so changed, so gentle and affectionate, that he will soon win her affections." "Does she know your rank yet?" "No: I told Penryhn, I wished to preserve my incognito a little while longer." "Why, now?" "Oh! just a fancy I have, to see if I can win her affection in my simple person, without the attraction of my coronet." "Well, I wish you success. But what ar- rangements have been made, you cannot re- main here any longer?" "No; we all go down to the farm the day after to-morrow. Penryhn will not take An- -nette away from her foster-parents, till she becomes more used to the idea, and learns to know him better. But he is most anxious to see her in a dress befitting her rank; so the mules have been ordered for to-morrow, to   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    223 take us back to Martiginy, where, Penrybhn says, he met a lady whom he knows very well, and whom he can ask to superintend the selec- tion of a suitable wardrobe for the present. This is a fortunate arrangement; for you can ride one of the guides' mules, and go with us." "Yes, so I can; and now let us return to our friends, and spend our last evening merrily as we can." While they had been talking, the twilight had deepened into night, and they scrambled, rather than climbed, up the steep ascent. lWhen they arrived at the chalet, they found the rest quite anxious to know what had be- come of them, and quite relieved at their re- appearance. It was a lovely moonlight night, and, though cool enough to render shawls and plaids neces- sary, it was not too cool to sit out in the air, and they enjoyed it accordingly. They were all there but Pierre Lestroc and his wife, who were busy in the chalet, and who seldom joined their visitors, as they could hold but little com- munication, except through Annette's interpre- tation. "It is a pity you cannot read Byron in the   224    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. original, mademoiselle," said Montrose to An- nette. "How do you know I cannot?" she an- swered, with -a quiet smile, in perfectly good English, though with a slight accent. "Do you speak English!" and "Why did you not do so before?" were their astonished exclamations. "Simply because you always spoke French to me; and-and-I never cared much to speak English." ti Strange! Yes, I remember we took it for granted that you spoke only French." 'i You forget I was for many years a pupil at the convent of Notre Dame du Sacre Coeur; my kind foster-parents never forgot that one day I might recover my lost name;" her voice trembled. Lord Penryhn put his hand on her shoulder, and said gently: "They were, indeed, kind to my child." "Then, I supose, music was not neglected by the good Sisters?" asked Chester. " No, it was not." "Pardon me, but are you familiar at all with English literature?" asked Montrose.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     225 "e Oh, yes," she replied ; "I have read a great deal, particularly Thackeray and Byron." "Rather strange names to put together," laughed Chester; "how  did you like Thac- keray?" "Very much," replied Annette; but she suddenly became silent again, and evidently shrank from being talked to any more. They did not press her; but Lord Penryhn put his arm around her, and drew her close to - him. 4' Come, Montrose, can you not give us some- thing suitable to the time and place?" said Donaldson, who had not spoken before. "Yes, do, Montrose; it is a pleasure to listen to your recitations. If ever you lose your for- tune, and need a support, take to public read- ings and recitations; as it is, it's a pity so much talent should be wasted," "Thanks, Chester, for the suggestion; if there ever comes a necessity, I'll not forget it," replied Montrose. Then, after a short silence, he began as follows:- "Sweet moon! if, like Crotona's sage, By any spell my hand could dare To make thy disk it's ample page,   226     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. And write my thoughts, my wishes there; How many a friend, whose careless eye Now wanders o'er that starry sky, Should smile upon thy orb to meet The recollection, kind and meet- The reveries of fond regret- The promise never to forget- And all my heart and soul would send To many a dear-lov'd distant friend." Montrose's voice was naturally sweet, but the words suited so well his present state of mind, that neither Chester nor Donaldson were at a loss to understand the tlrilling tenderness in it, as he uttered the three last lines. In a few moments he began again- "Above me are the Alps, Those palaces of Nature, whole vast walls Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps, And throned Eternity in icy halls  Of cold sublimity, where forms and falls The avalanche-the thunderbolt of snow. All that expands the spirit, yet appals, Gather around these summits, as to show How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below."' "After all that is said of Browning and Tennyson, there are none equal to Moore and Byron in  soul poetry!" exclaimed   Chester; "we are under obligations to you, Beresford. ^                i   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     227 Can you not add to them by giving us just one song; "Adelaide" is just the one for the time and place; come, Montrose, there's a good fel- low." "Eh bien! as you will." And Montrose sang the soft, weird, German air that the words seem to suit so well, and his rich, mellow tenor rested with caressing tenderness on the oft-repeated  "Adelaide." All listened in wrapt silence, till the last note died away on the night; and then, to the sur- prise of all, Annette gave an hysterical cry, and threw herself on her father's breast, sob- bing convulsively. He tried to soothe her; and, after a while, succeeded, and thetn carried the poor child to her own room.  This broke up the party, and n a short time all were locked in the arms of sleep, with the quiet stars and everlasting hills for sentinels over their slumbers.   228    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER XXIX. "And must we meet, first, in a careless crowd?" ERTRUDE had not seen her husband for five years; he had not seen her for more than six, and in that time she had grown to be a woman, and had changed much. She had become really handsome. Not hand- some, to analyse her face, and take feature from feature; but the tout ensemble, with the crown- ing glory of her magnificent hair, was that of a, fine looking woman, almost beautiful under the influence of strong feeling. Her complex- ion, so uncertain in its flushes of red, or changes to a yellowish hue, had softened into a creamy white, just tinged by a delicate color in her cheeks; her mouth had always been an ugly feature with its colorless lips, but they vied with   THE MAONTARGES LEGACY.    229 the coral row, and when the pearly teeth were revealed, one forgot its rather inartistic width; her eyes had always been beautiful. There was munch, too, in Gertrude's face, be- yond and above mere beauty, and her womlan- hood had added a certain dignity to both face and carriage, softened by the untold sorrow, the unthought of grief that had clouded her young years. During the summer months spent by Mon- trose on Monte Rosa, Gertrude also, was among the mountains. At the hotel where she stayedl, she formed a warm and sincere friendship for a young married lady, whom se met thllere. Mrs. Norris lived in 1New York, and Gertrude prom- ised herself great pleasure in her society, the coming winter.  Nor was she disappointed. 'Hitherto, she had  shrunk from -  accepting the slightest attention from gentlemen, and had had many a warm. lover to ward off; without offence, or allowing him to put himself into the mortifling position of a rejected suitor. Now, lher intimacy with Mrs. Norris, enabled her to enjoy society, and she gradually allowed her- self more and more the indulgence of a pleasure, which had always been a great one with iher. 19   230    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. About the middle of October, Robert Norris returned frolm Vienna, and was, of course, dom- iciled with his brother and sister-in-law. He saw much of Gertrude, and was charmed with her; and it was most natural, in speaking of his European life, that he should mention the warm intimacy that had grown up between himself and Col. Beresford. The first tinme he men- tioned the name, Gertrude's face almost be- trayed her, but she was fortunately able to at- tribute her agitation to something other than its true cause, and, " forewarned, forearmed," did not suffer it to appear again. She was sur- prised, herself, at the calmness with which she heard of her husband's intended return. Ristori! What fascination in that name! What delight of pain and pleasure, does it not recall! Ristori was in New York, and all the world flocked to see her. She played Elizabeth, and the theatre was packed; those who came late, could with diffi- culty, reach their seats, and once there, it was next to impossible to leave them. Gertrude, with the Norrises, went early; con- sequently, as the house filled, they easily recog- nized their friends. But once the actress was   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     231 on the stage, Gertrude's whole attention was wrapt, absorbed; she saw nothing, heard noth- ing but the movements and words of the great enchantress. At t-he close of the first act, Ro- bert Norris leaned over her, and said: "You have heard me speak of my friend Col. Beres- ford-he must have just arrived to-day, for he is in the house, and I did not know he was in the country." Gertrude felt herself turning very pale, and, she trembled so, she feared to trust herself to speak, but was relieved to find Mr. Nlorris was so taken up watching his friend, that he had not more than glanced at her, when he first spoke. She readily followed his eye, and did not need to search long, ere her glance rested on the face that she had seen last wasted and worn by sickness and pain, on the small hospi- tal bed, at Washington. "Do you see that gentleman with the heavy, black, curling hair and singularly handsome face; seated near that third pillar? Ah! now he moves, raises his glass and looks around the house." "Yes, I see," replied Gertrude quietly, and she raised her own glass and fixed it upon him.   232    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "How provoling!" said Mrs. Norris; " that you can not reach him, Robert; it would be so pleasant to have him join us; but you may meet him as we leave the house; at any rate, you must bring him home with you to-nmorrow.") Meantime, Gertrude was watching him  as often as she was able, without attracting the attention of either Montrose, or her own party. iTot that the latter would have seen anything strange, ir her eyes being drawn in his direc- tion; but Gertrude's self-consciousness made her fearful, where often there was no necessity. She saw again the handsome face with its extreme beauty, improved and increased by the maturity of mnanhoold, and the intelligence and intellect which study andi travel had evoked. The delicate nmustache shaded, but did not hide the chiseled lips, he wore, no other beard; his hair was glossy and thick in its heavy curls, and, even as she looked, was thrown back with the careless gesture she knew so well.. Again the curtain rose and -all eyes were fixed' upon the stage, once or twice Gertrude ventured to glance towards Montrose, but he evidently had not yet seen Norris, nor been attracted towards their party.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      233 What her feelings were she could not have defined, but she was too nervous to enjoy any more the superb acting. Her attention was divided, and she could not help dreading that the next few days might bring a renewal of her former sorrows. The curtain fell once more, and then RoberLt INorris stood up in his anxiety to draw his friend's attention, and he succeeded. Gertrude saw the start, and slmiling bow of recognition, and her heart beat almost to suffocation as she saw him scan the party. She pretended to be busy with her fan, but, for the once, her very eyelids seemed transparent, and she was conscious, painfully so,.of the close scrutiny he gave his friend's companions. It was a relief to find he made no startling dis- covery. The glances he bestowed upon them revealed nothing beyond a natural curiosity as- to the friends of his friend. At length he raised his glasses, and after a sweeping survey of the house they rested for some monments on the party. There was no start of surprise, no flush of recognition, and as soon as she dared, Gertrude raised her own glass and was satisfied by the smile of simple   234    THE MBONTARGES LEGACY. pleasure and the expression of Montrose's face, that her secret was still safe. 'While Elizabeth was struggling with her love and anger; the urgency of her minister, and her anxiety for a message from Essex ere she put her name to the death sentence; all thought of even the present cause for anxiety was lost in the: scene of suffering so graphically portray- ed, and Gertrude, for a few moments, forgot all but the woman and her agony before her. At length the struggle is over, the curtain falls; and then Gertrude's heart beat fiercely as she nerved herself to meet whatever might be coming. It was as he had suggested it might be; thev were to meet as strangers, and it should not be by any effort of hers, that a recognition would be brought about. He evidently had not changed his mind about their present relation to each other, for not even Mr. Macgregor knew of his intended return, except as she herself had written to him what Robert Norris had told her. They would meet as strangers; as strangers they should remain, until he made the first advances towards a reconciliation. She had suffered more than perhaps was her share, and   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      235 as patiently as her nature would allow; she would expose herself to no more insults. Such were some of the thoughts that kept time to the careless words she addressed her companions, as they vzraited a chance to leave the theatre. Montrose was watching their movements, and managed to meet them at the door of the auditorium. It was not light enough to ob- serve closely, and, in the confusion, Gertrude's manner was .not noticed; but she trembled violently as Robert Norris introduced   his friend, Colonel Beresford. ITe spoke, some careless words, of course, but every tone thrilled through her: ' "'Twas his own voice-she could not err- Throughout the breathing world's extent, There was but one such voice for her,  So kind, so soft, so eloquent." At last she Nvas at home in her own room, and at liberty to indulge her feelings unchecked and unwatched; and, with a passion of tears, she flung herself upon her knees at her bedside, and buried her face in the pillow. How long she knelt there she did not know,; at length she retired but not to sleep, and with relief she saw the daylight break.   236    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. The next day, at Mrs. Norris' earnestly ex- pressed wish, Montrose re-moved from the hotel to her house, and soon found himself con- pletely at holme with the kind-hearted little woman. Gertrude received a visit from her friend the day after his instalment, and was told with great exultation of the prize she had secured. "Robert says the colonel is the most charm- ing companion! I have never known him to take such a fancy to any one as he has to lhim," said Mrs. Norris. "I do hope his being at our house will not frighten you away, my dear Miss Clayton, for I tlinlk you will like him-- you will like each other very well-at any rate, I hope you will." "Oh, I dare say we will," said Gertrude, calmly. "4 You seem very indifferent on the subject, my dear," continued her friend ; " take care, or you will be caught at last. I don't believe even your sang froid will last after once exposed to the charming colonel's fascinations. [Now, tell me, didn't you think him handsome?" "Most decidedly so," answered Gertrude, em- phatically enough to satisfy even Mrs. Norris.   THE MONTARGES' LEGACY.    237 '"Well, when I tell you that he is as intelli- gent as he is handsome, and as kind-hearted and gentle as he is intelligent; what will you say then?" "That you are rather jumping to conclu- sions, my dear; how do you know all this, after only a few hours' intercourse?" "Oh! I judge mostly from what Bob has told me, and from his face; you may depend, he is all I have said he is!" "May be he is," said Gertrude, with a sigh. She remembered the hard, cruel expression the handsome face had borne towards her, many a time and oft; the cruel, bitter words the chis- elled lips had uttered; and the neglect and suffering she had experienced from this gentle gentleman,-this ' admirable Crichton' of Mrs. Norris' imagination! But no trace of her thoughts escaped through lip or eye, and she said, laughingly: "I confess I have not lost my heart, as common phrase has it, with your brother's friend; but I am very willing to learn to think as highly of him as you do, if he will allow me." "Well, I am  glad you condescend even so little; I am going to bring you to the test   238    THE MONTARGES' LEGACY., soon: for I shall bring him round in an evening or two, and introduce you to his fascinations. He asked who you were." '"Did he?" asked Gertrude, betrayed by her dread of discovery, into an appearance of anxi- ety she was sorry for: for Mrs. Norris replied, teazingly: "Did he? Ah! I thought my Diana would not be callous to a little flattery; you are hu- man after all! Yes, he did ask who you were, and said  -" What he said was checked on the speaker's lips, by the entrance of other visitors, and in a few moments Mrs. Norris took her leave. How often careless words are as barbed ar- rows to the wounded heart. "' You are human after all!"Though the words were said en badinage, they sank with pain into Gertrude's memory. Was she not human? had she not suffered in both the sacred relations of wife and daughter? Aye, what human heart more? If the baptism of sorrow would make her hu- man, she had full claim to the title,   THE MONTARGES' LEGACY.     239 CHAPTER XXX. "Oft expectation fails, and most oft there, Where most it promises."  EsN his arrival in New York, Montrose had eagerly inquired for letters; there was one, and only one, awaiting him; it was from Macgregor, and contained no mention of Gertrude. Bearing, as well as he could, this disappointment, he still looked for the next day's mail, but with the same result. This, to Montrose, in his present state of mind, was a severe trial; he had thought of the possibility of Gertrude's not replying to his letter, but he could not bring himself to believe that she really would remain silent. He had returned anxious, in all sincerity, to redeem the past, and show in the future that   240    THE MONTARGES' LEGACY. his love for his wife was none the less true that it had been evoked so late, and under such cir- cumstances. Hie came prepared to meet blame, and to answer it, and to allow no scornful or angry words from Gertrude to prevent him from a great effort to prove his sincerity. But this silence was difficult to deal with, and he knew not what to do. He shrank from going to Philadelphia, and meeting old friends and their questions; he felt that, in his present state of mind, he could not bear it. For the same reasons, he avoided going out as much as possible, particularly into the lower part of the city, where there was danger of meeting those Philadelphians who were in in the habit of visiting the metropolis on business or pleasure. So he wrote to Macgregor, stated how anxious he was to see his wife; that he had written to her to that effect, and had received no answer. "Would Macgregor give him her present address, or inquire if his letter reached Gertrude? he had addressed it to his, Macgregor's, care. This letter, unfortunately, was written a day after Macgregor had left Philadelphia, for a several weeks' tour through the mining districts of   THE MONTARGES' LEGACY.    241. Pennsylvania; and as he expected not to be longer than a day in any one place, had directed that his correspondence should not be sent to him, until he wrote for it. Montrose's letter, consequently, laid on the lawyer's office table ten days. Mr. and Mrs. Norris, desirous to show every attention in their power to their brother's friend, invited a "select few," to meet him two evenings after his arrival. It was with no pleasant feelings, or anticipa- tions of enjoyment, that he heard of this pro- posed company. He had accepted the invitation so kindly urged, to make their house his home during his stay, with the conviction that it would only be for a few days,; that before a week, he would hear from Gertrude, or through Macgregor of her. Consequently, it was with an anxious heart and a mlind little attuned to gaiety, that he found himself in Mrs. Norris' brilliantly-lighted drawing-room. Not so, Gertrude. No youthful debutante, upon the boards of fashion, ever yearned for her first party, as did Gertrude for that evening. She hardly knew how the day, after receiving 20   242    THE MONTARGES' LEGACY. Mrs. Norris' note of invitation, passed; and Mrs. Clayton and Margaret wondered at ,the strange, restless spirit that had taken" posses- sion of her. She wandered up and down stairs, in and out of the rooms, and gave such contra- dictory directions to the dress-maker who was arranging her dress, that the poor thing was at a loss what to do. The next day she grew suddenly quiet, and spent the greater part of the morning in her own room, not allowing any one to enter. After dinner, when the time came for her toilet, she grew nervous again, and the hair-dresser said he '"nevaire did know mademoiselle to be so difficile,--yat you say-hard to please-be- fore!" But at length the trial was over, and Ger- trude stood arrayed to her satisfaction. Hand- somely as she had always dressed; for her love for the beautiful led her to study it in all things, she strove, on this occasions to make her toilet as perfect as it was possible to be. Again they met, and in the full light of th(e brilliant room they looked into each other's faces. He, with the calm courtesy of a stran ger; she, with every nerve and muscle quiver   THE MONTARGEST LEGACY.    243 ing, yet restrained by an effort of will that taxed all her strength, and rendered her cold, haughty and distant. She looked into the handsome face, glowing with health and beauty, and then she remem- bered the same face, as it had bid her good-bye so carelessly, nearly seven years before; as she had seen it tossing on a bed of pain. She saw all this as she met his eye in returning his bow, and she saw  too, it was as he had pre-sup- posed-they met as strangers. Gertrude's feelings, when she found that Mon- trose really did not recognize her, were a mix- ture difficult to describe, She felt relieved for the present; pained that he should still remain indifferent; and with all a kind of pleasure, that the change in. her own personal appearance was so great, for great it must be, if he could see no trace of Gertrude Montarges in Miss Clayton; but, above all, she felt that her love for him was as strong as ever, spite of her determination to root it out of her heart, and the wounded pride that had induced her to withdraw herself from all chance of meeting him, as she thought, had not died in all these years. It was as strong in her heart yet, and she resolved to   244    THE MONTARGES' LEGACY. reveal herself by no slightest word or look. If he wished for no reconciliation she was willing to abide by his decision. Montrose did not dance, but saunterede idly through the rooms, and at length came up behind her chair, as she sat turning over a book of photographs, which Robert Norris, like all modern travellers, had brought home with him. "Htave you ever been to Europe, Miss Clay- ton?"The suddenness of the question almost put her off her guard, but she answered: :"No." Her tone was low, she was fearful her voice would prove traitor, his thrilled every nerve in her frame in spite of herself. For the moment, too, she had forgotten her short trip to England. "Ah, then you have a great delight in store," he said, turning over the pictures. They were all places with which he was familiar, and he had something to say of each; fortunately Gertrude did not feel obliged to, utter more than monosyllables. She listened to the voice for which her ears had yearned so often; she saw the hands so white and shapely, for whose pressure her own had longed so many, many times; sometimes   THE MONTARGES' LEGACY.    245 she would steal a glance at the face-the smile, the glance of the eye, for which her very soul had sickened, they were all there, and she wondered how she could resist the wild impulse to thrlow her arms around him and call him, a Montrose, husband!" But she sat there a graceful listener, a model of propriety, and no one knew how wildly her heart was beating, bow between the pictures he held up for her inspection ever floated others, not the less distinct that they were limned by memory's pencil. "You seem to have enjoyed your travels so much, I wonder you could tear yourself away from these scenes, and return to our humdrum country, which, now the war is over, seems to have gone to sleep again," said Gertrude, after he had turned over many of the pictures, feel- ing called upon to make some effort, ' however, I suppose you had stronger ties this side of the water." . She watched his face as he answered. "to, nothing brought me home but an unac- countable, 'meal du pays,'--'Heimweh,' I ought to call it, for it came over me among the German Alps. Miss Clayton, are not a man's friends bound to assist him, in his good intentions?"   246    THE MONTARGES9 LEGACY. "Most assuredly--why do you ask?" "Miss Clayton!"MArs. NTorris came up at the moment, " some- of your admirers are in the music-room, and sent me to inform  you the piano waits-will you come?" "Certainly, my dear Mrs. Norris ;"Gertrude rove immediately; she was always ready to oblige her friends, but, just now, she would have liked to have been allowed to finish the conver- sation, and she could not help wondering if the "good resolutions " had any reference to her. MTontrose offered his arm; she rested her hand on it but slightly, she feared he would notice how she trembled. NTever had she sung so wonderfully, before. She never refused, when asked; but to-night, she sang with a purpose, and poured forth her voice in such a tide of melody, that those who had heard her before, were electrified. Song followed song, and, at last, some one asked for that passionate outhurst of a despairing heart, the "Robert toi que j'aime." Gertrude hesi- tated a moment; she feared her feelings would betray her, for she always sang .that with a thought of him. But she decided to essay it, and did so; every   THE M1ONTABGES' LEGACY.   247 one knows the wild despairing music, the be- seeching words. She gave both full expression and when she ceased, the silence was praise greater than words could speak. As she arose from the instrument and gath- ered up her gloves and handkerchief, she met Montrose's eyes fixed upon her ;he was leaning, with folded arms, against the jamb of the door, and seemed lost in thought. The evening drew to a close at last, and Ger- trude was glad when the strain was over. Reaching her own room, and sending Marga- ret away, she turned both gas burners full on, and stood, for some while, contemplating the face before her. She looked almost beautiful, under the excitement that had lent a brighter light to her eyes, a deeper glow to her cheek. "Am-I, indeed, so changed that my husband does not know me! Can it be, and may he not learn to love me yet? BIut I must not allow that, that must not be; as Miss Clayton, I must ever be a stranger to him-he to me. I must shield myself behind a haughty pride, that will keep him at a distance, and let my Nweary heart ache on until the end--ah me, ah me!" Her face sank on her hands, and tears tric-   248    THE MONTARGES' LEGACY. kled between her fingers; for the first time, she began to doubt her wisdom in taking counsel with her pride, and changing her name and res- idence. Certainly, meeting him thus had never been one of her anticipations! 9^     .'   THE MONTARGES) LEGACY.    249 CHTAPTER  XXXI. "Here are some of the unpleasantest words That ever blotted paper." ,BS ONTROSE had not been in a state of mind to think or care much for his surround- ings, and had hardly noticed Gertrude, that evening, till the photographs attracted him; and he turned them over more potur passer les temps, than anything else, and had drifted into the more serious conversation almost uncon- sciously, his mind being full of the subject. But when she sang, her voice stirred the very depths of his being, and he longed to know more of the singer. Accordingly, the next day, he asked Mrs. Norris to go with him to see Miss Clayton in   250    THE MONTARGES' LEGACY. her own house. In the meantime, not hearing from Macgregor, and Gertrude still preserving her irritating silence, he was alike angry and unhappy; and determined, in the morning, after every disappointment, to leave the country again-a resolution broken at night by the hope that the next day would bring him better fortune. This state of mind made him appear far other, than the brilliant, pleasant companion Robert Norris had represented him to be. He was moody and depressed at times, at others extravagantly gay-altogether a mystery, alike to the old friends as to the new ones. The morning after his visit to Gertrude, being the fourth since his arrival, he decided to take the ten o'clock train for Philadelphia, to see- Macgregor and have some satisfaction; returning to New York that night. On entering Macgregor's office, he was told by the clerk that only that morning, he, by Mr. Macgregor's orders, had forwarded a number of letters to him at Pottstown, where he would stay long enough to, receive them, the first that he, the clerk, had been able to send since Mr. Macgregor had left.   THE MONTARGES' LEGACY.    251 Would Mr. Macgregor be long enough in Pottstown for Montrose to find him there, if he started in the next train? The clerk did not know-did not think it likely-he might or he might not. So Mon- trose returned to Neew York, to await an an- swer to his letter, being sure now that he would receive oneo It came. Macgregor had heard from Gertrude of Mon- trose's arrival; of their meeting and his failing to recognise her. She wrote some bitter words, prompted by her wounded love and pride, and ended her letter by saying: "she believed she had become so used to her present life that she would not care to change it." With this letter from Gertrude, Maegregor could give Montrose no favorable answer until he heard again from her, and his reply to him was so guarded as to be very cold; and rather intimated that Gertrude would listen to no efforts at reconciliation. Macgregor had only time to pen a few hur- ried lines to this effect to Montrose, promising to write more fully on his return to the city.

"So! I have sinned beyond forgiveness, have I, Gertrude; thus let it be, then; I will make no further effort." Montrose's lips closed over his mouth tightly, as he tore the letter to shreds and dashed them to the floor. Then he sank back into his chair - with a laughing demon in his sneer," and for the time, all hard, unkind, and some wicked thoughts crowded into his mind. Presently he seized his hat and left the house, and, before he knew it, was standing at Miss Clayton's steps, and had pulled the bell. Gertrude received him, the first visit he had paid her by himself, pleasantly, but with a cer- tain reserve in her manner, that he had not no- ticed when in her presencebefore, and which puzzled and provoked him. He had sought her unconsciously, but in obedience to a train of thought that had been in his mind since he last saw her. Miss Clay- ton pleased him more than any woman he had ever met, and her superb contralto had com-   THE MONTARGES' LEGACY.    253 pletely fascinated him. So, naturally, he had thought much of her, and had come in his first impulse of distress to be soothed by her plea- sant society. But Gertrude could not divine what was passing in his mind. She only knew she had received no word from him, for nearly five years; that he had returned, and had made no effort to see her; that he only knew her as Miss Clayton, and most naturally the conclusion she arrived- at was, that he was still indifferent to his wife. Therefore; she could not be gracious, or more than just necessarily polite; and he saw, before he had been with her fifteen minutes, that there was an icy wall of reserve about her, that he could not scale. Vexed and disappointed on all sides, he an- nounced that evening at the dinner table that he meant to sail for'Europe again, in the next steamer. "Only a week in the country, and anxious to be gone again!" exclaimed Mrs. Norris. "That is not to be thought of, my dear fel- low," said Robert Norris. "Not till after Christmas, at least," said Mrs. 21   254    THE MONTARGES.' LEGACY. Norris, "I have a plan for the holidays, if I can get Dolores Clayton to accede to it!"i' "Dolores! is that Miss Clayton's name?" he asked. "Yes, isn't it an odd one?" "Not in Spain; but I did not know Miss Clayton had Spanish blood in her." "Neither has she-her family are English and American, I believe." "Dolores,-'tis a pretty soft name--its owner does not correspond--" "Don't you think Miss Clayton handsome?" asked Mrs. Norris, quickly. "Yes, she is a very handsome-icicle." "Oh! Colonel Beresford!" "Perhaps it is only I who suffer, but I con- fess to having failed to melt her." "'Nil desperandum,' should be your motto Colonel," said Harry Norris. "Oh it is not a matter of such importance, that I should care. It will not break my heart to find Miss Clayton, as hard to move as Diana of the Ephesians." But Kate Norris, with all a woman's love for match making fancied she noticed a tone of pique in the Colonel's voice, that gave the lie to   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     255 his careless words; and she immediately began to plan throwing them more intimately to- gether. Montrose did not go to Europe. He promised the Norrises to remain till after Christmas, and glad to have his mind made up for him, he let himself drift through the days in passive idleness, and some strange fascination seemed ever to draw him to Miss Clayton's side. She was not blind to the influence she was acquiring over him, and it distressed, while it pleased her; but not one jot did she unbend from the course she had laid out for herself. Macgregor was taken ill at Scranton before he had time to write to Gertrude in relation to Montrose's letter, and as it was some .three weeks before he was able to attend to any bus- iness, she was still left to her own resources. The weeks passed on leaden wings to both Gertrude and Montrose. She, anxious to know how the affair would end-he, awaited eagerly Mr. Macgregor's promised letter.   '256    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHTAPTER  XXX li. "In many ways does the full heart reveal The presence of the love it would conceal." S  HE Christmas times came, and Montrose was free to leave for Europe; but now he had no desire to go. "I may as well stay here, among my friends, as banish myself, when I could not be more separated om Gertrude were the ocean be- tween us." He had, owing 'to the intimacy between the families, seen much of Gertrude, or, rather, Miss Clayton, in these last three weeks, and had many opportunities of watching her face, a study of which he was particularly fond.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     257 First, a faint, dim, misty resemblance, or, rather, a familiarity with her features at- tracted him, and the resemblance grew and fixed itself in his mind, and still he could not place it. On this account, it occupied him still more than it would have done, and at length the solution came to him. "I have made up my mind--set my heart upon it, Dolores-you must have a tableaux party; your i ooms are just the place for one, particularly if you open that end room that you keep guarded so closely." Gertrude colored violently, and look!ed more like her former self than she had done for years. Montrose had looked at her to speak, and she saw him start and gaze closely at her for an instant; it was not an impertinent stare, but the iris of his eyes closed over the pupil a fraction of an instant. "Do you know, Colonel," Kate -Norris con- tinued, "Miss Clayton has a 'sanctum sancto- rum' behind that jealously closed door, at the end of the drawing room, that few enter; let us force the doors some day, and explore the sacred soil.'" "You would find little to pay you for your   258    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. trouble," said Gertrude, really annoyed at the turn the conversation had taken. "But about the tableaux; will you agree to my wishes?" "I see no reason why I should not," replied Gertrude," and the mysterious chamber shall be at your service." "Now you are a trump, Dolores 1" cried the delighted little woman, kissing her friend. "By Jove! I have it at last!" exclaimed Montrose, as he found himself alone in his own room. "She looks like Gertrude 1! that is the solution of the puzzle; and strange that I did not see it before! She looks like my--like Ger- trude; has the same hair and eyes, and the same trick of flashing her eyes full upon you, as Ger- trude had; she looked particularly like her when she colored so furiously at Mrs. Norris' question. I wonder why it is she keeps that room locked?-a sort of Bluebeard chamber where she keeps the heads of her victims. Her victims! am I becoming one?" As this thought came to him, Montrose pushed back the hair from his forehead im- patiently, and threw himself into a chair. He   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.       259 indulged in  a fit of musing, that ended in making him    feel very uncomfortable, and he sprang up again and shook himself. "I must get out of this; but for this ta- bleaux  party Mrs. Norris has set her heart upon, I'd go to-morrow; but I must, and will, go somewhere, anywhere, as soon as it is over." "DEAR HFT.,N. " wrote Gertrude; "I have told you of Montrose's return; of our meeting, and his failing to re- cognise me. Dearest! how can I bear the new trial that is to be mine? He loves me! me, as he knows me now- Dolores Clayton-not as Gertrude; poor Gertrude has not heard firom him for five long, weary years! But Dolores Clayton has won his heart! Believe me, dearest, I am in- nocent of any effort to bring this about, strong as the temptation was, and is. "I can see, too, that he struggles against his feelings, and heaven knows I help him all I can, for I am, like an icicle to him, and I never unbend. God only knows how I long to tell him all-to throw my arms around his neck and call him husband! Suppose I were to tell him who I am; suppose I put aside all memory of the last six sad years, forget what I have suffered at his hands, and re- member only my undying love? Would he spurn me, or would the fascinations of Dolores Clayton be strong enough to beautify the face of his lawful wife? Oh, Helen, Helen I pray for me, child, for my cross seems sometimes heavier than I can bear! "Kate Norris has made me promise to give a tableaux party next week. She, too, sees the impression I have   260     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. made on Montrose, and, naturally knowing no reason to prevent, tries her best to throw us as much together as she can. So, you see, my task is rendered doubly difficult. -"4 He has been here a month, and thlough, at first, he talked somewhat of returningr to Europe, he seems now to have given up the idea. If he does not go, Imust. I must put a wide space between us." Such was the state of matters when the 8d of January brought the evening of the tableaux party. Meantime Mr. Macgregor had recovered, and the morning of the 3d Montrose received a few hurried lines from him, telling him of his re- covery, and that as soon as possible he would see Gertrude, and let him know the result ; that he could not give him her address without her special permission. Montrose was reading a novel, leaning bacl in a lounging chair, when the letter was handed to him; he coolly twisted it up, lit a cigar with it and went on with his book.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      261 CHAPTER XXXIII. "When headstrong passion gets the reins of reason, The force of nature, like too strong a gale, For want of ballast, oversets the vessel." S^^ HE evening of the third of January, Ger- trude's rooms were crowded; the small cabinet at the end of the drawing room had been fitted with a raised floor to serve as a stage. The first tableau was Marie Stuart and Chas- tellar; Gertrude and Montrose. This had been Mrs. Norris' fancy, and she insisted so per- sistently that Gertrude was unable to refuse. This tableau was first, to enable her to attend to her guests. Her dress was superb; it was copied strictly from an old engraving that her-father had brought from Scotland, a copy itself of a portrait of the lovely and unfortunate queen at Holyrood House. Over a lemon colored satin dress, high in the throat with long, tight fitting sleeves, she wore a blue velvet one, buttoned with pearls and cut square at the neck. The skirt was open   262    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. over the satin under dress, and was trimmed, as were the long flowing sleeves, with ermine. Round her throat was a double ruff, parted by a collaret of pearls. Pearls gleamed in her ears, and she wore a rope of them thrown loosely over her shoulders. On her head was the traditional "Marie Stuart cap" of blue velvet, bordered with pearls, to which was fastened a long white lace veil. One hand supported her head, while the other held partly open a book that lay in her lap. Montrose as Chastellar, wore the trunk hose of the period, of white velvet; a doublet of blue slashed with white, and a short blue cloak thrown over his shoulder; deep lace at his throat and wrists. His hat of blue velvet, with a long white plume, fastened by a cluster of pearls, lay at his side, while he knelt at her feet on a satin cush- ion; and was supposed to be delighting his mis- tress with the strains evoked from his guitar. Rapturous applause followed this picture, and the folding doors that performed the office of curtain were drawn back three times. When they were closed for the last time, and -for an instant Montrose found himself alone   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    263 with Gertrude, a wild impulse came over him, and seizing her hand he pressed it to his lips, and a few incoherent words escaped him- words that brought him back to a sense of what he had done, as soon as spoken, and fling- ing her hand from him he sprang up, opened the door leading into the hall and rushed up stairs to the room assigned him for the evening as a dressing room. Gertrude sat petrified with conflicting emo- tions crowding on her, and she had not moved when, five minutes having elapsed, Mr. and Mrs. Norris came to take their places for the next tableau., '"Oh, Gertrude! how perfect it was! I am so glad I made you take that character, no one could have done it half so well!" The words roused Gertrude, and she rose from her seat and made some suitable reply to her friend's congratulations. Then with an effort she devoted herself to her duties as hostess, taking no part in the tableau. Montrose, alone in his dressing room, flung himself down upon a lounge, and covering his face with his hands groaned aloud. "Fool! fool!" he muttered, "what have I   264    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. done,-and how can I explain those words away --if I am silent will she not consider them a wanton insult, and justly?--shall I tell her all? - I will! yes, I will take courage and tell her all to-morrow, she is too true and noble a woman not to forgive me!" A knock at the door broke in upon his thoughts, and Robert Norris appeared dressed for the next tableau, and exclaimed at his friend's tardiness. "I will be ready in five minutes, Bob., they can wait that long I guess," and he sprang up and began to tear off the rich dress he had worn as Chastellar. "There, easy, my dear fellow!" cried his friend, " don't spoil all that finery at that rate -I'll get Harry to recite 'Sheridan's ride' to amuse the folks till you are ready." The second tableau had been Mr. and Mrs. Norris as "sixteen and sixty;" he was dressed as an old man, grey-haired and spectacled; was pressing one fair hand of a young girl to his lips, while she holds the other up be- tween him and her partly averted, laughing face, to hide her uncontrolable amusement. Montrose was longer than he thought to be   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.      265 in changing his dress, and Harry Norris ren- dered "Sheridan's Ride" very spirited. A few moments after, the doors again opened for the "Bandit's Death." Montrose, in a suit of black velvet, with a crimson scarf tied round his waist, lay stretched on the ground, his head' supported by his wife, (Mrs. Norris,) who vainly tried to staunch the blood from his wound. His band, in their picturesque dresses, stood around, leaning upon their guns, watching the expiring agonies of their chief; and back of them was a wayside station, or niche in which was a statue of the Blessed Virgin. Several other tableau followed, but Mon- trose took no part in them. lie met Robert Norris in the hall, and begged him to convey his excuses to Miss Clayton, as a violent head- ache obliged him to retire. With this feminine excuse he left the house, and rushed to his room, which he paced like a caged lion half the night, alternately blaming Gertrude fo' her silence, and cursing his own' evil fortune which had led him to make such an egregious fool of himself. Tired out, at length, by the violence of his own feelings, he threw himself, dressed as he was, on the bed, and slept soundly until morning. 22   266    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER XXXIV. "Slowly folding, how she lingered O'er the words his hands had traced." tI9AR away in a post-office in Switzerland, ffi  two weeks previous to the scenes des- cribed in the last chapter, a letter was found, that had slipped down into some out of the way corner, and laid there all this time, when it should have been across the ocean, where it had a task to perforrm, that was an im- portant one, and delaying which had caused weeks of misery, sorrow, and almost sin. But it starts on its way at last, and on the morning of the 5th of January, is laid on Dolores Clayton's table, in the mysterious cabi- net that had excited Mrs. Norris' curiosity so much. e With this foreign letter, was one from Mac- gregor. The original direction on the foreign letter to Philadelphia had been erased, and Gertrude's present one substituted in Mac- gregor's hand-writing.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    267 The little room had been restored to its former condition; many things, particularly all that would have been a revelation to Montrose, having been removed for the previous evening. Gertrude sat at the table writing, when Mar- garet entered and laid the two letters down, she did not look up, nor did she pause until she had finished the page upon which she was engaged. When the company had dispersed the eve- ning before, and Gertrude was once more alone, she had time to think of the words which had escaped Montrose's lips so wildly. Al- though she knew she ought to be angry and to repel him, in spite of l:erself a feeling of hap- piness would well up in her heart, and she strove to make up her mnind to tell him all. She knew he would seek her the next day; that he would come to ask her forgiveness; and how he would extricate himself from his painful position, she was curious to see; and after a long mental struggle, she made up her mind to tell    him who she was.   l Little sleep visited her eyes that night, and she was glad when the day broke, the day that was to put her fate in her own hands, fir weal or woe, as she herself might determine. She   268     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. arose early and attended mass at the Jesuit s church near, and came home calm    and com- forted, and was waiting quietly as she could, for the visit she expected so certainly; writing to to Helen, when the two letters came. She took up Macglegor's and read it with a throbbing heart. Montrose had sought her; he had come home on purpose to see her, and all this precious time had been lost! Perhaps he cared no longer for a reconciliation!  Such were her    thoughts when she read Macgregor's letter, and then she picked up the other one. One glance at the foreign post-mark, at the hand-writing, and she tore it eagerly open. This was it: "Gertrude, I am coming home. Back to home and duty so long neglected. Will my wife pardon the past? You are surprised at this change no doubt, but it is not as sud- den as you suppose. Did you imagine that my conscience was dead; that my heart was all stone? that they never spoke, or I never listened? In all these years they have not been silent, Gerty, though I have striven against their promptings, which I will do no longer. Let me tell my story, wife, and then you may judge me, and I will abide by your decision: I loved your sister, from the first moment that I saw her,   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.       269 attracted by her surpassing beauty, charmed by her child. like freshness of manner, her cheerful, bright disposition. The strange arrangement made by that old -ancestor of ours, came upon me like an avalanche; too soon after the blow I had received from your sister's refusal of my love, and for a time, I was very angry with what I called my untoward fate. Your father sounded me as to my intentions, the very day I overheard my mother's words to you, on that event- ful evening. I found they both expected, wished our mar- riage-in fact, that your father's commercial honor de- pended upon it. During all this time, I had made my- self believe that you loved some one else; an idea gathered fri-om your emotion on the day the letters were read. But on that evening, which doubtless you remember well, I determined to do my part, leaving it to yourself to decide upon your own. I need not tell you the unkind construction I put upon your unexpected acceptance of my proposal so insulting in its coldness, and cruel in its words. -This idea of mine, that you cared for some one else, was confirmed afterwards by some detached words I found up- on a sheet of blotting paper in the library just after you had written a letter. Then when I awoke from that fever in Washington, and found only strange faces around me-heard nothing from you in reply to a letter written after my recovery, I grew angry again at the neglect of a duty, for the performance of which, I knew I had no claim upon you, and deter- mined never to trouble you again. I have spent my time, after the first few months devoted to the recovery of my health, in England among some dis- tant relatives of my mother, on the Montrose side of the   270     THE MONTARGES LEGACY. house; later, we have been traveling through Germany and Switzerland; and ever at my heart, battling with my angry pride, was the longing for home loves and home comforts, that only an American really knows how to enjoy. One by one, little acts of yours, words, looks, came back upon me, and I began to think, maybe in my blindness I had cast away that pearl witlout price, a true woman's love. Thus I was in a measure prepared for the revela- tion I had through a stranger, only yesterday. Gertrude, can you, will you forgive me? A few chance words from a stranger, an officer, who had been in the hospital at Washington and saw your care and devotion; tore the veil from my eyes, that my own mean selfishness had drawn there. You perceive, I give myself no qtiarter; I see my conduct in its true lidght. O my wife! I throw myself up- on your noble heart and generous disposition; I will not make long protestations of affection, I can only hope to prove my repentance and make some slight atonement for the past by devotion, such as wife never had from- hus- band, and a love so sincere you need not fear to accept it. Still I cannot blame you if you refuse the boon I crave. I know I have been base, and deserve nothing but ,corn and contempt at your hands. But I hope for something better. Now, Gertrude, having made my confession, I must wait, until I reach my native land again, to hear your verdict. I follow this too soon to receive an answer this side the water. Will a letter, containing your forgiveness, meet me on my landing; or will a silence, more eloquent than all the scorn your lips could speak, send me out once more a wan- derer?"   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    271 Gertrude read the letter through slowly, losing not a word; then, with her eyes still fixed upon the writing, let the hand that held it sink into her lap. "At last!" she murmured," at last! He says he loves me, and yet he looked into my eyes last night, and did not know me! O! my love, my husband! at length you are all mine! What must he not have suffered! nearly two months, but the end has come." Then she seized her pen, and wrote hastily upon a scrap of paper, the first that lay near her: "These have just reached me; come to me." And crushing both letters and the paper into an envelope, directed it to Colonel Beresford, and rang the bell. Margaret answered it, and was startled at the change a few moments had produced in her mistress, before so quiet and subdued, now her eyes sparkling, and her cheeks glowing. But Gertrude gave her no time to make any remark, telling her to give the envelope to the coachman, to take to Mrs. Norris' house; to ask for Colonel Beresford, and to give it into his own hands; to tell him Miss Clayton sent it, and wished to-see him. t"Go quickly, Margaret; yes, it is all right at   272    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. last; my troubles are over I believe: that is if that package and my message reach my-Oolo- nel Beresford as I send them; go quickly, and I will tell you what I can after a while." Margaret obeyed her, but her eyes were full of happy tears, and her heart was beating, keeping time to her mistress'.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     273 CHAPTER XYXXV. "The past is all atoned for; never more Shall its dark shadow rest upon our hearts 1  ByOR was Gertrude mistaken in her expecta- tions. When Montrose awoke that morn- ing, his first feeling was a relief that his mind was made up to a certain course, and that there was to be no more anxiety and uncer- tainty. Then, after he had had this explana- tion with Miss Clayton, he would sail again for Europe or, perhaps, for South America, which would have the charm of novelty at any rate. Then, if he should lose his life in any of the jungles or tiger-haunted forests of the country, perhaps, when it was too late, Gertrude would regret her cruelty, and hold his memory in some degree of fondness. Such were some of his thoughts while he was dressing, but he felt too nervous to care much for his breakfast, and looked badly enough to substantiate his excuse of the pre- vious night. As the morning progressed, he   274    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. grew still more nervous as the visiting-hour approached, and at the earliest possible mo- ment, started for the dreaded ordeal. Margaret had hardly reached the head of the stairs, on her way to fulfil her message to the coachman, when the door-bell rung sharply. It was almost too early for visitors; so Margaret answered the bell, though it was not her busi- ness. Montrose was on the step. "Can I see Miss Clayton?" he asked, hur- riedly, hardly looking at Margaret, who had hitherto kept out of his sight awhen he came, fearing he would recognize her. She feared now to attract his attention, and answered quickly that Miss Clayton was at home. "And she was just sending this to you, sir, with a request that you would call: she wished to see you." Margaret handed him the letter without looking at him.  She need not have been afraid: Montrose was too utterly miserable to observe anything, and too full of his ow1n thoughts to tale in the full sense of her words, he only seemed to hear the last part of the sentence: for he glanced at the letter, and then saying "Tell her I am here," sprang up the stairs to the drawing-room.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    275 Margaret sought her mistress, and told her what she had done. "He did not open the envelope?" "'No, ma'am; not before he went into the a rlor." "Very well! I will go to him." She turned very pale,and clasped both hands over her heart for a moment. Margaret took a step towards her, but she shook her head, saying, with a faint smile: "Iit will all be over in a few moments--pray for me, Margaret." Then she put her hand on the knob of the door and pushing it back, entered the drawing room. Montrose was standing at the window, and so eagerly reading Macegregor's letter, which trembled in his nervous fingers, that he did not hear Gertrude approach-she stepped very softly over the velvet carpet. Gliding to with- in a few feet of him she stood still and uttered but one word: ",Montrose." He raised his eyes from the paper: for a full minute they stood and looked into each others faces; the hand that held the letter dropped at his side, the letter from his fingers. Another second and he knelt at her feet.   276    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. "Gertrude, my wife, forgive me!" "I did-I do--I did long ago-oh, Montrose, my own dear husband!" "You forgive the words I spoke last night?"' he asked, looking up at her. For answer she stooped and kissed his fore- head. Then he sprang up and held out his arms. She crept into them and laid her head on his shoulder, murmuring: "I have prayed for, longed for this hour. I have been so lonesome all these years, Montrose, so weary, oh my husband, but I have found rest at last!" He folded his arms around her and their lips met in one long passionate kiss. Long hours they sat together in that little room, undisturbed, for Margaret denied her mistress to every one. But they hardly knew how the time passed, there was so much to tell, so much to hear. "Did you really fail to recognize me alto- gether? Did no suspicion cross your mind?" "No; the likeness troubled me greatly as did your voice, but I so little dreamed of finding you here, under such circumstances, and Mac-   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    277. gregor's letter rather intimated that you were still in Philadelphia,-besides'-" he paused ab- ruptly. "Besides you never dreamed that the poor plain Gertrude you had left, would have bloomed into the fascinating Miss Clayton," interrupted Gertrude, laughing. "No, I certainly did not, and Miss Clayton's fascinations proved almost too much for me in my disappointment and chagrin. I had made up my mind to leave the country next week, for- ever." "And I, too, felt that I must put a wide space between us, and if you had not gone I should!" replied G4ertrude. "Now, how are we to appear in our proper characters as man and wife, married seven years ago?" he asked. "I don't know-suppose we run away!" sug- gested Gertrude, laughing. But they did not run away. By looking at their watches they found it was nearly six o'clock so long a time had passed in their mutual explanations, and yet it had seemed so short. "I must go to aunt Clayton for a few 23   278   THE MONTARGES LEGACY. moments now-it was too selfish ofn me to neglect her so long, but she will forgive me when I tell her of my new happiness," said Gertrude, when she found how late it was. "Then I will send a note by Margaret--you remember Margaret?-she is with me still--to Kate Norris and ask her to come and spend the evening with me, when you can introduce your wife to her. Meanwhile," she added, with a courtesy that would have done honor to the court of Marie Antoinette, " will Colonel Beres- ford dine with Miss Clayton?" "I accept your invitation with pleasure, Miss Clayton," he replied with a bow as low. They were seated side by side when Kate Norris and her husband came. She entered the parlor with a merry jest upon her lips, but stood arrested ere she had advanced two steps. For Montrose, taking Gertrude's hand, led her up to them saying: "Allow me, Mrs. Norris, to -present to you my wife-Mrs. Beresford." "Your wife! -when-where-what do you mean?" "Precisely what I say." But why were you married secretly? it was   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    279 not kind or fair, and-and-there was no necessity for concealment." "We were not married secretly, but with all due solemnity, and before witnesses by the Bis- hop of Philadelphia, eight years ago next May." u Harry, are they crazy-what's the matter?" said the poor little women, turning helplessly to her husband. "No, dear Kate, not crazy," replied Gertrude, putting her arm around her friend's waist, "only very, very happy ; Montrose can tell your husband his story, come with me and I will tell you mine," and she led her into the little cabinet. "'I confess, I am completely puzzled," said Harry Norris, as he turned with Montrose towards the other end of the room. The wonder and surprise was very great when the story got wind. Mr. Macgregor came over to confirm the news and congratulate his old friends on their late found lappiness. Montrose had, in spite of his care, met/one or two old Philadelphia friends, but he had made them promise not to speak of having seen him until he allowed them  to do so. Now  all necessity for secrecy was done away with.   280    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER XXX VI. "Her spirit hath flown from this world of unrest, To repose in the bosom of God." STEP forth from your retirement, oh my queenly Helen! pardon my neglect; it was unavoidable. tHelen's life during the years of Gertrude's sorrow and trouble, had only been clouded by sympathy with her sister. Never for one moment did she regret her choice, or fail to thank God that he had given her grace to choose the "better part." Under the '" cornette" of the sister of charity, her sweet ,face looks as calmly beautiful as under the tule or velvet of former days; her step as light and   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    281 her hand ever ready to relieve the afflicted, her words to comfort the sorrowful, and many a suffering soul has blessed her gentle minister- ing. The sisters had one more meeting after Ger- trude's reconciliation with her husband, and they were once again together under the linden trees of their valley home. Many changes had taken place, and few of their old schoolmates were found; among the sis- ters, too, death and change had been busy, but more than all, Gertrude missed the gentle being whom she had loved with all her warm heart's youthful fervor during her school-days. Noth- ing was-left of her on earth but the mound in the graveyard to the right of Mother Seton's tomb--nothing save the undying memory of her perfect character in the ninds of those who had the happiness of knowing her. Filling for a few years the office of "' Mother," as the Visita- trix of the order is called, she proved herself truly a " mother" in deed as well as name. Un- obtrusive in her manners and in her piety, gen- tle, amiable and affectionate, no one could be in her presence long without feeling drawn out of themselves, and rendered strong to endure or   282    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. suffer, by communion with her angelic nature; while the joyous and gay, in the contemplation of her serene happiness, the reflection of a soul more allied to heaven than earth, found a ready sympathy with and response to their own feel- ings. Truly might Halleck's touching lines be quoted when her name was mentioned, and Ger- trude murmured them almost unconsciously as she stood beside the sister's last earthly resting place: "Green be the turf above thee, Friend of my early days; None knew thee but to love thee, None named thee but to praise." After many lingering walkr through the fa- miliar scenes, recalling with sad pleasure the long ago, Gertrude and Helen parted once more -the former to cross the ocean with her hus- band, the other to a new mission in the far west, carrying with her a sum of money, a thank of- fering from Gertrude that rendered the house to which she went, at once free from the debt, nec- essarily contracted at first, and build a beautiful little church, an edifice much needed by the scattered and indigent congregation. The long parted husband and wife sailed for   THE MONTARGEO LEGACY.    283 Europe in June, and the Xorrises followed them in August.       i Gertrude's reception in England was a warm one; her romantic story, (for Chester and Mon- trose had corresponded, and the latter had au- thorized his friend to explain matters to those who were interested,) rendered her quite a lion- ne, and no drawing-room, route, or dinner party was complete without the elegant Americans. Montrose had told Gertrude Annette's story, and she was much interested in the young girl, whom, as the only child and heiress of Viscount Penryhn, of Penryhn, was the toast of London. She was to be married to the Earl of Chester in August, and after the wedding, to which she insisted her foster parents must come, a con- tinental tour was proposed which Montrose and Gertrude promised to join. Once more Montrose stands upon the plateau in front of the chalet on Monte Rosa, and shows the shuddering Gertrude the ledge of rock, along which he and Chester had made their perilous adventure. Pere Andres met them there and expressed great pleasure at seeing them again,-particularly his dear child Annette.   284    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. Montrose had brought Gertrude first to Monte Rosa, eager to show her a spot so full of in- terest to them both. Thence, they had planned many a pleasant excursion, and one, was to retrace their steps to "clear placid Leman," another to Mont Blanc and Chamounix. From Interlachen they went to Lanterbrunen From the windows of their hotel they could see the wonderful fall of the Stubbach; or as it is translated, "stream of dust." Although poets had sung and travelers de- scribed this wonder, our friends had little idre" of the reality until they stood before it. The side of the mountain down which the water falls is all of bare rock, from eight to nine hundred feet in height; and it is so level, though rough, that the water falls in a direct line till it nearly reaches the ground. 'While the rest of the party were admiring and discussing the falls, Gertrude, attracted by the gorgeous rhododendrons and other moun- tain flowers, wandered up a cleft in the moun- tain, down which a small stream was leaping merrily. Montrose followed her, and the two soon found themselves shut off by the winding path from the rest of the party.   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.    285 "See, Montrose, how deceitful that little stream was, I thought it would prove a mere rivulet, and see how wildly it rushes along down there before it divides into two courses; the one I have followed, as gently playful as a kitten, the other, as roysterous as-as-what shall I compare it to?" she asked, looking up into his face. "Oh anything that is loud and noisy," said Montrose, but is not this grand, superb!" "It is indeed!" The path  Gertrude had  followed had climbed considerably higher than the bed of the little stream, which had proved only the waste water or off-shoot from a regular moun- tain torrent which rushed in a different direc- tion, both having their source from-a stream coming down a narrow defile. "Let me hold you while you look over the edge and see the water below"-said Montrose, putting his arm around Gertrude. See how far above the water course we are, that is quite a tall sapling growing there just beyond us and see the top branches don't come near the height of the path."             ; "It makes me giddy-don't Montrose!" and   286    THE MONTARGES LEGACY, Gertrude turned shuddering away. They walked a few steps further on, and stopped again where the ravine or gorge narrowed con- siderably, and a tree had fallen, forming a nar- row bridge across, for its branches rested on the other side. The stump still remained with its splinters just as the tree had fallen, and not a foot away from it was a twin tree still upright. upright. Montrose had carried his plaid with him ovem his arm, and he now spread it on the ground for a seat for Gertrude. "Rest awhile, Gerty, and then we must hurry back or the rest will be rneasy." They chatted quietly for a Little while, and then Montrose got up and said, going to the edge and resting his foot on the fallen tree: "I wonder if the peasants ever use this tree as a bridge-suppose your life depended on your crossing it, Mrs. Beresford, what would you do?" "Thank heaven there is no such frightful necessity awaiting me, it would be but a choice of deaths!'! The words had hardly passed her lips before   THE MONTARVGES LEGACY.    287 thei- was a crash like thunder, the fallen tree had sank from under Montrose's foot, and be- fore he could catch at the other he had lost his balance and disappeared over the edge of the ravine. ' {   y/    u   288    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. CHAPTER XXXV 11. "]XiY God!"For an instant Gertrude felt YlU as though she were dying; earth and sky disappeared from before her and chaos seemed come again. But only for an in- stant, then, with a strange fascination, she crept to the edge and looked down. The sight of Montrose clinging to the tree he had pointed out to her, only a few minutes before, brought her to herself, and she felt she must call all her presence of mind to her assistance. "Montrose!" Her voice sounded clear above the roar of the waters.  He looked up, and she saw his lips move; but, at first, her intense anxiety to hear,   THE MONTARGES LEGACY.     289 prevented her; at  length she understands. His plaid! Fastening it like a rope, she lets it down over the ravine--but it is too short! A remedy suggests itself; with all her strength she tears at the strong fabric in vain efforts to part it in two, then she remembers the knife she had used in cutting her flowers, and picked it up. Making a sign of encouragement to 5Montrose, she tugged and tore at the plaid till cat last she had divided it lengthwise. She fas- tened the two ends together, but her hands trembled so, she feared- the knot she had made was hardly strong enough, it might break with its precious weight. Then she tied one end around the tree and threw the other one to him. It was now sufficiently long. Montrose had. supported himself against, or rather between, the forked branches of the tree in order not to fatigue his arms, and he caught the shawl as it fell and wound it firmly round his body.  Then he made a sign to her that he was ready. At first Gertrude tried to draw in the plaid by her own unassisted effort, but, though Mon- trose helped her all he could by catching at the shrubs and bushes, and resting his foot in every 24   290    THE MONTTARGES LEGACY.' crevice, she could not do it. But a remedy suggests itself; she winds the shawl round and round the stump of the fallen tree. Steadily she works, until Montrose is able to clasp the trunk of the still upright tree, and by its assistance, raises himself to the path again. "Safe! thank, thank God!" and Gertrude falls fainting to the ground. Montrose knelt over 1-er, and by his kisses and tender words, brought her to herself. "My precious wife! What would have be- came of me but for your presence of mind!" "Oh, let us go down-go away from   this terrible spot!" she cried with a shudder, making an effort to rise, but her trembling limbs refused. to sustain her and she sank back again. Mon- trose drew her towards him, and held her in his arms until she grew more calm. At last she said, starting up; C"But you are hurt, Montrose, and here I have been thinking of my own feelings only--you must be hurt after such a fall!" "Not even scratched, Dame Durden," he re- plied gaily. "I feel a little fatigued, that is all, and if you are able, we will rejoin the others." At this moment, Annette and the Earl made   THE MONTARGES LEGACY,     291 their appearance, and were told of Montrose's escape. Together they returned to the inn; but Chester noticed that Montrose looked pale, in spite of his assurance that there was nothing the matter, and made Gertrude lean on his own arm, while Annette followed with Beresford. At the inn, Montrose was glad of a glass of brandy and to lie down; he did feel "rather used up" he acknowledged, and was several days before he was himself again. To her dying day, Gertrude will keep that shawl and knife among the dearest of her treas- ures. Having sorrowed with Gertrude in her sorrow, we would fain rejoice with her in her joy, al- though by it we run the risk of tiring others. Patience, reader, one more scene and then fare- well. They are at Rome, Gertrude and Montrose, and to them the storied city was full of deep, undying interest.          f It is Holy NVeek; the winter months had been passed in Naples and Sicily; and now they are at Rome for the Easter ceremonies. Letters, to the kind and courteous President and Director of the American College at Rome,   292    THE MONTARGES LEGACY. had placed our friends in the very best position for seeing and hearing all that was to be seen and heard. Consequently they lost nothing that was of interest. They are alone in their apartments after the solemn service of the "Tenebrse " on Holy Thurs- day, and have been talking over what they had witnessed. Presently Gertrude lays her hand on her husband's and says: "I never thought to be as happy as I am, Montrose, but there is one thing wanting to make that happiness complete." "Only one thing, Gertrude? speak and if it is possible for me to perfect your happiness, rest assured dearest I will spare no effort." "You can do it, Montrose, and you only." "How, my wife?" "By joining me in my glorious faith,-oh! my husband, is not your heart moved by what you have seen?" He looked into her excited face in silence, then slowly shook his head: "If faith is a gift of God, Gerty, he has de- nied it to me, as yet, perhaps your prayers may prevail in the end. Yes, I have been moved by   THE MONTARGES LEGACY. /    293 what I have seen to put aside all my old per- judices, and acknowledge that they were igno- rant ones; you will never meet with opposition from me in the practice of your religion, Gerty, more I cannot promise you. What! tears! Nay, dearest, do not let it trouble you so, I give you full permission to convert me if you can, and he stooped over her and kissed the tears from her eyes. There let us leave them, resting under St. Peter's wondrous dome in the midst of relics of bygone faith and piety, happy in themselves and in the power their large fortune gave them to relieve the wants of others. And if the gift of faith had, as Montrose said, been denied him, let us pray with Gertrude that it may not be so always; but, that he with others who are waiting for the boon may not be long without its heavenly solace. I have tried to show the influence of our holy religion in supporting the human heart under life's heaviest burdens; and how that religion could lead one calculated to shine a brilliant light in the world of gaiety and fashion to for- sake all, not from a false sentimental idea of a devotee not driven to the cloister by a broken   294   TVE MONTA RGES LEGACY. heart or "blasted hopes"--but actuated by the pure love of God to leave all things and follow Him. as the lowliest of his handmaids. If I have failed, the fault rests with me, not with the ideas I would fain illustrate. And so! Vale!  ')   CATHOLIC BOOKS RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY PETER F.
