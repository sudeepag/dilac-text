MY DEAR JUDGE: More than twenty years ago I wrote this story at your suggestion.  It is now re-published as specially applicable to the times we live in. Permit me to dedicate it to you in remembrance of our long and unbroken friendship. Yours most sincerely, GOEO. H. MLES. BALTIMORE, March 17, 1871.  Entered, according to Act of Congress, in the year 1871, by JOHN MURPHY & CO., in the Office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington.    PREFACE. THE romance of this story is founded upon the Truce of God, which in the earlier ages of feudalism sanc- tified to peace a portion of every week. The historical narrative is taken from Voigt's Life of Gregory VII., and gives a full account of the memorable contest be- tween that august Pontiff and Henry IV. of Germany: embracing a period of his- tory always of the highest interest and importance, but which at this moment is supremely significant, inasmuch as it is the great prototype of the persecution which now assails His Holiness, Pius the Ninth. -\sii   f F   THE TRUCE OF GOD. CHAPTER I. Of ancient deeds so long forgot; Of feuds whose memory was not; Of forests now laid waste and bare; Of towers which harbor now the hare; Of manners long since changed and gone; Of chiefs who under their gray stone So long had slept, that fickle fame Hath blotted from her rolls their name.

Gothic temples of the living God were new. It was the eleventh century: the sun shone as brightly then as now; ay, and virtue too, though sympathy for a lustful tyrant has stamped the age with infamy. Through an extensive forest in Suabia, as the old chronicle from which I copy re- lates, a gallant youth was urging on, with voice and rein, a steed that seemed bold and fiery as his rider. The youth's flash- ing eye, and the spear in his hand, told clearly enough that the boar was before him. On he went, as if the forest were his element, now bending low beneath the knotted bough, now swerving aside from the stern old trunk which sturdily opposed his progress, and seemed to mock him as he passed. On he went, as if danger were behind and safety before him; as if lhe galloped to save his own life, not to risk it in taking a boar's. An angry bark and a fearful howl rang in the distance, and   THE RKUCE OF GOD.    " the hunter's bugle sounded a merry blast. On he went, faster than before, and now as if he sought his mortal foe. The boar was at bay; monarch of the wood, he had turned to defend his realm, and his white tusks were soon red with the blood of the noble hounds who fearlessly disputed his right. The youth leaped from his horse with the speed of thought. Bred to the chase, the well-trained animal stood firm while his master cautiously, but with the calmness of the victor of a hundred frays, advanced against the bristling monster. Quitting the dogs for this new assailant, the boar came madly on; the huntsman sank upon one knee, and so true was his eye, and so firm his hand, that the heart of the savage was cloven by the spear. The youth rose to his feet, dizzy from the shock, and, springing nimbly upon the grim body of his prostrate victim, his fine form swelling with the rapture of his re- cent triumph, brought his horn to his lips, shs ont      ' is   12   THE TRUCE OF GOD. and again its notes went ringing merrily through the woods. Echoes, like fading memories, growing fainter and fainter as they receded, gave the only response. W' Where cal they be?" said the youth; "their steeds were fleet. Out of sight and out of hearing! How completely I have beaten them." He laughed triumphantly as he said this, and, sitting down upon the long grass, be- gan to caress an enormous hound that panted at his feet, as uncQncernedly as though the forest now contained nothing more formidable than doves or lambs. His horse, thoroughly domesticated, strayed a little from the dead boar, feeding as it went. The youth took off his plumed bonnet, and, flinging back his long black hair, fell into one of those light, smiling day-dreams which belong only to the young and inno- cent. He built fifteen air-castles in as many   / THE TRUCE OF GOD.     13 minutes. But at last he grew impatient; he sounded blast after blast; still no an- swer came. The trees kept up their sleepy sigh, and the sapless branches creaked, but no human voice, no human foot save his own, broke the silence. "Thou hast given me a goodly chase," exclaimed the youth, springing up and addressing the boar, "and I shall wear: this in remembrance of thee." He drew his hunting-knife, and soon uprooted one of the monster's tusks. De- positing the precious relic in a little pouch he wore at his side, he mounted his horse, rather puzzled where to go. "It is easier to get in this oaken field than to get out of it," said our hunter; "but if the forest have an end, I 'll find it. Now, my dear loitering friends, we hunt each other." Giving his horse the spur, and allowing the creature to choose its course, he called on the lagging hounds, and dashed away 2 ,  f    "   THE TRUCE OF GOD. as rapidly as he had come. The wood was light as ever, and here and there a sun- beam lay, like a golden spear, along the ground; yet the rich lustre of the sly, wherever it was visible, the hum of num- berless insects, the fresh flight of the awak- ened bird, and the freer and cooler breeze, warned the youth that sunset was near. On went the noble steed, with steady step and trembling nostril, while his finely veined ears spoke so rapidly that the rider could scarcely understand their language. They passed through long lines of trees that opened into other lines, from one limited horizon to another, yet all was green before and behind, to the right and to the left, one interminable emerald. The light turned from a rich gold to a golden red, and yet it played only on whispering leaves and on the long grass at their feet. Still the youth felt no fear, but hummed some old ballad, or drew a lively peal from his horn. Hie dismounted to refresh him-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     15 self at a spring that had nestled among some rocks, and was murmuring there like a spoiled child. Having cared for the gallant animal which had borne him so well, he stretched himself a moment upon the green bank. "Ha! what is that!" he exclaimed, bending forward to listen; " a horseman? Let him come; friend or foe, I shall be glad to see him." I  He was on his horse in a moment. As he turned to look behind, he saw a gentle- man, richly dressed, and admirably mount- ed, coming at full speed from another quar- ter of the wood. The stranger was quite young, perhaps a year or two older than our hunter, but certainly not over twenty- three. The youth knit his brows as the horseman approached, and eyed him keen- ly and sternly. When within a few yards of the spring, the stranger dismounted and drew his sword. The youth did the same. His handsome features were now distorted X   16   THE TRUCE OF GOD. with anger and disdain, and it was diffi- cult to recognize in the fierce figure, that seemed the guardian dragon of the foun- tain, the laughing boy who sat there so quietly a moment before. The stranger appeared to return the bitter hatred. "I have found you, Gilbert de Hers," lie muttered; " your bugle has rung your knell." Gilbert replied but by a laugh of scorn, and the next instant their swords gleamed in the air. But just as the two blades met with a sharp clang, there came stealing through the wood the mellow sound of a distant bell. It was like the voice of an angel forbidding strife! Those soft, lin- gering notes seemed to have won a sweet- ness from the skies to pour out upon the world, and, filling the space between field and cloud, connected for a moment heaven and earth - for they wake in the heart of man the same emotions more perfectly felt in paradise.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     17 For many centuries after the destruction of the Roman Empire, when all human institutions were swept away by the resist- less torrent that poured from the north, and the Church of God alone stood safe and firm, with the rainbow of heaven around her, the stern warriors of Germany asserted their rights, or redressed their wrongs with the sword, and scorned to bow before the impotent decrees of a civil tribunal. A regular system of private warfare gradually sprang up, which falsely led every man of honor to revenge any real or fancied offence offered to any of his kindred. The most deadly enmity frequently existed between neighboring chiefs, and the bitter feeling was transmit- ted unimpaired from father to son. The most dreadful consequences inevitably re- sulted from this fatal installation of might in the outraged temple of justice. Until lately a blind prejudice and a perverted history have charged this unfortunate state 2*      B   18   THE TRUCE OF GOD. of things to the pernicious influence of the Church of Rome. But the wiser Protest- ants of the present day, considering it rather a poor compliment to their faith to assign its birth to the sixteenth century, are beginning to be awake to the powerful instrumentality of the Christian Church in, the regeneration of manlkind, and the pro- duction of modern civilization. Few, in- deed, even with the sight of history, can form an adequate idea of the immensity of the task assigned to Christianity in shedding light over the chaos that followed the overthrow of Rome, in reducing it to order, and preparing the nicely fitted ele- ments of modern Europe. The Catholic Church beheld, and bit- terly deplored the evils of private warfare. Council after council fulminated its decrees against the pernicious system; men were exhorted by the sacred relics of the saints to extinguish their animosities, and abstain from violence. But the custom had taken *   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     19 deep root; for, in the laiguage of a favor- ite Protestant historian, "it flattered the pride of the nobles, and gratified their favorite passions." It is easy to reform where the passions are pampered, and the vicious heart of humanity pants wildly for the reformation; but in the eleventh cen- tury the Church had gained a partial vic- tory over the dearest appetites of the fiery Frank and the warlike Saxon. It was enacted, under pain of excommunication, that private warfare should cease from the sunset of Wednesday to the morning of Monday, and few were hardy enough to expose themselves to the penalty. The respite from hostilities which followed was called the "TRUCE OF GOD." I It was not the musical voice of the bell that made Gilbert de Hers pause on the very threshold of the struggle, and bite his lip until it grew white; thut the sweet- toned bell announced the sunset of Wed- nesday. The young men stood gazing at  .   20   THE TRUCE OF GOD. each other, as though some spell had trans-. formed them into stone. But the messen- ger of peace had stayed the uplifted sword, and, sheathing their unstained weapons, they knelt upon the green carpet beneath them, and put forth the same prayer to the same God. It is a sight that may well command the eyes of angels, when, though deaf to earthly laws and considerations, the angry heart, in the first heat of its wild career, still stops obedient to the voice of religion. Amid the dross of human frailty, the pure metal shines with the lustre that surrounds the sinner in the morning of his conversion. They rose almost together, and their faces, so lately flushed with anger, were now calm and subdued. "Farewell! Henry de Stramen," said Gilbert, as he leaped into the saddle. "Farewell!!" replied his antagonist, and, almost side by side, they proceeded in the direction of the bell.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     21 A deadly feud was raging between the families of Hers and Stramen. It had con- tinued for more than twenty years, and now burned with unabated fury. It orig- inated in some dispute between Gilbert's father and the Lord Robert de Stramen, Henry's uncle, which resulted in the death of the latter. The Baron of Hers was chargedwith the murder, and, though he persisted in declaring his innocence, Hen- ry's impetuous father, the Lord Sandrit de Stramen, swore over the dead body of his brother to take a bitter revenge on the Baron of Hers and all his line. Henry de Stramen had been nursed in the bitterest hostility to all who bore the name of Hers, and the unrelenting persecution of the Lord Sandrit had Ode Gilbert detest most cordially the ho se of Stramen. It was with mutual hatred, then, that the two young men had met at the spring. They knew each other well, for they had often fought hand to hand, with their kinsmen   22   THE TRUCE OF GOD. and serfs around them. Now they were alone, and what a triumph would be the victor's! but the bell, the bell of peace, the silver-tongued herald of the truce of God, had sheathed their weapons. It could not have been without a severe struggle that the two mortal foes rode qui- etly in the same direction, with but a few yards between them. They were not half an hour in the saddle when they discovered the spire of the church they were both in search of, rising gracefully above the trees. As they emerged from the forest, they could see stretching before them a broad expanse of hill and dale, wood and field. Scattered here and there were the humble dwellings of the forester and husbandman, and, from their midst, towering above them, like Jupiter among the demigods, stately and stern rose the old castle of the house of Stramen. The western sky was still bathed in light, and shared its glories with the earth; airy clouds, ever changing   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     23 their hues, sported, like chameleons, on the horizon; the stream that wound around the castle seemed sheeted with polished silver; the herds and flocks were all still, and the voice of the birds was the only sound; and, amid this beauty and repose, how lovely and majestic was that finely moulded Gothic church! Henry de Stramen tied his horse to a tree, and was soon lost in the elegantly carved doorway. Gilbert paused a mo- ment, and gazed upon the open country before him with very mingled emotions. he had been there before at the head of his clan to disturb the serenity which, in spite of himself, was now softening his heart. He did not linger long, but led his horse a little within the woods, and entered the church. The gray-headed priest at the altar was solemnly chanting, from the beautiful liturgy of the Church, as he knelt down on the hard aisle, and the branching ceiling seemed to catch and re- [   24    THE TRUCE OF GOD. peat the notes. Through the stained win- dow, where was pictured in unfading col- ors many a scene suggesting the goodness and mercy of God, and the blessed tidings of salvation, came the fading light of day, softened and beautified. It was not merely the superior genius of the age that made the chlapels and cathedrals of the ages of faith so immensely superior to the crea- tions of the present day, but its piety too; that generous and pure devotion which in- duced our ancestors to employ their best faculties and richest treasures in preparing an abode as worthy as earth could make it of the presence of the Son of God. Then the house of the minister was not more splendid than his church, his side- board not more valuable than the altar. Gilbert saw around him the hard, sun- burnt features, the stalwart forms he 'had marked in the desperate fray; he could touch the hands, now clasped in prayer, that had been so often raised against him   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     25 in anger. Beside him knelt the maiden, with her brow all smnooqth and unfurrowed by care, and the matron who, numbering more than double her years, had felt more than treble her sorrows. The youth was deeply moved, as he gazed, and thought he might have robbed that mother of her son, that wife of her husband, that sister of a brother. Those gentle, melancholy beings had never harmed him, and, per- haps, in a moment of passion, he had de- prived their existence of half its sweet- ness, and turned their smiles to tears. It was with an aching, an humbled heart that he bowed his head until it touched the cold floor, when the Lamb without spot was elevated for the adoration of the faithful. A hymn, befitting the occasion, had been intoned, and the priest had left the altar, but those fervent men and women did not hurry from the church as if grateful for permission to retire, but lingered to med- itate and pray. 3   26   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Gilbert remained until all had gone save Henry de Stramen and a lady who knelt beside him. They rose at length, and, passing so close to Gilbert that he could distinctly see their faces, left him alone. He was in, the act of rising when the priest appeared, and beckoned him into the sacristy. "Remain here," the old man said, tak- ing the youth by the hand. "I must hurry home, father," replied Gilbert; " my father will have no peace, thinking the boar has killed-me." "Let him fret awhile; it is better he should lament you alive, than dead by the serfs of Stramen." "They dare not attack me!" exclaimed the youth; "they fear the Church and my own arm too much for that!" "Nay, peace!" rejoined the priest; " it is better not to expose them to the tempta- tion, or you to the danger." The practicability of spending the night   THE' TRUCE OF GOD.     27 in, security in the very teeth of Stramen Castle had not occurred to Gilbert; he hesitated a second or two, and then, as if all his plans and ideas had undergone a thorough revolution, gracefully promised obedience. "You are right, father," he said; , and to speak truth, I am weary enough. If you promise me protection to-night, I will gladly rest my head wherever you place the pillow." "Those who sleep with me," whispered his venerable  adviser,  "must content themselves without a pillow.  But I will promise you a safe couch, though it is a hard one; the softest beds are not always the freest from danger. In the mean time tarry here until I have said some prayers." "But my horse," interposed Gilbert. His companion rang a   small bell. A benevolent-looking man, somewhat past the prime   of life, plainly dressed in a black cassock, answered the call. The   28   THE TRUCE OF GOD. priest conversed awhile with him, in an undertone, and then, ascertaining from Gilbert where his horse was, dismissed the attendant, remarking that the animal should not suffer. Motioning Gilbert to a chair, the priest entered the sanctuary. Instead of sitting down, the young noble leaned against a lancet window which commanded a view of the neighboring castle. He stood there looking idly upon the darkening prospect, until the appearance of two persons riding rapidly along the main road to the castle, aroused his attention. He followed them eagerly with his eyes until they were com- pletely lost in the twilight. One of the riders was evidently a female; but it would be inquiring too minutely into Gilbert's thoughts to determine whether that cir- cumstance, or the proneness of youth to become interested in trifles, excited his curiosity. Night was fast approaching, and a light   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     29 from the altar made itself felt throughout the church. Still the priest knelt before the sacred tabernacle, and Gilbert longed for his appearance. He grew impatient of being alone, when a companion was so near at hand; the place was strange, and there were no well-known objects to stand in the place of friends, supplying by the thousand associations they conjure up, and their mute appeals to memory, the absence of language. The minutes wore heavily on; but at length the priest entered the sacristy. Gilbert followed him out of the church to a very small house a few paces off, within the shadow of the wood. The house, which was but one story high, was divided into two rooms by a stone partition. In the back room slept :the pastor of the church, Father Omehr. The front room contained a table and a bench. Father Omehr, for this was the name of Gilbert's companion, struck a light and made the 3*   30   THE TRUCE OF GOD. young man sit down upon the bench, while he spread out upon the table some fruit and bread and wine. "Eat, my son," said the old man; " the wine is good and the bread is quite fresh. These grapes are better than any in Hers." Gilbert seemed inclined to dispute the last assertion; but the length and vigor of his repast strongly confirmed the opin- ion expressed by his host. The latter re- mained standing with his arms folded on his breast, and regaraed the youth with a smile, as he indulged the keen appetite sharpened by the severe exercise of the day. The meal was made in silence, save an occasional entreaty from Gilbert to his entertainer to partake of his own cheer, and the refusal. The little lamp between them shone upon two noble faces: in spite of the great disparity between their ages, they were alike; not so much in feature as in the character of the head. The priest must have been near seventy.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     31 The top of his head was entirely bald; yet the little hair left him, which grew behind in a semicircle, from ear to ear, was only sprinkled with gray. He was tall and admirably formed for strength and agility; and though his cheek was pale and sunken, and his high broad forehead ploughed by many a heavy line, still in his eye and lips and nose were visible the relics oP a splen- did creation. There was an expression of great energy about his mouth; his whole face indicated intelligence and benevo- lence; and it was the actual possession of this energy, intellect, and virtue that made Father Omehr a worthy descendant of the noble emissaries of Adrian, who, ever in the rear of Charlemagne's armies, healed by the cross the wounds inflicted by the sword, and drove forever from the forests of Germany the gloomy and accursed rites of Hesus and Taranis. Gilbert de Hers was more than a fear- less hunter and skilful soldier. He had I   32   THE TRUCE OF GOD. been carefully instructed by his confessor in the writings of the fathers-in logic, philosophy, and the classics; he had read the death of Patroclus, and the episode of Nisus and Euryalus; he knew by heart many of those beautiful hymns whose authors, in the spirit of Catholic humility, had concealed their names. He was much beloved'by all who knew him and were permitted to love him. His charities were numerous and unostentatious. Though scarcely twenty-one, his bearing was bold and manly; there was no disguise about his large black eye; it spoke but all his thoughts before his tongue could tell them. Apart from the great beauty of his fea- tures, high thoughts had printed a language on his face much more fascinating than mere regularity of feature. His very ele- gant form did not promise extraordinary strength, yet he was as formidable to his foes as welcome to his friends. Gilbert rose at the conclusion of his   THE TRUCE OF GOD     33 rather protracted meal, and declared he would remain seated no longer while his companion stood. The priest carefully removed the relics, after: which he sat down upon the bench, and obliged the youth to sit beside him. "Now, my son," he said, " tell me what in the world has brought you here alone?" "No inclination of mine, my dear fa- ther," replied Gilbert. "Wtho has sent you, then?" "I am sent by chance," answered Gil- bert, laughing. "Early this morning I set out, with some twenty companions, in pursuit of a boar. I was better mounted than they, and so was the boar, for he dis- tanced them. When the chase was at an end I found myself entirely alone, and could hear nothing of my men. I did not know where I was; so I permitted my horse to choose his own course, and by some accident he has brought me here." C /   34   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Father Omelhr listened attentively, and added, after a pause: "It is well you came not yesterday. Did you meet any one in the wood?" Gilbert felt the searching eye of his companion upon him, and related with much embarrassment all that had hap- pened at the spring. "I knew he was in search of something to prey upon when he left me so suddenly. That Henry de Stramen should thus pur- sue a boy!-fie! It is a stain' upon his manhood!" Gilbert looked up in the speaker's face to ascertain if he were in earnest. "And but for that little bell, where would you be at this moment?" "Here, father, most likely!" This was said so calmly and maliciously, that Father Omehr could not repress a smile. But it quickly vanished, and left behind an expression of deep sorrow. "And must this fatal feud last forever?    THE TRUCE OF GOD.     35 was his passionate exclamation; "are ye ever to revel in carnage, like the lion of the desert - and shall the example of the Son of God inspire nothing but contempt for those who imitate him?" The missionary buried his face in his hands, and Gilbert, abashed by the solemn rebuke, kept a respectful silence. "O Gilbert! Gilbert!" resumed the priest, lifting his tearful eyes from the ground, "if your God submitted to insult and stripes and death to save you, can you not patiently endure for his sake a few slight injuries?" "Our injuries are not slight," replied the youth, "nor is the vengeance of the house of Stramen an idle threat. They have burned the houses of our serfs, des- olated our fields, butchered our kinsmen and dependants;--shall we not protect ourselves, even though our resistance makes their blood run freely?  They have accused my father of a crime of   36   THE TRUCE OF GOD. which he is innocent, and have sought to visit upon him real chastisement for the imaginary murder. Shall I stand still and tamely see them wreak their most unright- eous wrath upon my guiltless parent's head?" "I should be glad, my son, if you con- fined yourselves to mere resistance; but how often have you inflicted, within sight of this very door, the injuries of which you complain? Could you see whAat I see--the orphan's piteous face, the wid- owed mother's tear of agony-blighted hopes and unavailing regrets--you might pause in your fearful retaliation!" "( They have brought it on themselves," said Gilbert, musing; "they are the ag- gressors." "Alas! be not the means by whch their sins are aggravated." "You must address yourself to them!." returned the other. "And have I not? Day and night I have reasoned, implored, prayed; -I have   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     37 represented the folly, injustice, and impiety of their violence; I have held out to them the anger of God and the maledictions of man; I have employed art, eloquence, and reproof: but all in vain. Oh, what years of misery has your quarrel cost me! Could I only live to see it healed; to see you once more living like Christian men, employed in atoning for your own sins, not in arrogantly chastising each other's faults; to see the sword of discord broken, ! and peace and love and safety proclaiming the divine efficacy of our holy religion! We all have enough to do to vanquish ourselves, and have little time to spare in subduing others, unless we aid them in conquering their passions, and then we promote our salvation: but your conquests only peril your eternal welfare." Gilbert understood from this last remark that his companion had read what was passing in his mind, and he contented himself by saying: 4   38   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Believe me, father, I regret their ob- stinacy." "You are young now," pursued his monitor; "but, trust me, when your old limbs fail you, and your sight waxes dim, your angry deeds will rise like spectres around you and haunt you to the tomb." Gilbert attempted no reply, but listened with the air of one who approved the ad- vice but despaired of ever profiting by it. After an interval of meditation, Father Omehr arose and spread some soft fleeces in the corner of the room. "May you sleep soundly, my son," he said, "and beg of God grace to moderate your angry passions. Your bed is not very soft, but it is in your power to sanc- tify it, and then it will be better than the down which muffles those who disdain or neglect to invoke the Divine protection." Gilbert knelt down and received the old man's blessing, who, wishing him a good night, withdrew into his own apartment and closed the door.   CHAPTER II. The golden sceptre which thou didst reject, Is now an angry rod to bruise and break Thy disobedience. 8  EG   ILBERT DE HERS, as the good l  IB   p priest withdrew into his own apart- ment, resumed his seat upon the ezHj  bench, and soon became absorbed in med- itation. His varying face betrayed the character of each thought as it filed before his mind in rapid review. For more than an hour he remained in that statue-like state, when we, in a measure, assume a triple being, as the past and the present unite to form a future. But as all reveries, like life itself, must end, Gilbert at length seemed to be aware of the reality of the unpretending bed in the corner. Having repeated the prayers which his piety suggested, he extinguished the almost exhausted taper, and threw him- self upon the bed. He could not sleep, 39   40   THE TRUCE OF GOD. however; for, great as the fatigue of the day had been, the excitement was greater. His mind was perpetually recurring to the events at the spring, from which they wan- dered to his father's lonely and anxious chamber: now he remembered the earnest appeal of Father Omehr, and now pon- dered the injuries he had received from the house of Stramen. Through a narrow opening in the wall he could see the noble church sleeping in the moonlight, whose walls of variegated marble had been built principally at the expense of the Barons of Stramen; for in those days it was not unfrequent for private families to erect magnificent churches from their own re- sources; and as his eye rested upon the misty window, perhaps he felt that though utterly opposed in all else, there was one thing in common between his own haughty race and the founders of that church- religion. The night wore on, and was far ad-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     41 vanced; but Gilbert still kept piling thought upon thought, unable and even scarcely desiring to exchange them for the deep repose or more confused images of slumber. It must have been after mid- night when, as he lay awake, he could dis- tinctly hear the sound of blows. Gilbert was not a moment in conjecturing the cause; he knew at once that the venerable priest was subjecting himself to corporal chastisement. He did not live in an age when voluntary mortification was ridi- culed, when a sacred ambition to imitate a crucified God insured contempt from man. Then, those self-denying religious were not taunted with " the hope of gain- ing heaven by making earth a hell." And perhaps Gilbert knew that the spiritual peace and delight derived from such chas- tisements, were infinitely sweeter, even here below, than the impure pleasures of worldlings. Feeling thus, he could not but contrast the mortified life of that holy 4*   42   THE TRUCE OF GOD. man with his own indulged and pampered existence. He had never known the sting of adversity, and rarely been thwarted in a single desire; yet how much greater his sins than those of Father Omehr! Amid such reflections he felt - and it is a salu- tary feeling - the truth of an hereafter. But we will no longer pursue the reflec- tions of the youth. Some time after tile sounds had ceased he fell asleep, and was only roused by the sun streaming into his apartment, and the solemn tones of the church bell. Tlhe morning was beautiful. The sun was everywhere; kindling the hoary tops of the Suabian Alps, sparkling on thle broad Danube as it rolled majestically on from the southwest to the northeast, lighting up hamlet, hill, vale, rivulet, for- est, and making the church glitter like a stupendous diamond. But Gilbert was ill prepared to enjoy this blaze of beauty. In a melancholy mood he leaned against the   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     43 window, watching the sturdy serf in the centre of his family, as he came to share the blessings of the mass. He was rather startled when the outer door opened and admitted the lady he had seen in the church the night before with Henry de Stramen. She came unattended, save by an old female servant, who carried with   some difficulty a basket filled with fruits, delicacies, and medicines of various kinds, ji  designed for Father Omehr to apply to any purpose his piety might point out. Though in the year 1076, chivalry was not the regular and well-defined institution it became during and after the Crusades yet the same amount of valor and devo- tion to woman was expected from the knight. The spirit of Christianity, oper- ating upon Teutonic virtue, which has raised the female from the drudge of man to be the ornament of society, created a chivalric courtesy long before the cry of "Deus vult!" rang from Italy to England. 9   "   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Gilbert de Hers, born and bred in the courtly circle of Suabia, though his spurs were not yet won, was still familiar with the duties of knighthood. As the lady paused, surprised at his presence, he made a profound and respectful reverence, and he would have done the same had she been less noble, or had he known, as he then surmised, that the fair visitor was the daughter of his father's deadliest foe. Their embarrassment was relieved by the appearance of Father Omehr, who ex- tended to both his blessing, gratefully re- ceived the basket from the attendant, and, after Margaret de Stramen had retired, accompanied Gilbert to the church. As they emerged into the morning air, Gilbert caught a glimpse of the graceful figure of the young lady entering the church. But his attention was soon arrested by a strange, wild-looking being upon the church steps. She was apparently not over forty, tall,   THE TRUCE OF GOD.      45 slightly built, and evidently the victim of in- sanity. Her long black hair hung in thick masses over her pale face and deathly-white neck; her arms swung to and fro with a restless motion, and she sang at intervals snatches from the ballads for which Sua- bia is so renowned. As Gilbert passed her, she bent her large wild eyes upon him with an expression of such fearful meaning, that brave as was the youth in battle, he recoiled from. their ferocious glare. The next instant she was abstract- ed as before, and crossed her hands upon her breast in an attitude of devotion. Gil- bert looked to his companion with an in- quiring eye, but the priest was silent. The next instant they were treading the marble aisle. Gilbert knelt down upon a tombstone, and endeavored to compose himself for the mass. He perceived from the glances thrown upon him from time to time by some of the peasantry, that he was recognized as an enemy, yet respected as ,    ,   "   THE TRUCE OF GOD. one under the aegis of religion.    These glances became more frequent when Father Omehr, in his brief discourse, eloquently adverted to the example of Jesus in the forgiveness of injuries, and enforced the sacred duty of a Christian to imitate tlat divine model. In powerful terms the gray- haired priest portrayed the miseries of dis- cord, and the blessings of mutual forbear- ance; and Gilbert felt that a change was creeping over him. Ife left the church when the holy sacri- fice had been completed, meditating upon the pastor's powerful exhortation. But the train of his thoughts was broken upon the steps by that wild face almost touching his. As the maniac stared fixedly at himl, she muttered in a hoarse whisper: " They laid him 'neath a noisy tree, And his glossy head was bare; They piled the cold earth on his breast, Then left him helpless there." While the youth listened in amazement   THE TRUCE OF GOD.       47 and almost in terror, the frantic woman drew from  her bosom a long knife, and inflicted a deep wound upon him before he could wrench it from her determined grasp. The knife had penetrated to the rib, but not farther, having glanced off to the side.   As the blood spread rapidly over his hunting-shirt, the maniac gave a wild laugh, and repeated in the same low, dismal tone: "'T is red, 't is red, as red as-his; Man's blood is ever red; 'T was thus his side was crimsoned o'er When they told me he was dead." "With the last words, she laughed again, more wildly than before, and, darting into the wood, was soon lost among the gigan- tic trees. Some serfs were standing around, but offered no assistance. They seemed rooted to the ground in terror at the rash act, and crossed themselves in mute astonishment. At this juncture, while Gilbert was exam-   48   THE TRUCE OF GOD. ining the extent of the wound, and vainly endeavoring to stanch tile blood, the Lady Margaret and the priest appeared at the doorway, having been attracted by the loud laugh of Gilbert's assailant. Comprehending in an instant that Gil- bert had been wounded, Father Omehr hastened to support him. " It is but a trifle, father," said the youth, anxious to relieve the evident uneasiness of the old man. "May God will that it be so!" replied the priest, eagerly removing the hunting- shirt, and examining the path of the knife. After which, having carefully replaced the garment, he turned to the serfs who yet lingered there, inquiring, in a voice of deep indignation: " WVho has dared to do thlis ?  Who has been impious enough to draw blood during the truce of God, upon the tlhreshold of God's sacred temple? " One of them hastened to reply:    THE TRUCE OF GOD.   , 49  It was Albert of the Thorn's widow, crazy Bertha. God preserve us from 'such a deed, at such a time, and in such a place!" C "But could you not have prevented it?" continued the priest, eying the man until he quailed. Gilbert interposed. cThey are not to blame, father," he said; "I did not expect the attack myself, and none else could have prevented the blow." "It bleeds much," pursued the priest, again examining the wound. Gilbert made a step forward, but Father Omehr detained him, and reluctantly the youth allowed himself to be supported by two of the serfs of Stramen to the bed he had occupied during the night. Margaret de Stramen, in the spirit of the age, had gone to the cell after discov- ering the nature of the young man's in- jury, and taken from the basket she had brought some salves and stringents with 6 D   50   THE TRUCE OF GOD. which she stood ready at the door. She washed the wound and dressed it with the tenderness peculiar to woman, and received Gilbert's thanks with a slight inclination of the head. Having completed her task, she drew the priest aside, and, looking up into his face with evident emotion, said: "Could there have been poison on the knife?" Though spoken in a whisper, the youth must have heard it, for he smiled at first, and the next moment became pale as death. Father Oimehr noticed the change upon his features, and replied loud enough to be overheard: "No, no! it cannot be. Some moment- ary paroxysm prompted the deed; there could have been no preparation, no prede- termination." "It is not for his sake," continued Mar- garet, in a still lower tone, and withdraw- ing farther from the bed; " not for his sake I fear an unfortunate result; but for our   'THE TRUCE OF GOD,    51 own. I know that it is Gilbert de Hers who lies there, and I have drunk too deeply in the prejudices of our family to repine at any calamity that may befall him. But j this impious outrage can insure nothing but the Divine vengeance upon our heads. -If he were borne down in battle, I perhaps should rejoice at heart at the triumph of my father; but I would rather die than see him perish from a noble confidence in the house of Stramen." "You are not responsible, my child," rejoined her companion, "for the blind violence of a crazy woman. I am confi- dent that the wound is not dangerous.. Perhaps the accident, apparently so unto- ward, may in the end be productive of good. We are too apt to receive as good what should be avoided as evil, and to deem that a curse which should be consid- ered a blessing." The young lady made no reply, but ad- vanced to Gilbert's bedside.   52   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Believe me, sir," she began with dig- nity but in some confusion, "that I sin- cerely regret the accident which has con- fined you here, and that I desire and will pray for your speedy recovery. You can- not suspect the house of Stramen of con- niving at such a cowardly assault; they are too powerful in the field to resort to such a pitiful stratagem. Our effort shall now be to secure you from further vio- lence." The blood returned to Gilbert's cheek as she spoke. Feeble with pain and the loss of blood, he with difficulty replied: "I little expected ever to receive such kindness, as you have shown me, from the daughter of my father's foes; but come what may, kind lady, I shall never forget your services. I feel assured that the kinsmen of her whom I address, could never be guilty of so ignoble an action." It was not without pleasure that the noble maiden heard an answer so flatter-   THE TRUCE OF oOD.     53 ing to her pride, and so earnestly pro- nounced.. Her cheek became brighter than Gilbert's as she bowed and left the apartment, attended by the old female servant. We will leave Gilbert, for the present, in the care of Father Omehr, to follow the footsteps of the fair lady of Stramen. Margaret led the way rapidly to the border of the forest, where she had left a groom with horses. She sprang lightly upon her spirited palfrey, and exchanging a few words with the old woman, dis- missed both domestics to the castle, and galloped off alone in an opposite direction. As she rode along, she was greeted with smiles and blessings by all who met her; yet she seemed to heed but little the fre- quent reverence and heartfelt salutation. After proceeding about three miles, she struck into a deep, dark ravine, through which there rushed a slender stream, whose waters, seldom gladdened by a sunbeam, 5*    54   THE TRUCE OF GOD. seemed to groan and murmur like an angry captive. The way, thickly strewn with moss-bound stones and the moulder- ing skeletons of trees, required all the maiden's horsemanship. But she strug- gled on, until she reached something mid- way between a grotto and a hut, project- ing from the side of the gully, and look- ing as though by some fantastic freak of nature it had grown there, so admirably was it in keeping with the character of the place. From the time she had mounted her horse, the maiden's face expressed great anxiety, which increased as she alighted and entered the singular excrescence we have mentioned. A blazing pine-knot driven in the ground, shed a fierce and flickering light over the interior of this gloomy abode, for it was an abode -and more, a home - the home of Bertha! The maniac was sitting upon a rude bench, close to the firebrand which gave   THE' TRUCE OF GOD.     55 a fearful lustre to her haggard features, while with a species of exultation she gazed upon the lsife stained with Gil- bert's blood, still clenched in her hand. The husband of this unfortunate woman had, about a year before, been mortally wounded in a chance affray between the partisans of the lords of Hers and Stramen. He was brought home only to die in the arms of his wife. The shock had reduced her to this miserable extremity. She could not be prevailed upon to remain in the cottage she had occupied in the hour of her joy; and though repeatedly offered a home by Father Omehr and the Baron of- Stramen, she had built for herself this wild nest, and obstinately refused to leave it except to wander to the church or to the grave-yard. She was maintained by the Lady Margaret principally, and by the charities of the peasantry. Up to the present time, she had been perfectly harm- less, and was rather loved than feared by   56   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the children of the country. She had always manifested an extreme affection for the Lady Margaret, yo whom she would sing her sweetest songs, and whose hand she would almost devour with kisses. Margaret, though somewhat appalled at Bertha's frightful appearance, yet confid- ing in the power she had over her, ad- vanced and silently sat down upon the bench. For some minutes Bertha seemed unconscious of the presence of her visitor, ' but suddenly removing her eyes from tile knife, she bent them upon Margaret. In an instant a smile of strange sweetness stole over the poor creature's wasted face: every trace of anger disappeared as she fell upon her knees and raised the hem of the maiden's garment to her lips. With- out rising she sang one of those simple ballads which even insanity could not make her forget. The lady of Stramen patiently permitted her to proceed without interruption. But the moment her strange   THE TRUCE OF GOD.       57 companion was silent, she pointed to the knife, exclaiming: "Is this blood, Bertha?" Still kneeling, the woman began: "' The chieftain swore on bended knee, That blood for blood should flow-- Then leaped upon his coal-black steed, And spurred against the foe." "Has any one hurt you?" continued Margaret. But Bertha only replied: "Sir Arthur swung his falchion keen- The serf implored in vain ;- The knight is galloping away - The serf lies on the plain!" "Bertha! Bertha! this is wrong: I hop e you have committed no violence?" But the answer, as before, was given in rude, indefinite verse., It may be unnecessary to say that the object of the lady's visit was to discover if the knife had been poisoned.  Finding that all question would be useless, she had recourse to an artifice to effect her purpose,   58   THE TRUCE OF GOD. suggested by the discovery of a splinter buried in Bertha's thumb. "Let me remove this -it must give you pain," she said, examining the hand she had taken in hers, and reaching after the knife. Bertha passively resigned the weapon, but rapidly withdrew her hand, just as her mistress feigned to prepare for the incision. Margaret shuddered, for she naturally saw in that quick gesture a con- firmation of her worst fears. For some moments they gazed at each other in mute anxiety. Bertha was the first to break the silence, and her words revived a gleam of hope in the bosom of her companion. "No! no!" she exclaimed, slowly. and sternly, "his blood must not mix with mine t" "Is there poison here?" pursued the lady, in a low, searching tone. She received in reply: "There was no poison on the steel That robbed Sir James of breath;   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     959 There was no poison on the blade That well avenged his death." Greatly relieved, but still unsatisfied, the high-born damsel sprang to her feet. "It is the blood of Hers!" she cried, ex- ultingly. The maniac's face assumed a look of savage triumph.  I "Then will I keep this blood-stained in- strument as a precious jewel. Farewell, Bertha; you shall hear from me soon." She passed rapidly through the narrow aperture by which she had entered, leaving Bertha in blank amazement, utterly un- able to comprehend what had passed. Emerging from the dark ravine, the Lady Margaret rode straight toward the old castle of Stramen, whose gray towers retained their sombre majesty, which the merry sun could not entirely dispel. It was not long before she passed the draw- bridge, sped through the massive gate, and reined in her palfrey upon the ample   60   THE TRUCE- OF GOD. terrace; when, having thrown her bridle to an attendant, she proceeded at once to her chamber, and summoned Linda, the old domestic, to her side. "You are skilled in such matters, Linda," she said, producing the knife, before the faithful neif had finished her salutation; "is there poison on this blade?" Linda took the knife, and having ex- amined it attentively, returned it to her mistress; after which she left the room, making a signal that she would soon re- turn. After the lapse of a few minutes, she reappeared with a vessel of boiling water, which .she placed upon a marble slab. Then taking from her pocket a piece of polished silver, and at the same time receiving the knife, she plunged them both into the hissing liquid. As the lady of Stramen, eagerly watching the experi- ment, stood bending over the water with her back to the door, she was not aware   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     61 of her father's presence, who had entered unperceived, and was contemplating in some surprise the mysterious operation going on before him. He could scarce repress a laugh, for there was something ludicrous in Linda's very wise and con- sequential manner, as she knelt over the kettle, while his daughter, equally ab- sorbed, her hat-yet untied, continued in an attitude of profound attention beside her. Whllen the 'water had cooled, the old woman with a trembling hand drew out the silver--it was bright as ever! "It is venomless as the bill of the turtle- dove," she exclaimed, with the import- ance of an oracle, looking up at her mis- tress. "May I ask the meaning of all this, without being referred to the prince of magic for an answer?" said the Baron of Stramen, stepping forward; and he added, addressing Linda, who in her surprise had 6   62   THE TRUCE OF GOD. nearly overturned the vessel: "Do you wish to be hung for a witch?" The old woman slunk terrified into a corner, but Margaret hastily replied: "You are already informed, sir, of the violation of the truce of God, which oc- curred this morning. Our magic con- sisted only in the discovery that there was no poison upon the knife which inflicted the wound." "I cannot but think," rejoined her father, "that you have displayed an un- necessary interest about the result. That young stripling has cost me more lives than he numbers years; and though I could not connive at Bertha's attempt to assassinate, I certainly do not see much reason to rejoice at his escape." It may have been that Margaret quailed a little beneath her father's rigid scrutiny, but without embarrassment she returned: "If I had been born and bred to arms, if my breast were accustomed to the coat   ,H ITHE TRUCE OF GOD.        63 of mail, if my hand could wield the battle- axe, I might anxiously crave, or coldly behold the murder of a foe confiding in our generosity and in our plighted faith to the Church; but I have never worn the gauntlet, or drawn the sword; my heart has never exulted at the gladsome sight of an enemy's blood, and I scorn to P .xascribe the interest I may have shown, to !rt  a wish of having the sweet assurance that --i %a scion of Hers would perish like a dog, when in reality I hoped to find the weapon venomless." "Spoken like a woman, as you are," muttered the knight. "I would have you It   feel otherwise, but God has given you your sex; I cannot change its nature." The Baron of Stramen was a tall, pow- i erful man, whose vigor fifty years had not impaired. His face was stern, though not repulsive, and free from any approach to vulgarity. A man of strong passions, yet the strongest of all was an unvarying love   "   THE TRUCE OF GOD. for his daughter, on whom seemed to have centred all the tenderness of which he was capable. On the present occasion, he put an end to further controversy by drawing Margaret to his side, and giving her an exquisitely wrought head of Greg- ory VII. "Treasure it, my child," he said: "it is the faithful likeness of a wonderful man -a man who may one day, with a few stout hearts to second his energy, chastise the impious tyranny of the house of Fran- conia!" He spoke with deep feeling, and, after pacing the room, with his arms folded upon his broad breast, abruptly stalked through the door, apparently absorbed in some momentous question. No sooner had he gone, than Margaret turned to Linda, who still occupied the corner, and dismissed her with a message to Father Omehr. When alone, she knelt d wn before an ivory image of the Blessed   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     65 Virgin and prayed -not to the polished ivory-but to the mother of purity whose intercession it suggested, with a fervency and constancy which only they venture to ridicule who cannot record the virtues of Mary without a sneer. Though not apprehensive, Father Omehr was pleased to learn from Linda that the knife had not been poisoned. Gilbert's eye brightened at the intelligence, though he had not given utterance to his fears;- fears they were -for even the young and brave recoil in terror from death, when it assumes a form and hovers near in a de- tested shape. Having informed the youth that a messenger had been despatched to his father, the priest left Gilbert in charge of the sacristan, and proceeded on his daily errand of mercy through the neigh- borhood. By men like him, fervent, fear- less, faithful, the rude northern hordes were induced to abandon their idolatry, and embrace the faith of the Church of a6*     E w  ,         f I   ,   "   THE TRU'CE OF GOD. Rome. These noble missionaries slowly but surely prepared the canvas on which were afterward laid, in colors of enduring brightness, the features of Christian civil- ization. When Father Omehr returned, Gilbert was asleep. The sacristan put in his hands a letter from a distinguished prelate, in- forming him of the nomination of Henry canon of Verdun, by Henry IV. "O God, protect thy holy Church!" ex- claimed the missionary, crushing the paper in his excitement. ' If the ministers of God become the creatures of the king, des- potism and irreligion must inevitably en- sue. How long will virtue be accounted a crime? Shall every faithful shepherd be supplanted, to make room for file wolf of lay investiture, the instrument of a lustful tyrant, raised by simony, and upheld by royal favor?" Gilbert's light slumber had been broken by the elevated voice of his benefactor,   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     67 As soon as Father Omehr saw the youth awake, he approached him, and inquired, with great kindness of manner, whether he felt better. The youth replied in the affirmative. "I have discovered," continued the other, "that you have richly deserved this wound. You killed with your own hand the husband of the woman who stabbed you, and though the chance thrust of an affray, it was noted, and communi- cated to Bertha by an eye-witness, one of the combatants. This is her revenge- but how inadequate to her suffering!" "It is, indeed," said Gilbert, replying to the last remark, which had been partic- ularly emphasized. His companion could not conceal the satisfaction with which he hailed this re- ply, as an omen of regret, and of a right apprehension of his former violence. But the youth was drowsy, and pru- dence forbade a longer conversation. At   68   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the close of the evening service, the lady of Stramen was seen to exchange a few words with her venerable pastor, but she did not enter the cell. The gorgeous sun of ancient Suabia was beneath the horizon-- but Gilbert slept upon his couch; the moon had lit her feebler torch, and walked silently beneath the stars - yet not until midnight did Gil- bert awake.   All was profoundly still. Tlle dim light of the taper, at his bedside, revealed only the motionless figure of the sacristan, and the outline of a crucifix halnging against the wall. Iis eyes invol- untarily closed, and in a moment he stood before his father, in the oaken halls of Hers--his retainers were around him- the horses pranced merrily--the  bugle soundedl --"On to the chase!" was the cry.  He opened his eyes-the 'crucifix became more distinct. He knelt before a prince, and arose a kni(rht- a  broidered kerchief streamed   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     69 from his polished casque - the herald, in trumpet tones, proclaimed his prowess-- the troubadour embalmed his deeds in immortal verse -the smiles of high-born damsels were lavished upon him - the em- ulous page clasped his sword at the men- tion of his name. He opened his eyes - the crucifix, and the sacristan! A form of beauty was before him - at first, haughty and disdainful, but gradually assuming a look of interest and pity--it bent over him, and poured a balm into his wound, with a prayer for its efficacy - but the figure lifted its finger with a menacing air, and pointed to a snake, hissing from its hair--a mist settled around him, and the apparition was gone. He opened his eyes--the taper burned brighter--the crucifix became more distinct. Gilbert was now fully awake.  His wound was more painful than it had yet been, and in vain he endeavored to win back the repose so lately enjoyed. Nor i     i   70    THE TRUCE OF GOD. was corporal uneasiness his only annoy- ance. Father Omelhr's revelation of the motives by which Bertha was actuated, Lad left a more painful impression upon his mincd than his monitor perhaps desired. Though the priest had not directly attrib- uted the woman's insanity to her husband's death, Gilbert too clearly understood that such was the fact. His was too generous a heart, not to deplore bitterly so terrible a calamity, of which he was -- however unintentionally--tthe cause. He felt no resentment for his misguided assailant-- he would willingly have exposed himself to a second attack, could he have thu restored her reason. The memento of the crucifixion-that Catholic alphabet, the crucifix -held up unto his soul the won- drous truth that God had voluntarily suf: fered, for the sake of man, all that human- ity can endure; and the youth interiorly acknowledged that the errors of his life were but imperfectly balanced by the in convenience he then experienced.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.      71 It is not in the pride of health and youth, surrounded by pleasure, and strangers to care, that a heart, wedded to the world, is apt to prostrate itself in humility before the Author of life; but in danger and af- fliction, we learn to mistrust our self-suffi- ciency, and feel our complete dependence upon an invisible and almighty power. We are much more disposed to appeal to Heaven for protection, than to return thanks for repeated favors. It is not to be wondered at, then, that Gilbert sought relief in prayer; there is nothing more natural to one who prefers the consolations of religion to the staff of philosophy. He was far indeed from that exalted perfection of loving God for himself alone; but who can predict what may spring from   the mustard-seed? By the first gray light of the-morning, Father Omehr was bending over his youth- ful charge: Gilbert was fast asleep.   CHAPTER III. "Fit to govern! No, not to live. O nation miserable, With an untitled tyrant, bloody-sceptred, When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again?" MACBETE HE third Friday after Gilbert ha( been wounded, he mounted hi horse, and, accompanied by Fa ther Omehr, set out for the Castle of Hers which lay some four leagues distant to thl south. "You are sad, father," said the youth who felt all the exhilaration of returniri strength, heightened by the freshness of the morning. "It is true, my son; for though in al the trials of this pilgrimage I endeavor t( turn to God the cheerful face he loves t see in affliction, I am sometimes weal enough to tremble at the gloomy perio( before us. We are upon the eve of a tre "   THE TRUCE OF GOD.      73 mendous struggle. You may not be aware of it, for you are unaccustomed to watch events which govern the future for good or evil; but the firmness of our holy father, and the increasing recklessness and impiety of the emperor, must create an earthquake sooner or later." X"My father," replied Gilbert, " has im- puted to his holiness a want of firmness." "Alas, with how little reason! He who, when seized by Cencius and his armed as- sassins at the altar of St. Mary Major - bruised, and dragged by the hair to the castle of his assailant -yet remained calm and unmoved with the face of an angel, neither imploring mercy nor attempting an ineffectual resistance canutot be ac- cused of a want of firmness. 'The match- less benevolence - the heart which melts at the first symptom of repentance- the clemency which led him, while his wounds were yet fresh, to pardon 'Cencius, pros- trate at his feet-have also induced him "11 -    -    }.'i:   !    74    THE TRUCE o01 GOD. to hearken to the promises of King Henry and accept his contrition." " But is it not almost folly to trust the royal hypocrite to whom  Suabia pays so heavy a tribute! I wish that when his infant majesty fell in the Rhine, there had been no Count Ecbert nigh to rescue him!" " Is it not rather an exalted charity, of which you have no conception, and a Chris- tian forgiveness which puts to shame your last ungenerous wish ?  "I can have no sympathy or pity for him who has loaded with insult a prin- cess alike distinguished for .beauty and virtue." "You mean the queen, his wife.

We will no longer continue a conversa- tion which, to be intelligible to all, would require a more intimate acquaintance with the history of the times than can be ob- tained from the- books in free circulation among us. Though Gregory VII. has been reproached by all Protestants, and by some Catholics, with an undue assumption of temporal power, and an unnecessary severity against Henry IV. of Austria, it is certain that, in his own day, he was charged by many of his own friends, par- ticularly in Saxony and Suabia, with too tender a regard for a monarch who vio- lated his most solemn engagements the moment he fancied he could do so with impunity, and whose court, already openly profligate, threatened to present the ap- pearance of an Eastern seraglio. A hasty glance at the prominent facts of the dispute will leave us in doubt whether to admire most the dignified and Christian forbear- ance of the Pope while a hope of saving   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     " his adversary remained, or the unwavering resolution he displayed, even ko death in exile, when convinced that mercy to the king would be injustice to God. No sooner had Gregory assumed the tiara, than he addressed letters to different persons, in which he assures them of his earnest desire to unite with Henry in up- holding the honor of the Church and the  imperial dignity; to accomplish which he will embrace the first opportunity of send- ing legates to Henry, to acquaint the king with his views. But, while proffering his love, he declares that, if Henry shall ven- ture to offer God insult instead of honor, he will not fail in his duty tO the Divine Head of the Church through fear of offend- ing man. So, in a letter to Rodolph, Duke of Suabia, who at that time was known to be secretly hostile to the king, Gregory de- clares that he entertains no ill feeling what- ever for Henry, but simply desires to do his duty. 7*   78   THE TRUCE OF GOD. There were two evils which Gregory was resolved to extirpate: lay investitures, and the incontinence of the clergy. While the power of appointing to benefices was usurped by the civil power, the emperor was sure to fill the highest places in his gift with creatures of his own. The in- evitable result of this was to create two classes of prelates - one of lay, the other of ecclesiastical investiture. Its ultimate effect was to render the Church complete- ly dependent upon the State, and to change and corrupt its very source with the vary- ing vices of libertine despots. It was found (and how could it be otherwise?) that the proteges of the emperor studied only how to please him; and that, in serving the state and the prince, they became indiffer- ent to the Church. Selected to serve a par- ticular purpose, or chosen in consideration of a valuable donation, the lay nominee had been sure to fulfil the object for which he was elevated, or to indulge the avarice   THE TRUCE OF GOI.     79 or ambition which had craved the appoint- ment. It was in attempting to remedy this fatal innovation that Gregory found himself repeatedly "thwarted by Henry; and yet he has been censured by those who lament the worldliness of a portion of the medieval clergy, for striking at the root of the evil. After repeated provocation, the arm of the Pope is uplifted to strike; but Henry, awed by his menaces, and by an insurrec- tion in Saxony, hastens to avert the blow by an unreserved submission and the fair- est promises. He confesses, not only to have meddled in ecclesiastical matters, but to have unjustly stripped churches of their pastors-to have sold them to un- worthy objects polluted with simony, whose very ordination was questionable -and im- plores the Pope to begin the reform with the cathedral of Milan, which is in schism by his fault. Gregory pardons him; and, in 1074,   80   THE TRUCE OF GOD. holds his first council at Rome against simony and the incontinence of the clergy. It was in this year that Henry, already pressed by the Saxons and Thuringians, found himself threatened by Salomon, King of Hungary. In this emergency, he has recourse to Gregory, who, by an eloquent letter, calms the indignant Hungarian. With the year following the campaign against Saxony begins. This brave but tur-  bulent people had risen against the towns in possession of Henry, and burned the magnificent cathedral at Hartzburg. Here again the Pope secured to the king the powerful assistance of Rodolph, Duke of Suabia, in conjunction with whom the royal army obtains a decisive victory at  Hohenburg. But once in security and crowned with success, the graceless mon- arch forgets his submission, and exclaims, "It does not befit a hero, who has van- quished a warlike people, struggling in defence of what they hold most sacred, to   THE TRUCE OF POD.     81 bow humbly down before a priest, whose only weapon is his tongue!"Faithless to his recorded vow in the hour of danger, he nominates Henry, canon of Verdun, to fill the see vacated by the bishop of LiBge; and, soon after, calls to the see of Milan, Theobald, his own chaplain, in place of the murdered Herlembaud. Thus repeat- edly deceived, Gregory must strike at last, or sacrifice the independence of the Church of God to human weakness. It. was in the pause between these new indignities and the consecration of Hi- dolphe in the archbishopric of Cologne, that Father Omehr and Gilbert rode slow- ly on toward the Castle of Hers. The conversation naturally turned from the consideration of impending evils, to the miserable feud actually existing be- tween the two houses of Hers and Stramen. "I sincerely wish it were ended," said Gilbert, in'reply to a vehement denuncia- tion just pronounced by his companion. F   .    \  .           .   82   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "I could willingly forgive all the injuries I have received at their hands, when I remember the kindness of the Lady Mar- garet." The priest looked quickly up in the young man's face, but Gilbert was gazing with an abstracted air upon the blue out- line of the beautiful Lake of Constance, which just began to appear to the south. "It were far better," he said, command- ing the youth's attention by taking his hand - " it were far better to forgive them when you remember the prayer of your dying Jesus for his persecutors, than out of gratitude to the ordinary courtesy of a pitying damsel." Gilbert made no direct reply, nor did he return the glance of his friend, which he well knew was upon him. "I could wish," he began, after a con- siderable payse, " before leaving your hos- pitable roof/to have expressed to the Lady Margaret my deep sense of the interest she   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    83 deigned to display in my regard, and which I fear has done more to soften my feelings toward her father, than the nobler and holier motive you have mentioned." There was a humility in this that pleased the good missionary; but he saw with pain and uneasiness the direction which the ardent mind of the youth was evidently taking, and instantly rejoined: "Did you know the Lady Margaret bet- ter, you would spare yourself that regret In her charitable attention to your wants, she overcame a natural repugnance to your- self. She would rather miss than receive any return you can make, and is always more inclined to set a proper value upon the solid and eternal recompense of God, than attach any importance to the empty and interested gratitude of man." Gilbert's eyes were bent again upon the Lake of Constance. They were now at the foot of a long, high hill, which they began to ascend in silence. Gilbert pressed his   84   THE TRUCE OF GOD. horse rather swiftly up the gradual ascent, and they soon gained the summit. "What is the Danube to that splendid lake!" cried the mercurial stripling; "and what is there in all the lordship of Stramen to vie with this!" The view now opened might excuse his excitement, even in a less interested per- son. The Castle of Hers, though built for strength, presented a very different appear- ance from that of Stramen : its outline was  light and graceful, and it seemed rather to lift up than cumber the tall hill that it so elegantly crowned. It was situated upon the border of the lake, which, by trouvere and troubadour, in song and .in verse, in every age and in every clime, has been so justly celebrated. A few miles to the southwest the mighty Rhine came tumbling in; who, as the German poets say, scorns to mingle his mountain stream with the quiet waters of the lake. We will attempt no further description, for fear of spoiling   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     85 a finer picture, which must already exist in the eye of the reader, created by more skilful hands. As the horsemen neared the castle, they saw a knight, followed by a few men, dash- ing down the hill. Gilbert knew his father, and'hastened to meet him. Their meeting was manly and cordial. The baron stopped but to embrace his son, and hastened to welcome Father Omehr. Jle dismounted, and imprinted a kiss upon the old man's still vigorous hand. "I should be childless now," he said, "but for your kindness; and you know that words would but mock my feelings." The tears in the baron's eyes expressed moid than a long oration. Father Omehr only replied, with a laugh, "You must blame your son's indiscre- tion, and not applaud me!"Thus saved' from a formal and unsatisfactory conver- sation, the knight remounted his horse and led the way to the castle. 8   86   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Upon the slope of the hill, half-way be- tween the castle and the lake, was a chapel built of white stone, which had stood there, according to tradition, from the ninth cen- tury. It was said to have been erected by Charlemagne, on his second expedition against the Saxons. The Baron of Hers had ornamented and repaired it with much taste and at great expense, until it was cel- ebrated throughout the circle of Suabia for its richness and elegance. It had been dedicated to Mary the Morning Star, as appeared from a statue of the Blessed Vir- gin surmounted with a star, and was called the Pilgrim's Chapel. It was in charge of Herman, a priest, who had studied at Monte Casing under the Benedictines, with Father Omehr, whom he loved like a brother. They had 'spent the long purga- tion and been ordained together; and, for forty years, they had labored in the same vineyard, side by side, and yet seldom meeting. When they did meet, however,   THE TRUCE (   GOD.    87- it was with the joy and chastened affection which only the pure-ninded and truly re- ligious can know; and they would recall with tears of happiness the scenes of other days -the splendid convent, whose church shone like a grotto of jewels and precious stones-the learned and devout monk, and the theological difficulties over which they had triumphed hand in hand. After taking some slight refreshment, (for the baron could ill brook a refusal of his cheer,) Father Omehr left the father and son to each other, and began to de- scend the path to the chapel. Herman had gone to administer the last sacraments to a distant parishioner. Father Omehr knelt down in the chapel and awaited his return. It did not seem long before his brother missionary entered through the sacristy and knelt beside him. The little chapel was very beautiful, with its branching pil- lars, supporting clusters of angels carved in stone. The images of the saints served   .    .   88   THE TRUCE OF GOD. to awaken many fine emotions - and the principal statue of Our Lady, which the artist had designed to represent the im- maculate purity of the Mother of God- gave an indescribable sweetness to that consecrated spot: but more beautiful still, and more acceptable to God, were the two holy men who, bent with age and grown gray in the service of a Heavenly Master, bowed down together before the altar of the Most High, and for a time forgot each other in the contemplation of the majesty and infinite goodness of him they served. At length they rose; and when in the open air gave way to the impulse of hu- man love, which until then had yielded to a loftier feeling.  There was a room in the Castle of Hers in which Herman spent the hours not rA- quired for the active duties of his ninistry, and to this the two friends retired. There, for more than an hour, they discussed top- ics of mutual interest - compared the con-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     89 dition of their flocks - and wandered back to Naples and Monte Casino. The intro- duction of this last subject seemed to re- mind Herman of something he had forgot- ten; for he started up and went to a shelf, which was filled with extracts he had been permitted to make from the celebrated library of the convent, and taking down a small piece of parchment, gave it to his companion. It was an illuminated manu- script of the "Salve Regina." "It was sent me yesterday across the lake by a Benedictine monk," he said, when Father Omehr had finished reading and raised his eyes in wonder and delight. "And who has written it?" "A namesake of minel-- a Benedictine. It was not seen until after his death, when the manuscript was discovered in his cell. What is more remarkable is that the monk  was distinguished for nothing but his pie- ty, and had never made any pretension to learning or accomplishment." 8*   90   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Much to the surprise of Ilerman, his friend, though deeply moved by that beau- tiful effusion of Catholic piety, seemed not to give the entire attention which it so eminently deserved. "Listen!" he said, repeating the lines. "'What melody! what tenderness! what love! You certainly must feel its exalted piety?" he added, appealing to Father Omehr. "I do, indeed; but you perceive that I am disturbed. In brief, then - for I could not bring myself to say it until now Anno of Cologne is dead." Anno, Archbishop of Cologne, was re- vered throughout Europe in the eleventh century for his virtue and wisdom. It is said of him that, when others slept, he rose, filled with a holy zeal, and visited many churches, carrying with him his pious offerings. In the halls of kings, says the poet who celebrates his virtues, he sat with the haughtiness of the lion; in the   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     91 hut of the peasant, he stood with the hu- mility of a lamb. So obnoxious was he to the king, that Henry at one time assaulted him sword in hand; and he was only saved from death by the interposition of a monk. Alone, he founded five monasteries, in- cluding that of Siegherg, his favorite resi- dence, where he died, and where his tomb was long pointed out to the traveller. He was said to have emitted a light, the splen- dor and beauty of which spread around like the lustre of a precious stone in a ring of gold. O God, the giver of all!" exclaimed Herman, after a pause, " in taking him to thyself, do not leave us desolate!" Father Omehr then described the fearful ulcers which had tormented his body, and the celestial visions and brilliant appari- tions that delighted his soul and foresha- dowed the bliss awaiting him in the life to come. "But let us not weep for him whose   92   THE TRUCE OF GOD. epitaph is in the mouths of the widow and the orphan, and whose soul is in the hand of God!" said the pious chaplain of Hers, grasping the hand of his friend.  "Not for him I weep," was the reply; "nor yet for the bereaved people of Co- logne." The missionary paused, unable to proceed, and then hurriedly exclaimed, "Who is to be his successor? Who is to appoint him? - Gregory VII. or Henry of Austria!" "He will not dare!" ejaculated the other, who not until this moment clearly under- stood his more keen-sighted friend. "He who has dared to fill the sees of Liege and Milan may not scruple to pol- lute the see of Cologne! But let us pray and hope; for suffer what we may, we cannot be conquered." This long interview was here terminated by the bell of the Benedicite, summon- ing to dinner. The Baron of Hers was noted for his fine person and his polished   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     93 address, and saluted them with even more than his usual politeness as they entered the dining-room. He was the only one of the group who seemed at ease; for the two minsionaries could not forget the death of Anno- and Gilbert, from some cause or other, had lost his sprightliness. "I fear," said the knight to Father Omehr, "that you have half made a trai- tor of Gilbert, for he will no longer let me abuse my friends at Stramen, but sides with them against me. It is hard to fight our battles all alone, and against our friends, after forty." "The Lady Margaret, who dressed his wound, must be blamed- not I," replied the priest. The handsome face of the Baron of Hers, in an instant, became black as night, and as quickly recovered its former mildness; butthe change, apparently, was not noticed by him who had caused it. "I have heard," resumed the knight, K   "   THE TRUCE OF GOD. in a careless tone, "that the young lady possesses much virtue, intelligence, and beauty; and is wise enough to prefer the cloister to the court." "You have not been misinformed; yet her health is so feeble, that the grave will probably anticipate her choice of either." It was not until the close of the meal that the Lord of Hers was informed of the death of the Archbishop of Cologne, and from that time until they rose the conversation turned wholly upon the venerated and saintly prelate. Toward sunset they descended the hill and walked along the picturesque banks of the lake. The noble sheet of water stretched away to the south far as the eye could reach, burnished by the sun, and forming part of the horizon. "This lake of ours," said the baron, has obtained a reputation which the best man cannot expect--and, indeed, would not   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     95 desire: no one has ever breathed a word againat it:" "There is a boat!" interposed Gilbert, pointing to a speck in the distance, which his father discovered after a long search, and was invisible to their two older com- panions. They stood in the shadow of some trees, and watched the object as it increased in size and gradually assumed the undeniable outline of a boat. It came from the direction of Zurich, and pointed directly to the castle. As it neared, they could distinguish four stout rowers and a person seated in the stern. With increased speed it seemed -for it was now within hailing distance - the boat darted straight to where they were standing; and, before it was made fast, the gentleman in the stern sprang ashore, and, removing the cloak in which he had been enveloped, discovered the princely features of Rodolph, Duke of Suabia. Rodolph was descended from the counts   96    THE TRUCE OF GOD. of Iapsburg, on the father's side-and on tie mothler's, from the illustrious family of Otto the Great. He was styled King of Arles, and resided for the most part at Zurich. He was connected with Henry of Austria by a double tie: Matilda, his first wife, having been the sister of the king, and Adelaide, to whom he was then married, being the sister of the queen. But, though thus allied to Henry, he neither loved nor respected him. Once, indeed, the emperor had summoned him to court, on the charge of entertaining projects hostile to the house of Franconia; but .Rodolph, well knowing the treacher- ous character of the monarch, and always a hero, boldly refused, preferring the for- tune of arms to the fate of an investiga- tion. Subsequently, filled with horror at the impiety of the Saxons in burning the cathedral at Hlartzburg, hallowed by nu- merous relics, and filled with the rich offerings of the faithful, he had united   THE TRUCE OF GOD,     97 with Henry to chastise .heir sacrilege.

This refusal had been dictated by the knight's invincible repugnance to Hen- ry, and by the politic motive of conciliat- ing all who opposed the emperor. Since the battle of Hohenburg they had not met. After receiving the formal salutation due to his rank, Rodolph cordially em- braced the Lord of Hers, and extended his regards to Gilbert, who could not suffi- ciently admire the hero of Hohenburg. "But for your father's obstinacy," he said to the youth, "you would now be a knight. But I will see you win your spurs yet." The greetings over, they all began to ascend the hill. The duke would not pass the chapel without entering. The pave- ment upon which they knelt had been worked with many a rich and curious de.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     99 vice; but time and the knees of the faith- ful had worn away most of the finest trace.- ry. At the foot of one of the columns still remained this fragment of an inscrip- tion:   a "Hoc pavimentum .... .feci ... . ductus amore Dei." This was the spot upon which the duke loved to kneel. Before rising, he drew from under his robe a golden chalice, and gave it to Herman, who was' beside him. The priest took it and carried it to the sanctuary. "I would almost give the decade of Jura,"exclaimed Rodolph, as he approached the castle gate, "to know who made that superb pavement." "It resembles more the pavement of a cathedral than the simple floor of a cha- pel," said Father Omehr. "I wish we had such an one to our little church at Stramen." "Trust that to your successor," replied   100   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the duke; " you have given him the walls, the pillars, the windows, and the roof, and' are well entitled to a pavement and ala- baster altar at his hands." They were now at the gate, into which were cut two niches containing statues of SS. Victor and Apollinare. The bars, which yielded to every stranger and to every peasant, flew open before the high- born group, and the almoner, as he recog- nized the duke, bent his knee in reverence. They mounted a heavy flight of stairs, and, traversing an arched gallery, were ushered into the principal hall. This large room was hung with solemn tapestry, reaching from the ceiling to the floor. The charac. teristic piety of these ages displayed it. self in the beautiful recesses in the walls, adapted to the reception of holy water, and in the devices upon the floor and ceil- ing, which always conveyed some pious meaning. The walls were covered with paintings, chiefly relating to the exploits   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     101 of the lords of Hers, or filled up with her- aldic blazonry. In the cathedral or in the castle, in the monastery or in the chapel, durability was the principal object of the architect. It is true that the genius of the age contrived to combine the greatest strength with the greatest elegance; but durability was the great end. The pious men of the middle ages did not erect mere shells, which, though sufficient for their own brief lives, would crumble over their posterity; but looked to the wants of future generations. And, then, there was a reliance upon pos- terity which is neither felt nor warranted now. Thus, in the minor Church of the Nativity in the lordship of Stramen, which had been designed by Father Omehr, and which had exhausted the revenues of the barony, the missionary had conceived it upon a scale to which his present means were insufficient, but to which the charity of another generation would be adequate. 9*   102   THE TRUCE OF GOD. This was always the case with the cathe- drals. Even the castles themselves had so many rooms set apart for recluses and wan- derers, that it was easy to convert them into monasteries; and the Castle of Hers, with very little alteration, would have made an excellent convent. IRodolph was about to throw himself into one of the large high-back chairs of state; but yielding a graceful respect to the aged priests, he motioned them to be seated, and placed himself between them. "You are rather pale, my lord duke, from your wounds," said the baron, as an attendant entered with some wine-cups- "and I beg you to accept from my son a draught of the vintage you used to relish." Rodolph received the goblet from the youth, and replied, as he raised it to his lips, "How I missed you at Hohen- burg!" "I would have given my lordship," re- turned the baron, " to have seen you out-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    103 stripping all the chivalry of Austria, and charging where none dared to follow!" "My fair cousin, the Margrave Udo, would have atoned for the thrust at my face, which made me see more stars than were ever created, had you been at my side." "But to aid you was to assist Henry; and I was loth, to break our league with Saxony." "That league was merely defensive, and they broke it by aggression and sacrilege." "But we could not punish their crime without strengthening the power of that greater criminal, the emperor." "You acted uncharitably," said the duke; "but you judged aright, and I have forgiven you." "For which, my liege," replied the baron, "I cannot be too grateful." "Listen," continued the King of Arles, "ye true pastors of the Church of God, and you, Albert of Hers, that Henry of   104   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Austria has nominated a successor to Anno of Cologne!" At this announcement Herman and the knight sprang to their feet, while their looks expressed their horror and surprise. But Father Omehr kept his seat, and said calmly: "Will your highness inform us more fully?" The duke resumed : "A messenger, post haste from Goslar, brought me the news this morning at Zurich. Henry refused to meet the Pope in council to take measures for the purification of Milan, Firmano, and Spoleto, and has thus replied to the threat of excommunication. The nominee is Hidolph, who is attached to his own chapel, a man of no merit whatever, but devoted to the emperor; and whose prin- cipal endeavor it has been, to remedy by art the unprepossessing exterior which na- ture has given him." "I know him," said Father Omehr. is he yet consecrated?"   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    105 "No! All Germany is indignant at the choice, and the people of Cologne are im- ploring the monarch to make another ap- pointment." "It will serve but to confirm the nomi- nation," said the priest of Stramen. "What remains to his holiness?" in- quired Rodolph.  Slowly and solemnly the missionary  pronounced the single word - ' Excommunication!" "Henry is preparing for it!" exclaimed the duke, rising and, addressing the Lord of Hers; "he convened at Goslar- all who respected his summons--among whom was the Duke of Bohemia: and he has liberated Otto of Nordheim, my adversary at Hohenburg, an'd received him into his' most secret councils. It must come, my  friend," he added, grasping the baron's hand; "we shall not be separated here; and, if I mistake not, we have in Gilbert one who is not to be awed by the lion of Franconia!"'   106   THE TRUCE OF GOD.-. Father Omehr beheld with sorrow the meaning glances of the proud nobles, as they eagerly joined hands; and he read in the animated features of the hero of Ho- henburg that the impending excommuni- cation would be the signal for a revolt. He rose, and, exchanging a few words in an undertone with Herman, explained the necessity he was under of returning at once to the Castle of Stramen. "I will accompany you," said the duke, "if you will delay your departure a few minutes." Father Omehr expressed his assent, and retired to the chapel with Herman, leaving the two knights in close converse. Gil- Jert ran to order the best horse for the duke, and to see that his venerable bene- factor should want nothing to carry him safely over the intervening hills. After exchanging many kind adieus, Rodolph and the missionary, near the close of twi- light, started for the Castle of Stramen.   CHAPTER   IV. "Contra cujus ictum plane Ad haec Simonis leprosam Execrate hberesim, Sacerdotum simul atque Scelus adulterii, Laicorum dominatus Cedat ab ecclesiis." ST. PETER DAMAN. HE King of Aries and the mission- ary rode along without an escort, and felt none of the fears that the traveller of the times is often made to en- tertain for his personal safety. They did not apprehend any violence, and their only  preparation for the expedition had been a recommendation to God through our Lady and the saints. It is as purely imaginative in historians and novelists - and it is. diffi- cult indeed to distinguish the one from the other--to surround every castle with a wall of banditti, as to station in Catholic countries of the present day, a robber or 107   108   THE TRUCE OF GOD an assassin behind every tree. In the mid- dle ages, the stranger could wander from castle to castle with as little danger as the nature of the country pernmted; even in times of war, the blind, the young, the sick, and the clergy were privileged from out- rage, though found on hostile territory. And in war, peace, or truce, the pilgrim's shallop was a passport through Christen- dom; he was under the special protection of the Pope, and to thwart his pious designs was to incur excommunication. Even amid the terrors of invasion, the laDorer was free to pursue his occupation, and his flocks and his herds were secure from molestation; for it was beneath the dignity Of the man-at-arms to trample upon the person or property of the poor un- armed peasant. Such were the principles recognized even in the eleventh century; and though we witness frequent departures from these admirable provisions, we must be careful not to mistake the exception for   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    109 the rule, or to impute to the spirit of the age a violence and contempt of authority common to all times, and found alike in Norman and Frank, American and Mexi- can. To balance these infringements of regular warfare or "blessed peace," we often meet with instances as beautiful as the march of Duke Louis, the husband of St. Elizabeth, into Franconia, in 1225, to obtain reparation for injuries inflicted on p alpeddler. "I hope the Baron of Stramen has lost none of his vigor," said the duke; "we were together at Hohenburg, and I may need him at my 1side again. His son Henry, too, whom I knighted before the battle, and who won his spurs so nobly, how is he?" "They were both well," replied Father Omehr, " when I saw them last, and were anxiously expecting a visit from their liege." "And the Lady Margaret, from whom 10   "O   THE TRUCE OF GOD. not a knight can boast a token, though all are striving to obtain one?" "She has not altered since you saw her," answered the priest; "she was al- ways rather frail, but I do not gee that she grows weaker." "You cannot imagine," interposed Ro- dolph, " how much it grieves me to be un- able to reconcile these two families whom I so dearly love, and who, in the camp or in the chamber, have proved themselves so devotedly attached to me. I cannot even ask of one in the hearing of the other, without giving offence or receiving a bit- ter answer. In all things else, they are obedient as this horse to his rein; but the moment I speak of reconciliation, the stubborn neck is arched, and will not relax either for threats or entreaties." 'Your grief cannot equal mine," re- turned the missionary, " and I confess, that without the hope of obtaining assistance from heaven, I should despair of ever soft-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     1" ening the determined animosity of the Baron of Stramen. The Lord of Hers, perhaps, might be induced to throw en- mity aside, if his adversary relented; but he cannot be persuaded to sue for peace, especially when his supplication might be unavailing." "I cannot believe," continued the duke, "that my friend of Hers could have killed Robert of Stramen, since he- most posi- tively denies it. It is true that their re- lations were anything but amicable, yet Albert of Hers would, scorn to take a knight at a disadvantage, and would not attempt to conceal the result of a mortal struggle. If Robert of Stramen fell by his hand, it must have been in fair combat; and if in a fair tilt, there is no motive for concealment." "But the circumstances are strong enough to amount to conviction in an angry brother's eyes. A woman, who has since lost her mind, named Bertha, her  "2   THE TRUCE OF GOD. father, and her husband, all swore to have seen Sir Albert ride away from the spot a short time before the body was found; and the scarf of the Lord of Hers was clutched convulsively in the dead man's hand. The wound upon the head resembled that pro- duced by hurling a mace, and was of such a character that the head could not have been protected by any steel piece. I do not consider this conclusive against the Lord of Hers, or even incapable of explana- tion; but real and unequivocal guilt itself could not justify the untiring malignity of the Baron of Stramen. His brother's soul would be much better honored by his prayers, than by imprecations and the clash of steel; we cannot avenge the dead, for their bodies are dust, and their souls absorbed in things eternal; and Sandrit de Stramen is but making his brother's misfortune the occasion of his own tempo- ral, and perhaps eternal injury. I wish,   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    113 indeed, this criminal work of vengeance could be stopped." "Yes," replied the duke, "they had better husband their energies, for if I read the future aright, Suabia will have need of every nerve." Rodolph paused here; and as his com- panion did not reply, they rode on in si- lence. "I have a plan," exclaimed the duke, with singular vivacity. "But tell me first, has that young Gilbert seen the Lady Mar- garet?" In reply the missionary briefly narrated the events of which the reader is already in possession. "Then," pursued the King of Aries, eagerly, "I have strong hopes of success. Listen to me, holy father: the maiden is beautiful and virtuous, the youth fair and knightly, and I can so represent one to the other, as to create an attachment strong enough to insure to filial love a victory 10*     H   "4   THE TRUCE OF GOD. over parental hate. It is fair, I think, to employ the bodily graces of these young persons against the mental deformity of their parents - t array the child against the father, when we seek the triumph of innocence over sin." "Your highness is inclined to be ro- mantic," rejoined the priest. "Only the circumstances are romantic, and they seem to have shaped themselves; my plan is practical enough. Tell me- what think you of it?" "Briefly, then, I think your project im- practicable." "Impracticable! you cannot know, father, all that love and youth will dare; but I, whose earthly life has given me ex- perience in such matters, have seen the impossibilities of sober minds yield to the irresistible energy of two plighted hearts. Oh, no; it is not impracticable." "I will grant you," replied the mission- ary, " that these two young, persons might   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    115 be brought to love each other, that they might marry in spite of family opposition, but the result would make your romance a tragedy." "How so?" inquired the duke. "May we not deem without impiety that God, int his mercy, has designed them for the ex- tirpation of this miserable feud, and has drawn out of the stern parents themselves the instruments by which their hearts may be softened?" "It is impossible," said Father Omehr, "for us to discover by any human' means what the mercy of God may appoint; all we can do is to ask for light to guide our steps, and to exercise the reason with which he has endowed us. I have good ground to believe that any approach to tenderness, on the part of the children, would widen the breach between the fa- thers. And were such the case, the con- summation of your plan would give only a new and horrible feature to the present   "6   THE TRUCE OF GOD. discord, by severing the bond between child and parent. For, unless I am much de- ceived, the lords of Hers and Stramen would turn away in disgust from children whom they would consider, not only to have disobeyed them, but to have proved faithless to their race. In this view, I can not suppose that Heaven indicates the path to final reconciliation through fresh dis- sension. The hearts of the parents can- not be softened in the way your highness proposed, and that must be the first step in your plan. Besides, I have little confi- dence in the agency of a human and self- ish love to reach an end that ought to be gained by purer motives. I have dis- covered, from observation, what the power you spoke of will dare; I know its great- ness and its littl ness." "I must tax my ingenuity for a more auspicious scheme," resumed Rodolph of Suabia, "for I begin to be distrustful of my first. I was a little romantic, I con-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    117 fess; but it is thus we give the rein to some solitary impulse of youth, lingering, like a firebrand, among our more matured resolves."  They had ridden slowly, and were now on the brink of the ravine, three miles from the Castle of Stramen. The waning moon and the bright starlight showed them a white figure standing in the road, a few paces from the mouth of the gorge. "Who is that before us?" asked the noble. "Bertha, the poor crazy woman, who swore to the presence of the Lord of Hers at the spot where Robert de Stramen was found," whispered the priest, and he ad- vanced to where she stood. "I heard your horse's hoofs, father," she said, "and I came to get your blessing." And you shall have it, Bertha," he answered, extending his hands over her head. "Good night," -he added, seeing that she did not move.   "8   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Who isthis you have brought us?" continued the woman, pointing to the duke. That," replied Father Omehr, "is Rodolph, Duke of Suabia, and King of Aries."d Bertha approached the duke,knelt don , and kissed his hand. She then wal ked slowly up the ravine.        , "A singular being," exclaimed the duket as they gave their horses the spur, for it was growing late. (c I have irot seen any one thus afflicted for many years, and it is always a painful sight." The two horsemen were now at the church, but they passed it and kept on to the castle; and hearty was the welcome of the noble duke to the halls of Stramen castle. Sir Sandrit's eyes gleamed with delight as he saluted his liege; Henry's cheek flushed with pleasure when Rodolph, the flower of German chivalry, spoke of his youthful prowess at Hohenburg; the   THE TRUCE   OF GOD.   119 Lady Margaret loved the duke for the praises he heaped upon her brother. Nor were the domestics gazing -idly on; but kept gliding to and fro, and hurrying here and there until the genial board was spread, and the fish, fresh from the Da- nube, smoked, and the goblet gleamedl. As it was near midnight whell they sat down, Father Omehr felt at liberty to leave the room without cerenmony.   The Lady Margaret stayed no longer tilan courtesy demanded, when she rose and retired to her chamber. This young lady had always been noted for her piety and her charities to -the poor, whose wants she was sure to discover and supply. Under the skilful and fervent training of Father Omehr, she had learned to repress a spirit, perhaps naturally quick and imperious, and to prac- tise on everyv occasion a humility very dfif- ficult to haughty natures. There was even some austerity in her devotion; for she would subject herself to rigorous fasts and   120   THE TRUCE OF GOD. to weary vigils, and deay herself the lux- uries that ler father delighted in procur- ing= for her, little dreaming that they were secretly dispensed to the sick of the neigh- borhood. She never failed to hear mass, unless prevented by sickness or some other controlling cause, but every morning laid a bunch of fresh and fragant flowers upon the altar of our Blessed Mother. And who shall say that the sweet lilies of the field, the roses and the violets,. colored with the hues of the dawn, and freshened in the dew of the twilight, when offered and consecrated by the homage of an inno- cent heart, are not grateful to her whose purity they typify! Yet there was a lurk- ing family pride in Margaret's heart that she could not entirely eradicate, and a sleeping antipathy to the house of Hers that at times betrayed itself to her watch-' ful self-examination. The reader must not imagine that, when she told the missionary at Gilbert's bedside that had the youth   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     121 fallen in battle she perhaps would rejoice, she actually desired such an event. She spoke to one who knew her better. Slie felt this antipathy, but did not know its extent; and, with the humility of virtue, she feared that, although engaged in an act of charity, there might 'be the fiend of re- venge at the bottom of her soul. Margo ret do Stramen was not blind to her imper- fections, and she did not hesitate to impute to herself an inclination to the unchristian ) hate so cherished by her family. But she endeavored to overcome it by prayer, by the sacraments, by penance, and by pon- dering the splendid example of Jesus of Nazareth. The Lady Margaret was not one of those fair and fanciful creations, endowed with such exquisite sensibilities 'as to perceive and return the admiration of a young knight-errant with whom   she had been associated by any romantic circumstance. Nor was her disposition of that impulsive   122   THE TRUCE OF GOD. kind which will permit the impression of a moment to overthrow the prejudices of years. But to her joy and surprise, she found that, far from rejoicing at Gilbert's misfortune, she had regretted it; and re- gretted it, not merely because it millght stigmatize the fair name of Stramen, but also in obedience to'an elevated generosity that sickened, ungratified, at the sight of obtained revenge. She had been almost constrained to render assistance to the youth; and there are some who think the stinog of a favor worse than the fang of an injury, and are more disposed to forgive after having benefited. With the facility peculiar to a gifted woman, she had read in Gilbert's face the ingenuousness and goodness of his heart, and though she did not ascribe to him any exalted qualities, she admitted that it was not easy to be- lieve him guilty of cruelty or meanness. In a word, the sympathies of the woman were now arrayed against family pride and   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     123 family prejudice, and a trial still more dan- gerous and severe awaited her piety and  resolution. In the morning, after hearing mass, she found the duke ,and -her father in close conversation, while her brother was busily preparing for some important event. It was soon evident that Rodolph was about to depart, and that Henry was to accom- pany him; for the grooms led to the door two handsome and stalwart steeds, richly caparisoned, and four mounted men-at- arms rode up and halted upon the terrace, where they waited motionless as statues of steel. When their private conference was over, the duke advanced, and took the Lady Margaret by the hand. "I am selfish enough," he said, "to de- prive you of your brother for a few weeks, to assist me by his counsel, and protect me by his arm, should it be necessary, in a little adventure we have resolved to undertake."               ;   124   THE TRUCE OF GODS "I am too true to you, my lord," re- plied Margaret, " to desire my brother's society, when you request his assistance. Were I a young knight, I -should esteem it no light favor to march- no matter where - as an escort to Rodolph, Duke of Suabia." "And I, fair maiden," returned the duke, "could wander to the end of the world   i with such ,a companion."           "I hope you may not find Henry so agreeable as to carry you so far, for I ex- pect to welcome you back in a week." "If I consulted my pleasure," said Ro- dolph, "I should not be absent a day, but my duty may detain me a month. I will not offer an apology for so long a stay, be- cause I fear that before sunset you will have ceased to think of me, or remember me only in connection with your brother." "A noble duke,' replied the lady, ' whose name is heard wherever the nin- strel tunes his harp, whose word was neVer   i; THE TRUCE 0r GOD.     125 plighted in vain, wrhose sword was never stained in an unrighteous cause, whose arm and purse are ever at the command of the poor and persecuted, whose courage and clemency, wisdom and piety, so well entitle him to the love of all his people, is not so easily forgotten." "I assure you, on my honor," exclaimed. Rodolph, ," that I value your words more than all the songs of all the minstrels I ever heard. I would I were worthy your praise; but you have inspired me to de- serve it. Farewell! I see that Henry is impatient, and we must not lose the early morning."  He   bade adieu to the bcaron and his daughter, and turned to mount his horse, when Bertha touched his arm, and placed in his hand something enveloped in silk. Bertha said not one word, but she looked earnestly up in Rodolph's face, and then walked away as swiftly and silently as she came. The duke could not help remark  -   126   THE TRUTE OF GOD. ing the wild beauty of her pale and wasted face, and remained some moments gazing after her with a painful interest. He re- moved the silk and found that it contained a ring garnished with a stone of rare value. He started as his eye fell upon the trinket, for he remembered that years ago he had given it to the Lord of Hers. How could it have come into Bertha's possession, was the question that naturally occurred to him; but the answer came not so readily as the question. While the duke was thus pondering, Henry had embraced his fa- ther and sister, and leaped upon his horse. Rodolph mounted slowly, after examining the girths with his own hand; and the lit- tle troop, waving a parting salute, swept over the drawhridge, and were sooni lost among the trees. About the same hour, or a little earlier, the Lord of Hers, with a small retinue, had set out in an opposite direction, but on the same mission. Rodolph had long seen that   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    127 Ring Henry's unprincipled ambition threat- ened the liberties of religion and of Aus- tria, and he only paused for the papal ex- communication to throw off all allegiance to a monarch who could not be safely trusted. That excommunication was im- pending, and, as may be easily conjectured, the duke was making a rapid, circuit of his dominions, to unite his barons more closely to his interests; to warn them to prepare for the approaching struggle; to confirm the weak and wavering in their fidelity; inspire the resolves of those who were true and firm, and make all the pulses of the circle of Suabia throb in concert to the action of one grand moving power. To gain time, the Lord of Hers had been de- spatched to the provinces bordering upon the Rhine with letters from Rodolph to the principal barons there, while the duke himself, with Henry of Stramen, followed the Danube. For many months there had been no \, (   128   THE TRUCE OF GOD. active warfare between the hostile houses, though the feud had lost none of its venom. But age was stiffening the impetuosity of the old barons; and their sons, no longer urged on by the battle-cry of their sires, listened with more attention to the advice and representations of their spiritual in- structors. Gilbert of Hers was not inclined to take an injury to his breast,-and hug it there; but the bold and frequent incursions of Henry of Stramen had induced him to retaliate rather in a spirit of rivalry than of revenge. Henry of Stramen inherited all his father's implacability, but he had often yielded to his sister's solicitation to dedicate to the chase the day he had de- voted to a descent upon the lordship of Hers. The troubled condition of Ger- many had also diverted the chiefs from the disputes of their firesides to the civil wars of the empire; and neither the Lord of Hers nor the Baron of Stramen gave much attention to aught else than the league that   THE TRU6E OF GOD.    129 Rodolph was forming against Henry IV. of the house of Franconia. Gilbert, left almost Without a compan- ion-for the good priest Herman, whose time was divided between his pastoral du- ties, his prayers, and his studies, saw him but at intervals found time to hang very heavily upon his hands. He thought the old reaper weary and sluggish, for the scythe flies fast only when, we employ or enjoy the moments. The autumn blast was beginning to lend a thousand bright colors to the trees, and the giddy leaves, like giddy mortals, threw off their simple green for the gaudy livery that was but a prelude to their fall for the beauty that, like the dying note of the swan, was but the beauty of death. It was the season of all others for the chase, that health- giving but dangerous pastime, which our ancestors pursued with almost incredible eagerness, hunting the stag or the boar, over hill and dale, bog and jungle, through I   130   THE TRUCJ OF GOD. every twist and turn, as their Anglo-Saxon descendants -now pursue the flying dollar. But Gilbert often declined the urgent in- vitation of the forester to fly the falcon, rarely indulging in his favorite amusement. He preferred to wander along the borders of the magnificent Lake of Constance, or to loiter among the neighboring hills, and watch, from some bare peak, the broad- winged vulture sailing slowly and steadily through the skies. He would watch it until it became a mere speck in the blue distance: we may often catch ourselves gazing after receding objects as though they were bearing away a thought we had fixed upon them. His wound was nearly well, and the freshness of health was again in his cheeks; lbut his spirit had lost a part of its sprightliness, and he seemed to have grown older. He did not evince his for- rner relish for the manuscripts of Herman, but his visits to the chapel were more fre- quent and lasted longer. Thus, day after   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     131 day, he would study the lake, the clouds, and the cliffs, neither fearing an attack from the men of Stramen, nor meditating one against them. We shall leave him in his inactivity, to trace the progress of events which form one of the most important and exciting periods in history. Rodolph was not a moment too soon in concentrating his power; for Henry IV., flushed with his recent victory over the Saxons, had called at Gcslar a diet of the princes of the empire, under the pretext of deciding, in their presence, the fate of their Saxon prisoners. Only a small mi- nority of the princes obeyed the summons; but the real object of the king became evi- dent when he made them swear to exalt, upon his own death, Conrad his son, a minor, to the throne. In the mean time, the news of the nomination of Hidolph, as successor to the sainted Anno, had spread to Rome. The Pope beheld with profound [   132   THE TRUCE OF GOD. sorrow the obstinacy and ambition of the king. Henry was not to be driven from his purpose by the universal contempt this nomination excited, and he replied to the repeated remonstrances of the citizens of Cologne, that they must content them- selves with Hidolph or with a vacant see. And his firmness triumphed over the pop- ular indignation; for Hidolph was invest- ed by the king with the' crozier and the ring, and finally consecrated archbishop of Cologne. But his victory was not complete. He had yet to cope with an adversary more formidable than popular opposition; one who would not yield tootemporal tyran- ny the watch-towers and guardian rights of spiritual libertvy. That adversary was George V1I.  Already the tremendous threat had issued: "Appear at Rome on a given day to answer the charges against you, or you shall be excommunicated and cast from the body of the Church." But   THE TRUOE OF GOD.     133 the infatuated monarch, too proud to re- cede, hurried on by his impetuous arro- gance, and by the unprincipled favorites and corrupt prelates who shared his boun-  ty, loaded the papal legates with scorn and contumely, and drove them from his pres- ence. Ite did not even wait for the sen- tence, of excommunication to fall, that now hung by a hair above his ]ead, but began the attack, as if resolved to have the ad- vantage of the first blow. Couriers are despatched to every part of the empire, with commands to all the prelates and nobles upon whom   lie could rely, to as- semble at Worms, where he promised to meet them   without .fail.  Twenty-four bishops and a -great number of laymen hastened to obey the summons. The con- venticle sat three days, and the following charges were formally preferred against the Pope:  "That he had by force extracted a solemn oath from the clergy not to adhere to the king, nor fo favor or obey any other 12   134   THE TRUCE OF GOD. pope than himself; that he had falsely in- terpreted the Scriptures; that he had ex- communicated the king without legal or canonical examination, and without the consent of the cardinals; that he had con- / spired against the life of the king; that, in spite of the remonstrances of his cardinals, he had cast the body and blood of our Lord into the flames; that he had arrogated to himself the gift of prophecy; that he had connived at an attempted assassination of the king; that he had' condemned and ex- ecuted three men without a judgment or an  admission of their guilt; that he kept con- stantly about his person a book of magic." So palpably absurd and false were these charges that three of the assembled pre- lates refused to sign an instrument for the deposition of a pontiff, so little conform- ing to the ancient discipline, and unsup- ported by witnesses worthy of belief. Nor were Henry's machinations confined to Germany, but he ransacked Lombardy   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     135 and the marches of Ancona for bishops to sign these articles of condemnation, and even aspired to infect Rome itself by presents and specious promises. But the golden ass could not then leap the walls of Christian Rome. Gregory's principal accuser was the Cardinal Itugues le Blanc, whom he had previously excommunicated. This ambi- tious man rose in the, council and taunted the Pope with his low extraction, at the same time charging him with crimes that were proved to be the offspring of calumny and error. He produced a forged letter, purporting to come in the name of the archbishops, bishops, and cardinals, from the senate and people of Rome, inveigh- ing against the Pope, and clamoring for , the election of another head of the Church. Encouraged by imperial patronagej and stimulated by a desire to rid himself of disgrace by sullying the hand that had branded him, the   excommunicated car- ,   ,   136   THE TRUCE OF GOD. dinal did not hesitate to call the Pope a heretic, an adulterer, a sanguinary beast of prey. The emperor himself knew Gregory too well to believe such a tissue of absurdity; but he hoped to find others more credulous than himself. Upon the accusations already specified,  and the invectives of Hugues le Blanc, the assemblage of prelates at Worms re- solve upon the deposition of Gregory Vli. It is then that Henry steps forth, as the life and soul of the conventicle, armed with its decree, and addresses an insult- ing letter to the Pope, inscribed "Henry, king by the grace of God, to Hildebrand." In this letter, the decree of the conventicle is lost in the insolence of the king. "I,c is the language of the missive, "I have followed their advice, because it seemed to me just. I refuse to acknowledge you Pope, and in the capacity of patron of Rome command you to vacate the holy- see." Can the most jaundiced eye, can   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     137 the man who learned, even in- his boy- hood, to loathe the name of Hildebrand, read these expressions without confessing that the king was the aggressor, and that if the Christian Church had a right to ex- pect protection from its appointed head, X Gregory V L. was called upon to vindi- cate the majesty and liberty of religion so grossly outraged in his person? Surely it will not be asserted at this day that the head of the State, by virtue of his tem- ,poral power, should be the head of the Church; or does that beautiful logic still exist, which denied an absolute spiritual supremacy in the successor of St. Peter, yet admitted it as an incidental prerogative to the crown of England? But we have yet to see the last act of this attempted deposition. A clerk of Parma, named Roland, was charged with the delivery of this letter, and the decrees of the conventicle of 'Worms. A synod had b'een convoked in 12*              '   138   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the church of Lateran, and the Pope, sur- rounded by his bishops, occupied a chair elevated above the rest. Roland's mission had been kept a profound secret, and, when he appeared before the conclave, not a prelate there could guess his pur- pose. They had not hleard the voice that had gone forth from -Worms. But they did not long remain in suspense. Turn- ing to the Pope, the envoy thus began: "The king, my master, and all the ultra- montane and Italian bishops, command you to resign, at once, the throne of St. Peter and the government of the Roman Church, which you have usurped; for you cannot justly claim so exalted a dignity without the approbation of the bishops X and the confirmation of the emperor!" Then addressing the clergy, he thus con- tinued: "My brothers, it is my duty to inform you, that you must appear before the king at the approaching festival of Pentecost, to receive a pope from his   '        THE TRUCE OF GOD.    139 hand; for the tiara is now worn, not by a pope, but by a devouring wolf!" Receive a pope from'the king! receive from Caesar what he must usurp to bestow! Had Gregory flinched, the independence of the Church would have been sacrificed, and her acknowledged inability to cope with royal vices would have permitted every European, monarch to change his queen with his courtiers. Henry IV. would have had his successor to Bertha;- Philip Augustus his Agnes de Meranie; and Henry VHI. his (ranmer and his scaf- fold without one moment's opposition. But no sooner had Roland pronounced those last words, than the Bishop of lEorto leaped from his chair, and cried out: "Seize him!"The prefect and nobles of Rome and the soldiers drew their swords, and, in their sudden fury, would have killed the audacious envoy, had not'Gre- gory, repeating his magnanimity to Cen- Cius, covered the clerk with his own body, l *    "O   THE TRUCE OF GOD. and by his calmness anld eloquence con- trolled the indignation and disgust of his too zealous friends. "My friends!" he said, with all the dignity of human greatness, elevated and purified by the most exalted piety, " dis- turb not the peace of the Church. Behold the dangerous times, of which the Scrip- ture speaks; are come, when men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, and disobedient to parents. We cannot escape these scandals; and God has said that he has sent us like sheep in the midst of wolves. It is necessary for us then to combine the innocence of the dove with the prudence of the serpent. Now, when the precursor of Antichrist erects himself against the Church, he must find us inno- cent and prudent; these dispositions con- stitute wisdom. We must hate no one, but bear with the madmen who would violate the law of God. -Remember that God, descending a second time among   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    141 men, proclaims aloud: 'He who would follow me must forsake himself!' We have lived in peace long enough, and God wishes that the harvest should again be moistened with the blood of his saints. Let us prepare for martyrdom, if it shall be needed, for the law of God, and resolve that nothing shall sever us from the charity of Jesus Christ." The synod, in breathless interet, lis- tened to the holy pontiff who then pro- ceeded with wonderful composure to read the charges that had been preferred against him. Among Roland's letters was another signed, "Henry, king not by usurpation, but by the grace of God, to Hildebrand, false monk and anti-pope." This was couched, if possible, in language more in- sulting than the former. One sentence will show the temper of the document, and prove that the king was struggling to build up a monarchy of divine rights and appointment. "A true Pope, Saint Leo,   /1 "2   THE TRUCE OF GOD. says, Fear God! honor the king! ' But as you do not fear God, neither do you honor me whom he has appointed king." Can any expression more clearly indicate that Henry of Austria had resolved to crush a pontiff who stood between him and un- questioned despotism, and .that he aimed-  at a heaven-commissioned temporal power, often conceded, it is true, but never by  Catholicity. The letter concludes with- these words: "I, Henry, king by the grace, of God, warn you, with all our bishops: descend! descend!" When the Pope had finished reading the invectives of ITenry and those who were weak, enough, to second his ambition, so great was the exasperation of the synod, that he adjourned it to meet the nextday. When the morrow came, in the presence of a hundred and ten bishops, he recited his former indulgence to Henry, his pater- nal remonstrances, and his repeated proofs of love and goodness. The whole assem- I   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    143 bly rose in a body, and implored him to anathematize a perjured prince, ap op- pressor, and a tyrant, declaring that they would never abandon the Pope, and that they were ready to die in his defence. It was then that Gregory VII. rose and pro- nounced, amid the unanimous acclama- tions of the synod, the sentence of excom- munication against the emperor. Thus went forth this awful thunderbolt for the first time against a crowned head. A dissolute and ambitious monarch had called upon the successor of St. Peter to yield up the keys, and lay the tiara at the feet of the lion of Austria, because that successor had declared an invincible deter- mination to preserve the purity of tile Church and its liberties, at the sacrifice of life itself. The tyrant struck in anger, and the pontiff, incapable of yielding, gave the blow at last; for the temple of religion was insulted and invaded. It is easy, when calmly seated at a win-   "4   THE TRUCE OF GOD. ter's fireside, to charge Gregory VII. with an undue assumption of temporal power. But he who will study the critical position of Europe during the eleventh century, must bow down in reverence before the mighty mind of him who seized the mo- ment to proclaim amid the storm the in- dependence of the Christian Church. Was not his resistance to Henry expedient? Yes! And to one who knows that the Church was the lever by which the world was raised from barbarism to civilization, and will confess, with Guizot, that with- out a visible head Christianity would have perished in the shock that convulsed Eu- rope to its centre, the truth is revealed, as it was to the master mind of Gregory, that had he pursued any other course, peace and unity, as far as human eye ex- tends, would have perished with the com- promised liberty of the Church of Rome. Let us rejoice, then, that this sainted pon- tiff hurled against the Austrian tyrant the   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    145 anathema on which was written--The in- dependence of the Church of God shall be sustained, though the thrones of princes crumtle around her, or though her min- isters are driven to seal their fidelity with death. 18    - EK k\ 4     CHAPTER   V.

OR three weeks the Lady Margaret had expected the duke and her -   brother; for three weeks Gilbert had impatiently awaited his father's return. Toward the close of September, a group of young children might be seen clustering around an old man, at the edge of the for- ' est, within a stone's throw of the church of the Nativity. They were listening eagerly and delightedly to the patriarch they had surrounded, in whom we recog- nize Father Omehr.   The faces of the in- fant band were bright with innocence and that happy alchemy which turns the merest "6   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    147 toy to a costly treasure. There was a ten- der piety on the features of those children that moved the heart. Devotion lies upon the face of youth with a peculiar fitness. As we see it dwelling in that unsullied abode, we remember how the cheek of the Madonna is pressed against the infant in her arms. Their instructor seemed to have caught a portion of their light-heartednress. Sad recollections and gloomy anticipations were forgotten; the throes of the empire and dangers of the Church intruded not; for a moment, the aged missionary felt the elasticity of childhood, and, as his heart was as pure, his face became as bright as theirs. "Perhaps you have thought, my chil- dren," the priest was saying, while his hand rested lightly upon the head of the nearest boy, "perhaps you have thought at times, that had you been little children at Jerusalem when our Saviour entered the city in triumph, and the people went forth to meet him with palm-branches,   "8   THE TRUCE OF GOD. you too would have run to welcome him, and laid fruits and pretty flowers at his feet. Perhaps you have thought that you would have offered him some refreshing drink as he tottered under his cross up the hill of Calvary; that you would have em- braced him and wept most piteously when he fainted away in agony. How delight- ful would it have been to receive a smile from your suffering Lord! You have still the very same opportunity, my children, you would have had at Jerhsalem. You can still run to meet your Redeemer! He loves the flowers of a pure heart, better than those which make the green fields as beautiful as the blue sky with its stars; and he values the tears we shed for our sins, more than the pain we would have felt to see him suffer. Still continue to bring the fruits and flowers of piety and obedience to your parents to Jesus, and you will be permitted to wait upon him in heaven for all eternity.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     149 "Go, now, and play! And when the bell rings, come quietly to the church." Not until his little flock had dispersed did Father Omehr perceive that the Lady Margaret was standing almost at his side. The Lady Margaret has changed since we saw her return the parting salute of Ro- dolph and Henry. Her cheek has grown brighter, but her brow is smoother and paler. Her face is sweeter than ever, though still more melancholy. It may have been the balminiess of the afternoon, solicitude for her brother's return, or a transient feel- ing, that controlled the expression of the maiden's face, but it seemed to have still less of earth in its exquisite proportions, and her eye was softer and deeper. It was Monday afternoon; and on this day eveir week, the missionary instructed the children of the neighborhood and pre- pared them for communion. There still remained an hour before the time for even- ing service, and Father Omehr proposed 138 * # * ) e  X}'     150   THE TRUCE OF GOD. to the Lady Margaret a walk along the shady avenue at the border of the forest. Disengaging herself from the children, who loved her and were clustering about her, she readily assented. "Father," began the maiden, as they walked together, " when may we expect the duke?" "Before long, I hope," replied the mis- sionary; " the conventicle at Worms will decide at onee Apwho of his barons are for and who against him. I should not be surprised to see them retuLLrnig at any momnent." "Are they in no danger from ill-disposed chieftains?" asked the lady. "The duke will pass through a friendly country, and is too much loved and feared to be assailed in his own'dominions. Your father, I presume, is not anxious about their safety?" "Oh, no! He talks as if they were in- vulnerable."   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     151 "At least," returned the priest, "you should rest content with praying for them, and not distress yourself with idle fears." A pause of some minutes ensued here, during which Margaret's mind seemed act- ively and painfully employed. She broke the silence by exclaiming, in a low but earnest tone: "I have always been too much influ- enced by idle fears--my whole life has been a tissue of timidity." "Do not accuse yourself unjustly, my child," said her companion; " we must be- ware, even in reproaching ourselves, that we do not despise the favors of God, and lose the grace of perseverance in virtue." The fair girl was again silent, but she suddenly exclaimed, with much emotion': "Year after year I felt a strong impulse to join the convent at Cologne, founded by the sainted Anno, but was withheld by a fear of my  own weakness; I resolved to seek the cloister and forget the garb and   152   THE TRUCE OF GOD. customs of the world, but I feared that I might thus confirm my father in his indif- ference to religion and my brother- in his antipathy to the house of Hers. The months kept gliding by, and still I was irresolute. I have prayed, with al the ardor I could command, for light to see my vocation; and if God have llercifully granted it, I wilfully remain blind. This self-made uncertainty and irresolution cost me many a pang; nor have I even the merit of patiently and cheerfully enduring what they inflict." Margaret was violently agitated as she spoke, but was not entirely subdued by her excited heart, though more than one big tear went down her cheeks. "Margaret!" said her venerable com- panion, stopping short and speaking so impressively that the maiden looked up through her tears. "Margaret!" he repeated, as their eyes met, "you have done much to soften your   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     153 father's anger and your brother's im- petuosity, and your mediation has perhaps endeared you to heaven; - but you can do more! Devote your life to the extinguish- ment of the feud between the houses of Stramen and Hers- look to the duty that stares you in the face, and fulfil that vo- cation before you seek another! Make peace between these houses the first ob- ject of your prayers, and the aim of all your efforts, and God will soon determine whether the cloister or the castle requires your presence in the accomplishment of your noble end!" As Father Omehr concluded, the Lady Margaret, yielding to the impulse she had till then controlled, wept like a child. Yet it was not deeper dejection that made her sob as though her heart would break, but rather a sense of relief, and a sweet con- solation that banished all spiritual dryness. Her instructor had often before suggested her obligation to consecrate herself to the ,    154   THE TRUCE OF GOD. task of healing the feud; but never had he so solemnly warned her, and never had she seen her duty so clearly. "Be calm, my child," continued the missionary; "you can compose yourself in the church, while I prepare for the ser- vice. Prostrate yourself before the infinite majesty and goodness of God, and invoke his assistance, with a determination to ac- cept with resignation whatever trial he may send. And forget not to suppli- cate the intercession of the blessed Mary. Open your heart to her; beg her to dis- cover and obtain its pious wants. She, whom Jesus obeyed on earth, will not ask in vain in his eternal kingdom: God, who made her the medium of salvation to man while she remained a poor Jewish virgin, cannot deem her unworthy of being the channel of his choicest graces to us, now that she stands, beatified in heaven!  The Lady Margaret passed into the church and knelt before the altar. There   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     155 she remained until the psalms were sung and the evening hymn was over. When she rose, her face was calm, and even joy- ous. There was no exultation in her look, but it was full of meek serenity. As she left the church, she met Father Omehr. She greeted him with a smile that told what a load was taken off her heart. There was gratitude, esteem, and a holy joy in that smile -it was full of a tender and indescribable sweetness it was an expression of the happiness and purity of her soul. It was not the bright smile of youth, or the warm smile of affection; it had none of the witchery of woman, but much of the devotion of the saint: beautiful as she was, and still more beautiful as it made her, it suggested the Creator, not the crea- ture. "We shall expect you to-night, father," she said, pausing but a moment. Father Omehr nodded, and dismissed the e       s Hr      i,   156   THE TRUCE OF GOD. children, who had come for a parting bless- ing,'wlile the maiden turned her palfrey toward the castle. She rode swiftly, for dark clouds were climbing up the horizon, and the wind was sighing heavily among the trees. We shall leave the maiden on her trusty steed, and see how it is with Gilbert at the Castle of Hers. His wound had healed; but he refrained from the vio- lent exercises to which he had been much addicted. He felt the separation from his father keenly, foi they had not been parted a week for many years, and the Lord of Hers, besides being a kind parent, was a most agreeable companion. Yet there was something more than this, that weighed upon his mind, and kept down the buoy- ancy and sprightliness of his ardent tem- perament. By day and by nilit, there was one fatal sound ringing in his ears. On the lake, on the cliffs, on the skies, on the fields, he saw the same warning words inscribed-"The grave will anticipate her   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     157 choice!"From the moment Father Omehr had thus spoken of the Lady Margaret, the sentence blazed on the tablet of Gil- bert's memory like the writing that made Belshazzar tremble. He required no in- terpreter-the prophecy was plain; he would fain have mystified it - ut there it stood in frightful perspicuity. X It can no longer be concealed that Gil- bert loved the Lady Margaret. He was at the age when the heart is most easily influenced; his own fine constitution and his delicate taste enabled him to appreciate the superior beauty of the fair being who had dressed his wound; his education, in which romance had not been neglected by his father, enjoined the observance of a due homage to personal charms; and his imaginative and impulsive spirit led him rather to encourage than resist his first inclinations. Though struck with the grace of Margaret when he first saw her in the church of the Nativity, and "   158   THE TRUCE OF GOD. still more impressed with her appearance in the cottage of the priest, his admiration might have expired in a brief fit of ten- derness. But the words of Father Omehr had fixed her image in his mind, by awak- ening a dangerous sympathy for one so frail and lovely. Family prejudices had disappeared in his increasing fondness; they served but to irritate without con- trolling his aspirations. He persuaded himself that he might worship in secret, without compromising his father; that he could rest satisfied with the remembrance of what he had seen, without a desire to behold again the object so vividly retained. Gilbert was not logician enough for these sophistries. "The grave will anticipate her choice!" The dread words kept sounding in his ears. Why was it he drooped and forgot his pastimes, when he could preserve her image, whlether she died or not? Why was it he lamented -his love as hopeless,   / THE TRUCE OF GOD.     159 when he had in possession all that he fancied he sighed for? wThy was it that his eye brightened, and his cheek flushed with pleasure, when he brought himself to believe that the missionary might be mistaken? All these questions were soon answered- by a desire to see the Lady Margaret once more. He longed to discover whether she had grown thinner or paler-whether she was withering away-and whether she still retained the form and features that were now a part of his sight. As he thus meditated day by day, his affection ob- tained alt the strength of which so sudden a transport is capable. Before he knew the extent of his infatuation, he was re- volving the feasibility of revealing his at- tachment. At last he had determined to embrace the first chance of declaring a love now past concealment. At the same time that the Lady Marga- ret was speeding to Stramen Castle, Gilbert 4'   160   THE TRUCE OF GOD. was standing on the top of a steep hill that rose abruptly some distance to the north of that on which the towers of his fathers were built. He found a pleasure in sur- veying the majestic masses of thick dark clouds, that slowly overspread the west and swallowed up the sun. There seemed to be a mysterious sympathy between him and the angry elements; or perhaps he felt flattered to find the deep thunder and arrowy lightning less potent than the artil- lery within his bosom. He laughed at the coming storm, while the eagle flew by with a shriek, and the cattle sought any casual shelter. But, as he was not ambitious of becoming thoroughly wet, he sprang down the hill when the big drops began to fall, and entered a neat cottage situated in the opening of a rich valley, that swept from the hills toward the lake. "What! alone, Humbert?" said the youth. "Your wife and children are not out in this storm, I hope?"   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    161 "They are praying in the next room," replied the man, sinking his voice. Gilbert turned to the window; but the rain was now pouring down in torrents, and he could discern nothing but the light- ning. Humbert was a favorite with the Lord of Hers. He played upon the harp i  with more than common skill, and could personate the regular minnesinger to per- fection. His stock of ballads was inex- haustible, and some of his original songs might well compare with his borrowed lore. Besides this, he was a daring huntsinan, an expert falconer, and a trusty follower. "Humbert!" exclaimed the youth, in a searching whisper, "would you like to play the minnesinger in this storm?" The retainer smiled and replied, "Yes, if I were a bull, and could bellow the lay." But Gilbert answered, without relaxing a muscle, "You will not be called upon to play until you can be heard." "*     L   162   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Then we might as well wait until to- morrow," said the other, with great sang- froid, looking over Gilbert's shoulder at the rain. "uBut understand me!" muttered the youth, rather sternly; "I am in earnest! Will your harp weather this storm?" "Yes," returned Humbert, still play- fully, " if we loosen its nerves: I have a water-proof case for it. But I haveo no water-proof case for myself; and being compelled to brace my nerves for the en- counter, they will be apt to snap." "You incorrigible trifler, can you dis- guise yourself as well now, as when you palmed yourself upon us all for the min- strel Guigo?  "Certainly." "And can you array me as your harp- bearer, and alter this face and form of mine?" "With much more ease than I can play the minstrel in this storm.'   THE TRUCE OF GOD.   163 "Then do it at once," said Gilbert. "My lord!" "CYes!"   ' f' AWhere?"  "}Here!" "Wthen!"  "Now!" -Humbert eyed the young noble with a comic surprise. "Had we not better wait until the rain abates?" "It is abating now," replied Gilbert. It was true: the first frenzy of the storm was over, and there was coming a pause in its wild career. "There!" resumed the youth; " you can ride to the castle and bring two good horses before it begins again. Quick! I shall wait here."' "You had better wait up stairs, out of sight," suggested Humbert. "You are right." "This way, my lord; " and, followed by  ,q   164   THE TRUCE OF GOD. his retainer, the young noble ascended to a room that might have been denominated Humbert's studio. The latter, descending at once, called his wife, exchanged a few words with her, the import of which was to keep herself invisible, and, accustomed to a ready obedience, he leaped upon his horse and spurred for the castle. The dis- tance was not greater than half a league, yet to Gilbert he was absent an age. It was quite dark before Humbert had completed the disguises to his satisfaction. His own was a masterpiece in it1 way. He assumed a grace and a lightness hat might well become a minstrel of no ordinary de- gree. The character of his face was com- pletely changed, and was reduced, by means of long flaxen curls and other artificial ad- ditions, from frank manliness to almost feminine delicacy. The Lord of Hers him- self could not have recognized his son in the drooping, swarthy, gypsy-looking fig- ure that stood beside Humbert. Gilbert's   THE TRUCOE OF GOD.    165 head was enveloped in something like a cowl, and his whole figure was muffled up in a coarse brown cloak. Thus attired, he was to play the part of a Bohemian harp- hbearer. The moment the finishing touches were put, the impatient youth hurried the more cautious yeoman to the saddle. The rain had ceased to fall, but the sky was still overcast and threatening. Though the moon was more than half full, they had barely light enough to justify the rapid pace at which the noble led the way. It. was a little out of character for the minne- singer to carry his own instrument when a harp-bearer was so near at hand. But Humbert knew how to sling the harp across his back, and Gilbert, a mere novice in the art, would have found the burden exces- sively'embarrassing. Gilbert pressed for- ward without opening his lips or looking behind, until they had entered the lord- ship of Stramen. Humbert, respecting the   166   THE TRUCE OF GOD. humors of his superior, followed just as silently. But he began to grow anxious as they kept advancing, and he could not repress an exclamation of surprise as Gil- bert halted on the brink of the ravine we have described before, within a league of the castle. They led their horses down into the gully and tied them to two stout trees. "Give me the harp!" exclaimed the youth, commanding rather than entreat- ing. Humbert surrendered the instru- ment without a word, and they emerged from the ravine. They walked on, side by side, still in silence; for Gilbert's mind was wrought up to the highest pitch, and held too thrilling communion with itself to notice his companion, except at brief in- tervals. But when they came within full view of the dim turrets of Stramen Castle, j d the youth kept steadily advancing to- ward them, Humbert stopped short, and perceiving that Gilbert still advanced, he   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    167 made bold to stay the rash stripling by touching his arm. l Gilbert started and stood still; then said, with cold contempt: "Do you flinch?" "From  wHat?" inquired the other, calmly. "From that mass of stone." "What have we to do with that?" "Enter it before an hour." "And die before an hour," replied Hum- bert. "Or live," said Gilbert, rather to him- self than to his attendant, and resuming his rapid advance. Humbert stood awhile, rooted to the ground, in mute amazement at his lord's inexplicable behavior. But every mo- ment was precious. He sprang forward, and again seizing Gilbert's arm, he threw himself on his knees. "My dear lord!" he exclaimed, "I cqn- jure you in the name of your father to de- sist from this madness, and to return! You   168   THE TRUCE OF GOD. are rushing upon certain destruction! You are flinging away your life! Remember it is Monday! The arm of our blessed mother, the Church, cannot protect you to- day! My wife and my children will be left without a father, and the lordship of Hers without an heir!"Here the honest yeoman burst into tears, but the youth's determination was taken. He disengaged himself from his follower's grasp, and said, resolutely, but kindly: "Return!" "And leave you to perish alone?" cried Humbert, springing to his feet. No, no! I am no craven! And why should I re- turn? To be reproached with having seduced my lord into danger, and then basely deserted him? If you advance, I go with you, though I cannot guess your object, or justify your seeming madness. But I implore you to remember your duty as a son and as a Christian, and not to take a step that will make your enemies   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     169 exult and your fi-iends tear their hair in sorrow!           \ For a moment the noble stood irreso- lute; but the next instant he seized Hum- bert's hand with a vice-like grip, and whis- pered in his ear, "I must see the Lady Margaret!" Without waiting for a reply, Gilbert strode forward. Before thile drawlSridge was gained, Humnbert had recovered him- self, and was prepared to put forth all his daring and skill to extricate themselves from the consequences of this perilous ad- venture.   + "Ho! warder!" he cried, in a confident tone, " a minnesinger-Ailred of Zurich --and his harp-bearer, wet and fasting. Shelter in the name of God!" Down came the drawhridge, and the portcullis rose and fell, leaving them on the other side of the moat, surrounded by the men of Stramen.   They were con- ducted with much respect to a comfortable   170   THE TRUCE OF GOD. room in the castle, and the arrival an- nounced to the Lord Sandrit de Stramen. The baron, who had heard of Ailred's rising fame, was delighted with the intel- ligence, and invited the minstrel to his principal hall. Humbert uncased his harp, and having tuned it, delivered it to Gil- bert. Then, with scrupulous care, having re-examined his costume, he ascended a flight of stairs, escorted by a serf, and- ordered Gilbert to follow. They were ush- ered into a spacious room, hung with armor and broidered tapestry. Around a blazing fire were seated the baron and Father Omehr, and some paces behind tlem stood several attendants. Sir Sandrit rose and sa- luted the minstrel with much courtesy, and bade him warm himself at the genial hearth. Humbert received the baron's congratula- tions without embarrassment, and pledged his health in a brimming bowl. While the minnesinger and the noble were ex- changing compliments, Gilbert kept a re-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    171 spectful distance, supporting the harp. He feared to look at the missionary, who sat, evidently little concerned about Ailred of Zurich, wrapped in meditation. His heart had grown cold when, on entering the room, as he glanced around, he missed the Lady Margaret. Was she sick? Was the prophecy to be so swiftly consummated? He maintained his position unnoticed, save by the domestic who offered him wine, until the diligent seneschal had spread a long table, which soon presented a most tempting appearance. Venison, boar's flesh, fish, fowl, pastries of various kinds, and generous bowls of wine, proclaimed the hospitality of the proud baron. Father Omehr blessed the board, but declined par- ticipating in the repast. Sir Sandrit forced the troubadour to sit at his side, while Gil- bert occupied a seat at the lower end of the table, among the dependants of the house; for the arrival of a minstrel was one of those momentous occasions when   172   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the lord of the fee welcomed his retainers to his own board, and extended equal favor and protection to the highest and the low- est. H-umbert's animation increased as the sumptuous meal progressed, while his na turally brilliant qualities, and a remarka- ble fund of wit and anecdote, so fascinated the baron that he was wholly absorbed in the charming Ailred. Gilbert sat silent and watchful, eating just enough to avoid observation. When the banquet was draw- ing to a close, the Lady Margaret entered the room, and glided to a seat beside the priest. The blood rushed to Gilbert's face with such a burning thrill, that he bent his head to hide his confusion. He trembled in the violence of his smothered emotion. It was some minutes before he dared to look up. Her face was exposed to his gaze, and he could see every feature distinctly. She was still the same - ay, more than the same -she was lovelier than ever. Re- gardless of discovery, he fixed his eyes   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    173 upon the apparition that had haunted him so long, and was only recalled to a sense of his position by a loud call from the baron for tie harp. As he carried the instru- ment to the spot indicated by Ailred, the baron presented the minstrel to/his daugh- ter. Humbert behaved with becoming reverence. He took his station a few feet from the table, between Sir Sandrit and his daughter, and began to prelude with decision and great sweetness. Gilbert stood behind him, with his back to the baron and his face to the Lady Margaret. I Humbert, emboldened by his reception, and perhaps inspirited by the wine, sounded the chords with admirable effect; and when the expectation of the audience was at the highest, he introduced a beautiful ballad, and raising his voice, sang the praises of Rodolph of Suabia. The baron and all his followers were listening intently to the minstrel, as, with a heaving breast and flashing eye, he recited the gldry of Sua- 15*   174   THE TRUCE OF GOD. bia and of her majestic duke. Even Fa- ther Onmehr was carried away by the excited Humbert. But Gilbert's eyes and soul were riveted upon the Lady Margaret. What was the strain to him? he heard it not. The violent hopes and fears that had alternately shaken him, had given way to a silent rapture; the unnatural tension of his nerves was relaxed, and in spite of all his efforts, the tears gleamed in his eyes. When the lay was over, the room resound- ed with loud praises, and the baron threw a chain of gold around the minstrel's neck. At this moment Margaret encountered Gilbert's eyes; she reddened with anger at first, but almost instantaneously became pale as death. Gilbert saw that he was recognized--he bent his head upon his breast, and prepared for the worst. But so completely had Hunmbert engrossed all eyes, that the maiden's agitation was not observed. She had penetrated the youth's disguise, and the discovery stunned her.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    175 She was bewildered, and could not deter- mine what course to pursue. Humbert sounded his harp again, and began a wild romance. Concealing her agitation, she endeavored during the song to collect her thoughts. What embarrassed her most, was to divine whether Gilbert's purpose in his mad visit were hostile or merely a piece of bravado. But she resolved to take no step without mature reflection. She was deliberating whether she could communi- cate her secret to Father Omehr, without so surprising him as to excite remark, when he rose and left the room. The Lady Margaret was detained to hear some verses improvised to herself, which she rewarded with a slight token; she then withdrew, without raising her eyes to Gilbert. After she had disappeared, the baron dismissed the guests and retained the minstrel. Seizing this opportunity, Humbert told Gilbert he might retire until he was called, and the youth passed   176   THE TRUCE OF GOD. out, leaving behind only a few favorite retainers with Sir Sandrit and the minne- singer. As the door closed behind him, Gilbert found himself in a long and dimly lighted corridor. He saw a black figure enter at the other end-it was Father Omiellr. "It rains too hard at present to venture out," said the priest, in passing, and he re- entered the hall to wait till the gust had exhausted itself. Gilbert wandered along the arched gal- lery without any definite aim, yet expect- ing to see the 'Lady Margaret start from some secret niche. Suddenly his cloak was pulled so sharply, that he grasped his sword, which he had been prudent enough to conceal beneath the ample folds of his gown.  As he turned, he saw a female with her finger on her lips, but it was not the Lady Margaret: that shrivelled face and curved back belonged to Linda. The old neif, after thus enjoining silence, made   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     1" a gesture for the youth to follow, and shuffled noiselessly before "him. Gilbert's heart was wellnigh bursting withl anxiety as they strode along. hlen they reached the point where the corridor branched off into many smallerpassages, Linda entered one that opened through a sharp-arched door upon the top of a battlemented tower. The youth felt relieved by the cold, damp wind, that drove through the aperture against his burning cheeks. As they reached a recess near the' tower, Linda stopped and leaned against a buttress with her arms crossed on her breast. At this moment, Gilbert became aware of the presence of a third figure, muffled from head to foot in a mantle of fur; he felt that the Lady Margaret stood before him, but all his gallant resolutions melted away, and he remained mute and motionless, powerless to speak or act. Apparently un- conscious of Gilbert's presence, the lady stepped within the recess and knelt before M   178   THE TRUCE OF GOD. a statue of the Mater Dolorosa; the youth was awed and abashed: he began to con- sider his daring adventure an unwarrant- able intrusion; he meditated kissing the hem of her garment and retiring wlith all his love unspoklen. In the midst of his suspense Margaret arose and confronted him; her manner was formal and dignified without being cold or stern. "Are you Gilbert de Hers?"' she said, in an undertone, but her v6ice was firm and clear. Gilbert bowed, but made no other reply. "AVhat is your motive in coming here??" pursued the maiden, still calmly. The youth was silent, his eyes fixed on the pavement. "Vhy have you come so mysteriously - in such a strange disguise?" But still no answer came. "Are you here," continued his fair in- terrogator, with more emphasis, " on a hos- tile mission? Are you seeking vengeance on our house by stealth? Are you en-   THE TRUOE OF GOD.     179 gaged in the prosecution of some criminal vow to injure us?  Speak! Have you come to draw blood?" "No, no!" muttered Gilbert, finding voice at last; "I bear your house no en-; mity." "Beware!" said the lady. "Remem- ber that for years you have been our pro- fessed and bitter enemy." "I was your enemy. I solemnly declare myself one no longer." "Then what has impelled you to this step? Is it an idle curiosity--a mere piece of bravado?" Gilbert made no reply. "Is the object of your visit fulfilled? If so, fly at once! Your life is in danger -you cannot long escape detection-it is dangerous to tempt my father. Go! you will find none else here to listen to your denial of an inimical intent in this reckless deception." "My   object is but half fulfilled!" ex-   180   THE TRUCE OF GOD. claimed the youth, throwing himself at the Lady Margaret's feet. It would argue a poor knowledge of the quick apprehension of woman, to say that the maiden was entirely unprepared for such a movement; but the suddenness of the demonstration made her start. Gil- bert's embarrassment had disappeared in his fervor. He no longer stammered and stuttered, but with unhesitating eloquence went through that ancient but ever fresh story, found in the mouths of all suitors in all ages. Linda stood with her eyes and mouth distended, looking as though she had been petrified just as she was about to scream. It was rather a poor omen for Gilbert that Margaret should have turned to the old servant, who had advanced a pace, and calmly motioned her back to her corner. The daughter of Stramen listened to Gilbert's passionate professions with the air of one who was hearing the same vows, from the same person, under similar cir-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     181 cumstances, for the second time. She could scarcely have foreseen this; but there is no estimating the power of antici- pation: it is the mother of much presence of mind and unpremeditated wit. After reciting the history of his love from its dawn to its zenith, Gilbert began to conjure here not to slight his affection, and not to permit family prejudices to stand in the-way of their union. "It can never be sufficiently lamented," he said, "that the demon of revenge has so long separated our houses, which ought to be united in the closest ties of friend- ship. It is time for us to learn to forgive. We have been too long aliens from God, and wedded to our evil passions. We must fling aside the scowl of defiance, the angry malediction, the sword and the fire- brand, and, like Christians and neighbors, contract an alliance that may edify as much as our discord has scandalized. I conjure you, in the name of the victims already 16   182   THE TRUCE OF GOD. made by our feud -of the numbers who must perish by its continuance--in the name of the holy Church whose precepts we have disregarded, of the God whose commandments we have violated, not to dismiss me in scorn and anger. Hhave perilled my life, that I might end our en- mity in love." "I am most happy," interposed the Lady Margaret, availing herself of the first pause in his rapid utterance, "I am most happy," she repeated, in a voice of singular sweet- ness, " that our enmity may end in love -" A smile of exultation shot over Gilbert's face, and a sound of joy trembled on his lips. This did not escape the maiden, for she instantly added: "But not in the love you propose!" The light was gone from Gilbert's coun- tenance, and he stared wildly into the lovely and mournful face before him. "Not in the love you propose," she resumed.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    183 Hitherto she had spoken seriously and without agitation, but now her whole man- ner was changed. Her cheek glowed and her eye gleamed: a sudden animation ap- peared in every limb. She took a step forward, and bent over the still kneeling youth, fixing upon him a steady, penetrat- ing gaze, as though she sought to read his inmost soul. "Tell me, Gilbert de Hers," she said, "do you truly desire peace between us?" "As I live," replied Gilbert, "yes!" "Do you desire it for the love of God, and because our enmity displeases him?" "Yes." "Then consecrate yourself to the attain- ment of that peace! Let no selfish motive spur you on! Look to heaven for your recompense, not to me! Aspire to eternal favor, not to mortal love! As for me - my days are numbered here! - but what remains of life, I devote to the same holy end. We will labor together, though   184   THE TRUCE OF GOD. apart, in a noble cause - our prayers shall be the same-our hopes the same-our actions guided by the same resolves! If I should die before our task is done - if my death fail to soften my father's heart - falter not in your enterprise! With the grace of God, I shall be with you still! Fix your heart there!" Her trembling finger was raised to heaven as she spoke, and in the splendor of her pious enthusiasm, she seemed rather the guardian angel of the youth than a daughter of earth. Gilbert remained as one entranced -he did not even hear the sharp scream that burst from Linda, as Bertha, with her hair streaming wildly over her face and neck, darted toward them through the corridor, followed by a dozen men-at-arms. "Fly! fly! my lady!" cried the terrified neif, setting the example. But Margaret remained firm. "Rise!" she said to Gilbert, who still   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    185 knelt as if turned to stone. Alive to her voice, he sprang to his feet. "Back!" cried the Lady Margaret to the leader of the party, who was now within a few feet of her. "Pardon me, my lady," said the man, bowing deeply; "your sire has command- ed us to arrest the harp-bearer." The maiden reflected an instant, and then said: "Offer him no violence take him before my father-I will accompany you." Gilbert had drawn his sword, but at a sign from the Lady Margaret, replaced it in his belt, and suffered himself to be seized by two of the men of Stramen. Margaret led the way along the corridor, followed by Bertha, whose voice could be heard at times mingling with the clank of the heavy feet that waked a hundred echoes along the vaulted passage. Had Gilbert looked behind him as he left the ravine, he would have seen a female figure there 16*   186   THE TRUCE OF GOD. -that figure had dogged him ever since. Bertha was again his evil spirit: with a peculiar cunning, she had followed him unobserved to the interview with the Lady Margaret, and then communicated her sus- picions by gestures and broken sentences to the baron. Scarce knowing whether to credit the confused story of the unfortunate woman, Sir Sandrit had ordered Gilbert's arrest, rather to get rid of Bertha's impor- tunity than as a prudent or necessary meas- ure. When the youth entered the room with Margaret, Bertha, and his armed es- cort, the baron said, without any irritation: "Is this a Bohemian, my daughter? Has he been telling your fortune?" But the Lady Margaret was silent. "Unmuffle that churl," pursued the knight, manifesting some impatience; "let us see what lurks beneath that sordid cowl." "Hold!" cried the youth, arresting the lifted arm of his guard and uncovering his   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     187 head with his own hand. t' There is no  motive for concealment now, sir," he con- tinued, meeting without flinching the kin- dling eye of the baron. "I am Gilbert de Hers!" At this bold declaration, Sir Sandrit started up, almost livid with anger, while the corded veins swelled in his menacing brow; Father Omehr clasped his hands, despondingly at first, and then, raising 1 them as if in prayer, kept his eye fixed on the baron; the Lady Margaret bent her head in deep affliction, and Humbert in- voluntarily struck his harp. The single note sounded like a knell: a death-like silence ensued. Already four stalwart sol- diers had secured Gilbert's arms, and with determined looks they waited but a signal from their chief: still the infuriated knight scowled at Gilbert, and still the latter firm- ly bore the storm. "To prison with him!" at length ex- claimed the baron. "Instant death were !   188   THE TRUCE OF GOD. too good for the designing villain who has stolen like a snake into our midst. Away with the deceiver, who would stoop to seek by a most unmanly stratagem the revenge he dared not openly attempt." "The bravest of your name," retorted Gilbert, "has not yet dared to set foot within my father's halls?," "Because we murder not by stealth!" shouted Sir Sandrit, stung by the sar- casm. ' I meant no murder in coming here!" "Aha! you find it easy to disguise your designs as well as your person!" "I came to renounce the foe at your daughter's feet, and tell her that I loved her. I have done so - do your worst!" While the youth was speaking, the mad- dened baron snatched a heavy mace from a man who stood by. Already the pon- derous mass quivered in his powerful grasp, when his daughter, with a piercing shriek, threw herself upon his arm. After a vain   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    189 effort to free himself, the ready knight seized the weapon with his left hand, and with wonderful adroitness and strength prepared for the blow. But the baron's arm was again arrested. Between the chieftain and the motionless object of his wrath stood Father Omehr.  The mace must crush that majestic forehead, that be- nevolent eye, must steep those venerable hairs in blood, before it can reach the un- fortunate Gilbert. Calm, but stern, the missionary stood, superior to the frenzy of the noble. "Forbear! In the name of God I com- mand you -forbear!"  Such was his ex- clamation, as, with one arm outstretched, he opposed his hand to the mace. Tempt me not!" cried the baron, growing pale, and stamping in his rage. "Tempt not your God!" returned the fearless priest. "Stand aside! Beware! You shelter a miscreant!"       \   190   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Beware yourself of the fiend at your heart!" replied the old man, maintaining his perilous position. "Think not to thwart me always," re- sumed Sir Sandrit. "I have too long per- mitted your interference. Again and again have you thrust yourself between me and the objects of my wrath! You have ever sided with my inferiors--protected my serfs, and insulted their master." "I have sided with mercy and with your better nature. You are a demon now- and seek what, if obtained, would make you even loathe yourself, and would, in the pure eye of God -" A shrill blast of a bugle sounded at the castle gate. "The duke! the duke!" exclaimed the Lady Margaret, throwing her arms around her father's neck. The mace was still uplifted, the priest was still before it, Gilbert was still pinion- ed by the men of Stramen, and all was !, i   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    191 silent as the tomb, when Rodolph and Henry entered the room. "Did you listen to that minion, Mar- garet?" said the baron to his daughter, without seeming to notice the presence of the duke. "It is because she gave me no hope," interposed Gilbert, " that I am indifferent to your anger." Rodolph, perceiving the difficulty at a glance, put his arm in his apgry baron's, and led him aside, while Henry advanced to his sister. After a long and vehement discussion, the King of Arles left the knight standing with his arms folded on his breast and his back to the group, and released Gilbert from the close grasp of his captors. "Come with me," he said, in a whisper. "Where?" inquired Gilbert. "To the other side of the drawhridge?" "But-I cannot leave Humbert," said the youth, pointing to the brightening minnesinger.   192   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "He shall go with you- they care not for him." At a beck from the duke, Humbert was at his side. "Follow me," said Ro- dolph. But Gilbert lingered a moment to press Father Omehr's hand to his lips, and then the three passed silently out of the apart ment. They soon gained the terrace, where, to his surprise, Gilbert found his own horses that had been tied in the ra- vine. Bertha had brought them there, The two adventurers were conducted bi the duke beyond the castle bounds. The clouds had passed away, and the moon and stars shone brightly out. "Away now'!" cried the hero of Ho henburg. Bidding the noble duke an affectionat farewell, Gilbert and his follower sprang to the saddle and galloped off. But th4 adventures of the night were not yet over Hardly had they passed the ravine, befor   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    193 Humbert's quick ear detected the tramp of a horse behind them. "Faster!" said Gilbert, putting spurs to the somewhat jaded animal he rode. Faster they went, but the sound came nearer and nearer. Again Gilbert urged on his horse, and again the galled creature bounded forward, but the pursuing sound came faster than they. Humbert looked behind, and by the bright moonlight saw a solitary horseman advancing at a furious pace. "It is but one man," said he. "So much the worse!" replied the youth, without checking his speed. "He must overtake us!" continued Humbert; " he gains at every leap!" It was true. The horseman was almost on them. "Fly not so fast, gentlemen!" he cried, as he came up. "I knew it was he," muttered Gilbert, halting. 17      N   194   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "You have given me some trouble to overtake you!" said Henry of Stramen, with a bitter sneer, as he wheeled his swhift horse, which had darted ahead, and con- fronted them. "Had I been well mounted," answered Gilbert, " you should have had your trou- ble in vain!" s"I conjectured as much, from your de- termined flight," returned Henry. Gilbert was stung to the quick, but he constrained himself to reply: "With your permission, sir, we will ride on." "My permission can only be obtainer in one way, and that way should already have been embraced by a Suabian noble. Saying this, the young knight leaped t, the ground, and drew his sword. You will dismount, I trust!" he con tinued, as Gilbert sat steadily in his saddle "No! Let me pass, I entreat you!" sai Gilbert, putting his horse in motion. Bu   THE TRUCE OF GOD,     195 Henry of Stramen, with a sudden spring, caught the reins, and forced the animal well-nigh back upon his haunches. "I knew it!" cried Henry, with a bitter laugh. "You took advantage of my ab- sence to insult my sister, but I returned too soon- for your chivalry. Dismount! The truce of God covers -not to-day. Dis- mount! Add not cowardice to deceit!" This was more than Gilbert could bear. Quick as lightning he stood beside the challenger. It wis but the work of a mo- ment to throw off his coarse cloak and draw his sword. Having chosen his posi- tion, he awaited the assault of his adver- sary. Humbert looked on in breathless in- terest, while the two young nobles fought in the moonlight. For some minutes Gil- bert maintained his ground, despite the furious efforts of his assailant. There was a strong c6ntrast between the desperate energy of Henry and the calm courage of Gilbert. But at length the latter began   196   THE TRUCE OF OOD. to recede rapidly down a gentle slope. His antagonist recklessly pursued. The motive of Gilbert's retreat soon became evident. Henry's foot slipped on the long grass, slimy from the recent rain, and he fell at full length upon the ground. Be- fore he could rise, Gilbert had mounted the far fleeter steed of his opponent. "Return, coward! and see if chance will save you again - shouted Henry, as he gained his feet. ," Your sister has saved you once and she shall save you again!" answered Gil. bert; and, without regarding the denanci ations of the knight of Stramen, he calle to Humbert, and resuming the road t, Hers, was soon out of hearing of Henry threats.

There could be no neu- trality, since not to serve the king was. to serve his antagonist.  Throughout the empire the stern challenge was ringing - "Are you for the Pope or for the king?" The gay and reckless champions of the court, the knights of the house of Fran- conia, and many a bold 'adventurer, crowd- ed around the royal banner.     Many a haughty prelate, too, seduced by avarice E 17            197   198   THE TRUCE OF GOD. or ambition, urged on the monarch in his mad career. But the enterprise of Rodolph and the Lord of Hers had been most happily timed, and the chivalry of Suabia were prepared to follow their martial duke at a moment's warning. That warning followed shortly after the date of the last chapter. Gilbert had gained his chamber as the morn was breaking, and had hardly time to review the exciting events of the night, before an attendant announced hi} father's arrival. The Lord of Hers had reached Zurich on his return, just as the tidings from Rome had been received; and without pausing, an instant, he hurried across the lake to convey the intelligence to the King of Aries. The baron was himself too much excited with the momentous results at last developed, and the still more momentous sequel already shadowed forth in the un- certain future, to remark the nervous and somewhat jaded appearance of his son.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     199 His first words, after hastily embracing Gilbert, were: "Where is the duke?" "At Stramen Castle," replied the youth. "When did he arrive?" "Last night," answered Gilbert, with- out reflecting that he was, as effectually as possible, giving his father a clue to his hare-brained expedition with Humbert. It was well for him that the baron was too well satisfied with the information to in- quire how it had been obtained; for, inca- pable of deceiving his parent, he would have been compelled, very reluctantly, to submit a brief account of his connection with Ailred of Zurich, the minnesinger. A chilly anticipation of the question struck him, just as the words escaped his lips, and his cheek tingled as the blood came creeping against it. But, to his great re- lief, his father, without noticing his confu- sion, turned to a soldier who stood behind him, and thus addressed him:   200   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Mount your best horse and ride for life and limb to Stramen Castle! Here!" con- tinued the baron, taking a fold of parch- ment from his breast, as the man, prompt to obey without question or hesitation, bowed and was going; " this for his high- ness, the King of Aries. Guard it with your life from the enemies of the duke, and if you meet the serfs of Stramen, pro- claim your errand. Away! spare neither spur nor rein! '? cried the knight, as the man dashed fearlessly down the hill. Rodolph of Suabia was scarcely less anx- ious to see the Lord of Hers, than the latter had been to acquaint the duke with Greg- ory's rigorous measures. He felt assured that the infamous conventicle at Worms must have been already met by th. Pope, and he thirsted for news from Rome. He knew that the, Lord of Hers would be first in possession of the facts, from his position along the Rhine; and anxious not to lose a moment in executing his plans, which   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    201 were to be regulated by the action of the holy see, he could scarcely be prevailed upon to defer till daylight his return to Zurich by the Castle of Hers. The baron's envoy had not accomplish- ed half the distance between the rival cas- tles, before he met the duke, unattended, as was his wont, bearing rapidly down upon him. He was' no stranger to the lordly bearing of the duke, for he had watched him in battle, when the strife was warmest and the fight most dubious. The moment he recognized him, he sprang from his horse, and uncovering his head and kneeling down, presented the parch- ment as Rodolph advanced. Without dis- mounting, the duke received the missive, and eagerly unrolling it, began to read. The instrument contained a narrative of the proceedings of the council and a tran- script of the sentence of excommunication. The noble's eagle eye flashed as it scanned the page, and his brod bosom heaved. He   202   THE TRUCE OF GOD. struck his breast in his excitement, and brandishing the parchment in the air, ex- claimed aloud, in a deep, tremulous voice: "Well done, thou noble pontiff! Now, my brother Henry, the time has come, and heaven be the judge between us!" With these meaning words Rodolph gal- loped on, unmindful of the soldier behind him. Yet it would seem he had not en- tirely forgotten the messenger, for when alighting at the Castle of Hers, he threw the man a largess such as had never fallen to his lot before. The duke could not but smile when he saw Gilbert, and taking him aside, he whispered in his ear: "You will soon have an opportunity to display upon the battle-field the gallantry of the Bohemian harp-bearer, and to couch a lance for Sua- bia and the Lady Margaret!" "But how can I thank you for - " "Thank that generous priest and that noble girl!" said Rodolph, interrupting   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    203 the youth; "I ran no risk in interposing: the Baron of Stramen was but cancelling an old debt; I intercepted a battle-axe that was descending upon him at Hohen- burg, and I asked mercy for you, in re- quital." After a long interview, the duke and Albert of Hers resolved to assemble the chiefs of the ducal party at Ulm, and to fix the 15th of October for a general meeting, at Tribur, of all who would take up arms against the king. While the Lord of Hers was engaged in persuading the Duke of Bohemia and the bishops of Wurtzburg and Worms to re- pair to Ulm without delay, Gilbert was polishing his armor and exercising his barb. The stirring spirit of the times, the approaching honors of knighthood, with a golden chance of winning his spurs, as- sisted in diverting his mind from a mel- ancholy contemplation of the hopelessness of his love. But even when brandish- (   204   THE TRUCE OF GOD. ing his stout lance, or wheeling his good war-horse, he would hear those wither- ing- words :The grave will anticipate her choie!" followed by the fatal echo which came from her own lips, in solemn con- firmation of the prophecy; "My days are numbered her e!"Nor could the dazzling dreams of young ambition shut out the still more delicious sight of the Lady Mar- garet, now knedling before the Mater Dol- orosa, now appealing to him with the pure emotion and wondrous beauty of an angel, and now clinging to her father between him and the battle-axe. While the stern Sandrit de Stramen was preparing his vassals for the impend- ing strife, and literally converting the scythe into the sword-while he spared no expense or trouble in supplying his men with arms and hlorses, all gayly dec- orated to make a gallant show at Tribur - while the sturdy yeomen were leaving their ploughs in the fields to pay their rent   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     205 by the service of shield and sword the Lady Margaret, uninfluenced by the war- like bustle, calmly pursued her medita- tions, her daily visits to the church, and her numberless acts of charity. She had a delicate and difficult duty to perform in soothing the proud mind of her brother, stung to the quick by his unlucky encoun- ter with Gilbert. The young knight of Stramen was panting for an opportunity to retrieve his misfortune and wipe out his fancied disgrace. When in conversation with his sister, to whom he would outpour his passionate impulses, he pledged him- self over and over again to bring the dar- ing stripling to his knee who had dared to insult her in his absence. To his fiery threats, Margaret would offer no direct op- position, for she feared to awaken an easily excited suspicion that she sympathized far too warmly with the culprit. This. suspi- cion would have paralyzed her influence. She contented herself with pointing out 18   206   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the impossibility of settling a domestic quarrel at the present moment, and the imperative duty of considering rather the public weal than the gratification of a private inclination. And at times, when Henry appeared more tractable, and when, moved by her tender affection and earnest discourse, he exhibited a disposition more E closely resembling her own, she would suggest what a nobler and better revenge it would be to seek an opportunity of sav- ing Gilbert's life in the coming struggle. Henry's chivalrous nature was easily at-' tracted by this suggestion, and he deter- nined to prove his superiority over his rival, before attempting his ultimate re- venge. Father Omehr's duties increased as the fifteenth of October approached. The yeo- x men and vassals of Stramen recked little of their bodies, but they cared not to peril their souls. They feared not to expose their breasts to the arrow and lance, and   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    207 to meet the powerful war-horse with'un- flinching spear; but they were solicitous, at the same time, to purify their hearts for the mortal struggle. This wise precau- tion indicates no craven spirit, for he who fears eternity the most, fears death the least. The good missionary beheld with a mournful eye the preparations every- where making for a struggle apparently inevitable. He shared not in the ambition of Rodolph or the ardor of his barons; and he bitterly lamented the dire necessity which compelled blessed peace to disap- pear beneath the withering breath of war. Yet war seemed to be the unavoidable re- sult of the excommunication, and the ac- tion of the Pope was necessary to pre- serve the purity and liberty of the Church. Deeply as he deplored the present crisis, he exclaimed, "Thy will, O God, be done! We have done what seemed to be our dut be the consequences what they may!  The empire vas thus divided into two   208   THE TRUCE OF GOD. great parties. At first the partisans of the king were much more numerous and pow- erful; but their strength was daily dimin- ishing, as conscience began to operate upon some, and fear upon others. The most marked and appalling chastisement was overtaking the fiercest calumniators of the Pope. It happened that, on a cer- tain festival, the Bishop William, in the presence of the king, interrupted the mass by a violent denunciation of the Pope, in which he called him an adulterer and false apostle, and assailed him with bitter rail- lery. Hardly had the ceremonies been concluded before the episcopal slanderer was struck down with a fatal malady. In the midst of the most excruciating tor- ments of mind and body, he turned to the minions of Henry who surrounded him, and cried: "Go, tell the king, that he, and I, and all who have connived at his guilt, are lost for eternity!" The clerks at his bedside conjured him not to rave in   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     209 that manner; but he replied, "And why shall I not reveal what is clear to my soul? Behold the demons clinging to my couch, to possess themselves .of my soul the mo- ment it leaves my body. I entreat you - you, and all the faithful, not to pray for me after my death!" 'With this he died in despair. The same day, the cathedral of Utrecht, in which he had preached, anid the royal pavilion, were suddenly con- sumed'by fire from heaven. Burchard, Bishop of Misne, Eppo of Ceitz, Henry of Spire, and the Duke Gazelon, were suc- cessively the victims of sudden and fatal misfortunes. Whatever may be the im- pression produced at the present day, it is certain that these examples and a great number of others, struck terror into the partisans of the king, and many prelates and priests threw themselves at the feet of the Pope and renounced their errors. Thus, Udo, Archbishop of Treves, repaired all penitent to Rorne, and Herman of Metz 18      0   210   THE TRUCE OF GOD. began to waver in his hitherto steady fidelity to Henry. While these causes were sapping the imperial power, Henry was unexpectedly menaced from another quarter. The two sons of Count Geron, William and Thier- ry, who had for some time secretly cher- ished the hope of regaining the lost free- dom of their country, saw in the present confusion the moment for which they had sighed. They raised the standard of re- volt, and were soon at the head of a band of young and noble chieftains, whose in- trepid bearing and dauntless confidence inspired the nation with the desire and o hope of liberty. The escape of the  Saxon princes from Henry's hands and their arrival in Saxony gave an irresistible impulse to the movement, and the whole circle, animated by the same -spirit, rose haughtily to throw off the heavy yoke, never patiently endured. Rodolph lost not a moment in concen-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    2" trating his forces and in profiting by this new defection. He had already secured the powerful assistance of Berthold of Ca- rinthia and Welf of Bavaria, and could now oppose to the emperor the formidable league of Suabia, Carinthia, Bavaria, and a portion of Lombardy. His policy evi- dently was to conciliate the Saxons, and he deemed their impiety sufficiently chas- tised at Hohenburg. He took care to as- sure them that so far from having any thing to apprehend from his opposition to their enterprise, they might rely upon his assistance and countenance. Henry had long affected a contempt for the anathemas of Gregory and an uncon- cern he was far from feeling; but this formidable coalition burst the shell of his apathy and laid bare his uneasiness. He supplicates his nobles in the disaffected provinces to meet him at Mayence; but his earnest prayers are disregarded. Find- ing his advances indignantly rejected by    212   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the princes of Upper Germany, and seeing that his prelates were rapidly deserting him, he addresses himself to the task of conciliating the Saxons. He employs every artifice to excite Otto of Nordheim against the two sons of Geron - menacing Otto's own sons, whom he held as hostages, in case the father refused. But the noble Saxon replied, that he would stand or fall by his country. Though signally foiled in all his schemes, Henry was still at the head of a numerous and veteran army, and he boldly advanced upon the marches of the Misne, to give battle to the sons of Geron. The Saxons did not wait an attack, but sallied forth to meet the monarch. The Mulda, swollen with the recent rains, alone separated the hostile armies, when the king, seized with a sudden panic, ordered a hasty retreat, and fell back upon Worms, where he gave himself up to a lively regret and the gloomiest forebodings. The Saxons exulting in their first suc- s.              ^9   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    213 cess, wished to revive the league with Sua- bia; but first besought the holy see to indicate- which side they should espouse. Gregory's saintly and heroic reply displays the pure motives by which he was ani- mated in excommunicating the king, and which continued to govern his conduct throughout the contest. He cannot recom- mend the anathematized monarch to the embraces of the Saxons- nor, on the other hand, does he entirely commend the self-interested zeal of Rodolph. He wishes to humble the king without exalting his adversaries - to reform the empire with- out a civil war. Had he possessed a parti- cle of the lofty ambition which has some- times been ascribed to him, this was the moment to attach the Saxons to the Sua- bian confederacy, and give a death-blow to the Franconian line. But instead of an animated exhortation to arms, in the name of outraged religion, the magnanimous pontiff writes: "Forget not, I pray you,   214   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the frailty of human nature; and remem- ber the piety of his father and his mother, unequalled in our time." Gregory's re- spect for Henry's parents seems to have inspired him with the charitable hope, which never deserted him, that the king would renounce his vices and return to virtue. It is well to keep this in view; since it is easier, after an inquiry into the struggle between them, to justify the se- verity than the lenity of the holy see. The fifteenth of October had at length arrived, and the eyes of Germany were eagerly directed to Tribur. The left bank of the Rhine was glittering with the chiv- alry of Upper Germany, and the legions of Suabia were encamped along the brist- ling river. Here might be seen the swarthy Bohemian, the stern Thuringian rider, the gay Lombard, and the gigantic Swiss, all mingling together, and apparently indiffer- ent as to where tley might be led. Gilbert de Hers felt a newand ardent d6light in   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    215 gazing upon the long and dazzling array of helmets and spears; he longed for the hour when the whole mass would be in motion against a body beautiful and pow- erful as itself. With far different feelings did Father Omehr behold the formidable battalia. He knew that the pomp of war, if often sung by poets, is oftener chroni- cled in hell. In the beautiful language of the age, he had been taught that "-Peace is the language of heaven, for Christ,who came from heaven, spoke that language, saying, 'Pax vobis!' It is the language of angels, who cried, exulting, 'In terra pax!' It is the language of the apostles, who thus greeted every house they entered: 'Pax huic do- mui!'" Were the hasty and unscrupulous penmen of our generation tot draw their information from the writings of the saints, instead of from martial legends or misera- ble perversions even of these, they would find the spirit of the ages of faith emi- nently pacific, and could be induced so to   216   THE TRUCE OF GOD. represent it. At least, the Church, the teacher and the regenerator of Europe, breathed nothing but "Peace!" Many holy doctors went so far as to condemn hunting, as being calculated to makle men love war. And even the war-cry of the red-crossed knights was: "Mansuetudinem qumrimus et non bella!" The nobles of the empire, the principal prelates who remained faithful to Rome, and the papal legates, Siccard, Patriarch of Aquilea, and Altmann, Bishop of Passan, were assembled within the town in solemn council. Scarcely, however, had their de- liberations begun, before Otto of Nord- leim, at the head of the flower of Saxony,  ppeared among them and declared him- self in their favor. Then former jealousies and wrongs were forgotten, and Otto and Welf and Rodolph, cordially embracing each- otlher, devoted themselves to the exe- cution of whatever enterprise the common cause might require. Seven days were   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     217 consumed by the council in the discussion of the diseases, the wants, and the dangers of the State. In the mean time, Henry apprised of the meeting, had hastened with his army to Oppenheim, and occupied the opposite side of the river. When informed that his cruelty, his blasphemy, his perfidy were strongly exposed and unanimously condemned, and that he was denounced as a violator of law and propriety, false to the dignity of the Church, and faithless to the State, he implored the princes to accept his contrition, and offered to resign all but the insignia -of royalty, with which he could not honorably part, and to give'hostages for his future good behavior. But the coun- cil replied that they knew his sincerity too well to desire another proof of it; and that a perfidy so deeply rooted as his must be incurable. The messages of the mon- arch served only to inflame his opponents still more violently against him; and the, princes, disgusted with his pretended sub- 19   218   THE TRUCE OF GOD. mission, resolved to elect a new king, pass the Rhine, and attack the imperial troops. Henry, driven to despair, concentrated his forces upon a single point, and prepared to give battle, determined to conquer or die. But here, again, the peaceful spirit of the Church interfered to prevent a scene of carnage, by withholding the apostolical suffrage from the nominee to the imperial dignity. As in almost every battle chron- icled by Froissart, the bishops first passed r from army to army, exhorting to peace, and studying to bring the point in dispute to an amicable adjustment, so at this mo- ment the papal legates and the bishops compelled the confederates to give the king to the end of the year to repent, if he complied with certain conditions, the observance of which was required for the peace and safety of Germany. The two most important of these, conditions were, to retire from public life, and to seek, in   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    219 person, at Rome, the raising of the inter- dict. It is impossible not to see in this arrangement the finger of Gregory, solicit- ous to avert bloodshed, and directed by his magnanimous and charitable repug- nance to credit Henry's utter depravity. There were some who regretted this peaceful result, among whom the stern Baron of Stramen was conspicuous for his open denunciation of the treaty: nor eould the polished Lord of Hers conceal his contempt for a compromise, which threw away a present advantage, in con- sideration of the fear-extorted oath of a perjured debauchee. Rodolph himself deeply regretted that the Pope would not consent to crown him king, a consumma- tion he required before acting against his brother, lest he should be branded as a rebel. Even 'Gilbert and Henry of Stra- men were crestfallen in the blight of all their budding hopes. Of all our Suabian friends, Father Omehr was the only one   220   THE TRUCE OF GOD. who rejoiced in this amicable termination of the council, and who devoutly returnted thanks to God for averting a direful war, and proclaiming, in the favorite languge of heaven, "Pax fiat!"      : During two months and a half, Henry -luried himself in solitude at Spire. -Ro- dolph remained watchful and expectant, now at Zurich, and now in Saxony. 'All was calm in the lordships of Hers and Stramen. The Lady Margaret was lament- ing the absence of Father Omehr, who had been summoned to Rome, and whose missionary duties were performed by the pious Herman.  The year of grace was drawing to a close, and the proud barons began to hope that the emperor would permit it to pass without observing the stipulation in the treaty to repair to Rome and ask pardon of the Pope. The new year had begun, and January was half over when the King of Aries was startled with the intelligence   THE' TRUCE OF GOD.    -221 that Henry had purchased from Adelaide, the widow of the Margrave Otho, a free lassage into Italy, and, in spite of snow and ice, had -crossed tfe Alps, and *as ap- proaching the fortress of Canossa, whither Gregory had retired. At first it was ru- mored that the monarch had gone to de- pose the Pope, and the Duke of Suabia secretly exulted in the prospect of instant action. But it was soon ascertained that Henry presented himself in the character of a suppliant, and the result of his appli- cation was awaited in breathless interest. Early in the spring of 1077, toward the close of a cold, bright day, Rodolph was seated in his palace at Zurich, surrounded by Albert of Hers and Gilbert, on one side, and on the other,-by Sandrit and Henry of Stramen. This strange meeting, though unexpected and unwelcome to the hostiLe knights, was designed by Rodolph, who thought that by thus accustoming them to restrain their passions in his presence, and 19       , . .    222   THE TRUCE OF GOD. by distinguishing them with equal confi- dence, and praising both sides in equal measure, he might control, in some degree, the antipathies he could not entirely sub- due. But the barons maintained a stern, unyielding reserve, and Gilbert studiously avoided the disdainful gaze of Henry of Stramen. The lamps were scarcely lighted when a messenger from Rome was an- nounced, and the next moment Father Omehr entered the room. The nobles rose, and, greeting the ven- erable missionary respectfully and affec- tionately, conducted him to a seat, and gathered about him, When the attend- ants had been dismissed, and the duke in- vited him to proceed, Father Omehr thus began to describe the interview between the Pope and the king, to which he had been an eye-witness. "I had the happiness to be with his holiness when Henry was conducted by the noisy populace to the walls of Canossa;   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     223 and though we knew not with any cer- tainty whether the king's intentions were inimical or friendly, I could discover in the pontiff's placid face neither hope nor fear. The first prayer presented by the royal suppliant, ascribed ambition and envy to the leaders of the coalition against him." "Tyrant!" interposed the Lord of Hers, "he begins his penitence by a calumny." "Our holy father only replied," con- tinued the priest, -"that the ecclesiastical law did not permit him to judge the ac- ' cused in the absence of his accusers; and invited him, since he confided in his inno- cence, to meet his accusers at Augsburg, and abide by the papal decision." "'Yes!" exclaimed Rodolph, eagerly. "And what said the king?" "That the anniversary of his excom- munication was approaching, and that un- less the interdict were raised, his rights to the crown would be forfeited. Should the Pope receive him to favor at once, he   224  -THE TRUCE OF GOD. promised to submit to whatever his holi- ness might subsequently decree, and an- swer his accusers at Augsburg." "Artful villain!" ejaculated Albert of Hers. "But his holiness remained inflexible," resumed the missionary. "At last, moved by the prayers and tears of those around ,him, he permitted Henry to approach him, to prove his penitence and atone for his contempt of the holy see. The prince de- layed not to avail himself of this grace; and the next morning presented himself at the inner gate of the castle, barefoot and in sackcloth, where he remained, fasting, from daybreak to sunset. This he repeat- ed the second and the third day." "Oh that I had seen him in that saintly guise!" cried the duke, with a short, dis- dainful laugh, while he rubbed his hands, and pressed the floor with his iron heel. 6' Consummate hypocrite!"said the Lord Albert.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     225 "Coward!" muttered the Baron of Stra. men. "I think I can hear his piteous cries now," continued Father Omehr, endeav- oring to excite their compassion, "put forth at intervals: 'Parce, beate Pater, pie, parce mihi, peto, plane! '" But the nobles only expressed extreme disgust. "Finally," proceeded the priest, "the supplications of the saintly countess, Ma- tilda, and of many holy men, induced our good father to raise the anathema on these conditions, proposed to the king, still bare- foot and numbed with cold." A deathke stillness prevailed as the missionary began the enumeration: "That Henry should appear at Augs- burg -that the Pope should be the judge - that he Should submit without resistance to the decision - that he should banish the excommunicated bishops and favorites-- and if one of these conditions were vio- P   226   THE TRUCE OF GOD. lated, that his guilt would be deemed es- tablished, and the princes of the empire at liberty to elect another king." The knights still sat in silence, as if spell-bound, while Father Omehr calmly went on with his narrative: "The monarch swore to observe the compact inviolably. But to give additional solemnity to the oath, the pontiff, while cel- ebrating the mass that followed the recon- ciliation, turned from the altar, and thus addressed the king: ' Do, if it please you, my son, as you have seen me do. The German princes are continually charging you with crimes for which they demand an interdict over you for life, not only from the seals of royalty, but from all commu- nion with the Chlech or society. They demand your immediate condemnation; but you know the uncertainty of human judgments. Do, then, as I advise you, and if you are conscious of innocence, rid the Church of this scandal and yourself of   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     227 these imputations!

"Recoiled from a proof so terrible," an- swered the missionary. The duke still occupied his chair, with his forehead knit, and his arms folded on his breast, but the Lord of Hers sprang to his feet and began to pace the room, and the Baron of Stramen brought his battle- axe heavily against the floor. "Tell me," said Albert of Hiers, ad- dressing Father Omehr, "' did not the Pope revoke his pardon at this evident insin- cerity?" ( No," was the reply. "Then, may God forgive me," returned the excited knight, "but the mercy of his holiness sounds like human folly!"   228   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "It is wealkness- cowardice!" mult- tered the Baron of Stramen. The missionary smiled at cowardice in connection with the name of Gregory VI A bright smile now began to break over Rodolph's face, and he said, turning to his friends: "My gallant knights, this is but an ex- pedient of the king's to gain time; he will never confront us at Augsburg. We must prepare for a struggle more desperate than ever, and, before. another day, I must set out for Saxony." The prophecy of the King of Aries was soon verified. For five days after leaving Canossa, HeInry kept his oath; on the sixth he broke it, and, with an armed band, pre- vented the Pope from appearing among the princes at the Diet of Augsburg. Before another week had passed, the lordships of Hers and Stramen seemed almost deserted. Rodolph had passed into Saxony, to assemble an army there, leav-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    229 ing 'Welf, the Duke of Bavaria, and the Lord Albert, to collect the forces of Sua- bia. Rodolph had taken with him the Baron of Stramen, with his son, and Gil- bert de Hers. Father Omehr, who had been secretly charged by the Pope to mod- erate the zeal of the King of Arles, had also followed the duke, committing his flock and the Lady Margaret to the care i of Herman. It was with a heavy heart that Gilbert saw the towers of Stramen fading in the distance, and felt that he was leaving, perhaps forever, a being to whom he was so deeply attached, without a word, a glance, or even a look. He had, how- ever, evinced his solicitude for the Lady Margaret's welfare, by solemnly charging Humbert to watch over her in his absence and protect her with his life. The knights and burghers of Suabia were now assembling at Ulm. Scarce a man -could be seen between the Danube and the Lake of Constance: mothers were 20 "4   230   THE TRUCE OF GOD. working in the fields, with theiT children about them, and here and there some old or infirm vassal was seated at his cabin door. Little did the Lady Margaret dream, as she gazed from her lattice over the beau- tiful country, dipping down into the river, dotted all over with thriving cottages, from which the quiet smoke of peace was curl- ing--little did she think, as she watched the green fields struggling through the melting snow, and fixed her eyes upon the church of the Nativity, how soon those cottages would flame, those fields be red with human gore, and that church be pol- luted by a hireling soldiery. Little did she think, when praying for the safety of her father and brother, that her own par ternal castle would be the first victim of the war.   CH APTER  VII. The wild dog Shall flesh his tooth in every innocent. O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows! HENRY IV. EHUT out from  Augsburg by the treachery of the emperor, Grego- ry VII. retired to Canosa, where he resolved to let the affairs of Germany shape themselves for a time, while he awaited a more favorable moment for ac- tion. Nor was his gigantic mind occupied with Germany alone, and the movements there which menaced his life and the lib- erty and purity of the Church. Dalmatia, Poland, and England claimed his constant attention. With the most powerful mon- arch in Europe plotting his downfall, he contrived to win the love. and obedience of Zwonomir, to force the rebellious Bo- leslaus from his throne, and to purify Eng- 231 %         ,         -  b   232   THE TRUCE OF GOD. land still more from simony and inconti- nency. As Henry's submission to the Pope had disgusted the bold who were ready to as- sist him, and repelled the timid who waited but a second call, so his shameless perjtry and fearless defiance of Gregory at Augs- burg reassembled his professed adherents, and inspired with new courage those who secretly clung to his cause. The mitres of Luinar, Benno, Burchardt of Lausanne, and Eppo of Ceitz again sparkled around him, and Eberard, Berthold, and Ulric of Cosheim displayed their lances to confirm his resolution. In every country and in every age there must exist a large and powerful party prone to pleasure and li- cense, which is easily arrayed against vir- tue, when the indulgence of their criminal passions is threatened. This party is ever formidable, especially when supported by a powerful king, nobly descended, and le- gally invested with the crown. A natural i   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    233 sympathy, too, had been awakened for the emperor, as numbed with cold he besought the pity of the pontiff; and, with proverb- ial fickleness, men, in 'ascribing humility to the, king, imputed arr6gance to the Pope. Owing to these causes, it was not long before Henry found himself stronger than ever. Inflamed with new ardor, he loudly lamented his submission at Canos- sa, and cursing the hours of misery passed there, swore speedy vengeance against the presumptuous son of Bonizo the carpen- ter. Rodolph had no sooner reached Forch- heim, than it was announced that a gen- eral diet would be held there for the dis- cussion of matters of vital importance to the Church and State, with the suggestion that the absence of the king would facili- tate their deliberations. The Count Man- gold de Veringen was despatched to the Pope, inviting thim to sanction the diet by his presence, to aid them by his wisdom 20*   234   THE YRUCE OF GOD. / and intrepidity, and to take the helm of the tempest-tossed vessel of state. He was also commissioned to inform his holiness of their determination to elect a new king. The Pope, in reply, conjured them not to be precipitate, and to wait his arrival be- fore they acted. There was one feature in the proposed diet to which Gregory objected--the at- tempted exclusion of Henry from any par- ticipation in it. This he endeavored to remedy by obtaining a promise from the emperor to attend the meeting in person. It was partly to avoid the appearance of partiality, but principally in the hope of reconciling the angry factions, that the Pope requested the presence of his un- scrupulous antagonist. Henry not only recoiled from his engagement, but, by blocking up all the avenues to Forchleim, compelled the Pope to remain at Carpi- neta, unable either to enter Germany or return to Rome.  \   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    235 Bernard, cardinal deacon, Bernard, Abbe of St. Victor, and the celebrated Guimon1, the papal legates, announced to the con- federates the desire of his holiness that they should wait his arriyal. But the as- sembled nobles dreaded the least delay. ' Already their cause was weakened by in- decision, and a .hostile army was in the field, receiving daily accessions. Though" May had been fixed for the opening of the diet, so great was the impatience of Ro- dolph and his barons, that it was con- cluded in the middle of March. No sooner had the legates delivered their instructions, than deliberations were virtually begun. The chiefs directed all their efforts to in- duce the legates to sanction the election of a king, and confirm their choice. Gui- mond and his companions, faithful to their instructions, replied: "It were far better to await the arrival of his holiness;" but they added, imprudently, " that they did not wish to oppose their advice to the wis..   236   THE TRUCE OF GOD. dom of the princes, who knew much better than they what was most conducive to the interests of the State." Assuming an im- plied permission to act from these words of courtesy, the nobles proceeded at once to cast their votes. A scene of confusion ensued, created by the jarring of private interests. These were finally quelled by the interposition of the papal legates, and the balloting proceeded without interrup- tion. The vote of the bishops alone re- mained to be taken. The Archbishop of Mayence rose, and exercising his prescrip- tive title, gave the first voice for Rodolph of Suabia. Adalbert and the other bishops followed his example. Otto, Welf, Bert. hold ranged themselves on the same side, and amid universal acclamations Rodolph was proclaimed king. Something still remained--the papal confirmation. There were some who were sad and mute amid the general rejoicings, and among them were Father Omehr. In   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    237 vain had he implored Rodolph to postpone the session, at least until the appointed time would arrive: the King of Arles re- garded the delay as suicidal. In vain, too, he conjured the legates to refuse their ap- proval, at least until May, and begged them, with tears in his eyes, not to give the signal for civil war. All the princes and a majority of the bishops conceived that the denial of the apostolic benedic- tion would destroy thehopes of the Church party; they beheld in themselves the champions of the Church, and identified their own welfare with that of the holy see; they believed that Gregory was only restrained by circumstances from grant- ing the prayers of those who had sworn never to desert him; they maintained that although the Pope might not have per- mitted the election, he could not refuse to sanction their choice after it had been made. Moved by these passionate rep- resentations, and, perhaps, expecting- to - .     1   238   THE TRUCE OF GOD. please the sovereign pontiff, the legates yielded, and confirmed the election of Ro- dolph. When Rodolph heard that he had been called to the throne he shut himself up in his room and sent for Father Omehr. Scarce a minute elapsed before the mis- sionary stood at his side. They gazed at each other in silence for some moments. The duke's lips were compressed, and his brow gathered into a deep frown. Min- gled sorrow and hope were portrayed in the missionary's fAce, and his breast heaved with excitement. I am king!" said Rodolph, in a whis- per, still scanning the priest, as though he would read his soul. "Not yet!" was the reply. "Who can prevent it?" "God!" "Most humbly would I submit to his gracious interposition," said the duke, If   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    239 bending his head devoutly; "but can anyx human power prevent it?" " Yourself!" Rodolph buried his face in his hands, and with rapid, nervous gestures paced up and down the small apartment. "Hear me!" he exclaimed, suddenly leading Father Omehr to a chair, and tak- ing a seat beside him. "Hear me!" he re- ated, bending forward until his lips al- most touched his companion's ear, and the veins swelled in his throat and temples: "I have toiled and sighed and prayed for this! Day after day, night after night, for years, this has been the aim of all my actions, ay, even the limit of my aspirations. Once to be king!-oh! ever since I first clutched a lance I panted for it! In love, in sickness, in peace, in war, I never forgot that one surpassing object -the crown!  Hear me on! It is now within my reach-- can touch it-and you ask me to resign it?- "   240   TEE TRUCE OF GOD. The4 duke paused a minute, his eagle eye flashing fire; then, with a vehemence almost appalling, he resumed: 'tYou ask me to resign it- and I would, without a pang- gladly, cheerfully - this very in- stant! Yes - I swear to you - here in presence of my Creator, that I no longer covet the crown I have well-nigh wor- shipped; that, but for Germany and the Church, I would rather place it on Henry's perjured head than wear it on my own!" "Then you will resign it? said the missionary, eagerly. Rodolph slowly shook his head and fixed his eyes upon the floor. "Let no fears for the Church and your country restrain you," pursued the priest; "they both demand your refusal, not your acceptance." Still Rodolph sternly shook his head. "Then as you value honor, defer your decision until the appointed time-our holy father may still be with us-it is   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    241 treacherous to deprive him of the oppor- tunity of interfering, by thus anticipating by a month the day on which we invited him to meet us." "It is too late for interference now," replied the duke, " and of what avail is it to pause on the brink, when all the ave- nues from Carpineta are closed by Henry's minions?  Have confidence, I conjure you," ex- claimed the other, passionately, " in the virtue and wisdom of his holiness. Rest assured that he will find some means to avert bloodshed and yet preserve his see and the empire." ' War is inevitable i  "Obey the Pope and trust in God. Be- ware how you take upon yourself to plunge the nation in war -to tear down the sa- cred barriers of peace -and open the floodgates for a thousand evil passions to deluge Germany with crime and blood!

"I must rather beware," returned :the noble, "how I sacrifice the last hope of my country and the main support of reli- gion by procrastination and criminal esi- tation. If I refuse the crown, I disb-and my party: men will leave us, and say we tremble, and before long we are at the ten- der mercies of the tyrant; for my resigna,- tion, while striking- terror into our ranks, will infuse new courage into his.

"You are mistaken -wofully mistaken, my lord! While a hope of averting an- archy and civil war remains, Gregory will not adopt the surest means of inflicting both.  Trust in God for the kfiture! Do not pursue what to the mole-blind vision   244  S THE TRUCE OF GOD. of humanity seems expedient, when cer- tain bloodshed is the result! Humble yourself before Him who alone can exalt and lay low! Confide in the efficacy of prayer! Think not that God will desert his Church or her champions!" "I do trust In the future," answered the- duke, " but not until I have embraced what reason dictates for the present." "Do you hold your reason more enlight- ened tfian that of his holiness?" "He cannot see what I see. Urge me no more! It is too late to recede. I know well what dangers I incur by accepting the crown - and what disgrace I should earn in refusing it. Did I consult my inclina- tions, I should renounce the glittering or- nament: but I will not have men to point at me covertly and say, 'He faltered!' I will not endanger the noble barons who have devoted themselves to my advance- ment. If I have sinned in alluring them thus far, I will not deepen my guilt by be-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    245 traying them. Though I knew that the crown which I am about to assume were like the gift of Medea, I would still set it on my temple: better pay the pen- alty of ambition by advancing than by timidly retreating, when boldness may remedy, and retreat is certain 'death!" The tread of armed men was heard along the passage, and immediately afterward the Count Mangold entered the'room. "The diet awaits your highness' an- swer," he said, bowing deeply to the duke. "I will follow you," said Rodolph, " and deliver it in person." Saying this, he strode proudly from the room, preceded by the count and his attendants. As the door closed behind them, Father Omehr fell upon his knees. He knelt there with the tears streaming down his pale cheeks and his hands clasped in prayer, until a long loud shout announced Ro- dolph's acceptance. Then the trumpets' merry notes, mingled with the joyful clang 21* 4   246   THE TRUCE OF GOD. of arms, went up to heaven together with the missionary's sighs. Father Omehr appeared scarcely to hear the martial rev- elry, but as the tumult increased, he rose and glided from the room. A mid the congratulations of the bishops, nobles, and people, Rodolph proceeded in great pomp to Mayence, where he was to be crowned and consecrated the following day. It was after nightfall when Rotolph reached the palace prepared for his recep- tion; and seizing the first moment to es- cape from the embraces of his friends, he retired early to his chambers, accompanied only by Gilbert de Hers. Rodolph had always evinced a strong partiality for Gil- bert, which the youth repaid by the liveli- est love and admiration. 1o sooner were they alone, than the duke threw himself dejectedly into a chair, and was soon plunged into a fit of gloomy abstraction. 'Gilbert stood motionless beside him, in- wardly wondering at the silence and de-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    247 spondency of the man, who, a moment before, had been gayly exchanging felici- tations with all who approached him. 1i "Sit down, my son," said the duke. Gilbert mechanically obeyed. "Do I seem happy?" asked Rodolph. "No, my lord; are you unwell?" "Do I seem overwhelmed with joy at my good fortune?" " has anything befallen you, sire?" in- quired the youth. "Yes!" cried the monarch-elect, seiz- ing his wrist, "the gratification of my ambition!" Gilbert started at the trembling tones and excited gesture of his companiin. "Gilbert," continued the duke, regain- ing his composure, "you see me in pos- session of all that I ever craved on earth. I am now legally invested with the impe- rial crown. It was not the peaceable en- joyment of the throne I asked, but per- mission to occupy'it. I am gratified. a   248   THE TRUCE OF GOD. With all my hopes realized --I never was more miserable than at this moment. I am not sad because I feel that my career is drawing to a close --that I shall be'un- successful in the struggle for undisputed power: it is sufficient for me that I die a king. I tremble because I have discov-  ered the impotence of earthly things to gratify the cravings of an immortal soul - because, in finding that I have a capacity of enjoyment not to be appeased by the highest dignities on earth, I begin to com- prehend my immortality. I see what a shadow I have pursued--how madly I have neglected eternal happiness for tem- poral preferment. You, my son, are full of earthly hope, dreaming of the Lady Margaret, of minstrels' praises, and knight- ly fame: do not think me harsh, if I pray God that you may speedily know their emptiness. You can never rise as high in this mundane atmosphere as I am now; but your soul is as immortal as mine, and   THE TEUCE OF GOD. .   24 would sicken over less renown, as I do over this."   - Rodolph paused, and Gilbert, struck dumb with surprise, gazed up into his face. "It is late, my son," he, resumed, " and we must part. Is there anything you would ask before leaving me?" "There is to be a tournament to-mor- row," the youth faltered out. "And you would take part, in spite of my discourse," said the duke, with a smile. Gilbert's reddening cheeks answered for him. , "I must forbid you to couch lance to- morrow," said Rodolph, tenderly; "you shall receive your spurs at my hands when I am king, but let me be the judge of the time. And remember, my son," he added, detaining Gilbert as the latter was about to retire, " remember what you have seen this night. 'When men shall question my motiveand extol or condemn me, you may say that Rodolph of Suabia was in-   250   THE TRUCE OF GOD. spired by ambition to seek the crown; but that when it was within his grasp, he would have turned from it in disgust, had trot conscience and patriotism compelled him to wear it." As Gilbert, deeply moved, kissed his hand and withdrew, jRodolph retired to an oratory into which his apartments opened. He had been there engaged in prayer for more than an hour, when the Archbishop of Mayence appeared, and, after a brief adoration, entered the confessional. There, in the silent hour of midnight, the king knelt before the priest, in obedience to the voice of that God who bequeathed us a Church to administer the sacraments which he appointed for our salvation, and through which we can only attain it. When Ro- . dolph sat again in his chamber, his brow was calmer and his eye softer and brighter. The morning of the 26th of March dawned calm and bright. A warm sun suddenly interrupted a! long-protracted   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     251 spell of cold weather, the snow rapidly disappeared from the fields and streets, and the credulous saw a happy omen in the genial spring day that broke through the icy fetters of winter to greet the coro- nation. A splendid procession moved to the cathedral, and during the celebration of grand high mass, Sigefroy, Archbishop of Mayence, crowned and consecrated Ro- dolph rightful king and defender of the kingdom of the Franks. After the ceremony, the nobles assem- bled to witness the tournament, where the newly crowned monarch presided with a crowd of barons at his side. Gilbert stood at some distance from the royal person, and watched the tilting with all-absorbing in- terest. Henry of Stramen displayed so much address and managed his horse with. so' much skill, that Gilbert could scarce forbear to join in the applause rendered by those around him. So intent was he upon the lists that a citizen by his side   252   THE TRUC\Ji OF GOD.  had, unobserved by hiri, severed the links of a massive gold chain which he wore, around his neck, and had concealed it in his gown. But a page, who had perceived the theft, throttled the culprit and drew the chain from its hiding-place. The man was ordered to prison, and Gilbert had for- gotten the occurrence, when the assembly was disturbed by loud cries and impre-- cations from without. Gilbert quick as thought passed through the doorway and stood in the street. The bourgeois of Mayence were zealous partisans of Henry, and had already scowled upon the honors paid to his rival. The maltreatment of their townsman had kindled the spark of discontent to a flame. They had at- tacked the soldiers of Rodolph, who, as was customary, attended the joust un- armed, and hatl rescued the thief. As Gilbert stood watching the tumult, he was singled out as the object of attack, proba- bly at the direction of the citizen who had   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    253 suffered in the attempt to steal his chain. The situation of the young noble, clad only in a velvet doublet and armed only with a light sword,' was extremely pre- carious. Yet he did not dream of flight, but for a time kept his assailants at bay, slowly falling back upon the arena. A number of soldiers issuing from the pa- vilion gathered around him; but, shorn of their weapons, they could only parry without returning the blows of their ad- versaries, who were well supplied with stones and clubs. Gilbert had not left the lists unobserved by Rodolph, who immediately despatched a page to watch his movements. When informed of his young friend's danger, he arose, and cried in a loud voice: "Gentlemen, we would not have you meddle in this affray: a party of my' men have gone for their arms, and it will speedily be terminated. But the son of Albert of Hers is now overpowered by 22   254   THE TRUCE OF GOD. these boors. Let some one hasten to his rescue!" Three young knights at once dismounted and passed out: the foremost bore in his crest a long, dark plume. The generous soldiers, who had hitherto received upon their defenceless bodies the blows aimed at Gilbert, were almost all beaten down, and in a few minutes more he would have been exposed comparatively unaided to the fury of the populace. His sword was shivered to the hilt, and though he drove back a giant who attempted to close with him, by dashing the guard in his face, he must have fallen beneath a club that swung over his head, had not a tall knlight, completely clad in armor, strid- ing before him, intercepted the blow, and dashed the assailant to the earth. A shower of blows saluted the youth's de- liverer, but he bore them unflinching, and, vigorously plying his two-handed sword, cleared a space around the exhausted Gil-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    255 bert. The two other knights arriving at this moment, the contest became more equal. But the mob were now. displaying - deadlier weapons, and Rodolph reluctantly resolved to command his chivalry to dis- perse the rabble, when his soldiers arrived with their arms. Inflamed by the loss of their comrades, the now formidable troops threw themselves upon the citizens, and pursued them with great slaughter to their homes. When the knights were left with- out an enemy, Gilbert advanced to em- brace his deliverer. But the knight of the black plume stepped back a pace, and raising his visor, disclosed the features of Henry of Stramen, cold, haughty, and showing just the traces of a smile of dis- dain. Gladly at that moment would Gilbert have fallen into his arms .and entreated him to forget the past; but there were too many eyes to witness a repulse. He con- tented himself by saying:   256   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Sir, you have preserved my life, and with the grace of God you shall not re- pent it." Henry made no reply, and they parted. Gilbert was far too generous to regret an incident which laid him under such deep obligations to Henry of Stramen. He re- joiced that it had occurred, for it might rem{ove the mortification produced by their late encounter, and diminish the mortal hatred with which he was regard- ed. He was also well disposed to wel- come any accident that might give him a pretext for conciliating the house of Stramen. Henry perhaps secretly exulted that he had conferred a favor upon Gilbert that would gall his heart, while it poured a balm upon his own. Still he did' not hold the youth in the same utter detesta- tion as before. On the next day, Rodolph, following an ancient custom, began a tour through his dominions.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    257 Germany now presented the spectacle of a country claimed by two kings. To Gregory the party of the old king was heretical and odious- that of the new king pure and orthodox. Though all his sympathies were with the latter, he still openly blamed and deplored the conduct of his legates, and refused to acknowledge Rodolph as king. The Pope well knew what a delicate undertaking it was to de- pose a sovereign whom he had consecrated, and how fraught with danger such a pre- cedent must be. His interest evidently called him to receive Rodolph at once into his arms, and had he done this, the result of the contest would have been very dif- ferent. In the behavior of Griegory we discover, in addition to an insuperable aver- sion to countenance civil war, a disposition to endure 'the last extremity rather than dethrone a legitimate monarch, and per- haps a preference of Henry, for his pa- rents' sake, to his rival. 22^     R   258   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Both kings prepared vigorously for the struggle which could not be long post- poned. Henry's measures were admira- bly calculated to increase his power. He scattered rich benefices' lavishy among the clergy, lured on the soldiers of for- tune with tempting bribes, and granted enviable privileges to the seaboard towns. The citizens of Augsburg, after tasting his bounty, braved the menaces of his antagonist. Hordes of brigands from Bo- hemia were attracted to his camp by bril- llant largesses and the prospect of an easy booty. The German cities, and particu-  larly those along the Rhine, had always, pursaant to the policy of his ancestors, been the objects of his peculiar favor; and the merchants of Worms were re- lieved from all imposts. The population of these cities were soon ranged under the banner of Henry, whose ranks increased so long as gold could buy, and the promise of license and plunder attract.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     259 Rodolph's policy served to diminish in- stead of swelling his numbers. He de- voted himself, at the sacrifice of every- tlhing else, to gain the Pope to acknowl- edge him as king. He appeared the in- flexible chastiser of simony and ecclesi- astical corruption. The very day of his coronation he had obtained the dismissal of a simoniacal deacon. Everywhere he compelled the nominees of Henry to fly, and filled their places with zealous cham- pions of the canonical discipline. At Constance and Zurich he drove the ir- regularly appointed bishops from their sees: he placed Lutold, a zealous cham- pion of the Pope, over the monastery of St. Gall, which had been devoted to his rival. Many, frightened by these severi- ties, deserted his standards, and others re- coiled from the presence of so rigorous an enforcer of spiritual purity. Thus, while the cause of Henry was flourishing under his criminal artifices,   260   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Rodolph was weakened by his honest se- verity. Yet there was this difference be- tween the parties: the minions of Henry were goaded on by individual interests - the partisans of Rodolph by a common resolution to die in defence of a sublime principle; the first were incited by the hope of plunder, the lust of empire, am- bition, avarice, or a lawless appetite for war - the last were animated by a love of liberty, and fought for future security from oppression; the one prepared to preserve unrighteous license and ill-gotten gains the other were inspired by the hope of re- gaining the freedom of which they had been unjustly deprived, and by the resolve to regain their ancestral rights and to pro- tect the outraged Church of God. Albert of Hers with all his energy and address had not succeeded in extracting from Suabia more than two thousand men. With this small force he joined Rodolph, who was then encamped at the little vil-   THE TRU'CE OF GOD.   261 lage of Sommeringen, with scarce three thousand Suabians. Here they learned that Henry, at the head of twelve thou- sand effective troops, was advancing upon Suabia through Ratisbon. Rodolph soon heard of 'the atrocities of his rival, who abandoned the country to fire, sword, and rapine. Old men and women, pale with fear, came crowding into camp with thrill- ing tales of the brutality of the Bohemians and their associates. The war had begun; and Henry was devastating the region bor- dering on the Danube and the Rhine, from Esslingen to Ulm. Though his force did not amount to half that of his opponent, Rodolph, enraged by the crimes he could - not prevent, would Shave gone to meet his competitor, but for the unanimous oppo- sition of his nobles. While the Suabian party were deliberating upon the best course to pursue, Henry, by a forced march, fell unexpectedly upon their rear. Taken by surprise and overpowered by  e          '   262   THE TRUCE OF GOD. numbers, they fled in all directions; and Rodolph, accompanied only by a remnant of his army, escaped with difficulty into Saxony. Suabia was now at the mercy of the -ictor. Tidings of this disastrous defeat had not yet reached the Lady Margaret. The scanty intelligence she could occasionally glean was not such as to brighten the melancholy caused by the absence of her father and brother. Her fears thickened daily, as rumor, for once unable to exag- gerate, divulged the massacres and impie- ties of the old imperialists. Her only re- lief was in the sacraments, administered by the saintly Herman, and in prayer. The wives of the yeomen, not knowing when to expect the enemy, sought shelter in the castle with their parents and chil- dren. There were gathered the innocent, the aged, the young, the beautiful; and the Lady Margaret experienced some re- lief in administering to their wants and   THE TRUCE OF GOD,      263 calming their anxiety. She did not rely much up6n the few faithful soldiers who were left to guard the castle; but though womanly apprehension would often blanch her cheek, and her frame quiver as some recent deed of shame was unfolded, her confidence in God continued unabated. One afternoon, as the Lady Margaret, surrounded by the inmates of the castle, was seated in the hall, Bertha, clad in a black mantle, stole silently into the room, and glancing wildly around, began to tra- verse the apartment with rapid strideS. Her excited manner attracted mUch atten- tion, and many anxious conjectures were made as to the cause of her meaning ges- tures. At length, stopping before the Lady Margaret, who watched her movements with a troubled eye, she sang, almost in a whisper: "The sunbeam was bright on their shields as they came, But dim on their blood-rusted spears; They. gave up the hamlet to pillage and flame, And scoffed at the kneeling one's tears!"   264   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Perhaps the enemy are upon us," said a gray-coated palmer, who for some days had shared the bounty of the Lady Mar- garet.  At these words, a general murmur ran round the group, and then all was still as death. Bertha resumed, in a louder tone: "They come -they come - the groan, the shout Of death and life ring wildly out! The sky is clouding at their cry, As they toss their reeking blades on high; Arm, gallants all! and watch ye well, Or to-morrow's chime will be your knell." As she concluded the rough fragment, she extended her arm to the south, and shaking her finger menacingly, muttered, "They come!" This thrilling announcement called forth more than one cry from the lips of the trembling listeners. To increase the panic, a groom burst into the room, and whisper- ed something into the Lady Margaret's ear that made her start and turn pale as mar-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    265 ble. Awhile she sat motionless and Ep- parently sinking. But it was not long be- fore her- weakness disappeared, and her face assumed a serene, undaunted expres- sion that imparted new hope to those who were sobbing about her. The wailing was hushed as she rose and said, calmly and without faltering: "We shall probabl be attacked in a few hours by an im^r force. Let us pray to God that we may be able to defeat their malice."' In uttering this she had fallen upon her  knees, and the rest of the group, imitat- ing her examiple, knelt beside her. When that solemn and fervent prayer was over, the voice of the gray palmer was again heard, as he cried: "If any man here can still hurl stone, or thrust spear, let him follow me to the walls!" About six, in whom  age had not quenched the fire or strength of youth, 23   266   THE TRUCE OF GOD. and as many beardless youths, sprang up at the call, and accompanied the speaker out of the room. Exclusive of this new force, the de- fenders of the castle were not more than twenty, yet so admirable were its defences that they might hold in check an attack- ingparty of more than a hundred. The warder and his men were grouped to- gether at the main gate, straining their eyes against the horizon, where the smoke of some cottages indicated the presence of the foe, when the palmer advanced and asked permission to assist them. This was readily granted, and the recruits were soon supplied with defensive armor and the usual weapori. The palmer wore his head- piece over his hood; and, with his breast- plate over his gown, which, tucked up with more than John Chandos' prudence, but half revealed the thigh-pieces beneath it, he was equally onspicuous and grotesque. A body of mounted men could now be   THE TRUC E OF GOD.   267 plainly seen rapidly advancing. They no longer stayed to desolate the humble dwell- ings in their path, but swept on against the stately castle which seemed to bid them defiance. The Lady Margaret was now among the soldiers, animating them to resistance. Guided by the palmer, to whom  the command had been tacitly yielded, the men were busily engaged in carrying large stones up to the battlements over the archway.     t "Who are our assailants?" asked the maiden, as with a firm step she, mounted  the wall. The advancing tro9ps rode ups to the raised drawhridge, displaying as they came the picturesque costume and swarthy face of the Bohemian marauder. The Lady Margaret's cheek was now deeply flushed, and the haughty spirit of her race flashed within her eyes and curled her lip in scorn. "They are not a hundred," she said to the palmer, who stood at her side.   268   THE TRUCE 'OF GOD, In reply, the palmer pointed to a body of men-at-arms, then emerging from a clump of trees in which they had been hith'erto concealed. Her color fell at th e sight of this new force -yet only for a moment: the next instant her chleek re- sumed its glow. This column, about a hundred strong, approached slowly and cautiously, as if expecting a sally, until they too had reached the moat. "We call upon you to open your gates!" exclaimed a knight, who rode a little in advance. "To whom?" replied the Lady Mar- garet, in a loud voice. "To your rightful king and master, Henry of Austri a!" "We do not own a monarch," she re- turned, " who has forfeited the crown, and our gates shall be closed against all who come in his name." "You refuse to surrender?" "Yes!"   THE TRUCE --OF GOD.    269 "Prepare then, for we will force a pass- age!" "We are ready, and invite you to begin!" The animation which had hitherto sup- ported the maiden gave way, and, all trembling, she descended the rough steps and returned to the castle. The attack was at once begun. The as- sailahts were not supplied with cross-bows or instruments for casting stones, and the palmer with the soldiers, who readily sub- mitted to his command, could safely watch their operations from the battlements. Some with their battle-axes dashed into the moat and swam across to cut the chain which raised the bridge; but hardly had they reached the shore before they were struck down with stones hurled from the walls. The palmer's object was to hold out until nightfall, and create as much de- lay as was attainable. The sun was already half hidden behind the hills. 238   270   THE TRUCE OF GOD. But the fall of the bridge now be- came inevitable. Their ammunition was exhausted, and three of the assailants, armed with axes, occupied the bridge, x while others were arriving at intervals. "Let us at least gain five minutes," ex- claimed the palmer. "One sortie for the Pope and Rodolph of Suabia!" The bars were withdrawn and the gal-  lant band poured out.      i "Suabia!" shouted the palmer, as he launched a heavy mace at one who was hewing at the chain, and felled him to the earth. With a well-aimed thrust he laid another at his feet, and so well was he seconded that the bridge was soon cleared. This gallant feat was greeted with cries of rage from their opponents on the other bank, many of whom, forgetting their heavy armor in their 'indignation, leaped into the water and sailk,/muttering idle imprecations. For some minutes the defenders held the bridge, but fearful of o    THE TRUCE OF GOD.     271 being- intercepted, they made good their retreat and stood safe within the gate, without the loss of a man. As further resistance was impossible, the% bridge was abandoned to its fate, and was speedily lowered, amid the rejoicings and threats of the besiegers. It was now to- ward twilight, and the strong gate would baffle their efforts till dark. When that was won, the ballium and the inner wall could still be disputed. "There is nothings to be done now," said the palmer to his companions; " and you had better go to the castle and take some refreshment, for we will soon have need of all our strength." As they retired at his suggestion, he climbed to- the -crenelles and looked anx- iously out upon the plain until the men returned; when, resigning the barbican to the warder, he went to receive the thanks of the Lady Margaret,.who expressed her   272   THE TRUCE OF GOD. gratitude for his services by waiting upon him in person. The assailants had cut down a tree which they used as a battering-ram against the gate; but the stern bars were yet unbroken. It was now pitch-dark. A thunderstorm had suddenly gathered, and the report of the distant bolt came upon the ear, ming- ling with the still more appalling clash of the beam against the gate. Brief indeed was the repose of the palmer before he was again at the embrasures. Bold as he was, he trembled as a blinding flash poured a flood of livid light over the plain and castle. It was not the sudden bolt that awed him; but the 'lightning streamed upon a host of armed men, stretching away as far as the eye could reach. They were not half a mile off. Ano- ther flash leaped out, and revealed a forest of spears. "It is the king himself!" mutter- ed the palmer; " we will be surrounded by a host! God assist us, or we are lost! :'    THE -TRUCE OF GOD.   '273 Such where the sounds that trembled on his lips as he abandoned his post. Select- ing the groom who had announced the enemy, he whispered to him: "Do you wish to save your mistress?  "With my life!" said the man. "Then lead me to the postern gate." In their impetuosity, the attacking party had neglected to blockade this avenue, before darkness prevented' them from dis- covering it. The banks of the moat op- posite the gate had been made shelving; so as to afford a means of retreat to the besieged, without giving any advantage to the besieger. When they had gained the postern and drawn back the bolts, the palmer said to his companion: "Now, as you value life and honor, sad- dle the best three horses - one for your- self, one for your lady, the third for me - swim the moat, and wait till I come." The groom promised obedience, and they ?          w          s   274   THE TRUCE OF GOD. separated--the groom to the stable, and the palmer in quest of the Lady Margaret. He found her in the midst of her depend- ants, praying in the oratory. It was a sight to make the heart bleed--that de- fenceless group, With tearful eyes and hands raised trembling to heaven, now starting as the iron gate groaned beneath the heavy blows, now glancing timidly around as the lightning streamed in upon them. Tnle palmer stepped up to the maiden and drew her aside. "You must fly with me!" he said. "Why? Are we not safe?" "Before one may count a hundred, we are surrounded by the whole army of the tyrant!" This sudden and awful disclosure wa6s too much for the frail maiden, already exhausted by watching and excitement. She grasped his wrist, and shuddering as she fixed her eyes on him, staggered for- ward, and would have fallen, had not the   THE TRUTCE OF GOD.    275 palmer caught her now lifeless form, and, raising it in his arms, passed from the room. Through the gallery, down the staircase, along the portico he passed, as swiftly as- though he carried but a child. The wind came damp and cold against his cheek, the rain poured pitilessly upon his head, the arrowy lightning seemed to play around his feet, but manfully he hurried on with his precious charge. The gate was reached; he paused but an instant to hail the groom and take breath, then slid into the moat, and in a short space stood safe upon the other side. Here he staid but to envelop the maiden in his own heavy cloak, which he had snatched up when the rain be- gan. As her consciousness was but imper- fectly restored, the palmer mounted one of the horses and placed her before him. The groom, at his direction, sprang to the sad- dle and led the third animal. When they were a little within the wood, the palmer exclaimed:   276   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Can you find the road to Count Mont- fort's?" The groom replied in the affirmative. "Then take the lead, and strike it at the nearest point." After groping for some minutes, they succeeded in hitting it, and, aided by the lightning, pursued their course as swiftly as the storm and night permitted. The Lady Margaret was-awakened to her situation only to pour forth torrents of tears. In vain the palmer tried to moder- ate her grief- she could scarcely be per- suaded from returning. The rain had now ceased, and as the clouds rolled away, they obtained light enough to continue their flight more rap- idly and securely. "( Look!" cried the groom, as they stood on the top of a lofty hill. The palmer could scarcely repress an inclination to throttle his imprudent friend; for as the Lady Margaret turned her head, she saw   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    2" a column of smoke and flame curling up, as if it warred against the skies. "It is my father's castle!" she said. "Oh, what has become of those we left?" she added, shuddering. "Let us trust in God!" murmured the palmer. Brighlter and brighter grew the flame - higher and higher rose the lurid column. Still the Lady Margaret continued to gaze on the fiery pillar. At last the light sud- denly expanded and burned awhile with intense brilliancy. It was but for a mo- ment. ]Dimmer and dimmer grew the flame, and darkness soon settled over the ashes of Stramen Castle. The palmer now placed the maiden upon the third lwrse, and led the way with his hand uponmher bridle. Two hours more brought them to the fortress of Tubingen, X where the brave Count Montfort, though refusing to join Rodolph, had designed to hold out to the last against his perjured 24   278   THE TRUCE OF GOD. and sacrilegious rival. The palmer de- manded admittance in the name of Albert of Hers, and instantly obtained it. The generous countess received the daughter of Stramen with open arms, and the count swore first to protect and then to avenge her. Nor was the palmer for- gotten. Despite his ridiculous costume, now soiled and torn and stained with blood, he exhibited no embarrassment when ushered into the presence of the noble group. "The Lady Margaret would know her deliverer?" said the countess. The palmer removed his head-piece and threw back his hood. "Do you remember me, my lady?" he asked, with a smile. The maiden looked as one striving to recall a dream. "Do you remember Ailred of Zurich, the minnesinger?"   THE TRU'CE OF GOD.    279 Her cheek turned scarlet as she ex- claimed, "Oh! how much I owe you!" "You owe me nothing, lady," returned Hmbert. "Is my life nothing?  "If you prize that," was the reply, "re- serve your thanks for him who made your safety my duty."   CHAPTER VIII. Hark to the trump and the drum, And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn, And the flap of the banners that flit as they're borne, And the neigh of the steeds, and the multitude's hum, And the clash, and the shout, "' They come, they come!" SIEGE OF CORINTH. l ODOLPH  was received with open arms by the Saxons. Dukes, counts, barons, and gentlemen hastened to Merseburg, where, at a grand festival in his honor, he was solemnly acknowledged king of the Saxons. On every side the Saxons were flying to arms against their old ene- my, and the princes unanimously advised the new monarch to march against his competitor, who had been recently again anathematized by the papal legates. Ro- dolph, burning to retrieve his defeat and to save Suabia from further desolation, hearkened eagerly to suggestions that chimed so well with his own inclinations. 280   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    281 He tarried only to wait the reinforcements of Welf and Berthold, and, hoping to ex- pedite their union with him, marched upon Melrichstadt in Franconia. Henry was no sooner apprised of this intended junction, than he resolved to de- feat it. Instantly evacuating Suabia, he led his powerful army toward Saxony. He had deployed twelve thousand peasants to cut off the two dukes, and advanced with the rest of his force to the banks of the  Strewe. Before reaching the river, he as-  certained that Rodolph was encamped on the opposite side.. It now occurred to his  unprincipled mind, that he might deprive his rival even of the warning which his  open approach would give, by deputing a  flag of truce to solicit a parley. The arti- , flee succeeded. Scarcely had the deputa- tion left the Saxon camp, before Henry be- gan the attack. Unprepared for this treach- erous movement, Rodolph had barely time to form his ranks and address a few words 24*   282   THE TRUCE OF GOD. of encouragement to his troops. He was answered with a shout that attested the eagerness of his soldiers for the fray. Al- ready the clang of arms, the cries of the living, and the groans of the dying, were heard along the line. The army of Ro- dolph was drawn up in two divisions- one commanded by the king, the other by the valiant Otto 'of Nordheim. As the di- vision of Otto was a little in the rear, that of the monarch was for a time exposed alone to the overwhelming numbers of the enemy. But nobly indeed was the brunt of the battle borne. Rodolph waited not the 'onset, but led on his columns to the charge. Then Suabian and Saxon darted forward shoulder to shoulder, and the lords of Hers and Stranmen, side by side, shouted their battle-cries and hurled their followers upon the opposing ranks. Such was the ardor inspired by Rodolph that, at the first shock, two of Henry's columns were broken. But this advantage   THE TRUCE OF GOD.   - 283 did not long avail against' equal courage and superior numbers. Henry was at the ( head of the finest troops in the empire. But the consciousness of the sacredness of their cause made the soldiers of Rodolph invincible. Already Eberard le Barbu, the faithful counsellor of Henry, the Count of Henneberg, Thibalt, and Henry of Lechsge- mund had fallen around' their lord. At this moment some bishops, retiring from' the ranks of Rodolph, communicated a panic to those around them. It was in yain that Rodolph displayed the brilliant valor that had woron him the name of the first knight of the times-that the Lord of Hers put forth his utmost skill, and the / Baron of Stramen displayed his unrivalled strength. Menace and entreaty failed alike, nor could example or reproach recall the fugitives. "Why does not Otto advance!" ex- claimed Rodolph, who, by dint of almost superhuman exertion, had preserved his   284   THE TRUCE OF GOD. front still unbroken. "Unless I am sup- ported within a minute, tht battle is lost." Hardly had the words escaped his lips, before the war-cry of Saxony "St. Peter! St. Peter!" burst from three thousand throats, and the noble Otto and the Count Palatine Frederick could be seen leading on their troops, all fresh and panting for the fight. Borne down by this vigorous assault, the pursuing column fell back in confusion, and were routed with great slaughter. Rodolph, having rallied his men, rushed on to where the imperial standard was waving, and with his own hand cut down the banner of his rival. A cry now arose -"Henry is dead!"Dis- pirited and borne down, the troops of Henry turned and fled in confusion. They were pursued up to the gates of Wurts- burg, where the vanquished monarch found an asylum. The Saxons passed the night on the battle-field, amid hymns of praise and cries of joy.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    285 In the morning, Rodolph, from his in- feriority being unable to pursue his vic- tory, re-entered Merseburg in triumph; and Henry, unwilling to hazard another engagement, fell back upon Ratisbon to levy new troops. Thus ended the battle of Melrichstadt:  all nigh the waters of the Strewe, as they glide carelessly along, were red with the noblest blood in Germany. Some hours after nightfall; when all the requisite precautions against surprise had been taken, Gilbert de Hers, unharmed, but worn out by the fatigues of the day, retired to his father's tent. He was alone, for the Lord of Hers was in council with the king. It was a sultry night in August, and, stripping off his armor, he threw him- self upon a couch, and gazed languidly but steadily at the flickering watch-fires. He had been knighted on the field by the king, and had nobly won his spurs, but his thoughts were evidently not running on   286   THE TRUCE OF GOD. his own prowess or the praises of his monarch. A listless calm had succeeded his late excitement. His meditations were rather rudely interrupted by the entrance of a man who dashed aside the curtains of his tent and pressed the young noble's hland to his lips. "Humbert!" exclaimed the astonished youth, springing to his feet; and em- bracing his trusty follower, he poured forth question upon question with such ra- pidity that Humbert did not even attempt a reply. When Gilbert had composed himself sufficiently to listen, the gallant re- tainer began to relate all that had occurred at the lordship of Stramen. Gilbert list- ened mute and breathless until informed of the Lady Margaret's safe arrival and princely reception at the fortress of Tu- bingen. Then, forgetting his rank in his joy and gratitude, he threw his arms around his companion's neck, and forced into his hands the chain of. gold which   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    287 had nearly proved fatal to him at the tournament. "The morning after our arrival at Tu- bingen - "resumed Humbert. "Yes -go on!" said the youth, who not until then had reflected upon the dan- ger of her position, even at Tubingen, and was eagerly drinking in the words of his companion. "The morning after our arrival we saw Henry's whole army drawn out in the plain. We were summoned to surrender. The whole court replied: 'A Montfort holds no parley with a, perjured king and false knight.' Instantly we were furiously assaulted on all sides. But the defences were complete and completely manned, and they fell back foiled at every point. For three long days we held the barbican against their united efforts. On the morn- ing of the fourth they began to retire, and before sunset we were left without an enemy. When I found that my services   288   THE TRUCE OF GOD. were no longer required, I determined to return to Hers, and then seek you here." "Had the Lady Margaret recovered from her fright and fatigue?" asked the youth. "With the exception of a slight cough, brought on, I suppose, by the rain-." Gilbert's next question related to his paternal estate. "The chapel stands uninjured, " said Humbert. "And the castle?" "The blackened walls alone remain!" "We shall be avenged!" cried the young knight, drawing a deep breath. "How was the chapel preserved?" "Numbers of women and children had fled there for protection, and our good Father Herman, standing in the doorway, told the miscreants they must pass over his body. He would have fallen a victim to his zeal, had not the Duke Godfrey de Bouillon interposed and driven back his soldiers with loud reproaches."   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     289 WNVhere is Herman now?  ' Among his poor flock, who have lost almost all-- endeavoring to procure them iood and shelter, and exhorting them to patience and submission to the will of God." "How fared Stramen Castle?" ( Even worse than your own." "And the church?" continued Gilbert. "Was despoiled and fired." At this instant the curtain of the tent was parted again, and Father Omehr stood before them. lWhen informed of the fate of his church, the missionary calmly raised his eyes to heaven and repeated, in a clear, steady voice, those sublime words: "The Lord has given and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord!" But when apprised of the position of his parishioners, who must inevitably have perished from the oldest to the youngest, the old man bent his head upon his breast, 25      T   290   THE TRUCE OF GOD. and, pressing his hands to his face, wept bitterly. He soon recovered his habitual resignation, and then, turning to Gilbert, said mournfully: "Do you see, my son, that God is be- gining to punish our feud?" Immediately after his victory, Rodolph despatched messengers to the Pope to give him the intelligence, and implore him to recognize the king in the victor. We always approach with veneration and extreme diffidence the character of this mighty man. It is difficult, indeed, to form an adequate idea of his moral gran- deur. The better you study his views, the more you are astonished at his wisdom and foresight; the deeper your scrutiny of his motives, the higher your respect for his sanctity. His was an age of tran- sition. The great question was still unde- cided-Shall liberty or tyranny prevail- barbarism or civilization? This question depended upon the answer to another-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    291 Shall the Church of God be free or become the creature of temporal power? Already William the Conqueror and Henry of Austria were trying to fetter the spouse of Christ -already the gulf was opening that threatened spiritual Rome with de- structior. Then it was. that Gregory Vil. saved the Church as Curtius saved the city; but while the pagan has been raised to the skies, the Christian has been in- sulted and belied. Never can we suf- ficiently contemplate the spectacle of one man contending against the world! Not a chieftain, at the head of an army, subdu- ing kingdom after kingdom; but a priest, without a carnal weapon, resisting a con- tinent combined at once to crush him, and finally vanquishing by his death. Unin- spired by ambition, assailed by every earthly motive, God alone could have directed, and God only could have up- held him. The Emperor of Austria had sworn to depose him, the Italians prom-   292   THE TRUCE OF GOD. ised to assist his antagonist. 5With scarce a footing in Germany or Italy, cooped up on a barren peak, he wrestled with the haughty conqueror of England, humbled the pride of Nicephorus Botoniates who had usurped from Michael Paripinasses the empire of the East, and deposed Gui- bert the guilty Bishop of Ravenna. Yet amid these cares, such as human shoulders seldom knew before or since, he forgot not the objects to which he had dedicated his life - the punishment of simony and the preservation of ecclesiastical purity. It was in the attainment of these, that he arrayed kingdoms against him and died in exile at Salerno. Harassed and chained down as he was, the councils of Anse, Cler- mont, Dijon, Autun, Poictiers, and Lyons were thundering against sinmony and in- continency. It would be presumptuous to offer a word in defence of the conduct of such a man, had not his actions been so griev-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     293 ously misstated, and his aims so ungener- ously misinterpreted. It were as well to point out the sun when the eye is dazzled by its brightness. Gregory received Rodolph's envoys with * every mark of affection, but dismissed them, saying he could not comply with their request. The pontiff's object was to keep royalty within its legitimate sphere, not to depose a particular king; and he wished to accomplish this with as little bloodshed as possible.  He saw clearly enough that to declare for Rodolph would be to proclaim war to the knife. lIe also hoped that Henry would have recourse to his mediation after his defeat. He was again disappointed. -lis very friends now began to desert him, upbraiding him with ingratitude and coldness.  The Saxons addressed him several epistles in which they threatened to abandon him. But less moved by their threats than their entrea- ties, the pontiff accused them of weakness 256*    294   THE TRUCE OP GOD. and insolence. There was another reason sufficient to deter him from confirming the nomination of Rodolph, had none other opposed it. All Italy, with few exceptions, espoused the cause of Henry, and waited only the pontifical coronation of his rival, to rise in open rebellion. When the his- tory of the times is carefully studied, it will be confessed that the Pope's refusal to accede to Rodolph's request was dic- tated by the greatest wisdom, enlightened and purified by the greatest virtue and for- bearance. Still hoping to arrest the purple tide of civil war, Gregory despatched legate after legate to Henry, charging them to omit no lawful means to incline the monarch to peace, and induce him to abide by the de- cision of a diet which should be convened to judge between him and his rival. This was the pacific adjustment to which the pontiff looked. But Henry iremained deaf to all these remonstrances, constantly de- vI   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     295 cldaring that the sword alone must decide. He was again at the head of a powerful army, and burned to retrieve the lustre of his arms. Rodolph, perceiving that an- other battle was inevitable, prepared for it without delay. Each king was now in quest of the other. They met near Fladenheim in Thurin- gia. As at Melrichstadt, the allied forces of Suabia and Saxony were drawn up in two divisions under Rodolph and Otto. The former occupied a steep hill on the bank of a deep stream, which separated the combatants.  Otto with his Saxons were stationed in the van, and were to sus- tain the attack, while the division of Ro- dolph was to act as a reserve. It was a bitter cold day in January, and a thick mist had canopied the river. Tnder cover of this, Henry, by a retrograde movement, gained the rear of his adversary. Rodolph, i unconscious of this, was. anxiously listen- ing for the din of battle as the fog par- Z*   296   THE TRUCE OF GOD. tially obscured his view. Gilbert had never seen the new king's noble brow' so calm and unclouded -he had never seen his eye flash so proudly and joyously, or the same sweet, buoyant smile upon his lips. But as the hostile army filed out into the plain, and Rodolph found that the en- emy he had expected in front was in his rear, a deep frown for a moment dispelled his smiles. It was only for a moment. He saw that Henry was now between him and Otto. "Ride to my noble Otto," he said to Gilbert, who was at his side, "and bid him charge at once." Before Rodolph had altered his array, Gilbert brought back the Saxon's answer: "Otto of Nordheim declines to abandon the advantages of his position, and says he will not fail you, should you require his assistance."') l"It is well," said the king, frowniang glightly; "he will not fail us."  T1 en   THEE TRUCE OF, GOD.   297 turning to Albert of Hers, he said, in a whisper: "Otto wishes the glory of decid- ing the day, as at. Melrichstadt. Let us try that he may obtain the laurel of victory instead of the odium of defeat. Gentle- men!" he said, in a loud voice, exchanging cheerful smiles with the Suabian nobles around him, "you have now an oppor- tunity of meeting face to face the deso- } laters of your country. Soldiers!" he said, mingling among his troops, " there are the Bohemians who butchered your wives and families!  As the whole body clamored for the signal to begin, Rodolph gave the word, and the chivalry and yeomanry of Suabia swept apidly down the hill. They were met at the base by the whole army of Henry. Still, nothing daunted, Rodolph displayed his impetuous valor, the lords of Hers and Stramen rushed on the de- stroyers of their castles, and Gilbert and Henry fought side by side, each trying to outstrip the other. At this moment, as   298   THE TRUOE OF GOD. Rodolph was tugging at his lance to draw it from the body of a knight he had pierced, it was seized by Vratislaus, Duke of Bohe- mia. As Vratislaus put forth all his strength to disarm his antagonist, Rodolph suddenly yielded up the weapon, and as the duke stag- gered back, sprang upon him with his sword. Timely succor alone saved the Bohemiano "He will be rewarded for capturing my lance," said Rodolph, calmly. "Had not his friends been so fleet, he might have had his recompense in another world." But the Suabians, opposed to three times their number, were beginning to retreat, when Otto of Nordheim, true to'his word, emerged from the mist and fell upon the enemy's flank. "Well done, thou Saxon eagle!" ex- claimed Rodolph, eagerly, seeing the dis- comfited foe staggering before this unex- pected and vigorous attack. "Henry of Stramen, ride to the duke, and tell him he has won the day."   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    299 Rodolph, surrounded by some of his barons, among wlhom were the lords of Hers and Stramen and Gilbert, was posted upon a little knoll, watching the progress of the fight, when Henry returned with Otto's acknowledgments to the king. "Sire!" said Albert of Hers, riding up to the monarch, " your cunning rival there has profited by this mist, and I think we may now turn it to our account." "How?".asked the king. ' The enemy has left his camp in our rear - we may cross the river unperceived and surprise ft. Give me five hundred men, and I will not leave him as much as would satisfy a peasant." Rodolph instantly acceded to the request, and commanded the Baron of Stramen to assist in the enterprise. Though some- what loath to unite in any undertaking with his sworn enemy, Sir Sandrit had learned to subdue his personal prejudices ' for the welfare of Germany. And perhaps   300   THE TRUCE OF GOD. his desire to avenge his recent wrongs overpowered his aversion to the author of older injuries. He readily assented, and) now, united for once, the emulous clans Og Hers and Stramen moved rapidly across the ice on their chivalrous mission. By a well-executed movement they came unper- ceived upon the guard. No quarter was given there; scarce a hostile soldier es- caped. Sir Albert bid his men spare not the cowards whose swords were red/with the blood of babes and mothers. r San- drit, at the top' of his voi, shouted, "Remember the castle!"  Henry and Gil- bert unrelentingly pursued the terror- stricken fugitives. When they returned to the captured camp, every article of lux- ury was gone. The vessels of gold and silver, which the Patriarch of Aquilea and many of the other nobles had brought to grace the revels of their king, were now in the hands of their rough victors, who bran- dished the precious goblets in the air, cry-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     301 ing, Death to the spoilers of Suabia!" The purple curtains, torn into shreds, were trailed in the clotted gore and dust. Be- fore many m inutes the pillage was as com- plete as the surprise. When nothing re- mained to slay or plunder, the barons gave the signal to retreat, and they repassed the ice. Had they remained an instant longer, Henry IV. would have fallen into their hands; for hardly had they left, before the monar flying from the battle-field, con- ducted fiy a guide named Louis, entered his ruined camp. The battle was over when the detach- ment reached the scene of action. Folk- mar, governor of Prague, had fallen, Henry had fled, and the Bohemians were routed with prodigious slaughter.  The fugitives rallied under the walls of Wart- burg. But they were speedily dispersed and pursued, until nightfall saved them from further molestation. "The mist of Fladenheim   is clearing 26   302   THE TRUCE OF GOD. away," said Rodolph, pointing to the set- ting sun, which now broke out in uncloud- ed splendor, as the fog vanished before a strong north wind. That day was like his life, most brilliant at its close. Otto now advanced, and the two monarchs embraced with mutual affection and esteem. What- ever rivalry there might be between them was' forgotten in success. Henry retired into Franconia and dis- missed his army, and Rodolph again soli- cited the Pope to confirm his election. The news of these victories imparted some consolation to the Lady .Margaret's breast, now torn with anxiety and solici- tude. Her grief was not lightened be- cause her own misfortunes were avenged in Henry's adversity, but because the chances of peace were increased by Ro- dolph's success. She was now incapable of relishing revenge. The feudal antipa- thies so long nourished and so early in- stilled as to be almost a part of her exist- \/   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     303 ence, were entirely eradicated. From the evening of her interview with Father Omnehr, before the now ruined church of the Nativity, she had dedicated her life to the extinguishment of the feud between the- houses of Hers and Stramen. For this she had prayed, for this she had toiled. But her labors were interrupted by the harsh music of war, by gong and tymbalon. What could she do now? Nothing. No- thing? When she knelt before the altar at Tubingen before the sun had risen, and the Countess of Mntfort felt as if she had given shelter to an angel, was she doing nothing? When she lingered in the ora- tory of our Blessed Mother long after the sun had set, and the menials passed by on tiptoe lest they should mar the celestial expression of her face, was she doing no- thing? There had come a deeper lustre still into the Lady Margaret's eye, and the blush on her cheek mingled ret so freely with the pure white in which it was cra-   304   THE TRUCE OF GOD. dled. Perhaps her head was not so erect - perhaps the line of the back had lost in firmness what it gained in grace. Already the men and women of Montfort had learned to love and bless her, and as she passed among them serenely and silently, like a spirit of light, and as they marked the strange transparency -of her features, they would salute her with a feeling in which awe prevailed, and, after thought- fully gazing at her awhile, transfer their glance to the skies. The Lady of Montfort loved to hear the maiden sweetly singing the Salve Regina, for which Humbert had invented or selected a melody of singular beauty--but often, when the hymn was concluded, the countess's cheeks would be bathed in tears, and she would fold the Lady Margaret in her arms, and gaze up earnestly into her face. Gilbert! Gilbert! come read this face of more than earthly beauty! See if the words that haunt you are chiselled there!   CHAPTER IX.

HE   battle of Fladenheim  was fought just as Gregory V-II. was opening his  seventh synod at Rome. Hardly had the ancient canons been renewed and Guibert of Ravenna excommunicated, before the envoys of Rodolph  appeared, and, after reciting Henry's fresh iniquities, supplicated their master's coronation and his rival's deposi- tion. The Pope had not failed to invite his impious antagonist to abide by his deci- d sion, but his recent defeat seemed only to have confirmed his obstinacy. It was evident that Henry would keep the field while a hope of success remained, and that peace could not be recovered but by 26 *      U      305   306   THE TRUCE OF GOD. , the complete triumph of one of the hostile parties. Thejpontiff no longer hesitated. Since all hope of an amicable adjustment had fled, the interests of the Church and of mankind required the ascendency of Rodolph; and Gregory saw that to with- hold his sanction now, was to peril his cause, or at least to prolong the contest. The victory of Fladenheinm had calmed the impetuosity of the Italian nobles who burned to declare for Henry; and they were disposed to preserve a safe neutrality. The cruelties and vices of the Franconian were past endurance; the moment for which the Suabian so patiently and yet so ardently looked, had at length arrived. Rising before the crowded council, the noble pontiff, giving voice to a holy en- thusiasm lie could not restrain, invoked the aid of St. Peter, the prince of Apostles, and of St. Paul, the teacher of the nations. He called upon them to witness, that in spite of his grief, his groans, and his tears,   THE TRUCE OF 'GOD.    307 he had been chosen their most unworthy successor; and that princes, ecclesiastics, and courtesans were leagued to accomplish his death or exile. "By your authority," he exclaims, " relying upon the mercy of God and the pity of his Virgin Mother, I excommunicate Henry and all his par- tisans, and absolve his subjects from their allegiance. And even as Henry is justly deprived of his royalty by his pride, his disobedience, and perfidy, so are the same  power and royal authority granted to Ro- dolph for his humility, his submission, and his merits." The envoys of Rodolph hastened back to Saxony, bearing him the papal confirm- ation of his election and the benediction so fervently pronoqnced. The king and his army were inspired with the most lively joy and confidence. Those who before had dreaded the result, no longer doubted, but deemed the agony of the empire already ended. Mass was cele-   308   TIIE'TRUCE OF GOD. brated amid universal rejoicings; and Saxon and Suabian forgot the desolation of their homes in this presage of victory and peace. The camp of Henry presented another scene. The excommunicated king abandoned himself to the most violent transports of fury. He swore the destruc- tion of the daring pontiff and the usurper who now went forth as the chosen cham- pion of the holy see. He assembled at Mayence thirty bishops and a proud array of princes and barons. Here again was acted the solemn farce of the conventicle of Brixen.  A deee was prepared and published, asserting that it was necessary to cut off from the communion of the faithful, a priest who had been rash enough to deprive the august person of majesty of all participation in the government of the Church, and to strike him with anathema. "He is not the elect of God," runs the in- strument, '" but owes his elevation to his own unblushing fraud and corruption.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     309 Hie has ruined the Church-he has dis- tracted the State; he has. imbittered the life of a pious and peaceful monarch, up- held a perjured rebel, and scattered every- where discord, jealousy, and adultery.

After this sublime invective had been launched, Guibert of Ravenna was unani- mously elected anti-pope, under the name df Clement III. Henry next addressed himself to win the support of England; $   310   THE TRUCE OF GOOD. but Cardinal Lanfranc condemned his pre- cipitation, and refused to unite in these in- sults and outrages. The brief respite from arms that fol- lowed the battle of Fladenheim was over. Hostilities had commenced. Cries of war were heard from every quarter; and while the two kings were mustering their strength for another great struggle, the partisans of Rodolph and Henry were daily mingling in deadly strife. Nor were princes and counts, knights, pages, andzvassals alone in the field, but the spear and sword flashed in the hands of bishops, abbots, and monks. Ulrich, Abbe of Saint Gall, was ravaging Linzgau and Thurgovia, demolishing the castles of Otto of Marchdorf, Marquard of Bregence, and Hartman of Eyburg, and forcing the friends of Rodolph to fly before himn These trivial advantaged were amply compensated by the victory of Welf over   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     3" Frederick of Hohenstaufen, at Hochstadt, and the occupation of Augsburg. It wav in the mont] of October, 1080, that Henry, confiding in the superior numbers and discipline of his army, ad- vanced upon Saxony, where Rodolph calmly awaited his approach. Each mon- *arch well knew that the approaching con- test would be decisive of his fate, and had omitted nothing to insure the victory. Anxious to shorten an!nterval of such painful suspense, they longed to meet-- Henry stimulated by hatred and the mem- ory of his recent defeats, Rodolph ani- mated by a just indignation and conscious rectitude. f Once upon the soil o Saxony, Henry swept the country with firmed sword to the banks of the Elster. He took a strong position at Mulsen, and awaited reinforce- ments from Bohemia. When the desired succor had arrived, he put his army in- motion, intending to desolate the country   312   THE TRUCE OF GOD. and then retire. But he had not advanced far, before he discovered-the allied forces of Saxony and Suabia drawn up to oppose him. Daunted for a moment by this gal- lant host, he fell back upon the Elster. The deep river prevented a farther retreat. His position was protected by narrow and difficult approaches, and by a deep morass. Here he passed the night. Early in the morning of the 15th of October, the army of Henry was drawn up in battle array along the Elster, while the vanguard of his rival became visible in the distance. The soldiers of the for- mer were unwearied and invigorated by a night of repose; the troops of Rodolph were jaded with forced  marches over roads almost. impassable. Rodolph, ap- prehensive lest this fatigue should prove fatal, would have declined an immediate action, but he found it impossible to re- strain the ardor of his men. The knights leaped from their sinking steeds and   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    313 formed themselves on foot, and the in- fantry, forgetting their toil at the sight of the foe, continued to advance. They halted at length on the edge of the deep morass of Grona, in full view of the oppos- ing army on the other side. With Henry were the bishops of Basle and Lausanne with their men-at-arms, the Count Palatine Herman with all Franconia, Marquard of Carinthia, and Lutold, his son. Many recreant Bavarians were around him; and even Suabia raised her arm against her noble duke, in the person of Werner, Archbishop of Strasburg. There, too, were found Ulrich of Eppenstein, Arnaud of Lentzburg, 'Ulrich of Bregence, Lutold of Dillingen, the counts and prelates of the house of Welschneuenburg, Egina of Achalm, and Werner of Gruningen. But conspicuous, even amid that high-born and martial group, stood the Duke Godfrey of Bouillon and Frederick of Hohenstaufen. Rodolph was surrounded by Altman of 27   314   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Constance, and the mitres of Coire, Rhei- nau, Stein, Wurtzburg, and 'Wormis; he could touch the hands of Eckhard of Richenou, of the abbe of ;che Convent of All Saints at Schafhouse, and of William de Hirsau, the most exemplary man of his day. Welf, Otto of Nordheim, Berthdld of Carinthia, and Hugo, Count Palatine of Tubingen, were ready to support him with. their lives, as they marched on proudly at the head of their vassals -and soldiers. Glittering at his side were raised the lances of Marquard of Bregence, Hartman of Dillingen, Burchard of Nellemburg, Cuno and Lutold of Achalm, Werner of Hapsburg, Adalbert of Calw, Albert of Hers, and Sandrit of Stramen. - At the moment the advancing columns halted, the legates of Gregory appeared in front of the army and imparted the papal benediction to all who had taken up arms against the enemy of the Church and of the liberties of Germany. As if a thunderbolt   THE TI4UCE OF GOD.    315 had stricken them down, the soldiers sank simultaneously upon their knees, and, with their heads bent upon their hearts, received the boon so dearly prized. While they yet were kneeling, the clerks began to intone the eighty-second psalm, and the solemn strains could be heard all along the ranks. How sad was the thought, that this calm music was but the prelude to the groans of the dying and the hoarse shouts of blood-stained victory! As the army rose at the last note of the psalm, the clash of steel, instead of the mournful chanf, was heard along the line. Rodolph, pale and thoughtful, but calm and dignified, rode through his columns, uttering brief expressions of encourage- ment and confidence, which were an- swered by cheers that made the wellkin ring. When he had gained an eminence which commanded a view of both armies, a messenger, darting from his side, flew like an arrow toward the column of Welf   316   THE TRUCE OF GOD. of Bavaria. After the lapse of a few min- utes, the Bavarians had turned the morass, and were almost within striking distance of the enemy. Without moving from his position, Frederick of Hohenstaufen waited the assault. The next instant the Bavarians had encountered the Bohemians hand to hand. For a time the combat seemed equal, but at length the division of Welf could be seen slowly falling back. The Suabian nobles, who had hitherto watched the contest in silence and the deepest in- terest, besought the king to permit them to aid the retreating column. But Rodolph firmly refused. He watched the combatants sternly, but without moving a muscle, until the main body of Henry's army was in mo- tion, and then Gilbert could see the smile' he had marked at Fladenheim, curling the hero's lip and lighting up his eye. Yet it was not the same smile: there was some- thing sadder, yet fiercer in it. Never had his eye flashed forth such wild lustre, or :. .   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    3 7 his bosom heaved with such pent-up emo-\ tion.  Then, as the main body of the Saxons pressed rapidly forward under Otto of Nordheim, against the foe disordered by pursuit, and Rodolph sawhis plans accom- plished, he turned to the Archbishop of Mayence, and exclaimed, in a voice broken by deep feeling: "Thle day is ours!" The prelate uttered a prayer of thanks- giving, and, turning to the king, said: "I give your highness joy!" "I may need your prayers rather than your congratulations," replied Rodolph, in a whisper; and he closed his visor. The king still occupied the height from which he had directed the battle, that had now become general. Around him were the chivalry of Suabia and his former faith-  ful subjects, acting in concert with a large body of Saxons. Henry's army was divided into two bodies, one of which, commanded 27 *   318   THE TRUCE OF GOD. by the monarch in person, was engaged with Otto, while the oter, led by God- frey de Bouillon and/Frederick of Ho- henstaufen, assailed tHe Bavarians. Welf, borne down by numbe s, still retreated in obedience to his instructions. "1Our turn has come at last, gentlemen," cried the king. "Forward! ' The barons, who had waited as impa- j tiently as hounds in the leash, required no second bidding, but dashed after their chivalrous monarch, who was in full course with his lance in rest. Already, in Henry's camp, the "Te Deum" was sounding in anticipation of the victory promised by the supposed rout of the Bavarians. But the arrival of Rodolph changed the face of affairs. The strife then began in ear- nest. The enemy recoiled at first before the king's impetuous charge; but they were commanded by the ablest knights' in the empire, and soon recovered from their momentary panic. Foremost of   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    319 all his gallant chiefs,k Rodolph carried death and terror into the Bohemian ranks. He seemed endowed with super- natural strength, and neither lance nor mace could arrest his brilliant career. Wherever the foe was thickest, or the fight most dubious, his white crest gleamed like some fearful meteor. It was difficult for the Suabian nobles to keep up with their invincible monarch, and only by dint of the most extraordinary efforts about twen- ty of the best lances of his army could prevent his falling alone upon the hostile masses. Among those who fought at his side were the lords of Stramen and Hers, Gilbert and Henry, At this moment a band of perhaps thirty horsemen, with their spears in rest, headed by a knight of gigantic size and another whose deeds had proclaimed him equally formidable, came like a thunderbolt through the opening files of the Bohemians, and fell upon the Suabian group. The shock was fearful. r)     . -    r ' f   320   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Many of the combatants were hurled to the earth; but the white plume still waved, and Rodolph of Suabia was in mortal com- bat with Godfrey de Bouillon. The giant had singled out Sandrit of Stramen, who spurred to meet him with equal avidity. In an instant both riders rolled in the dust. The antagonist of Sir Sandrit was the first to rise, and as the knight of $tramen stag- gered to his feet, the battle-axe of his op- ponent was poised above his head. A mo- ment-more and the Lady Margaret would have been an' orphan -for Frederick of Hohenstaufen's strength was not to be baffled by steel casque or bars of proof. But the axe was destined to take another direction. A mounted knight, spurring to the rescue of Sir Sandrit, was within a few bounds of the Lord of Hohenstaufen. Sir Frederick saw his danger, and with wonderful quickness changed his aim, and discharged the ponderous weapon against this new assailant. But the Suabian, dis-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     321 playing equal quickness, fell suddenly upon the neck of his steed, and the flying mass passed harmlessly over his head, graz- ing his crest. But as the rider rose to his seat, a Bohemian knight, darting before Sir Frederick, checked his career. Such was the fury of the onset that both were un- horsed. The saddle-girths of the Suabian had given way, but the Bohemian fell, pierced bythe spear of his antagonist. The former sprang uninjured to his feet, and drawing his sword, rushed against the first object of his attack. Sir Sandrit, dizzy from his first shock, was staggering beneath the heavy blows of his powerful opponent, as the knight whose advance we have marked, crying "' God and Suabia!" turned aside a stroke aimed at the exhausted baron, and stepped between them. "Who are you?" said the Lord of Ho- henstaufen, parrying a blow and return- ing it. "Your shield bears no device; be- ware lest you fall before it obtains one!" V3 ,       tI   322   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "I shall take a device when I have earned one," was the reply. "My name would convey nothing to your ears." "Then perish in your insignificance!" exclaimed the giant, bringing down his sword with bhoth hands. But the blow was avoided with admirable agility, and the combat went on in silence. It seemed as if the struggle could not last an instant, for Frederick towered full a foot above his adversary. But the Lord of Hohenstau- fen was fatigued by his passage with the Baron of Stramen, and his wonderful strength was partially balanced by the superior activity of the Suabian. In the mean time, numbers of Rodolph's knights had now arrived, and the Duke Godfrey was compelled to retreat. Frederick of Hohenstaufen lingered until almost sur- rounded, and then retired slowly before his antagonist, hoping to obtain some ad- vantage from the pursuer's impetuosity.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    323 But the Suabian was as cautious and dangerous as ever.  "Hold, Sir Knight!" said Frederick, suddenly sinking his sword and lowering  his visor. "I beg your name. "I am called Gilbert de Hers," replied the youth, imitating his example. "There," cried the Lord of Hohenstau- fen, throwing down his glove: " wear that for me, and say for Frederick of Hohen- staufen, that he rarely coped with better knight." At these words, the giant mounted a horse which a groom had brought him through the fray, and, waving an adieu, wheeled off to another part of the field. Gilbert raised the gage and fastened it in his casque. There was a strong tumult in the young noble's heart.- In spite of his impulsive disposition, he was never so calm as when in danger. Though sharing the intense excitement of the battle-field, he was not carried away by the frenzy of   324   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the strife. Though the praises of an illus- trious enemy were sounding in his ears, he felt little of the exultation which such a circumstance might naturally impart. He had rescued the Baron of Stramen from imminent peril; but though the Lady Mar- garet's image had been before him through the horror and glory of the day, it was only for a moment that he thrilled at the pros- pect of a relenting father. Iis interview with Rodolph had sunk deep into his soul, and not even the pomp and terror of war could blot from his mind the contempla- tion of the king and his solemn language. He knew not why, but he could scarce withdraw his eyes from the snow-white crest, which, still unwearied, hung upon the now retiring columns of the foe. The Count Rapatho had already fallen before the fiery Rodolph, and the "Te Deum" was hushed as the mangled corpse was brought into Henry's camp. Nor was Otto of Nordheim less success-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    325 ful. At the head of the Saxon infantry, he had routed the legions of Franconia, and had driven numbers into the deep and rapid river. Fruitlessly did Henry en- deavor to preserve his array and keep his ground: he was routed at every point. The Saxons, now certain of victory, would have fallen upon and pillaged the camp. But Otto was too old a warrior to throw caution aside because of a partial success. "Wait a moment!" was all the veteran said, as he checked their appetite for plun- der; and the wisdom of his advice was soon made evident. Henry de Laca, Count Palatine of the Rhine, began to menace his rear. The troops of the count were fresh, and had been proved in former trials. As they advanced with the rapidity and steadi- ness of veterans, singing the "Kyrie elei- son," they seemed well able to retrieve the fortunes of the day. "Another triumph awaits us!" cried Otto; "let us trust in God!" 28   326   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Without hesitating a moment, the gal. lant Saxon, with his wonted impetuosity, fell upon the advancing lines, and, though stubbornly resisted for a time, gained at last a complete victory. When the forces of the Palatine of the Rhine had been driven across the Elster, Otto turned to his soldiers, exclaiming: "Now to the camp, and take the reward of your valor!" In the mean while, the retreat of the Bohemians had turned into a confused flight. Rodolph, in the eagerness of pur- suit, had rashy penetrated too far into the flying masses of the foe, who now turned upon the pursuer. Awhile the white crest danced amid hostile helmets and spears- then vanished. "He is down!" screamed Gilbert, in agony, hewing his way toward the king. Rodolph was alone against a host, while his horse sank up to his knees in the marshy ground. Before succor could ar-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    327 rive a sword had cloven trough the mon- arch's wrist, and his right hand fell to the ground. "It is the hand that I raised when swearing allegiance to Henry," muttered Rodolph, bitterly. With tears in his eyes, Gilbert struggled to reach the king, who, unarmed and disabled, drove his steed against the circle that hemmed him in. His crest was gone, and his armor hacked and stained with blood: still fearlessly he bore up against his foes, and seemed to rejoice in the unequal strife. The chiv- alry of Suabia were spurring fast to the rescue, and Gilbert, now supported by a small band of friends, was almost at his side, when Godfrey de Bouillon charged the king with levelled lance. The steel, impelled by a powerful hand, entered at the groin, and Rodolph, mortally wounded, fell to the ground. The Bohemians uttered a cry of joy at the king's overthrow, for they knew him well by his armor and ac-   328   THE TRUCE OF GOD. tions. Their triumph was short-lived, how- ever, for the Suabians, eager to avenge their leader, gave no quarter, and the vic- torious Saxons had attacked their rear. "Stop not nowj " said Rodolph to the nobles about him; and the lords of Haps- burg, Tubingen, Achalm, Hers, and Stra- men swept on to avenge him. Gilbert remained rooted to the spot. His lance dropped from his hand as he leaped from his horse and knelt beside his monarch. Already the helmet had been removed by one who supported the dying hero in his arms. From Gregory VII. to Pius IX., from the Dominican that accompanied Cortez to the Jesuit who followed a more recent conqueror, the Catholic missionary has been found in the front of battle. It was Father Omehr whose breast now pillowed the monarch's head. Gilbert's heart was almost bursting as he pressed the only remaining hand to his lips and saw that he was recognized. Feeling he   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    329 could not long survive, Rodolph raised his head and asked, in a dying voice, "Whose is the day?" "Yours, my lord, yours! ' replied those who were around him; for Gilbert, unable to speak, did not attempt to answer, but continued to' gaze on the eagle eye over which the film of death was gathering fast. "Yours, my lord, yours," repeated the mourners. At these words, Rodolph fell back in the missionary's arms, saying, '( Then I accept with joy the end to which God has called me. Death no longer dis- turbs me, since it brings victory with it." From this moment he was speechless; and with his gaze earnestly bent upon his shield, that had been raised by a page, and on which was blazoned a crowned lion sleeping upon the knees of the Blessed Virgin, Rodolph of Suabia breathed his last. The calm face of the dead was not paler than Gilbert, who, unmoved by the 28*   330   THE' TRUCE OF GOD. shout of victory, watched the clay that had so lately been - a king. While they bore the body to the royal pavilion, the pursuit was continued with terrible effect. The Saxons remembered the losses they had suffered five years before -the Suabians saw their deso- lated homes and their expiring duke. The small remnant of Henry's army that es- caped the relentless sword and the equally fatal depths of the Elster, were only re- served for a fate still more dreadful. After wandering about, a prey to want and misery, they were now butchered by the peasantry of Saxony and Thuringia, who, armed with hatchets and scythes, flew to avenge upon the relic the wrongs they had suffered from the whole army. Many of the fugitives plunged into the forests, preferring the slow tooth of famine to the swifter stroke of steel. Others, concealing themselves until the first gust of passion was over, besought the mercy of the peas-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     331 antry, who, at last moved with compas- sion or glutted with slaughter, received them as fellow-beings, healed their wounds, and sent them to their homes. Henry of Austria, with a suite little proportioned to his rank, fled to Bohemia. There was none of the exultation of vic- tory in the allied camp that night: each soldier seemed to feel that the conquest had been too dearly won. Rodolph was not only beloved by the Suabians, who from their cradles had experienced his bounty, his virtue, and justice, but he had endeared himself to the Saxons by his affability, his wisdom, and his valor. He had healed their private quarrels and humbled their public enemies; he found them divided and feeble, he left them united and vigor- ous. They regarded him as the saviour of Saxony, and affectionately styled him "Pater patrice." Nor was the griefof the bishops and priests less ardent and sincere, ,     . f   332   THE TRUCE OF GOD. for they felt that a zealous and dauntless defender of the Church had fallen. The soldiers, scattered about in groups, slept little, but whispered to each other, and fixed their eyes upon the torches that burned so steadily in the royal pavilion. 'There was stretched, cold and stiff, the victor of the day, his noble features rigid in death, while-his barons knelt weeping around the bier, and the Archbishop of Mayence recited prayers for his soul. The night wore away, and when the morning broke out cheerfully as though no care were in the world, Gilbert de Hers still knelt be- side the corpse of the king. No tears were in his eyes then, and the expression of  his face varied between deep thought and deep grief. He might have remarked that the scorn had departed from Henry of Stramen's lip; but he did not. His mind was occupied with other things; and silent and sa1, he would not quit his post beside the dead.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    333 Early in the morning of the 16th the victorious army, sadder than defeat could ever have made it, entered Merseburg. After the obsequies had been performed with equal solemnity and magnificence, the body of the king was deposited in the choir of the cathedral. A statue of gilt bronze for many a. year marked the tomb  of Rodolph of Suabia. On the same evening, when the soldiers were scattered through the town, and the nobles had retired to such quarters as they could procure, Gilbert de Hers sought out Father Omehr, and found him in an apartment which the Archbishop of May-. ence had obtained for the missionary. ITp to the day of his interview with Ro- dolph at Mayence, Gilbert's mind had been wholly engrossed with the bright pictures which a vivid and worldly fancy and a keen ambition to excel can always unfold to the eye of youth. At times he remem- bered the -night passed in the missionary's   334   THE TRUCE OF GOD. humble dwelling, when Bertha's knife had confined him there, and he saw again the crucifix and the sacristan. But this was only for a moment. The image of the Lady Margaret was sure to enter and banish every other feeling than that of deep love for her. But from the night of the corona- tion, a change had fallen upon the youth, which Father Omehr's keen eye had not failed to remark. He displayed no longer the same thoughtless gayety or the same dreamy abstraction. He had his reveries, it is true, proceeding from the fear of losing the Lady Margaret, or the hope of gaining - her. The missionary had refrained from questioning the young knight, nor did Gilbert reveal any secret to his venerable friend. Whether he might have recovered his former levity can scarcely be answered; but the death of Rodolph seemed to have extinguished it forever. So great a change had this last incident wrought in him, that it was not only evident to Father Omehr   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     335 and Sir Albert, but all who knew him were struck with his altered manner. They ascribed it to grief alone, for they knew him to have been the moitarch's favorite. When the young noble and the old priest, whose love for each other had steadily increased, had sat awhile in si- lence, the latter took his companion by the hand, and, as the visit seemed to so- licit the question, said, in a tone evincing the interest of a parent: "My son, what ails you?" Then, for the first time, the violent and various feelings which had been aroused in Gilbert's breast found a vent in tears. An hour almost passed away before he could compose himself, and then he only said: "To witness him struck down by death just as he had gained all for which he lived - to see the fruit of thirty years' labor snatched from his lips before he could taste it! O God, for what trifles are we toiling!    336   THE TRUCE OF GOD. It was difficult to recognize Gilbert de Hers in the pale, excited face and trem- bling figure which, with clasped hands and eyes upturned, uttered these meaning words. Another hour passed, and the youth was kneeling at the missionary's feet. Midnight was tolled by the great bell of the cathedral, and Gilbert had risen. "My son," said Father Omehr, as they parted, "you have been taught to despise the world - the next step is to love God1 " Otto of Nordheim and Welf of Bavaria had determined to keep their forces to- gether until apprised of Henry's further designs, and the allied armies rested upon their arms at Merseburg. In the mean time Henry used every artifice to raise an- other army; but such a panic had seized his adherents, that they declared they would rather be swallowed up in the earth than again encounter the Saxons. When Otto and Welfwere thus assured of Henry's *   THE TRUCE OF GOD.     337 immediate inability to injure them, they disbanded the troops which had served them so gallantly. Much as the aoldiers longed to return to their homes, they did not part without some reluctance. They had long toiled side by side in the same glorious cause; they had shared the same dangers and the same pleasures. They had slept and kept watch together. Reminis- cences of hair-breadth escapes and of -mu- tual services had created friendships of no ordinary strength. For many days the dif- ferent troops could be seen evacuating the city under their feudal chiefs, until at last scarce a soldier remained at IMerseburg. It was about the first of November that the barons of Hers and Stramen set out with the relics of their clans for their lord- ships in Suabia. The face of Sandrit of Stramen was sterner than ever, and his son seemed to have caught a portion of his severity. They rode along swiftly, and whenever they spoke it was about the 29      w   338   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Lady Margaret. Father Omehr alone pre- served his equanimity, and even he was now unusually absent and thoughtful. Nor was the retinue of Albert of Hers more cheerful. Sir Albert's eyes-were fixed on the ground in deep dejection; tears were ever and anon springing into Humbert's eyes, and even the vassals -behind them were gloomy and dispirited. They were returning to a desolated home, it is true; but, what was worse, they were returning without Gilbert. The Lady Margaret was still at Tubin- gen. With scarce more fervor did Gregory V l. uphold against the world the measures he deemed essential to the liberty, unity, and purity of the Church, than did this young girl pursue the object to which she had consecrated herself- the extinction of the feud. Humble as were her aim and efforts, when contrasted with the objects and exertions of the: sainted pontiff she could still imitate his piety and perse-   -THE TRUCE OF GOD.    339 verance. The reader may have remarked the changes in the Lady Margaret's char- acter. She was naturally haughty and im- petuous, though generous and sincere. In spite of her piety, that pride, so difficult to curb, would still break out. But these infirmities had been zealously combated, until religion had triumphed over the weakness of humanity. Still, for some time, the Lady Margaret was unhappy, and accused herself of human love in seek- ing the reconciliation, imputing the revo- lution in her feelings to a culpable tender- ness. But she soon discovered that vanity that an aspiration tafter the conscious- ness of perfection rather than true piety- occasioned her uneasiness. She no longer tormented herself with dangerous mis- trusts; but gave all she had to God, beg- ging him to purify the gift and supply her mind with the dispositions to render the offering acceptable. She had learned that most difficult lesson even to the holy-to A ^   340   THE TRUCE OF GOD. hope rather than despond in the conviction of unworthiness. There was one other vic- tory which the Lady Margaret had gained over herself: she had suppressed an incli- nation to return the attachment of Gilbert de Hers, which she clearly saw could only lead to unfortunate results. It was the re- membrance of this inclination that occa- sioned the misgivings which she had' at last obtained grace to disregard. Such was the Lady Margaret at the time of the battle of Elster. She frequently re- verted to the challenge she had given the assailants of Stramen Castle, and detected in that defiance a relic of her former pride. It was the last spark. She was now in daily expectation of her father and brother, and of one almost equally dear -Father Omehr. Her walks were confined to a large room adjoining her chamber, and thence along the cor- ridor to the chapel. Her evening exercise was to walk, supported by the Countess   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    341 of Montfort, to the altar of the Blessed Virgin, and observe the custom of her earliest youth, by leaving there a bunch of flowers. She spent the most of the day in a cushioned chair she was too weak to kneel long. She loved to sit in the sun- light, holding the countess's hand in her own attenuated fingers. Then she would speak of her father and brother, and say that on the morrow they would surely be reunited. She never mentioned sickness or pain; she saw her companion's tears falling fast at times, but she would only wipe them away with a smile and an em- brace. As the sunbeams played upon her wasted features, fringing her hair with gold, and encircling her with a brilliant halo, the countess would turn away from the lovely vision to hide her emotion, and whisper to herself: "This is a glimpse of the world beyond the grave!" 29*   CHAPTER X. We need not mourn for thee, here laid to rest; Earth is thy bed, and not thy grave; the skies Are for thy soul the cradle and the nest; There live!          TASSO OWARD the close of November, on one of those bright warm days, when winter, as if in memory of the departed summer, puts by his blasts and snows, the Countess of Montfort was seated at the bedside of the Lady Mar- garet. The countess, though in the bloom of health and youth, was sad and tearful. The maiden, though her breath was short and difficult, wore a smile upon her lips. The shadow of death was on her sunken temples, and had touched her quivering nostril and waxen ear, through which the light came as through porcelain. Yet the eyes were closed, and the pale lips moved, and the wasted hands, embracing a cru- cifix, were joined in prayer. She could 342   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    343 still beg God to heal the feud. How edi- fying, how beautiful, how sublime the spectacle! - sublimer than the deeds of heroes, the conceptions of poets, the aspi- rations of genius. What is Arehimedes moving the world to the humblest Chris- tian moving heaven by prayer! In a corner of the room a small statue of the immaculate Mother of God stood upon a pedestal.  The marble figure breathed all that purity and simplicity so striking in the images which adorned the old Gothic cathedrals. The eyes of the maiden frequently rested upon it; and as often as sunset came, she would bid the countess place a bunch of flowers at its feet. Thus did she continue to the end of her life the pious custom of her infancy. All was still in the darkened chamber, and the rich tapestry hung mournfully\ from the walls. The things of earth make) the earthly heart ache in the presence oF death. But how joyously the eye of faith   344   THE TRUCE OF GOD. kindled up, as it rested on the face of the meek sufferer! The door opened softly, a light step en- tered, and a female servant whispered some- thing to the countess. She started and looked suddenly at Margaret. The invalid had caught the whisper, low as it was. A slight tinge was visible on her cheek, -as she pressed her white fingers to her breast and said, in a low tone: "God be praised! It is my father! Bring him to me." Is this dying girl his daughter! Is this attenuated form all that remains of his noble, his beautiful, his darling Margaret? Like a blasted pine, the stalwart warrior fell upon his knees, with a groan as if his heart had burst, and buried his face in the curtains. Henry, all tears and sobs, caught his sister's outstretched hand and held it to his heart, gazing in anguish at the ruin of his idol. Behind these kneltFather Omehr. For a moment the man triumphed over   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    345 the Christian, and he too felt the thorn of grief in his throat. But when Margaret's calm eye rested on him, and her meek smile beamed out, he felt that rapture which is only known to the holy, when a soul is happily returning to the bosom whence it came. "Let us thank God for having thus united us!" said the Lady Margaret, and they remained some minutes in silent prayer. "Father!" whispered the invalid. The broad chest was convulsed and the moan deepened, but that bent, crushed figure made no reply. "Father!" she repeated, as her hand fell, in a caress, upon her parent's head. Sir Sandrit, starting at her touch, looked up and seized the hand. A minute had changed his face, as if a year had been ravaging there: it was so furrowed, so haggard. He gazed but an instant at his daughter; then hid his face again, mutter- ing but one word: ' Margaret!"   346   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Father," said the maiden to Father Omehr, who now stood at her pillow, " is Albert of Hers at home!" The missionary nodded. "Let him know that Margaret of Stra- men, on her death-bed, entreated him to fly here without a moment's delay." Even the sound of that hated name pro- duced no perceptible impression upon the heart-broken baron. The Count Montfort, who had just en- tered the room, suddenly exclaimed: "I, myself, will deliver your message, my child, as quickly as horse can speed." Margaret endeavored to thank him' but, exhausted by excitement and exertion, she fell back upon her pillow. The countess prudently led the unresisting father from the room, and despatched -Henry to ad- minister to his grief. "I am changed," said Margaret to the missionary, as she recovered. "God has changed you for himself, my   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    347 child,' replied the old man, struggling with the weakness of human nature, for he had known and loved her from her in- fancy. "I have hoped so, even in the recollec- tion of my many sins; for His mercy is infinite. May JIe uphold and strengthen my father, and teach him to rejoice in the change he now deplores!" The countess left the room, and once more the Lady Margaret opened her soul to her first confessor. The baron knelt all night beside his dying child. He watched her broken Pslumbers, as if he feared each might be Athe last. A thousand sighs of anguish and affection were given and returned be- fore another day began to dawn. How precious are the last hours of life! In our inability to lengthen them, we strive to gather into them more feeling and action than we could extract from as many years. As the sun flashed out the Lady Margaret   348   THE TRUCE OF GOD. seemed animated with new strength. Her father trembled at the suggestion - what if she should recover! Thus hope feeds upon the wishes of the heart. An hour before noon the Count Mont- fort, accompanied by Albert of Hers, en- tered the apartment. Sir Albert, obeying a look which the maiden gave him, ad- vanced, and with much emotion pro- nounced the words, "My lady, I am here!" Sir Sandrit had anticipated all; nor did his son n4anifest the least surprise. They both stood sorrowful and mute, nor did anger and disdain appear in the features with which they were so familiar. Albert of Hers saw, at a glance, the position in which he was placed. "Father!" began the sinking girl- "father! let me die in the assurance of meeting you hereafter. In the name of Him before whom I am soon to appear, forgive this man!"   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    349 The struggle had already taken place in the baron's soul. 'When his heart was trampled in the dust, his pride was broken. The stubborn rock was smitten by the' heaven-directed wand, and the waters of contrition gushed forth. "You have conquered, my child," he murmured, kneeling and kissing her pale forehead. "Not I, my father. God is the con- queror!" It seemed as if her upward glance had rested upon something more than mortal, her face assumed an expression of such unearthly meaning. Sir Albert, too, knelt beside his ancient foe: he felt it impious to stand. The maiden motioned to the countess, who raised and supported her in her arms and drew back the long hair which had partially covered the hollow cheeks. With- out a word, but with an eloquence that must have charmed the attendant angels 30   350   THE TRUCE OF GOD. as much as it entranced the mortals who witnessed it, she placed her father's hand into Sir Albert's right hand, while Henry took the left. "Albert de Hers," said Sir Sandrit, as the tears coursed down his brown cheeks, "I freely forgive you and yours; and never- more shall my hand be raised against you, save in self-defence!" Henry repeated the words after his fa- ther. "And I," said the Lord of Hers, "will forget the past: and I declare, here in the presence of dying innocence, that I am guiltless of your brother's blood!" The Countess of Montfort sobbed aloud, and her husband made no effort to conceal his tears. Father Omehr, who had raised his hands to heaven in an ecstasy of grati- tude, now exclaimed: "Let me speak for one who is not here: Gilbert de Hers has long since forgiven those who were once his father's foes."   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    351 The object of her life was attained -the goal was reached--the victory was won. There lay the victor, supported in the arms of her friend. The victory was hers; for though Heaven had won it, she had won Heaven by prayer.  What are earth's conquests to a victory like this! What the splendid overthrow of nations--what Thermopylae, or Marathon, or Trafalgar to this triumph over long-nourished ha- tred! When does man appear in so mag- nificent an attitude as when, by fervent prayer and complete humility, he con- verts heaven into an agent by which his desires are accomplished! Yet the dying victor felt no pride. Her heart was dissolved in gratitude: she knew her nothingness, and ascribed all to God. She spoke not, she wept not: even the wonted smile forsook her lips. She only felt the immensity of the goodness of God - she only bowed before this new mani- festation of his power. The three knights,   352    THE TRUCE OF GOD. who looked up in her face, saw she was invoking a blessing upon them, and rever- ently bent their heads, as if in the feeling that the blessing was then descending. Young girls clothed in white were noise- lessly strewing with flowers the way by which the adorable sacrament was to pass from the chapel to the chamber. The blessed candle, the emblem of the light of faith and of the lucid mansions, was lit, and the maiden, unable to kneel, received the sacred unction as she lay. Her eyes were closed; and, as if detached from all earthly things, she continued to murmur, almost inaudibly, passages from the Psalms and pious ejaculations. She raised her finger to trace upon her lips the sign of Christ, and then fell into her agony. Three times the bell had tolled when the last absolution was given, and its sol- emn voice still sounded at regular inter- vals, mingling with the sublime words that bade the faint soul go forth from the world   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    353 in the name of God the Father Almighty, who created it, in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God, who suffered for it, in the name of the Holy Spirit, which had been imparted to it: in the name of angels and archangels, in the name of thrones and dominations, in the name of principalities and powers, in the name of cherubim and seraphim, in the name of patriarchs and prophets, in the name of holy apostles and evangelists, in the name of holy martyrs and confessors, in the name of holy monks and hermits, in the name of holy virgins and all the saints of God, that its rest that day might be in peace, and its habitation in holy Zion! There was no struggle, no contortion, to mark the moment of dissolution. The face only grew more serene and less death-like, as the soul passed from its frail tenement. The bells no longer swung slowly and solemnly, but poured forth a festive sound. And well might they peal more merrily 80*     X   354   THE TRUCE OF GOD. then, than at birth, or marriage, or earthly conquest. Tears were falling fast around the bed; yet only the body wept--the soul was exulting. On the morning of the third day after the Lady Margaret's death, a funeral pro- cession could be seen slowly approaching, within sight of the ruins of Stramen Cas- tle and the blackened church of the Nativ- ity. The peasantry, who were expecting it, had gone forth to meet the remains of their dearly loved lady, and rosy children were scattering flowers before the bier. They could not repress some tears and sighs for their benefactress; yet they knew it was for themselves they grieved, not for her they had lost. How they wondered at first -and how their wonder melted into joyous thanksgivings, to see the Lord of Hers supporting the now humble and con- trite Baron of Stramen! The mourners-if such they may be called - entered the grave-yard, which was   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    355 near the church, and had not been violated  by the sacrilegious marauders, and halted before a new-made grave. In those days, it was the peculiar privilege of bishops, abbots, and holy priests to be buried within the church, or only extended to laics of distinguished sanctity. Yet Father Omehr had assured the maiden that she might be interred in the choir at Tiibingen. Mar- garet had declined a privilege of which she deemed herself unworthy; saying that she did not wish to be associated in sepul- ture with those from whom she was far separated in merit, and expressing a wish to be placed beside her mother. And they laid her, with prayers and unbidden tears, in the place she had chosen. The gorgeous sun of ancient Suabia was beaming out in cloudless splendor, and the mountains and the Danube, the forest and the fields looked lovely in the glittering day; yet not one of those who stood around the grave would have said to the   356   THE TRUCE OF GOD. dead, "Awake!" if the word could have recalled her to share the beauty of the world before them. When the Count and Countess of Montfort saw that their longer presence would only impose a restraint upon the family group, they bade the mis- sionary a silent adieu, and began to retrace their steps to Tiibingen. The cottage of the missionary was spared on account of its insignificance; and Fa- ther Omehr led the Lord of Hers and the father and son into his humble apartments, which had been zealously tended by his pious penitents. All was arranged just as he had left it, to his own bed and the cor- ner where Gilbert had slept. There was nothing here to mark the scourge which had desolated the smiling country without. The Baron of Stramen sat down upon a bench, covering his face with his hands. Here, in the sight of his ruined castle, and with the funeral tears of his only daughter undried upon his cheeks, he was happier   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    357 than he had been for many a year: hap- pier than when carousing in his fathers' halls-happier than when proudly em- bracing his darling child-happier than when engaged in avenging his brother- happier than when exulting in the victo- ries of Rodolph! And Henry, too, shared in this blessed change wrought by his sis- ter's prayers. Each heart was too full for speech; words would have fallen meaning- less and cold. At this eloquent moment, a man, ex- hausted with running, and greatly agitated, abruptly entered the cottage. He checked himself, however, and stood as if petrified at the sight of the group before him. Fa- ther Omehr, who rightly judged that his rude intrusion must have been caused by no ordinary occurrence, rose, and in a whisper commanded him to explain him- self. "Bertha seems adying!" said the man. "Where is she?" asked the priest.   358   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "About a mile from here I will take you there." The Baron of Stramen seemed not to listen, for he sat motionless; but his son manifested much interest. "Shall I go with you?" he said to the missionary. "No, my child, remain with your fa- ther." Albert de Hers had started up at the peasant's announcement, and followed Fa- ther Omehr out of the apartment. "Permit me," he said, "to accompany you; I feel that the call is intended for me too. This ring," he continued, holding up his finger, " was given me in my youth by Rodolph of Suabia; in a moment of folly and sin, I parted with it. After an interval of more than twenty years, it was restored to Rodolph by this Bertha, with- out a word of explanation. He gave it to me the night before his death "-here the baron paused an instant --' and informed me how and from whom he had received   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    359 it. I resolved to seek out the woman on my return; for if she be the Bertha to whom I gave this ring, even in her mad- ness she may throw light upon an event hitherto involved in mystery." "You mean the death of Sir Sandrit's brother?" "Yes."  "I see no reason to oppose your wish," said the missionary; "perhaps the mercy of God may choose to reveal what we vainly have endeavored to discover." It was not known how Bertha had es- caped from the castle on the fatal night when it was fired and its inmates put to the sword. Her insanity might have shielded her; or she might have availed herself of the confusion and darkness to elude ob- servation, or extricated herself by some secret passage. A peasant thought he had seen her, by moonlight, walking along the moat of the castle, some days after the hostile army had disappeared; but his ac-   360   THE TRUCE OF GOD. count was discredited until she appeared by daylight to the surviving vassals of Stramen, when they emerged from the for- est in which they had taken refuge. At the time of the return of the soldiers of Stramen, she was much thinner and walked with difficulty; rarely issuing from her re- treat in the ravine, to which she had again retired. On the morning of Margaret's fu- neral she could be seen, pale and haggard, tottering toward the grave-yard. The sim- ple peasants recoiled before the ghastly figure, which, tall and trembling, with a black gown and death-white face, passed among them like a spectre. Before she reached the church she fell senseless to the ground. The humanity of those who ob- served her triumphed over their fears, and they. bore her to a newly finished house hard by. This was all the missionary could glean from his guide, as they walked swiftly to- ward the shed pointed out by-the peasant.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    361 They found her lying motionless upon a bed in a corner of the room. As they en- tered, she opened her eyes, and, after keen- ly scanning the Lord of Hers, raised her- self with difficulty upon her arm. Father Omehr started. The wild light of insanity had left her eyes, and iher glance, though firm and resolute, was gentle and natural. "Do you know me, Bertha?" said the missionary, springing trembling to the bed- side. "Oh, yes," was the reply. "I have been in a long, wild dream!" and she passed her hand over her high, clammy forehead. "And I know you, Sir Albert of Hers; and I know that God has brought you here at this moment." The stout warrior, who never quailed before any odds, and whose self-possession was as remarkable as his valor, quivered before the mournful gaze of that weak woman. The room seemed to reel, and he leaned against the wall for support. 31   362   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "There is one other I must see Sandrit of Stramen. Father, have him brought here now; there is not one moment to be lost." The missionary whispered a few words to a youth who was present, and the strip- ling passed hurriedly out. "Ilave you sent for him?" she in- quired. "Yes." "Will he soon be here?" "He is scarce a mile off." "It is well," she continued, lifting up her large black eyes; "God has designed it all! And now," she resumed, after a brief pause, "we must be alone until the baron comes." At a signal from the missionary, Albert of Hers and the wondering peasants si- lently withdrew. The half hour that elapsed before Sir Sandrit's appearance, seemed like an age to the Baron of Hers, who in an agony of   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    363 suspense paced up and down the clearing before the cottage. At last, however, the two noblemen and Henry of Stramen were admitted. Bertha was sitting upright in bed, sup- ported by Father Omehr, who beckoned to Henry to assist him. There were traces of recent tears upon her furrowed cheeks, and her form seemed to dilate as she gazed at the nobles before her. Listen to me, Baron of Stramen!" she began, looking full at the noble, in whom surprise was gaining a temporary mastery over grief; " listen, for it is God's mercy that permits me to speak and you to hear! Twenty years ago I was young and beau- tiful. I was loved by your brother and by him who stands at your side." Albert de Hers turned pale as death, and drawing the ring from his finger, advanced a step, saying hoarsely, "Are you the Ber- tha to whom I gave this ring?"   364   THE TRUCE OF GOD. She took the trinket in her hand, and after examining it over and over, replied: "I am that Bertha. But how did you get this?" "From the Duke Rodolph, to whom you gave it." The woman knit her brows, as if strug- gling to recall some confused impression, and at length said: "Yes, I did give it to him; I remember now. Where is he?" "In heaven, I trust," replied the Lord of Hers. At the word heaven, the tears started in the eyes of the poor creature, and she hung her head. The silence was profound and painful. She was the first to break it. "Interrupt me no more," she said, sup- pressing her emotion. "Hear me through. Robert of Stramen and Albert of Hers were rivals for my love, and they began to hate each other bitterly on my account. I loved neither; for I had promised to marry Albert of the Thorn, and I loved him as   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    365 much as my vain heart was able to love anything. But I was weak enough to re- ceive the presents they gave me for the sake of wearing the fir cry; and my lover was pleased, because we were poor. My Lord of Stramen, do you remember the day we brought you your brother's corpse?" The baron shuddered. "On that very morning - oh! how dis- tinctly do I see it -I was sitting in the ravine, not far from my mother's house, when a wild boar pursued by hounds rushed madly by me. As I stood trembling, a horseman followed, dashing along at full speed. He reined up when he saw me. It was the Lord of Hers. He began to smile, and asked me to forgive him the fright he had given me, and, untying a scarf which he wore around his waist, threw it over my shoulders. Then he put this ring on my finger and galloped off, crying he must not miss the stand. This much you know, 31*   366   THE TRUCE OF GOD. Albert of Hers, but you do not know what followed. Was it not as I have said!" The noble nodded. "O God, strengthen me to reveal all!" continued the now agitated woman. "I began to walk down the ravine, when I met Albert of the Thorn. I slowed him my presents, and we sat down at the foot of a pile of steep rocks, beside a little spring. Albert was arranging the scarf about my neck, when Sir Robert of Stra- men suddenly stood before us. His face was pale with rage, and his lips were all foaming. I screamed at his awful appear- ance. I knew well that he hated my be- trothed, and had threatened his life if he married me. He snatched the scarf from my neck, and shaking it at me, said: I know very well from whom this came!' Then, turning upon Albert, he cried: 'And for you, who pretend to love her, to connive at his guilt! You shall pay for your baseness with your life!' He stopped   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    367 here, as if rage had choked him, and drew his sword. Albert sprang quickly up the ledge of rocks, and Sir Robert followed. I saw Albert stoop, pick up a large fragment of rock, and hurl it-I saw Sir Robert fall, and then I grew sick and dizzy, and fainted. When I recovered, Albert was watching me, trembling and livid. I looked around, and there was Sir Robert, stretched out stiff and still and bloody. He had worn nothing but a light cap on his head, and the stone had made a fearful dent in his temple. I knelt beside him, and prayed, and chafed his hands, and brought water from the spring and poured it upon his face. I hoped he would come to life, even if he would only revive to kill me. It was  all in vain. He grew cold: he was dead.  Again I looked at Albert- he was shak- ing like a leaf. 'Bertha,' he said,'I am a lost man! When Sir Sandrit knows this, I cease to live.' I saw his danger; which did not until then occur to me, and I lost I,   368   THE TRUCE OF GOD. my concern for the dead in my fears for him. I loved him better than anything in the world, and the devil, who knew my heart, suggested a scheme for his preserva- tion. The scarf of the Lord of Hers, which bore some family device, was grasped by the dead man's hand, and I saw at once how strongly that circumstance implied the noble's guilt. I concealed the ring he had given me in my pocket. ' Come!' I said to Albert, 'let us take the body to Sir Sandrit, and tell him that we found it in a spot from which we had just seen the Lard of Hers depart.' He refused at first, and would not touch the body; but by argu- ment and entreaty, I prevailed upon him to be guided by me.  "Sandrit of Stramen, you know the rest. You know that we swore to have seen the Lord of Hers ride away from the fatal spot just before we found the body. It was the fact; but my lover and I were perjured in the sight of God. I do not wish to lighten my crime before men, when it is written out so plainly against me before angels. I was a perjured woman - perjured through love and fear. I heard you swear ven- geance. I wept, but I was silent. I saw your fury and your wars: my heart bled,   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    369 but I was silent. There was no rest, no sleep, no peace for me. It was not my husband's death that drove me mad. Oh, no! It was remorse. There were spec- tres all around me-I trembled before the innocent, fled before the guilty. The ca- resses of my child that died at my breast tortured me; I felt as though my breath had withered and polluted it. Every hour was full of misery -day and night there was a gnawing at my heart. At last my mind gave way, and the justice of heaven struck him with death and me with mad- ness " Bertha paused an instant, quite ex- hausted; then again exerting herself, she said: "I do not ask you to forgive me -but forgive each other." "They have forgiven each other al- ready," said Father Omehr. 'They are friends." "Friends?" "The Lady Margaret reconciled them on her death-bed." "The Lady Margaret dead!" "She was buried this morning." "Yes," said Bertha, "it was to her fu- neral I was going. Yes, she is dead- the Y   370   THE TRUCE OF GOD. beautiful, the young, the innocent-she has been praying for me in heaven." At these words a smile beamed over her sharp features, and she sank gradually back in bed, lowered by Henry and the mis- sionary. The proud Lord of Hers was, in spirit, in sackcloth and ashes. He attributed the existence of the feud to his indiscretion and guilt, and reproached himself with all its pernicious consequences. He saw in the wreck before him the fruits of his sin: Bertha's misery and madness seemed whol- ly his own unhallowed work. The strong man shuddered at the consequences of his folly, and beat his breast, and wept like a child. Sandrit of Stramen also accused him- self of having caused the feud by his rash credulity, and driven Bertha to perjury and insanity by his impetuous and uncontrol- lable temper. For, he reasoned, had she reposed any confidence in his justice and charity, she would have told the truth. Henry of Stramen saw that all his bril- liant achievements against the family of Hers were only unjustifiable murders and robberies; and his haughty spirit was hum- ble and contrite. I;   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    371 Father Omehr saw their contrition, but he was entirely absorbed in the penitent Bertha. Bertha lived three days after the revela- tion, constantly engaged in prayer and acts of contrition. Her profound sorrow affect- ed and edified the missionary and all the neighborhood. On the third day she re- ceived the viaticum, and expired in the arms of the Baron of Stramen, who, to- gether with the Lord of Hers, had repeat- edly assured her of their complete forgive- ness. Her last words were: "I know she is praying for me in heaven." She was buried, as she desired, near the Lady Margaret, with nothing but a rude wooden cross to mark her grave. On the day after her burial, Father Omehr and the three nobles set out for the Castle of Hers. Humbert had already fitted up for his lord some rooms which had been only partially consumed; and Albert of Hers had prevailed upon the baron and his son to remain with him until they could find suitable lodgings at home. The reconciliation between the nobles was complete; and at sunrise the next day they could be seen kneeling together be- fore the altar of the Pilgrim's Chapel, eat-   372   THE TRUCE OF GOD. ing the bread of life. If the angels rejoice at such a sight, how much greater must be the joy of the saints! But where was Gilbert, that he could not share in the blessed feast? The middle ages abound in characters better entitled to our consideration and es- teem than the classic magnates of Greece and Rome. There is not in pagan antiqui- ty such a combination of virtue, constan- cy, fortitude, and valor as was present- ed in Matilda of Tuscany, "the heroine of the middle ages." She devoted herself to the cause of the holy see so early as 1064, and her life was a series of sacrifices cheerfully made for the security of the Church. While wondering at her hero- ism, you love her for her charity, and re- vere her for her piety. Let Catholics read her life, and they will embalm her in their hearts. Her unvarnished actions are a no- bler eulogy than even the unfading wreath flung by a master's hand on the grave of the martyred Marie Antoinette. At the time of the battle of the Elster, this pious defender of the faith was sorely pressed by the Lombards, who sided with the emperor. The imperial troops had gained a victory at Mantua, which revived the drooping royal cause.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    373 When Gilbert de Hers parted from his father and friends, he turned his horse's head to Matilda's camp. The partisans of the heroic princess took little notice of the nameless knight who came among them without follower or page, and whose shield was simply blazoned with an azure cross. He was silent and reserved, shrinking from observation and mirth, and either engaged in meditation or prayer. The gloomy aspect of the future was also capable of furnishing the youth with suf- ficient food for reflection. The death of Rodolph spread consternation over Saxony and Suabia: both circles were crippled by internal dissensions, and unable to profit by their victory. Inspired by this, and by his rival's death, and encouraged by the attitude and successes of the Lombards, Henry meditated an invasion of Italy, and the conquest of Rome itself. He reorgan- ized a powerful army, and penetrated Lom- bardy, leaving Frederick of Hohenstaufen to hold Suabia in check, while Saxony was convulsed by the rival schemes of Otto and Herman. Never before had the holy see seemed in such imminent danger. England and France looked coldly on, and the emperor 82   374   THE TRUCE OF GOD. of the East sympathized with his brother of Austria. Gregory alone awaited the storm calm and fearless, relying upon the sacredness and justice of his cause, neither dismayed nor discouraged by the fickle course of hu- man events. He deplored the spirit which arrayed itself against truth; but he found in-the recollection of the trials of the Apos- tles and their successors abundant consola- tion for himself and his friends. Florence, Padua, Cremona, Milan had fallen before the Austrian invader; Lucca swelled the triumphs of the tyrant: fortress after for- tress was wrested from Matilda; Henry sat down before the gates of Rome at last, in the plains of Nero and opposite the fortress of St. Peter. Yet the sublime pontiff dis- played no symptom of uneasiness, though half of Europe was against him. Gilbert's first impulse was to fly to Rome; but the approaches to the city were all in possession of the enemy; the noble Ma- tilda could ill spare a good lance, and the Romans then displayed so much resolution and gallantry, that the German army was repulsed in every assault. To the young knight's heart, wounded by the siege of Rome and misfortunes of Matilda, the tid-   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    375 ings of the reconciliation at home were like a sweet balsam. And though the blessed intelligence was blended with the account of the Lady Margaret's death, it was not the less welcome. Gilbert had long since ceased to regard the Lady Mar- garet with human love: he revered her as one sacred to Heaven, upon whom death had already set the seal of eternity; and, far from weeping over her early grave, he exulted at her triumphant flight to the judgment-seat of God. Two long years crept by, and the impe- rialists were still before Rome. Gilbert looked anxiously for succor to Suabia and Saxony; but the sudden death of Otto of Nordheim laid his hopes in the dust, and Henry, for the third time, invested the eternal city. Hitherto, the Romans, en- couraged by the Pope, had made an heroic resistance, and the besiegers had suffered incredibly from their desperate sallies, as well as from the diseases that decimated them. But the fidelity of the citizens was beginning to totter beneath the protracted warfare, and many sighed for a period to their calamities. Henry failed not to profit by these dispositions, and poured in thirty thousand golden florins to inflame them. The horizon grew darker and darker-   376   THE TRUCE OF GOD. the Pope more winning, more eloquent, more determined. Matilda did not fail him in this crisis. The knight of the azure cross had already won the confidence of the princess by his valor, his prudence, and his piety, and she now selected him as the in- strument of her generosity. She pointed to a large amount of silver, saying that she intrusted him with the dangerous and difficult duty of conveying it to Gregory. Gilbert gladly accepted the perilous com- mission. lie loaded a number of mules with the treasure, concealed beneath vege- tables, and disguising himself as a peasant, took a guide and set out for Rome. Dur- ing a dark and stormy night he contrived to pierce the hostile lines and enter the city by the Lateran gate. Gilbert found the Pope seated in the midst of an assembly; he could at last feast his eyes upon the wonderful and sainted man whom he had all his life loved and venerated. When the pontiff rose and spoke of the virtue and fortitude that ought to sustain them in this crisis, he seemed endowed with supernatural power, and moved all present to tears. It seemed as though his soul foreknew it was the last time his voice should be raised in defence of his grand and holy cause.   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    3" Another year passed by; the festival of Easter was approaching: Henry was medi- tating a return to Germany, when a depu- tation of the citizens arrived in his camp, offering to surrender the capital. The La- teran gate was opened, and the imperial army began to enter the city. The Roman soldiers, finding themselves betrayed, flew to arms, and Gilbert de Hers was once more contending with the warriors he had met at Fladenheim and the Elster. God- frey de Bouillon fell wounded before the desperate resolution of the besieged, and as he was brought to his knee, vowed a pil- grimage to the Holy Land. But, outnum- bered and confused, the defenders were driven into the citadel, and Henry, with his queen at his side, entered in triumph. The next day Guibert of Ravenna was in- stalled in the Lateran palace in the see of St. Peter, and consecrated on the twenty- fourth of March, by the bishops of Modena and Arezzo. His first act was to crown King Henry in the Vatican. Gregory re- tired to the chateau of St. Angelo, and the giddy populace greeted the antipope with shouts ofjoy. A severe chastisement await- ed their perfidy and inconstancy. Robert Guiscard was advancing with thirty thou- 82*   378   THE TRUCE OF GOD. sand infantry and six thousand cavalry, and Henry fled before the redoubtable prince, whom he had provoked by an alliance with Alexis, the Emperor of the East. Aban- doned by Henry, who had returned to Aus- tria, the treacherous Romans barred their gates. Robert asked admission, but in vain; and his irritated soldiers forced their way at midnight through the Flaminian' gate. The city was crimsoned with flame and sword. A body of Saracens formed part of the Norman's army, and their fury knew no bounds. So general was the mu- tilation, that instant death was accounted a blessing. From three points of the city the flames were streaming. Scarce could the papal guards preserve a portion of the churches from pillage and destruction. St. Sylvester's and St. Lawrence were wrapped in fire, and the basilicas, from the quarter of Lateran to the Coliseum, were involved in the red ruin. For three days the con- queror raged like a lion in the capital of the Christian world. The frenzied people again attempted resistance, and again the streets ran with their blood. When, gorged with slaughter and booty, the ferocious conquerors had evacuated the city, Grego- ry and his attendants re-entered Rome and occupied the Lateran palace. He lingered   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    379 in the venal city only long enough to con- voke a council and renew his anathemas against Henry and Guibert, and then re- tired to Monte Casino. Gilbert was not permitted to accompany the pontiff to his retreat, but was dispatch- ed to Matilda with an account of all that had occurred. He found the magnanimous 'princess threatened by an army more than treble her own. But she was undismayed and full of hope, meditating a bold enter- prise that was crowned with success. In the dead of night, when the imperialists, secure in their numerical superiority, were plunged in sleep, she led the relic of her troops into the hostile camp. The sleep- ers awoke to the cry of "St. Peter! St. Peter!" and perished ere they could grasp their arms. The chivalry and no- bility of Lombardy were well-nigh exter- minated: in a few hours, corpses and tents alone remained of the hostile array. Why should not Sorbara be as magical a word as Thermopylae? It would be, if the Chris- tian chroniclers had shared the pride or shown the polish of Grecian historians, and if modern Christians felt a Grecian en- thusiasm for the deeds of their Christian ancestors. Matilda differed from Leoni-   380   THE TRUCE OF GOD. das but in one respect--in surviving the action and remaining victor on the field. Some days after the battle, Gilbert was summoned into Matilda's presence. "I own you more," she said, " than I can ever repay. Your former voluntary services and fidelity are enhanced by your brilliant exploits in this last victory. Be pleased to style yourself governor of Mo- dena." Gilbert advanced a step, and sinking upon one knee, replied: "Madam, I came to share in your gen- erous devotion to our common father, and to assist you as best I could. You are now-thanks to your own valor-vic- torious and secure. I must decline your bounty, for from this moment I renounce the soldier. Here is my sword, madam; since Rome and you no longer require it, I shall not need it; nowhere would I more willingly resign it than thus at your feet." As the morning dawned, Gilbert de Hers, accompanied by a troop of horse, set out for Monte Casino. Gregory had retired to Salerno, where he passed his days in the- contemplation of heavenly things, and in reading the lives of the saints and ecclesiastical his- tory. Gilbert soon heard of his increasing   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    381 weakness: the sun that had poured its light over the world, despite the mists and clouds of error and vice, was setting at last. How his dying words bespeak the saint: "My best-loved friends, I count my labors nothing: that which gives me confidence is the consciousness of having loved justice and hated iniquity!"When his assistants, groaning in anguish, adverted to their deso- late condition after his death, he raised his arms to heaven, exclaiming, "I will ascend there, and plead your cause before a God supremely good!" On the 25th of May, 1085, were uttered those memorable words that smote the forehead of guilty Europe as if with a burning brand: "I have loved justice and hated iniquity- therefore I die in exile." Years passed by. Peace smiled once more in the lordships of Hers and Stra- men. A new dwelling had risen from the ashes of Stramen Castle. The church of the Nativity was repaired, and again hung in beauty over the faithful who flocked there to worship. Yet there was a stranger priest at the altar, and often after mass the people would gather around a marble slab just before the altar, on which was written:   382   THE TRUCE OF GOD. "Credo quod Rededmptor mceus vivit." This was the tomb of Father Omehr; his epitaph was written and treasured in the hearts of all who knew him, and, transmitted from sire to son, required no foreign chisel to deepen the impression upon the living tablet. The Lords of Stramen and Hers were often together, and were beloved by their vassals for their uniform courtesy and charity. Their hairs were whitening; and when Sir Sandrit walked to the church- yard he leaned upon Henry's arm. Years passed by. Henry IV., worn down by misfortune and the rebellion of his eld- est son, for his own offspring held up the poisoned chalice to his lips, had follow- ed his sainted antagonist to the eternal tribunal, and his body had been cast out as excommunicated from its sepulchre; the male line of the Franconian emperors had expired in Henry V.; Lotlaire of Saxony, a zealous champion of Rome, had been elevated to the throne. Time was revealing that Gregory VII. was trium- phant even in death; for the right of inves- titure was conceded to the Pope, and the celibacy of the clergy strictly enforced. The Lords of Stramen and Hers were   THE TRUCE OF GOD.    383 sleeping with their fathers. The hill on which the Pilgrim's chapel still stood was no longer crowned with a castle, but with a monastery occupied by Benedictine monks. The whole lordship of Hers was blooming under their munificent adminis- tration. Humbert, whose long locks had now seen eighty winters, still lived at the foot of the hill, surrounded by a good- ly number of stalwart sons and fair-haired daughters. And sometimes in the long winter evenings, when the fire sparkled bright and the old man was garrulous with joy, he would tell how he once entered a lhostile castle as a minnesinger with a noble lover, and how the knight defied the angry father. Yet he never revealed that this knight was the generous abbot who now supplied them with the means of in- nocent mirth, who ministered to all their wants, and whose life was so meek and blameless. For Gilbert de Hers was abbot in the cells that had once been the halls of his sires. And one word, reader: It was not after the Lady Margaret's death that he em- braced the resolution of dedicating him- self to God, but on the battle-field of Elster, and over the corpse of Rodolph of Suabia. He had proved his sincerity   384   THE TRUCE OF GOD. in the wars of Matilda; and when he quitted the princess for Monte Casing, it was to assume the habit of the novice. One bright afternoon in the fall of 1126, two aged men were walking arm-in-arm toward the church of the Nativity. One was attired as a Benedictine, the other as a knight. They stopped at the church and before a cluster of tombs. On one of the slabs was carved a Greek cross with a single tear under it, and beneath the tear the words: "O crux sancta adjuva nos." It was the resting-place of the Lady Margaret, between the graves of her father and mother. The monk and the knight knelt down and prayed. As they rose, the bells of the church announced the close of day, and ushered in the TRUCE OF GOD. With their bosoms heaving with recol- lections of the past, Gilbert of Her and Henry of Stramen went into the church where fifty years before they had met in youth and enmity; and they knelt to- gether beside the grave of Father Omehr, with their hearts full of tenderness and hope and love, while the sun of ancient Suabia was setting, and the bells poured forth their silvery peal.
