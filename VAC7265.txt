            NARRATIVE OF LEONI LOUDON. 
             
               CHAPTER I. 
               In one of the wilds of Western Virginia, remote from the noisy strife and din of war, where no rude hand had ever been to disturb that peaceful abode, dwelt Marcus Loudon, a man well advanced in years. His white locks hung almost to his shoulder and his step was feeble. Beside him was his daughter. Leoni's eyes were blue, but so dark, that it was hard at times to tell their hue; her hair, massive, and of a rich brown, floated out upon the wind as she followed close upon the steps of her father in the pursuit of the deer and birds, sports which he loved; her quick tread and keen eye marked the game, and while the old man, exulting in the wildness of the scene around, paused to drink in the landscape, Leoni brought to his feet the fleeing bird, with her fleet arrow, ere his eye could descry its place of concealment. Oft had the aged parent gazed fondly upon her, and exclaimed, "Would that thou wert a boy, my girl, thy heart as noble and thy courage as great-thy mother was weak and timid by nature, but thou art like thy father; I tremble for thee, Leoni-would that for thy sake I might survive this struggle." 
               "Fear not for me, dear father; the God that has taken care of thee will also take care of me." 
               "Well, well," sighed the old man, "it may be, but the timed are sadly changed, my child-we know not at what moment we may be aroused from our beds by the entrance of murderers-these insurrectionists are capable of any outrage; lately they have derided my principled; they seek to trouble me in many ways; they shoot down my nests; spoil my fenced, and taunt me on the high road. You, Leoni, what will become of you when I am gone? Even young Frederick, whom we thought so true, has forsaken us. Would that the lips that were false to thee had perished ere it pronounced the word. Why! What ails thee, child, art thou sick? I spoke too freely-I should not-I will not; come, sit on my knee, and forgive thy father, he forgot-I believe we said," continued the old man, in a faltering voice, "that we would not speak of him again; was it so, child?" 
               On her darkened brow, Marcus gazed lovingly yet distrustfully. 
               "Even so, father," faltered Leoni, "but you have done nothing, I am only weak-so weak, that sometimes when that name, once so dear, is pronounced, a strange thrill goes through my frame, I lose myself; but we must-we must forget him. I will be stronger, father; I will conquer this feeling. But what makes thee so sad? Thy brow looks troubled, has ought happened to vex thee?" 
               While the girl spoke, she folded her arms tenderly around him, as ever and anon a glistening tear fell upon his white locks, an emotion she could not suppress, excited by the allusion made to Frederick Brenton, now a traitor to his country and a perjurer to the most sacred vows to one of earth's noblest maidens. The old man knew part, but he did not know how great had been the struggle. He had noticed that the roses were fading from Leoni's cheek, and complained that her laugh was not so joyous, but he knew not how many sleepless nights and hours of watching had been passed, for the loving girl told him not. Hope had died within her, but a spark had been kindled never to be extinguished. So she toiled on. 
               Frederick Brenton was one of a long race, that is, he was tall and gaunt, spoke largely of belonging to one of the First Families, and never omitted his immediate descent from Pocahontus-indeed, Grandfather Brenton had her portrait in his library, and Frederick himself was said to resemble her. His home was among the mountains; a plantation in good condition, and stocked with thirty-five negroes, was his particular portion; all he wanted beside, was the heart of Leoni Loudon. By stealth he won this. The good Julius longed to see his child settled ere he passed away, and would have given her to the youth, whom he deemed loyal and true. The evil day came; Frederick was mounted on the steed of rebellion, and came in his new glory to carry off his prize. Now came the conflict. The truth at length forced itself upon the mind of the proud descendant of Pocahontus, "that freemen do not bow down to slave-holders or succumb to First Family traditions; that a nobleman may live in the cottage as well as the castle, and maintain his rights as well," finally, that "poor whites" must be respected, and that even Indian royalty could not persuade the noble Leoni from her duty. 
               Time wore on; there was a raid in that section of the country. Every hour brought news of fresh ravages among the Unionists, who remained unprotected. The old man trembled. His faithful dog lay at the door, and the inhabitants of the forests passed by unmolested; the birds sang above and around; the fox strayed over his meadow, and the gun was forgotten. 
               A mouth had sped-a mouth of depredation. The shadows were lengthening, the day was drawing to its close, as night's sable mantle was gently stealing over nature and clothing in mournful beauty that spot, shut in from the world, called "Home, sweet home" by Leoni, the brave-hearted girl of the wild. The old man had lain down to rest, the war of life was almost over-his career nearly run, and as he gazed fondly upon the face of Leoni, his pride, his joy, he tried to be resigned. 
               "The fire still burns, my child, yet a little longer and all will be well; my white hairs go not sorrowing to the grave, but as one that rejoiceth. Could I see thee settled, the could I die content." 
               "Fear not for me, dear father," replied the weeping girl, "thy days may be many, and we can yet live." 
               "True, my child, but they have taken away our goods, my hard earnings and thine; they have killed our noble watch-dog, and left us unprotected. Our horses also, are gone; no more shalt thou ride beside me, my girl, in the chase. Ah! could my old limbs once more mount poor Grey, and thou the other, then would thy father be happy." 
               "True, father, we have lost these, yet we may be happy." 
               "Leoni, they have stolen our corn; we must look to our wants. What must be done?" 
               "I can walk over to good minister Brow's, and tell them." 
               "He is as bad off as we are, my child. Young Robinson, from the mill, told me but yesterday, that his poor sick wife and child had not a bed to he upon, and the Minister the same." 
               "Why this outrage, father, upon such a quiet, good man as Robinson, who never offends any one?" 
               "It is so, my child; when evil passions get the upper hand, it is the same with nations as with individuals. Our country is now in a bad state; be firm, Leoni, be true, the flag demands it. I shall be cold in death long ere this trouble shall have ceased. Wrap me in the colors of my country, my girl, and let it be known that Julius was true to the last." 
               "Father droop not so. Hark! I hear the guns,-where can they be?" 
               "The wind, my child, carries the sound; it takes me back to the days when I was young-but where is my bugle, Leoni? Bring it hither, that I may try to recall the memories of the past." 
               The old man held the time-worn instrument to his mouth, but the effort was a feeble one. As each note was extracted and fell upon the ear of the sorrowing girl, a tear dropped from the heavy lids, stiffened with silent weeping; strange and eventful were the memories which came rushing over her mind with every sound. 
                
               Upon the green beside their cottage door, she had listened oft to the words of love, spoken by Frederick Brenton, while confidingly she leaned upon that manly form, dreaming only of happiness; when, apparently unconscious of all around, the old man had beguiled the hour with his bugle, though keeping a strict watch upon the young man and a loving one upon his innocent child. 
               "Take the bugle, Leoni," said the old man, "I am too weak; thou canst play a little for thy father, I have taught thee well." 
               Leoni played. 
               "Would that thou wert a boy, with that playing thou could'st fill thy father's place. I'm proud of thee, Leoni. When yet a stripling, I rode with the army, and it was said, no one played the bugle like the boy Julius, and thou do'est as well." 
               "I wish I was a boy, father; then, indeed, would I follow thy foot-steps,' sighed Leoni. 
               "Come and embrace me, brave girl; be true as thy old father has been; uphold the Union; never stoop to do a wrong, and when my ashes he in the ground, remember they were true ashes. Now play me one more tune, Leoni," faintly spoke the old man, "for I am weary and must sleep." 
               Leoni played. 
               She noticed not that her father slept, and that the grey light of the morning had crept into the window. What strange, wild thoughts had filled her brain? What infatuation hung about that worn-out bugle? What had that slight, elastic figure to do with the sad, old instrument? What dark thought made that clear brow lower? What intention in the measured step and word of command? Why gaze on far-spreading fields, and then, as if recalled to earth and the realities of life, hide the guilty bugle and hurry to the bedside of her father? 
               The candle was flickering in its socket-a moment, and the flame expired. Amidst the wailing tones of Leoni, the tried spirit had taken its flight. For some time, the solemnity of the scene and the hour, kept the astonished girl spell-bound. With eyes riveted upon that loved face, and hands clasped, she stood gazing; recovering from her surprise, she felt the cold form, the lifeless pulse, kissed the inanimate lips, and parted the white locks. No tear fell to relieve the over-charged heart. Long beside that loved body sat Leoni, unwilling, unresigned; no kind hand stretched out to help; no good Samaritan was near. At length came the flood of tears-and the heart, though weakened, was relieved. 
               Help must be found-the old man must be laid beneath the sod, and Leoni, alas! what will become of thee? Deceived and wronged, yet noble and brave. 
                
               The rolling cannon was dimly heard in the distance, and young Robinson, from the mill, was strangely moved to visit Marcus, to tell him the news-instead of which he beheld the scene of death, and the pale mourner. After comforting the sorrowing girl, and promising speedy assistance, he repaired to his home to inform his wife, who soon returned with all necessary aid. We will pass over the events of the burial, which took place as soon as proper arrangements could be made. Suffice, that the spot selected was an old piece of ground that lay on a hill richly covered with trees, beneath whose towering branches was a dense underbrush in some places and clumps of small pines in others. From the top of this hill the country could be seen for miles around. In this abode of the dead reposed many Virginia ancestry, especially those of the First Families. Those of the second and third gained admittance sometimes. To one of these I suppose old Marcus belonged, for certain it is, that he had a grave the full length, all to himself, beside his wife. 
               Leoni regarded her mother's grave with trembling emotion. She stood beside the cold earth until the last shovel full was thrown in and the mound covered with the nicely cut sods. When she turned from the spot which contained all she held dear, she was an altered being; she had made a strange and desperate resolve. 
               Robinson and his wife urged her to go home with them and share what little had been left after the plunder, but the grieved spirit of Leoni preferred her lonely cottage and its solitude; it best suited her feelings-so, dashing away the fast gathering tears, she expressed her gratitude, and they parted. 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               'Twas night! Alone beside the empty couch, sat the desolate girl. Neither doors or windows were barred to keep out intruders. Fearlessly she remained, unmoved by any emotion save grief. Frederick Brenton would steal into her sorrows; she had fondly loved him, but he had proved himself unworthy. Why not cash him from her thoughts forever? Leoni tried; but ever a stray memory of the past crept into her heart. The yearnings for sympathy were calling him back. Had the traitor appeared at that moment and fallen at her feet, she would have forgiven him. 
               Alas! what a terrible thing it is to trifle with the deepest and holiest feelings of which human nature is capable. There is a sublimity in the natural outburst of the young heart's first love,-of its deep sympathy and yearnings; like the rose not watered, it yields its perfume and dies. What sinking follows-what bereavement-what joyless days and sleepless nights? Such was the sad experience of Leoni Loudon-but now she taught herself her daily lesson, to banish from her heart every vestige of love for the villain with whom she had been associated. Henceforth he was a dead letter, to be forgotten. 
               What a stupendous machine is the human heart. When the reaction came, and Leoni's grief had worn itself out, she would have taken the dagger from the wall and plunged it into his heart. The insults offered to her father; the threats to herself; the privations and aggressions from which they had suffered, added to the misery of her present condition, maddened her. Overcome by fatigue and anxiety, she dropped into slumber. Dreaming of the battle field, a gay charger approached her; a youth sat upon his back, equipped as a bugler. On! on! came the tramp of many horses; bright steels glistened in the sunlight, and a deadly combat ensued. The waving of the proud banner of the Union and the cries of victory, told of success. As the youth turned, Leoni awoke with a wild start, and springing to her feet, rubbed her eyes, as if to see more clearly. She had beheld herself. 
               There had been fresh disturbances in the neighborhood, which Robinson forbore to speak of to Leoni, feeling that he could protect her with his own family-but the hour had already arrived. The Rebels were advancing upon them, and before nightfall of the day following the interment, every house which sheltered a Unionist had been pillaged and many laid waste. Leoni held a glass to her eye, and gazed far off on the scene of desolation. The mill was on fire,-its flames pierced the sky; a strolling party were stealing from it and advancing towards her cottage. With a palpitating heart she watched their course, as nearer they drew. Upon the roadside they built a fire, and upon its yellow flame cast many articles; what they might be, it was impossible to tell. Suddenly a fight seemed to take place among the men-knives glanced in the air, and shots were fired; two of the number fell. The railings were torn down, and everything was marked for destruction that came in their way. Leaving the murdered men lying in the road, the ruffians continued their march. 
               Leoni, with no protection near, shuddered at their approach. One of the party, more bold than the rest, walked erect and at the front; occasional cheering went up for their leader. Who this depraved individual was, the reader may wonder. At length the party rounded the base of the hill, upon whose sloping sides Leoni had hunted the game with her father she knew every path and every outlet. Her blood curdled in her veins-her brain reeled! Who did she see at their head? Frederick Brenton, leading a band of outlaws! On they came, nearer and nearer-until every lineament of their faces spoke their murderous designs. Bloated with liquor and infuriated by the sight of blood, the amount of crime which each could commit seemed the talisman to favor. 
               For the moment, astonishment and fright had taken possession of our heroine. Pale and motionless, she stood watching their approach, while the glass dropped from her hand: the reality of her situation, in all its terrible force, rushed to her mind. No time was to be lost. Fully aroused to the sense of her danger, she seized the dagger and placed it in her belt; then, drawing the pistol from its hiding place, she held it with a firm hand and brave intention. Exasperation and hatred towards Frederick Brenton, took away all her timidity, and Leoni's woman nature was gone. 
               Behind the cottage waved the tall corn, fruits of her father's toil; the young trees of the orchard were beginning to show, in their beautiful expansion, the labor that had been bestowed upon them. The old man had spent his leisure hours particularly in cultivating these two. The corn was smitten with swords and iron rods, and one by one the young trees were severed from the ground. Fences were laid low, and every thing told of desolation and plunder. 
               The party now stood within the gate, having overthrown the railings. Now came the time for action. 
               Springing to the window which overlooked the garden, Leoni held the weapon in the face of the miscreants, exclaiming, madly- 
               "Cowards! dare approach one step nearer, and you are dead." 
               With a bound and a yell, one of the foremost dashed on, and off went the pistol. 
               Leoni, true to her word, had shot the rebel in the heart. 
               Another and another, with curses, defied her, till three lay weltering in blood. 
               At the sight of this first deed, and the well-known voice of Frederick Brenton, crying, "On! on, boys! afraid of a damned woman?" the heart of the brave girl began to fail; the pistol trembled within her grasp, and the room faded from her view. She felt herself grasped by a powerful hand and dragged upon the green. The outlaws crowded upon her, and would have torn every thread of clothing from her body, had not Brenton, with other purposes in view, bade them desist and look for the old man. The wretches obeyed, but finding their search in vain, believed that Marcus was hiding, and complained loud and clamorously. Brenton, who seemed to have that command over them which ringleaders have over gangs, disregarded them, and remained with Leoni, whom he was beginning to regard as his property. 
                
               Partially reviving, she became aware of his presence, and springing from his embrace, though scarcely able to stand upon her feet, she reached for the dagger, expecting to find it in her belt, but it had been removed with the pistol. Pillaging was going on within the house, and cries for "the old man, the cursed white head," as they called him. 
               Casting upon the villain who tried to detain her, a look of scorn and defiance, she exclaimed, "Cowardly wretch, you have disarmed me, but I fear you not; low-born menials, you have desecrated my father's memory and trampled upon his ashes! Traitors to your country and humanity, none but dastardly cowards would have robbed me of my weapons!" 
               The rebels made no reply, but set up a fiendish laugh. 
               "Put the girl up for a stump speech," said one. 
               "To the highest bidder," roared another. 
               This was too much for Frederick; he wanted the prize; so he commanded them to keep their peace and get ready to leave. 
               "The girl can't help it," he said, turning upon his victim an assumed look of pity. 
               "How much will you take, Brenton, for your share of the spoils?" said a high-checked, raw-boned wretch,-and as he spoke, jerked Leoni rudely by the chin. 
               The color came and died away from her angry brow. 
               "Base wretch!" she exclaimed, "to insult a woman! Were I man, that I might strike you to the earth." 
               "Ha! ha! You're brave one as ever I saw," answered the ruffian. 
               "Come, enough, fellow," interposed Brenton. 
               "Where's your father?" turning and addressing Leoni in a peremptory tone. 
               "Dead!" she almost screamed. 
               "Dead?" exclaimed the horror stricken wretch, scarcely able to restrain his surprise, at the same time a gleam of malice flitted over his sun-burnt, swarthy face. 
               "Mine! mine! for sure," he said to himself, maddened by the sight of her wild beauty and helpless condition; then, too, the loss of her good opinion he somewhat regretted. His fury increasing, fire seemed to gleam from his eye-balls, and his breath grew heavy. 
               "Dead!" he again groaned, and as if a sudden thought possessed him, he called to the other ruffians that, "The old man was dead and that the girl could do no harm, as she was defenceless." 
               With curses and imprecations, they desisted, and dragging the bodies of the dead men after them, left. 
               Leoni found upon her arm a severe bruise, caused by the gripe of the ruffians-and overcome by excitement and Brenton's last threat, spoken in her ear alone-she watched them as they disappeared one by one behind the hill; she crawled to the windows and doors and fastened them securely. Making a great effort, she gathered a few articles which she thought would be useful to the Miller's wife. With the determination of carrying out her designs, it was necessary to procure a suit of male attire. She thought more and more of avenging her wrongs and the insults offered to her father. She now hated and loathed Frederick Brenton,-feared, yet dared him. 
               No time could be lost; she dreaded his return, and must seek a place of safety. The protection of Robinson was all that offered. Tall forms of flame and smoke were still ascending from the mill. Poor Robinson had been cruelly beaten, for raising the stars and stripes over the old mill, and his life's earnings destroyed. 
               What a sight to behold; crushed and beaten-the wife of his bosom suffering the agony of despair; the mill burning, and high in air, the flag of the Union still waving, amid wreaths of flame. 
               Leoni watched the fire until the evening grew into night; then, moving slowly out in the direction of the fire, with her few selected articles upon her arm, and protected by the thick darkness, she entered the narrow path which lead to her father's grave. With a beating heart and throbbing brain, she traced its course to that dear spot; she needed no candle to find it though the night was dark and heavy, for ever and anon the canflagration lit up the heavens above and cast a fitful luster over the mounds of the dead. 
               The scene filled Leoni's soul with horror,-creating strange, fantastic figures, and thoughts of the resurrection day and grave ascensions. It was indeed, a lonely spot, but Leoni had never known actual fear. A deep, hallowed enjoyment mingled with her sorrow; she felt that she was not alone-that the influence and protection of the being who had passed away, was around her; but she knew not, that at that very moment a pair of gleaming, mortal eyes were riveted upon her. 
               Springing from his ambush, Frederick Brenton clasped her in his arms. 
               As soon as Leoni could recover from her surprise, she exclaimed, struggling to fee herself,- 
               "Unhand me, villain! let me go." 
               "When you have promised me," he answered, holding her in his iron grasp,-and in her ear he breathed words of vile import. 
               Leoni's cheeks grew blanched; with a struggle she freed herself from his hold. 
               "Dastardly coward," she replied, "here, 'upon my father's grave, you insult me. Base wretch! Begone! I loathe,-despise you." 
                
               Taking fresh courage, Frederick seized her hand within his own, and retained it. 
               "Don't speak to me of that old reprobate father of yours! I owe half my trouble to him; if it had not been for him I'd had you long ago-but now I'm bound to have you. I'd a little rather have you by fair means,-but if I can't, why, then by foul. Say, then, proud girl, will you be mine? We have no time to loiter, I must be off, the cursed Yankees are upon us; it cost me some pains to pay you my compliments to-night. You thought to escape me, but I guessed your game." 
               Leoni's cheek and brow dyed crimson and faded white by turns; trembling at the thought of the possible fate that awaited her, if once in his power. 
               "Monster! let me go," she said, as he held her firmly. 
               Almost fainting from over-exertions, he attempted to drag her to the opening in the bushes. Loosening his hold for a second, as if to renew his strength, she sprang from him into the path, and by a dexterous movement was making rapid headway towards the outlet, when she heard his quick tread behind her; darting into the midst of a clump of low bushes, a little to the right, she was soon relieved by seeing the wretched man run at full speed over the very ground she had just left. 
               Supposing his victim had followed the path to its opening, he never ceased running until he reached that point. 
               As soon as Leoni could breathe more freely, she left her hiding place. Thankful that she had again escaped him, she clasped her hands fervently and strained back the torrent that was fast collecting. 
               "I will be strong," she exclaimed, "My father's memory shall not be disgraced," and falling upon her kneed, she cried with frantic energy, "I will! I will avenge thee!" Rising, she pursued the opposite path to the one taken by the traitor, and soon stood within the hovel which served as a temporary abode for the family of Robinson, their comfortable home having been in such close proximity to the mill, as to render impossible its preservation from the flames. Even the bed upon which they slept had been consumed. 
               The sight of this poor family, rendered desolate and houseless in a few hours, affected Leoni to tears, which she was trying hard to restrain. The distress of others had never passed by Leoni, without a tear of expression of sympathy. Her own sorrows, however great, did not render her insensible to those of Adele; while she had cherished for her a sisterly affection, she looked to her for protection and aid in her present adventure. Bent upon her resolve, the thought of failure had never mingled with her plans. Success was the word, and the more speedily her course was laid out, the better it would suit her.

               CHAPTER III. 
               Adele Robinson had been Leoni's best friend; her principles were strongly in favor of the Union, and she had freely expressed herself. She had escaped personal injury, though everything had been taken from her; and when the outlaws had commanded the young mill-owner to raise the ensign of rebellion, Adele bravely brought out the Red, White and Blue, which she had sewed together with her own fingers, Poor Robinson would have hesitated, had he known the consequences, but Adele would have died upon the stake. 
               Her great-grandfather had been a revolutionary soldier, and while yet a child, she seemed imbued with the feeling of patriotism and greatness. Her leisure hours had been employed mostly in reading descriptions of revolutionary battles, and when the rebellion broke out, her spirit for a time, seemed almost broken. 
               There was not an accident connected with its history, but what was familiar to Adele. 
               Robinson listened while she read aloud; she cheered him when he was defiant and encouraged him when faint-hearted. Adele was the better soldier of the two. Forced to speak his sentiments, or be branded "traitor," he chose the former, for his heart was in the right place. He came out more strongly than was expected, and was consequently considered one of the most daring among the Unionists. 
               It was the feelings of a warrior, then, that Adele proceeded to equip Leoni for her undertaking. She procured for her a suit of apparel which had been left by one of the mill-hands, who had been induced to join the rebel ranks. Adele knew the importance of secrecy, having heard Leoni's story, so they observed the strictest silence. Robinson, himself, being too ill to take any part in the transaction. 
               The bugle she had saved from the wreck, which, with the glass and a change of clothing, well washed and mended by Adele, was all she carried. 
               It was known that the strong forces of the Union army was near, and every heart beat high. 
               A night of rest under Adele's roof, did much towards restoring Leoni's composure and preparing her for action. Her courage failed not. As she glanced at her figure, clothed in male attire, the last words of her beloved father came rushing to her mind, bringing with them a thousand memories. 
               These thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of Adele, who came running up to say, that "Minister Brown was below, and had brought great news; that recruiting was going on briskly five miles away-and Reuben, his eldest son, was going over in the morning: 'What a splendid chance,'" said Adele, rather surprised to notice that the color forsook our heroine's face-but attributing it to the momentary shrinking, she continued, "It seemed to me to be the very thing." 
               Leoni thought so, too, but she could not speak. 
               Reuben Brown was a name Leoni never mentioned. Some strange mystery hung over that name. Was it, that he had crossed her path darkly, or had any misconduct of his caused a coldness between them? 
               We will see. 
               Two years since, Reuben Brown, a tall, finely formed youth of twenty summers, sought the hand of Leoni Loudon. The old man studied him well, and the maiden thought she loved him. She remembered how they had been friends together; how he had carried her basket and books home from school; where they had sat upon the same bench and learned the same line of spelling; when Leoni was "kept in," Reuben stayed at the door, to tell her "how sorry he was." If Leoni had two apples, one was for Reuben; and her hat was often loaded down with butter-cups and daisies. 
               At a later day, a tall, evil-minded youth, came to the school, as a great condescension, for his father was the owner of slaves, and he lived in the "big white house." This was no less a person than Frederick Brenton, whom we have proved to be a base villain. 
               Reuben saw with displeasure, Frederick's close attention to his favorite, and considered him a rival while yet a boy. When they met, Reuben's brow darkened and Frederick hummed a tune. At length matters became serious. Both asked the hand of Leoni. 
               Frederick was accepted, while Reuben was rejected. 
               The latter, pale and dejected, sought his home, never more to breathe that dear name. 
               The war broke out, and every man was required to express his sentiments. The man chosen by Leoni to be her protector and guide through life, turned traitor to his country, and prime leader of disloyal factions; while Reuben, reared by a good father to honor and uphold the government, remained true. 
               Leoni and her father now scorned the name of him they had so much loved; for the same cowardice which made him a traitor to his country, made him disrespect old Marcus and trifle with the daughter. He renewed newed his protestations, and was scorned. 'Twas then that Reuben Brown's good qualities came before Leoni. 'Twas then she felt that she had refused a brave and noble heart-but the deed was done: she should never cross his path, and he might forget her. After that conclusion she dismissed him from her mind. 
               It cannot seem strange, then, that this piece of information on the part of Adele, had puzzled Leoni a little, about what course was best to pursue. Not wishing Adele to observe her hesitation, she replied, after a few moment's thought,- 
               "I will go to-morrow and enlist,-the young man will not remember me, think you he will, Adele?" 
               "No! never. No one would suspect but that you are a clever young man, and a right good looking one, at that. I dare say that Reuben will like you for a companion, and that before long you will be sworn friends. Only keep your secret; the only way to do that, is to be firm, unflinching. Rely on me for a friend, and if anything befalls you, let me know; I will seek you out, if I can." 
               Saying this, Adele hurried below, to speak again to the Minister, and to tell him that a fine young man of her acquaintance would accompany Reuben to-morrow. 
               Mr. Brown was delighted, and lost no time in communicating the pleasing intelligence to his son. 
               Reuben was full of the spirit of adventure, and the prospect of having company so well spoken of, was highly gratifying. He slept well, and was ready by break of day to walk the five miles. He took no particular notice of his companion, at first, for he was sad at parting from his home, perhaps never to return. He thought, too, of Leoni, and as he passed over the hill, he turned to look at the cottage. 
               "Baldwin," said he, (the adopted name of our heroine,) "the rebels have done much damage round here; that cottage yonder, behind those trees, contains one of the finest girls in the country; she, had just buried her father, when all alone and unprotected, a band of ruffians entered and ransacked the house,-but perhaps you have heard of it from the Robinsons?" 
               "No," answered our heroine, endeavoring to school her voice, "I only arrived yesterday, and have not heard of it." 
               "I heard father say," continued Reuben, "that the brave girl stood her ground; I wish I'd been there," he sighed, "but I was away from home, and reached here after the mischief was done and the robbers had left." 
               "I'm told, the same party set fire to the mill, and also destroyed father's barn; I've made up my mind to kill a few of them before I return.' 
                
               This intention met with the approbation of Baldwin, who did credit to his new name and character,-and Reuben congratulated himself in finding so good a friend. 
               The more familiar they became, the memory of Reuben seemed sadly perplexed to trace out some connexion between Baldwin and the past, but without success, as he frequently turned upon him a long, inquiring gaze, which quite annoyed our heroine, making her feel very uneasy. 
               She knew that the deception in her appearance was complete, but feared that some awkwardness on her part might create suspicion. 
               For some time, they relapsed into silence,-each deeply engaged in imaginations concerning their new career. 
               Notwithstanding the very bold step Leoni had taken, she could not conquer the natural timidity of her woman's nature, nor throw aside that delicacy of feeling which shrinks from coarse intermingling with those of the other sex. 
               Reuben, sad and uncertain about his future, and possessing refinement of purpose and appreciation, regarded the silence of his companion as the result of emotions similar to his own. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               About noon they came in sight of the camp, with its dotted canopies, shaded by lofty trees; the ground was undulating, and a stream ran through the border. 
               When our friends reached the camp ground, a fresh number of recruits were about entering, and our heroine and her companion "fell in." The companies were nearly full, and preparations going on briskly for an attack. 
               Many of the men were sick; among the number was a bugler, who had become so enfeebled as to be considered unfit for duty. Our heroine made known her qualification, and at once became installed in the new and long desired position. A slight objection was made to his youth and delicate appearance, but these were passed over, as Baldwin declared, "That he was used to all weather and horses." 
               Reuben Brown was enrolled a private, but acted as Captain's clerk, the real clerk being ill with rheumatism. The men had slept upon the ground, and the rains had been heavy. 
               A fine, dark horse was given to Leoni; she wondered where she had seen him, until the dream came to her recollection,-now so plainly revealed. 
               The regiment consisted of a well-drilled body of men, under the command of the brave Col. Wallace. The third day from the instalment of our heroine, the men were drawn up, and the word of command given for the drill. Leoni sat upon her horse as fearlessly as any, and her riding had already attracted the attention of some of the officers, among whom was a young Lieutenant, named Rodney; a slim, dark man, of peculiar bearing; his eyes were full of meaning, and shaded with finely pencilled lashes; his demeanor was reserved; his men quick to obey, and indeed, a strange infatuation seemed to hold them; his voice was musical but not manly, and often heard in gay conversation with his fellow-officers. 
               Sometimes he stood aloof from his comrades, and at such times singled out our heroine,-who, for reasons of her own, always trembled at his familiar approach. Why Rodney sought her, she did not exactly understand-it seemed difficult to withdraw from him, without creating observation. If she retired to her tent, Rodney would follow. Why this pursuit, Leoni tried to fathom. 
               "I am tired of these fellows," he would sometimes say, when they were alone, "let us take a stroll." 
               Oft he sighed, and regretted that he had entered the army,-talk of his sister, and once Leoni saw a tear steal over his sun-burnt cheek. 
               "You speak like a woman," Leoni said on one occasion, and Rodney's brow grew scarlet. After that, his visits were less frequent. 
               The men danced at night-fall, to the music of Baldwin's bugle. 
               The Captain's clerk recovered and resumed his occupation, and Reuben Brown took his place in the ranks. 
               "Now came the tug of war;" the day of the engagement arrived. In battle array, the long rows of horses pranced upon the camp-ground, They were to meet the enemy face to face; drive them out, and plant the standard of liberty. Every man felt the importance of the occasion, and proud of their brave leader, each wished to distinguish himself. 
               With sabres glittering in the sunlight, and a dense cloud of dust, they moved on. Tramp, tramp, went the horses, as proud as their riders, seemingly imbued with the spirit of freedom. 
               Ten miles away, hidden by the treed and the broad side of a mountain, lay encamped a large body of rebels, headed by one of their best generals; to this party belonged Frederick Brenton and his murderous band. Fearless and lawless, they had ravaged the country round-stealthily by day and openly by night-committing depredations upon all whom they found defenceless. 
               Brave Captain Wesley, of Company D, had fallen in an encounter, having been overcome by some scouts; in consequence of which, Lieutenant Rodney took command of the men. Near him, rode our heroine, Leoni, appearing as brave as any on the field, though at times she felt a sinking at the heart. The bright steel and rows of soldiers, the cheering faces of the officers and the willingness of the men, soon restored her composure. 
               The location of the rebel camp had been precisely, ascertained, and the best mode of attack, but there was a slight delay in carrying out the orders. 
               The Rebels became apprised of the advance of the Union troops, and were preparing to leave. Heavy clouds came up-wind and rain filled the air, and almost complete darkness-though it was early after midday-rendered it almost impossible to distinguish objects but a little ahead. 
               Great consternation prevailed among the rebels when the Union cavalry were heard nearing the ground. Some of the rebels unable to sustain their position, fled in every direction, leaving their stores and ammunition. With those who remained, a bloody conflict ensued. 
               Now came the time for faint hearts to be brave. The resistance was well maintained for a considerable length of time. Men fell on both and all sides. As their mangled and bleeding forms fell beneath the horses' feet, and their dying groans and imprecations filled the air, the spectacle was terrific in the extreme; even the bravest and most hardy in the service sickened at the sight. 
               Our heroine felt faint and irresolute for a time, but self-possession soon returned, with the recollection of her grievances. 
               The enemy's strength was failing and our force gaining ground, when a hundred shots, at the same time, riddled our glorious banner; the bearer fell-another and yet another shared the same fate. The din of battle; the cries of the fallen, among whom lay three of our best officers; the increasing fury of the wind, and the fiery balls of the enemy, presented a scene truly awful. As the last man bravely seized the colors and bore them aloft, a shell burst, dashing horse, rider and flag to the ground. Foremost among the men, and near the scene of disaster, was brave Reuben Brown; his horse becoming unmanageable, he was for some time, in danger of being thrown; he had dashed on to recover the flag, but was prevented at that moment. Regaining command of the fiery beast he rode, he made an onset, took possession of the flag, triumphantly bearing it to the front, when a ball from the enemy struck him in the left arm. A start and cry of pain escaped him,-but dashing on he seized, the prostrate flag with his right arm, and bore it aloft, shivering to the breeze. 
               The command, "charge," came down the line, and at the same moment forward rushed men and horses. 
               The situation of our heroine was now perilous in the extreme. Brave soldiers were falling all around her; she would have fallen, the blood seemed to be leaving her veins; the bugle had fallen from her hand; but seizing her pistol and closing in, she beheld Reuben Brown's form weltering in blood; he was badly wounded, and turned a look of deadly hate upon his adversary. Leoni perceived with horror, that the wretch who had dragged from him his sabre and made the thrust, was no other than the traitor, Brenton. He had recognized Reuben. 
               All the fire of revenge, wrought up to the highest pitch by the sight of poor Reuben and the recollection of the past, filled Leoni's soul to madness,-and rushing on, she met face to face the well-known villain, who, making a dash at Leoni with his sword, made a slight wound in her shoulder; Leoni levelled her pistol instantly and aimed at Brenton a deadly shot; the sword fell from his grasp. Leoni had slain her own and her father's enemy. 
               Loss of blood and great exertion well-nigh overcame our heroine. 
               Lieutenant Rodney, who had stood the enemy's fire and kept command of his men, gave the order to retire; the rebels had given way, leaving us the ground and stores. It was indeed a fearful sight,-the piles of dead men, fathers and sons. 
               Among the badly wounded, was counted Reuben Brown. Leoni's wound bled profusely. The conflict was over, and with it died away the wind. The wounded were cared for,-and many hearts that had beat warmly with patriotism at the opening of the battle, now lay silent in the arms of death. 
               Morning shone bright and clear upon the battle field, while the soft grass was disturbed to make dwellings for the dead. 
               Leoni was glad to leave the sickening sight; her wound obliged her to keep still, during which time Lieutenant Rodney was very kind to her; he had passed through unhurt. Every scene in the engagement was talked over; the men crowded round him, giving cheer after cheer for brave Lieutenant Rodney. 
               Reuben was mending, though slowly; he considered the bugler his preserver, for he had witnessed the despatch of Brenton, though apparently unconscious. 
               Leoni had won a character for bravery, and was promoted to act as Lieutenant, while Rodney took the position of Captain, the other Lien tenants and Sergeants having fallen. This pleased our heroine much, as it enabled her to be much with Rodney, for whom she had contracted a strong friendship. 
               A singular reserve was always manifested between these two officers, which neither understood, yet both felt. 
               Rodney had examined the wound upon Leoni's shoulder, when excessive pain had made her almost insensible. One day, when the wound was nearly healed, while she was within her tent, Captain Rodney entered unceremoniously, as Leoni thought, aid approaching, offered to draw her towards himself, making use of some familiar phrase at the time. Much surprised at this conduct, Leoni felt alarmed. 
               "Can it be," she asked herself, "that he suspects me? Now I think of it, he has always regarded me with suspicion; what can it mean?" 
               While this harrowing suspense filled the mind of the girl, Rodney was working his eyes with a most malicious grin and feeding on Leoni's anxiety. 
               "Come! come, you know you're a woman!" said the Captain, springing towards Leoni and embracing her, "Give me one of those kisses from those ruby lips, I saw you give to that fellow whose life you saved." 
               Stunned, as if a thunder-bolt had fallen at her feet, and riveted to the spot, stood our heroine, scarlet from head to foot. 
               "What shall be done?" was the question she revolved in her own mind, after extricating herself from him. "So he suspects! What shall I do?" 
               Turning upon Rodney a beseeching look, she exclaimed,- 
               "Spare me! Oh, spare me! If you know my secret, I am undone." 
               Trembling in every limb, she would have fallen, had not Rodney's arm encircled her waist. 
               Almost powerless, with lips and brow blanched, she struggled to free herself, and maintain her self-possession. 
               Rodney released her, really seeming delighted with the discovery. Regarding her with a look of tender interest, he replied, earnestly,- 
               "Fear not; in my hands you are safe, rely on that," saying these words, he sprang outside the tent, and was gone. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER V. 
               At this discovery Leoni's agony of mind can better be imagined than described. She wondered how she should escape the power of Captain Rodney, a man for whom she felt the strongest attachment, and one who had professed for her the liveliest interest, believing him to be a fellow-soldier. What should she do were Reuben Brown to find oat the secret? They had passed many days and nights together, Reuben had freely conversed about the story of his wrongs,-of his past and blighted future. In the sympathizing ear of the supposed Baldwin, he had confided the deep and never dying love for Leoni Louden, a wild fearless girl, who had taken her love from him and bestowed it upon a wretch named Brenton; that wretch had been slain by the hand of Baldwin; Leoni did not show any emotion, though the story pained her. Reuben thought he would not survive his injuries, and wished Leoni to be the bearer of messages to his father. One he sent to Leoni, of his devotion to the last. 
               Composure fled from our heroine from this time forth. She revolved many plans in her mind, concerning her course of action. 
               Could she trust Rodney? How should she act towards Reuben under the scrutinizing eye of the other? These thoughts were, almost maddening her. Should she resign? She would try. These, and other questions, arose to her mind, and when well-nigh worn out, wondering what to do to prevent exposure to the regiment, she was startled by the still more abrupt entrance of the Captain. 
               During his absence night had stolen over the camp. Leoni had not even heard the roll called, so absorbed had she been in her own thoughts. 
               "Well!" said the Captain, observing the marked reserve and displeasure of Leoni, added to extreme caution, "Lieutenant, I hope you are not displeased, I have come in to have a chat with you; a fellow gets lonely associating all the time with those brawling loafers,-I long for a little bit of domestic life. Come, treat a fellow sociably, and may-be I'll pass the night with you." 
               Leoni trembled violently, and Rodney turned aside his face, to hide the smerk he could not restrain. 
                
               A silence ensued; each sat watching the other, over the camp fire. 
               "Did not Reuben Brown owe his life to her?" Leoni asked herself. His was a heart full of gratitude; should she not tell him all, and rely on his generosity; his tent was quite near. But, again, how could she go about telling him? He might despise her. 
               These and other thoughts were suggested to her mind, but she could decide upon nothing. She felt that she could not stand it much longer. 
               Rodney, buried in his own thoughts, had fallen into a profound reverie, until the night had almost verged into day. Springing up, and yawning repeatedly, he said,- 
               "Come, Lieutenant, let's go to bed; your wound is far from well, and you need rest." When he had finished, he threw himself upon the rough bed, where he lay, with one eye open, watching Leoni,-who, thinking herself unobserved, indulged in grief and bitter reflections. 
               "Come! boy," exclaimed Rodney, as if suddenly awakening, "What ails you?" 
               "Cruel, cruel Captain! I thought you had some feeling," answered Leoni, "Can you not respect a sorrow like mine?" 
               "I not only respect you," replied Rodney, "but I adore you." 
               "Would that it were day," said Leoni. 
               Rodney made a start, drew several quick breaths, and complained of suffocation. Still Leoni moved not. 
               "Will you open my vest," asked the Captain, speaking with difficulty, as though attacked with sudden oppression. 
               Leoni advanced, and complied with his request. Rodney breathed more freely, and so did Leoni; she had made a discovery. A strange conviction had flushed across her mind at the sight of that snowy, heaving bosom and the delicately curved neck. The peculiar manner which accompanied Rodney's request, had struck Leoni. She gazed speechless, incapable of expressing her astonishment, much to the amusement of the Captain, who possessed a keen sense the ludicrous. 
               "Forgive me now, will you, Lieutenant?" said he, and observing Leoni's emotion, he added, "we have the same secret. I could not forbear having a little sport at your expense." 
               Leoni replied not; bewildered and amazed, the scenes through which they had passed came rushing to her mind. 
               "Can it then be possible?" she at length exclaimed, growing more calm. 
               "Did you never suspect me, Lieutenant?" 
                
               "Never for a moment, did I harbor the thought, you sustained the character too well." 
               "The time when you upbraided me for being home-sick, you said I spoke like a woman." 
               "Yes, I did," replied Leoni, "but I said that to defend myself; I was timid and fearful, lest you might grow suspicious of me; pray, how long have you known my secret?" 
               "For several days, since I saw you wound. When you fell upon your shoulder and started it to bleeding afresh, the pain was so excessive that you were unconscious for several moments; I was near, and carried you to the bank, gave you some water and examined the wound; I was so much astonished, that I allowed the water to fall from my hand, which falling over your face, brought you to realize you situation.' 
               "Is it possible?" uttered Leoni, "and you said nothing?" 
               "No! I have waited since for this opportunity, but really did not intend to alarm you so." 
               "It is all forgiven," replied our heroine. 
               When morning came, Leoni's dark head lay nestled upon Rodney's bosom, where sleep had overtaken both. Dreams of a little white cottage, with beauty without and contentment within, haunted her. The ranks of the army were passing away, and green fields springing up in their place. A shadow went in and out by her side, associating with her pleasant toils. Who this was, she could not find out, as he turned his face from her, but when she awoke she thought it was Reuben Brown. 
               Rodney lost no time in communicating her history to Leoni; it was an eventful one, and I will give it to the reader, as nearly as possible, in her own language. 
               "My name is Miriam Reynolds; I was born," said she, "in Kansas, our home was in a dense wood, remote from any dwelling, the house having been built by my father himself, after many years of struggling. My mother, born and bred in the country, milked the cow, on the green, and my two younger brothers drove home the sheep, while it was my portion to attend to the poultry, of which we had a considerable number. If a stray foot stole over the premises by night, or a disturbance of any kind occurred, I was called to search out the miscreant, or surprise the invader. No one was afraid when I was at home, for I never knew what fear meant; protection fell to my lot, and I was looked up to as a superior being, by my parents and brothers; I loved them as dearly as they loved me, and home was a dear place to all of us. Judge, then, of the break in our family, when after a month of terrible illness, our mother was carried from the house and laid beneath the tall willow at the bottom of the garden. From that day I became a mother to my brothers, and the main dependence of my father, whose grief at her loss never abated. Morning found his pillow wet with weeping, and night after night he would recount to me the dealings of the past, in all which my mother was associated. 
               "As my father's health declined, my too elder brothers took entire charge of the farm, which had increased considerably by my father's industry; instead of the ten tiny sheep which had been given to us for pets, our fold numbered by hundreds, and our cattle covered the pasture. 
               "James was a good and brave youth,-he conveyed the produce to the town-market, and at night counted his earnings. One dark, bleak night I sat up awaiting his return later that usual, wondering what detained him and making excuses to my father for not going to bed, as I did not wish him to know that James was not at home; a terrible apprehension of evil came over me, and I listened eagerly for every sound that might tell of his approach. Alas! morning came, the early grey light shone in upon me as I still sat in the chair, where I had fallen asleep. A tap upon my shoulder awakened me to the full consciousness of my situation; James stood beside me, but his face was whitened and a stream of blood ran down his garment; he pointed to his neck, but spoke not. In the first instant of surprise, I gazed at this countenance, and seeing that some awful accident had befallen him, exclaimed, springing from my seat,- 
               "'Dear James, what has happened, what has kept you so long?' I attempted to take hold of him, with the intention of placing him in my chair, when, do not start Leoni, he had vanished! 'Was it a dream?' I asked myself. 
               "The changed face, again appeared before me, and I felt assured that it was the spirit of my brother, and that he himself, was no more. I beseeched him to relate to me the manner of his death, but in vain, for I was again alone. I saw before the house the well-known produce wagon, which he had taken away in the morning; so, bracing my nerves I moved to the road and walked straight up to the vehicle; a dark mass of human matter lay tangled in a heap, and every appertenance of the wagon was gone; the horse had evidently brought him home, after he had been cruelly murdered and cast within. 
               "My horror can better be imagined that described at this discovery-the recollection of it is engraved upon my soul. I aroused my father, who in his agony of despair, tore from the wagon the mutilated remains of our beloved James, as self-sacrificing and noble a led as ever lived. The perpetrators of that dark deed was never discovered. We buried his mangled corpse beside our mother; but a change had taken place within our home,-my father's health became rapidly worse, and the entire care of the farm fell upon the boys. About this time, Alfred took a fancy to go abroad to seek his fortune; and my father allowed him to depart after giving him much good advice and a well filled purse." 
               At this juncture in her story, Rodney displayed much agitation, pausing for a time to regain the mastery of her feelings. 
               "Now, I come," she continued, "to the relation of facts too brutal for the pen of the historian. To those cruel events which led me to my present life, and changed the course of the very blood that flows in my veins. 
               "We had retired to rest, with no apprehension of dangers, on that fatal night. Living remote from our neighbours, and perfectly absorbed in our daily pursuits, we had no chance of hearing gossip or news. The war had not visited us, but in report. Towards morning the feeble voice of my poor father, calling for mercy and help, struck upon my ear as I lay in an upper room. I sprang below, forcing open a door which led to my father's apartment and against which some ruffians were leaning. My God! What horrors to relate. On the floor weltering in his blood, I beheld my beloved parent whom I would have died to save. As I reached the spot, a blackened wretch had dealt the blow which had extinguished life. 'Who has dared? Who has done this foul deed?' I cried, and in my agony and fright, I fell upon the lifeless remains of my parent. 
               "The wretches beholding the dead man and hearing the voices of my brothers, who had been aroused by the noise, sprang in the direction from whence the sound issued, and before I had time to collect my scattered senses, one of my brothers was dragged into the room by the hair of his head, which had flowed to his shoulders in golden curls,-our baby brother; never shall I forget the look of anguish which he cast upon me, as he perceived that I was unable to render him any assistance; he was kicked and strangled before my eyes and thrown upon the body of my father, where their blood flowed together. 
               "You will ask, Leoni, what I was doing all this time; well, I will tell you: The sound of guns and the general confusion without, had assured me of the true state of affairs. My father had no several occasions offered protection to the runaway when hunted down by his master: or given his mite to assist him on his journey, with a heart-felt 'God speed you,' which we all felt; I remembered these acts, and how my father had been censured for his anti-slavery principles. 
               "'Kill the d--d abolitionists,' the men constantly repeated, while engaged in their bloody work; 'Finish them! Annihilate them!' and like expressions. 
                
               "I had looked in vain for some weapon to use, in case they attacked me-to assist my brothers was impossible-one of the blood-thirsty wretches guarded the corner where I stood, with a heavy billet of wood, which he flourished at times, by way of a threat, over my head. My only surviving brother was the next victim; after binding him hand and foot outside of the door, and inflicting several blows upon his head, rendering him insensible, they searched every nook and corner of the house-gathering every article of value, and complaining loudly that they had been deceived about the amount of money concealed. I was dragged along with the men, for my feet never touched the floor, and made to produce the keys of the chest which contained my father's valuables, including some sacred relics of my mother; these were thrown about in wild confusion or distributed among the demons. They numbered about twenty, and as our house stood some distance from the road, our situation was perilous in the extreme. Why they did not kill me, I cannot tell. I did not ask for mercy, or implore my life, but defied them in every way. 
               "I was overcome with agitation at seeing them depart, apparently regardless of Bertrand, who remained bound at the door. I crept up to him as best I could with my paralyzed limbs, to loosen the cord, when I discovered that he, too, was dead: the rope had been tied round his neck as well as his body, and life had been extinct sometime. This last stroke was too much for nature to bear, and I felt that consciousness was forsaking me. 
               "How long I remained in that condition I am unable to say, when I did recover my senses, I was blinded by smoke and flame, which were stealing towards me from every opening in the house. The murderers had set fire to some light wood in the kitchen, and the element was doing its work. I peered into the nearest window and beheld everthing within the room enveloped in flames. 
               "What to do I knew not; where to look for help I knew not. To remain and witness the mangled bodies of those loved ones devoured by raging fire, was too horrible to think of. Sounds of injury and violence were borne on the air, and reports of musketry heard in the distance, which told that others were suffering and crying for protection. With my feeble strength, I reached the room where my father and brother lay,-after cutting one of the beautiful curls, I threw a covering over them, and was forced to leave; I then untied my dear Bertrand, and mustering all my strength, dragged his body some distance from the house, where at least, the flames would not reach it. I determined, if possible, to go into the town, about half a mile distant, and seek for aid. My condition was such that I feared I should die, before finding some
                   
                   
                     SPRINGING TO THE WINDOW LEONI HELD THE WEAPON IN THE FACE OF THE MISCREANTS. EXCLAIMING. 
                  
                   one to whom I could relate the awful tragedy. I started-from tree to tree I groped, turning at intervals to take a last look at all that had been to me so dear; I stumbled over the grave of my mother, beneath the willow, and could go no further. I afterwards ascertained that I had been picked up towards morning, and carried to a farm house, by some good Samaritan and well cared for; a short illness followed, during which time I remembered very little of what had taken place previously: when sufficiently restored to health, I was informed of these facts-that I had been ill three months; that my father and brothers had been decently buried beside the other graves; that it was all the work of the guerrillas, and that all had suffered by them; many houses had been sacked and burned and the inmates murdered. 
               "The kind old woman who have me this information, had nursed me well through my sickness; she mingled her tears with mine, as we stood beside the ground which contained all I had loved. The cottage stood a mass of blackened ruins, which I dared not enter. Indeed, I had no disposition to approach nearer a spot where such harrowing seenes had been enacted. 
               "My brother Alfred, returned; 'twas evening, I could not see his features, but as I tremblingly stood within his affectionate embrace, he told me in a hoarse whisper, that he knew all; my heart was relieved I felt that I would rather die than tell him. 
               "Before daybreak he had fled; a wild scrawl lay upon his table, directed to me; I hastily tore it open, and found that he had departed to seek revenge,-to avenge the murder of his family. While reading it, a fierce determination seized me. What that was, my friend, you can guess. Time and skill was necessary to effect my plain; there was great difficulty in procuring a horse, as all had been stolen by the guerrillas. At length every obstacle was overcome; the first horse I rode proved to be a very old one, that had been stolen and afterwards turned adrift,-the owner finding him, kindly gave him to me, supposing that I wished to visit some relations at a distance. I have suffered every kind of privation on my journey, and had no one to sympathize with me until I met you, Leoni." 
               Here Rodney's story ended. 
               Leoni felt deeply for her sufferings, and regarded her as a perfect wonder. The trials through which she had passed; the amount of courage she had displayed, and her undaunted perseverance, made her character a study. Bereft of all she had held dear, she had traveled day and night, until she had reached the Union forces. Possessing great activity of body and mind, combined with firmness of purpose, she had won her way from a Corporal to the position of Lieutenant, and from that to Captain. She had stood amidst fire, blows and thrusts, and passed without a scratch. Though gay at times, she was often depressed and sorrowful, as we have seen. She hated the association with the men as much as Leoni did, but delighted in epaulettes and military distinctions; in an encounter she had seemed invulnerable, and every rebel that had fallen by her hand, counted so many for each dear brother. Why she had been attracted towards Leoni, she could not tell, only that a suspicion had haunted her from the first, that she was a woman like herself. She had on several occasions tried to draw the truth from Leoni; the rebuke she received made her more cautious, though not less certain in her own mind. 
               This narrative had interested our heroine deeply; she could now account for many points in the character of Rodney. Leoni in return, gave the particulars of her own life, with which the reader is already acquainted. 
               In its relation, she did not omit the part enacted by Reuben Brown and the villain, Brenton, much to the astonishment of Rodney, whose feeling of protection more that ever increased towards Leoni. Their lives had been somewhat similar; cruelty had driven both to the false position they now held. It was no wonder then, that the strongest sympathy existed between them. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               Poor Reuben was disabled, and likely to be so for life,-short had been his career, but eventful. 
               The camp remained quiet for some time, with the exception of sending out scouting parties; the rebels worked in an underhand way, and did much mischief in their concealments. 
               Rodney and Leoni became sworn friends, and both spent much time with Reuben; a conversation occurred in the presence of the two, in which Reuben declared, "That he had placed his affections upon a maiden he had known from childhood, who had cruelly wronged him,-that to hide the grief he could not smother, he had sought the army at the earliest opportunity; at a later date, the rebels had ill-treated his father, and destroyed their property. With the double motive of seeking forgetfulness and doing his duty to his country, he had become a soldier. Indifference to life had stolen over him, almost crushing out the ambition and energy, which had belonged to him in a greater measure than is generally found in young men of his age. 
               Old Mr. Brown did not know the particulars of his son's case, or he would have inquired into it; he only knew that a passing attachment had sprung up between them, and supposed it had died a natural death, as it had been a most natural occurrence, that two high-spirited beings thrown together in youth, should love each other. He reasoned with upon their minds. 
               But such was not the case with his son; a sentiment once imbibed by him was never fairly eradicated. 
               The encounter with his rival, Brenton, was sudden and unexpected; the timely aid of Leoni, in his own wonderful preservation, had endeared to him our heroine. He loved to retrace the events of the past, though they filled his soul with horror. 
               Leoni always suffered at these recitals, and often abruptly departed, leaving Rodney alone with Reuben. 
               All were kind to Reuben Brown; he was one who by nature commanded respect from his fellow-soldiers and sympathy from his superiors, consequently he was not much alone. His bravery had won for him the esteem of all. 
               After much delay, a discharge was procured for him, and he was borne home in care of his father. 
               Let us look into the home of Reuben Brown; Hidden by the rich foliage of spreading trees, it stood embedded in shrubbery; behind and on all sides, lay fields of ripening corn and waving wheat, bending their heads in reverence, first to their Creator and then to the upright owner of the land, who dwelt upon it, and was called "good Minister Brown," for his charitable actions were known all over the neighborhood, and his weekly admonitions held sacred for each family guide; Minster Brown practiced as well as preached. 
               A little to the right stands the old white church, covered with clinging ivy, whose humble spire peeps out through those venerable trees; as the last rays of the departing sun falls upon the scene, no one could held pronouncing it a fairy one. To glide around those consecrated walls, in the cool of the day, or to repose within sound of the troubled spirit forget its wrongs for a passing hour, wandering amid the grassy mounds of those long since passed away, or searching for the fresh made grave of the friend more lately departed. 
               When on Sabbath morn the solemn tones of the bell fall upon the car of the worshipper, bidding him "Come and worship," they hasten not in crowds as they were wont to do, but one by one they hopelessly take their seats, for "the hand of death has been there." Instead of the happy faces of old and the elastic step, comes the sorrowful mourner with a slow, uncertain tread; scarce a family among them who has not felt the cruel hand of war among its dear one. The full, round, whole-soul music has subsided into the faint combination of an appointed few, who constitute the leaders. Heads droop and hearts weap,-a son and husband have just been laid away until the last waking, and the widow, wrapped in her mourning attire, sits apart with her child, striving for consolation in the words which are falling from the lips of the good man, for it is the Sabbath. 
               He thinks of his own Reuben while he prays for the absent, and treads with him the battle field, while he dwells upon its horrors. While picturing with rapture the soldier's return to his home, he clasps in fond imagination, his much loved son, his dutiful Reuben; the stranger wonders at the feeling he displays, and goes away comforted. 
               The church again empty, the pious man descends from the little pulpit, and takes a walk among the graves; beside the mound beneath which reposes the wife of his youth, his long lost Mary, whose simple first name is engraved upon the tomb, he pauses, while a tear bedims his eye; already his locks are whitened with the frost of years, and he longs to be at rest; "Reuben, my son," he cries, "thou too, hast been torn from me, to fight thy country's battles; oh! may'st thou be spared to my old age, I cannot lose thee, too." Sadly turning from the grave, Mr. Brown returns to his quiet home. 
               It has always been his delight to seek the dwellings of the poor and afflicted, to alleviate distress and distribute his mite. 
               Among those of his little flock who needed his comfort and advice, was our friend, Adele Robinson; although not believing exactly in the religious teachings of the day, or rather in the manner of serving it out, she loved to hear Mr. Brown converse; his words were something sounds, inspiring consolation for the past and hope for the future; the turbulent spirit could retire from the boisterous swelling ocean, to the serene shore of the pebbly stream; mighty vessels anchord in the deep, would slowly ride away, leaving the stream clear and unruffled. 
               Such a man was Mr. Brown, the father of Reuben. No wonder, then, that the son possessed the elements of a noble character. 
                
               After the events before described, had taken place with Reuben, Mr. Brown conversed with Adele, of his intention to remove his son from camp if possible, and the kind-hearted woman stood ready to aid in any way that might be in her power, for this purpose. 
               The minister bent his steps towards he dwelling on the afternoon of the sabbath. The kind welcome and the comfortable seat in the old arm-chair, had before now kindled a kind emotion in the heart of the lonely man, and on this occasion did much towards alleviating his sorrow. 
               "I shall start to-morrow," said he, "for camp, and shall bring poor Reuben home with me." 
               "I was wondering," he continued, "who I could get to nurse him and see to the house; do you know of any one?" 
               Adele thought a moment, and came to the conclusion that she did not. 
               "What has become of old Loudon's daughter?" asked Mr. Brown; "I have been thinking of her,-she used to think a great deal of Reuben, you remember, don't you?" 
               Adele's color forsook her cheek, as she thought of the part she had taken in what was considered Leoni's sudden disappearance, and replied,- 
               "That some time ago she had heard that the girl had contemplated a visit to an aunt a few miles distant, and she might have gone there." 
               Mr. Brown, feeling at home and resting after the labor of the day, fell into a reverie, while Adele busied herself about her house. If the Minister spoke, her answer was ready, but she held him in too much respect to intrude upon his meditation. 
               After partaking of a cup of tea, and thanking Adele for her courtesy, Mr. Brown took his way towards home. 
               At the close of another week, Reuben Brown lay upon his own bed, in his father's house; beside him stood a small table, upon which were some delicacies, that had been prepared by the hand of Adele, who sat near. Days and nights had been passed in attendance upon the invalid, until her presence was considered indispensable. 
               Sad hearts had parted with Reuben, and as sad ones had welcomed him home. 
               Adele sought an opportunity to inquire after young Baldwin, when Mr. Brown was absent. Reuben gave satisfactory information of all that had transpired since he left, to which Adele listened with more than ordinary interest, hoping to ascertain more than she could ask, concerning Baldwin, to whom she perceived Reuben entertained a most remarkable attachment. 
               Of her own circumstances she had much to relate, for Reuben had always respected Mr. Robinson. That poor man had paid the forfeit of his exposure and injuries, and had slept some time beneath the sod. Adele mourns his loss as those who mourn for the good and true. With her two children, and the small property, the gift of her father, she had removed a short distance from her former home, the spot where she had suffered so much. 
               She had married the man of her choice, and lived with him a short but eventful life. 
               Many hours she had spent in thinking of our heroine, away on a battle field, a helpless, shrinking girl,-clothed in a false attire, and surrounded by danger. Could she have seen Leoni, gladly would she have dissuaded her from pursuing further so unmaidenly a part, She refrained from exciting, by her remarks, any suspicions, as it had been a wonder throughout the neighborhood "what had become of Leoni London; some questioned "whether she had not met an untimely death by the hands of ruffians, on that disastrous night of plunder and murder;" while others said she had fled to a distant part of the country. Some, more curious, had even searched the grounds and stream, expecting to discover the place where her mangled remains had been thrown. After the nine day's wonder, all had been apparently forgotten. 
               Such is human nature, and such is life. 
               Let us return to camp. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VII. 
               One night Rodney was sad and dejected; in a fearful dream she had beheld her father and three brothers, clothed in the habiliments of the dead. On the came; when quite near, the foremost, her best beloved and youngest of the three, said,- 
               "We have come for you, sister; you have done bravely,-you have avenged us well and your time has expired;" then slowly retreating, they were lost from view behind a mountain covered with rebel soldiers, in the front Rodney distinguished her own bleeding form. 
                
                
               
                   
                     "STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM, LEONI, ONE OF OUR MEN BORE A STRIKING RESEMBLACE TO YOU! 
                  
                
                
               "I shall soon fall," she said to Leoni, after relating the dream: "If you should ever meet my brother Alfred, you will know him by his resemblance to me, only his eyes are the blackest I ever saw; on his left hand he wears a heavy gold ring, upon which is inscribed, 'To Alfred Reynolds, from his sister;' he is tall and straight, and about twenty-two years of age. Tell him how fondly I have remembered him,-how ardently I have longed to meet him. Tell him that I remember how our tears flowed together, and that my heart gave echo to the curse he breathe." 
               "I mourned his absence, and not until I had made the leafy alcoves of the forest resound with his dear name, did I give him up. The last tie broken, I resolved to do my part. Tell him my story, and my last hope, that he will avenge my fall, as I have my brothers." 
               "I feel that my hour has arrived, and that I shall soon leave you." 
               Leoin's grief knew no bounds at these sad tidings and their import. 
               Some days passed after this conversation. Poor Rodney seemed resigned and patiently awaiting her fate; like one acting under a settled conviction of impending danger, her mind was made up to meet bravely the worst. 
               One by one the little articles of the past, which Rodney had exhibited to Leoni, were disposed of. 
               The color forsook Rodney's cheek and her laugh was forced. After she had given Leoni her full confidence, she subsided into quietness, speaking seldom,-and when she did, the topic was the all engrossing one. 
               "I fear I tire you," she exclaimed to Leoni, as they walked along, "but my days are shortening; do you think you will miss me?" 
               Leoni would have answered, had not tears choked her utterance. 
               "Then you believe in dreams?" she said at length. 
               "Yes! when they are so extraordinary," replied Rodney. 
               "Look with me upon you sky; well, as sure as that sun is sinking in the west, I shall see the fulfillment of my dream before the week is cut." 
               These words were pronounced with so much energy, that Leoni was painfully agitated. 
               "Oh! do not give up to the vision," said she, "it will destroy you; I have sometimes been a victim to such fancies." 
               Leoni shuddered as she remembered the vision she had had of her own future life. 
               She wished if possible, to draw Rodney's mind from the terrible belief which she so strongly entertained. 
               "It is no use talking to me in that strain, Leoni," replied Rodney, with a decision which marked each word; "when an idea takes possession of me, I am unchangeable; my path has been laid out, and I shall see the dream realized. Promise me, that when I am gone you will forsake this mode of life,-it is unfit for you; I have long thought so. You must seek those you love, and fill the station which nature appointed you to. You are younger than I, and less fitted for the character you bear: sustain it no longer, but seek happiness. One heart is wearing away its life for you, on a sick bed,-a good, noble fellow; you can trust him. Many a time has he told me his love for you. Do not a mystery to me how you could treat him so cruelly." 
               Leoni, much astonished at these words, felt more certain than ever that some change was about to take place. 
               Rodney's tone and words were altered; she appeared strange,-never before had such sentiments been expressed. Rodney had ever set her face against marriage, and had never conversed on the subject of the affections. 
               But she was now speaking for another; she was studying the welfare of one from whom she expected shortly to be separated. 
               "And is it true that you would advise me to marry?" she asked. 
               "By all that is sacred," replied Rodney. 
               "I would advise you, as you have found and proven one true heart, to make it you own; cherish and honor it. Such love is seldom met as that which is yours. He mourns you as one dead; return to life and love: Throw off that detestable disguise,-I am tired and sick of it. The Lord knows what is best for me, for I am unfit for any life but the one I now lead." 
               She spoke with zeal. 
               As she gazed far in the distance, she seemed as if trying to penetrate something that was withheld from her, and frequently passed her hand across her eyes, as if to remove a cloud or barrier,- 
               "Not yet! not yet," she exclaimed, with sudden alarm. 
               "What is the matter?" asked Leoni, in terror; "did you see anything?" 
               "Ask me not, it was only a phantom," she replied, "I was even when a child, subject to these 'spells,' as they called them. 
               "Some kind of a feeling creeps over me when I am with you, that I cannot understand. At such times I seem to see things in their true light, and horrible pictures are presented, which make me wish to close my eyes to keep out the sight, but when I do, I see them more clearly. Think no more of it, Leoni, it has gone." 
                
               These remarks produced an unconquerable emotion in our heroine, much answering to this description. She acknowledged the truth of Rodney's assertion, and replied with earnestness,- 
               "I know you and believe I understand you. You have not been with me all this time without knowing that I have not become insensible to the feelings inherent in woman's nature. I have no desire to pursue, without you, a life like the present. In you my courage redoubled,-I felt like a man who had one friend he could trust. 
               "Long ago I rejected all thoughts of marriage; sorrows and disappointments have fallen to us both. I confess, when the knowledge was forced upon me of Reuben Brown's love, I was uncertain of the future; I felt that I had wronged him, and resolved to remain undiscovered. I have watched over him and sympathized with him, when he poured out the story of his heart, and persuaded him earnestly that it was best to cast her from his thoughts forever. He has turned and looked at me, and observed, 'how strangely you resemble her.' 
               "Judge, Rodney, whether I have played my part well, when I own to you that my feelings at times have almost carried me into a confession of the deception." 
               "You did indeed well. Terrible would have been an exposure; the scene will change soon, and you will resume you woman's character, believe me." 
               There was a brief silence: Their clasped hands trembled. Each seemed resolved on silence. 
               A soft smile played over Leoni's flushed face, as one by one, objections arose to her mind and disappeared. 
               Rodney's thoughts were on other things, not of this world. She was lost in thought. 
               Twice Leoni spoke, but Rodney heard not; sadly she withdrew her hand, and aroused Rodney from the apparent lethargy into which she had fallen. 
               Affairs within camp went on as usual for two or three days, at the end of the which period a scouting party was sent out. It was agreed that Captain Rodney should command them; forty in number, picked men. Our heroine was also ordered to lead a smaller party in another direction. 
               At parting, the friends clasped hands, but neither have utterance to the dreadful forebodings within them. The throbbing of Leoni's heart, as she struggled to speak, and the mournful, earnest, last look of Rodney, filled each with apprehension. 
               A sealed package was found by Leoni, within the tent, directed to Alfred Reynolds, and left to her care, to be delivered to him in case anything happened to Rodney. At this discovery, Leoni's heart was filled with sadness, knowing as she did, the feeling that had prompted the action. 
               She placed the package under lock and key, and was soon with the men, on the track of a band of stealthy rebels. The men who followed our heroine were firm, with desperate intentions. 
               Leoni's party and Rodney's took opposite directions, intending to intercept a small force of the enemy who were advancing upon our pickets. 
               At the terminus of two roads in a dense wood, they met, our men closing in upon both outlets. Firing commenced and was kept up for several minutes, when it was ascertained that the enemy redoubled our numbers. Some of our best men had fallen at the first fire; when the rest, who were fighting with renewed courage, saw the enemy's men stealing our from behind every bush and tree; there was no use continuing warfare against such odds. The rebels seeing their advantage, surrounded and took some prisoners, but most of the men escaped. 
               Among the captured was our heroine, who was mounted behind a rebel officer. With a desperate effort and slight of hand, Leoni took advantage of the stumbling of the rebel's horse, and seizing the revolver from the belt of the officer, she fired it into his ear and had the revolver from the belt of the officer, she fired it into his ear and had the satisfaction of seeing him roll headlong to the ground; catching the reins and spurring the animal in another direction, she fired at two of her pursuers and cleared the ground, the main body of rebels having gone in pursuit of our men. 
               Exhausted and covered with blood, our heroine rode into camp on the rebel horse, secretly resolving to escape from any more such liabilities. 
               The men made their way back one by one, but many were taken prisoners. 
               Rodney's company returned to camp with a decrease of half their number and having taken six rebel prisoners. But where was their Captain? That he had been taken prisoner was the belief of the men, but nightfall proved that it was not so. The lifeless body of the brave young Captain was borne into camp, together with three wounded men. 
               Great consternation prevailed throughout the ground after this event, and many of the men flocked around our heroine with news of strange import, concerning the late and much lamented Rodney. 
               After this, every day increased the horror of Leoni for camp life, and her fear of detection almost amounted to madness. She fancied the men knew or suspected her, and the character she had assumed became difficult to sustain any longer. 
               Reuben and Rodney both gone, her heart sunk within her. She could not recall Rodney to life; could she not do something to alleviate the pain and misery of Reuben Brown? After the revelations he had the grassy mounds and the quiet sleepers beneath. Could that father have known, that by the hand of his innocent child, even one human creature had fallen, and that Brenton, too, was slain, would he not turn from her with horror? 
               Sights of blood and deeds of warfare were becoming obnoxious to Leoni; she longed to forget the scenes through which she had passed. With these feelings she pondered over the best method of carrying through the purpose. She determined to leave and seek a home with Adele Robinson; once having reached that part, it was the easiest thing in the world to avoid discovery, for her adventure was known to no one save Adele. 
               Obtaining leave of absence for a few days, our heroine started off in the direction of her home. She walked almost to within sight of Adele's cottage. She stopped to view the ruins of the old mill; tall trees lay prostrate in the road-side, and every where could be seen marks left by the ruthless invaders. 
               'Twas evening when she entered Adele's cottage, but finding Adele was absent, she sat beside the window awaiting her return. The child slept in the alcove and the cat played on the hearth. 
               The picture of quiet serenity affected our heroine, bringing back to her heart a desire for all those joys of home, affection and appreciation. 
               Wrapt in reflection, she beheld not the form of her old friend, who, still uncertain, lingered in the door-way. 
               "Can it be?" burst upon her ear, and the arms of Adele were at the same moment thrown around her, while tears of surprise and pleasure flowed freely. 
               There was much to be said, but both felt that not a moment must be lost in resuming the cast off clothing, which Adele had nicely preserved. 
               With mingled feelings of joy and sorrow, Leoni beheld, one by one every vestige of a soldier disappearing. In her heart hopes were springing and anticipations were growing, all right and proper in her sphere of woman. 
               She was soon restored in appearance to her former self. 
               I must now bring my story to a close. After some weeks of rest, Leoni was restored to composure. Adele was permitted to say to Reuben Brown, that Leoni Loudon had been on a visit to an aunt, some miles away, and had returned; having heard of his situation she had expressed a desire to see him. 
               Reuben heard and was more than delighted; the Minister approved of the visit and urged her to see to it soon, setting it down as an act of neighborly kindness, which was enough to insure his good opinion. 
               Reuben was shy at first, but Adele's presence did much towards lessening his embarrassment. Reuben grew better when Leoni was there, and when she left the Minister observed that his malady increased. 
               As he grew stronger, he gave stirring descriptions of his adventures. At such times Leoni's heart beat fast, and she could scarcely refrain from disclosing all. 
               Reuben's old affection increased with these expected visits, which he deemed his right. 
               After months of pain Reuben recovered his health, but never his straight, manly walk. He dared not breathe his love to Leoni Loudon; he was now a cripple; would she marry one who must henceforth lean on something or somebody for support; who never would be able to perform those little acts of gallantry so much valued by Leoni; one who must receive attention without being able to make any return. 
               So he reasoned with himself, until he was tortured into a relapse, during which time Leoni was a faithful nurse. 
               "It will be hard to part with you, Leoni, when I get well," said he, one day after she had prepared some little delicacy for him. 
               "Can you not forget me?" she softly asked, "as you did once before." 
               "I never forgot you for a moment, Leoni," he replied, "even on the battle field you were ever before me. Strange as it may seem, one of our men bore a striking resemblance to you. I loved the fellow from the bottom of my heart, and now I believe the reason was, that he looked like you." 
               "You don't tell me so, Reuben, and you have never mentioned the circumstance?" 
               "I thought you might not be pleased with the compliment, was the reason." 
               "You wrong me, Reuben; I dare say he was a noble fellow." 
               "He was indeed, Leoni,-he saved my life, and I owe him all; but do you know that it was you who caused me to go to war?" 
               "You astonish me." 
               "Well, I will tell you:- 
                
               "Do you remember the day when you put your hand in mine, and we both went up to your father and asked his consent,-do you remember, he said yes, and bid me protect you when he was gone?' How resigned and happy you were, until,-until-" 
               Reuben's voice faltered and tears choked his utterance. 
               "Say no more," replied Leoni, much agitated, "I know all; it is a sorrowful recollection and has caused me much suffering. Gladly would I blot the past forever from my memory, if I could, and atone for any act of unkindness I have committed." 
               Reuben changed his position, and looked long and lovingly at Leoni, wondering if she was sorry for his sake. 
               "You are a noble girl," he said, pressing his whitened forehead "You are grieved because you fancy you were unjust; were I to mention to you the only means for my recovery, you might spurn me-perhaps leave my presence forever." 
               Taking fresh courage at Leoni's silence, he gently took her hand and pressed it to his lips. 
               She made no effort to withdraw it, and he continued clasping it within his own. 
               "Oh how I have longed for this moment, to tell you how ardently-how nobly I have loved you; how the memory of our childhood and youth have been engraven on my heart; when our joys and sorrows were the same, when hand in hand we wandered, playing on the same green sward, or studying from the same book. How earnestly I have longed and prayed that my love might be returned, even in part-that you might learn to love me and I might prove worthy of you, the dear playmate of my infancy. 
               "Leoni, you have been the one bright star of my life, guiding my past and shining in my future. Oh, do not weep! Come to my heart. Let m? fold you to my bosom, never more to part. Be mine, eternally; let our hopes be one, our joys, our griefs." 
               Folding her his arms as he spoke, Leoni resisted not. Tears flowed fast, and her frame was racked by tumultuous heaving. 
               "Speak to me, dear Leoni," he said, in low, calm tones; "may I hope that you are mine,-that my love may be returned? Breathe in my ear that sacred promise, and let angels record it above." 
               The whisper reached his heart and entered his soul. Great tear drops of joy and thankfulness stole over his cheeks. 
               That night Reuben Brown's sleep was undisturbed, save by soft dreams of the future. His return to health was rapid, only a slight lameness remaining. 
               I have only to say, in conclusion, that in a sweet cottage over-clad with woodbines and honeysuckles, where the mill-stream plays in summer, dwells Reuben and Leoni. Violets and daisies peep out from the soft, long grass as it waves to the breeze; an arbor of roses and jessamines shelters the neat porch, under whose shade repose its owners. Their lives are undisturbed by the malice of the world, for they live to themselves; and there is but one secret that Leoni has kept from Reuben. 
               I may add, that she is always watching among the wounded soldier. who atop at the gate, for a pair of black eyes like Rodney's; she keep the package handy, that she may deliver it to the owner, should he pass that way. 
             
            THE END.
