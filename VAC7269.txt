IN all ages of the world we find that true learning and information -all great discoveries in nature, art or sci- ence-by which mankind have been benefitted and im- proved, are the fruits of minds abstracted from the com- mon cares and turmoils of life; in many instances, in fact, by men who have withdrawn from all human soci- ety, and become solitary hermits. It is true that this class of individuals have sometimes exercised an influence on their fellow-men not quite so beneficial; and perhaps in some instances, absolutely baleful and injurious -as in the cases of Mahomet the Prophet, and Peter the Hermit. But whether for good or evil, it cannot be denied that the investigation of the profound mysteries of nature, and the powers and attri- butes of Deity, require the calm of solitude, rather than the noise and hubbub of every-day life. In the following pages we shall discover, either the manifestation of Divine goodness and condescension, ex- tended to mankind through an individual of the above class; or a hallucination of mind, joined to method in thought and expression, amounting to a revelation, which most assuredly cannot have originated in the brain of a madman.  But whichever theory is adopted, the narrative is one that well repays perusal, and may awaken thoughts and reflections highly interesting and beneficial to the reader. Although there are occasional strictures on some of   iv.          PREFACE.  the theories of the day, taught as the Christian religion, a thorough reading, and proper understanding of the Old and New Testaments, will show that the ideas herein inculcated are strictly in accordance with those authori- ties. Let every reader investigate and think for himself, lay- ing aside and discarding from his mind, all inventions and traditions of men. PUBLISHER. U     . -' a  *   TO THE READER. IN preparing the following narrative for the press, care has been taken to adopt the language, so far as practica- ble, used by the original writer. In a few instances, how- ever, slight changes have been made, in order to modern- ize words and expressions which have become obsolete;  or to render into English sentences written in dead or for- eign languages. But in all cases of such change, the, exact meaning of the writer has been given, as near as possible. The poetical quotations at the head of each chapter were not a part of the original writing, but may be re- garded as an interpolation or addition, by the editor, to give variety and interest to the work. The beautiful quotation from Pope's "Dying Christian," at the end of the last chapter, is, however, an exception to the above. That was selected by the hermit himself, and was found in print, pasted on the paper at the end of his narrative. For the truth of the statements made by the hermit, and the miracles by him' recorded, it will of course not be expected that the editor or publisher should vouch or be responsible; but of his existence and death, and the find- ing of the papers and money, as herein stated, testimony of scores of credible witnesses can be adduced, who were acquainted with the facts and circumstances narrated.

RESIDENCE OF THE HERMT--HS HABITS-WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A WIZ- ARD-FOUND TO BE A MAN OF EDUCATION-HS APPEARANCE-WAS KNOWN AS THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS-HS DEATI--HE LEAVES TWO BOXES AND A LETTER-ONE BOX CONTAINED GOLD COIN, AND THE OTHER THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE. "At the close of the day when the hamlet is still, And mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove; When nought but the torrent is heard on the hill, And nought but the nightingale's songin the grove: 'Twas thus by his cave on the mountain afar, While his harp rang symphonious a hermit began: No more with himself or with nature at war, He thought as a sage, though he felt as a man." * - C - -Dr. Cotton. A FEW years ago there died near the southern boundary of the State of Virginia, on the side of a spur of the Cum- berland Mountains, an aged heirmit, whose death, at the time, created quite an excitement in the neighborhood, and was published and commented upon by the papers of that date. This man had occupied for a great many years-how many was not exactly known-a cave partly natural and partly the work of art, in the side of the mountain. He, or some one else, had erected a small cabin near to, or rather partly over the entrance to the cave, which served him as a shelter during mild weather, both in the daytime   18      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. and night; but in the hot weather of summer and cold weather of winter he passed most of his time within the cave. Here he had fitted up a kind of bed-room, with a few old sheep-skins and blankets, which, with some straw, served him as a couch, or rude bed. These, with a rough bench and table, as conveniencies for sitting, eating and writing, together with an iron lamp and a few old books in Englisl, Greek and Latin, constituted the furniture of this, his subterranean dwelling. His only fire was kept in his cabin or outside building, and what little cooking he did was done there; but as his interior, or sleeping- room was some distance within the cavern, there could have been but little variation in temperature in summer or winter. The rock from which the cave had been exca- vated was a very dry sandstone rock, and not particularly objectionable on occount of humidity. At the entrance of the cave, and near the corner of the cabin, was a spring constantly flowing with the purest of water; and as this water was of the same temperature at all seasons of the year, it contributed much in equalizing the temperature of the cabin, in both summer and winter-in the heat of summer particularly, rendered the air of the cabin pleas- ant and agreeable. On the side of the mountain, near this strange dwelling, there was a piece of some two or three acres of land that had once been cultivated, but at the time of the death of the hermit, and for some years before, it had been neg- lected and had grown up to briars and thistles. Some of the older citizens living in the valley below remembered when this patch of land was well cultivated, producing fair crops of Indian corn, potatoes, cabbages and other garden vegetables. At that time the hermit kept a cow, a dog, and a few fowls, but for a number of years he had no cow,   IN HS CAVE.        19 and within a few months of his own death, his dog and chickens had died, leaving him entirely alone. The few people who resided in the neighborhood had strange ideas regarding this hermit. By most of them he was considered insane, while others regarded him as a wizard or conjurer, and strange stories were told of his powers and performances in controlling and directing the winds, and producing the thunder, which they heard roll- ing in the mountains. Who he was, or where he came from, no one pretended certainly to know; but the opin- ion most generally prevailing, among those who did not consider him a supernatural being, was that he was an officer in the army of General Braddock, and that on the defeat and death of that unfortunate commander on the banks of the Monongahela, he had fled in a half crazed condition to that wild region, where he had found and taken possession of the cave on the mountain. Notwith- standing these strange and contradictory opinions enter- tained by the ignorant, a few gentlemen, better informed than their neighbors, had made thd acquaintance of the hermit, and had found him to be a man of fine intellect and extensive education. His knowledge of ancient history and the classics were far beyond that of a majority of edu- cated men of the present day. But in strictly modem history and current literature he was deficient. On these he. showed a disinclination to converse. His memory of events long since passed was truly surprising. He could give the date and particulars of every battle and skirmish of the Revolutionary War, with the accuracy of personal knowledge. In one respect he was singular and remark- able. He could not bear female society. The mere sight of a woman seemed to cause him intense pain, and almost to drive him into spasms. Whenever any women intruded    20     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. upon his presence, which they sometimes did, from mere curiosity, or to test his dislike, he would immediately re- treat into the innermost recesses of his cavern, where he would remain until, by a cautious reconnoisance, he was sure they had left: and for a number of days after would decline all conversation, even with men. The personal appearance of this man was very striking and peculiar. Of a large and muscular frame, he showed that he had in his younger days possessed great physical powers, and even at his advanced age his figure was straight and erect, and his movements active and elastic. His hair and beard, which were uncropped, were as white as snow, and had grown to an unusual length, reaching below the waist. Indeed, it was not surprising that the ignorant and super- stitious inhabitants of that section of country shouldj have regarded him as something supernatural to this earth, and have classed him among beings of other spheres or plan- ets. He was generally known as the "Monk of the Moun- tains," and a threat of his coming was often made use of by mothers and nurses to quiet disobedient children. Exactly how he lived no one knew, but it was certain that for a number of years he had derived no support from farming or gardening, and that one of his resources in years gone by, he was now deprived of, in the death of his cow. Every two' or three months he visited a mill some two miles from his dwelling, and purchased a small quan- tity of corn meal, which he carried home on his shoulder. hlle quantity, however, was considered much too small to support a man of his size, who depended upon that alone. He had, also, a few times been seen by hunters on the mountains, picking berries or gathering nuts; but gener- ally he was to be found in his cabin, engaged in reading or writing.   IN HS CAVE.         21 Whenever he purchased meal he paid for it in gold, of ancient coinage, or in the silver he had received in change at former purchases. This led many to believe that he had large stores of treasure, hidden away in the recesses of his cavern, while others believedthat he possessed the Philosopher's Stone, or was in league with the devil, which enabled him to obtain all the money he wanted. His clothing seemed never to be changed. It was of fine ma- terial, but of ancient cut and fashion, and the Fame in both summer and winter. With the exception of his visits to the mill, he was never known to enter any other building than his own dwelling; though it was reported that at some former period, he had once or twice been seen at a country store, about twelve miles away, where he had made some few small purchases, and obtained a file of old Philadelphia newspapers. Why he did not attempt to cultivate the acquaintance of the few neighbors who lived in his vicinity, was left to con- jecture; but the general opinion was, that his fear or dis- like of the female sex served to neutralize any disposition he might have for society. That many of his neighbors would have been pleased to form his acquaintance, and would have been kind to him, there is no doubt; but all advances on their part were most persistently repelled on -his. It was about twelve years ago that this man died. A fam- ily who resided in sight of his cabin, on the opposite side of the valley, not seeing any smoke arise from it for a number of days, concluded that he was either sick or dead; and in the hope of finding large treasure in case of his death, two young men succeeded in working up their cour- age to a point that enabled them to pay a visit to the old man's residence, to ascertain the facts. On entering the;   *22     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. cave, which they did with great trepidation and fear, they found the body of the hermit lying on his rude couch, with the appearance of his having been dead for some days. On the table they found two boxes and an open letter. "The letter was directed, "To the person or persons who may first enter the cave after my death." It stated that -one of the boxes (the smaller) contained money, which was to be used by the finder; first in payment of the small expenses of burying the dead body, and secondly, the bal- ance was to be retained and used by him or them, as the case might be, in the fear of God, and to produce the most good possible. The larger box, which was strapped and nailed very securely; must not be opened for ten years, and in the meantime it must remain in possession of the finders, and be kept safely till the expiration of that time. "It contained nothing intrinsically valuable, but would be sure to bring disaster and ruin on any person who should disobey these injunctions." The letter had no signature, but in its place was a figure representing a death's head and cross-bones. On opening the small box, which was done after remov- ing both of them to the house of the finders, it was found to contain about fifteen hundred dollars in gold, mostly in Spanish coin of the days of Phillip the Fifth. This the two young men, after paying the funeral expenses, divided between them; and it is to be hoped, have used it as directed in the letter, in the fear of God and the accomplishment of good. The other box was safely kept until the expiration of the ten years, which was on the sixteenth day of March, 1864; but as both the men who had a right to open it were then absent, one in the Union and the other in the Confederate Army, and as one of them has never returned   IN HS CAVE.        23 'having been as supposed killed at the battle of Chicka- mauga, the box was not opened till the seventh day of May 1866, at which time all hope of the return of the -absent man was given up. When it was announced in the neighborhood that the mysterious box was to be opened, a crowd of some twenty -persons, male and female, old and young, assembled to witness the operation-and notwithstanding the assertion in the hermit's letter, that it contained nothing intrinsi- cally valuable, the prevailing belief was that it did con- tain a great treasure, in silver and gold, or their represen- tatives. It was obvious to those who had handled the :box, that it could not contain much of either of these 'metals, but they could not divestthemselves of the opinion that, from the mystery attending the instructions of the hermit, it must be the depository of great earthly riches in some form. After due preparation the straps and ,fastenings were removed, and the contents of this myste- rious box laid open to view. Excited, as they were, by the high expectation of great wealth, we can readily picture to ourselves the disappointment and mortification of the company, when the contents of the box was emptied out before them, and they saw nothing but a few old musty books, badly eaten by moths, and a large bundle of manuscript writing, so discolored by age and smoke as to be hardly legible. In the mortification and chagrin of the moment the whole lot of trash, as it was called, was about to be consigned to the flames, when one old gentleman more thoughtful than the rest, and by-the-by more learned, and who had often conversed with the old hermit in his life time, obtained the privilege of retaining and-deciphering the papers, provided he could do so. This was not a very   24      TIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. easy task, even for a more learned man; for much of the writing was almost obliterated by age and smoke, and besides, considerable part of it was written in Greek and and Latin. The man, however, into whose hands the manu- script had fallen, had, in early years been a fair English scholar, and was with all, a man of energy and perseve- relnce; and he did not feel disposed to yield in his efforts until lie liad given the matter the benefit of all his facul- ties. At first it was difficult to understand the writer's meaning or to obtain a clew to the narrative, and a less persevering decipherer would probably have abandoned the task in dispair; but after long and tedious study, and a more falmiliar acquaintance with the character of the Denllnlship, the ideas expressed became more obvious to the reader, and he began to feel an intense interest in t:'e story. For many days and weeks he pored over this musty and defaced pile of papers, until his friends almost feared that he had blecamne demented by the writings of one whom they regarded as having, during his life, possessed super- natural powers, and whose watchful guardianship over his work even after his death, they considered highly probablle. In the meantime our friend was getting a very good idea of the main facts disclosed in the manuscript, and forming an estimate of the importance and value of the work. It is true that the Latin and Greek, which was inter- spersed through the writing, sometimes caused a consid- erable hiatus in the narrative, and rendered the meaning of the writer obscure and uncertain. Generally, however,. those languages were only used in short sentences and quotations, intended to give force and piquancy to the writer's meaning. To overcome any difficulty that might   IN HS CAVE.

The professor, who was a young man, a foreigner by birth, but a few years in the country, and who had never heard of the old hermit, expressed a disbelief in the whole story, and would hardly deign to give the papers even a cursory examination. On glancing, however, at some of the quotations in Greek or Latin, he saw that they were not written by an ignorant person, and looking further fell upon passages and para- graphs that fastened his attention and convinced him that the work was one of no common or ordinary merit. At his request the manuscript was left in his possession, and by the aid of his lexicons in translating the foreign lan- guages occurring in the narrative, and by modernizing many of the ancient words and phrases which had been used by the writer, he was soon able to produce the fol- lowing narrative.   26      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.

I W-s born in Lanarkshire, Scotland, of an ancient and prominent family of land owners, in the year 17-, the exact date I cannot tell, (as our family record was des- troyed by accident on the death of my mother, and when I was but a child); and while I was still an infant my father emigrated to the then Colony of Pennsylvania, and settled in the neighborhood of Philadelphia. At the' breaking out of the Revolutionary War, which happened a few years after, and which I very well remember, our family was residing on a farm near the Delaware River. I think my age at that time must have been from ten to twelve years; at any rate I was then going to school, and had made considerable progress in my studies. My father took a decided stand on the side of the Col- onies, notwithstanding his British nativity; and after- wards, when the English, under Lord Howe, took posses- sion of Philadelphia, he was summoned before that noble- man to give his opinion of the feelings and disposition of the inhabitants.   HS EARLY LIFE.       27 Readers of history will remember that this was the darkest period of that terrible struggle which resulted in the independence of the Colonies, and gave birth to a new nation, destined to become the most powerful on the globe. My father very promptly told his Lord- ship that the people were true to the Colonies, and in favor of liberty and independence; that they would fight to the last for the accomplishment of these objects, against all odds that might be brought against them. Among other questions asked my father, was, "Would he join the Royalists and take a commission in the Brit- ish army?"' To this my father returned a prompt nega- tive; alleging that he had adopted America as his country and future home; and come weal or come woe, he would share the fortunes of the people. After considerable effort on the part of Lord Howe to weaken my father's resolution, and failing in every proposition, he changed his tone and tactics, and told my father to consider him- self a state prisoner on a charge of high treason; and immediately ordered him into confinement on board a prison ship then lying in the Delaware River. Of course remonstrance was in vain, and all my father could do was to submit in silence, hoping in a short time to regain his liberty, especially as he had never taken up arms or been actively engaged in the armies of Washington. My mother, who was on the eve of confinement, received the news of my father's imprisonment in great sadness and alarm. She immediately repaired to the quarters of Lord Howe, and with all the eloquence of a true wife, besought him to liberate her husband. She urged the fact that he had never taken any active part in the rebel- lion, and that for his simple opinion he should not be held accountable under the British Constitution. She also   2S      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. urged hler helpless condition, with a young family on her- hands, in a land of strangers, amidst the alarms and hor- rors of war, and begged of him to spare to her her hus- band and protector. To all these appeals the answer was, "The rebels had been too leniently dealt with, and that a few examples were indispensably necessary;" and besides my father "was a native-born Britton, and could not in any way divest himself of the allegiance he owed his King and countrv.* That he was sorry for my mother, but that he was acting under orders from his government, and had no discretion in the matter." Within a few days the ship in which my father was con- fined sailed for England, and neither my mother or any of her children ever saw him more. The vessel was lost  on her homeward passage and all on board perished. The same night my father sailed my mother was brought to her confinement, and from the shock she had received from his imprisonment and expatriation she never recov- ered-both herself and infant died the third day after. With the exception of an invalid sister, I was now left alone in the world, though I did not know of the loss of my father till some months after. About a year later my sister died, and although she was a confirmed invalid, and from an accident early in life must have remained so as long as she lived, still my desolation did not seem per- fectly complete until her death. I now felt, indeed, that I was alone in the world; that all I had loved or valued had left me, and that the only friends I could look to were * This is still the theory of the English and French Governments, but withont any attempt to enforce it.

AT school I made the acquaintance of a boy of about  my own age, whose name I shall call Frank, of a most remarkable disposition and turn of mind; in whose society I spent nearly all my hours of relaxation, and much of tile tilme devoted to our studies. He, like. myself was an   i orphan, and from early care and trouble his mind had acquired a sad and sombre hue, that pervaded all his  thoughlts and conversations. He rarely took part in the namusements of other school boys, but was fond of a quiet walk with one or two companions, or a friendly discus-  sion on some abstruse question of science or philosophy. He was a most inveterate student, reading, commenting Ilpon, and analyzing works and subjects, generally regard- ed as far beyond the comprehension of boys of his age. At about fifteen both he and I were sent to Princeton College, and much to my gratification were placed in the same class. Thrown among strangers our intimacy with, t   AT SCHOOL.         31  and attachment for each other were greatly increased; neither of us seeming ever to tire of the company of the. other. My friend's turn of mind as I have said, was what is usually considered sombre, or at least pensive and thoughtful; and when not actually engaged in our allotted studies, we-were often conversing on and discussing, so far as we were able, the attributes of Deity and the mys- teries of creation, which it is not given to the mind of man fully to comprehend, while in his present state of ex- istence. The wonders of astronomy, the boundlessness of space, the endless duration of eternity, the incom- prehensible existence of God; without beginning and without. ending, were often the topics of our conver- sation or the subjects of our reflections. Often times when these subjects were discussed, and the intellect strove to expand itself sufficiently to under- stand and comprehend them, my brain would seem to reel, my breath would be suspended and the pulsations of my heart cease for a time, until my very existence would , appear a matter of doubt, and life itselfan unsolved prob- lem. I need not say that those conversations produced a marked effect upon my mind, my thoughts and conduct. From being a cheerful-rather thoughtless boy, I became reflective, silent and pensive. The common and ordinary affairs of life lost their importance in my estimation, and I only took an interest in subjects far beyond my compre- hension, and which God in his wisdom has withheld from the knowledge of man. Even the exciting incidents of the war, which was then in progress, could hardly enlist an interest with me, suffi- cient to keep me informed of the battles or their results. The effect upon Frank was entirely different. He would converse on all these abstruse mysteries with the same  32     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. unconcerned cheerfulness that others would talk on ordi- nary topics, and then turn to his usual studies with as much avidity and apparent relish as though nothing else had ever occupied his thoughts or attention. As a conse- quence, while he stood at the head of his class, I was barely able to maintain my standing in it, and save my- self from being degraded into a lower position in the school. While on most of scientific and philosophical subjects Frank and I agreed, there was one important matter on which we always took opposite sides. He was a firm be- liever in the immortality of the soul and the truths of Revelation, while on these subjects I was skeptical. I agreed with him in opinion as to the existence, the power, and goodness of the Deity, and on the moral character of tile teachings of Jesus of Nazereth; but of the Divinity of Christ, his mysterious resurrection and power in the Godhead, I had doubts, and was always free to express them. Our discussions on these subjects, though friendly, often became zealous and animated; and like most discussions, where positive demonstration is not practicable, only, served to confirm and strengthen each in his preconceived opinion. rOne evening, after a more than usually animated and l'rotracted argllent, llmy friend made the following rather startling proposition: That whichever of us should first die, whether that event should happen early or late in life, should return to the other, if such return were permitted, and disclose to him the condition of the dead, as they ex-  isted in the world of spirits. Without hesitation I accepted  the proposition, and firmly entered into the agreement as proposed.   AT SCHOOL.         33 This happened in about my eighteenth year, and on ac- count of failing health, and on the advice of my friends I soon after left college, and for a few months betook myself to travel and amusement. s* \   34      TIlE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.

AFTER spending a few weeks in Philadelphia to prepare myself for the journey, I started in company with the son of mI guardian to explore what was then regarded as an unknown land. At this time the Revolutionary war had just closed, and the country had assumed its place among the independent nations of the earth. And though it was generally known that the territory belonging to the thir- teen colonies or states, whose independence had been acknowledged by the mother country, was of immense extent, very little knowledge of the detail or face of the western country was possessed by any except hunters and trappers, or those adventurers who had passed some time with the Indians. No roads had yet been constructed far into the interior, and of course all travel in that direc- tion must be on horseback or on foot, and as the former mode involved considerable difficulty in procuring the  necessary provender for animals, most of the explora-  tions were made on fool. After many deliberations and frequent consultations with those supposed to be best   ON HS TRAVELS.        35 informed on such matters, it was finally concluded, consi- dering that time was not important with us, that our jour- ney should be undertaken in that way. We had decided to travel west from Philadelphia, cross- ing the Alleghany mountains in the direction of the head of the Ohio river, where the town of Pittsburg had recently been laid out, and was then attracting consider- able attention; and near where General Braddock had been defeated by the French and Indians some thirty years before; and from there take such direction as cir- cumstances and our discretion might dictate. At that time it was not considered perfectly safe for small parties to travel much beyond that post; for although peace had been agreed upon, and nominally established between the belligerent parties to the Revolution, still many of the Indian tribes had not been pacified and their hostility was more dreaded than that of much larger bands of civilized enemies.' However, as we were young and inexperienced, and knew nothing of real hardship, we pictured to our- selves great enjoyment from the wild and really aimless adventure which we were about to undertake. After con- siderable formalities in leave taking, we at length got started, carrying with us only such luggage as we consid- ered indispensable, and such as we could carry in packs on our shoulders. From Philadelphia our main course lay nearly west, and for the first hundred or more miles, until we reached the Susquehanna river, we had the advantage of poor country roads, and the society of white inhabitants. After crossing that river we had only bridle-paths, over which all merchandize and supplies for the western country had to be transported on the backs of horses and mules. As might be expected, our progress was very slow, averaging   33    uTHE MONK OF THE MOTUNTAINS. not over eight or ten miles per day. We took with nus botl guns and fishing-tackle, and with them we amused ourselves when opportunity offered, and sometimes pro-- cured food for a luxurious meal. After leaving the village of Louisburgh,* then recently laid out on the eastern bank of the Susquehanna river, we passed through a country but very little inhabited. A few hardy pioneers had settled along the route of the pack horsemen, and were commencing their improve- ments in the wilderness. Sometimes we found rude log lhouses where a primitive lettered sign annonnced that entertainment could be had for man and horse; and as  we had no particular stages to make, we usually stopped where appearances were most favorable, whether early or late in the day. ()On reaching the mountains our road became more diffi- cult and laborious; being at times so steep and precipi- tous as to render our passage extremely slow and arduous.  However, as we were in no haste, and through the aid of our guns and fishing-tackle, felt pretty independent on  tlhe score of food, especially as we took the precaution at  all times to carry a small supply in our knapsacks, and as  the weatler was warm, and we could pass the nights  whllen necessary in the open air, we enjoyed this portion of our journey very greatly. Generally we found the  cabins of the settlers or the tents of movers going west of the mountains, in which to pass the nights, and from which to obtain food as often as we needed. One vexatious source of annoyance, or rather appre-  hension, was the great number of rattlesnakes that we were constantly meeting with on the mountains. But as they invariably give notice by their rattle before biting, : te Now llari riburgh. -j   'ON IIS TRAVELS. T37 Ij ^ve- escaped all injury from their fangs, and at length came to regard them as rather honorable than otherwise in their dealings with men. In fact very few persons are bitten by them, unless they themselves are the aggres- sors. On the tenth day after leaving Louisburgh we reached a medical spring, which had been re ommended to me before leaving Philadelphia as possessing very extraordi- nary curative properties of nearly all the ills that flesh is heir to, and at which I was advised to stop to recruit my wasted energies before proceeding into the far western country. Before reaching this marvelous spring, however, I found that my health was being rapidly improved by the exercise I was taking in the pure mountain air, and what was, perhaps, equally efficacious, my relief from study and profound thought. At the spring we found some half a dozen invalids from Philadelphia and other places, who had been attracted there by the reputation of the waters; as being, in fact, the very fountain of youth and elixir of health. Some of the invalids had been able to reach there on horseback, while others had been brought all the way from Philadel- phia on litters. We found the water of this wonderful spring anything but pleasant to the taste, or fragrant to the smell. When taken fresh and cold from the spring it might be toler- ated; but after standing awhile, losing its effervescing gas, and becoming slightly warm, it assumed the odor of rotten eggs, and tasted very much as we can suppose ithat kind of perfumery to taste. We stayed at this rude watering place four or five dlays, angling and shooting by day, and lodging in rough log cabins by night, On the whole, enjoying the wild beau-    38      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. ties of nature and our sports very greatly. From these circumstances we no doubt derived health and vigor; but as to the waters of the spring I am no convert, either to their health or pleasure giving properties. In fact, both my friend and myself voted them a humbug. * From this spring to Pittsburg, at the head of the Ohio river, the distance was something more than one hundred miles, over mountains and through valleys, abounding in bears, panthers, rattlesnakes, and other interesting inhab- itants. We made this distance in eleven days, and arrived without accident in this land of promise, where so many were already seeking their future homes, and anticipated appiness. Pittsburg is situated at the junction of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, which together form the Ohio,  and contained about three thousand inhabitants. Those : interested in the town prophesied great future prosperity; but for myself, I could not see the elements from which it was to spring. It is true that the three-rivers afford nav-  igation a large portion of the year, but they extend into  countries rough, wild and unpromising; which must  require a very long time before they can become the abode of industry or civilization; and besides, the current of the rivers is so strong as to make transportation on them extremely difficult, except down stream. f At the confluence of these rivers stood the old French fort Duquesne, now called Fort Pitt; and about fifteen miles up the Monongahela river, was fought the battle in which General Braddock was mortally wounded. , The spring here mentioned was undoubtedly what are now known as the Bed- ford Springs-quite celebrated and numerously visited. t The reader will bear in mind that this was before the invention of steam- boats.  ']i   ON HS TRAVELS.       39 At Pittsburg we saw the first mineral coal that we had ever seen burning, and which seemed to be highly valued by the inhabitants. It burns with a bright blaze, produc- ing an intense heat, but throwing off a smoke extremely black, dirty and offensive. I cduld not believe that it would ever come into general use as a fuel. It seemed to exist in great quantities; cropping out of the hillsides all around the town. We here made the acquaintance of two French catho- lic missionaries, on their return to Canada, from a visit to the French settlements on the lower Mississippi, the Kas- kaskia and Missouri rivers. They had ascended the Ohio river in a bark canoe, navigated by two converted Indians, and were taking Pittsburg in their way home, for the purpose of looking after the religious interests of a few French inhabitants that had remained in the neigh- borhood, after Fort Duquesne had fallen into the hands of 4the English. On the invitation of these good fathers we consented to accompany them through the Indian coun- try, and by way of the great lakes, as far as the white set- tlements on the western boundary of the State of New York. We did this more willingly, as the Indian tribes were under the complete influence and control of these missionaries, which would ensure our entire safety while passing through their country. This was an important consideration, as these savage nations still exhibited a hostile disposition, and had recently committed some depredations on the frontier settlements. On leaving Pittsburg, we proceeded down the Ohio river for about thirty miles, to Fort McIntosh,* situated on a high plain on the right hand, or north side of the river. Here we found a small garrison stationed for the Now Beaver Town.   40      TIE MOXNK OR THE MOUNTAINS. defense and protection of the frontier settlers, who were making their homes in this western wilderness. A few adventurous settlers had already began to de- scend the Ohio river, to make homes on the banks and in the neighborhood of that strearil. Most of these emi- grants were from eastern Virginia, Maryland, Pennsyl- vania, and the New England States. Occasionally ac- counts would be received of horrible Indian outrages and massacres, inflicted on the remote white settlements. Indeed, there seemed to be no safety in those wild regions outside of forts and block-houses. And yet many families continued to disregard all these dangers and difficulties, and to seek homes in those distant and savage countries. From Fort McIntosh, where we left our canoes and took horses, our route was by land towards the setting sun; and after a day or two, over a level though rather swampy country, until we reached an open champaign region, and a river running north into Lake Erie. This river is called the Sandusky, and here we found the first large collection of Indians, or natives, that we had seen. In an open space extending for miles without timber, called by the French  a prairie, were encamped some hundreds, or perhaps thou- sands, of these dusky savages. To them our French mis- sionary leaders seemed particularly welcome. They con- versed with ease in the Indian tongue, and appeared to be regarded with both love and veneration. With a few of the chiefs, who could speak the French language, my friend and I held conversations, and were treated by them with savage politeness. The squaws gave us food com- posed of Indian corn, or maize, beans, and the flesh of the deer, bear, and other wild animals. On the whole, we fared sumptuously. We remained at this place two days, during which time 1   ON IIS TRAVELS.       41" our missionary friends celebrated mass, and performed various other of their religious ceremonies, greatly to the instruction and apparent delight of their hard featured and dusky auditors. We here changed the horses which we had ridden from the Ohio river, for two canoes made of bark, with which we were about to undertake the navigation of two of the great lakes, Erie and Ontario. We also changed our Indian guides for others better acquainted with the lakes, and the management of our frail craft. N   42      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. CHAPTER     V.

AFTEt taking leave of our Indian entertainers, we de- scended the Sandusky river into a bay of the same name, through which we passed into the open lake.          . In each canoe was one of the missionaries, myself or friend, and two Indian voyagers. The labor of managing    . the canoes was mostly done by the Indians, who seemed  perfectly to understand their business, and to realize  their responsibility. Off the mouth of the Sandusky bay, some ten miles dis-  tant, was a timbered island, six or eight miles long, on   j which we encamped the first night. The peculiarity of this island was the great number of rattlesnakes, and snakes of other varieties, that seemed to have exclusive possession. Indeed, so numerous were they, that my friend and I took turns in watching through the night, to guard against their attacks. They might be  said to exist by millions. We all rejoiced on getting -   ON HS TRAVELS.        43 under way in the morning, and leaving this island of ser- pents in the distance. We were, now blessed with a fair wind, and our Indian mariners knew well how to take advantage of it. Raising a small sail with which they were provided, our frail barks scud through the water like things of life. At first our situation seemed particularly dangerous. At open sea, as it were, in a craft which could readily be borne on two men's shoulders; with four full grown persons, baggage, &c., in a pretty stiff gale, a shipwreck did not appear a very improbable event. However, what appeared our greatest danger, probably proved our salvation. The frail, egg-shell character of our craft kept us before the wind, and caused us to yield to every passing wave, thereby securing greater safety than a stronger and heavier vessel would have done. During the whole day our Indian voyagers hardly spoke a word, but with super- stitious awe, seemed to feel that they were in the imme- diate presence and care of the Great Spirit. About nine o'clock at night we rounded a peninsula on the south side of the lake, which brought us into a harbor called Presque Isle.* Here e found a missionary sta- tion, a trading post, a small military force in a block-house} and a few French, Indian and other inhabitants. Our reception was friendly, and by the French and Indians particularly cordial. For this %e'were no doubt indebted to the sacerdotal character of our missionary friends. In the- remote catholic settlements the arrival of a priest is quite an event. Marriages can now be solemnized, children baptized, confessions made, and any little omis- sions of religious duty that may have been accumulating,   "     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. can now be attended to, and the devout follower of the Church started anew on his career of devotion. From this point we were able to despatch letters, by way of French creek and Pittsburg, to our friends il Philadelphia. In about two days, our missionary friends having completed their pious duties, we were ready to resule our voyage upon the lake, and as the wind was still favorable, the labor of navigation was reduced to simply keeping our light vessels on their proper course. Irom Presque Isle to the Niagara river, which is the out- let of the lake, is about one hundred miles, and this we ran in twelve hours, landing on the west side of the river, near a British fort. H-ere we encamped for the night, and in the miorning resumed our voyage down the Niagara river; our object being to visit the great Falls, then the wonder of the world. During the night, as we lay upon the ground, we could distinctly hear the roar of this great cataract, althougll some twenty miles distant; and it may well be supposed that my friend and I, who bad never seen it, should feel great impatieace to see this muighty wonder. About noon we reached a small stream, which runs into the river, called the Chippewa creek, into which we ran our canoes and obtained a very good harbor. This was quite an important matter to us, for although three miles above the great cataract, the current here was quite strong, and a failure to make a sure fastening might have been followed by destruction. For a mile or more above the principal fall, the river beconles very rapid, presenting a succession of perpendic- ular descents that would attract great interest were it not for the "Great Fall " that so immeasurably eclipses all the rest. From Chippewa creek to the main descent, the river js estimated to fall something over fifty feet. On arriving   ON HS TRAVELS.        45 in sight of the great fall or principal descent, I must acknowledge a feeling of disappointment. It was cer- tainly a grand affair, but somehow did not come up to my romantic expectation. The fall is said to be one hundred and fifty feet in one perpendicular, unbroken sheet; but viewed from the high ground, considerably above the level of the river, it did not appear to me to be above fifty feet. On descending to the level of the river below the fails, however, we were able to get a better view of them, and telen their great magnitude and grandeur be- came apparent. They are certainly one of the wonders of the earth. There were a few white families settled here, composed mainly of tories from the States, old dilapidated soldiers,. and French fishermen from Lower Canada. Altogether a rough uncultivated society, possessing little inter- est or attraction. )Our company remained here three days, while our Indian voyagers were transporting our canoes and luggage, from Chippewa creek to the river below the falls and rapids-in all nine miles. Over this portage they carried our canoes on their shoulders, and with the aid of some other Indians, that seemed to be hanging around for jobs of the kind, they had all our lug gage properly stowed aboard, ready for a voyage on the broad Ontario, all within the three days-saving to them- selves sufficient time to indulge in one grand drunk, before again embarking upon the fickle element. Froim the point of our re-embarkation to the mouth of the river, the distance is some seven miles, and here on the Canada side is situated the village of Newark, and an earthen fort commanding the entrance to the river. Our' course from here was along the soathenr shore of the lake. to Oswego, about one hundred and eighty miles; but.   "     TIlE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. here we had not the good fortune that attended us on Lake Erie. The winds were adverse and fickle, oftentimes taxing the whole powers of our Indian navigators, aided to some extent by our own, to hold our way against the opposiing waves, and secure us from danger. After labor- ing some tour days we reached the mouth of the Genesee river, having run one hundred miles only. Here we resolved to stay until favored with a change of wind. We soon erected a tent upon the shore, and moved such articles into it from our boats as to make us comnfortable. On the river there were great abundance of ducks and other wild fowl, and from the waters we could obtain any quantity of the finest of fish, so that our table wlas both abundantly and luxuriantly supplied. We remained here awaiting a change of weather for three whole days, but on awakening on the morning of the oturth we found the wind blowing directly in our favor, and we lost but little time in preparing to take advantage of the change. Our Indians were the very patterns of attentive mari- ners, and were especially alert in using their sails, when the wind would permit, rather than depending upon their paddles. It was, therefore, but a very short time before  we had dispatched our breakfast, had all our traps stowed aboard our canoes in a snug condition, and we ourselves  in the open lake, almost flying before the prosperous gale. t We had only about eighty miles to run, but before we made j that distance the lake became very rough, and we had  fearful apprehensions that we .might be introduced to  Davy Jones. However, through the religious invoca- tions of our pious missionaries, the stalwart exertions of our Indian voyagers, and the sea-worthiness of our light   ON f TRAVELS.         47 and buoyant craft, syae safely weathered the storm, and about 4 o'clock, P. M., gailyntered the harbor of Oswego. Here we found a British fort* that had quite an ancient appearance, in which was stationed about eighty soldiers under the command of a Captain Hudson, of the British army. There were also in and around the fort quite a number of filthy, ragged-looking Indians, said to be of the Onondaga tribe; one of the six nations that origin- ally occupied the territory now composing the State of New York. As there were no French families here our missioners had very little to do, and remained with us only one night, for here we separated; they taking their course down the lake in the direction of the St. Lawrence river, while we prepared to leave the lake and ascend the Os- wego river, in the direction of AlbaAy and New York. When about to part with us they insisted on our accept- ance of one of their bark canoes, and through the influ ence of Captain Hudson we obtained the aid of two Indians to navigate it until we should reach the waters of the Mohawk, where we could obtain others of the Oneida tribe to take us down the latter river to Albany. Their services had, of course, to be compensated, as well as those performed by the Indians who had accompanied us from Sandusky. The stock of silver brooches, beads and other trinkets which we had brought from Philadelphia, stood us therefore in good turn, and we parted with our dusky allies in high favor as to our liberality. We found the Oswego river extremely rapid, and diffi- cult of navigation. In one place, indeed, we encountered  * Fort Oswego was originally built by the French taken by the British in 1756, confirmed to them in 1X63.

At this fall our Indians unloaded our canoe and carried it on their shoulders something over a mile into comparative dead water above the rapids. On the fourth day after leaving Oswego, we reached some remarkable salt springs; but in order to do this we had to deviate from our direct route, and pass up a small stream into a narrow marshy lake, on or near the shores of which these springs make their appearance. The salt water seemed to be in great abun- danece and very strong. Fifty gallons of it when evapo- - rated, it was said, would produce a bushel of salt. At these springs we found some two hundred of the roughest look- ing men that I had ever seen, engaged in boiling down X the water in common iron kettles, for the purpose of obtaining salt for the settlers in that new country. Our stay here was very short, for the stench arising from the :- extensive marshes, and from the boiling water, was per- fectly intolerable; besides it was understood that no per- son could remain there long and not be attacked with   ^ fevers and agues and other diseases. However valuable the salt springs may be, I cannot believe that the coun- try round about them can ever become of much import- ance.* We retraced our course through the small lake called  I the Onondaga, down its outlet into the Seneca river, down- that until we reached the Oneida river, which with the Seneca forms the Oswego. Our course now lay  ! up the Oneida river, through a lake of the same name, thence up a narrow and very crooked stream called Wood  creek, to Fort Stanwix; thence over a short portage to * The-e alt springs were undoubtedly those near the present city of Syracuse, and the writer of the above opinion would be much interested, if alive, to see how eas y it ii to be mistaken. 4'   ON HS TRAVELS,          4td the Mohawk river and Fort Schuyler. These forts were erected during the recent war, and garrisoned by the Con- tinental troops, but were now unoccupied.* From Fort Schuyler our route was down the Mohawk river; and here we parted with our Indian aids, and engaged two others of the Oneida tribe to accompany us as far as the town of Schenectady. We found the Mo- hawk similar in its character to the Oswego, full of falls and rapids, and very difficult of navigation. - Along its banks, Which in many places were rich and level, a con- siderable number of Hollanders were settled, who seemed prosperous and contented. From, Fort Schuyler to Schenectady, though down stream, required six days. t Throughout our whole route from Oswego toSchenectady, we found abundance of game and fish, and were never without amusement and luxurious food. At Schenectady, for the first time since we left home, we -met with an acquaintance. A gentleman of Philadel- phia out of health, had been recommended to visit the Saratoga Springs, and at his solicitation we o6nsented to accompany him. At these springs we found quite a num- ber of invalids, located in log cabins and tents, nearly all of whom considered themselves benefitted by the waters. Unlike the mineral springs of Pennsylvania, the waters here were pleasant to the taste, and perhaps, from that fact, we had much greater confidence in their medicinal qualities. We remained here some ten days, visiting the grounds where the battle of Bennington was fought, the' camping ground of General Burgoyne, and where he sur-   * These forts were built by the English government in 1758, and taken by the Americans in 1776.

The land throughout this -whole region is extremely sterile and barren, and whatever importance may be attached to the medicinal springs as a place of resort for invalids, the country can never become of much account for agriculture. A few stunted pine and whortleberry bushes, with laurel and mountain tea or wintergreen, seemed to be almost the only productions. On leaving the springs, where we left our Philadelphia invalid friend, we returned to Schenec- tady, and from thence about fifteen miles to the city of Albany, situated at the head of sloop navigation on the Hudson river. This is claimed to be the oldest incorpo- rated city in the United States, and is particularly notice-, able for its high steep-roofed buildings, with their gables to the street, after the fashion of Holland, from whence its founders mostly emigrated. At Albany we took passage on board a packet for New York, and by extraordinary good luck and favorable winds we reached the latter city in seven days.* We remained in New York five days, and then took passage in a fast line of coaches for Philadelphia, where we arrived after a passage of two and a half days. *'.KoSv rrformed b steamboa in ten ours and y railroa in four * Sow performed by steamloat in ten hours anid by railroad in tour. f - N!A} N. i   AT PHLADELPHA.          51       i CHAPTER     VI.                  j WELCOMED AT HOME-CALLED ON BY PROMNENT CITIZENS-  A FORTUNE LEFT HM BY HS UNCLE--AS MANY FRIENDS-        ; ANDS SOME TIME TIN PLEASURE AND DISSIPATION.

Our journey had occupied some- thing over three months, and as we had passed through and over a country but little known to the people at large, we found ourselves quite the lions of the city. We were called upon by the prominent citizens, among others by Benjamin Franklin, who had just returned from his ministerial labors in France, Governeur and Robert Morris, Benjamin Rush, and others, and required to give descriptions of the Western country, in which all took so deep an interest. Our descriptions were necessarily meager, as our tour was not intended as a scientific one; but as we had seen the Ohio river, the great lakes, and the mighty Niagara falls, which few others had done, we were regarded with an interest almost approaching vene- ration. This trip was especially advantageous to me, as it gave me health and vigor of constitution, besides introducing   TIlE MONK OF TIE MOUNTAINS. me to the acquaintance of prominent and influential men, who proffered aly assistance or advice that I might stand inl Heed of: In addition to this, I think I can say, without egotism, that it gave me a more practical and enlarged idea of the extent and value of our country, the beauties of nature, and the love and goodness of God, than I could have obtained by theory in any school that I mighlt have attendled. And I would here suggest to all young men, onl comlpleting their scholastic education, to take a few months' active exercise in the fields of nature; where their bodies will not be hampered by rigid, artificial rules, or tleir Iinds cramped and dwarfed by the pedantry of tlhe schlools. After a fewn days of calling and receiving calls, resting and fitting up after our long tramp through the western wilderness, I began to look around me and form plans of business, and for my guidance through life. I had resolved not to return to college, though I had left without having graduated, and was advised by some to do so. But from my last few months' experience, I was satisfied that a more active life, in the open air, with a free intercourse withl btusiness men, would contribute to my health and enjoyment more than the confinement in school, or en- gagements in literary pursuits. I found a few hundred pounds in money belonging to me,-saved by the care and good management of my guardian,-and a legacy of ten thousand pounds sterling, left me by my mother's brother, who had died recently in England without children. These sums at that time were considered quite a fortune, and of course I had many friends, who earnestly and zealously tendered me their advice and assistance in investing my money, or in form- ing business associations, that could not fail to result in   AT PHLADELPHA.       53 splendid success. In almost every instance, however, I discovered that my friendly advisers had reserved some little interest for themselve's or their near relatives, in which they would participate with me in the expected advantages. This at first gave me much pain, as I had seen mankind only through books, or in my slight inter- course with my fellow students, where disinterested friendship is, described and believed to be the rule' of human conduct, and not the exception, as I now began to discover was the fact. However, in the new life that I was now leading, and amid the attentions that I was constantly receiving from old and young of both sexes, I soon forgot minor consid- erations, and fully believed that there was a great deal of real merit and genuine, disinterested- friendship, in the world. Of the purity and goodness of the female sex I had no doubt. Whatever men might be, women were but little, if any,.below the angels. My former life in school had brought me very little in contact with female society and as I was rather shy and bashful, my whole knowledge of the sex was limited to a formal acquaintance with  small number of ladies, met in places of public resort, an, my landlady and her servants where I boarded. My studies and reflections on abstruse subjects had en- grossed my whole attention, and I was as truly ignorant of every-day, practical life, as though I had been an inhab- itant of another world. It is not surprising then, that when I was "brought out," as the term is when applied to young ladies, and introduced into society, fashionable and wealthy; and on account of my reputed wealth, courted and feted by old and young, male and female, my head should have become somewhat giddy, and my mind more or less confused.   54      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. For a few months I was in a constant whirl of pleasure and excitement. Balls, parties, routs and excursions, were mny daily and nightly employments.. Still, amid all this whirl of dissipation, in moments of rest and retirement, thoughts of more serious import would intrude themselves upon me. Eternity, with its never-ending duration! God, and his mysterious, unlimited power and attributes!- these and other kindred subjects would force themselves upon my mind and reflection, in spite of all my efforts to put them away. Sometimes in the midst of society-even in the mazes of the giddy dance-I would forget myself so far as to commit serious blunders, from the fact that nmy thoughts were wandering among the stars; or in at- tempting to comprehend what God has placed beyond the conIprellension of man. This state of things continued for nearly a year, during which time I was regarded as a most fortunate and happy man. My wealth was ample, my friends numerous, and the whole world seemed spread out before me to pick and choose from, as I might think best. From my friend Frank, who still remained at college, I occasionally received letters, breathing the warmest friendship and attachment, but still tinged with his con- stitutional seriousness, and often alluding to the abstruse matters that seemed never to be absent from his mind.

"In peace, love tunes the shepherds' reed; In war he mounts the warrior's steed, In halls, in gay attire is seen, In hamlets, dances on the green; Love rules the court, the camp, the grove, And men below and saints above; For love is heaven, and heaven is love." Walter Scott. "Oh! love, love well, but only once! for never shall the dream Of youthful hope return again on life's dark rolling stream'. Mrs. Norton. ABOUT this time I made the acquaintance of a young lady, who was regarded as among the most beautifulkand accomplished ladies of the city. She was the daughter of a prominent and wealthy merchant, who had spared no pains or expense on her education, and who, it was ex- pected, would leave her a large fortune. To say that I was charmed and captivated by the beauty and conversa- tion of this young lady, is only stating the simple truth. It seemed to me that I had never seen beauty or excel- lence before. I gazed upon her lovely countenance, and listened to her musical accents, until I was completely intoxicated and carried away with sensations wholly new to me, and entirely beyond my power of description. Our first acquaintance was at a private ball or party, given by the partner of her father; and during the even- ing, I so far forgot myself as to monopolize her company   56)     TIIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. Iearly the whole time-so particular was my attention, that a number of my most intimate male friends took occasion to caution me against what they were pleased to term, the danger of my captivity. My only fear was that my love (for I could call it nothing less,) would not be returned or reciprocated by my charmer. On handing ler to her carriage, I intimated my wish to extend our acquaintance, and asked the privilege of calling on her the following day. This request was readily granted, and after some endearing and flattering expressions on my ;ile, (which now appear to me simple and childish,) we parted until the morrow. That night, for the first time in my life, I knew what it was to be in love, and whoever is of the opinion that love is a pleasurable sensation, has most assuredly never experienced the passion in all its concentrated intensity. In an agony of hope and fear I walked the floor of my chamber nearly the whole night. I could not think that a being so bright and perfect could possibly fall to my lot. It seemed impossible that some more fortunate man had not already seen her beauty and secured her affec- tions. After daylight I became somewhat tranquilized and obtained an hour or two of sleep, from which I arose in a haze of doubt and uncertainty. As soon as fashion would permit, after a most studied land elaborate toilet, I called upon the lady and found her prepared to meet me. She appeared quite as beautiful and interesting in her simple morning dress as on the pre- vious evening-lher beauty indeed, rather improved by daylight. She seemed, in fact, all that was perfect and desirable in woman.  For myself I felt awkward, and under a constant embarrassment. Whenever I at- tempted to express myself I seemed to forget the use of   HS MARRIAGE.        57 language, and often failed almost to make myself intelli- gible. The lady seemed to take no notice of this, but would reply to me in her blandest and most musical tones, and in language that showed that she was perfectly at her ease. The sentiments she expressed evinced high moral culture, and extensive reading and reflection; and while on the evening previous, I was charmed by her beauty and more superficial accomplishments, on this occasion of private-and quiet intercourse, I was struck with admi- ration at the extent of her information, and the depth of her thoughts and intellect. On my departure I was invited to call again, at my early convenience, and to make my- self at home in her father's house. Of this invitation I availed myself again and again. Walked, rode, and sailed with my beloved, and under all circumstances, and in all situations, found her nearer perfect, and more desira- ble (if possible,) than my fancy had painted her on our first acquaintance. It is enough to say that before the expiration of two months, I had proposed-was accepted, and the day of our nuptials been fixed upon. As soon as this important matter had been definitely arranged, I turned my atten- tion to business, and soon accepted one of the many offers that had been made me to enter into partnership in a mer- cantile house then established and doing business in the city of Philadelphia. The arrangement I made was considered highly advan- tageous, and was generally understood as certain to lead to prominence and wealth. If any man ever seemed to have secured the advantages of wealth and the smiles of fortune, I was certainly that man. Blessed with health, friends, position, pecuniary prosperity, and the love of a   58      TTIIE MONK OF TIIE MOUNTAINS. most estimable woman, there seemed to be nothing in this life desirable which I did not possess. After our marriage, which took place at an early day, and was accompanied with the usual display, and our set- tlement in a splendid house in the fashionable part of the city, purchased, furnished, and presented to my wife by her father, I betook myself to the business of the firm with which I had connected my fortunes; and for a time everything progressed to the perfect satisfaction of all concerned. My wife proved herself the most loving and devoted of wives, realizing all my fond hopes and expec- tations; the business of our house was attended with un- exampled success in all our operations; while our numer- ous friends became still more numerous and attentive, and seemed to vie with each other as to who should pay us the highest honors, or contribute the most to our hap- piness. Could the hunan heart wish for more perfect bliss? or if it did, where could it be found? Certainly not in this world. About one year after my marriage, I was called to Eng- land by the sudden death of an uncle on my father's side, who llad by will made me his principal heir, and who had urgently requested that I should attend personally to the division of the estate, and to the settlement of his help- less maiden sister, whom he had also provided for. I was anxious that my wife should accompany me on the voy- age, but as she expressed great repugnance to traveling 1)y sea, and as it was expected that my absence would not be long; with a heavy heart, and .many forebodings of evil, I took my departure without her.

Too faithful mirror! how dost thou reflect The melancholy face of human life." -Anon. MY passage was by one of the best shipis of that day, and was made in safety, in what was considered unusually short time: twenty-five days. On my arrival in England I found the affairs of my uncle's estate very much complicated, and likely to detain me considerably longer than I had anticipated. Still, as I had made so good a beginning in my short passage across the ocean, I felt encouraged, and took hold of the business necessary to be attended to, with alacrity and confidence. Those who are at all acquainted with the laws of England need not be told of the forms and vex- atious delays attending business in the Doctors Com- mons,* through which all estates in their settlement must necessarily pass. These delays and vexations were greatly *This was formerly the Court of Probate of England.   3)0      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.  increased 1)y the fact that I, who was principally inter- ested in the estate, and named as executor, was a for- eigner. On learning what were the dificulties I should hlave to encounter, and the time which must elapse before I coulld again behold my dear wife, I was almost disposed to surrender all claim to my uncle's estate, and lose no tinie in returning to my adopted country. And had it not been for the injunction of my uncle, expressed in his will, and the fact that a dependent and helpless aunt relied upon my personal exertion in securing her interest, I verily believe that I should never have takelr up the b)usiness, but have returned immediately to the United States. Iowever, after a few days of close application I )egan to unravel the tangled condition of the estate, and before the expiration of six months had so far arranged matters that I was able to leaye the business in the hands of others, and prepare myself for re-crossing the' Atlantic ocealn. In the meantime I had often written to, and received letters from. my wife and business partner. For the first three or four months my letters were answered promptly 1)y )oth,-those received from my wife breathing all the ardor of love which she expressed on our parting-those fron my partner full of friendship and confidence, and giving Ine the particulars of the operations of our house. For the last lonth or two I thought I could discern a slight difference in the tone and expression of the letters of both. I might be mistaken, for after all, the difference, if any, was so slight as hardly to' be perceptible, and might lbe caused b)y accidental circumstances. Still I felt unlteasy, 'faring that all might not be exactly right, and was anxious, very anxious, to reach home. For more than a month before nly emllarkation for home, there had been   IN ENGLAND.         61 no arrival from the United States on account of adverse winds, consequently I had been without letters all that time; and of course my anxiety was wrought up to the highest degree on being compelled to leave without the expected intelligence. Our voyage home was long and tedious, even for that day. Twice we were driven nearly back, after making more than half the distance across the ocean. At length, however, on the ninety-seventh day out, after having been over three weeks on short allowance of food, and with hardly any water, we were landed in Boston, I being re- duced almost to a skeleton, from my anxiety of mind, and the privations I had suffered on the voyage. The travelling of that day from Boston to Philadelphia (if not by sea) was usually by stage-coach, and required nearly a week to accomplish the distance. In my weak- ened condition I could hardly expect to perform it in less time, even if I did not break down entirely in the effort. Still I could not think of any delay, and as soon as I could get my luggage on shore I entered my name for New York. In a little over four days we reached that city, and as I could get no intelligence from home there, as soon as possible I started for Philadelphia. On reaching Prince- ton, New Jersey, we were detained one whole day from the breaking down of our coach, and it was not till late at night on the eighth day from Boston that we crossed the Delaware river and entered the city of Philadelphia. I left my trunks and other luggage at the hotel, and late as it was, went on foot to the well-remembered home, which I had left more than nine months before. On arriv- ing at the door and applying the knocker, I at length aroused a sleeping servant, who raised an upper window and demanded in a rough, African voice, what I wanted '   62      TIIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. I gave lhtr ly name, and asked for my wife. 'Lord masa '." ie replied, "that woman has been done gone these t hree Ilontlhs,-run away with her husband's part- ner!'"I lheard no more, but sunk senseless on the door- ste l. The servant girl, as I was subsequently informed, came down, and after considerable effort succeeded in bringing me to consciousness; and from her and the gentleman of the houlse, who soon made his appearance, I learned that sonme three months before that time my wife and partner had left the city together, travelling as man and wife, and the la1st trace that could be found of them, they were making their way to France through. Charleston, South Carolina. This information, joined to my former privations and anxieties, completely prostrated me, both physically and mentally, and for four weeks I was entirely unconscious of existence. At the end of that time my intellect was partially restored, but my body was weak and feeble as that of an infant. After languishing for some two months longer, as was supposed upon the very brink of the grave, I began slowly to recover. During this time my father-in-law was fre- quently with me, but would impart no information on the subject of my misfortunes, until I began to mend and gain strength. From him I then learned that the conduct of i!- wife had brought her mother to an untimely grave, and that his own health had hardly sustained him under the dreadful accumulation of his misfortunes. The latter I need not have been told, for his appearance gave suffi- cient evidentce of the fact. I learned further that my partner, by forced sales, had converted all the means of our house to ready money, the proceeds of which, in bills   IN ENGLAND.          63 of exchange, he had taken with him; besides leaving large liabilities against us which we had now assets to liquidate. My father-in-law was among the heaviest sufferers, and for a time he had doubts whether he could avoid bank- ruptcy. This information, as may well be supposed, greatly retarded my recovery; but with the aid of a good constitution and the constant attention of friends, I grad-- ually but slowly regained my strength. As soon as I was able to be out, the creditors of our house held a meeting and generously proposed to contribute means to start me again in business, leaving it to my future success whether I should ever repay them for such aid, or any part of our past liabilities. This proposition I promptly and firmly declined, and expressed my determination to appropriate the fortune I had recently inherited from my uncle in dis- charge of the liabilities against our house, and to retire forever from the society of men. For their kind offer I expressed my thankfulness and gratitude, but had no heart again to mingle in the affairs of life. The world with all it contained was as chaff and ashes in my estimation; and after the infidelity of my wife, and perfidy of my bosom friend and partner, I could never again place confidence in living man or woman; and I prayed that death would soon release me from what seemed an insupportable existence. My friends and creditors, particularly my poor father-in- law, strove hard to dissuade me from this resolution, but all their persuasions and arguments were fruitless, land as soon as I could do so, I executed deeds of trust of all in- terests I had, either in the estate of my uncle or in the remnants of interest in our broken house, for the benefit of our creditors. After a careful calculation, I was grati-   tiel to klol,w that I had plenty to pay all our debts and tleave ;t small surplus, which I reduced to money, and with xwiicil I retired to this mountain cave. Before taking pos- -tession hlere I purchased a few acres of land, including the cave, the deed* fir which will be found among imy  ,tiler pap)ers.  t01' m  wife and partner, I never heard a word and have ,o kllowledge of what became of them.

I BROUGHT with me to the cave a few books and writing materials, which with my dogs, cow and chickens, have been my only companions for many long and lonely years. I have had a few visitors who have kindly loaned or gave me newspapers and-amphlets, which I have read with much care and inker though it was my original inten- tion to sever all connection with the world, and hold no communication -with any of the children of men. From  the papers which I have read, and the informa- tion I have, from time  to time received from my visitors I have some faint idea of the great progress which has been made by the country in arts, sciences and improve- ments. At this I  rejoice, but at the same  time  I have serious doubts whether the general happiness of the peo- ple has been thereby increased. At the time of my re- tirement there were no steamboats, Canals, railroads or telegraphs; and from what I learn, these are now common throughout the land. Still I  have but an imperfect idea how any of them look or operate, having   seen  none of them.  My  visitors have often described them to me, 4"  G43   THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.  but my mind on these subjects is yet in the dark. They must be great inventions, though I think the world would have been better without them. In my retirement my thoughts have often reverted to the studies of my youthful days, when my early friend Frank, and myself were trying to investigate and under- stand those mysteries which God in his wisdom has with- held from human comprehension. I have looked abroad and have seen Deity in every plant and flower, in every tree and rock, and pebble of the mountain. I felt my daily and hourly dependence on is power and goodness, and I longed to know whether this life, with its pains and sorrows, its troubles and disappointments; its wretched wrong and oppression, inflicted by our fellow men, was all that was vouchsafed to us throughout the endless dura- tien of eternity! Was man to live after this life, or was death an eternal sleep? I read the few books I brought with me, including the Old and New Testaments; I studied the firmament- the sun, moon and stars of heaven; I examined the economy of nature, as manifested in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and the geology of the earth; and still was in doubt as to the objects and intentions of God in the cre- ation and destiny of man. The various theories and creeds of religious sects were equally obscure and unsatisfactory. That God was the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; the Three in One, and One in Three; that the Son was equal to, and was the Father, seemed an unintelligible jargon, and only served to make the darkness still more intense and im- Neither could I believe that the Supreme Ruler of the universe-The creator and supporter of all things-whose love and goodness I could see in every object around me,   IN HS CAVE.         67 ever did, or ever could require the sacrifice of blood, as an atonement for the sins of a race of beings, which He himself had created, and whose nature and disposition he had formed to suit His own views and purposes. In the meantime many a weary and lonely year passed away, and I found myself slowly but surely approaching that age, when worn out and exhausted nature is required to lay down this fleshy tabernacle, and whether prepared or not, to launch into the unknown future: and at least so far as this world is concerned, to be known no more again, forever. The suffering which I must endure in solitude, as the feebleness of age advanced upon me, or the pains of the final struggle-alone and unattended-had no terrors f6r my mind; for what was the suffering of a few months or years of privation, or the momentary agonies of disolution, when compared with the overwhelming question of im- mortality or annihilation? Amid all these painful uncer- tainties the promising and consoling lines of the poet would occur to me.         I Shall life re-Visit dying worms, And spread the joyful insects' wing? And Oh! shall man awake no more, To see Thy face, Thy haame to sing t Why this manifestation of the Divine will of a univer- sal resurection, if man is not to participate in the benefi- cent economy  But why should we fear annihilation? surely there is no pain in nonentity.

Who feels the loss of existence for all time previous to his birth-for that half of eternity already passed and gone? Verily, man is a combination of incon- sistencies and contradictions.   CHAPTER X.

'he compact or agreement with my early friend would often obtrude itself upon my recollection, and I would enquire mentally whether he was probably still alive; and  if so, whether he had not most likely forgotten our arrange- ment. The last I had heard from him was through a let- ter of condolence, which I received just before my retire- ment from the world; at which time he had completed his theological studies, had been ordained as a Presby- terianu minister, and permanently settled over a church in the town of Easton, on the Dejeware river. This letter was couched in most affectionate terms, intended to com- fort me under my great misfortunes and afflictions, and closed with an allusion to our early religious arguments and final compact.   TAKEiN TU PARADISE. .U           ' One evening after a long ramble over the mountains and just as I was' sinking into repose on my rude pallet, my cave became as light as midday, and before me stood my early friend, Frank, who immediately addressed me in a clear and distinct voice, saying: "I have come to fulfill the engagement entered into with you while I was in the flesh, arise and go with me." 'As I had never heard from Frank since my withdrawal from the World, and of course had no information of his death, I gazed for a moment into his face with something like awe and amazement, but without fear. His whole appearance was natural and life-like-clothed as when I last saw him. He appeared somewhat older than when we parted, but by no means as old as I should have ex- pected to see him. His countenance Was bright and beautiful, and seemed lighted up and animated with a heavenly smile. His whole appearance, in fact, was that of a superior being, still retaining enough of his former resemblance, to be readily recognized, and not to be mis- taken for another. I immediately arose, without fear' or trepidation, and was about to put on the garments which I had thrown off when I laid myself down, when my spirit friend motioned me to desist, and said: -'You will want none of these, follow me." Immediately on gaining the open air, he threw a mantle over me, and taking my arm, we began, without any effort on my part, or apparent labor on his, to rise--slowly, at first, but soon with greater rapidity- until in a short time we seemed to fly through the air with almost the speed of lightning. For a time all seemed dark and uncertain, and during this part of our flight I became unconscious-whether from sleep or stupor, or through the power and will of my friend I cannot say-nor how   long I continued in that state, but when I recovered my senses, we were just entering an atmosphere the most brilliant and beautiful that it is possible for mortal to conceive of. It was neither sun light, moon light, or any- thing else that I had ever seen or dreamed of; but a rich and beautiful aurora of the most gorgeous and bril- liant hues-far beyond the powers of language to de- scribe. The countenance of my friend was lighted up, as with a bright halo, and every expression seemed a manifestation of intelligence and love. We soon reached a beautiful country, covered with the most enchanting foliage, flowers and fruits, that ever de- lighted the eye or regaled the senses, and were greeted with a gush of soft, rich music, that seemed the product of innumerable meolian harps. On a motion of my spirit guide, without effort or noise, we alighted on a slight ele- vation, overshadowed by a magnificent palm tree, upon the limbs of which, and scattered through its foliage, were thousands of the most beautiful birds, whose mu- sical notes filled the whole air with the richest melody. At a motion from my friend all became silent, and he then led me to a seat in the verandah of a small cottage, which was almost covered and embowered with flowers, under tlhe shade of the palm tree. Hte now took his seat by my side, and in a friendly and familiar manner addressed me, saying: iYou are now in the first Heaven, or as we may call it, Paradise. Here the souls of men come after death, and are judged in accordance with their lives and conduct while on earth. If their conduct has been meritorious or even satisfactory, they are permitted to remain and join their friends who have come before them. Here the old and decrepid become young and vigorous, and children   grow to maturity. Here bodies are again furnished us and we are permitted to enjoy ourselves in the gratifica- tion of our senses. But this is not the eternal resting place of the just made perfect. Other Heavens are still above us which must be reached, through meritorious conduct, in regular gradation, as our powers are increased and our intelligence is enlarged. The works of God, his eternal nature and attributes, are better understood here, and more fully comprehended than in the world below, only in proportion to the enlargement of our ideas and the improvement of our intellects. The circle of our vision is increased, but darkness prevails beyond. And it is a noticeable fact, that as we become enlightened, we also become more conscious of our weakness and igno- rance, and more fully realize our entire depenjpnce on the power and beneficence of our Heavenly Father. As we ascend in our progress toward the throne of the Most High, new faculties and senses are bestowed upon us, which add to our pleasures .and increase our happiness. All this you will understand at the proper time, but a further description would be unintelligible to you now. "On the other hand, those whose conduct in life has not been satisfactory are punished in proportion to their demerits. If criminal in the extreme, they are con- demned to return again to the earth, and there animate the bodies of the lowest and most offensive reptiles. If less criminal their condemnation is less severe, and their de- scent in the scale of animation less extreme. From these points they are permitted again to ascend until in regular gradation, from animal to animal, they at length arrive at the dignity of again animating human bodies, when they are given another opportunity to fit and qualify themselves for Paradise.   72      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.  You must know that every living creature is animated with a soul as perfect in its kind as that of the most per- fect man ;* that nothing either material, vital or mental, is ever destroyed. It may be changed in form, but never annihilated. The vital principle of the lowest in- sect is as much an emanation from Deity as is that of a human being, and can no more be obliterated from exist- ence. The soul of every living creature, has in its turn animated the bodies of inferior animals. All starting at the lowest point and rising in regular gradation until reaching the dignity of manhood; which is the dividing line between Earth and Heaven. Other modes of punishment or discipline to induce reformation have also been provided by Omnipotence. For minor offenses or less wicked lives, a purgatory exists where punishments are rather negative than positive- where privation from the joys and happiness of Heaven, rather than the torments of the traditional Hell, are in- flicted upon the disobedient and contumacious, until thorough repentance and reformation are produced, and the sinner thus reclaimed is fitted for a residence in the regions of the blest. The object of Deity being reforma- tion rather than vengeance. The Christian religion, properly understood and prac- ticed, is the true rule for mankind to follow, but much that is taught as the Christian religion is the invention and traditions of men. Simple faith without works, is like the barren fig tree, and will keep no man in Paradise; and works alone without faith and repentance, will be equally unavailing. Where much is given, however, much will be required, and where little is given less will * And are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is for-  gotten before God?-LUKE xxII, 6.   TAKEN TO PARADISE.      73 be expected. All will be afforded an opportunity-even the heathen, who never heard of the Saviour-to reach the realms of bliss, provided their conduct has been in accordance with what they believed to be just and right. Here my friend paused for a moment, and then re- suming said, "You must be fatigued and hungry, rest and recruit your strength, and at another time I will inform you of other mysteries attending the existence which we here experience, and to which you are fast hastening." With a clap of his hands he summoned an attendant, who appeared in the form of a beautiful youth of fifteen or six- teen years old, clad in flowing garments of bright and cheerful colors, with a golden girdle around his waist, to whom he simply said, "refreshments for our guest." The youth bowed and led the way into the cottage, where my friend and I followed him, and where to my sur- prise I found a room of moderate dimensions, fitted up and furnished very much as nice surburban cottages are, near the cities in the lower world. Floors carpeted, walls papered, and pictures and other ornaments hanging around, to break the monotony, and give cheerfulness to the room. The furniture was very much like that which I had beenaccustomed to see before I withdrew from the society of man, and was all in the nicest and most beauti- ful order. My friend again addressed me, observing that I could here make myself comfortable and at home, that I would be waited upon by the youth whom I had seen, and at my pleasure I could occupy a bed which I would find in an adjoining room, to which he pointed. There too, he said, "You will find a wardrobe with such clothing and linen as you may require." He now took his leave, promising to see me again on the following morning.    74      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. Directly after he left, my servitor returned, bringing with him my morning meal, which consisted of such articles of substantial food as I had been accustomed to while in the world below, among the children of men. There was coffee and toast; broiled chickens and beefsteak; hot rolls with butter, and such other accompaniments as usually grace a well furnished table in the neither world. As I had been without food since the day before, and had then only eaten a supper of roots, nuts and vegetables; and as it lad been many years since I sat at a well supplied table, I made a hearty breakfast, and only desisted from a fear of the consequences that might follow too great an indul- gence. After breakfast I took a seat in the veranda, where my servitor brought me a goblet of liquor, which he called nectar, and which he presented me on a golden tray. Though a long time had passed since I had indulged in such luxuries, I now resolved to gratify my inclination, and soon experienced the most delightful sensations that can possibly be imagined. In my happy reverie I forgot all my long sorrow and misery, and felt in fact, that I was exalted into heaven. In the meantime, the birds in the trees warbled forth their most charming music, which joined to the soft melody of unseen veolian instruments, soon disposed me to sleep, and following the directions of my friend, I retired to my bed, where I soon fell into a most profound slumber.

"Thrice happy world, whose gilded toys No more disturb our thoughts, no more pollute our joys." - Watts. How long I slept I have no idea, but during my slum- bers my dreams were of the most happy and delightful character. I thought that I was again young; that my friend Frank, as he used to appear, and I, were walking through groves of gorgeous beauty and fragrant odors; that birds of the richest plumage and most musical notes, were our constant attendants; that streams of the purest of crystal waters, in which we could see fishes of beautiful hues, flowed gently along our course, and all nature seemed in harmonious unison, with our pensive though exultant thoughts. Our conversation, as of old, was on the subject of the goodness and power of God, and the mysterious wonders of his works. Frank still seemed my instructor and monitor. His conversation appeared the result of Divine inspiration, and when he uttered his thoughts it seemed to me that I was reading from the book of the Most High.    76     TTHE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.  At length my dream or vision was at an end, and I awoke from my slumber, when before me stood my youthful servitor, with a silver basin of water, a linen  towel, and a crystal vase of delightful perfumery. He simply announced that my breakfast would soon be ready,  and retired.  While I was performing my morning ablution, my ears were again regaled with the same heavenly music that  had accompanied my retirement the day before. The birds, the harps, and other seolian instruments seemed blended in the same rich harmony, and produced a concert  of sweet sounds that can never be erased from memory. Again food was brought me, with beverages fit for saints or angels, of all of which I partook, with a zest and appe- tite known only to good health and conscious rectitude. My friend Frank now made his appearance, and after a cordial salutation, took my arm, saying, "We will not  commence our serious studies to-day, but will stroll arid wander through the gardens of Paradise. As we proceed  you will see many things that you do not understand.  Ask freely for information, but carefully abstain from speaking to any one but myself. You must be aware that few persons are permitted the privilege you now enjoy, without first passing through the dark valley of the  shadow of death. Those whom you may meet have all  passed through that dread ordeal." As before, there seemed to be no tendency to descend or fall, and no effort needed in our onward movements. We moved simply by the force of volition. The ground over which we passed was covered with verdure soft as velvet, and all along our route we were among foliage, flowers and fruits, such as I had dreamed of during the previous night.   IN PARADISE.         " We often saw groups of people in the distance, dressed in loose robes, of brilliant hues, who appeared to be enjoying themselves in various ways, similar to the chil- dren of men in the world below. I asked my friend for an explanation of this, observing that I had been taught to believe that singing, praying and thanksgiving, were the constant employments of those who had reached the land of bliss. His answer was that he "knew that such doctrines were taught, greatly to the injury of the cause of religion. For," continued he, "few persons would covet an eternal class-meeting, however much they might enjoy it for a season. The objects of our Maker in plac- ing us here, are evidently that we may enjoy ourselves, and that our natures may be perfected for other and more exalted spheres to which we are destined to ascend. There we shall be again purified, and indued with addi- tional powers, faculties and senses, which will increase our knowledge and enjoyments, fitting us for higher and more holy spheres, to which in succession we shall be elevated, throughout the endless ages of eternity." My friend, seeming to read my thoughts, continued. "You cannot yet comprehend Infinity. Know, then, that the love and power of God, the extent of the universe, and the duration of eternity, are without limit, beginning or ending. Incomprehensible as it may now be to you, the time will soon come when you will understand that our knowledge and enjoyments will -continue to increase throughout the never-ending life of Deity. This is a manifestation of the goodness and wisdom of God, that no monotony or satiety shall ever detract from, or dimin- ish, our perfect happiness; but that, while our enjoy- ments, in every stage of existence, may be said to be full and complete, we shall still be looking forward to other,   7S      TIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. more varied and intense happiness, without limit and without end. And, to preh any jealousy or discon- tent that might arise from the inequ of our positions, we have the facts constantly before us that t igin of our being commenced at the lowest point inthe se of  existence, and that we are constantly progressing towards the highest." We now ascended a considerable elevation in the land, from which we had an extensive view of the country  around us, and the scene that was presented can neither be forgotten or described. All seemed one grand pan- orama of beauty, life and happiness. There were magni- ficent rivers, with their banks fringed with the brightest  foliage and richest of flowers; fields teeming with abun- dance of grain and fruits, among which meandered de-  lightful brooks and streams of the purest of water. Inter-  mingled with all of which could be seen groups of people -men, women and children-gamboling in all the wan- tonness of delight and happiness. Nor were there want- ing animals usually regarded of an inferior nature. The noble horse, the patient kine, the docile sheep, and other domestic -creatures, were all there in abundance and pris- tine beauty. There, too, were the feathered tribes in great variety, clothed in the most brilliant dyes, and in- dued with the richest musical notes. Addressing my friend, I enquired if I was indeed to un- derstand that this was the spirit-land? That all these people were the disembodied spirits of persons who had died in the world below?"These," he replied, "are the spirits of persons who have died in the lower world, and whose lives having given satisfaction and approval here,  have been re-embodied, and are now passing through a happy existence with their friends and former associates;   IN PARADISE.          79 and being perfected in their physical and mental organ- ization, preparatory to other translations to regions more elevated and holy, and nearer to the throne of the Most High." And the animals and birds, said I, what of them? He answered, "The animals and birds are as necessary to constitute a heaven of bliss as any othel concomitants of our former existence; besides, as I have already informed you, they are indued with souls as perfect in their kind as those of men; and nothing in creation, either spiritual or mental, is ever lost or destroyed. What happiness could you enjoy in a world inhabited only by disembodied spirits, divested of all physical organization, and of course without senses, and where nought but singing and prais- ing was to be heard, if such a solecism could exist, through- out all eternity? This was not the doctrine taught- by Christ while on earth. He promised his disciples that they should sit at his table in his Kingdom in Heaven; * and rest assured that he made no promises which will not be fulfilled by his Heavenly Father. The wisdom of man is but foolishness and arrogance in the sight of God, and has never been able to fathom his most superficial designs." I asked my friend what meant so many children? Are they of the former world, or were they born here? His answer was that "many of those we saw were children who had died in the world below, and who were improv- ing here in body and mind to a more perfect being. But a number of them were those whose mothers died before parturition had taken place, and in those cases the birth and growth of the offspring were consumated here."   *"Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. "And I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me: "That ye may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."-Luke, chap. xxii, 28th, 29th and 80th verses.   80      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. The whole landscape as far as I could see, gave evidence of a dense population, and of a highly cultivated country.  Single habitations, villages and cities,* bearing a striking resemblance to those in the lower world, everywhere abounded. Indeed, had I not known otherwise, I might have imagined myself in some highly improved and cul- tivated country in the mundane world. As the day was now far advanced, my friend proposed that we should return to my place of rest, and taking my hand we returned as we had come, without labor or effort on my part, to my lodgings of the previous night. Here my friend again took leave of me after wishing me a good night's rest, and promising to see me again in the morn- ing. My table was now spread with my evening meal, com- posed of all the luxuries I could desire. Again I ate, again I drank of the heavenly nectar, and again I retired to the veranda of my lodging, to enjoy the contemplation of the glories and beauties around me. As this was the first time I had had an opportunity of  witnessing the approaching evening and the setting sun in Paradise, it may well be supposed that I was greatly  interested in these heavenly phenomena. Throughout the day the sun had shown with a mellow light, softened by an atmosphere similar to that of our Indian summers, and as it descended towards the western horizon, its ap- parent magnitude increased, and its color was heightened to a beautiful ruby, till on its disappearance below the horizon it left a reflection of deep rose color that lighted up the whole western sky. The full orbed moon now arose in the east "in clouded majesty," as expressed by * "In my Father's house are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you." -John, xiv, 2.   IN PARADISE.        81 Milton, accompanied here and there by the faint glimmer of a star, that seemed to be striving against the unequal competition; altogether presenting a scene calculated to awaken feelings of gratitude and devotion to God, the Maker and Supporter of all these things. What with contemplating the glories and beauties of he night, listening!to the enchanting music which brushed from every branch and limb of the surrounding trees, as on the previous night, and reflecting on what I had seen and heard during the day, it was late before I retired into my chamber and betook myself to sleep. 5   "o      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.

THS night my sleep was sound and undisturbed by dreams, and it was well into the morning before I awoke. When I did awake I found my friend standing before me, who, after a little pleasant raillery on what he called my industrious habits, he retired from the room, affording me an opportunity to dress and prepare for breakfast. After the usual preparation, I found my breakfast ready, and as mv friend awaited me in the veranda, I made a hasty meal, and anounced myself prepared to accompany him. Without giving me any information of where we were to go, or what our particular object was that day, he took my arm and as before we arose from the earth without exertion, when almost immediately a darkness came over my vision and for a while all things were hidden from my view. When light again appeared the whole scene had changed. Instead of foliage, flowers and fruits, and an inhabited country, we were alighting upon a point   AT THE OCEAN OF ETERNITY.     83 of level, barren sand, extending far into a boundless ex- panse of waters. My friend now broke silence for the first time since we left my lodging. Pointing to the heaving flood, he said: "You see what is emblematical of Eternity. This ocean has no bounds and although you can see a short distance over its waters, it is only as you are permitted to see a short space ahea4 as you pass from time to eternity. I speak of time and eternity as they are understood in the world beneath. With us there are no summers or winters, no years or centuries, no past or future; all is one eternal present. These things will be clearly comprehended by you when you become an in- habitant of Paradise. From this point I can open to your view the door of the future, and show you a few chapters of the book of destiny of the world below. Would you now wish to raise the veil which hides the unborn years, and contemplate the condition of your friends and country for the next decade 8 "On my: expressing a wish to do so, he put into my hands a small telescope, saying: "Take this glass and raise it to your eyeand be sure to remember what you see. But, stay, would you not like to look at the past for a few moments before penetrating the future? If you hold the end of the glass on which is the silver band to your eye, you will see what has gone before you, but if you would view the future you must look from the golden end of the tube." I raised the silver end to my eye, and immediately saw my father as when I last parted from him, when on the point of sailing to England a prisoner. As I continued to gaze on him the ship seemed to get under way and soon to be overtaken by a storm, and after being tossed about for a time, to founder and go down. I saw my father struggling in the water and at last sink beneath   the waves. I also saw my mother, as she appeared in her last sickness. Saw her die, and saw the funeral cor- tege that accompanied her body to the grave. The fea- tures and appearance of my parents seemed perfectly natural and familiar, though many long and lonely years had passed since I saw them. I turned to my friend, and asked: "Where now are my father and mother?"He answered: "They are here in Paradise, and if you de- sire it you can see them, but will not be permitted to speak, or make yourself known to them. You shall see them at another time, but not now, you are-not yet sufficiently schooled to control your feelings. Raise the tube again to your eye and tell me what you see." I did as directed, and immediately there stood before me my wife, in all her youthful beauty and loveliness, and her paramour,--my former partner and friend,-on whose arm she was leaning. Although many years had passed since they had in- flicted those terrible wrongs upon me, during all which ! time I had schooled myself to forget this false and faitr one, and had striven to forgive both her and the base man who had betrayed her to shame, and both of us to ruin; though I was then in the winter of life, and had been tempered by long years of adversity; and though by a strange translation I was then standing in the presence of one whom I regarded as a supernatural being, still I could not restrain my feelings, or govern my anger, but forgot for a moment that what I saw was but the shadow of the past, and rushed forward to avenge my wrongs on the miscreant before me. My friend soothed and quieted me, observing that what I saw had passed many years before, and that punishment of the severest charac- ter had long since overtaken both my wife and her   AT THE OCEAN OF ETERNITY.      5 seducer. "I subjected you to this trial," said he "not for the purpose -of inflicting unnecessary pain or harrowing your feelings with unpleasant memories, but to convince you that your impulses are not yet sufficiently subject to your control to be trusted under circumstances of excite- ment and temptation." By the language and manner of my friend, my anger was allayed and my agitation quieted, still the desire to hear further from my wife, and learn her fate, absorbed and- controlled every other considera- tion. I hurriedly asked what became of her, and what was her present condition My friend seemed disposed to evade a direct answer, but on my pressing him he said, "both your wife and her paramour are now suffering pun- ishments of the severest character, and expiating their thies and crimes in a manner that, if reform be possible, will produce both that and repentance." He continued, "after their flight from Philadelphia, they proceeded to Charleston, and thence sailed to France," as I had been told on my return from England-that in Paris they had rioted in luxury and dissipation for a year or two, when by gaming and extravagance the ill-gotten means of my partner were exhausted; that my. wife and he, after quarreling, had separated-he to the gaming table and she becoming the mistress of a General of the Guards, then on duty in that city. A few years were all that was neces- sary to sink her to the lowest degradation. From being the mistress of the general, she soon became the mistress of the subaltern, then of the private, then the common courtesan--the inmate of a low bagnio, where she died from the effects of poison administeredby her own hand. The fate of her destroyer was equally miserable and disgraceful After wasting at the gaming table and other places of debauchery, what little means he had left when   SG      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. the separation took place, he betook himself to drink, and became so besotted that he was discarded by his for- mer degraded associates, and could not even obtain admittance to any of the gambling hells that he had pre- viously frequented, and at last actually died of starva- tion and exposure in the streets of Paris. As to their present condition I can only say, that on presenting them- selves at the bar of Paradise they were condemned to return to the earth, there to animate the bodies of the lowest reptiles, from which they have arisen to other existences, and are now slowly progressing to the dignity of man and womanhood; from which at proper times they will again present themselves here, when they will again be adjudged, on the same principles, and with the same impartiality, that they would, had they never been con- demned-and should they then be so purged of their wickedness and frailties as to be admissible, they will be placed on an equality with others of our inhabitants, and permitted to improve and perfect themselves for higher and holier spheres. But should they again be found want- ing, they will be again remanded to some lower stage of existence, and be destined to trace over the same passage of disgrace, again and again, until they learn by experi- ence that the ways of the transgressor are, indeed, hard to travel; or if partial reformation has taken place they may be condemned to purgatory, where their punishment, as I have before told you, will consist in privations rather than positive inflictions, and where their term of proba- tion is more likely to be abbreviated." "But," said my friend, "these are painful subjects to con- template, let us now look into the future. Raise the glass again to your eye, with the silver band still next to you, and observe well what you see. Bear in mind that you   AT THE OCEAN OF ETERNITY.     87 now occupy the stand point of the year of our Lord, 1860, and that your view will be a retrospective one, embracing the decade terminating at that date. For although the glass by reversing the ends, will show you the future, it is more satisfactory and easier understood, to refer to his- tory in the past; and we accomplish our object of viewing future events, by occupying a stand point ourselves, still further in the future, and looking back at what will have happened when we arrive at that date. Any explanation therefore, that I may make to your inquiries, will be in language of the past tense, and have reference to the de- cade terminating at the point of time which you are sup- posed to occupy." I did as directed and lo! the whole nations of the earth were spread out before me. I saw cities and towns, fleets and armies; all in such boundless numbers, that it was impossible to distinguish one country from another, or to understand the objects or intentions of the vast assem- blage that appeared before me. My friend now relieved Ie by observing, "I know your embarrassment, return me the glass." On my handing it to him he merely touched a small spring, which I had not before seen, and returning it into my hand said, "look again." I raised it to my eye when all things before me now appeared clear and dis- tinct, the objects greatly enlarged, and the intentions and motives of the actors in the vast panorama before me, seemed plain and manifest. After I had gazed a few moments my friend observed, "You can now learn the events that are to take place in any country you may choose, for the ten years ending in 1860. Say what country you will contemplate, and ask for any explanations you may need, to a perfect understanding of what you see." With- out hesitation I named the United States, and raised the.   88      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. glass to my eye. Immediately the whole United States and all the Territories thereof, were spread out before me like an immense map or panorama, on which I could see cities and towns, railroads and telegraphs, lakes and rivers-on which were ships and steamers-plantations and fields, teeming with crops and fruits in abundance. I could see the grain fields and fruits, the herds and droves of ani- mals, and the various other products of industrious hus- bandry of the north, middle and western states, while in the south I saw the whitening fields of cotton, the luxuriant crops of sugar cane and rice, and all the elements of greatness and wealth. Throughout the land manufac- tories on a mighty scale were springing into existence, and commerce spreading her wings to the four quarters  of the earth. The white laborers of the north seemed happy in their independence, and even the sable sons of the south appeared cheerful and contented in their bond-  age. From foreign lands a constant stream of hardy emigrants were continually infusing new force and energy into the vitality and industry of the country, and causing the wilderness to bloom and blossom like the rose. Surely thought I, this is the chosen land of Deity, where human- ity is destined to attain its greatest perfections, and where the goodness of God is to be made most manifest to his creatures. My friend, who read my thoughts, now interrupted me saying, "Your conclusions are just and natural. If there is any land or country on the face of the earth, where Divine wisdom has lavished its blessings without stint or limit; where man has everything necessary to his enjoyment, furnished to or within reach of his hand; where, if it were possible to his corrupt nature, he could be happy, that land and that country is surely the United   AT THE OCEAN OF ETERNITY.     89 States. But in looking further into futurity, which we will not do to-day, you will learn how recklessly and wickedly many of these blessings will be cast away, and war, with all its horrors and distruction, be preferred to the smiles of peace; and instead of wealth and plenty, which you now see, poverty and hunger, death, murder and rapine, will stalk over the land-all the work of an ungrateful and wicked generation of men." My friend now took my arm and we again rose into the air, and as we proceeded, the same darkness came over me that there did in the morning, and when light returned I found we were approaching the place of my lodging, with which I now began to be somewhat familiar. Before parting with me this evening, my friend observed that "to- morrow will be our Sabbath, and if it is agreeable to you, I will call for you early, that you may witness the first ceremonies of worship of our people, which take place before breakfast." Of course I assented to this, and after a few minutes further conversation he took his leave. After supper I again took a seat in the veranda, to enjoy my nectar and the contemplation of the beauties around me; but do all I could, I could not separate my thoughts from the scenes I had witnessed through the day. The features of my father and mother in their dying moments-though I tried to reason myself into the reali- zation of the truth, that what I saw was but the shadow of a reality which had passed many years before, and that they were now happy-and above all the appearance of my poor deluded wife, with the thought of the misery she must have suffered before resorting to the fatal poison, and the still further reflection of her present degradation, and probable future punishment-all, all would obtrude themselves upon my memory and imagination, in spite of everything I could do to keep them off.   90       THE MOaNK - vin n, .. .v.- CHAPTER XIII.

IT was aRain late into the night before I retired to my * bed, and even when I did my thoughts and dreams were occupied with the same subjects that were predominant in my mind the day before. Early in the morning my friendiled-uton me, as he had promised, but found me up and ready to receive him. Without any delay he took my arm, and in the usual man- ner we ascended to the top of a considerable elevation, approaching almost to a mountain, on which was a beau-  1 ifiul enclosure or park, which I judged to contain some fifty acres. The walls or fence surrounding this inclosure were composed of the most brilliant shrubs and flowering trees that I had vet beheld, and throughout the area of the rrounds were magnificent shade trees scattered, as if by   SABBATH IN PARADISE.       91 chance and accident, which, as well as the outer walls, were festooned with gorgeous flowering vines. All through the grounds and among the trees were serpentine walks and avenues, inl complete order, over a surface gently undulat- ing and covered with a verdure as soft and even as a car- pet. Near the center of the park was a fountain, whose crystal waters shot into the air, as it appeared, some eighty or a hundred feet, falling back into a white marble basin about two hundred feet across. On the water in the basin were a number of aquatic birds and water fowls, of bright and variegated plumage, and beneath the surface could be seen numerous fishes of rich and varied hues, sporting in all the wantonness of life and pleasure. Interspersed among the trees throughout the grounds were smaller fountains, yielding constant streams of pure cold water, and near them hung suspended from the bodies of the trees gold and silver drinking cups of exqui- site workmanship, from which the people as they passed partook of the crystal fluid. Near the central fountain was an altar and pulpit, raised some ten feet above the surrounding level, built entirely of gold and precious stones; and to prevent the glare of light which would naturally be reflected from such bright and burnished objects, a veil or curtain of fine gauze was hung before them, which without obscuring their beauty or grandeur, tempered and softened it to the eye so as to prevent anything like pain or uneasiness to the beholder. Still back of this was a dais or platform, with silver railing, which I afterwards discovered was for instrumental musicians. Before the altar as well as from the bodies of the trees, were suspended numerous pious texts and mottoes, se- lected from the Old and New Testaments, the Alcoran, 92      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. and other works on devotion and the duties of man, and from the writings of ancient philosophers such as Zoro- aster, Socrates, Plato, and others. These texts were of a devotional or moral character, and made no reference to creeds or systems of religion. Though it was quite early in the morning when we arrived on the grounds, we found a vast concourse of peo- ple already assembled. Some were sitting on the grass, some were walking about, single or in small companies, some were drinking at the fountains; while others were singing in groups und% the trees. For a few minutes people continued to arrive, some on foot, some in car- riages, while a great many came sailing through the air, without any apparent effort, as my friend and I had been in the habit of moving, until the whole space within the enclosure, or at least most of it, was occupied. A venerable looking man, with commanding form, and pleasant, agreeable features, now ascended into the pul- pit, and just as the sun arose, which it did in great splen- dor and beauty, he addressed the Throne of Grace some- what after the fashion practiced in the world below. His manner was extremely dignified and impressive; com- manding unqualified attention from every eye and ear in that vast assemblage. Though soft and musical, his voice seemed to reach all parts of the enclosure, and to be filly understood by every person in it. The invocation or prayer was short-not occupying more than five or six minutes-when, on the speaker taking his seat, the whole audience, with a numerous band of instrumental perform- ers who had now ascended the dais, broke out into the most angelic and heavenly music that it is possible to conceive of. In fact, there is no comparison by which I can convey an idea of the beauty and richness,--the swell   SABBATH IN PARADISE.      93 and cadence,-of those angelic strains that charmed my enraptured senses. This music was sung to the words of a hymn or anthem of praise and thanksgiving to God, that seemed to proceed from the heart of each and every person in that vast throng of people. No coldness or apathy was apparent in any one, but all seemed to be deeply interested in, and to exquisitely enjoy, the exer- cises in which they all took a part. On the conclusion of the singing a short discourse was delivered from the pulpit, which was neither a sermon or lecture, but rather a congratulation, to all present, on the happiness which they enjoyed, and an injunction for grat- itude and thankfulness to the Great and Good Author of all their blessings. The speaker now took his seat, when there immediately pealed forth another strain of music, but now in different time and of more exciting measure. Instead of the deep, rich notes of an anthem, there sounded forth the more stirring refrain of a march; but with the same immeasur- able superiority over earthly music as that already so faintly described. In the performance of this music the audience did not join, the strains and sounds of the instru- ments were alone heard. Directly the whole people formed in procession and marched, or rather promenaded, through the grounds, keeping time with the music. After this exercise had continued some time, and the circle of the park had been accomplished by the whole audience, they quietly and orderly took their places around the altar, when another anthem was sung, equally enraptur- ing as the first, a benediction was pronounced, and the audience was dismissed. Instead of the crowd and haste to get out, which usually follows the dismissal of an audience in the lower world,   "     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. here all was quiet and gentleness. No impatience was manifested, no hurry or rush indulged in; but all seemed quiet, contented and happy, many seeking the drinking fountains, from which they partook of the sparkling waters. Intermingled with the rest of the audience were many children of both sexes, ranging in age from infancy to youth, and from youth to maturity, dressed in cleanly but not gaudy attire, and without any apparent effort to outdo each other in splendor or gaiety. After partaking of the cool waters of the fountains, at the suggestion of my friend we now returned to my lodg- ings, where we found spread a luxurious breakfast, with a liberal supply of the indispensable nectar. And here it may be proper to observe, that this beverage, so univer- sally partaken of by the inhabitants of Paradise, was only calculated to cheer and enliven, but in no degree to in- ebriate or paralyze the faculties of those who indulged in its use. My friend, who had never before sat at table or broken bread with me, now took his seat opposite me, and after invoking a blessing on the food before us, partook of the viands with an appetite and earnestness that would have done no discredit to a hearty, laboring man in the world of flesh and blood. While at table, and as we progressed with our meal, he seemed disposed to comment on the mode of worship in Paradise, and compare it with that in the world below. "Originally," said he, "the Christian Sabbath was devoted on earth not only to worship, but to pleasure and amuse- ments, and the conversion of the first day of the week into a Holy day, for sanctimonious observances exclusively, is a perversion of its original intent-is opposed to the de- sign of the Saviour-of modern invention, and without the sanction of the old or new scriptures. Here," continued   SABBATH IN PARADISE.       95 he, " we adhere to the original objects of the day. These are the worship of, and thanksgiving to the Great and Holy God of the Universe and of Christ his son;-the re- laxation from labor, and the enjoyment of amusements and pleasures, which are in part the rewards that are be- stowed upon us. The dogma propagated as part of the Christian faith, that the observance of the first day of the week as a sanctimonious Sabbath is the most essential requisite to a holy life, and that such observance is indis- pensable to salvation, has Veen productive of great evil to the cause of religion among the children of men. Keeping the Sabbath, as it is called, is often substituted in place of vital piety, and by many thought to supercede the necessity of all other Christian duties; while large numbers regard its infraction as an unpardonable sin; and when they find themselves guilty of this offence-which in childhood and youth they are all likely to be-they lose all hope of Di- vine reconciliation, and become desperate in their wicked- ness. The error of Christian teachers is in confounding the laws of God, as delivered to the Israelites-a perverse and stiff-necked generation, brutalized by four hundred years of slavery, and requiring the severest discipline- with the milder and more human rules laid down by Christ his son. "It is to be noted, that in nearly every instance where Christ speaks of the Sabbath, which was the seventh and not the first day of the week,* it was in excuse for, or in extenuation of its infraction. And neither He, nor any of his Apostles, ever enjoined the observance of the first day of the week as holy time. When asked by the ruler what he should do to inherit eternal life, Christ answered: * See Matthew, xii, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5; Mark, ii., 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27, and iii., 4, 5 and.6; Luke, vi., 1 to 10, and xiv., 2 to 5; John, v., 8 and 9, and ix., 2 to 16.   'Thou knowest the commandments, do not commit adul- tery, do not kill, do not steal, do not bear false witness, honor thy father and thy mother.' * Thus showing, nega- tively at least, that he did not regard the observance of the Sabbath, even by the Jews, as among the most essen- tial of their religious duties. The object of the Saviour seems to have been to rebuke that people for the hollow- ness and formality of their religious observances; and ! without attacking directly any part of their creed which had been sanctified in their estimation by superstition- and tradition, he covertly and indirectly exhibited to them the greater importance of vital piety. That a rest from labor and abstinence from business at least one day in i seven, is promotive of health, morality and civilization, is ! most true, and the error lies in invoking the obligations of religion to the enforcement of a strictly secular duty. X It would be well for Christian teachers to look into and understand this matter, if they would not misrepresent the injunctions of their Divine Master." As my friend proceeded he seemed to warm up and be- come eloquent on his subject. "Indeed," he continued, "there are many who believe and teach that all amuse- ments or pleasures, whether on Sunday or any other day, are sinful and opposed to religion; seeming to forget that upon all the works of nature, whether animate or inani- mate, God has impressed the laws of beauty, happiness and pleasure. The promulgation of such moody and sat- urnine doctrines has done much to divest Christianity of its charms, and sent many souls to .perdition. The young should be taught that they can have both religion and amusements; and not, as too many teach, that they can * Luke, xvili., 18,19 and 20.   SABBATH IN PARADISE.       97 have religion or amusements, but not both; and as they must have amusements they forego religion. "In the breathing and beautiful world, filled as it were with the presence of Deity, and fragrant with incense from a thousand altars of praise, it is time the idea should be done with that God delights in the sacrifice of blood or the misery of his creatures." Our breakfast being now concluded, we retired to the veranda to indulge in our nectar and enjoy the melody of the numerous birds and harps that always seemed to be present. I now asked for an explanation of how it was that human bodies which seemed to possess both substance and gravity, could pass through the air without any appa- rent exertion, and without any seeming danger of falling to the earth.  The answer of my friend was, that as he had observed before, "new bodies are furnished here to the souls of the blest, possessing other and additional powers, facul- ties and senses, than those possessed below; and that one of these powers is to divedt their bodies, and whatever they may have their hands on, of gravitation, during their pleasure. This faculty enables them to rise and descend, or pass through the air, simply by the force of volition. As your experience shows you, the laws of gravitation are the same here as on earth; and as the people you see -:' have substantial, material bodies, subject in this respect to the laws governing other matter, it becomes necessary in order that they should be able to ascend into the air with ease, that those laws should be suspended for the time being, and their bodies divested of gravity. Hence Divine wisdom has given them the power, which they can exercise at pleasure, and with as much ease as they can walk on the face of the earth. Other powers and senses     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. are also given them quite as important, but hih you acould no more omprehend from description than a man bld fro  m his birth .could understand the tints of the rainbowdian it           s Pr."posed b The day having passed meridian, it was proposed by my-frend, that we should again visit the place of the morning's worship, to witness the happiness of the people in their Sunday afternoon's amusements. On arriving at the enclosed' par, e found the people assembled there in great numbers. Butnow, instead of the staid manner and demeanor of worshiP, all was Jchanged into hilarity and mirth. Amuents of various kinds were being indulged in through all parts of the grounds. Some of the younger portions of the company were running, playing and romp- ing, others were pitching quoits, rolling the ten-pin balls,  playing at foot ball, or other athletic and active exercises; while the elder and more sedate were engaged at chess, draughts, dominoes and other sedentry enjoymen ts. The children and youths appeared to enter into the sports of the day with unwonted zest. Among them I noiced many of the sports and amusements common in the world below, when I was a boy. The boys had their tops, their balls and kites; while the girls were busied in picking flowers, making bouquets, tending their dolls, and other juvenile amusements, wellknown and recognized through- out the civilized world of childhood. But among all this mighty throng, not one word was heard, and not a gesture seen that indicted or denoted anything else than enjoyment, pleasure and happiness. No anger or impatience, no rude answer or repartee, no charge of unfairness in play, or insinuations calculated to wound or injure the feelings of others--all seemed to be "nfuenced by a sincere desire to exercise the greatest infl'nced    SABBATHk' IN PARADISE.    99 politeness, and to render each and all unqualifiedly happy. Even the children seemed not to be governed by the capriciousness of childhood, but-to exercise only love and kindness to their playmates, and mutually strove to pro- mote each others enjoyments. It was, indeed, a sight that saints and angels might contemplate with approbation and love. All this time the fountains throughout the park were playing in unusual volume-the jets and streams being directed in such a manner as to form pyra- mids, arches, festoons and other fanciful designs in great variety and indescribable beauty; while the aquatic birds in the basin, and the airy songsters in the trees, filled the ears of the multitude with the sweetest of melody. Among all this hilarity and mirth the more substantial comforts were not wanting. Interspersed throughout the grounds, tables were spread with the choicest viands, accompanied by the luscious nectar, of which all partook when, and as often as their appetites prompted them. In the meantime my friend and I strolled among the people, apparently unnoticed, helping ourselves to such refreshments as we fancied, and for myself, highly. enjoy- ing the scenes and objects around us. During the whole of the day the sun was shining through a soft mellow haze, rendering the temperature most agreeable and pleasant, while the atmosphere was sweet and balmy, loaded with the fragrance of the surrounding flowers, and imparting strength and vitality to every living creature. As the day waned and the evening drew nigh,'a signal note from a bugle brought the whole company to momen- tary silence, when they immediately began to fall into line of eight abreast, and keeping time to a spirited mili-   tary march, promenaded through the grounds. The length of the procession was far greater than to reach around the park, but with a system, which all seemed to under- stand, and which very much resembled the evolutions of a cotillion, it passed through the various avenues, pre- senting what appeared to me inextricable confusion, until all at once, as if by chance or accident, it formed an im- I mense circle around the central fountain. A numerous band of musicians, who had already ascended the dais, now struck up the music of an evening hymn, which was joined in with by the whole company, and sung to words of worship and thanksgiving. On the close of the hymn the band changed to a march, then to the lively notes of a cotillion, then again subsiding to a march, under the inspiring strains of which the procession again moved, passing out of the principal gate, when the exercises and amusements of the day were at an end. The crowds of people now in families and groups, slowly and quietly sought their homes, while my friend and I, falling in with the moving throng, proceeded on our route to my lodgings. As we passed along, which we now did on foot, he again reverted to the different modes of observing the Sabbath in Paradise, and in the lower world; "Here" said he, "we have no occasion or disposition to harrow up the fears of the people, by describing to them an eter- nal hell of torments, neither do we think that such de- scriptions, among the sons of men, are calculated to pro- mote piety, morality or happiness. They may excite fear and outward show of religion, which instead of real piety and love for the Deity, is simply deception and hypoc- risy; and while the world may be imposed upon, the   Great God of the universe reads the inmost hearts of men, and weighs and measures every action." On arriving at my lodgings, we found the table already spread, and our evening meal awaiting our return. On taking a seat with me at the table, my friend observed, " this day I have devoted to your society and instruction, and will not leave you until you wish to retire. With you, time may obe important, as you still have a work to accom- plish on earth, but with me the works of time have passed, and I have now entered upon eternity. After a rather protracted meal, we took our seats as usual on the veranda. Tile full orbed moon was just rising, and tile numerous stars began to bespangle the hleavens: and here I would remark, that from the extreme purity and tran- sparency of the atmosphere, especially during the night, in this land of the blest, the heavenly bodies-sun, moon and stars-assume a different appearance from that in the nether world. Instead of the flat surface there presented to the eye, as if they were painted upon the firmament, here they seem to stand out in relief, exhibiting their spherical form, detached as it were, from the bluearch of heaven." After a short silence my friend resumed his remarks, and especially referred to the appearance of those hea- venly bodies. "These," said he " are beautiful to contem- plate, and seem indispensible to our existence, whetherin Paradise or in the lower world; for what would man be without their cheering and vivifyilg influence? And con- idering that the sun is the great fountain and dispenser of heat and light, through the world, it is not surprising that man in his early and uninstructed condition, should h ave directed his adoration and homage to that luminary. Accordingly we find that among the first. religions of  102     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. which we read, was that of the worshipers of the sun. But with our increased intelligence that teaches us to look beyond those heavenly luminaries, to their Great Author and supporter-and to reflect that all these, the work of  his Omnipotent hand, and millions of others not visible to the naked eye-that their number, in fact, is without limit-are inhabited worlds, to which the just are des- tined in succession to reach, and on which to spend an eternity of bliss, we are lost and overwhelmed in wonder and admiration, at the boundless power, and love, and goodness of our Heavenly Father " "Why! Oh, why should God have created man or any other beings What object had he to accomplish,in call- ing them into existence and for that matter, why should there have been a God at all? or space or time, or eter- nity, or anything else in the universe, or in fact a universe itself?" "Although our minds and intellects are vastly enlarged here, tfom what they were in the world of flesh, still there are many things which we cannot yet comprehend. We know that we are happy; that we are in the care and keep- ing of an All-wise, an All-powerful and beneficent Father, and that we must wait patiently on the wisdom and good- ness of that Father, for further developments of our intel- lects, and enlargement of our minds, until we can better understand both Him and His works. What the great plan and intention of Deity may be in regard to man, we can only infer; but it seems probable, from what we already know, that we shall continue to progress in wis- dom, understanding and happiness, through all eternity, and still not reach entire unqualified perfection." My friend now arose to go, but before taking leave he proposed another goblet of nectar, observing "that this prpsd-    SABBATH IN PARADISE.      103 would close the labors of the day, and that on the morrow we would take a farther view into the events of futurity." Although I had many questions to ask in explanation of what I had seen and heard during the day, yet in con- sideration of the lateness of the hour I concluded to defer them to another opportunity. I wished particularly to enquire whether the ceremonies and amusements we had witnessed were universal and uniform throughout Para- dise on the Sabbath, or whether the people of each local- ity regulated and managed these matters to suit them- selves. My friend now left me, and as I was somewhat fatigued I retired to bed and soon fell asleep.   104       THE MONK OF THE MOUNTANls i CHAPTER XIV.

TIE labors and fatigues of the previous day, together with the liberal potations of nectar I had indulged in, disposed me to sleep, and it was broad daylight in the morning before my slumbers left me. It was in fact the first night's real sound sleep that I had enjoyed since my arrival in Paradise, and I felt much refreshed and re- cruited from its effects.   toilet and dispathed my I lad just completed my toilet and dispatched my breakfast, when my friend called for me. As usual, his manner was kind and familiar, but sufficiently dignified to show that he was of a superior nature, and had an im- portant mission to fulfill. After the customary salutation and a few common-place remarks, he proposed that we should immediately proceed to the business of the day. As, on former occasions, he took my arm, when we again rose into the air, and as be- fore passed into a region of darkness; and jhile this dark-   THE GREAT REBELLION.      105 ness continued I partially lost consciousness, and cannot, therefore, say which direction we took, or how long we remained up. As we emerged into light, and my senses returned, I found that we were approaching the same point of land from which we had taken our observations into past and future events on the former occasion. We now alighted and took our former position, when my friend produced his telescope or magic glass, observing, "you will now bear in mind that you are looking retro- spectively from the year of our Lord, 1870, and the events of-the previous ten years will pass in review before you. In addition to sight you will be aided to understand what passes before you by other senses, and if there should still be anything which you do not understand, ask and I will cheerfully give you information." On raising the glass to my eye I observed that the same scenes of peace, beauty and plenty that I had before con- templated were still there, but they remained only for a moment. Immediately a dark cloud covered the land from ocean to ocean, like a mighty pall, hiding every ob- ject from view, and relieved only by momentary flashes of sulphurous lightnings, whose lurid blaze served but to render the darkness more visible. Rolling thunder, rush- ing winds and rattling hail served to complete the awful scene of confusion and dismay, and render the whole earth one fearful Pandemonium. At length, in the par- tial intervals of the terrible storm could be seen hosts of armed men in the array of battle; and in the lulls of ele- mental strife could be seen the flash, and heard the roar of artillery, the charge of horse and infantry, and the bloody carnage of the battle-field, impelled by the brutal pas- sions of men. This scene changed often, sometimes roll- ing away to the south, then again surging to the north;  while in the breaks and intervals of the storm could be  seen burning cities, sinking ships and smouldering ruins, throughout the length and breadth of the land. The smiling landscape and busy scene of contentment and happiness had all vanished, and in their places were des! olation, ruin and despair. The corpses of men slain in battle and starved in prisons were strewn over the earth, and the horrid feetor of the battle-field contaminated the sweet air of heaven. Mourning for lost friends, weeping and wailing, were in every house, and the whole nation was clad in the habiliments of woe. At length the clouds seemed to break away, and light shone again over the world. The winds were hushed, the thunders ceased to roll, and the strife and tumult of the battle became silent. Nature again put on her smiles and loveliness, and seemed to be anxious to cover up and hide the ravages of war. A few only appeared to brood over their misfortunes, and pine in sorrow at what they regarded a most humiliating defeat. Among all the rejoicings for the return of peace, no e  appeared to be more sincere or indulged in more heartily  than that of the sons of Africa. They, whose sable hue had for centuries subjected them to unrequited toil and servitude, found themselves unexpectedly freed by the contest, and at this consummation they rejoiced with ex- ceeding great joy. I turned to my friend for explanation, though the ob- jects of the war and nature of its results were manifested, to a great extent, by what I had seen and heard. In an- swer to my enquiries he said, "You have seen merely the outline, or shadow, of one of the greatest rebellions that have ever afflicted mankind. It occurred during the first' half of the last decade, and the effects of its disasters are   'TIL UJKAT llEBA" It;BlLLIU)N. . lIV not yet obliterated from the land. With the suppression of this rebellion has fallen the last remnant of African slavery on t North American continent. A great loss of human life and an immense sacrifice of property have been some of the incidental effects of the struggle; and although to individuals and families the misfortune has been incalculable, to the nation at large-its future pros-, perity and greatness-and to mankind throughout the world, it has proved the greatest of blessings. , The des- truction- of African slavery and of the arrogant aristoc- -racy, which is one of its fruits; the elevation of the Amer- ican character in the estimation of other nations; and the great impulse that has been given to enterprise and in- dustry throughout the land, have 'already proved, and will continue hereafter to prove, far more than an equal com- pensation for all the sacrifices that have been made in the gigantic struggles of the war. Let us now," said he, "4 see what has taken place during the remaining years of the decade under consideration. "Since the close of the war a great increase has taken place in the emigration from other countries to this, which is now regarded as the land of the greatest promise on the globe. The resources of the country n orth and south, east and west, hh e been rapidly developed; agri- culture, manufacturing, commerce, mining, and all other enterprises, have progressed in prosperity with unwonted success; while the wealth and enterprise of other lands have been poured into this in the greatest profusion. The wars which have been prevailing and threatened in Eu- rope for the last few years, have no doubt contributed in a great degree to bring about these results. During this decade difficulties and embarrassng questions have arisen between the United States and other governments, but                 \    10S     THE MONK OP THE MOUNTAINS. they have all been arranged by negotiation or deferred to other opportunities. Now raise the glass to your eye and see whether you discover evidences confirming what I have told you." I did as directed, and everywhere I saw prosperity, peace, plenty and happiness. New towns and cities, especially in the west, were springing into existence, while those of former date were being improved and en- larged. Agriculture, manufacturing, mining and other enterprises, seemed flourishing on land, while the ships of commerce were increasing and multiplying on the waters. "Yes," said my friend, seeming to know what was pass- ing before my eyes as well as what subjects were occupy- ing my thoughts, "the country is in a truly flourishing condition, and is indeed blessed in all the elements of greatness, power and happiness. The census now being taken will show a population of over forty-four millions of inhabitants.* "Here," continued he, "let us close the labors of the day, and at some future time we will resume them at the point where we have left off. I can enable you to see one hundred years into the future of your country, from the period at which you commenced, but further than that the power of the glass does not extend. If at any time you should grow weary of this investiga- tion you have but to say so and we will then cease to prosecute it. To-morrow I propose to show you your father and mother, believing that you will now be able to command your feelings so far as to restrain any improper indications of your presence while in their vicinity." He now took my arm, and we returned to my lodging in the same manner and under circumstances of darkness, * The reader should bear in mind that this prophesy was made in 1850, but con- sicdered retrospectively from the stand-point of 160O.   THE GREAT REBELLION.       109 and partial insensibility, on my part, the same as took place in the morning. On arriving at my lodging and taking seats in the ver- anda, as the day was not fully spent, I now took occasion to ask my friend whether the practices throughout Para- dise were uniform among all nationalities, especially as to the forms and ceremonies of the Sabbath day. His answer was, "There are no tyrannical rules enforced here in anything. People do pretty much as they please in all things, only abstaining from interfering with the rights and privileges of others: and this we regard as true lib- erty. The good sense of each individual, enlightened as it is in this life, is a safe guide to instruct him how far to go; and by restraining him within proper bounds, insures his own as well as all others' enjoyments. "Nearly all the unhappiness in the world of flesh results directly or indirectly from the folly and ignorance, or vices, and indiscretion of men; and one great exhibition of folly,is in the disposition to overdo all things relating to and governing their own actions and conduct. Legis- lators amplify too much in law-making, seeming to forget that man will often do voluntarily what he cannot be forced into by coercion. There is too much preaching and theoretical morality aqd religion in the world; less precept and more example would better fit men for the duties of life and for the exigencies of death-too much praying, especially when, instead of asking for direction and assistance, it is attempted to idictate to, and instruct God what He shall do, and how He shall conduct Himself under particular circumstances." "If man in all situations and under all conditions would learn to respect the rights and opinions of others, and to abstain from interference where he had neither interest  nor authority, the world would move much more smoothly, and life would pass with far more pleasure and satisfac- tion. The vices and indiscretions of men too often sap their constitutions, destroy their health and abbreviate their lives. If man since his creation, had lived in accord- ance with the laws of nature, old age would come upon him like the drowsiness of the evening, and he would pass from life to death-from earth to Paradise with as little pain and anxiety as he now falls asleep. In direct answer to your inquiry-we have no laws here governing the forms of worship or amusements on the Sabbath, or any other day." Miy friend now took his leave, and after a light supper which was immediately brought in, I retired to my bed.    CHAPTER XV.

"My mother at that holy name Within my bosom there's a-gush -Of feeling, which no time can tame, A feeling, which for years of fame I would not, could not crush." -Morrics, AT the end -of the last chapter I had taken my supper and retired to bed--but not to sleep. The thoughts of see- ing my father and mother, after so long a separation, so engrossed my mind that all disposition to sleep seemed to be banished from me. Whenever I closed my eyes they stood before me, as they appeared when I last saw them. My father with care and anxiety for the fate of his family which he was leaving, for an'unknown time, and my mother in sickness, sadness and despair, at the thought of the condition of her helpless children that she was about, to part from forever in this world. I saw my wife and her seducer. I saw my wife's father and mother, and the friends and companions of my youth- and early manhood. I again in imagination, crossed and recrossed the Atlantic ocean, and reviewed the whole of my mercantile career of prosperity and adversity. Again the long and lonely   "2     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. years of my hermit life -in short every event through which I had passed since my earliest recollection-seemed to present themselves before me. My present condition, so strange and mysterious! so out of the course of nature, and so uncertain in its results! all weighed upon my mind and oppressed my spirits to such an extent, that the night had almost passed away before I fell asleep, and after I  slept my thoughts were still tossed and distracted with feverish drearis, so that when I awoke I found myself unrefreshed and uninvigorated by my nights attempted repose. As this was the first morning since my arrival in Fara- dise, that I had not awoke from my slumber with almost the freshness and elasticity of youth, I could not but feel some uneasiness, that even in this land of bliss, there was some exception to perfect health and happiness. On the arrival of my friend he noticed my wearied look, and remarked that as long as I wad encumbered with a mor- tal body, I must be subject toLhe laws of humanity and decay; that true, while I was in Paradise, I was less likely to suffer from the ills that flesh is heir to, than when in the world below; still I could not expect entire exemp- tion from pain and solicitude, until the gross portions of my nature had been purged from my existence, in passing through the dark valley of death. After that I should no more feel pain or uneasiness, or suffer from weakness or decay in any form. This information re-assured me, and to a great extent restored me to my wonted cheer- fulness and serenity of mind. At the suggestion of my friend I drank an extra glass of nectar, in which he joined me, and soon after we took our departure. Contrary to our former practice, we now rose high above the earth, almost, as it were, to the usual attitude of the   HS FATHER AND MOTHER.     113 clouds, and without any apparent exertion, sailed through the upper region of air with the rapidity of an eagle. The country below us appeared like a vast map, on which we could distinguish lakes, rivers, and mountains; forests, fields, cities and towns; with all the clearness we could have done, had we been passing over a rich and highly cultivated country in the lower world. Indeed, the land- scape below us presented a view of beauty and variety rarely seen, except in highly wrought pictures, or excited dreams. After sailing in this manner over an extent of country of which I could form but an imperfect idea, we began to descend, and soon reached the earth in the vicinity of a beautiful city on the side of a mountain. Here we took seats under a wide-spreading tree, and beside a fountain flowing with the purest of crystal water. From a silver cup, hanging by a chain of the same metal, we allayed our thirst, and then disposed ourselves to rest and to await the coming of those we expected. While sitting here, I had time and opportunity to observe the appearance of the inhabitants, who were going and coming, stopping to drink at the fountain, and chatting with each other on the most friendly and familiar terms. None of them seemed to see or notice us, for as at all times heretofore, while mingling among the people, my friend, by a power he possessed, had caused us to be invisible to those around us, while we could see and hear all that passed in our vicinity. We had not remained long in our situation at the fountain, before a family group of persons, both male and female approached us, but as such companies were frequently passing, and as there was nothing peculiar in the, appearance of the one now coming, I paid little atten- tion to them, until they were within what might be con- 7  sidered speaking distance in the world below. I now, for the first time, saw and recognized my father, and imme- diately after my mother. With them were a fine looking young man and beautiful young lady, who, from the moment I saw them, I knew to be my brother and sister. Whether that knowledge was from any family likeness on their part, to my father and mother, or from instinct or a supernatural power that had been given me, I cannot say, but certain it is that I had no doubt of the fact, though their appearance had entirely changed since I had seen them; my brother having died in infancy, and my sister, a deformed and helpless invalid, having died in early girlhood. My father appeared as a man of about thirty years old, active and elastic in movements, with the evidence of happiness and contentment in every lineament of his fea- tures. His whole carriage and manner were those of love and kindness to the persons around him, but with a dig- nity and self-possession that clearly indicated him" as the head of the group. He was not greatly changed from what he was in life, when I last saw him, and although somewhat younger in appearance, I should have had no difficulty in recognizing him, even if I had met him unex- pectedly. My mother, on whose loved form and features I had gazed after life had departed, more than seventy years before, and whose cherished lineaments were still fresh in my memory, appeared altogether more beautiful than when in life in the world of flesh. Her appearance was that of a woman from twenty-two to twenty-four years old. Her form redolent with health' and spirits, and her features lighted up and animated with smiles and cheerfulness, truly heavenly and angelic. "In every move- ment of her person or limbs, in every expression of her   beautiful features, or in the modulations of her musical voice, could be recognized nothing but contentment,hap- piness and love. Her age al the time ofher death was about thirty or thirty-two, and though the change that had taken place in her appearance was very considerable, still her general features and carriage were so similar to those in life, that I had no difficulty in recognizing her at once. Though her form was round and faultless- and her features smooth, youthfnl and rosy, there was still something in her manner and expression, that clearly indicated that she was a wife and a mother. My brother whom I had seen in his helplessness and infancy but for a moment, had grown to manhood and strength. His appearance was that of a man of from twenty-one to twenty-three years old; his form erect-rather above medium height- full, robust and hearty. His manner to my father was kind and deferential, to my mother gentle and loving, and to my sister patronizing, kind and encouraging. But of the whole group none attracted more of my attention, or enlisted a greater interest than my sister. She, the poor delicate, deformed, crippled girl, over whose early death I had almost rejoiced, so many years before-in whose removal to a purer and better world, I then thought I recognized the wisdom and goodness of God-now stood before me, in all the pride of maidenly beauty, and in the loveliness of virgin purity. Her age seemed about eighteen, of medium height, straight and erect, and in every movement showing ease, grace and loveliness. Altogether, the family before me presented a picture of beauty, happiness, purity and love, that I had, never seen in the lower world. My father presented to my mother a cup of water from the fountain, and after drinkinghimself, gave the cup to  my brother, who filled it and gave it to my sister, anc, after helping himself, they all took a seat under a wide spreading tree, within a short distance of where We sat. I thus had an opportunity of gazing at them for some tinme, marking their movements, and listening to their conversation. Asmay well be supposed, this was a trying moment on my resolution, for do all I could to control my feelings, my yearnings to address them, and make known my presence, were almost irrepressible. More than ever I longed for the time, when I could be divested-of this mortal body, and in a rejuvinated form, take my place in the midst of my family, where without fear or appre- Iension for the future, we could together enjoy unal- loyed happiness, throughout the endless ages of eternity. My friend, who seemed to read and understand what was passing in my mind, observed that "the time will soon come, when your wishes will be gatified, but in the meantime, you have duties to perform in which mankind are interested, and which will be indicated to you as events progress. It is enough for to-day, that you have seen all that I promised you, and all that you can now profitably investigate. Let us niow return to your lodg- ingrs, where you will be able to reflect upon and consider what has been exhibited to you." As I was debarred from all intercourse with those who were so dear to me, it was with a mingled feeling of plea- sure and pain that I departed from their presence. I could not but feel pleased that I had seen them in a condi- tion of such happiness and contentnent, and at the same time I experienced an unsatisfied craving and desire for a more intimate and familiar intercourse. Without waiting the departure of my friends, we arose into the air, as we had done in the morning, and pro-   weeded in the direction of my lodgings, which were becom- ing quite home like and familiar to me. Our departure from the fountain attracted no notice from my family or from the crowds that were constantly coming and going. Indeed, it was evident that they neither saw or heard us, but were entirely unconscious of our presence. The fact that we could go and come among crowds, without being seen or heard, at first seemed quite strange and unnatural, but I had by this time, become so accustomed to it, that I could mingle with the people, with a full realization that while I saw and heard all that was transpiring, I myself remained 'invisible. Our passage home, as I shall call it, occupied about the time that our outward passage did in the morning. We distinctly saw the varieties of country, and movements of the people, that we did then; in fact, if I had not known to the contrary, I should have supposed that we were passing over a well settled and highly cultivated portion of the lower earth. As we sailed through the air my friend pointed out the various localities occupied by people of different nations, for, said he, "although all languages are spoken here, and readily understood by all, still there is a decided disposi- tion with the people of each nationality, to live and asso- ciate together-especially is this the case on their first arrival in Paradise." My friend accompanied me to my lodging, but made only a short stay, simply observing, that he would call at the usual time in the morning, and then we would again look into futurity. He seemed to know what subjects were occupying and engrossing my mind, and that I could take but little interest in any other that might be intro- duced; hence, with the kindness and consideration which    "8     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. he at all times manifested, he hastened to leave me alone, and to my own reflections. After a hasty evening meal, in which I took small satis- faction, my mind being still with my family, I retired to my room, but again I could neither sleep or rest. Do all I could, I could not forget the scenes of the day; whenever I closed my eyes the vision of my father and mother seemed to stand before me. That father and mother whose loved features, a separation of so many years had not obliterated from my memory, now with renewed beauty and renovated strength, had been restored to me. That brother on whose infant existence I had been permitted to look, but for a moment, as it were; and that sister on whose helpless deformity I had gazed with sympathizing sorrow, and whose early death I had regarded as a Provi- dential blessing to her and her friends; are now brought before me in all the perfection of early man and maiden- hood, clad in smiles, in happiness and love! Could this be a reality? was I indeed awake, or was it but a flatter- ing and deceitful dream, from which I must soon be aroused to a consciousness of my dreadful and lonely condition? These thoughts and reflections haunted me late into the night, and though less unhappy than on the night previous, still the intensity of my thoughts was such as to prevent sleep, and to weary th  rather than to restore it to vigor and strength.   A GREAT WAR.  CHAPTER XVI. IS SHOWN THE EVENTS OF THE DECADE ENDING IN 1880-SEES A MGHTY WAR BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGLAND--CON- QUEST OF IRELAND-OTHER NATIONS BROUGHT INTO THE CONTEST -SEES A GREAT NAVAL ENGAGEMENX--FINAL RESULT OF THE WAR.

IT was near daylight when I fell into a disturbed and feverish slumber, from which I was awoke by my attend- ant, who announced that my breakfast was awaiting my pleasure, and that my friend had already made his usual call. After a hasty toilet and equally hasty breakfast, I joined my friend, whom I found in the veranda enjoying the shade of the over-branching trees, the music of the birds, and the sweet odors of a morning breeze. Here we con- versed a few  noments on vyrious topics, when without further delay we set out for the shores of that mysterious   120     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. ocean where coming events to the nations of the earth had been, and still were promised to be unfolded to my vision. On presenting to me the wonderful telescope, my friend observed, "You will now bear in mind that you are look- ing from the stand-point of 1880, back through the vista of the decade preceding that date." As I raised the tube to my eye the first objects that presented themselves were immense hosts and bodies of armed men hurrying forward in the haste and bustle of war, and engaged in embarking on board a fleet of trans- port ships, which appeared to be drawn up to receive them. And while these ships extended so far that the extreme limit of the fleet could hardly be embraced by a single sweep of the eye, they seemed none too numerous to transport the mighty cohorts concentrating in their neighborhood. From east and west, north and south, the numerous legions continued to arrive, crowding'to reple- tion every avenue, road and other thoroughfare for a great distance throughout and around that part of the country. The whole nation, indeed, seemed to be alive with one exciting, common object, and that object ap- peared to be a preparation for war. As one ship after another received its living cargo it was taken in tow by an awaiting tug-boat and hauled into line with other ships already filled, and placed under the control and protection of iron-clad steamships and moni- tors that appeared to be equipped as convoys for this im- mense fleet of transports. The embarkation of this innumerable host appeared to occupy many days, and to engross the attention of the whole nation; but at last it was completed, and the entire fleet, convoyed by the numerous iron men-of-war and   A GREAT WAR.        121 monitors, seemed to get under way and to stand out on the bosom of the broad Atlantic. As they did so the whole ocean appeared to be covered as far as the eye could extend with those interminable appliances and para- phernalia of destruction. As they disappeared in the distance I turned to my friendly monitor and enquired what meant this mighty hostile demonstration, and to what point was this arma- ment directing its course? His answer was that this .was "an army made up mainly of the natives of Ireland and their immediate descendants, who are now about to un- dertake the recapture of their country; and this expedi- tion is intended as a demonstration, hostile to the govern- ment, but friendly to the people of that island.'? He continued: "About the commencement of the decade which you are now considering, a war broke out between your country and England, brought about by the influence of the Irish population in the country, joined to the recollection of wrongs and indignities, real :nd imag- inary, which had been received from that nation; and what you have -been considering is one of the many efforts of that war.. "Immediately after the declaration of war Canada was taken possession of by the armies of the United States, but with so little exertion of force and strength on the part of the invaders, and so little resistance on the part of those who were invaded and conquered, that I did not deem it worth our while to exhibit it to you. The expe- dition for the invasion of Ireland which you have been witnessing, was planned and undertaken in the latter part of the second year of the war, and called together a large proportion of the Irish population scattered over the American continent, and many from the various countries   122     THE MONK OF TIE MOUNTAINS. of Europe. Even England herself furnished large num- bers of recruits to this immense army. Now raise your glass again and I will show you another scene in this drama of blood, that produced important influences on the final result of the contest." As I did so, the almost interminable armada that I had before seen getting under way, was again spread out to view, but now, instead of leaving the land it appeared to be approaching the western shores of Ireland; and while the fleet kept steadily on its course, I could see that all was bustle and activity on board the ships, in evident preparation for landing. Instead, however, of making a direct line to the western coast, the armada bore to the north as if seeking a harbor on the north side of the island. At length, as I gazed upon the exciting scene, a new party appeared upon the tapis, and for a time appeared to threaten quite a complication in the proceeding. This was no other than a numerous British fleet composed of iron-clad men-of-war and monitors, who seemed to be sta. tioned there for the express purpose of throwing obstacles in the way of such hostile demonstrations. This brought the convoy ships of the American fleet to the front, who, forming in the shape of a crescent, with the concave side to the enemy, steamed forward to the attack. Maneuvering now commenced on both sides, and neither of the fleets seemed disposed to engage in the actualities of battle. The object of the American commander ap. peared to be the safe landing of the large army on board the transports, while that of the British admiral was to prevent such consummation. It was plain, from my point of observation, that the American was outgeneraling and getting the weather-gage of the Briton; for while the former was diverting the attention of the latter by his   A GREAT WAR.         123 feint of attack, the whole fleet of transports, led- by a small number of iron-clads, tacked about and rapidly re- traced their course, until reaching a harbor which was unguarded by shipping, and but weakly defended by shore batteries, they boldly assaulted the place, and after a short but most deadly struggle, carried the works and took the garrison prisoners. The work of disembarkation now commenced in earn- est, and soon the army had gained the land and was spread out in preparation of battle for many miles in the interior. It was evident that this army of invasion intended to make their stay a permanent one, as they brought with them great quantities of spare arms and ammunition, and such other supplies as might be needed in their occu- pancy, and in the arrangement of the affairs of the coun- try. As soon as a few regiments had obtained a landing a system of entrenching and fortifying was commenced, and almost immediately, as it seemed, every hill and emi- nence looking either to the harbor or the interior, were bristling with cannon and alive with armed men. When the whole army was disembarked and the numerous cohorts spread out over the land, they seemed like the locusts of Egypt, prepared to devour every green or liv- ing thing in the country. Their necessities had, however, been foreseen and provided for, and as soon as the men and their arms were safely landed, numerous store ships laden with provisions were brought into the harbor, from which supplies were landed sufficient, as appeared, to feed and clothe one half of the human race. While all these things were going on, the numerous troops stationed on the island under the cross of Saint   12 4     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. (;eorge, were not unobservant or idle. As I swept my glass over the country I could see that vast armies were marching, countermarching and concentrating, with an evident intention of disputing the progress of the invad- ers throughout every inch of their march. Not only was this comnmotion observable among the troops already on the island, but large re-inforcements were constantly arriving from across the Irish Sea, swelling the British army to a size and magnitude unprecedented in the his- tory of that nation. On the other hand, large numbers of the native Irish population were fleeing to and ranging themselves under the stripes and stars and green flags of the invaders. Here they were armed, organized and drilled, and incorporated into the ranks of those they seemed to regard as their friends and deliverers. In the meantime the American fleet of transports and war ships leaving accomplished one of its objects, ap- peared to separate and take different directions, the trans- ports singly and in snmall squadrons seeking their homes but without convoy, while the armed ships bore away and sought positions in the Irish Sea and St. George's Channel. Their object in this, as was perfectly obvious, was to intercept, capture or destroy the re-inforcements crossing from the English side. But here they were again met by the same fleet that they had menaced on the other side of the island, greatly augmented by new accessions, and a decisive naval engagement seemed for a time almost inevitable. As this, however, appeared not to be the object of either of the commanders, the operations of the two opposing fleets consisted more of maneuvers and changes of position, for the purpose of cutting off any stragglers from the line of their opponents, than to bring on a decisive and final action.   A GREAT WAKR         125 While these things were progressing the two hostile armies were not idle upon the land. The invaders, after a short but active preparation, and having been increased in numbers by the great addition of the native popula- tion, began to move on their course of offensive warfare. City after city, and fortress after fortress, yielded to their superior numbers simply on demand, without any resist- ance, until it seemed likely that I the whole island would be subjugated to their rule without firing a gun. But as they neared the more densely inhabited portion of the island, where the English population and influence were in the ascendant, the evidence of intended resistance be- came more striking and palpable, till arriving in the neighborhood of the city of Dublin, where they found ex- tensive fortifications and a large army stationed to dis- pute their advance. Here, then, the appliances of war on a mighty scale-were first brought into use, and after a most sanguinary contest, in which many fell on both sides, victory at length perched upon the standards of the invaders. This was in part, at least, as I could see, owing to the defection of a number of regiments of Hindoo troops, who had been transported from the East to aid in defense of the country of their conquerors. In the heat of the engagement all these troops, as if by preconcerted arrangement, changed their colors and went over to the enemy. The decisive character of this victory appeared to deter- mine the fate of the island. Nearly the whole British army were surrendered as prisoners of war, and disarmed by their conquerors.  I now addressed my friend for a more full explanation of what I had been witnessing, who in answer to my en- quiries, said: "You have seen merely the outline of part Xt   126     TIIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. of the first act of the greatest war that has taken place in modern times, and perhaps since the creation of the human race. Your observation only extends into the third year of the conflict, that continued nearly through the whole decade which you are now considering. "Immediately after the great battle of Dublin, which you saw, and the fall of Ireland into the hands of the American forces, additional parties were brought into the contest. Both France and Spain were induced to take sides with England, while Russia espoused the cause of the United States. This gave the contest a world-wide extent, and lighted the fires of war in the four quarters of the globe. The field of operations were so wide and the continuance of the struggle so prolonged, that it would too much distract your mind to attempt to contemplate the whole of this sanguinary strife. It is enough for you to know that untold numbers of human lives were sacri- ficed; that widows and orphans were multiplied through- out the world; that property beyond computation was destroyed; and that civilization, intelligence and religion were caused to retrograde for generations. "As the last scene in this terrible drama was a naval conflict fought between the ships of all the contending par- ties, in the North sea, off the mouth of the river Thames, and as the result of this action was the arbitrament on which the war closed, and a final peace was agreed upon, I will cause a panoramic view of the conflict to pass before you. "The circumstances that conspired to bring about this battle were the great numbers and power of the ships composing the combined fleets of the United States and Russia, their demonstration to invade the shores and har- bors of England and France, and the determination of   A GREAT WAR.         127 those powers, with all their combined naval forces, to defend their possessions. "Never before were there such mighty fleets brought into hostile array, nor such extensive preparations made for the slaughter and destruction of man; and never was a battle fought on land or water, that produced such im- portant results to the nations of the earth: raise the glass to your eye."-' Immediately there was presented to my astonished view one of the most magnificent spectacles that the world has ever gazed upon. Spread out for many leagues in every direction, were the war ships of the belligerents- those mighty leviathans of the deep from whose terrible broadsides death and destruction were about to be hurled through the' ranks of their mutually opposing enemies. There could be seen the various flags and:banners of the different nations engaged in the conflict, to inspire their men to the work of slaughter, and make them forgetful of their own danger. The stars and stripes and eagle of the United States, with the battle-cry of "remember British neutrality and French justice!" floated from the flag-staff of every ship of the Great Republic. The double eagle and cross, with "remember Sebastapol," were the flag and battle cry dis- played from the ships. of the colossal Empire' of the ' North. While the ships of the new Republic of Ireland floated the green flag and harp of Erin, with the battle- cry of"Robert Emmet, 'tis time his epitaph was written!" The red cross of Saint George, the lion and union jack of Great Britain; with the banner of "'Brittannia rules the waves." The tri-colors and the eagles of France with "God and our Country;" and the cross of Spain, with "Christ and the holy virgin," were the several flags and   128s     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAIN S battle cries floated from the ships of those respective nations. The first day of the engagement appeared to be mostly occupied by the hostile fleets in maneuvering for position; each party striving to gain the advantage by concentrat- ing as much force as possible upon a given point, and that point being one or more of the largest of the oppos- ing ships. Ver few of the vessels carried masts or sails, nearly all depending upon steam or other artificial power for their propulsion. Flag-staffs from the stem and stern, or amidships, were the only hamper that appeared above the decks or turrets. At length night set in, and then appeared one of the grandest exhibitions of the contest. From the tops of every flag-staff and turret, were dis- played lights whose brilliancy would almost have paled the mid-day sun. The whole ocean as far as could be seen appeared one mighty chandelier of lights, so vivid and powerful, as hardly to be borne by the naked eye. And now the battle commenced in earnest, each ship being propelled with the greatest force upon its antagon- ist, while belching forth from its monster guns the mis- ;iles of death, and dealing havoc and destruction in every quarter. The crimson tide spouted from the scuppers of every deck, and the sea soon became dyed with the san- guinary flood. Many vessels were run into-some over- whelmed and sunk into the deep-some with all hands on board, while from others a portion would escape to be tantalized with hope, and perhaps to suffer a more pro- longed death. A few succeeded in reaching other ships, thus avoiding immediate destruction, to be again exposed to the same dangers, and perhaps again to pass through the same bloody ordeal. The saturnalia and carnival of death still went on, and   A GOEAT WAR.        129 it seemed that the total extermination of one or other of the contending parties would alone terminate the desper- ate struggle. But now a new element appeared in the contest. Some twenty of the largest of the iron-clad ships, with the stars and stripes flying from their peaks, and which up to this time had stood aloof from the battle, bore down into the melee, exhibiting a determination to run into and sink all opposing-objects; but on a passage being opened in their opponents' line, who seemed thus to have defeated their designs, they opened their ports and sent forth streams of liquid fire, that covered the decks of their enemies in one sheet of flame. They also hurled forthhhollow metallic globes, of immense size, filled with oils and other com- pounds of the most inflammable nature, which on striking a vessel or even the water, exploded, communicating flame to everything combustible, or spreading over the'surface of the water, forming an ocean. of fire. At the same time submarine boats, towing torpedoes filled with the same inflammable compounds, penetrated below the enemy's  shipping, where the torpedoes were exploded, sending up columns of fire and water many hundred feet into the air, and overwhelming the largest ships, as if they had been egg shells. These inflammable compounds had inter- mingled with them, noxious and poisonous drugs of the most deadly character, and as they burned they sent forth fumes and gasses, the simple inhalation of which pro- duced immediate stupor and in ensibility, and ultimate death.  The streams of liquid fire communicated flame to every- thing combustible with which they came in contact-even the clothing of the officers and men-literally roasting them alive at their guns or on the quarter-deck. 8         r   130      TIlE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. From this new and terrible warfare the boldest seamen fled in dismay, but in escaping from one danger only encountered others still more horrible. On his own ves- sel he was sure to be overtaken by death in the most awful form, and on plunging into the ocean he found him- self literally in a sea of fire and subject to equally horrid destruction. Two or three of these fireships themselves blew up, destroying all on board, but the remaining number, as if disregarding the fate of their comrades, kept on their course, carrying torture, death and devasta- tion to all within their reach. The British, French and Spanish ships now attempted to escape, but in this most of them were as unfortunate as in the previous part of the engagement. The pursuing fire-ships possessed much the greatest speed, and without any regard to disparity of numbers, dashed forward, fol- lowing up their infernal warfare, until the whole com- bined fleets of their enemies were taken, sunk, or des- troyed. The result, therefore, was that before meridian on the second day of the contest, the whole coasts, rivers, and larbors of bo h England and France, with their cities and towns, lay open to the attacks of their enemies. It is true, those rivers and harbors were fortified and defended, but against this new mode of warfare, and an enemy flushed with so recent and important a victory, their for- tifications and defences were of small account. A demonstration was immediately made by the victors toward the river Thames, but before any new acts of aggression were committed, an unarmed vessel approached bearing a flag of truce from the English commander, when a signal from the American flag-ship arrested further hos- tile movements.   A GREAT WAR.        131 I now turned to my friend for explanation, who in answer, rather to my thoughts than words, said, "You have seen the faint outlines and shadow of the greatest naval engagement that has probably ever been fought on the earth. This battle is known as 'The Battle of the Thames,' having taken place as you have seen, off the mouth of that river. The small vessel bearing the flag of truce, which you saw, bore also a delegation from London, asking for a suspension of hostilities, until terms of peace could be agreed upon. It also brought a commissioner from the English government, admitting that their cause was lost, and throwing themselves upon the mercy of the conquerers." "It required but a few days to arrange terms of peace between the belligerent natiqns, subject to the ratifica- tion of their respective home governments. The terms agreed upon as preliminary to a final peace were: lst.-That hostilities should cease in all parts of the world as soon as intelligence could be communicated to the forces engaged. 2d.-That Great Britain, France and Spain should pay to the conquerors two hundred and fifty millions pounds sterling, towards defraying the expenses of the war. 3d.--That the independance of Ireland and Canada should be recognized, and a Republican form of government guaranteed to them by the high contracting'parties. 4th.-That Great Britain should cede to the United States all her West India, South and Central American pos- sessions, and the island of Malta in the Mediteranean sea. That she should cede to Russia all her American territory on the north Pacific coast, to extend east to the hundredth degree of west longitude, and the Rock and fortress of Gibralter.   13 2     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. 51/.-That France should cede to the United States all ler West India possessions, and to Russia her Colony of Algeria. ;t/h.-That Spain should cede to the United States the island of Cuba, and all other possessions she had on the western hemisphere. All fortifications, arsenals, arms, ammunition, and other lublic property, situated on any of the ceded lands or territory, to pass with the same. The whole of British North America, except that portion ceded to Russia, to be annexed to and belong to Can- ada." On my expressing the opinion that these were hard Termns to b1e imposed upon a conquered people in these mlodern times, my friend replied, "They certainly seem so, but when we reflect that nearly all the possessions tliat have changed owners on the close of this war, were obtained by conquest, and held by the strong hand, we s11all see that the taking them is simply despoiling the ro1ber of his prey. They were acquired by the sword, lleld by the sword, and there can certainly be no impro- priety or hardship in their being lost by the sword. It is merely an exhibition of retributive justice, showing that, though the laws of God are sometimes slow in their oper- ations, they are always sure in their results. The one hundred millions of pounds sterling of the indemnity money, which was appropriated to the restoration of Ire- land, was but an inadequate compensation for the six hundred years of robbery and slavery to which she had been subjected by the English nation." I asked my friend what was the cause moving the na- tions to this terrible conflict? His answer was, that "the causes were numerous and complicated, at least ostensi   A GREAT WAR.         133 bly so, but the real grounds were fewer and more simple; they were the fear and jealousy entertained by monarch- ical governments of the growing strength of thre great western Republic, and the popularity of liberal principles among their own people. The increasing numbers and influence of the Irish population in the United States, as I have heretofore informed you, brought on the war be- tween England and that country, and the other parties to the contest were drawn in, one after another, by supposed interest and policy, or by sympathy with those already en ga',ged. "As we are now near the end of the decade terminat- ing in 1880, I need only inform you that the population of the United States is over sixty millions of souls. This closes the labors of the day, and we will now return to your lodgings." So saying, he took my arm, and as on former occasions, we reached the hospitable veranda, when my friend soon taking his leave, I despatched- my evening meal and re- tired to my room and bed.   134       THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.

AT tie usual hour in the morning my friend called and proposed this day to take me to a part of the couniry, and a situation, where I could have a better opportunity of seeing the people at their employments and amuse- ments, than had yet been afforded me. As on former occasions we arose from the earth and passed through the air, at a height that enabled us to enjoy a full view of the country beneath us, and to distinctly observe the employments of the people, and readily understand their objects and pursuits. The country itself was much as heretofore described, full of beauty, variety, and objects of interest.  As in other directions we saw cities, towns and hamlets, villas and plantations, present-   THE GLACIER.         135 ing the height of artistic improvement and beauty of embellishment. Fields and forests, alternating in such a manner as to present the finest variety and most charm- ing scenery. After sailing for some time through the middle stratum of atmosphere, we approached a mountain of considera- bly higher altitude than I had before seen in Paradise; so high in fact, that on nearing its summit I observed it to be whitened with snow. This somewhat, surprised me, as my previous observations-had shown me that we were in a region of perpetual summer, and I was not aware that we had rose high enough to so greatly change the temperature and climate. The sides of the mountain from its base, to near the region of frost and snow, I observed were in the highest state of cultivation and improvement. Vinyards and orchards from the plain upwards succeeded each other, and presented a variety and richness of fruits nowhere to be found in the lower world. As our course lay up along the elevation of the moun- tain, we could plainly see the gatherers of grapes, engage I in their work, and hear their songs of happiness as they deposited the luscious fruit in its receptacles. As we ascended the mountain we passed over a pastorial region where we saw immense flocks, and herds of animals, under the charge of their respective shepherds, herdsmen and keepers. These latter extending almost to the verge of vegetation, and approaching the border of snow which capped the mountain; altogether presenting a succession of employments and productions, the most pleasant and grateful to the beholder. On arriving on the summit of the mountain I discovered we were approaching a frozen lake, or glacier c' manv   1 3      TILE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. leagues in extent, situated in a hollow, or depression of the mountain, very much like that of an immense extinct volcano. The ice on the surface of this lake was as even, a11l smooth as a looking-glass, and was covered with counitless numlbers of people of both sexes, engaged in the amiusements and pastimes known in the lower world lduring the winter season. Every nation seemed to be here represented in its amusements. The universal skater, both male and female, were skimming over the glassy sur face of the lake in glee and enjoyment so general, where ever this amusement cal be indulged in. The boys and girls in joyous merriment, riding down the surrounding declivities and hill sides, while the games and sports of the various nationalities, were provoking shouts of hilarity and laughter in every direction to which the eye or ear could be directed. Among the many other sports and pastimes. I readily recognized the game of curling, of my OW\1 Scottish highlands, and the shinney which was com- mon when I was a boy in the land of mn, adoption. My friend, who had been unusually taciturn during the morningl, now addressed me as follows, "What you wit- ness before you we denominate 'the festival of the gla- cier.' It is held at no fixed times or periods, but only when the ice on the lake is known to be in proper condition. Here people come from all sections of this part of Para- lti-e, to enjoy for a season those sports and amusements at which they have been accustomed in the world of flesh. These mountain glaciers are universal throughout Para- dise, and have no doubt been placed there by our Heav- enly Father, at proper distances from each other, in order to give variety and zest to our enjoyments." At the suggestion of my friend we now took a stroll among the throng of delighted people, to witness the   THE GLACIER.         137 pleasure and happiness that seemed to pervade the im- mense crowd. Along the shores of the lake or glacier, at short intervals, were situated substantial buildings, in which were tables spread with all the luxuries and dain- ties, so liberally provided at every place of public assem- blage, that I had seen in Paradise. These buildings were warmed by unseen fires, which rendered the rooms of most pleasant aid agreeable' temperature, and adapted the air to those who were resting from their exercises. In them, and around these tables were gathered great num- bers of the people, eating and drinking, without money or price, and seeming to enjoy themselves in the highest degree imaginable--aid while out of doors, on the gla- cier, and the hill sides, all seemed mirth, hilarity and hap- piness, within equal enjoyment appeared to abound. Occasionally the sweetest of music, both vocal and instru- mental, would burst forth from some inner apartment, when the whole audience, or crowd of people would join in the chorus, producing the richest chords and most enchanting harmony. As on other occasions my friend and I mingled with the throng, and helped ourselves to such refreshments as we fancied. In fact, every one seemed to do the same, with- out let or hindrance, and without any compensation being offered or expected. i And I would here observe, that dur- ing my stay in Paradise I saw no evidence of purchase or sale, or the use of money in any transaction. All seemed to be free and in common, every one partaking of or ap- propriating to his own1 use, such articles as he fancied. All the necessaries and even luxuries of life seemed to be in the greatest abundance, and of the purest quality. "Here," said my friend, "you have another evidence of the goodness of our Mker in providing for us other /.    1-3S'    TIIE 1MONK OF TIE MOUNTAINS. means and varieties of amusement, to avoid the satiety that would result from a limited number of employments. In fact, you will here find a much greater number and variety of pleasures and amusements than are known in tlhe world below, as all the people of the earth here pur- sue and enjoy their different national pastimes." While walking among the crowds of people, and admir- ing the high degree of rosy health which they all seemed to enjoy, I enquired of my friend how it was, since mate- rial bodies were furnished to the disembodied spirits, and individuals again became indued with senses and other attrilutes of humanity, that sickness -and pain are not sulfered here as in the nether world?"Sickness and pain," replied he, "are but the consequences-of derange- ment or decay of some of the organs of vitality. Man in his physical formation is but a complicated machine, and while all his parts are in order and unimpaired, he is in health and suffers no pain; and it is only when some of this machinery becomes deranged, clogged and out of order, or worn out by long or improper use-the normal organlization deranged or destroyed-that pain, sickness, and old age take place-producing death, or in other words, rendering the tenement uninhabitable by the im- mortal soul, when it seeks another habitation. Here, on the contrary, decay and derangement are un- known, everything tends constantly to improvement and perfection. Here, as I have before informed you, the old and helpless-the crippled and deformed-become young, normal and vigorous, while the young and helpless increase in strength and stature, until they arrive at perfect growth and maturity. The consequence is, that pain and sick- ness, old age and death, are never known or suffered. When the time arrives for our translation to other and   THE GLACIER.        139 more exalted spheres, dissolution of our material bodies is not necessary, our souls and bodies are no more parted, but are wafted by the will and fiat of our Heavenly Father, to regions of our future abode, and our homes of higher bliss." After spending most of the day among the crowds of happy people, and when we were about to take our departure, whom should I meet, but the father and mother of my wife, who were enjoying themselves on the ice among the crowds there assembled. The appearance of my father-in-law was greatly changed since I parted with him, and yet I had not the slightest difficulty in recogniz- ing him in a moment. Instead, however, of the old gray- headed man, bent with age and sorrow, with whom I had been so familiar, and whose friendship to me had been so true and unwavering, I met a young, robust, erect and cheerful-looking person, whose step was active and vigor- ous, and whose whole appearance was a personification of health? contentment and happiness. His wife, my mother- in-law, who was leaning on his arm, appeared like a woman of about twenty-five or twenty-sik years old, round and plump, and as straight and active as a maiden of eighteen-she seemed in high health and most joyous spirits, which struck me with surprise, from being in such marked contrast with her condition when I knew her in the world of flesh. Her age at the time of her deatl must have been in the neighborhood of sixty-a confirmed invalid-and of especially unhappy temperament. She rarely admitted any company to her presence, except her immediate family connections, and never visited out-and notwithstanding my relationship to her, through my mar- riage to her daughter, I could hardly claim anything like intinmate acquaintance with her. Whether I should have   1 40     TIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. recognized her if she had not been in company with her husband, I consider doubtful, still, after my attention was drawn1 to her, there was an indescribable something in the expression of her features, and general carriage that brought her former appearance forcibly to my recollec- tion and left no doubt of her identity. As my meeting with these old and honored friends was so sudden and unexpected, as to take me entirely by sur- prise, I was so far thrown off my guard as to extend my 1:n1il and attempt to speak to them; when my friend Frank, who was near me, immediately placed his hand over my mouth, and with a gentle " hush," hurried me away. In a moment all was dark to my vision, but I could feel that we were rising into the air, and passing forward with rapidity. Directly I felt a drowsiness or stupor pass over me, and soon I lost all consciousness, as I had fre- quently done before when passing through the air with my friend. How long I remained in this state or what distance we progressed, I am entirely unable to judge, but on regaining my sight and senses, I found everything changed and different from what I had seen in Paradise. I now found mnyself in a lonely grove of tall and sombre forest trees, from whose limbs were suspended festoons oi m1oss, and whose trunks were clothed in litchens, render- ing it almost as dark as night. My friend was still at my side, and in solemn speech, though kindness of manner, he gently reproved ne for my forgetfulness, asking me if I did not remember the injunction he had laid me under, to abstain from all intercourse or speech with those might meet, and to hold no conversation with any except himself and the attendant who served me at my lodgings. Adding again, that to all others both he and I were invisible, and that while I was in the flesh of the   THE GLACIER.        141 lower world, no intercourse whatever could be had with the people of this, except by especial permission. In great contrition I acknowledged my error and pledged myself not to repeat the offence. As the day was now far spent my friend proposed that we should return to my lodgings; when taking my arm as usual, we soon reached the familiar veranda, where after partaking of the ever-reviving nectar he took his leave. My evening meal haying been brought in, I took but a light supper and soon retired to bed, but it was again a long time before I could get to, sleep, for, reason as I would, I could not quite reconcile myself to the mistake that I had come so near committing; and as my friend had not informed me what the consequence would have been, had I carried out my intention, I perhaps imagihed worse results than would actually have happened. At length, however, I fell into a slumber and slept soundly through the night. ",    "2       THE MONIK OF TTHE MOUNTAINS.

IN the morning, as usual, my friend called for me, and proposed this day again to look into futurity, and consider the decade ellding in 1890. Taking my arm as before, we rose rapidly through the air, with all the circumstances of darklness and insensibility that accompanied our former passages; but soon, however, we reached the shores of th:t mysterious ocean where, as heretofore, my faculties were restored to me. My friend now addressed me, and ri   n    here    conteplatin   the progress of "I bring you here when contemplating the progress of tine, talt you may, so far as your finite powers can com- prehend infinity, contrast time with eternity.

When millions of years for each drop of water in the oceans or for each grain of sand upon its shores, shall have passed away, eternity will only have begun. The wisdom, the power and the goodness of God -His care and love for His creatures-will then be as young, as warm and as vigorous as they are now. He knows neither age or decay-neither beginning or ending and his creatures who are permitted to reach and remain in these realms of bliss, will have a being co-ex- istent with His own. "Of how little importance then, comparatively, are the events which we witnessed when we were last here! To the immediate actors and nations engaged in them they were regarded as of mighty import; dispensing glory, fame and earthly immortality to many names made prom- inent by the contest-most of them by accident-little reflecting that all this earthly glory will soon pass away, the names of its possessors be lost in oblivion-even the history of the great war itself be overwhelmed in the vortex of revolutions, and the very existence or names of the nations engaged in it become a matter of dispute and controversy among the historians of the world. Such is earthly fame and glory! But even then, the redeemed and regenerated souls of men, with rejuvenated bodies, will be fresh and vigorous, still improving in their mental and physical organizations, and still enjoying the sweet converse of relatives and friends, through the boundless fields of immensity! "Now take the glass," said he, "and remember that your stand-point is at 1890, and that your view is retro- spective through the previous tel years." On raising the glass to my eye, the Whole earth, as on the former occdasion, seemed spread out before me, but   "4      TIlE MONK OF THlE MOUNTAINS. illtteia of the turmoil and havoc of war that then seemed to encircle the globe, all now appeared clothed in the mliiles of peace. The mighty fleets that were so lately !ealin1g death and destruction to their enemies, were now separating a lll leisurely seeking their own ports in which to re-fit and repair the damcages sustained in the late terrible (olllihct; and although many of their comrades had fallen victim in the awful strife through which they had passed, the survivors appeared in no wise despondent or sorrow- ful; but throughout the whole of the victorious fleets, joy, hilarity and exultation seemed to prevail. On every object of elevation were the flags of the winning nations lillglt'l :and interwoven with each other, as if they were ever thereafter to remain friends anid allies, and by no possibility could become enemies. Oni the land, throughout the countries of the conquer- ors, great rejoicing was everywhere apparent. Especially was this the case in the new Republic of Ireland. That impulsive and mercurial people who had been held in subjection and bondage for more than six hundred years, low- on their deliverance seemed unable to restrain, within reasonable bounds, the exuberance of their joy. The green flag and harp of Erin were everywhere inter- twined with the stripes and stars of the United States, anid with the double eagle and cross of Russia, while on their banners could be read various patriotic sentiments, expressive of their happiness and exultation-- among which were, "Robert Emmett, the martyr of liberty- let his epitaph now be written;" "Children of Erin, re- turn to your homes, the gibbet and the block are no longer triumphant; 7 "The United States of America, the home of the exile, the friend of the oppressed, and the land of the brave and the free;" "Russia, the friend of   REJOICINB OF THE CONQUERORS.    145 justice, the protector of the weak, and the great bulwark of the north." And while throughout Russia and the United States the people were less demonstrative, their rejoicings were equally universal and sincere. They all seemed to regard the results of the contest as the commencement of a new era of greatness, and as the opening of new fields for ex- pansion and glory. The war I observed, had produced the usual conse- quences of such contests upon the habits and opinions of the people. As I brought the glass to bear on the different portions of our country, I observed large numbers of boys from early childhood up to youth and first manhood, under arms and being'drilled in military tactics and evolutions. There was the child of six or seven years old, with his imitation wooden musket, going through the manual exer- cise and company drill, with an earnestness and gravity that would do credit to older recruits; there was the stripling of twelve or fourteen summers, with his light compact fowling-piece, performing the more intricate maneuvers of the field, in battalions, regiments or brig- ades; there were the youths still more mature, verging on manhood-some exercising their field or fortification ordinance, while others were mounted on horseback, as cavalry or heavy dragoons, advancing and retreating, flanking and pursuing, with all the order of veterans, and in all the varieties of position known to those respec- tive corps. After gazing for some time at this interesting exhibi- tion, and wondering at its object,. I turned to my friend for explanation, and asked him if the country was pre- paring for another war through the aid of these infant 9   "6      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. brigades?"These " said he, " are the pupils in the com- mon schools of the country, which have now became almost universal throughout all the States in the Union. Instead of the slavish drudgery of ten or fifteen hours mental study in every twenty-four, which you and I were subjected to in our boyhood and youth, people have dis- covered that diversity in education is as advantageous as in other pursuits of life, and that a division of the time between mental and physical labors, properly alternating, promotes success in both, more than exclusive confine- ment to either. A system of training the youthful mind and body has therefore been adopted, and its observance made obligatory on all, which is calculated to give to every male citizen, a good literary education, besides making him a robust and hardy soldier. So that while every man has an opportunity of fitting himself for any civil employ- ment, he is also given a chance to qualify himself for every military duty, from that of the simple private, to that of the commander of armies. "This system is found, by its variety, and active exer- cise, to enlist the interest and attention of boys, more effectively and permanently than any other heretefore introduced into the schools, besides imparting health and strength, and physical development to the rising genera- tion. Already its influence has become manifest in the robust appearance of the population and the military spirit that pervades the nation-to say nothing of the increase of intelligence." But queried I, will not this system have a tendency to promote and foster a spirit of contention, and a disposi- tion for war among the people; making them a nation of braggarts and bullies?"On the contrary," he replied, its tendency is to make men peaceable and quiet, and to   REJOICING OF THE CONQUERORS.    147 induce them to more fully respect the rights of others. It is not the educated and intelligent, healthy and self- reliant individual that stirs up contentions and plays the gascon; but the ignorant, querrulous, and puny dyspeptic, without either mental or physical force, who feels that lie is held in contempt by his fellow men; that brings about quarrels, war, and blood-shed, both in public and private life. Education, whether mental or physical, or both com- bined, is a peace maker, rendering men more contented and happy with their own lots, and more disposed to abstain from interference with the lots and fortunes of others. The opinion is entertained by many physiologi- cal philosophers that man is susceptible of indefinite improvement in mind and body, merely by a continuance of a judicious system of training and education." Again I asked, will not this general military drilling of youths and young men detract too much from the productive labor of the country?"You forget," rejoined my friend, "that most of the actual physical labor that was hereto- fore performed by man, is now executed by machinery, diminishing to a great extent the necessity of unremitted toil by the people of any civilized country, and especially by the people of the United States,/ where machinery is so universally used. Besides, these military drills are not an every day practice by the youths of the country, but are only required of the younger children, and of the youths while they are obtaining an education. "This system is founded on the theory, that all children are the property of the ate, and that every male citizen should be qualified on arriving at maturity, not only to insure his own support, and that of his family, but also to discharge the duties of citizenship in the support or defence of his country. The obligations and advantages   "8     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. are regarded as mutual, for while the individual aids in protecting the government and property of the state, the government and property qualify him to discharge that and all other necessary duties of life. This system of education has become universally popular throughout the. country, and is being largely imitated in both Russia and Ireland. For as both these governments remain in inti- mate alliance with the United States, they copy as closely after her policy and institutions as the genius of their people will permit. "Again raise the glass to your eye," said my friend, "and observe well what passes before you." As I did so I saw ships, or something in their similitude, passing through the air and filled with people. What, I asked, is the meaning of this aerial navigation, for such certainly is the appearance before me. "In this," he replied, "you are not mistaken. The long sought for power of navigat- ing the air has at last been attained. By a combination of steam and electricity a power has been acquired which has ever heretofore been a desideratum with man, and he can now navigate the air with as much safety, and with far greater rapidity than he could formerly navigate the waters of the earth. A voyage now from one extreme of the earth to the other, is reduced from years or months to days or hours, and at a cost merely nominal when com- pared with that of former modes of travel. These con- veyances are as yet only adapted to passengers, and even for that, can hardly be said to be sufficiently enlarged to accommodate any great number at a time. Whether they can ever be made to attain a buoyancy which will enable them to transport heavy loads of freight or large numbers of passengers, is yet a matter of doubt and speculation." I now asked my friend what effect had all these enlarge-   REJOICING OF THE CONQUERORS.     149 ments of territory, wealth and power of the country, and improvements in arts and sciences, upon the morals and virtue of the people? Are they more moral or religious? more human or tolerant? -In short, have they been ele- vated morally and socially, as well as physically and ma- terially, by the many acquisitions and changes that have taken place in the country "To these interrogatories," said he, "I regret to answer in the negative. From sdme cause or causes, perhaps not those alone to which you have alluded, the morals and virtues of the people are certainly not improving, but on the contrary have greatly deteriorated within the last few years. In fact, it may be said, that true religion and genuine morality have nearly disappeared from the land. The laws punishing polyg- amy have been repealed, or have become a dead letter in nearly all the States of the Union, and a plurality of wives is now rather the rule than the exception. The sacredness of the marriage vow is held in light estima- tion, and infidelity to its obligations in either husband or wife, is hardly regarded as an offence deserving censure or punishment. To correct in some degree this corrupt state of society, various schemes and inventions have been resorted to, which, in most instances, have only in- creased the evil, and demonstrated conclusively that a departure from correct principle cannot be rectified by palliative measures or temporary expedients. "Among the many changes that have taken place in the marriage relation is the adoption of the practice of the ancient Britons, of marrying in circles or communities, which has now become quite prevalent throughout the country.* Objectionable as this plan may be when con- The practice of the ancient Britons here alluded to was this: Five, ten, or even a greater number of men up to fifty, would marry an equal number of   150      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. trasted with the Divine institution of marriage of one man to one woman, where the mutual obligations are ful- filled in fidelity and good faith, yet when compared to the universal concubinage heretofore prevalent, it is regarded as an improvement and corrector of licen- tiousness. Other innovations equally radical have been introduced into the marriage relation, the effects and influence of which are yet problematical. Nor are the darker crimes of murder, arson, larceny, and others of kin- dred character, less rife in the land. Safety to individuals is only secured by armed associations and constant watch- fulness by numbers sufficient to insure protection.. In many instances, the practice pursued in feudal times of castellated dwellings, has been adopted, where by regular watch and ward the inmates can alone be protected." What, I asked, has produced this great declension in human morals, if it is not the increase of territory, the unusual prosperity, and the improvements in arts and in- ventions?"Many causes," said my friend, "have com- bined to lower the standard of morals and religion throughout the land, without attributing it to increased wealth or intelligence; among them may be named the long continuance and magnitude of the late war, which has not been singular in this respect; as all wars are more or less demoralizing upon the people. The great emigra. tion to the country from all parts of the world, bringing with the good and moral, many desperate and unprinci- pled characters-ready to resort to any means rather than honest industry to obtain a living-has. also been a source of immorality and crime. To these may be added a women in common, no one man claiming any particular woman, but regarding all as his wives. And on the other hand each woman regarded every man in the circle as her husband. So that in -fact each man was the husband of all the women, and each woman the wife of all the men.-Walker on Mfarriage.   REJOICING OF THE CONQUERORS.     151 mawkish sentimentality on the part of legislatures, courts and juries, against visiting crime with proper and ade- quate punishment. But of all influences operating in this direction, none has been more potent than the teach- ings of certain schools of religion, that a barren opinion is all that is necessary to secure eternal salvation, and that a death-bed or scaffold repentance of the greatest of criminals, is sure to waft his spirit immediately to realms of eternal happiness. With these and other baleful influ- ences constantly operating, what else can we expect than almost total depravity? "That real, genuine repentance, however late, will not admit the sinner to Paradise, I will not say, but men often deceive themselves and others in this matter, and forget that a mere profession of repentance will not deceive the Searcher of all hearts. Besides, it is not the doctrine taught by the Saviour while on earth. He said, 'for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth: they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation.' * And again, 'the tree is known by its fruits."' t At the suggestion of my friend we now returned to my lodgings, where after walking for some time through the adjoining grounds, conversing oh various subjects, he left me and I retired to my room. * John, chap. v., 28th and 29th verses. - Matthew, chap. xil., 33d verse, '    -  ,   152       THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.

TIIE morning found me much refreshed and invigorated, as I had passed the night in sound, undisturbed repose. I arose early and after my morning's bath and toilet, took a stroll through the garden and grounds surrounding the cottage. The sun was just rising above the verge of the horizon in celestial splendor, imparting to the whole firmament that beautiful aurora which so charmed me on the morning of my arrival in Paradise. The feathered songsters were warbling forth their delightful music from every branch of the overhanging trees, while the unseen aeolean harps gave forth a harmony of sounds inexpressi- bly sweet. All disposing the mind to a deep devotion and heartfelt thankfulness to the great Author of all these blessings. I had just completed my morning meal when my friend made his usual call, and on taking his seat he alluded again   CONDITION OF VARIOUS NATIONS.   153 to the doctrine of sudden conversions and repentance, which had been the subject of his remarks on the previ- ous evening. "It is not to be denied," said he, "that repentance and reformation late in life-even on the death-bed, or the scaffold-if genuine and from real change of heart, may prove effectual in securing the joys of Paradise; indeed we have an instance of it in the case of the thief who was crucified with the Saviour; but this we must regard rather as an exceptional manifestation of mercy, induced by the genuineness of repentance, of which Christ was fully convinced. But the doctrine is a dangerous one to preach, encouraging procrastination and delay, and leading many to suppose that they can indulge in every excess and wickedness through their whole lives, provided they repent any time before death. "The fact is that every act or thought of a man's life becomes a part of his very being, and enters into his men- tal and physical organization. The criminal or sensualist not only exhibits the depravity of his nature in his thoughts and conversation, but the very lines and marks of his features are constant informers on the wickedness and corruption of his heart; and no one act or opinion of his, without a miracle from God, can neutralize or change what it has taken a life time to produce. And besides, until a radical reformation has taken place in his nature and his very soul is purged of its sinful desires, Paradise would be no heaven or place of happiAess for him-so that although it may be well to say, that 'it is never too late to repent and reform,' it is still better to say 'that repentance and reformation never come too early.' My friend now changing the subject observed, " this is the last business day of the week, and I leave it with you whether to tale a tour through the country, to see what   154     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. we can of the inhabitants, their employments, habits and amusements, or to pursue our investigations into the future, on the shores of the great ocean." As I had become greatly interested in the developments of the previous day, I preferred to follow up the investi- gation and learn the future of my country. We, therefore, took our course as usual and soon found ourselves at the place of our former observations. Before putting the glass into my hand, my friend adverted to the moral and physical condition of my coun- try during the decade ending in 1890, which we had con- sidered on the previous day. "At that time you will re- collect " said he, "' that your country was physically and materially in a flourishing condition, but morally and religiously sunk to a low ebb. You will now bear in mind that in our panorama of the future, ten years have passed, that your present stand-point is at 1900, and your view retrospective from that date through the previous decade. At the commencement of this period the United States numbered seventy-eight millions of inhabitants, while they now, at the beginning of a new century, num- ber over one hundred millions, so that notwithstanding the prevalence of crime and licentiousness which was then so notorious, and which I regret to say, yet con- tinues, material prosperity and increase of population still go on without diminution; other causes having conspired to compensate for the deficiency causedby im- morality and vice. "As the nineteenth century has now closed, and the twentieth just begun, it may be proper to look abroad and consider the present condition of the peoples and na- tions of that portion of the globe which we have been   CONDITION OF VARIOUS NATIONS.   155 studying; and especially those having interests in com- mon, or intercourse with your own country. "First, then, of Mexico, whose territory adjoins, or rather did formerly, that of the United States: For since 1880, she may be said to be part and parcel of that coun- try. Although the relationship between the two coun- tries was nominally a protectorate on the part of the stronger, to guard and protect the rights of the weaker, it was in fact, what all protectorates must be, a domina- tion of the strong over the weak, and a monopoly of all advantages resulting from the connection, by the domi- nant party. This has been so obviously the case with these two peoples, that both have become convinced of the absurdity and injustice of the arrangement; and for the last ten years the form of protectorate has beeti abandoned, and a full annexation of the smaller to the  greater country has been consumated. Mexico and Cen- tral America, north of the Isthmus of Panama, now com- pose six States of the North American Union, and are represented in the national Congress. "The nations south of the isthmus, with the exception of Brazil, are now allied and leagued together to defend themselves against the encroachments of that powerful monarchy. On the whole, they are improving in popula- tion and wealth, but their intolerance and bigotry in reli- gion are great drawhacks to their growth and progress. "Brazil now ranks among the great powers of the earth; and though not equal to the North American Union, the liberality and tolerance which of late have governed her policy have increased her population and developed her immense resources with unprecedented rapidity. She is now free. from the incubus of African slavery, and through North American and European emi-   156     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. gration, her population has acquired an energy and enter- prise not usual with the latin races. With all these ad- vantages, and occupying such an immense territory of the most productive lands upon the globe, it is not surprising that she is regarded with the highest respect and consid- eration by the other nations of the earth. "Canada, on the north, after the recognition of her inde- pendence, organized a Republic, and is now managing the affairs of her extensive territory under an elective form of governmlent. Though the apathy of her original inhab- itants, the peculiar organization of her most numerous Churchl, and her inhospitable climate, have retarded her progress to a considerable extent, she is still making rapid strides to power and greatness. Her fisheries are un equaled by any in the world, and almost compensate for her deficiencies in agriculture. Her mineral wealth is found to be almost unlimited, and only equaled in the country of her powerful southern neighbor. Towns and cities are already springing into existence along the sliores of Hudsons Bay and other northern lands, where a few years ago it was thought to be too cold to be inhab- ited. These cities and towns are already becoming great resorts for summer pleasure-seekers, who visit there to enjoy the salubrity of the climate, the excitement of the fisheries, and the sport among the millions of aquatic birds found on these waters. On the whole, the nation is looked upon as one possessing a great future, and likely at no remote day to rank among the first nations of the world. "On the other side of the Atlantic, the first in geo- graphical order comes Ireland. This country since the acknowledgment of her independence, has greatly im- proved, and is still advancing in wealth and population   CONDITION OF VARIOUS NATIONS.   157 Great numbers of her sons and daughters, who had vol- untarily banished themselves from their homes, to all parts of the earth, have since returned to the land of their birth, bringing with them the learning, arts and sciences, with the liberality and toleration in religion, of other countries, without which no nation can rise to greatness. These advantages, with the natural shrewdness and energy of her people, joined to her favorable location on the map of the globe, are fast raising her in the scale of national importance, and insuring the respect of the world. Already her green flag has become familiar in the ports of maritime nations, and her commerce is courted by the merchants of the earth. "England the next in order, may be said to have experi- enced a great revolution since she'passed in review before us. Instead of being the great world encircling nation, -on whose dominions 'the sun never sat,' she has now al- most shrunk to her own island limits. Nearly all her colonies have become independent or have been appro- priated by other powers; her naval superiority has long since departed; her people have become clamorous for an agrarian division of her large landed estates-already her laws of primogeniture and entail have been abolished- and she is fast drifting into the harbor of democracy, or what is hardly more feared by her former privileged classes-upon the shoals and quicksands of anarchy. She is now reaping the bitter though legitimate fruits of her oppressive class legislation at home, and of her policy of conquest and robbery practiced on the weaker nations of the earth, for the last five hundred years. Politically she has lost all prestige, and as a military or a naval power, has sunk to a third or fourth in rank. In manufactur- ing and commerce she is still respectable, but by no   158   THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. means the first on the earth. Rather, in fact, deriving lier importance ani self-consolation from the memories of the past than from the consciousness of the present, or the hope of the future. ' France has again tried a republican form of govern- ment, and this time with much better success than here- tofore. On the death of Napoleon III, during the minor- itv of his son, the nation decided on an elective republic, and are now governed by a President and Congress, modelled after the plan of the United States. "At the death of the last emperor some commotion was manifested, and it was feared that the nation was aiin destined to pass through a revolution of blood; but the majority for a republic was so great, and the expression for that form of government so decided, that an actual resort to arms never took place, and the nation passed i from an empire to a republic, seemingly as a matter of course. She is still regarded as a first class military power, though her naval prestige has never been regained since her great defeat at the battle of the Thames. As a commercial and manufacturing people she has been emi- nently successful, and is regarded as a most prosperous nation. "The greatest improvement and progress, however, made by any nation in Europe for the last fifty years, has been by Russia. This power since her acquisition of ter- ritory under the treaty of London, and of her still farther extension to the Dardanelles, by conquest from Turkey, in 1885, has improved her vast resources and has become one of the greatest naval powers of the earth. Blegsed with a long, uninterrupted peace, and being freed from the curse of slavery, she has educated and elevated the masses of her people, and now occupies the front rank i   CONDITION OF VARIOUS NATIONS.    159 among the nations of the world. The peace and friend- ship between this country and the United States have never been interrupted. Each has pursued its march to greatness without jealousy or hindrance from the other, and whenever contact has occurred between them, the objects have been friendly and co-operative, rather than hostile or antagonistic. And while the republic has ren- dered great and important aid to the monarchy, in the development of mechanical skill, and education,and re- finement of her people, the latter has reciprocated equal advantages to the former in the extensive fields of com- merce opened for the sale of her most important staple productions. "The countries composing the German Confederation are fast tending to consolidation, and as education and intelligence pervade the masses, they are becoming more clamorous for republican governments. In fact the re-  mark will apply to the whole of Europe, that wherever education has become general among the people, king- craft and priestcraft are loosing their power over them, and a firmer determination is manifested to. organize gov- ernments and religions better adapted to the wants, and less expensive to the majorities. "Now take a survey of your own country, and mark its boundaries and extent; its pNfucdts, power and wealth- with its population, improvements and other evidences of greatness." I raised the glass to my eye, and following the direction indicated by the flags bearing the stripes and: stars, traced the boundary from the Pacific Ocean along the Russian and Canadian line to, the Atlantic Ocean; thence south, including all the West India Islands, to the Isthmus of Panama; and thence again along the shores of the Pacific   160     TlE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. Ocean to the Russian line. I saw her ships on every sea, and the richest products of her soil on every land. Her population engaged in their various avocations, numerous apparently as the leaves of the forest. "Here," said my friend, "you see a country blessed with a free and enlight- ened government, and with a contented and happy peo- ple. A country which produces more of the necessaries and luxuries of life than any other on the globe. Yes," repeated he, "The United States produces more grain, more meat, more cotton and wool, and domestic animals, -more wine, more silver, gold and other precious metals; more petroleum, coal and iron; has more extent of rail- roads and telegraph wires-a greater merchant marine and war navv, and a greater number of passenger balloons than any other nation on the earth; and as I before informed von commences the twentieth century with over one hundred millions of inhabitants, and is at peace with all the world. "In the meantime we have seen that a large portion of Europe is clamorous for republican governments. Thrones and Kingdoms are found to be too few to supply all the sciols of royalty with crowns and scepters; while the people have learnd that the trappings of royal courts can only be maintained by taxation and oppression-and that the producers of wealth are those alone among the work- ing classes. With this conviction they have called for a change; and as education enlightens their minds, and systematizes and directs their efforts, their prospects of success are greatly improved. General intelligence and education are incompatible with monarchy, and sooner or later one or the other must yield or go to the wall. "It is evident that the world is entering upon a new   CONDITION OF VARIOUS NATIONS.   161 era, and that the future is pregnant with mighty events bearing upon the condition of man. As the day is far spent let us return to your quarters." So saying, my friend took my arm, and with the usual circumstances we soon reached my lodgings. He de- clined taking any refreshments with .me, but after a few moments' casual conversation, bade me good night and left me. Supper now being announced, I soon satisfied my appetite, and as I was more than usually fatigued directly retired to bed. 10   162      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS, CHAPTER XX.

RATHER earlier than usual next morning my friend called on me, but found me already up and dressed, and at my breakfast. He took a seat opposite me at table, and enquired how I liked the fare that was provided for me? On my answering that I liked it well, he observed that it was somewhat difficult to adapt the food of Para- dise to the grosser tastes of the sons of earth, but in my case the training I had received for the last sixty or seventy years had qualified me to relish common viands. To this proposition I readily gave my assent, and with some other rather light and sportive remarks on the part of my friend, I finished my repast. After helping himself to a goblet of nectar, he pro- posed, as this was the Sabbath, we should vary our obser- vations somewhat, and for that purpose should visit a part of Paradise that I had not seen. "In our route," said he, "we will call at another place of worship than that you visited last Sabbath, which will give you an opportunity of observing with what liberty and freedom we are blessed in this state of existence. We do not think that true reli-   SECOND SABBATH.        163 gion consists in any set phrases of devotion or programme of action; but rather in a pure and joyous spirit, and a free and spontaneous expression of our happiness and thankfulness to God." , We now arose into the air, and sailing rather leisurely, passed over what seemed to me some twenty or twenty- five miles of country. Our elevation from the earth was not so great as to prevent a distinct sight of its surface, and a full view of the inhabitants. Large numbers were seen on their way to their places of worship in all the various modes of travel heretofore described. On reach- ing a rather uneven or rolling country, we alighted on the side of a pretty high elevation facing a beautiful lake, where the people were gathering in the shade of a pleasant grove for the purposes of worship. The grove was not enclosed like that on the previous Sabbath, but in all other respects was quite as tastefully embellished. The fountains and basins of water, the birds and water fowl, the flowers and fishes, were all there, and as the grounds were formed into terraces or walks, in successive elevations, they presented a more charming variety, and to my taste a more agreeable diversity than those I first visited. The size of the grounds was greater than on the previous day, amounting, I should, think, to one hundred or one hundred and fifty acres, with the altar and pulpit near the lower side, and between the audience and the lake. The arrangements for the orchestra were at either side, and not in the rear, as on the former day, and on the whole there was not so great a display of gold, silver and precious stones in the embellishments as on that occasion. The audience was more numerous, the speaking equally good, and the zeal and happiness of all beyond compari- son. The only material difference I noticed was in the   164      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. great predominance of females over males composing the audience, and in the unusual number of children. On mentioning this fact to my friend, he explained the rea- son by observing that this was an English settlement, and that in E1ngland it was well known that the females out- numbered the males, and there, too, large numbers die in childhood. The forms and ceremonies of the day were on the whole so similar to those I had already seen, and have betore dlescribed, as not to require a new description. When the audience was dismissed my friend and I strolled to the shores of the lake, where we saw many persons of both sexes amusing themselves--some in walking along the bank, some in small row-boats, and others-especially children-by casting pebbles into the water. Soon after the middle of the day we returned to the grove, where we found the people re-assembling for their afternoon amusements. The tables of refreshments were already spread, where each one was helping himself at his pleasure; the orchestra was sending forth its most harmonious melody, while mirth, gaiety and happiness seemed to pervade the whole throng. My friend and I mingled with the crowd of people, helping ourselves to such refreshments at the tables as our appetites craved, not forgetting the delightful nectar, which we found in great abundance. As the day advanced and evening approached, we wit- nessed a phenomenon which I had not before seen since my arrival in Paradise. It was nothing less than a shower of rain, accompanied with thunder and lightning. From appearances which I had noticed a few mornings before, I supposed that rain had fallen during the night, but I   SECOND SABBATH.        165 must have been too sound asleep to have heard it. On this occasion I was interested and amused to observe the contrivances, so to speak, of the people to protect them- selves from the falling water. A kind of lotus or large water plant abounded in all the basins and streams in the grove. This plant bore leaves and flowers of enormous size, any one of which would protect a person entirely from the rain. On the approach of the shower, ther tore, each individual covered him or herself with one of these-the flowers descending ov the head and shoul- ders in form of a Church bell ad turnin  e water nore completely than an  thly  ela. In this ar- rangement I observed the ladies all sought for the flow- ers, and as the gentlemen were willing to gratify themn there was quite a pleasant rivalry among the latter to place on the heads of the former this protection, or per- haps, ornament; for although, when regarded singly, these variegated head-dresses presented a rather ludicrous ap- pearance, when seen on the whole company, amounting to thousands, the effect was picturesque and beautiful. However, as the shower was but short, the fun as it seemed to be considered, was soon over, and as the sun again appeared in all its splendor, the people began to separate, and my friend and I took our departure for home. As we proceeded along through the air, my friend remarked, "You see that the doctrine we were taught on earth, that Heaven was paved with gold and walled with diamonds and other precious stones, and that the joys of the redeemed consisted in singing and praising through all eternity, are like many other heresies with which man has been deluded. The former theory was the inven- tion of the miser, who imagined that he could forever   166     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. enjoy the contemplation of riches, though not his own, and that there could be no heaven of happiness uncon- nected with the objects of worldly wealth; while the latter opinion was that of the crazy zealot, who, carried away in the rhapsodies of devotion, supposed that his ecstatic frenzy would continue throughout eternity. The advocates of these doctrines picture Heaven as a mere hamlet, or rather as a Church building, and forget the space that would be required for the millions of souls that pass to their account every year. "The wisdom of Deity has led Him to adopt other ob- jects of interest and amusement for the souls of men. He has provided variety in this world as in the world below; has given them senses to be gratified, loves and friend- ships to be enjoyed, and appetites to be indulged in; but has not afflicted them here with the same lust of riches and longing after wealth, with which they have been cursed in the world of flesh. With no objects of interest but gold and precious stones, and no enjoyments but singing and praising, Heaven would be a place of dreary monotony, and the immortality of the soul the most pain- ful belief that could be impressed on mankind." By this time we had reached the hospitable cottage, and as my friend did not seem disposed to prolong his stay, I soon took my supper and retired to rest.

THS morning, my friend proposed that we should to-day prosecute our investigations into the future to which I readily assented. We soon reached the shores of the ocean without other circumstances than usually attended our flight there, and took our accustomed position. "If agreeable to you," said he, "we will to-day consoli- date our observations, and look at the events which are to transpire during the first twenty years of the next cen- tury. In this way we shall shorten our labors, without diminishing our knowledge of, or weakening the interest in the coming history of that part of future time." On   16S     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. my expressing my assent to this arrangement, he put the telescope into my hand, with his usual caution to remem- ber the date of my stand-point, and that I was consider- ing retrospectively, the two first decades of the twentieth century. On raising the glass to my eye I could see that great changes had taken place throughout my widely extended country. The hills and mountain sides were coveredwith flocks and herds of animals, and clothed in vines and fruit trees to their very summits. This seemed not to be con- fined to any particular locality, but extended from one extreme of the country to the other. Among the flocks and herds I saw many varieties of animals, heretofore unknown or unacclimated in the country. There was the Cashmere goat of the east, the lama of the south, and the camel and drommedary of Arabia the blest, all of which appeared perfectly domesticated and at home. The herds of cattle and flocks of sheep were so numerous as to cover the hills and mountain tops, wherever they were not cul- tivated in vines and fruits. On the plains and more level country were spread out farms and plantations in the highest state of cultivation, and teeming with all the rich and varied products of the temperate and torrid zones; with cities, towns, and villages, swarming with human life and enlivened with industry-all giving evidence of uni- versal prosperity, and unqualified happiness and content- nmet. In glancing along the seaboard of the Atlantic side of the continent, I discovered many cities and towns of which I had before no knowledge, but which had now grown to quite imposing importance, and in the harbors of these,-a well as of the old cities, shipping and water craft seemed to abound in almost countless numbers, all furnishing proof of a trade and commerce in proportion to   "AND OF WASHNGTON.       169 the wealth of the great country of which these cities were in part the representatives. Among all the cities of the east I noticed that New -York still held the lead in size and numbers, but was not the only one exhibiting great evidences of wealth and im- portance, other cities seemed to be contending with her for supremacy and the honor of being the commercial metropolis of the east. In particular was I interested in the miraculous growth and immense proportins which the city of my former residence and home had acquired. Surely the city, or rather hamlet in comparison-of4?hiladelphia of 1785-in which I had spent my childhood, and some of the hap- piest as well as most miserable years of my life, could not be the Philadelphia before me! The land for many miles in every direction, into what was country and even forest at that time, had now become compactly built upon, and was swarming with human life and animation. Pittsburg too, the village with which I had been so much disgusted on account of the disagreeable odor and dirty smoke of her favorite fuel, had become a mighty and flourishing city, numbering her inhabitants by the million, and her wealth by the thousands of millions-the very fuel which I had held in such utter contempt being one great source and element of her wealth. On the Pacific side of the continent the cities had grown still more rapidly than those on the Atlantic side. There it seemed more like the work of enchantment than reality-more like romance and fable than of serious his- tory and matter of fact, in which the welfare and happi- ness of millions were involved. But the greatest increase of population and wealth, both in town and country, was after all, in the central   170     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. portion of the Republic. There the cities were assuming (   those immense proportions, which as the country ad- vances in population and wealth, they are destined to maintain, and presenting a degree of magnificence and grandeur unknown in other lands. Near the center of the country I observed one city of more than usual beauty-laid out in a peculiar manner, and covered with buildings of unprecedented magnitude, The superior appearance of this city was so striking that I askel my friend for an explanation. "This " he an- swered, "is now the seat of government of the United States. After many struggles for the removal of the old seat of government, and still more for the location of the new, both objects were at length accomplished, and a city has been built up where none before existed, which is both an honor and convenience to the whole country. So wedded were the people to the name of the father of his country, that they would listen to no other name than WASHINGTON, for the new seat of the central govern- ment, which they now regard as permanent and perpe- tual." He then pointed out to me the capital, or halls of legislation, the President's mansion, and the various pub- lic offices of the government; with such other objects as he considered interesting or important. There were two edifices, however, situated at the opposite extremes of the city, which he had failed to allude to, though larger and more gorgeously embellished than any of the others, and to these I called his attention, and asked for an ex- planation of their uses. His answer was that " these were hotels or club houses, belonging to the two political par- ties of the country, and occupied by them as their respec- tive headquarters; that they were of unusual size-cov- ering some ten acres each, and for the convenience of the   "AND OF WASHNGTON.      171 inmates had noiseless railroads running through the pas- sages and corridors on every floor, and an elevating appuratus extending to the highest rooms in the build- ings. Have halls and banqueting rooms large enough to accommodate ten thousand persons at a time-are built in fact, on a scale of magnitude somewhat in pro- portion to the size of the country, and the wealth and power of the party organizations of which they are the representatives." I noticed that railroads had greatly multiplied through- out the whole country, but especially in the west and south, where every village and hamlet seemed to be pro- vided With this means of travel and commerce. Great changes I observed, had been made in constructing these thoroughfares. Instead of meandering over the face of the country, following the course of streams and valleys, and being elevated and depressed for every slight hill or dale, they were now laid on straight lines, and nearly level or on long and easy grades. This had been accom- plished by digging down or tunneling hills and mountains, and filling up valleys, until a straight and nearly level line could be obtained for every leading railroad in the country. Trains of cars seemed to be constantly passing and repassing over the railroads leading from the Atlan- tic to the Pacific states, and the' ports of the west were filled with the shipping of every nation. The flags of the United States and Russia, appearing, however, largely to predominate. On the western slope of the continent I observed that a large proportion of the land was devoted to the culti- votion of the vine, and I could see that many of the peo- ple were engaged in the manufacture of wine. On call- ing my friend's attention to this fact, he informed me that   172 )    THE MONK OF TIlE MOUNTAINS, the grape and wine crop of the Pacific states were now the most important, and of greater value than all the gold, silver and other mineral wealth of the west; that this part of the country had been found so far, to be the best adapted to the vine of any country in the world, and its culture was of course attracting more attention than any other branch of industry.

IN sweeping my glass over the panorama of the country I saw many things in the way of improvement in machin- ery, and new inventions, that attracted my attention, and among the rest was a sight of surpassing beauty and util- ity. In every city and town, along every railroad, turn- pike and other thoroughfare throughout the whole coun- try, as well as along the banks of every navigable river and lake, and on many farms and plantations, were placed artificial lights of intense brilliancy, and at intervals so short as almost to illuminate the whole continent. "You see," said my monitor, who seemed at all times to know what was within the field of my telescope, "the result of an important discovery made a long time ago, but not brought into general use till lately, on account of the scarcity of material necessary to its utilization. This scarcity, together with the expense of preparing it for use, has heretofore confined its advantages to national pur- poses; but more recent discoveries have disclosed the   174      TlHE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. tact that the supply is unlimited in quantity, and as the preparation lias been greatly simplified and cheapened, it lias now superseded all other artificial lights. By its gen- eral introduction and use traveling, by land or water, has been rendered more safe; murder, arson, theft, and other crimles, have been diminished; and all labor, whether il the field or work shop, can be performed by night as well as by day. By a simple arrangement connected with the wires of a telegraph, these illuminators throughout the wlhole length of a railroad, streets of a city, or through a hotel or private mansion, can be lighted up by the sin- lc toluch of a key; so that if it were desirable, an oper- ator in hs office in an Atlantic city could, by a single llaniDllation, send forth a stream of light that should ex- tend( to the Pacific coast. "Now follow down the course of time but for a few years, and you will be pained by visions of a different nature than those you have been contemplating. Gaunt falIine now pervades many portions of the land, and fills the whole country with'co strnation and woe. "The great prosperity of the people for many years had increased the population in an unusual ratio, and as min- ing, manufacturing and speculation had afforded more than ordinary inducements to industry, agriculture to a -reat extent had been neglected, reducing very much the excess of food usually carried over from one harvest to the next. Following this a succession of most disastrous earthquakes, such as the country had never known, with the never-failing accompanying floods, had laid a large portion of the south and west in ruins, producing pesti lence and death, and as you will now see followed by a wide-spread and most disastrous famine. To alleviate the distress, everything has been done within the power of   I ' EARTHQUAKES AND FAMNE.      175 man. Foreign lands, the rivers and ocean have all been laid under contribution, but still the cry is for food. Na- tional aid has been invoked and extended to many locali- ties on a scale most magnificent and gigantic; but the feeding of millions of people, entirely deprived of their usual supplies, is found to be no trifling matter, even to a nation so numerous, rich and powerful as the United States. Besides, as this misfortune and necessity were so sudden and unexpected, it has been found impossible to prevent great suffering, and in many cases starvation and death." I now raised the glass to my eye, and the sight that met me was truly harrowing and awful. Numerous individu- als-men, women and children-were presented before me in the last stages of hunger and famine-ghastly skel- etons, with hardly flesh enough on their bones to give them human form. Some less exhausted were feeding on the grass and weeds of the field, some on the most loath- some vermin and reptiles, and in a few instances eating the corpses of the dead. From this dreadful and sickening sight I turned away in horror, hardly realizing it possible that the country which had so lately possessed such great abundance, could so soon be reduced to such terrible extremities. "You see," said my friend, "that a people can never entirely escape the punishment due to national sins. The love of money has been denounced by high authority as the root of all evil, and when it has taken such entire possession of individuals or nations as to absorb their whole attention, causing them to forget all other interests and duties, they are sure to reap the bitter fruits of their avarice, oftentimes in most dire calamaties. "Had the people of the country continued in their legit-   176     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. imnate business and not made haste to be rich, this calam- ity of extreme famine would probably never have come- upon them. For although they could not have foreseen or prevented the earthquakes and floods, their usual in- dustry would have supplied them with stores of food, which would have carried, them over their temporary defi- ciency, and placed them beyond the reach of famine or hunger. However, the evil is passing away, and to guard. aluainst similar occurrences the government is providing large stores of grain and other durable food, which they require to be changed often enough to preserve it from injury or decay." In again looking through the glass the appearance of abundance and plenty every where met my vision. The earth was again clothed in its richest attire of crops and fruits, and every where seemed providing for the wants of man. Again the smiles of contentment lighted up and adorned the features of the people, who seemed already to have forgotten their late calamity, and returned to their previous pursuits and occupations. My friend now in a moralizing manner, resumed his remarks, observing that the recent chastening inflicted on the nation, joined perhaps to other causes and influ- ences, had to some extent corrected and improved the morals of the people, " crime and licentiousness," said he, ' are not so common now as they were twenty years ago. Religion, or what was then taught as such, has been purged of some of its absurdities; and ministers of the Gospel are not now so directly the encouragers -of crime as they then were. Legislators, courts and juries, backed and supported by public opinion, have divested them- selves of some of the "mawish sentimentality, that for- mnerly governed and influenced their proceedings, and are   EARTHQUAKES AND FAMNE.     1" now more willing that crime should be followed by pro- per and suitable punishment. On the whole the nation is again establishing a reputation for law-abiding morality, where life and property are protected as in other civilized countries." "And now,'said Jie, "let us close the observations of the day, as the remaining years of the period we have been considering, furnish no remarkable incidents in your country, and the future of the other nations of the earth we are not at present considering." So saying he took my arm and soon we'found ourselves at my hospitable lodgings. (                      1, . - 1 "   178      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. CHAPTER     XXIII.

' It is not all of life to live, Nor all of death to die." -Anonl . MY friend made an early call this morning, and informed me that this was an important holiday in Paradise, and that"it would be interesting to me to attend some of the places of its observance. As I had already taken my morning meal, we made but little delay, and moved through the air until we reached a considerable elevation, overlooking a vast plain, where we found eligible situa- tions from which we could witness the amusements and ceremonies of the day. My friend explained to me that this was rather a secn- lar holiday-more for the amusement and exercise of the people, than for any religious ceremonies or observances. With this qualification, however, that in every act of their existence, their dependence on the power and goodness of God was ever present to their minds.   HOLIDAY IN PARADISE.      179 We could see that a vast concourse of people, of both sexes, including many children, had already assembled. Of these, some were carrying flags and banners, some were engaged in athletic or active exercises, while others were playing and romping with each other, much as a crowd of happy people would do in the world of flesh and blood. Indeed the whole scene was so similar to some I had witnessed in my youth, with perhaps a little more gorgeousness in dress and gayety in behavior, that I could hardly realize that I was not gazing upon an assemblage of happy people in the land of my childhood. While looking through the vast multitude I ,asked my friend if he could point out to me any of the celebrated heroes, or prominent individuals of antiquity? Where was Philip of Macedonia, or Alexander his son? where was Xerxes or Xenophon, or Homer, or Socrates? Where were the warriors and statesmen of Rome? The Catos, the Ctesers, and Pompeys, about which we had read so much, and whose feats of arms or statesmanship had so often convulsed the world In short where was Adam and Eve, and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Moses and Aaron; David and'Solomon, from whom we heretofore derived our knowledge of creation, and through whom we deduce the origin of our religion? To these questions my friend replied, ' You see but a small portion of Paradise, not even a hamlet compared  to a continent, and it would be but accidental if any of the celebrities you mention were present, even if they had ail arrived and continued in this happy land. But you must know, that all noted men are not good men; that most of the warriors and many of the statesmen of the world, lead such lives as to require long terms of proba- tion before they are ermitted to inhabit these realms of   180     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. purity. Besides some of those you have named have no doubt, passed on to more elevated spheres, where they are now enjoying a higher and happier organization. A few, however, of those you mention are here, and but a few moments since I saw in the crowd, engaged at a game of quoits, both Solomon and Homer. There they are now!" pointing to two men thus engaged. "The tall m;la! is Solomon and the shorter one Homer. These men alllse themselves with as simple and innocent employ- lnents as the most insignificant amongst us. It has been decreed, and so proclaimed by our Saviour, that unless ye lbe)rccie like little children, ye can in nowise enter the Kingdom of God." Some little time before mid-day a procession was forllled by the whole assembly, preceded and accom- p1anied by the most enchanting music, both vocal and instrumental. Every individual in the procession both male and female seemed to take part in the concert, and the volume of melody issuing from the vast throng, was sulld as (an never be heard in the sublunary world. The procession continued its march round the hill on which we were stationed, and proceeded to a beautiful grove in which were tables covered with the choicest viands, and supplied with beverages that seemed to exhil- erate, but not intoxicate those who partook of them. Here all seemed to enjoy the entertainment spread before them, in the highest degree, and for some time directed most of their attention to their physical wants. As in all other places devoted to worship or amusement, that I had seEll in Paradise, there were here large numbers of foun- tains of the purest water, where drinking cups of silver were suspended for the accommodation of the thirsty After some little time-speaking seemed to become the   HOLIDAY IN PARADISE.      181 order of the day, and from a high platform gorgeously, but tastefully decorated, a speech was delivered that appeared to inspire the crowd with intense excitement and pleasure. Our distance from the speaker was so great that I could not distinguish what he said, but from the cheers and shouts of the audience I inferred that his subject was an interesting one, and that he was probably an orator. This part of the day's ceremonies were so similar to what I had seen in the lower world, that'had I not known otherwise, I should have supposed myself in some intelligent and wealthy community there. Here, however, there was no appearance of jealousy or envy, which is sometimes exhibited in the lower world on such occasions. All seemed to enter into the enjoyment of the day, taking part in the ceremonies, and while enjoying happiness themselves, striving to make all others happy. After the speaking there was more music, and while it was performing the procession was again formed and the marching resumed; flags and banners were displayed as before, and the march continued round the hill to the place-of starting, and here after a short address from one who appeared to be the officer of the day, the ranks were broken up and the crowd dispersed. All in the most happy humor, now departed for their homes, leaving the plain and grove solitary and quiet. The sun tempered with a soft and pleasant atmosphere, was now approaching the verge of the western horizon, while the full moon that never wanes in this happyland, was rising in her glorious majesty in the east, producing in me a feeling of devotion and thankfulness, that I felt no disposition to hide or surpress. My friend nioticing my state of feelings, observed that   182     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. this was indeed a manifestation of Divine goodness, be- stowing upon his creatures such happiness as can only be enjoyed by those who are in a state of innocence and truth. "Why," said lie, "will man be perverse and wicked, when punishment is so sure to follow, while virtue and morality are equally sure of their reward." le now took my arm and we proceeded to my lodgings where we found the table spread with extra care, and with plates for two instead of one as usual. "Now," said my friend, "I will explain to you why we did not partake of the refreshments at the tables to day. I had determined to dine with you, and to join you in a bottle of our holi- day nectar. I therefore wished to preserve our appetites unimpaired, so that we might the more fully enjoy our private entertainment." The food having been brought in we took seats at the table, and truly a feast was spread before us worthy the occasion. My friend now filled a goblet for me, and another for himself, from a decanter that had been set before us, and raising his glass said, "here is to an early and eternal re- union." He then drank with a heartiness and relish equal to anything I had seen among mortals. I followed his example, and found the nectar all he had represented it to be, and much superior to that furnished me as an every day beverage. "This is of the same quality," said he, that was used at the public tables throughout Paradise to-day, and is only furnished on holidays and other impor- tant occasions; not as you may suppose, on account of its increased cost or scarcity, but because it is proper, and adds to our enjoyment, that we should have something extra on extra occasions; we know nothing of cost or scarcity of anything we need in Paradise." Our repast was so excellent and our appetites so good,   HOLIDAY IN PARADISE.      183 that we prolonged our sitting to a comparative late hour, during which time my friend enlightened me on-various subjects of which I had before been in the dark. He in- formed me that his own death had taken place about three years before that time; that to the period of his death he had preached to various churches and denomin- ations of the Christian religion; "for," continued he, "by the time I became acquainted fully with any system of faith, I discovered so many absurdities and contradictions in it, so little love and charity, and so much hypocrisy among the members of the churches, that I became disgusted with my situation, and tried the experiment of some other. "However," said he, in conclusion, "I found a great deal of good and some bad in all the churches, and learned that man on earth is very far from perfect; that we must take him as he is, and not as we might wish him to be. That God has his own objects and purposes to accom- plish, and that in due time we shall be made acquainted with them, so far as it behooves us to know. My friend, when about to take his leave observed, "remember there is no restriction placed on your indul- gences-you still have another bottle of nectar on your table, drinlto your fullest satisfaction without fear of consequences.'          , At my request he joined me in one more goblet, when on his bidding me good night I retired to my bed in a state of enjoyment and happiness that I had never ex- perienced since the unfortunate day on which I sailed from Philadelphia to England, leaving my wife and part- ner at home together. And here, I must say, that I cannot regard myself as entirely blameless in thus exposing a young, lovely and ardent wife lo temptation. I ought to have taken her   184      THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. with me, or restored her, during my absence to her father's family. I cannot believe that she was deliber- ately corrupt, but must have fallen in an unguarded moment; and as the sweetest wine makes the sourest vin- egar, when a virtuous woman once falls, she becomes the most desperate and degraded. To all husbands having young and lovely wives I would say, remember that they are but human, with like frail- ties and passions as yourselves. How would you resist importunities and opportunities such as they may be sub- jected to? Remember the prayer of our Saviour, 'lead us not into temptation."

THE call of my friend next morning was rather later than usual, as explanative of which he observed that he was aware that I would be disposed to sleep longer than on previous mornings, and that we would still have time enough during the day to consider the subjects that we should have under review   on the shores of the great ocean. On arriving at our former place of observation- raising the glass to my eye I saw what I took to be a numerous squadron of gigantic horses with riders, coursing with unusual speed over the western plains. On a second look I discovered that they were in pursuit of a large body of Indians and others, who appeared to be also mounted and flying before them. The pursuers, however   1 bG   THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. had greatly the advantage in speed, and soon coming up with their flying foe, began an indiscriminate and most destructive slaughter of the panic-stricken fugitives. The slaughter, I observed, was all on one side, for although a perfect recklessness was manifested on the part of the pursuers, none of them seemed to suffer in the melee. Turning to my friend I asked for information of what I saw, "The pursuing horseman," said he, " are clothed in mnail, and are riding on iron-clad steam horses. Of course as they are impregnable, they can suffer no damage from the missiles of their enemies. What you have witnessed is the pursuit by a comparatively small number of men, of ail immense horde of savages and renegade white men, who have infested the western country for years, robbing and mlurdering all defenceless travelers that came in their way. Hiding in the defiles and inaccessible valleys of the Rocky Mountains, they would sally out mounted on fleet native horses, and after committing their depre- dations, retreat into their fastnesses, where no ordinary armed force could overtake them. "These savages are the remnants of the numerous Indian tribes that were subdued and mostly exterminated many years ago, joined by the escaped criminals and fugi- tives from justice who have fled from the older portions of the country, leading the lives of bandits and robbers. The evil, however, at last became so great that govern- ment was induced to offer a large reward for the capture or extermination of this horde of outlaws; and what you have just seen was the result of that policy. ' These steam horses are one of the greatest inventions of the age; not only in war but in peace have they worked changes and produced results hardly contemplated by their inventor. One hundred miles an hour, over the   GREAT INVENTIONS.       187 roughest and most unequal surfaces, is no uncommon speed for them to accomplish; and this with a safety of movement, and an ease of control and managelment never before attained by any locomotive machines. One steam horse, which in pe'aceful pursuits needs no coat of armor, will perform the labor of fifty horses of flesh and blood. For plowing, reaping, mowing, hauling loads, or in fact any other labor of the farm or the road, his services are invaluable. In mining, too, he has been used to the greatest advantage. Instead of penetrating the earth but a few hundred feet, as heretofore, miners are now enabled, by the aid of this powerful auxiliary, to descend thou- sands of feet below its surface, and bring forth the riches deposited at those profound depths. The consequence is that gold, silver, and other precious metals, are now found in such quantities and purity as were never dreamed of by the fathers of the present generation. The utility of machinery has been greatly promoted by the discovery of new kinds of fuel, and the improve- ments in concentrating its power; also in the use of other elements than water for producing steam. Now every household has its steam engine, which performs most of the work of -the family-so that while the farmer is plow- ing or reaping, mowing or threshing, hauling in his crops, sawing his lumber, or doing other farm work,-all with steam ;--his wife and daughters; with the same agency, may be seen churning their butter, washing and ironing their linen, sewing their garments, or knitting their stock- ings. In short, doing nearly all the duties of their house, with as much ease and accuracy as they could formerly do with their more careful and laborious manipulations. "These discoveries and improvements have been intro- duced into old machinery as well as new. By them steam   188     TIIE MONK OF TIlE MOUNTAINS. shipping has economized in room and increased in speed. Railroad locomotives, air ships and stationary machinery, have added to their power and utility, and cheapened their expense. Nor has science and the ingenuity of mtan yet found their limits. Every day brings to liglit new improvements, and adds new impetus to the march of intellect. Thus is man gradually accomplishing his destiny in the world of flesh, and subordinating matter to his uses and purposes. It is now conceded that machinery, and the power to propel it, are his true and legitimate slaves; and that his physical wants will hereafter be supplied principally through their agency; he being required only to superintend and direct their operations. "Yet with all his powers of invention and improve- ment; his seeming control over the elements; and not- withstanding his pride and arrogance, which often pre- sumptuously assume to criticise the prerogatives and power of God himself! man is only finite, and indued with limited capacities. Many things on which his very exist- ence hourly and momentarily depends, are beyond his comprehension or understanding. He can neither ana- lyze or define electricity or polar attraction, fire or grav- itation. The reproduction of animal or vegetable life, the likeness transmitted from generation to generation, the laws of sensibility, and the operations of even his own nervous system, are all sealed books to the under- standing of the wisest savant! He knows these things exist, but what they are or how they operate, are beyond his ipowers of comprehension. He. calls them nature; little reflecting that what he calls nature, are but the laws that God has impressed upon His works, or emana- tions from His Divine Essence!   RIVER OF LETHE.       189 My friend now proposed that we should diversify our day's employment by visiting other objects of interest in. Paradise than those which we had seen, "for after all," said he, "you must take a greater interest in the affairs of eternity, in which you will have an endless existence, than in those of time where your stay will be so evanes- cent and temporary." He now took my arm, when we immediately rose into the air to a considerable hight, but without the darkness and insensibility that had always attended, me on our passage to and from the great ocean. After sailing for some time we came in sight of a deep valley, overshadowed by high and gloomy forest trees, which were covered with lichens and moss, so dense as to almost shut out the light of day, and so nearly resembling the dark grove to which I was taken after attempting to speak to my father-in-law, as to lead me to t o n that we were approaching the same locality; /ut on ask- ing my conductor if this was the case, lheassured me that it was not, but that we were now aboult entering a sacred wood or grove, devoted to entirely (ifferent pur- poses. "Through this wood and along this alley," said he, "runs the river of Lethe, or Waters of OblirMk Who- soever bathes in or drinks of those waters forever orgets all things that he wishes not to. remember, and so Iaas these particular facts and circumstances are concerned, may be said to commence his existence anew. This ;fr- getfulness applies to events and transactions in the lower world, as well as those which may have taken place in this; for even here man is not so perfect as not to com- mit slight'errors, or at least to be the actor in, or object of transactions which he may wish to forget, or that had never happened. Let us now approach the shore of   190(     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. the stream and examine for ourselves what is actually passing there." As we penetrated the overhanging arches of the wood, the shadows seemed to deepen and the objects to become more obscure, until we were surrounded by almost the darkness of night, and it was with some difficulty that we could grope our way and make progress over the fallen limbs and other obstacles that were scattered along our Iath. My friend here gave me his hand, observing that we had but a short distance further to go, and that we would soon have smoother walking and more light. After proceeding for some time over these difficulties, we arrived upon the bank of the stream, which was situated in a deep gully or bed, and appeared to be so sluggish and dead as hardly to present any evidence of current in either direction. Here we found a small temple, com- posed of black marble, covered completely over with a kind of ivy, so as to hide all parts of it except near the entrances and on the inside. In the centre of this tem- ple, on a raised pedestal, stood a statue of a female, com- posed of the same kind of marble, over the head of which was written in circular letters, "The Temple of Oblivion -drink of the waters of Lethe and forget." My friend now motioned me to a seat, and by placing his finger upon his lip intimated that we were to keep silence. Directly after, there entered the temple from a direction opposite from that which we had come, two men of striking resemblance, who after bowing before the statue, and holding each other by the hand, descended by a flight of steps to the river, and raising some of its water in cups which they had taken from the door of the tem- ple as they passed out, they each repeated the words, Let us forget that we have been enemies," and drank of   RIVER OP LETHE.       191 the water. Instantly a great change took place in their nanners and appearance. Instead of the grave, formal and rather reserved manner with which they had con- ducted themselves to each other, even in the act of shak- ing hands and putting the water to their lips, they now exhibited the warmth and confidence of affection, embrac- ing, hugging and even kissing each other, with all the ardor of lovers, and with an earnestness thati left no doubt of their sincerity. As they took their departure, arm in arm with each other, my friend broke silence, observing that these men were brothers; that their enmity had existed from child- hood, and that on arriving at Paradise, they could not overcome their natural dislike so as to tolerate or enjoy each other's society. "But now all this is forgotten and and they only know that they are brothers and friends." While we yet retained our seats many persons of both sexes, came and after going through similar forms and ceremonies-some confessing their faults and offences, and others silently, partook of the waters and departed in the warmest friendship, and in 'te greatest degree of happiness. Among others came two of different sex, who, my friend informed me, were husband and wife in the lower world, but who had been estranged and separated for many years before their deaths, and since their first arrival in Paradise, had passed a term of probation in purgatory, preparatory to their admission to these realms of happiness. That term having expired, and they having given evidence of thorough repentance and reformation, they are now desirous of mutual forgiveness and eternal forgetfulness of all the causes that led to their ul- happy separation. As they approached the statue of oblivion they fell   192     TIlE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. upon their knees, holding each other by the hand, and there confessed to one another the many acts of infidelity to the marriage vow of which both had been guilty. These seemed to be the acts on which the greatest stress was laid, and to which the most importance was attached; other of- fences were admitted by the husband, such as cruelty and neglect, but to those the wife appeared to pay very little attention. As they descended to the water some little doubts appeared to rest on the countenance of both, and especially on that of the wife, as to whether total forget- fulness, and oblivion could follow so great direlictions front duty as they had disclosed. However, after drink- ing of the waters a sudden change came over them, and the features of both were lighted up with confidence and love, showing that the recollection of all previous of- fences had been obliterated from their memory. Almost b)efore they had completed their draughts of the water, they sprang into each others arms, hugging and kissing each other with all the warmth and affection of a new married pair. As they took their departure we could see them stopping to embrace and kiss from time to time, until thhy were out of sight. At length came two men who, by their garb and staid demeanor, evidently were two teachers of religion, and as my friend informed me were late arrivals in Paradise from the lower world; and that when appearing at the judgment bar, they were required as a condition prece- dent to their remaining here, that they should both drink of the waters of Lethe, and forget and forgive the hostility that had existed between them, and the slanders and abuse which they had mutually heaped on each other's faith and reputation-while preaching the doctrine of love and charity in the world of flesh. While these men   RIVER OF LETHE.       193 were clasping each others hand, and bowing to the sta- tue of Oblivion, preparatory to drinking of the waters of forgetfulness, it was evident that up to that moment no forgiveness of each other had yet taken place; for although in form nothing was wanting on the side of either to evince perfect reconciliation, it was obvious that such reconciliation was entirely constrained and not a voluntary offering of the heart. After performing the usual obeisance they descended arm and arm to the stream, all the while repeating the proscribed formula of the hoped for forgetfulness, until they raised the water to their lips, and apparently took in a long'draft of the precious fluid. But here the mutual want of fairness became manifest, for on each turning his back to the other, as if to recover his breath, both spirted from their mouths what they had taken into them, and each turning quickly toward the other, accused him of a want of hon- esty and good faith. From a simple charge of unfairness, they soon came to applying opprobious epithets until it almost seemed that they would resort to personal violence and blows; when in a storm of passion they separated, taking different directions and passing rapidly out of sight. My friend, who for some time had been almost con- vulsed with suppressed laughter, now broke out into a perfect cachination of mirth, and as soon as he could articulate, proposed that we should bring our days labor to a close and return to my lodgings. "For we shall have no better time," said he, "to break off our labors than after such a ludicrous performance." Taking my arm we arose into the air, and as we sailed leisurely along, my friend often indulged in merriment at what he characterized as the laughable exhibition of the 12   194     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. two preachers; and even after our arrival at the cottage, lie continued to comment on their inconsistent conduct. "It is most singular," said he, "that the pretended fol- lowers of the meek and lowly Jesus-whose teachings, while on earth, were those of love, charity and good will to all men-should be the most bitter and unrelenting in their enmities and hostilities to each other; that the mere difference in matters of faith and abstract opinion, in which none, while in life, can be certain of infalibility, should in their uncharitable judgment, subject all that disagree with them, to the severest of eternal punish- ments! What estimate such men set upon the wisdom and goodness, the love and mercy, of our Heavenly. Father, surpasses my comprehension. The effect of their education was exhibited to us to-day, when even the hopes of the joys of Paradise could not induce them to forgive and forget their mutual wrongs and injuries." After a social glass my friend took his leave, promising to see me again in the morning. My supper was now brought in and after a hearty meal and a short walk in the garden, I retired to bed.

AT the usual time in the morning my friendly guide made his appearance and announced his readiness to accompany me again to our place of observation on the shores of the great ocean; observing that our investiga- tions were drawing to a close, and that he should not de- tain me much longer id Paradise. On arriving at our for- mer situation and handing me the telescope he repeated his usual caution as to the period of future history that I was this day to contemplate; seeming to apprehend that I would confound dates so as not to understand the pro- gress of time and the occurrence of events in their pro- per order. "You are now," said he "at the date of 1940 and your investigations will extend over the last ten years."   196     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS On raising the glass to my eye and slowly bringing it to bear on the various parts of my extended country, the firt object that struck my attention was the great in- crease in the numbers of railroads throughout the whole land, but especially those leading from east to west. Of roads extending from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific ocean, I saw more than twenty distinct rail roads. Of these extending through the whole Republic, from north to south, the number was not so great, but so far as I could judge there were but few portions of the country which were not accommodated with these thoroughfares. In watching the progress of the trains it struck me -that they were running at an unusual speed, which lppearance I mentioned to my attendant and enquired if such was the fact. His answer was that rail- road trains had been increasing their speed for- many years, and since the thorough lighting of the roads and the improvement in their construction, they could do sc with perfect impunity. In fact, that railroa - veling now, when speed is at the rate of fifty miles an hote safer than when the speed was only thirty miles an hour The time required now, to travel across the contineni from ocean to ocean, over the common railroads is oniy three days, and it has been done in less. Other improve ments, however, have been introduced besides a mere in crease of speed. By the use of concentrated fuel, grea saving has been made in the time that was formerl: consumed in taking in wood or coal, and besides no stop page is required for the feeding of hands or passengers Full provision is made on all railroads for eating an sleeping of every person on board the train. While o the subject of railroads I must call your attention to new kind of road, that for most purposes is supersedin   GREAT PROGRESS.       197 those heretofore in use. This is the pneumatic or tubular road, where the trains run within an air-tight tube, and, where motion is obtained by the exhaustion of the atmos- pheric air in front of the train, and the injection of a pow- erful blast in its rear. Both these operations are per- formed by machinery and can be increased to any desired extent. "By this improvement a speed of two miles a minute, or one hundred and twenty miles an hour has been attained with the same safety of one third of the speed on ordinary roads. Of course, provision had to be made to prevent the friction which would result from such great speed, by the use of new metals and improved lubrica- tors. Objections are raised by some travelers against the confinement in an air-tight tube, even to accomplish so great a degree of speed, but the saving of time is so im- portant that persons on business pretty generally adopt this mode of travel. The distance from ocean to ocean can be made on these roads in twenty-four hours, and their number is rapidly increasing." But enquired I, if those tubes are air-tight how are they lighted and ventilated, or do passengers ride in the dark, or suspend breathing while on the route . "These diffi- culties," he replied, "which look very formidable at first sight, have been fully overcome by scientific intelligence and perseverance. For light, air-tight glass windows have been introduced; alnd for ventilation enough of the fresh air that is forced into the tube to produce motion, in the rear of the train, is admitted into the cars, while the foul air is disposed of by the exhaustion in front of the train -all perfectly easy when once understood. You will re- collect that there is no smoke or dust to be encountered on those roads, and on this account alone many give them   19S     T-HE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. the preference, even when the saving of time with them is no object. These tubular roads are constructed under, as well as over rivers and other waters; through moun- tains and over valleys-in fact, they are made to run nearly straight and level throughout their whole length. By their agency government can transport, on urgent occa- sions, an army from one side of the continent to the other, in thirty hours. While these improvements in railroads have been pro- gressing, other great enterprises have not stood still. The advance in the mode of transmitting thought from one part of the globe to the other by telegraph, either on land or under water, has been nearly as great. Already the depths of the oceans in every direction have become a network of magnetic cables, bearing intelligence from all portions of the habitable earth. While on land, carried in metallic pipes, below the surface, are wires extending to every city, town, village and hamlet, throughout the broad land. "These improvements have necessitated others con- nected with the central government of the nation, which add to its efficiency, and its usefulness and protection to the people. A new department of government has been created, known as the department of intelligence, the duties of which are to receive reports from all parts of the world, and again to diffuse such intelligence throughout the whole interior of the country. By these means, whatever of importance happens on the globe, may within the next few hours, be known to every citizen of the United States.

"These government telegraphs, however, have not superseded or done away with those owned and managed by private individuals or companies; they continue as formerly, and move within their own sphere, and in their own way. While speaking of submarine telegraph wires, it may not be out of place to mention other enterprises and im- provements, connected with the explorations of the ocean depths, which have produced important results in the fields of science. Machinery has been introduced which enables man to descend to, and traverse the floors of the ocean in its profoundest depths. By this means he is not only enabled to reclaim vast amounts of derelict property that has been lost, or cast overboard from the fleets of a thousand years, but he is also able to solve many ques- tions of science and phylosophy, heretofore shrouded in mystery, or only understood through inference and specu- lation. This discovery or invention has given rise to great numbers of companies, or associations of Americans, who are visiting all parts of the world, and especially the Gre- cian Archipelago, China and other early settled portions of the globe, obtaining permission from the different gov- ernments, to explore the bays and harbors of their coasts in search of lost treasure, and in many instances going where consent is not needed, into the depths of the un- claimed ocean. The amount of wealth thus reclaimed has been great, beyond all estimation, and the ocean proved to be a fruit- ful field of enterprise for many generations to come. Among other property, wine has been discovered and   200      TIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. brought up, supposed to be one thousand years old. In the lower depths of the ocean corruption and decay hardly take place, and human bodies have been found, bearing the appearance of recent burial, on which were ornaments of great antiquity." "There are many events which I wish to explain to you from this stand-point," continued he, "but to-day we shall not have time to consider them, we will, therefore,. now return to the cottage and complete our survey of the decade on an other occasion." So saying he took my arm, and as usual we soon reached my lodgings. t      /m\   GREAT INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES.     201 CHAPTER XXVI.

MY friend stayed with me but a short time last evening, but called rather earlier than usual this .morning, and proposed to return to-day to the place of our yesterday's observations, and complete our investigations which we left unfinished of the future events, which he desired to exhibit to me. On reaching the shores of the ocean and taking my usual position, he repeated his accustomed caution as to the date of my stand-point. "You still occupy," said he, "the date of 1940, and are now to look through the latter years of the preceding decade." After adjusting the glass to the proper date, he put it into my hand with the direction that I should take a view of that portion of the United States that formerly consti- tuted the empire of Mexico. As I passed the instrument over that portion of the continent, the first object that   202     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. arrested my attention was an immense field of melted lava, that seemed to be flowing from the foot of a volcano or burning mountain. For many miles through a wide valley was to be seen this stream of liquid fire, running towards the dry bed of an ancient river, and through that to an arm or bay of the Pacific Ocean. The spectacle appeared to be watched by great multitudes of people, whlo were going'and coming-passing to and fro--but who seemed to be mere spectators of the phenomenon. Among others, however, I noticed some half-a-dozen horse- "en who were riding back and forth, approaching the burning mass as near as it seemed safe to do so, and who appeared by their motions to be superintending the operation. On appealing to my friend for information of what I saw, lie replied that here was another evidence of the skill and enterprise of my countrymen. Those men whom you saw on horseback," said he, " are members of a company who have contracted to extinguish the fires of this volcano. This company has been organized and in- corporated for that kind of business, and is doing a great amount of it throughout many countries of the earth. Their first proceeding is to ' tap the mountain,' as they express it, and discharge the melted lava from its internal chambers. This is done by running an excavation from tlhe base of the mountain, at as low a depression as they can find, which will afford a sufficient fall or descent from the interior of the crater, to insure the running out of most of the melted lava; and when. this is accomplished, they inject, by immensely powerful machinery, whole rivers of water, and thus quench out the remaining fires. In driving this adit or horizontal excavation, great care is needed to avoid encountering fugitive streams of lava   GREAT INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES.   203 before reaching the main body. These streams often pen- etrate to near the surface, and sometimes, as is well known, produce extensive eruptions. The object of the miner is to approach as near as the heatWill permit to the main body of melted matter; and as its support is thus weakened it soon eats its way out, but usually gives the laborers time to make their escape in safety before any considerable discharge commences. To insure their safe retreat, as well as for other purposes, railroads are laid along these adits, where trains are kept in constant readiness, with steam up, to meet any sudden emergency. "It is in the progress of these excavations that the companies-(for there are a number of them)-generally make their greatest profits; for here are often found the richest mines of gold, silver and other metals, with dia- monds and emeralds, and the whole family of precious stones. "These enterprises, with those which explore the bot-  tomn of the ocean,-bringing forth the rich pearls from its depths-are furnishing pride and vanity with an ornamen- tation heretofore unknown among the sons and daughters of Adam. "Already has Mount AEtna been relieved of her fiery burthen, and negotiations are now pending for quenching out the fires of Vesuvius and Stromboli. "These enterprises and, undertakings, which have been successfully prosecuted by the citizens of the United States, have given them a high character among other nations of the world, for skill and daring, and made the name of American synonymous with that of the giants of fable and romance.') As my friend thought we had labored enoughl for to- day, we concluded to defer our further investigations to   204     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. another opportunity, and took our course for the hospita- ble cottage. This evening my friend proposed to take his supper with me, and ordered plates for two. While at table he alluded to the subjects that we had been considering through the day, and observed that the progress of human invention seemed to be without limit. "The intellect of man when left to its natural freedom," said he, "unrestrained by the tyranny of laws or super- stition, is continually soaring upward and onward, and is forever vindicating and praising its Divine Creator, who, indued it with those powers-latent though they may be -which are forever leading towards perfection. What we have seen to-day, if described to them, might appear as fable and romance to the uninitiated and uninspired masses of mankind, but no more so than the thousand improvements and inventions would have done that have been introduced since you and I were boys. "The majority of every generation appear to think that the physical condition of man is as near perfection as it can be; and often resist any advance in arts or sci- ence that may necessitate increased labor on their part to keep up with the improvements. This probably will ever be the case, and still improvements go on, notwithstand- ing such opposition." During the evening my friend referred to my early re- turn to the earth, and observed that the time which he was permitted to detain me in Paradise had nearly expired, but that our separation would be but short; 'and," said he, "at your next visit I shall have the pleas- ure of welcoming you as one of us, and assuring you of a full communion with your relatives and friends. The lat- ter class will include all the inhabitants of Paradise."   COMPLAINING.        205 Soon after these remarks he took his leave, and I re- tired to my bed, but for some time was again unable to sleep. The thoughts of soon returning to the earth-to my lonely cave-there to pass an unknown number of years, weighed heavily on my mind and made me ex- tremely unhappy. I almost murmured against the laws of Deity which required that I should pass through the dark valley of death before I could become a permanent resident of this land of the blest! As I was already here, why could I not be divested of my earthly body, and fitted for immortality, without descending to the earth and passing through the dread ordeal of the grave? These ungrateful and impious reflections beset and weighed upon me for a long time, until, in a more happy mood, I became ashamed that I could have entertained them for a moment!- How could I, after the favors that had been conferred upon me-favors which few if any other mortals had ever before enjoyed-repine at, or com- plain of any rule or law decreed by my Heavenly Father, who had conferred these favors upon me? I felt mortified and humbled at the reflection, and strove by every effort of thankfulness and devotion, to forget my error, and again feel that I could be a subject of Divine grace and forgiveness. Agitated ty these conflicting emotions, I at length fell asleep, and did not awake till late in the morning. %.   206       THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. CHAPTER XXVII. VISITS THE BAR OF JUDGMENT-THE SOULS OF TIE DEAD-THE MiON- ARCH-THE POLITICIAN--THE CONQUEROR-THE MNISTER OF RELI- GION --THE MERCHANT PRINCE AND OTHERS PASSING TO THEIR FINAL ACCOUNT. "Rejoice, O! young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee unto judgment.- Ecclesiastes. "Of God she sung, and of the mild Attendant MERCY, that beside His awful throne forever smil'd, Ready with her white hand to guide His bolts of vengeance to their prey- That she might quench them on their way " -Moore's Loves of the Angels. MY friend this morning proposed to take me to a more important part of Paradise than any I had heretofore seen. This was no other than the Bar of Judgment, where all the souls of the dead come to be adjudged for their deeds and actions while in life in the world below, and to receive such commendation of approval or sentence of punishment as their previous conduct shall have entitled them to. Our course lay far out over the waters of the great ocean, on the shores of which we had so often raised the veil of futurity and studied the destiny of the nations. After sailing in the air for some time over this mighty expanse of water, we approached an island of large size, which seemed to be entirely covered with flowering trees and shrubs more beautiful than any I had before seen in Paradise.   BAR OF JUDGMENT.       207 As we alighted upon the shore of the island, my friend observed, "we must remove our shoes from our feet, and remain with our heads uncovered while on the island; this is holy ground, and these rules are imperative." We now entered an avenue that led in the direction of the centre of the island, and for some distance I noticed that the shrubs and trees were quite low and dwarfish, but as we proceeded we came into a forest of high trees that completely shaded our walk, and presented a scene of beauty and quiet of which it is hard to convey an idea. The avenue was carpeted with a soft, mossy grassy that rendered it as smooth and easy to the feet as down, while the odor from the surrounding and overhanging flowers, seemed to quiet almost the pulsations of the heart, and dispose the thoughts to devotion and worship. This feel- ing was greatly heightened and increased by the perfect and entire-almost painful-silence with which we were surrounded. Not a living thing-quadruped, bird or in- sect-was to be heard or seen mn any direction. Even the surf of the ocean seemed hushe to rest, so as to prevent all sound except immediately the brink of its waters. The sun shone clear an dunclouded, but through an atmosphere so mellow and yich as to give to its beams the softness of moonlight. After proceeding along the avenue for some considerable distance, we came to an opening in the forest, of circular form and of large extent -containing from eight hundred to a thousand acres, in the middle of which stood a magnificent temple. This temple appeared to be composed entirely of crystal, and that of so pure a quality that from whatever quarter it was viewed it seemed perfectly transparent. Every thing that passed within its walls could be clearly seen and understood by the spectator on the outside.   The temple itself was in the form of a cross-and could be approached and entered through large arched open- ings or doors from every point of the compass--and seemed to comlmunicate with the circumference of the island through avenues--such as we had traversed lead- ing in every direction. The space of land between the temple and forest trees was laid out in the highest degree of art, and planted with flowering shrubbery such as we had seen surrounding the outer border of the island. Jets and fountains of water were everywhere interspersed and visible among the shrubbery-all presenting a scene of quiet and silent beauty which appeared so lovely as never to tire or become monotonous to the beholder. Over the entrances to the temple, in large golden let- ters, was this sentence, "NOTHNG BUT TRUTH CAN ENTER HERE.' As we neared one of the main entrances my friend silently motioned me to follow him, giving me at the same time indications that entire silence must be observed while we were in the temple. He now led the way to a side door much smaller than the main one, and descended a spiral flight of steps which led us to a room that might be regarded as subterranean, at least it was lower than the surrounding earth and below the floor of the mlain or Judgment Hall. Here were seats arranged so as to accommodate a few spectators, but at first it was a mylstery to me how we were to see what passed in the ihall over our heads. My friend, however, now pointed to a mirror, so arranged as to give us a full view of every part of the temple, but especialiy of the main hall imme- diately above us. Through the aid of this mirror I now had time to survey the whole edifice and observe the   arrangements adopted to accomplish its obvious objects and purposes. At the centre of the great hall or rather at the inter- section or crossing of the two halls was a semi-circular BAR enclosed in front with a golden rail and supports, within which at a desk sat an august and stately looking person, before whom was spread out a large book in which he seemed to be reading. This man or angel-for I was undecided which-as I rightly inferred, was about to discharge the duties of a judge. His countenance, which was animated with intelligence, was mild and pleasant, but at the same time exhibited a firmness and determination that denoted a full consciousness of the responsibility and importance of his position. He was clothed in a mantle of pure white, and on his head was. a crown sparkling with diamonds. On each side of him, and rather in his rear, stood a young man whom I took to be a messenger, awaiting orders from his superior. This I afterward found to be true, and that as often as either of them was sent on duty, his place was supplied by another. At the further end of the hall and near one of the main openings, sat a majestic female of commandingpresence, but of sweet, benevolent and most angelic features. She too was within a small circular BAR, but without either desk, book or script before her. One messenger only attended her, and this a being, appearing more, as I had pictured to myself, the angels in Heaven-she seemed a young maiden of from twelve to thirteen years old, and of the purest and most lovely countenance that I had ever beheld. Near the judge, but outside of the bar, stood a personage with a diamond cross upon the left breast, and bearing in his hand a wand or staff denoting him to be a ministerial officer. After reading a few mo- 13     210     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. ments in the book before him, the judge, by a slight nod to this officer indicated that the court was ready for busi- ness. Thereupon the officer proceeded to the great door of the temple and proclaimed that the High Court of Paradise was now open, and that all suitors for the joys of the blest would approach the judgment bar, and make their cases known to the judge! A procession now entered the hall, and marched slowly up toward the judgment bar. The individuals composing this procession were of both sexes and of every variety in appearance. They were dressed as in life and seemed in the usual health of people of the lower world. At the head of this procession was a man rather passed the middle age, of bold and confident step and bearing, who was dressed in the robes of an earthly king, and wore a crown upon his head. As he drew near the bar, a mo- tion of the judge brought the whole procession to a stand; when in a kind and most encouraging manner he now addressed the individuals before him. "In this High Court of Paradise every suitor is permitted to state his own case, and set forth on what grounds he hopes for a decision in his favor, and on the state of facts which he himself presents will the court decide. It is well, how- ever, to know that a false statement cannot be made within this temple. Any attempt, therefore, to falsify or misrepresent the truth, will only injure the cause of him who makes it." With a nod to the man in royal robes he directed him to proceed. After a few moments hesitation, as if arranging his ideas, he addressed the court as follows: "I was born a prince, and heir to the crown of a powerful nation. Educated in the principles of virtue and religion -taught the duties of the ruler to his people-that the king was but the trustee, or embodiment of power for the   BAR OP JYDMENT.       2" benefit and happiness of his subjects, and that his miscon- duct, directly and by example would produce misery and immorality to the nation over whom he was called to rule. All these precepts, besides good example did I receive from my pious father and mother, and from the preceptors employed by them to instruct me. My childhood and youth were reasonably moral, but on arriving at manhood and obtaining kingly power, I became haughty, corrupt and tyrannical. Instead of practicing virtue, morality, and piety myself, and inculcating and encouraging their practice in others, I became licientious, immoral, and I wicked, thereby corrupting and demoralizing my whole people. I oppressed the poor and weak, laid the rich under contributions, and robbed the neighboring nations. My misconduct brought wars upon my country, causing great loss of the life of my own subjects, as well as that of my enemies. The expense of these wars also increased taxation, and aggravated oppressions. Female virtue and chastity were scoffed at and derided, and only valued in proportion as they administered to my unholy and licen- tious appetites." Here he paused and seemed to be re- flecting on what he had confessed, and whether he had any further disclosures to make. The judge now, still in a kind manner, asked him if he was through, and whether he had nothing to urge in excuse or extenuation of his conduct. "Have you," asked he, "done no good in the world, or ever repented of your sins and transgressions? His answer was that the good: he had done in the world was not very great. "It is true," said he, "that I had favorites, both male and female, whom I have enriched by my bounty, while I corrupted them by my example; but to the virtuous, moral and pious por- tion of my people, I fear I have not given much encour-   212     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINSI agement. I have never repented of my sins and trans- gressions as yet, but intended to do so when I became old, and could no longer enjoy a licentious life; and besides I had it in contemplation to appropriate a large amount of money, when I could no longer enjoy its ex- penditure, in building churches, hospitals and other ben- evolent institutions, as an atonement for my wicked life. but death took me by surprise before I was ready for him and thus defeated all my good intentions." The judge again asked him if he had nothing further to say, and on receiving a negative answer, proceeded: ' Your case, in the last particular to which you have al- luded, is not a peculiar one; many people are called upon by death before they are quite ready to entertain him,- and their good intentions, which they may have post- poned for a lifetime, are thus defeated forever-but were their lives spared to them to ever so late a period, it is often doubtful whether these good intentions would be carried into effect. Your case, however, presents other features not so common to the children of men. You were born to for- tune and power; had good education bestowed upon you; good instruction given, and example set before you, by pious and moral parents; had wealth, which would have enabled you to do much good in the world, and to have promoted the virtue and happiness of your people. But instead of all these, what do we see Let your own mouth condemn you. You have been immoral, licentious and tyrannical-corrupting by your 'acts and example others, who perhaps would have led virtuous lives had they not been subject to your baleful influence. You have thus turned the shield which was placed in your hands for the protection of your subjects, into a sword   BAR OF JUDGMENT.       213 which you have used for their destruction. You have not only your individual sins to answer fqr, but in addition, the sins you have caused others to commit. Your sen- tence, therefore, is, that you return to the earth and ani- mate the bodies of inferior animals, beginning at the dray horse, for one thousand years!" As the culprit passed out of the temple in charge of one of the messengers, who had received from the judge a paper containing the sentence, he was stopped by the female near the end of the hall, who after a few moments' conversation took the paper from the hand of the messen- ger, and altered the sentence from one thousand to five hundred years, and then gave it back to him. This act I could plainly see, and immediately surmised what my friend afterwards confirmed, that this female was the Angel of Mercy, whose office it was to thus temper and modify the sentences of justice. In the meantime, others were recounting the acts of their lives, and putting forth what they depended upon as an extenuation or excuse for their various offenses. The examination of most was very short, and resulted in re- manding the parties to the earth, to Purgatory, or in an entire acquittal. In the latter case they were conducted to their friends, that were awaiting them at the door of the temple, who bore them off in triumph and rejoicing. Among others who in turn presented themselves at the judgment bar, was a poor, contrite-looking woman, who on being requested to make her statements of the acts and transactions of her life, answered that she had been a great sinner, and had done nothing herself to merit for- giveness, but that through the atoning blood of her Sav- iour she hoped for mercy, and admission to the joys of Paradise. the judge wrote a few words on a slip of paper   214     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. and beckoned to the young maiden messenger, into whose care he confided the woman. She was now conducted to the Angel of Mercy, who soothed and caressed her, and immediately passed her to her friends, who were awaiting her arrival outside the temple. Still the throng continued to arrive, some passing almost unquestioned-the judge seeming to read their hearts and histories at a single glance-while others were subjected to a more rigid examination. Rarely, however, did the judge propound any questions, but in most in- stances simply required the candidate for Paradise to make his own statement of facts, only premising that falsehood could not be uttered in this temple of truth and justice. Many on recounting the history of their lives and con- duct, exhibited dissatisfaction and mortification at their own statements, seeming to have intended to say some- ,thing different, but had been constrained to tell the truth in spite of such intention. Occasionally the judge would remind them of some omission in their narrative, or by a single question give them an opportunity to explain what appeared uncertain or ambiguous. Throughout all these proceedings the utmost kindness and dignified familiarity were exhibited by the judge, evidently intending to put every person at his ease, and give him the full control of all his faculties. The sentences of condemnation were usually given aloud, accompanied with a written statement of the sen- tence handed to the messenger in attendance; .but in cases where there was no punishment, a slight motion of the judge to one of the messengers to pass the candidate to his friends, was all the manifestation exhibited. The confessions made by females were often of a char-   BAR OF JUDGMENT.       215 acter which would not be tolerated in earthly tribunals, and cannot with propriety be repeated here. They con- sisted mostly of an admission of extravagance, envy, slander, and mischief-making; together with an occasional confession of infidelity to the marriage vow, specifying time and place, with a particularity that was shocking to listen to. Not that other and more heinous crimes were not often confessed by them, but as a general thing their offences were less atrocious, and their subsequent repent- ance more thorough, than those of the other sex. A far greater number of them than of men plead their reliance upon religion, the atoning blood of the Saviour, and their confidence in his vicarious propitiation. In their exam- ination, the judge, by his queries and suggestions, often elicited the fact that they were more sinned against than sinning; which they seemed to get the benefit of in the sentences that followed. Though most of their sentences were light compared with those pronounced against men, 9nd consisted generallytof a few years in Purgatory, and drinking of the waters of Lethe, yet these were often ma- terially modified by the Angel of Mercy, and the term of their probation greatly abbreviated. Among those who presented themselves at the bar of judgment, was the oily politician or partizan, who on making a full confession of his many acts of bad faith, and offences against truth and justice-together with his hypocrisy in professing a religion he did not believe, merely to obtain popularity-was promptly sent below for a thousand years. The conqueror with his blood-stained hands, received the same sentence, and I observed that in neither of these cases did theAngel of Mercy inter- fere. And now comes with measured step and demure coun-   216     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. tenance the hypocritical teacher of a religion, which he did not himself believe, but which he used as a means of obtaining wealth for his own indulgences, and influence and power over his fellow men. But let him tell his own story, which he was required to do by the judge, with the information that he could not, if he would, utter an un- truth. I was early impressed," said he, "with the opinion that deception and fraud were the shortest and easiest way to obtain wealth and power in the world; and in studying the history of man, and observing his anxiety in the affairs of his future life, I was convinced that there were no subjects on which he could be so easily deceived and so thoroughly deluded, as in the matter of religion. On this theory I have acted through life, and so far as tem- poral prosperity was concerned, have been eminently suc- cessful. I have impressed upon my flock the empty forms of religious observances and the traditions of men, instead of the true essence of piety, and assured them that a barren opinion, and repentance however late, would sanctify a life most corrupt and criminal, and in- sure to the professor of such opinion eternal joys and happiness in Heaven. "These teachings I was careful to be paid for, but as obedience to them involved no sacrifice on the part of those whom 1 taught, they could well afford such payment. I have acquired wealth and influence, power and impor- tance, and been regarded as eminently moral and pious, while I was covertly indulging in the excesses and licen- tiousness of the wicked." Iaving paused in his confession, the judge asked him whether he had never contemplated an amendment of his life, and a genuine repentance of his sins?   BAR OF JUDGMENT.       217 His reply was, that he did not know what changes age, sickness or adversity might have produced upon him, but up to the time of his death he had never regarded repent- ance or reformation as of any account, as he did not be. lieve in a future existence of the souls of men. "I now find," continued he, "that I was mistaken, and if allowed an opportunity, will try to repent and reform." The judge directed him to stand aside, observing that his case would be further considered, and his sentence decided upon at another time. A messenger now took him in charge and conducted him out of the hall. During the day many other religious teachers appeared, that according to their statements had led Godly lives, and taught the true doctrine of genuine piety, who were immediately passed to their relatives and friends that were waiting to welcome them to the joys of Paradise. No questions were asked them as to the particular form of worship or doctrine of the faith which they professed and taught; but simply whetherthese were in accordance with the teachings of Christ while on earth. Late in the day there appeared at the judgment bar, an individual, who from his statements, had been eminently successful in accumulating wealth as a merchant, in the world below. From small beginnings, as he stated, he had amassed a fortune of many millions, and was still in the full tide of successful trade when death came upon him unexpectedly and put an end to his earthly career. "Had I lived a few years longer," said he, "I had hoped to be- come the richest man on earth; but death, the meddle- some old tyrant, must needs interfere, and put an end to my operations," "What disposition were you going to make of all your wealth?" asked the judge "in case your hopes had not beeni disappointed." The answer was that   21S     TIlE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. he had no definite object in view on that subject, as he had never taken time from his business to think much about it. ")o you know," asked the judge, "that great wealth may be made an agent of evil as well as of good in the world? that when not properly and judiciously used it pro- duces vice, extravagance and misery, as certainly as when properly expended, it promotes religion, morality and happiness, among the children of men " "Really," said the merchant, "these are views of the matter on which I never reflected. My happiness has consisted in accumulating millions upon millions without much anxiety about its disposition. I only considered how it could be invested to produce the largest interest, and most certain returns-not anticipating much trouble in getting rid of it when I might feel disposed to do so." "Have you bestowed much of your wealth in alns or charity to the poor and needy?" queried the judge. "No great amount was the answer; a few hundred dollars per year through an almoner-for I had no time to attend per- sonally to such matters. The extent of my business en- grossed my whole attention; I had agents in every market in the world, purchasing the richest and most expensive fabrics that could be obtained, which I again sold to my countrymen and women at inordinate profits." After a few more questions put by the judge without eliciting any important additional facts, he proceeded to pronounce the sentence. "By your own showing you have spent your whole life in accumulating wealth for which you had no use; you have abused the trust with which you were clothed, of devoting money to laudable purposes; by your example you have stimulated the avarice of your countrymen, and by the opportunity you   BAR OF JUDGMENT.       219 have afforded, you have encouraged the extravagance of your countrywomen; both of which influences have served to depress the hopes and paralyze the exertions of the poor in their efforts to obtain independence. All these consequences resulting, simply from your wish to be con- sidered the richest man in the world--a low ambition at the best. The sentence of the court is, that you be confined one thousand years in Purgatory, with a bag of gold lashed to your back for five hundred years of the time." As he went out of the temple, and passed the Angel of Mercy, she remitted one half the sentence. My friend here gave me a silent signal that it was time to leave, and on his leading the way, I followed him out of the temple, where we saw many of the happy souls who had passed successfully through their ordeal, now accom- panying their friends in triumph to their habitations. On the other side of the temple other crowds were constantly arriving, while many in sorrow were leaving from another door, for their places of probation and punishment. We now retraced our steps through the avenue to the shores of the island, when after resuming our shoes and head covering, we took our flight for the mainland -and the friendly cottage. Our passage to and arrival at the cottage was without unusual incident, but the latter was quite welcome to me as from a rather protracted fast, and exciting day's obser- vation, I felt the promptings of a sharp appetite. On my invitation my friend consented to sup with me, and ordered plates for'two. During our meal I had full oppor- tunity to enquire for information in regard to a number of things which I had seen through the day, but which the injunction of silence had prevented me from doing as they occurred. I now learned that the judge who pre-   220     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. sided at this court was in reality of the same nature of other residents of Paradise, but of greater experience and more reliable judgment than most of his compeers. That the office is often filled by others, no one being re- quired to discharge its duties constantly. That the female who presided over the office of mercy is in fact, an angel, and would correct any mistakes that might be made by the judge in the discharge of his duties. "But," said my friend, "there can be very little danger of his committing error with the enlarged and enlightened judgment that a residence in Paradise has given him." On the completion of our meal and after a short walk in the garden, my friendly entertainer took his'leave, first reminding me that to-morrow would be Sabbath, and soon after I retired to my bed.   tHRD SABBATH,         221 CHAPTER     XXVIII.

Hale. Mi slumber during the last night was disturbed and feverish, and much of the time was broken by the scenes that I had witnessed during the day. The reflection that so large a proportion of mankind would sacrifice their eternal welfare and happiness for the trifling consideration of the few years of real, or more often imaginary enjoyment,- obtained by immorality, vice and wickedness--weighed upon my thoughts, and drove sleep from my eyes. To think of how many expec- tant families had that day alone been disappointed in their hopes of welcoming a beloved relative-a father, mother, brother, sister, or possibly a darling child!-that their hopes must be deferred, perhaps, for hundreds of years, and that I had seen but a part of one day's pro- ceedings, was too painful to be borne, and I almost be- came frantic at the consideration of these mysterious dis- pensations of Deity.   222     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. After some time, however, the conviction forced itself upon me that I was, in fact, criticising the wisdom and' goodness of The Most High, and mentally finding fault witlh, and repining at His immutable ordinations. Abashed and humbled at my own presumption, I prayed for enlightenment and wisdom, and that I might again be forgiven for my manifold and repeated transgres- sions. The morning as usual brought my friendly adviser, who proposed, as this was Sunday, that we should, again attend Church, and he left it to my decision whether we should go to the neighboring place of worship, where I first attended, or visit some other at a greater distance. As the previous week had been a busy and exciting one, I elected to pass this day as quietly as I could well do, and decided to attend the Church in the immediate neighborhood; where the ceremonies and services were in all respects so similar to those heretofore described, that it is unnecessary to repeat the description. In the afternoon of the day we went among the people at their amusements, but saw or heard nothing materially different from that on previous occasions. A friend took his dinner with me, and informed me that we should have but one more day to devote to the contemplation of future events, and that with my consent we would appropriate to-morrow to that object. Being anxious to learn what was to befall the nations of the earth, and especially my own country, I readily assented to this arrangement. As nothing of importance occurred during the remain- ing part of the day or evening, and as the night passed in quiet, as usual, I shall resume my narrative on Monday morning, after our arrival at the shores of the great ocean,   THRD SABBATH.       223 where we were about considering for the last time the destiny of my own and the neighboring nations. On presenting to me the mysterious telescope, after adjusting it to its proper era, he observed that our point of observation this day would be from the date of 1950-- one hundred years from the point of time. when we first commenced our investigations into the events of the future; a foresight of which has always been a matter of solicitude, to the children of nmen, but which God in his wisdom and mercy,has withheld from their power of ob- taining.  "It is now," continued he, "fifty years since we consid- ered the condition of any country except your own, and in that time great and important changes have taken place on many parts of the face of the earth. New nations have come into existence, and old ones have nearly disappeared. The forms of government of that day have in many instances given place to new ones, and what was then regarded as fixed and permanent, with nations, families and men, have disappeared and passed away like the leaves of autumn. In fifty years, genera- tions have come and gone, and untold millions have passed to their long and final account. The glory of the successful warrior, the hopeful ambition of the politician, the mercenary and sordid joys of the miser-with the tri- umphs of beauty and the visions of love-have all been quenched in the stream of time, and covered with the oblivion of the grave! Still the family of man exists, and generation follows generation like the waves of the sea; animated with the same. hopes, emotions and am- bitions of their fathers, until overwhelmed by the stream of time they will in turn be floated out upon the bosom of the boundless ocean of Eternity!   224     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. "Now raise the glass to your eye," said he, " and glance at the neighboring nations on your own continent; and first let us look at our northern friends, who have been trying the experiment of independence and free govern- ment for the last seventy years, and see how they have improved their opportunities in that time." As I swept the glass over the extensive territory of the Canadian nation, I was greatly surprised at the important changes that had taken place in that country since we last had it under consideration. From east to west, and from the southern line, even to the bay of Hudson, and the North sea, were cities and towns, railroads and tele- graphs, manufactories and other improvements, bespeak- ing wealth, prosperity and power. A population numer- ous apparently as the stars in the firmament, engaged in all the industrious avocations of life, and seemingly pros- perous and contented. Mining and manufacturing were particularly prominent throughout the whole country, while trade and commerce enlivened the shores of the northern waters. In the south and west, agriculture seemed to flourish, where the grains and fruits of the earth, with flocks and herds were seen in abundance. You see," said my friend, "that this country presents a different appearance from that which it did when com- posed of mere provinces of a distant home government. After her independence she learned to rely upon her own resources. Elected her own officers of govern- ment-ceased to look to the mother country for favors, patronage or protection-explored her extensive territories and found them to contain latent wealth in form of mines and minerals, sufficient, when properly developed, to place her among the first nations of the earth. Coal, iron and petroleum; gold, silver, and lead, are found within   CANADA. 1        225 her boundaries in almost unlimited quantities. No longer does her native population seek employment, homes or food, in other countries; but by the inducements she offers she is attracting large numbers of emigrants from foreign lands. A portion of this-great change is no doubt to be attributed to her republican form of government, but not more than to her feeling of self-reliance, stimulated and strengthened by independence. Negotiations have often been entered into for a union with, or annexation to the United States; and frequently with a seemilg pros- pect of consummation, but when the detail of power and political representation came to be considered, the scheme has so far always been defeated. The plan is now being agitated anew in the Congress of both nations, but with what results time only can determine. "As the population of Canada is now over fifty millions, a powerful party is opposing annexation, as might naturally be expected. "Turn your glass to the west and regard the possessions of the Russian government on the North American Con- tinent." As I followed his direction, and swept my glass along toward the Pacific Ocean, the fact became obvious that the territory I was gazing on belonged to a great and powerful people. Every public building, railroad, or other work of art, seemed to be planned and built upon a scale of immense magnitude, and with a permanence of construction, which could be the work only of great numbers, stimulated by enormous wealth. Mighty cities now stood where fifty years before-at my last contemplation of the country-were the primeval forests, and where the untamed savage of the wilderness roamed abroad for his prey I The double eagle and cross "   226     CIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAItS. -emblems of national power-were seen floating on fort- ress, tower and castle, for near three thousand miles along the shores of the great Pacific Ocean. A merchant and war marine, with the same emblems, filled every port, bay and harbor on that extended coast, and their sails whitened the swellingt bosom of the deep. Throughout the country, upon the land, were the evi- dences of prosperity in mining, manufacturing and agri- tculture, equal to that of any nation on the globe. My friend here observed that since Russia had acquired a frontier on the Dardanelles, British Columbia on the Pacific, and the Fortress of Gibralter, she had rapidly be- come a great maritime people, and now ranked among the foremost naval powers of the earth. "The alliance between this country and the United States has become more and more intimate and friendly, till these two pow- ers may now be regarded as the arbiters of the world. No war can take place ol the earth if they oppose it; and no cnmbination of nati ns could be formed that would dare to provoke their hostility. "Politically the Russian Empire is fast tending to a Republic. As her people become intelligent and refined, her Czars have shown a disposition to popularize her gov- ernment. From her former Imperial Council, appointed by the Sovereign, she has progressed to a legislative congress, elected by the people, and has now divided her territory into departments, or states, whose local legislatures and governors enact the laws and manage the affairs of their respective divisions. These departments are similar to the States of the American Union, and are represented in an upper and lower house of the general congress of the nation. The Czar is still the hereditary monarch and executive of the government-can make war or peace, form   RMSSIA.         227 treaties and alliances with other nations-but can levy or collect no tax from the people in any form without the sanction of congress. All these matters are regulated by a written constitution, which was voluntarily conceded to the subjects of the empire by the then reigning Auto- crat, many years ago. For the last fifty years the policy of the government has been extremely liberal in the en- couragement of the arts and sciences, and of useful inven- tions; as well as in promoting emigration into her almost boundless territories. Education, too, both moral and physical, is a matter of compulsion; and no healthy male child is permitted to grow to maturity in moral ignorance; or without being required to know the duties of a soldier; and to possess the knowledge of some handicraft or other business, by which he can earn a support for himself and a family. "These numerous and important reformations have been brought about by the far-seeing liberality of the sover- eigns of the country, who are now reaping a rich reward in the gratitude and devotion of one of the most enlight- ened and powerful nations on the earth, now numbering over two hundred millions of souls. "Let us turn our attention," said my friend, "for a few moments to the contemplation of the republics of South America, and observe what they have accomplished in the last fifty years." As I raised the glass to my eye and swept it along the western slope of the South American continent, I ob- served great evidence of progress and improvements. Railroads had been constructed, leading from the Straits of Magellan to the Isthmus of Panama, on which I could see trains mqving with the improved speed of the north. I could also see the telegraph wires, which seemed to   228     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. ramify over the land and extend to every city, town and parish throughout the country. Other evidences of progress were not wanting in the panorama before me. Immense fortifications at every port and harbor along the coast-bristling with cannon of the largest calibre-were visible, showing that peace alone did not monopolize the thoughts of the govern- ments of those nations. If further evidence were want- ing of this fact, it was furnished in the presence of large fleets of war-ships and monitors, in the harbors and on the waters of the adjoining ocean. But while war ap- peared to be thus provided for, the arts of peace seemed not to be forgotten. Large merchant fleets whitened the ocean with their sails, while steamers were giving variety to the busy scene before me. On the mountain sides could be seen the operations of miners, bringing to the surface the rich ores and metals; and the smoke of the furnaces refining them for the uses of trade and commerce. While all these objects and enterprises appeared to be flourishing-giving employment and wealth to great mul- titudes of people-agriculture and its kindred pursuits were not neglected. Along the slopes and plateaux of the mountains were extensive plantations of grains and fruits, vineyards and gardens, that indicated both indus- trv and thrift. Here were the pretentious villas of the nabob proprietor; the extensive mansion of the farmer; and the more humble cottage of the miner and laborer; all exhibiting evidences of happiness and contentment, peculiar to the residents of the mountains. On the eastern side of the mountain range, evideno progress was also visible; but with the exception ofBra- zil the nations had not made advances equal to those on r(   SOUTH AMERICA.       229 the western side. This, my friend informe4d-me, was owing to the fact that the resources and strength of those nations had been exhausted in the frequent wars in which they had been engaged with each other, and to their contracted policy on the subjects of emigration and reli- gion. "Intolerance in religion," said he, "has produced the same effects on these republics that it has on other nations of different forms of government. "From the republics," said my friend, "let us now turn pur attention tothe empire; but in this case it is well to bear in mind that the form of government has had less influence in producing the difference in the condition of the nations than other causes not so patent to the casual observer. "This country in the first place has a territory of pro- ductive land equal, if not superior in size, to any other on the globe-a territory of not only unsurpassed richness of soil and salubrity of climate, but one, also, underlaid with the greatest amount of mineral wealth. It was only necessary, therefore, that those resources should be judi- ciously developed and properly employed, to make Brazil one of the greatest and most powerful nations on the earth. Fortunately for the people, and perhaps also for the people of other nations, her reigning emperors for the last fifty years have been far-seeing, liberal-minded men, who have adopted such measures as were calculated to promote the growth of the nation, and the happiness of their subjects. "One of their leading objects seems to have been to encourage emigration from other nations, whereby their extensive territory might be subdued by cultivation, and their unbounded stores of hidden wealth brought into use. For this purpose free grants of land have been made   230     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. to enterprising individuals and companies; all restrictions removed from the exercises of religion; and equal politi- cal and property rights conferred on natives and foreign- ers. The result of this policy is obvious in the rapid inarch of the nation to power and greatness, and in the prosperity, wealth and happiness of the people." On raising the glass to my eye, and passing my vision slowly over this vast empire, I was satisfied that my friendly informer had not overstated or exaggerated the prosperity of its population. All the evidence of greatness and wealth, industry and happiness, that could be exhib- ited by any nation, was spread out before me. Populous cities, teeming plantations; workshops and manufactories; mining and smelting of metals; railroads, telegraphs and canals, on the land; and countless shipping upon the water, were all there, and constituted some of the evi- dences of abundance, wealth and power possessed by this mighty empire. "This nation," resumed ny friend, "has studiously avoided wars for the last fifty years, and has only sought to prosper on the triumphs of peace. While other govern- ments have been exhausting their wealth, and sacrificing the lives of their people, in wars of conquest or revenge, this government has been economising both, and is now applroximating the richest and most powerful nations on the globe: her population numbers over seventy-five millions."

"As we have closed the consideration of the American continent," resumed my friend, "swing the glass across the Atlantic Ocean, and take a slight survey of a new na- tion that has sprung up and obtained an important stand- ing on the earth in less than eighty years. "About seventy-five years ago, a few capitalists of the old and new world associated themselves together, and without any charter, act of incorporation, or other bond, except voluntary articles of association, established a settlement in the interior of Africa. Here they obtained a grant of a tract of country from some of the native sov- ereigns, embracing the lakes which are the headwaters of   232     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINI. tile Nile, upon which they commenced their first opera- tions. Their original objects were to test the salubrity and healthfulness of the climate, the productiveness of the soil; and if these were found favorable, to embark extensively into the production of tropical staples, so much needed and so largely consumed, in the colder lati- tudes of the civilized world. Connected with these ob- jects they contemplated an extensive trade and traffic with the natives of the country, in ivory and such other natural productions as those unknown regions m-ight afford. ' Perhaps no peaceful enterprise was ever undertaken by man which, with apparently so inadequate means, so rapidly developed into such important results. With an organization originally composed of less than fifty men, a powerful and wealthy nation has grown into existence in less than a century, numbering many millions of inhabi- tants. Instead of a malarious, unhealthy climate, with a tem- perature so hot that human life could hardly be sustained, as llad been the former opinion, the settlers found the in- terior of the country-the table-lands of the continentt- salubrious and healthy, and with a temperature equable and pleasant; no more care being required to preserve health and insure comfort, than in other tropical latitudes of the earth. The soil was found so rich and productive, as to produce two, and in many cases three crops a year, of all the important staple productions of warm latitudes. Cotton, sugar cane, rice and maize; with coffee, tea, and the numerous fruits of the tropics, were found to flourish in the greatest perfection. "The trade with the natives, though not so important in its final results as the health and extreme fertility of   AFRICA.         233 the country, yet proved eminently profitable and entirely satisfactory to the early adventurers in the enterprise. With kindness and fair dealing, joined to a little adroit diplomacy, the friendship and good will of the sable na- tives were secured, and peace and harmony established on a lasting basis. "The new excitement of the white man's presence and enterprise, served as valuable diversions to the spirit of war, and peace has generally been preserved among the petty kingdoms and chieftanships throughout the conti- nent. In a few instances only have the whites found it necessary to administer chastisement to some of the dis- tant tribes, who had become refractory and troublesome on their hands. As soon as the white settlers were able to teach the natives that they had wants to supply--that they were poor and naked, without homes or shelter, and that industry would give them these-they proved to be valuable aids and laborers in conducting the agricultural and other operations of the country,-in fact, more valu- able than their race had formerly been when taken to other countries and reduced to slavery. "Of course all these favorable circumstances and suc- cesses of the first adventurers, could not, even if they desired it, be kept secret from the rest of the world. All the elements conspired to carry the news to every civil- ized portion of the globe, and as a consequence, emigra- tion on a scale heretofore unknown, immediately took place, and a numerous and powerful nation was thus built up as by the work of magic. Already the mineral and other rich deposits of the earth are being brought to light, and Africa is found to possess more hidden wealth of this description than any other quarter of the world. From being a simple commercial and agricultural en-   234     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. terprise, the small settlement has grown into a powerful republic, and now ranks among the great nations of the earth." On my raising the glass to my eye, and passing it over the central portion of the African continent, I could readily see the evidences of wealth and civilization, ex- tending from ocean to ocean, and embracing many degrees of latitude on both sides of the equatorial line. Large cities and towns were scattered throughout the country, especially along the shores of the two great lakes, and at the seaports of both oceans. On these lakes were numer- ous steamers plying in all directions, giving evidence of an extensive commerce and travel on their waters. Rail- roads, telegraphs, and other public improvements seemed to abound as in all other civilized countries of the world. In scanning more particularly the operations of the plantations and farms, I noticed that most of the animal power used on the  ted in elephants and giraffes. These animals seemed to Be working at the plow, the cart, and other implements of husbandry, in as docile and patient a manner as the horse or the ox in other coun- tries. A great portion of the agriculture of the country seemed to be directed to the production of cotton, which so far as I could judge, was flourishing to an unusual de- gree. In every direction immense fields of this staple could be seen, whose bursting bolls gave an appearance of new fallen snow. In these fields, as well as throughout the whole coun- try, I noticed that the white and black laborers mingled promiscuously, but by far the greater number were black. Indeed, all through the land, the manual labor in almost every branch of industry, was performed by that race.   AFRICA. Machinery, however, here as in other countries, was used in most of the operations where power was required to be exerted. My friend informed me that the natives of the country had greatly exceeded the expectations of the white pop- ulation in their docility of behavior, and the readiness with which they adopted the modes and fashions of civil- ization. "They have een found," said he, "to be a more reliable and subordinat race than any other nationality.: As the subject occu ed to me, I now enquired how the early settlers had guarded themselves against the attacks of the beasts of prey and poisonous reptiles of these trop- ical regions. "These," answered my friend, "seem much more for- midable at a distance than when we become better acquainted with their nature and habits in their own haunts and locations. At first the lions, tigers, and other ferocious beasts, were annoying and somewhat danger- ous; but as firearms and other weapons were soon adapted to the necessity, their destruction became a matter of sport and pastime, and their extermination followed of course.  "A much greater source of trouble and annoyance was found in the insect races of the country-the ants, the ticks, the centipedes, and the hundreds of other vexatious vermin-insignificant individually, and only formidable from their immense numbers. These for a time gave the settlers great trouble and uneasiness; not only from the attacks upon their own persons, but also from the annoy- ance and even destruction of their domestic animals, and the consumption of their stores of food and other property. However, after studying their nature and habits, and learning their mode of attacks, their appetites &c., the   236     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. invention and science of the people soon disposed of these nuisances. A few gallons of syrup impregnated with strychnine, or other poisonous drugs, would place millions of these insignificant enemies horps dC combat in a single night; and by a general co-operation and united effort, the whole country was soon cleared of their presence. "The gorilla and monkey races, with the serpents and other reptiles, fared no better; for when they could not be met in open warfare and subdued, they were circum- vented with traps and poison, and a few years reduced them to matters of memory or tradition. *' On the whole, this republic, though not yet so numer- ous as some other nations on the globe, is regarded as having the greatest future, and is the land of promise to the largest tide of emigration from other and more pop- ulous countries. "Thle influence and example of this people have pro- duced important changes in the condition of the other nations of Africa; and already an improvement and regen- eration hlave taken place with many of them, which prom- ises ere long to restore them to the grandeur and impor- tanice they possessed in the days of Carthage and Thebes. As we have studied the future of two of the great continents of the earth, except that of your own country, whtich I have reserved for the last, let us take a birds-eye view of Europe, and fee what has been done on this great and busy theatre of the world. Our last view was from the epoch of 1900, at which time most of the old despotisms were crumbling before the advance of education and political intelligence, while the people were demanding republican instead of mon- archical forms of government. We shall now see in this was in other instances, that revolutions do not go back-   IRELAND.         237 wards; that what was rather a vague and indefinite hope fifty years ago, has now become a consummated and tan- gible reality, and that the cause of the many has at last triumphed over the interests of the few. "Our first view," continued he, "will be of the republic of Ireland, which has now had an existence of over seventy years-fifty of which have passed since we had it under consideration. Raise your glass to your eye and see what he'r people have been doing for the last half century." As I followed his direction, the map of Ireland seemed spread out before me, on which the transactions of life were exhibited as plainly as if I were removed but a few hundred feet from the surface of the earth. It was truly surprising what changes had been wrought in the appearance of the country in this period of fifty years! The whole land appeared but one continuous and extensive garden. The cottage of the peasant had given place to the stately mansion and commodious farm house; the abodes of poverty and vice in the suburbs of the cities had disappeared, and in their places stood the extensive manufactory or edifice of education; in the val- leys and on the hillsides were schoolhouses and churches, which appeared to be numerously attended by a healthy, robust and prosperous people. Idleness, dissipation and poverty, seemed to have been banished from the island, and in their places appeared industry, temperance, mor- ality and wealth. In the seaports and harbors were numerous iron-clad war-ships and monitors, that seemed to bid defiance to the attacks of her enemies, while an extensive merchant marine appeared preparing to hold intimate intercourse with her friends. The government had seemingly fol-   2t38      THE MONK O THE MOUNTAINS. lowed the opinions of the immortal Washington, that in peace nations should prepare for war; for at every sea- port, town and harbor, were extensive fortifications and batteries of the most massive proportions, and constructed in the latest style of art and science. 'This is geographically but a small country," said my friend, "but it has already exercised a vast influence in the alfairs of the world. The green flag and harp of Erin are now seen in every harbor and on every sea and ocean on, the globe. Her sons have occupied important posi- tions Ion the bench and in the senate; in the armies and fleets of every nation on the earth; while her orators, historians ani. poets are known and admired wherever the English language is spoken. Her daughters, too, since education has been placed within their reach, have become tie most sprightly and intelligent, the most in- terestingl and best informed, as they were always the most beautiful and lovely, of any of the daughters of Europe.* "No nation has ever withstood political enthralment so l(,ri, with so little moral or intellectual abasement, as did the people of Ireland before their deliverance from the yoke of their oppressors. It was the intellect and valor of her Irish subjects, that in a great degree once gave ren own and brilliancy to the British name and arms throughout the world; and from   their withdrawal from her support, that the name of Briton is now held in so low estimation. The reader should bear in mind that these observations are made from the -tanfl-point of l5(.-inore than eighty years in the future-after independence and liberty; wealth and education shall have exercised their refining and polish- ing influences for three-quarters of a century; and if he still regard the state. mn-nts as exaggerated or extravagant, he has surely never studied the character and capacities of the Irish people.   ENGNLAND.         239 "Let us now," said my friend, "cross the narrow strip of water that separates us from England, and consider for a short space of time that once great and powerful nation, now, alas great and powerful no more, except in nem- ory and tradition." On raising the glass to my eye and sweeping it over the panorama of the island, I could not see the evidence of declension that the words of my friend would seem to imply. The population appeared dense, and industry ac- tive. The cultivation of the, soil seemed thorough and successful, and the people prosperous and happy. In what particular, I asked, has the country fallen so much from its former estate and grandeur? I see no evidence of the decline. "If you confine your remarks," replied he, "to the con- dition of the great mass of the population on the island of Great Britain, there has been no diminution of pros- perity or happiness-perhaps an increase--and it is only when we contemplate England as a power on the globe, both on land and water, and compare her present with her former power and prestige, that we realize how im- mensely she has fallen. That nation, whose proud boast once was, that 'the sun never sat on her possessions,' and that 'her flag had braved a thousand years the battle and the breeze,' has literally become a nation of artizans and shop-keepers. After the defeat and loss of her fleet at the great battle of the Thames, and the humiliating peace she was compelled to accept, she never recovered her for- mer pow6r either by sea or land. Her colonies one after another declared and maintained their independence, or were:seized and held by some of the great naval powers, leaving her nothing but the island of Great Britain over which she could exercise authority. Even there the dem-   240     THE MONK OP THE MOUNTAINS. ocratic principle soon prevailed, and through agrarian laws, and laws abolishing primogeniture and entail, divested her royalty and nobility of their wealth and pos- sessions, and virtually establishing a republican govern- ment. "All these results are but the natural consequences, the legitimate though bitter fruits of the policy pursued 1yv the governing power of this nation-the nobility and aristocracy of the land. Men often change, but princi- ples never. The same causes that have produced the downfall of other nations, have caused the ruin of this. "As the demoralization of wealth, and the arrogance of Power in the few, destroyed the once mighty Assyrian empire, the commonwealths of Greece, and the republic of Rolle, so the same causes have produced the same effects on the once great and powerful kingdom of Great Britain. With all these nations the exaltation of the few, through the legal oppressions and enslavement of the many, has been the object of the governing classes, and upon all has brought the same disaster and ruin. In matters of government men seem to learn slower than in any other science, and on many vital points appear hardly to learn at all. Had the oligarchy of Eng- land been warned by the fate of the nations that have flourished and fell in the far distant past, they might have retained their supremacy, and the nation still have been a irreat and powerful people. But it was not so ordered, 1and the fate of this country only furnishes another evi- dence that God is just, and that retribution, however slow, never fails of its purpose. "But. though the sun of England as a military or naval power, has thus forever set, she still has a record of which her children may well be proud. It was on her soil that   ENGLAND.  241 the battles of constitutional and religious freedom were first fought and won; it was by her statutes that the Afri- can slave trade was declared felony, and punished as such; and through her wise and benevolent measures, that the enslaving the negro was made odious throughout the civilized world. "While she has produced a Clive and a Hastings, she has also given birth to a Wilberforce and a Clarkson; and although she subjugated India and Hindostan, she gave them a better code of laws, and a more human religion: and while her bench has been disgraced by a Jeffreys, a Scroggs and a Norberry, it has also been illuminated and honored by a Mansfield, a Hale and a Blackstone." Here my friend paused, and after regarding me a few moments, observed: "You are fatigued by our day's labor, and we are not yet through our investigations. Let us now return to the cottage, and to-morrow resume and complete our view and consideration of the nations of Europe; though in consuming one more day here, I shall be compelled to forego a trip I had in view with you to another part of Paradise."   243       THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS.

As nothing of importance occurred on our way to the cottage, or during the evening or night, I shall resume nv narrative on our arrival the next morning at our point of observation on the shores of the great ocean. Before placing the telescope in my hand, my friend remarked that he would add a few observations to what he said yesterday in relation to the downfall or revolution  of the government of Great Britain. "The people of England," said he,-' the great masses of the nation-constitute the most valuable population in the world. They are naturally honest, industrious, faithful and reliable; and had they been properly treated by their superiors-the governing classes-would have   ENGLAND. 243 been the most brave and patriotic people in the world. But what inducements had they to be either brave or patriotic in the defence or protection of the honor of their country, when they were denied all participation in its government, and virtually prohibited from acquirin property in the kingdom. This disability may not be the condition of every individual of the nation, but so large a proportion of the people were disfranchised by the laws as to depopularize the government and make it a close corporation. "The consequences of this policy were to make the rich richer, and the poor laboring man poorer; to drive the most valuable part of the population-the enterprising and industrious--to emigrate to other lands, where their manhood would secure them the respect and rights of citizenship, and where they could obtain property in the soil ;-and to reduce the thriftless and irresolute to lope- lessness and despair, to idleness, intemperance and pov- erty; so that the people of England, before the last rev- olution, were fast resolving into the two extremes of inordinate wealth and degraded indigence-the lordly mansion on one side, and the parish work-house on the other. This result from the policy pursued was inevita- ble, and its full development was only a question of time. While the vigorous, productive middle classes were going abroad to enrich and populate other lands, the worn-out, effete and imbecile were left at home, a charge upon the nation. "This was the condition that England found herself in- volved in through the blindness and obstinacy of her rul- ing families; and as the difficulty was too intricate. to be unraveled, the people concluded to cut it asunder by a revolution.   244      TIE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. Let us now take a view on the other side of the chan- nel, and see how our friends are prospering in France. They have been republicans so long that they find no difficulty in conducting that kind of government. By reinoving the seat of their power from Paris to a more cenltral, but less populous location, and converting their dlitlerent departments into States, with local legislatures and governors, for local business, after the American plan, France has become a well-established and success- fill republic; securing peace, happiness and prosperity to ier citizens. In a military view she is highly respectable, as all hier men are trained to arms; but as a naval power slie is not so strong as some of her neighbors. In the arts of peace and pursuits of science she excels most otlher nations, and in these finds her greatest profit and advantage. Her population numbers about seventy mil- lions. * "Spain is still a bigoted despotism, and has made less progress in civilization, intelligence and liberty for the last hundred y-ears, than any nations in Europe. She mav lbe regarded as one of the old landmarks of mon- ar'hy, and by the contrast she presents to other nations of the world, shows how rapidly mankind are improving. "Italy, Austria and Prussia, after absorbing and revo- lutionizing many of the smaller States, have themselves been revolutionized by their subjects, and are now repub- lican in their forms of government. "TThe smaller kingdoms, principalities and duchies, constituting the Germanic Confederation, have consoli- dated into larger nations, thereby cheapening their gov- ernments, and are now republican in their character. The latter remark will apply also to Belgium, the Nether- lands, and the small nations of the north. For although   VARIOUS NATIONS OF EUROPE.     245 not strictly republics, they are all constitutional govern- ments, and so liberal in their principles as to be classed among the governments of the people. "The Russian empire we have already considered, and it is only necessary to add, that by conquest and purchase she has acquired some of the most valuable provinces of Turkey, and is now mistress of both shores of tie Darda- nelles and the city of Constantinople. 'Turkey as a political power on the earth, has nearly disappeared, and what little vitality yet remains with her, is from the religious fanaticism which still inspires the followers of the prophet." My friend, who had all this time retained the telescope in his hand, now gave it to me, with the remark that he thought I would understand the condition of the nations of whom he had conversed, better by description than by occular observation; and, therefore, had not given me the trouble of a personal survey. ' You are now, however," said he, "to consider a coun- try of wider extent; and with which you are better ac- quainted. In order to fully understand the present con- dition of your own country, you will require a personal view." As I raised the glass to my eye and swept over the map of my widely extended country, I could again see that great changes and improvements had taken place in its appearance. Especially was this the case on the southern mainland, and on the islands of the West Indies. On the mainland, from ocean to ocean, the whole coun- try seemed but one continuous extent of vineyardsi orchards and gardens. From the valleys even to the very tops of the. mountains, was exhibited a degree of cultiva-   246     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. tion and splendor of buildings seldom seen in anylof the old countries of the world. The islands presented equal evidence of improvement and wealth, with the addition of numerous extensive hotels on the sides and summits of the mountains, which appeared to be swarming with throngs of happy people. My friend now observed that these islands had be- come the favorite residence of large numbers of wealthy inhabitants, and the winter resort of travelers and sojourn- ers, wlho seek this delightful climate from all parts of the North American continent and Europe, for health and recreation. All along the shores of these islands were large and populous cities and towns, and in the harbors numerous merchant ships, giving evidence of the extent of com- merce carried on with other portions of the world. iThese islands, though detached from each other," said nm friend, "possess elements of wealth and greatness sufficient for an empire, and constitute three States of the American Union." In glancing again to the mainland, I observed that ships of the largest class were passing and repassing from the Carribean Sea to the Pacific Ocean through a canal tiat connected these waters. On following with my eye the course of the canal, I noticed that a considerable por- tion of its length passed under high mountains, and that the ships seemed to sail through the tunnel without un- shipping or taking down either masts or spars, and some- times without even taking in sails. On turning to my friend for information, he informed me that this canal had been completed about twenty years; that the tunnel was some twenty-one miles long, and was lighted with magnesium lights from one end to   VARIOUS NATIONS OF EUROPE.     247 the other; that its hight was sufficient for any ship to sail through without unshipping her masts, and was wide enough for vessels to pass each other, or for two to sail abreast. "Wherever the rock," said he "was not found' to be perfectly solid, an arch was constructed over the way, so that vessels pass under the mountain with as much safety as they could sail on an open river or the ocean. "The construction of this work, which was by an incor- porated company, has proved one of the greatest specula- tions of the age. Not only was gold, silver and other metals found in quantities sufficient nearly to pay the whole expense of the enterprise, but since its completion the tolls from the ships of all nations which pass through it, reimburse its cost every two years. Already there are two rival canals being built, farther north, one of which will be completed for business during the present year." In sweeping the glass over the map of the country, I could see that the whole face of the land' seemed to swarm with people as a hive swarms with bees. From the north to the south; from the east to the west; on the moun- tains and in the valleys; on the land and on the water, everywhere; all seemed but one grand panorama of life, animation and gladness. The ocean, lakes and rivers appeared alive with the' commerce of the country; and even the air and clouds presented scenes of bustle and activity. "As this is the last opportunity," said my attendant, "which you will have of observing the result that time' will produce (or from yourpresent stand-point has pro- duced) on the condition of the world, it will be well for you to scan thoroughly the scenes before you, and to ask-   248     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. for any explanation that may be necessary to a full under- standing of what you see. "You have now read the future of your country for one hundred years, and if the changes that are to take place ill that short time have somewhat surprised you, it will b)e well to consider the circumstances at the beginning and termination of that period. "At its commencement, the nation was weak in popu- lation and poor in means,-her whole people numbering less than twenty-four millions, and her wealth in still less proportion. It is true she had made some slight advances in science and the mechanical arts, but all she had done up to that time, was rather an evidence of her future capabilities than of what she had already accomplished. '"With her present population of three hundred and fifty millions, and still increasing, aided by machinery and miechanical science, which multiplies her powers of 'production ten-fold - operating on her unbounded re- sources and elements of wealth, --what may not be expected in the way of physical and material elevation in the future? Instead of three hundred and fifty mil- lions, the country is actually representing the power of three thousand five hundred millions of people, in the accolmplishmlent of all that contributes to make a nation great, glorious and powerful. Reflect for a moment, then, on what must be the influence of such vast powers upon the destiny of the nation who has the capacity to wield them! "These powers and this capacity are the legitimate off- spring of liberty and education,-liberty to develope the latent powers implanted by Omnmipotence in the human intellect; and education that teaches the use of such powers in the elevation of man and the advancement of   UNITED STATES.        249 the nation. In the nature of things, a fre and educated people must ever possess great advantages over those who are enslaved or ignorant. "The idea that education and intelligence are only needed by the few, while the masses remain in ignorance, will ever subject the nations who act upon it to their more learned and intelligent neighbors. This superiority will be manifest in war as well as in peace, where an intelli- gent and thinking soldiery will ever have the advantage over the ignorant and thoughtless, or mere fighting ma- chines. What earthly power then can compete in either peace or war with the United States-the mighty Colos- sus of the West! "But while the countrys thus progressing in physical and material prosperity, it is much to be regretted that its standard of morality and religion is not more elevated. This is to be desired, not only as it would promote the happiness of her own people, but on account of her in- creased influence upon other people and nations of the world. "Throughout her broad and populous land there is nothing permanently to reward vice or discourage virtue; and yet vice abounds and virtue languishes. Political corruptions encourage moral turpitude, and while even temporary advantages can be gained by an abandonment of principle and honesty, it is much to be feared that virtue and morality will be held at a discount. "It may be asked, why does God permit these things, when it is so easy for him to control and direct the actions of men, or even to change their natures? To this we can only answer, that God 'acts not by partial but by general laws,' and that he has not disclosed his intentions and   50     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. final purposesn regard to man, even to the inhabitants of Paradise. "That his intentions are that we should be happy, we feel fully assured; and that he will enlighten our minds, and enlarge our understandings, as fast as it is for our happiness that He should do so, is equally manifest to our hope and faith; but to understand the powers and will of Infinity would require infinite intellects, and ours are yet finite. Certainly our minds are greatly enlarged from whlat thev were in the world of flesh, and we feel that our natures are purified and changed; but there are still bounds to our knowledge, and outside of these bounds all is mystery. "Pass the glass again over 'the panorama of the lower world.' continued my friend, "and see if there is any sub- ject onl whichi you would like to receive further informa- tion before we finally retire from this post of observa- tion:." Airain I raised the mysterious tube to my eye, slowly passing it over the panorama before me,but as I saw notling of especial note that I had not already seen and had explained to me,--with a mingled feeling of regret that my investigations into the future were ended, and of gratification that I had been permitted to look even thus far into the future-I surrendered the instrument for the last time into the hand of my friendly attendant, and an- nounced my readiness to accompany him to my lodgings. As he received the glass from me he observed: "You have had a privilege granted to you which has been ex- tended to but few mortals before you, through which you have seen what has always been desired to be known by the children of men-the events of the future." He now took my arm, and as we rose into the air the   UNITED STATES.        251 usual darkness and insensibility came over me, from which I did not recover until our near approach to the cottage, This evening my friend proposed to dine with me, and gave his orders to our servitor out of my hearing. When our entertainment was announced, and we took our seats at the table, I was surprised at the great display of lux- uries that was spread out before us. It was certainly the best spread table that I had seen in Paradise. Among other extras we found a plentiful supply of the holiday nectar, to which we paid our respects in flowing bumpers, until a late hour in the evening. I had never seen my friend in so happy a mood or in such high spirits, either in the lower world or in Para- dise, as he seemed to be on this occasion. He drank toasts and sung songs, cracked jokes and indulged in bon mots, until I began to think that the holiday nectar of which he had imbibed, had not only cheering and exhili- rating powers, but if taken too freely might produce other effects. Occasionally he would become extremely friendly and confidential, relating to me many incidents of his for- mer clerical life, with anecdotes of other ministers of reli- gion, with whom he had been acquainted. Most of these related to the pious frauds and deceptions that preachers were under the necessity of practising, in order to meet the ignorance and superstition of their flocks. "One itinerating Methodist preacher," said he, "that I knew very well, used to boast that in winter he preached that hell was extremely cold, and that heaven was warm and comfortable; but in summer he reversed the order, and taught that heaven was cool and pleasant, and that hell was a lakefof fire and brimstone. How he got along   '252     THE MONK OF TIIE MOUNTAINS. in spring and fall I could never imagine, for I saw no practical way of averaging the extremes." Thus we passed the evening in hilarity and mirth, dur- ing all which time not one word was spoken on the sub- ject of mny return to the earth. Once or twice during the day my friend had incidentally mentioned that my visit was (drawing to a close, but throughout this whole even- ing lie seemed to have cautiously avoided the subject. Just before the hand of the clock reached the hour of twelve, he proposed another goblet of nectar, and as we sipped it from time to time to prolong its enjoyment, he continued to relate his amusing recollections ; but on our emptying our glases his manner suddenly changed, and he became grave and thoughtful. We now, at his suggestion, took seats on the veranda, where we had hardly seated ourselves before I felt an unusual drowsiness come over me that I could not shake off, and for which I could not account. The last that I canl recollect, my friend was still talking, the nightingale and otlher birds were singing amid the branches of the surrounding trees, and the rolian harps were breathing forth their most quieting and soothing sounds. How long I slept I have no idea, but on awaking I found myself in my cave on the mountain-the day just breaking in the east, and my friend standing by me. Addressing me in the kindest accents, he said: "I have returned you again to your home on earth. You will find all things safe and as you left them. Be not despondent, we shall shortly meet again." I was about to reply, and ask for some explanation, when on looking up I discovered that he was gone.   RETURNS TO EARTH,        23 CHAPTER XXXI. IS LtNIIAPPY AT BEING RETURNED TO EARTH - DISCOVERS ANOTHER MRACLE-WlRITES HS LIFE AND EXPERIENCE--PRAYS FOR DEATH -BUT LIVES FOUR YEARS--rEELS THAT HS END IS APPROACHNG. "O, death! the poor man's dearest friend, The kindest and the best I Welcome the hour my aged limbs Are laid with thee at rest!" -Burns. "Death's but a path that must be trod, If man would ever pass to God." -Parnet. NOTWITHETANDING I had been looking forward to the time I should be returned to the earth, and to my lonely cave, with feelings partaking of both pleasure and pain; yet, when I found myself alone in my desolate dwelling, my heart sunk within me, and all life and energy seemed for a time to be suspended. After sitting for awhile like one ii a trance, endeavor ing to collect my scattered senses, I walked forth upon the mountain just as the sun was rising on the clear, beautiful autumnal morning, and strove to arouse my dormant energies and resolutions, so far as to enable me to perform the duties which I felt were incumbent on me. I could not but regard it as a duty to impart to the world what I had seen and experienced during the last few days, and such I knew was expected of me by my friend, who had been instrumental in obtaining for me the informatiofi. Still my impatience to join my family and friends in Paradise was so great and overpowering,   254     THE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. *4 that I could not restrain the wish for immediate death; and I am mortified to say that my mind even adverted to the subject of suicide. These despondencies, however, were momentary, and soon gave way to more elevated and devotional feelings. After walking about for some time in the open air, en- joying the invigorating morning breeze, and reflecting tlhat my stay upon earth at the longest would be but short, I reconciled myself to go immediately to work in writinl a narrative of my life and experience, for the benefit of mankind. But here a circumstance occurred that for a time con- fused and perplexed my thoughts to a degree that almost disqualified me from connected or rational reflection. As I approached my dwelling on my return from my morning,'s walk, I met a neighbor who saluted me with a familiar and friendly "good morning;" and on my return- ing the salutation, he kindly enquired how I had passed the niglit after my long ramble yesterday on the moun- tain. I informed him that I had not been on the moun- tain, nor in fact at home for the last three weeks-that I lhad been out of the country, on a long expedition in other lands. His reply was, that I must be dreaming, for that he certainly met me on the mountain only yesterday, and had a long conversation with me. Now it was true that on the day before the night I was taken to Paradise, I had met this man and had a conver- sation with him under the circumstances he had described; but in the meantime I had been the subject of a great miracle, and had passed some twenty days of the most interesting incidents that I had ever experienced in life. As lie insisted so confidently, however, and with so much candor, that our conversation took place only yesterday,   CONCLUSION.        255 -giving me the day of the month and week both then and now, which certainly confirmed his statement-i began to reflect whether it was possible that I could be mistaken in my opinion--rather knowledge-of having passed the last three weeks in Paradise. Without any further explanation to my neighbor, I re- solved to seek other evidence, to confirm or contradict my convictions. On examining my fireplace I found the coals and embers fresh and burning, which certainly seemed to indicate that a long time could not have elapsed since they had been replenished with fuel. After passing some time in a state of hazy doubt and uncertainty, I concluded that if time in Paradise had been extended and prolonged to me, while it had re- mained stationary in the lower world, it added but an- other miracle to the many that I had already experi- enced, and proved the truth of the saying of the Turkish Dervise, that "God can make a thousand years appear but a moment, or a moment appear as a thousand years." That portion of my narrative describing the events of my life previous to my translation to Paradise, had been jotted down in notes before that time, and since my re- turn I have only revised and corrected what had already been written, and continued the history to the present period. For four long years have I waited impatiently for the visit of the grim messenger, whose summons is to call me to the companionship of the friends who have gone before me to Paradise. Again and again have I prayed to my Heavenly Father that the days of my pilgrimage on earth may be brought to a close; and that I may be per- mitted to pass the dread ordeal allotted to all flesh.   25)fG    TIlE MONK OF THE MOUNTAINS. that my final hour is at last approaching, I have now in(tlubitaDle evidence, and feel that this night I shall be sulII1ltn)ed to the bar of Omnipotence.    The hand of death is upon me. The world recedes; it disappears! Heav'n opens on my eyes! My ears With sounds seraphic ring: Lend! lend your wings 1 I mount I I fly! O, grave! where is thy victory? O, death where is thy sting?" Here the narrative of the Hermit was brought to a close, and it was soon after his death that his cave was visited by the two young men, as described in the first chapter.
