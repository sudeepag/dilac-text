            PREFACE. 
            WHEN I, some three years ago, commenced the publication of this novel, serially, it was my intention, to divide the same into three parts, and observe all the rules, as far as I was acquainted with them, to make "HANNAH" a literary, even if not a pecuniary, success. I had intended to introduce no characters but such as were essential toward the carrying out of the main plot, which I had designed to have entirely free of all intricacies. As I progressed in this work, new ideas presented themselves to me, which led to the introduction of a by-plot, which, it may be argued, might have been dispensed with without the loast detriment to the development of the main plot. Be this it as it may, I am neither inclined nor prepared to defend the course I have pursued, but would simply state that circumstances of the gravest consequence, and unlooked-for troubles, prevented me from doing justice to myself and the work I had undertaken to write. If I, however, have succeeded in ministering to the pleasure of my readers-if I have been able to dispel some prejudices that, like an impenetrable mist, have kept Jew and Gentile from understanding one another better-if I have been successful in raising the claims of Israel to a partial acknowledgment of its deserts, the chiefest aim of my ambition has been gained, and my labors have been more than recompensed.

                  CHAPTER I. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              O, HOW this tyrant, doubt, torments my breast! 
                              My thoughts, like birds, who, frightened from their nest, 
                              Around the place where all was hushed before, 
                              Flutter, and hardly nestle any more. 
                           
                         
                        OTWAY. 
                      
                   
                  EARTH was robed again in a shroud of gray, and the somber shades of evening rested mysteriously over Cincinnati, the Queen City of the West, as her thousands of palaces which, but one short hour ago, had shone golden in the parting kisses of the radiant sun, now vaguely lifted their marble crests, like tall spectres, through the all-enveloping gloom. Many were the halls that were brilliantly lighted, and the fitful, mellow sheens from the bronzed chandeliers within, contrasted strangely with the pale light of the silver moon, as it ghastly fell on the walls, from without. In a handsomely furnished room, in the back part on the second floor of one of these princely dwellings, sat by the window, with her head pensively resting upon one of her small dimpled hands jeweled with rings of the brightest gems, a lady of something like two and twenty, her deep blue eyes scanning the deeper blue of the starry hemisphere, while now and then a long and deep-drawn sigh would unconsciously rise to her thin and beautifully chiseled lips, followed by a spontaneous gush of tears, which she, however, as if angry at this involuntary display of weakness, would, while a proud disdain curled the corners of her mouth, wipe hastily away, and then, haughtily rising to her feet, pace up and down the floor until, as if exhausted of physical strength or overcome by ill-concealed emotions, she would once more, but now with downcast eyes and drooping head, seek her seat by the window, and, after several more deep-drawn sighs, place her handker chief before her colorless face, and, wildly rocking herself to and fro, shed a shower of tears. Besides herself there was no one in the room save a little boy who lay quiet and motionless on a splendid velvet rug in front of the fire-place, in which fitful rays grotesquely played with the upward curling smoke ascending the chimney. The proud and unhappy-seeming lady we have partly described in the preceding paragraph was just raising her face, upon which the palpable traces of sorrow rather enhanced than otherwise the exquisite loveliness of its features, toward the slumbering child, when the door was noiselessly thrown back upon its tiny hinges of burnished steel by a servant girl, who entered for the purpose of attending to the half-smothered fire, a few flames of which were still flickering in the hearth. No sooner done with stirring the coals, than she was called in a voice somewhat above a whisper, by the pale lady at the window, who now had withdrawn her fond, maternal gaze from the child, and fully bent it upon her servant. 
                  "Jane," she said, as the girl halted a few paces in front of her-"Jane, have you built a fire in the library?" 
                  "No, ma'am." 
                  "No, ma'am?" angrily echoed the lady, the red life-blood rushing for a moment to her cheeks. "Why not? tell me, why not?" 
                  "He said he wanted none as he was going away-" 
                  "Hold your tongue! who asked you whether or no he'd go away? Leave me!" 
                  The poor girl timidly turned upon her heels and was about retiring from the presence of the mistress she had so unwittingly offended, when, after reaching the door, she was again called back, but in a tone which, though by no means tender, had still lost a great deal of its harshness. 
                  "Take this," said the lady, taking off a splendid cashmere shawl she had thrown over her shoulders, and without looking at her servant, handed it to her. 
                  "What shall I do with it, ma'am?" inquired the girl, half suspecting the truth. 
                  "Wear it. Go." 
                  "May God bless your generous heart, ma'am," exclaimed the girl kissing the little white hand, then, after once more looking at the glowing embers in the hearth, stole from the room with as noiseless a step as had fallen upon the floor when she had entered. 
                  "And then he is going to leave!" the lady haughtily soliloquized as soon as Jane had closed the door behind her. "And then he really makes preparations to carry out his threat-to leave! He will not-dare not-can not do it!" and she affectionately gazed at the boy still sleeping on the rug. "No, he will not-dare not," she continued, after a short pause, in which tears, despite her efforts to keep them back, had gathered in the corners of her eyes and now were freely coursing down her cheeks. "I presume he wants me to stoop before him and sue for pardon!" But I'll not do it-no, I'll not. I can be as proud as he, and keep up a show of indifference, which shall soon convince him of the futility of frightening me with such measures, in order to bring me to the shrine of repentance." So saying, she rose once more from her seat, and meditatingly began to pace up and down the floor. After a few seconds, however, she picked up a book that was lying open on the table, and, after throwing herself upon a sofa, breathed a heavy sigh and commenced to read, or at least attempted to do so, for her full blue orbs, over which the long, beautiful lashes hung so dreamily and mysteriously, were now resting upon the leaf-upon a line-without moving, aye, as if they had been riveted to it. And still she saw not-no, even not a word. Her thoughts were absent, and wandered to a theme which haunted her like a phantom in the dark, and despite her strong efforts to conceal, as it were, her mind's depression and uneasiness from her own self, the deathlike hue of her face, the melancholy shade upon her brow, the long-drawn sighs falling from her lips, and the big tears which would involuntarily rush to her eyes, concealed but poorly the stage of her feelings, and indicated too plainly that her young heart had already been made acquainted with sorrow, and, even now, at this moment, was almost breaking under its weight. 
                  Long rested her gaze upon that leaf-upon that line-but conveyed not its meaning to her mind, for she had unconsciously fallen in a profound reverie from which she was at length aroused only by the dropping of the book she had mechanically held in her hand. Slowly she picked it up again, and with another sigh escaping those thin lips which partook in hue of the paleness of her smooth brow, she rose and laid it on the table, then slowly advanced over the rich, soft carpet of Tyrian dye to where the boy lay still slumbering, and, after fondly looking at him for some time, knelt down by the side of him, and covering up her face with both hands, gave vent to her pent-up emotions and wept aloud. A flood of tears gushed down her cheeks, but seemed to bring no relief to her breaking heart, for now she threw herself wildly upon her face, and nothing could be heard save the light breathing of the child and the pitiful wails rising from the bosom of its mother. Just then light steps sounding in the corridor fell upon her ears-she thought them bent toward her chamber. Quick as thought and as light as a fawn, she bounded to her feet, and noiselessly sped to the piano and, after having wiped away the tears from her eyes, hastily ran her nimble fingers over its well-tuned keys and commenced to play a mournful symphony. But the sound of the steps, which had arrested her attention and for a moment caused her to appear forgetful of her sorrows, eventually died away, and with disappointment visible in every lineament of her face, she gradually lowered her head upon her bosom and once more the tears gushed from her eyes. The piano was abandoned-there was to her at present no music in that instrument-she repaired again to her seat by the window, and, leaning her head upon her hand, looked pensively into the far and liquid fields of ether, and gazed abstractedly at the blinking of the myriad tiny stars suspended in the deep darkness above her head. She espied a small white cloudlet sailing in the vast gray horizon, hiding for a moment the silver face of the moon, and a strange, cold sensation crept over her frame as she watched its slow but sure progress. Soon, however, it moved on, and the moon still hung apparently on the same infinite ocean of murky gloom, with her translucently white face as calm and serene as before. She drew a long painful breath and turned down her eyes. Rising from her seat she moved to the opposite side of the room, gently rung the bell which communicated with the servants' apartment, then once more took her position by the window. 
                  "Do you want me, ma'am?" inquired Jane, who shortly after stood before her mistress. 
                  "No," replied the lady, still appearing to look through the window. "Yes, yes, trim the fire," she at length added, absent-mindedly-"it is very cold." 
                  With a dubious expression upon her face Jane went to do as she was bid, but found the fire brightly burning in the hearth, and keeping the room in a very comfortable state of temperature. In order to please her mistress, however, she stirred the glowing embers bers in the grate, then, laying down the poker by the mantle piece, was about receding when the lady turned around and motioned her to approach. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "What would you, my lady?" 
                  After a short pause-" Nothing." 
                  "Would you have me stay in your room, my lady?" 
                  "No!" was the cold reply, and the calm dignity on her brow and the imperiousness expressed in that "No!" concealed successfully the bitter conflict within, and the weakness of her own nature. 
                  "Shall I withdraw then?" 
                  "Yes. Haven't I told you so? Go!" she replied harshly, and once more looked out into the deep, dark blue skies-looked at the still calm, pale, serene moon, and-breathed a long sigh.-"Jane." 
                  But Jane was gone. The bell was rung again, and soon after answered by the appearance of the girl. 
                  "Jane, I was harsh to you." 
                  "No, my lady." 
                  "But I know I was, Jane." 
                  The girl bowed her head and remained silent. 
                  "Don't mind it, Jane. Here," and she pressed some coins in the girl's hands, "buy you a pair of good winter shoes to-morrow. Now go." 
                  "But, my lady, you only yesterday gave me a pair of excellent shoes." 
                  "Go, Jane." 
                  Again the lady was alone. Her pride forsook her; her appearance of calm, so well kept up in the presence of her maid, now gave way by degrees, her bosom began to heave, sighs became more frequent, and, soon after, she was again in tears. She knelt down by the side of her child, with her head buried in both her hands, and sobbed aloud, now and then exclaiming in the deep agony of her soul, "My God! For nearly an hour she remained in this attitude, when, fairly exhausted and her eyes grown dim from weeping, she gently pressed a fond kiss upon the serene brow of the sleeping child, then rose to her feet and with an abstracted air walked up and down the room several times, then stopped before the window, and aroused herself, drew another long breath, riveted her deep blue orbs once more upon the child, stepped lightly across the room, and for the third time the bell was rung, and for the third time Jane stood in the presence of her mistress. 
                  "Jane, it must be cold and unpleasant out of doors. I can feel it even here. It must be very unpleasant." 
                  "Yes, yes, it is." 
                  A silence of several minutes ensued. The lady looked into the azure blue-the servant at her mistress. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "My lady." 
                  "Did you not say it was damp and unfriendly out of doors?" 
                  "I did, my lady." 
                  "You did-I thought you did," she lisped abstractedly. 
                  Again a silence of some few minutes. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "Ma'am." 
                  "You know-or, at least, you ought to know-he has been ill for some time." 
                  "Who, my lady?" 
                  "Go! leave me!" 
                  The girl was about receding from the room and had already reached the door when she heard herself recalled. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "My lady." 
                  "Damp rooms are unhealthy," 
                  "Very, my lady." 
                  "The library is peculiarly damp." 
                  "I do not think so." 
                  "Jane, you don't know any thing about it." 
                  "I beg your pardon, ma'am." 
                  "The library is unhealthy." 
                  The girl did not venture again to express her opinion, and now another pause ensued which was broken at length by her mistress. 
                  "You know, Jane, he has been ill for some time." 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  "Cold weather does not agree with his impaired constitution." 
                  "No, ma'am." 
                  "You should have known this without my speaking of it." 
                  The girl kept silent and, inclining her head a little, retired a step. 
                  "Go and kindle a good fire in his room; you know he can't pursue his studies in the cold," she added, her eyes bent upon the floor. 
                  The girl had hardly reached the door when the voice of her mistress again arrested her footsteps. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "Ma'am." 
                  "Don't let him know that I have sent you to build the fire." 
                  "No, ma'am." 
                  "Now go, Jane." 
                  Left alone once more she seated herself at the piano and commenced playing a death march. Heavier than usual fell those small fingers upon the ivory keys only accustomed to be lightly tripped over by them. Soon, however, she abandoned this instrument, the dreary notes of which still trembled in the air, for the book she had laid upon the little marble table, to divert, by reading, her mind, forget her grief, and subdue, as much as possible, the depression of her spirit. 
                  It was a futile effort. Her blue eyes mechanically rested on the lines, but her thoughts were not there. They were brooding over her sorrows, whatever they were, and not for a moment could she banish them. Consequently the book was also laid aside, and now-the door opened and Jane reentered. 
                  "Have you built a fire in the library?" 
                  "No, ma'am. He would not let me. He gave me this money," and here she showed a handful of coins to her mistress-"and told me to watch over the boy and be good and kind to him. And as I was about leaving the library he also requested me to say to you, that he would fain see you once more before he went away." 
                  The lady's face for a moment glowed crimson, but soon the warm blood rushed back to the heart, and her cheeks turned as pale as that of a corpse, when the girl added: 
                  "Shall I tell him to come in?" 
                  "No!" And after a short pause she murmured to herself: "What! can he really be serious, and leave me and this boy? No; I don't believe him so inflexible-he will not go-but if he should?" Here her thin lips began to tremble, and that expression of pride vanished from her brow. 
                  "Shall I tell him to come in?" asked the girl for a second time, as if she had not already heard her mistress' reply in the negative. 
                  "No." 
                  "I'm sure he would like to kiss the boy before he goes away," said the girl timidly. 
                  "And what is that to you?" haughtily replied her mistress. "Leave me! Go!" and Jane, without risking another word, retreated from the room. 
                  Solitude is an inexhaustible source of happiness to those whose minds are free from care and trouble-to those whose Past has been an uninterrupted dream of bliss, still resting over the Present and throwing its radiant kisses even into the uncertain Future. But those who grieve over errors committed, whose minds brood over happiness wantonly destroyed, whose hopes are blasted and buried in the Past, the shade of solitude is a torture keenly felt, for then the mind leisurely turns within itself and calmly reviews the dark and gloomy picture time and fancy has wrought upon it-a torture, which only in the din of the world and in the excitement of the hour abates and loses its sting. 
                  After Jane had retired from the room the lady looked abstractedly at the fire in the hearth, and for some time watched the bright flames as they grotesquely shot from the fuel and twined their graceful waves around the curling smoke-cloudlets ascending from some expiring embers. 
                  Just then the clock struck nine-the lady shrank within herself, as if it had been a death knell. Slowly she moved the soft palm of her hand across her forehead to collect her thoughts, then rose, walked to the door, and rang the bell. This simple summons must have cost her considerable pain, for tears started to her eyes as she once more, with head bowed down, retired to her seat. 
                  "Do you want me, my lady?" said Jane entering. 
                  "Yes.-Stir the fire." 
                  Jane did as she was ordered. 
                  "Any thing else, my lady?" 
                  "No.-Jane!" 
                  "My lady." 
                  "Have all retired?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  "Has he, too, retired? Is the light extinguished in the library?" 
                  "I don't know, my lady." 
                  A lapse of several minutes ensued. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "Ma'am." 
                  "Discover whether or not the light in the library is extinguished." 
                  Jane tripped lightly out of the room. In a few minutes she stood again by the side of her mistress, who accosted her: 
                  "Well-" 
                  "The light is still burning," said the girl. 
                  "Do you think he wants to see the boy?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am. I'm sure he would like to see the boy. May I call him?" 
                  "Do as you please." 
                  "O, he will be so glad to see him once more," and she turned to withdraw. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "What, my lady?" 
                  "You know the boy has asked for him at supper." 
                  "I shall tell him so." 
                  "Jane." 
                  "Ma'am-" 
                  "But tell him nothing more. Now go." 
                  O, how her heart ached-throbbed within her bosom, as she now sat by the window, with book in hand, waiting-listening for his footsteps. But look! look! how pale-how ghastly she turns! 
                  What change has taken place? 
                  Jane had returned, and in her downcast face the lady had read her doom with horror. A wild shriek of despair escaped her thin lips as the trembling girl rather muttered than said: 
                  "He is gone!" 
                  "Gone!" 
                  "Yes, ma'am," replied the girl, her voice sinking to a whisper, "I found the room deserted and the light extinguished." 
                  The lady looked like a marble statue. Not a muscle stirred. Her eyes were bent on vacancy. But see I this unnatural calm subsides-a mighty storm arises. Her delicate form shakes like an aspen leaf. Her bosom heaves with strange emotions. Her lips quiver and contort her features. A convulsive spasm-a wild shriek of despair-her face is buried in her hands: nature proved stronger than pride, and the haughty lady sobbed aloud. 
                  O, pride! O, pride! how many are thy victims! From the palace to the cottage, from the king to the peasant, thy baleful influence reaches. How many tears would have been spared, how many sighs would have remained unborn, by the use of a single word! How many errors might have been corrected, how many misunderstandings cleared up, had pride not sealed her lips!

                              SHE stands, as stands the stricken deer 
                              Check'd midway in the fearful chase, 
                              When bursts upon his eye and ear 
                              The gaunt, gray, robber, baying near 
                              Between it and its hiding place- 
                              While still behind, with yell and blow, 
                              Sweeps, like a storm, the coming foe.

                  READERS! It will be necessary, to better comprehend what we have described in the preceding chapter, and in order to introduce to you some of the characters destined to play important parts, to turn back something like twenty years in this story, and lead you for a brief time across the Atlantic to a small village in Germany, situated on the river Neckar. It was a cold wint'ry night. Snow had fallen heavily during the day and now was lying fifteen inches deep upon the ground. No person, except those the most urgent business drove forth, could be seen upon the narrow and irregular-winding streets; cattle and horses had been carefully stabled, and even dogs had been allowed to take shelter inside of the houses, where the rigid cold could not penetrate with its fingers of ice. The heaven was unusually calm, and the little, twinkling stars never looked clearer-brighter-colder. The full, white moon, whiter even than the unsullied snow upon the ground, threw her heatless rays upon the roofs of those quaintly, old-fashioned German buildings with their small, narrow windows; and from the low chimneys dense clouds of dark gray smoke sailed gracefully upward. 
                  It was long after the hour in which the daily laborer and mechanic seek the comforts, such as they are, of their humble home, when, with a bundle thrown over his broad shoulder and heavily resting upon his back, a man large and athletic in body, fitted and accustomed to vigorous exertions, might have been seen, slowly and solitarily plodding his way through the deep layer of snow into a narrow lane where, judging by the appearance of the old buildings frowning in their dilapidated condition upon each other, the poorer class of citizens resided. 
                  Having proceeded some little distance up the lane, he threw the bundle from off his shoulder, and raised his body, which effort, however, seemed to cause him pain, to an erect and dignity-expressing position. The pale light of the moon played dimly upon his brown face, and hued it with the shade of death. He was apparently in the Meridian of life, his powerful structure indicated great physical strength, and his physiognomy, by no means unprepossessing, was peculiarly that of the Jewish race. His brow was large and broad, overlooking a pair of black eyes in whose steady glance could be read: pride-determination-a spirit that does not love to brook restraint, insult or humiliation. The shape of his nose was more Roman than aquiline, and expressed more firmness of character than loftiness of nature. His lips were full and thick, and, being compressed so that they, to some extent, sharpened if not distorted, the already strongly-marked lines of his cheeks, more than aught else gave that countenance an expression of firmness and decision of which every feature seemed singly to partake. Now, as he stood there behind that bundle, with his arms firmly knit across his broad chest, the pale light of the moon playing upon his face, a dark frown might be seen furrowing his brow and sharpening the steady glance of his eyes. How sad, dejected and melancholy! Sorrows, troubles and cares were intelligibly written in those eyes-that brow-those wan features; and in the peculiar expression of the whole one glance was sufficient to discover that he was tired of life, and long since must have lost all hopes of ever enjoying it again. Once more he raised the bundle from the ground and threw it over his shoulder, then resumed to plod his way through the deep, unbroken snow. A short distance from where the lane took a turn stood a large two-story dwelling, built of square-hewn logs, painted red, and big stones laid upon each other and cemented with mortar. As he neared this dwelling he slowly raised his form, which bent forward from the weight resting upon his back, and longingly turned his eyes toward the windows of the second story. Some one looked through the pane of one of those windows, but soon disappeared, and, a moment later the house-door was opened by a lady, and the weary, solitary stranger silently crossed its threshold. Let us follow them up two flights of stairs, and enter with them a room of considerable dimensions, the temperature of which indicated no extravagance in the consumption of fuel. A tin lamp, filled with oil, was burning upon a table alongside the white-washed wall, throwing a dim light over the furniture, which, though no longer new, was still, so to use the term, in excellent trim, and indicated by its grade that its owners had seen better days. The chairs and the table were of polished mahogany, the bureau and wardrobe of cherry, and the linen, spread over the two bedsteads, was cleanly washed, starched and of excellent texture. The several pieces of furniture were properly disposed and tastefully arranged, occupying no space which could inconvenience the family in its movements. The floor was nicely scrubbed and strewn over with a peculiar kind of sand the peasant-girls dig up a short distance from she town and bring to market, which is bought and used by the poorer class of Germans to preserve the cleanliness of the floor. To the right of the door, in close proximity, but in other houses more frequently attached, to the wall, stood the stove, which was fed from the oven in the kitchen. The stove was in the shape of an oblong chest, three feet wide and nearly five high, was manufactured of clay, such as potters use, and glazed a beautiful dark brown. On one of its sides an iron door was attached, covering an aperture in which meals were cooked and warmed. 
                  Having thus taken a cursory view of the room and its furniture, we will now introduce to our readers its respective occupants. 
                  They consist of a lady-the same who had gazed through the window and admitted the wanderer-and her two children. The former was of medium size, with a frame rather delicately constructed, and a face which, though having lost its roundness, still bore the marks of former beauty and loveliness. She had already turned forty, and years of care and trouble seemed to have thrown a veil of sadness over those thin, pale, emaciated cheeks. Her hands were small and white, and seemed constructed rather for play than labor. Her eyes were black and large, and had a meek and steady gaze. They wore an expression of resignation and piety. Her hair, with the exception of some few white intruders, was of a dark brown hue, and combed down her temples and behind her ears, where it was braided and gathered into a crown. She was very graceful in her movements, and held her body in that peculiarly ladylike posture which, in addition to elegant manners, shows good breeding, the early training of the mind, and the respectability of those who watched over her childhood, and were her companions in youth. At the time we introduce her to our readers she was attired in a plain and close-fitting dress of dark brown delaine, and were an apron of white linen, which was tied around her slender waist. A knit woolen cap shielded her head from the inclemency of the weather, and a long comforter, which met twice around her neck, crossed itself in front, and was tied into a knot on her back. On a small bed lay two handsome boys of something near four summers. They were twins, and in their sleep one could hardly be told from the other. Both were of one size, and most wonderfully resembled their mother in features. They had her black eyes and dreamy lashes-her elegant forehead, her glossy black hair, her small Grecian nose, her thin lips and rounded chin. And yet, when they were awake and at play, a close observer might have discovered that, despite this great similarity of features, the expression of the one could not for a moment be mistaken for that of the other. Reuben was the elder and Edgar the younger of the twins. The former inherited from his father an uncouth temper, and even at this early period of his life, gave indications of that indomitable spirit which brooks no restrain and hardly ever listens to the voice of reason. The least thing could aggravate him and provoke his anger, and nothing less than yielding-a submission to his will-would satisfy or calm him. Never for once was he known to give way one jot to his younger brother, and not unfrequently the latter wore for weeks upon his face the marks of the pugnacious Reuben's pugilistic exercises. For Edgar had the sweet, inoffensive disposition of his mother, and was reserved, uncomplaining and-yielding. Love and innocence gave his deep black eyes a soft, languishing expression, and wove a peculiar charm over his beautiful features. 
                  O, when a smile would curl those thin, rosy lips, from under which small teeth, white as the purest snow, peeped forth, and a dimple pressed the pale rose upon his oval cheeks, over which some locks, black and glossy as the raven's wings, were straying, who could withhold his gaze of unlimited wonder and admiration, which its expression of exquisite loveliness, partaking more of the ideal than real, challenged! And still he was not the favorite, if favorite there was, of his mother, though it were doing gross injustice to her even to suppose her capable of not loving the gentle boy. But in Reuben she admired that life-that childish recklessness-which made his eyes light up at play, dance and sparkle, and express a boldness and fearlessness beyond his years. She humored him much, and rather looked into the mirror of his flashing eyes, which reflected upon its bright surface an open heart, susceptible of every impression, as the sequel will show, neither time nor circumstances could obliterate, than into those dreamy orbs of Edgar far more deep, dark and meaningful, seeming to possess already then the rare faculty to read the secrets of others, without exposing or betraying his own. 
                  The stranger whom we have followed into this room was Emil Armhold, husband of the lady who had admitted him, and father of Reuben and Edgar. He was a peddler, and had just returned, after an absence of a week, from some neighboring village, with a heavy bundle of rags. We are loath to stop, even for a moment, at the cause-the primary cause-that excluded men in the latter part of last and in the early part of this century, in civilized(?)-enlightened Germany, from every honorable profession and occupation, because they were Jews, and drove them, in the extremity of their wants, into a path where disgrace and humilation awaited them, and humbled their proud spirit. No other alternatives were left to them: traffic or starve. We will leave this melancholy subject to the historian-to the investigator of causes and effects, and only add that it is deeply felt and to be regretted that not one-no, not one solitary work is extant, where the European Jew and the trials he had to undergo are described with that skill, justness and impartiality both the subject and history are entitled to. 
                  No sooner had Emil Armhold drawn a chair toward the stove and taken a seat upon it, than his wife knelt down before him and assisted him in pulling off his heavy, snow-covered boots, and relieved him of his hat, coat and comforter. All this was done without the utterance of a single word by either. Mr. Armhold looked sulky-his wife anxious and troubled. When feeling more at ease, he lighted his long-stemmed German pipe, and commenced to smoke. In the mean time his wife remained not idle. She spread a white cloth over the table, which she had moved closer to the stove, and served up supper, consisting of hot coffee, rye bread and some boiled potatoes. It was a scanty meal for a man who had been on his feet all day, and, perhaps, had not had a morsel to eat since morning. Mrs. Armhold must have thought so, for she looked sorrowfully upon the table, and tears gathered in her eyes. 
                  "Emil," she said at length, in a low, sweet voice, "come, take your supper now; the coffee will get cold." 
                  After the lapse of some minutes, Mr. Armhold laid his pipe down on the window-sill, then slowly strode toward the table and seated himself on the chair in front of it. His wife poured out the hot coffee, cut the bread into slices and pealed the steaming potatoes. 
                  "Have you already had your supper?" he inquired, without raising his head. 
                  "I have plenty time for mine, Emil," she replied, assisting him to another cup of coffee. He did not touch it, however, nor any thing else upon the table. He left the chair, his meal but half finished. His appetite was gone-he was no longer hungry. The truth started to his mind. There were not enough provisions in the house for the whole family, and she had prepared for him all there was. A dark, dark frown came over his brow, and, with his arms folded across his chest, he now walked up and down the room. Once or twice he halted, and threw an angry glance at his wife, who had seated herself at a little distance from the table and was knitting. 
                  "Rebecca," he said, in a hoarse, deep voice, "take your supper." 
                  "But, Emil-" 
                  "Take your supper!" 
                  Without another word of remonstance, Mrs. Armhold laid down her knitting, repaired to the table, and sipped the cup of coffee she had filled for her husband. It completed her evening repast. She left the bread and the potatoes untouched. She would not rob her husband of his supper. He had worked hard-very hard, she knew it, and her heart wept tears of blood as she scanned the meager treat she had to offer him for his labor. 
                  "Emil," she said, rising, "the coffee and potatoes will get cold if you don't sit down to eat." 
                  "I don't want any thing more." 
                  "O, Emil, sit down and finish your supper," she said, sadly-coaxingly. 
                  "I don't want any thing more." 
                  Silently and sorrowfully Mrs. Armhold cleared off the table, and returned the bread and potatoes to the cupboard. The knitting was again taken up, but her thoughts-oh! her bitter, bitter thoughts!-dwelt not upon that employment now. How her heart beat and her fingers trembled! Now she would raise her eyes, and timidly, frightfully, direct them at the bowed-down form of her husband, who had again taken his seat by the stove, and now held his head between both his arms, which were resting on his knees. An hour passed in this manner, with neither speaking one word. Care, sorrow, poverty, seal the lips and make us dumb. 'Tis true, the sad brow, chastened look, thin, pale cheeks, will be tell-tales, and utter what the tongue would never betray. And it was so now with Mrs. Armhold. One look at her downcast face, and a world of misery was laid bare to the view of the observer, enlisting his sympathy. Still she plied those needles, and still she would gaze at her husband. He had now risen, and was directing his steps toward her. Her cheeks became a shade paler, and her heart palpitated a little faster, but otherwise nothing indicated the terror which had increased in her mind and now convulsed her inner being. 
                  "Did you get the money?" he said, abruptly, as he halted in front of her, bending down upon her a brow wrinkled and frowning. 
                  Oh! how sick she felt! Death would have been relief to her. How could she meet her husband's glance-how could she-his wife-destroy his last hope, and inform him of her poor success!" 
                  "Did you get the money?" he repeated, angrily, observing the hesitancy. 
                  "William refused me the loan." 'Twas said-the terrible truth was out; she felt easier-a stone was rolled from off her heart. 
                  "And William refused you the loan of five guilders?" Mr. Armhold remarked, bitterly, sarcastically, at the same time forcing his fingers through his uncombed, upwardstanding hair. "And this is your brother," he continued, growing more vehement in voice and gesture-"your brother. And so this amounts his generosity! Refuse his sister the sum of five guilders! Does he want you and your children to starve? Say! does he? does he? Why don't you answer me? I know why. Because you are not better than he. You are sneaks-all of ye! heartless less wretches, determined to keep me down-to ruin me! A curse light on all of ye!" 
                  So saying, he strode up and down the room in hasty strides, with clenched fists and eyes that flashed fire. And what was the poor wife doing all this time? What had she to say? Silently and meekly she had listened to those reproaches-not the first she had ever received of him. There she sat-knitting, knitting, knitting. Her head bent down over her work-not once she looked up-she feared to encounter his gaze. His gaze! Is it possible! Those eyes which had had the power to charm, to fascinate her in her youth, those eyes for which she had left a home of wealth and comfort, and confided in the love she saw pictured in them-those eyes now frightened-terrified her. Poor woman! how pale she looked, how her fingers trembled! And still she was calm, not a solitary word escaped her parched lips. This continuous silence, this refraining from complaining and expostulating, instead of allaying the wrath of her husband, rather fed it, and now all the epithets and invectives which he thought would wound and gall her feelings, were applied in order to make her speak-but the broken-hearted woman had nothing to say in return-she remained silent. 
                  "Did you tell him," he continued, in a voice full of bitterness and despair; "aye, did you tell him of your utter destitution? That you had no fuel, no flour, no meat, no potatoes-that you hadn't the money to pay your rent? Did you tell him all this, and he had the heart to deny you assistance? And this is the man whose part you have taken, the man you have always defended! Rebecca! attempt but to speak to him again, or to his children, or to any other member of your family, and, by the God of Israel! I'll tear you to pieces. You-yes, you, are my bitter curse-the cause of all my misfortunes. I have a good mind to strangle you-" and with those words still hanging on his foaming lips, he sprang upon his trembling wife, like an infuriated tiger on his prey, and, while his left hand griped her throat, his right dealt a heavy blow upon her face. 
                  Never until now had he forgotten himself so much as to strike her. He had abused, accused, scolded and cursed her before, but never had he been guilty of violently laying hands upon her body. And now, hardly had the blow been delivered, before the enormity of the crime struck his mind, and remorse-the bitterest of anguish-took possession of his soul, and an unearthly struggle, horrible to behold, and terrible in its magnitude, convulsed his features. He had struck his faithful, loving wife! Misery and despair had made him mad. He had been rich once-now poor. He never had known want-he was hungry now. What was the world to him? It had no smiles-nothing but frowns, frowns, frowns-and he frowned, too. He was dissatisfied with mankind, dissatisfied with his wife-dissatisfied with himself. He had quarreled both with his and his wife's family-he hated them and all those who would not hate them as he did. 
                  And there sat his wife-his own Rebecca, who had so uncomplainingly borne all her trials and afflictions; who never had a harsh word for him; who had been a loving and faithful companion unto him-yes, there she sat weeping, the handkerchief hiding the blue mark the blow had left on her corpse-like cheek. He could not-could not stand the sight. Despite his rudeness and frequent outbursts of anger, he loved that wife-the mother of his children-and rather than to have seen her wronged by others, he would have died himself. Remorse was gnawing on his heart, but still he knew not how to make amends and stop her tears-oh, how they tortured him! 
                  The wrath he had felt for others he now turned upon himself. With the weeping image of his Rebecca before his eyes, he threw himself despairingly upon the floor, and, wildly tossing himself to and fro, plucked out his hair, and shrieked as if ten thousand demons had entered his soul and kindled within it the flames of hell. 
                  On the bed, on the opposite side of the room, raised in a kneeling attitude, could be seen the beautiful Edgar, rising like an angel from a wave of snow. The angry voice of his father had disturbed his light slumber and made him feel sad and uneasy. Noiselessly he had crouched from the side of his brother, and watched, leaning against the wall, the tragic scene from the commencement to the end. The same voice that awoke Edgar had kept Reuben from sleeping. But the latter had not opened his eyes nor raised his head. He had heard all that was said, and now felt like quarreling, and was only angry to have none to pick a quarrel with. At that moment, Edgar, who thought his brother fast asleep, carefully climbed over his body, in order to go to the side of his weeping mother, when Reuben raised himself upon his knees, and, doubling up his little fist, dealt his gentle, unsuspecting brother a blow, which stretched him upon the other side of the bed. Without saying a word, Edgar slided to his place, and once more gazed at his mother-at his father. 
                  Emil Armhold was still groaning and plucking out his hair. Wiping his eyes on her apron, Mrs. Armhold approached him, pressed a fond kiss upon his brown careworn face. This act unmanned him. With the strength of a lion, he now felt as weak as a babe. His heart grew soft and tender, he embraced his wife, and shed a shower of tears upon her bosom. 
                  "O what-what will become of us?" he exclaimed, in anguish. "Are we to starve then?" 
                   
                  "Father! I will not cry for bread again," said a silvery voice, full of sweetness, tenderness and sorrow. 
                  Little Edgar had stolen from the bed, and now knelt by the side of his parents. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER III. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Good Heaven! what sorrows gloomed that parting day, 
                              That call'd them from their native walks away, 
                              When the poor exiles, every pleasure past, 
                              Hung round the bowers and fondly look'd their last, 
                              And look a long farewell, and wish'd in vain 
                              For seats like those beyond the western main, 
                              And, shuddering still to face the distant deep, 
                              Returned and wept, and still returned to weep. 
                           
                         
                        GOLDSMITH'S DESERTED VILLAGE. 
                      
                   
                  IT is currently asserted that Israel has no poor-that the affluent sons of Abraham reach out, at all times, a helping hand to their less prosperous brethren-that their aid tends not only toward the preservation of life, but that also timely assistance is rendered to all deserving, in order to help them to a livelihood and independence. However true this may be now in our own free America, we are bold to avow, however painfully the thrust may come home to some, that, as far as our information extends, the opulent sons of Israel in Germany, like some of their own posterity, and brethren of other creeds here, have, at the time this story opens, spared neither pains nor trouble to make the dependant feel what it is to be an object of charity. 
                  We do not write for praise and popularity; we do not court applause at the expense of truth-at the expense of the interests of those who, owing to their poverty and lack of influence in their humble station in life, have been deemed too insignificant a subject to be treated with the high consideration so many scribblers and sycophants bestow upon the wealthier part of the human family, which, flattered to excess by intellects dragging their creations through the mire, have, in their vanity, almost forgotten the miserable state of their own existence. 
                  How few have treated upon the miseries of Israel's poor! And those who have-how superficially! Who has taken pains to write down their thousand trials-their innumerable sacrifices? Who has opened their bleeding hearts and befittingly brought to view the desolation reigning there? Joys dead, peace destroyed, happiness buried, and hopes extinguished forever! 
                  On the morning following the scene described in the last chapter, Mrs. Armhold might have been seen leaving her house at an early hour and plodding her way through the deep snow to that of her brother William. Having repeatedly rung the bell-each time her heart beating afresh-and waited in the cold for several minutes, she was about starting back, when a girl of twelve (her niece, who on this occasion was studiously taciturn) sullenly admitted and conducted her aunt into the presence of her father, who was just then in the counting-room, situated on the first floor and in the rear of the store-room-the upper part of the house being occupied by the family. 
                  Mr. William Loewenthal was snugly seated on a soft-cushiond arm-chair before the well-heated stove, looking intently over a large folio ledger, while two book-keepers were writing at the desk, with their backs turned toward the door, where Mrs. Armhold, poorly clad and a thin shawl thrown over her shoulders, stood trembling and half frozen, waiting for a favorable moment to address her brother. It eventually arrived. While turning a leaf, he had raised his eyes toward the door. He could not help seeing her. He will most certainly speak to her, and she will have an opportunity to open her heart to him, she thought, and ventured to take another step forward. 
                  But she was doomed to suffer disappointment. Without wishing her a customary "good morning," or inviting her to advance and take a seat by the stove, his eyes were directed once more upon the ledger, and no heed was taken of the lady at the door. This studied, intentional coldness on the part of her brother had no other effect upon Mrs. Armhold than to cause a faint, sad smile to rest for a moment upon her thin blue lips; but in the deep recess of her heart welled up bitter tears, which only by great effort and self-command she had the power to keep from rushing to her eyes. It was William, her own and only brother-William, the companion of her childhood and her youth-who treated her thus. 
                  There was a time they were as one body-as one soul. But now that brother, once so dearly loved, had changed his nature and obliterated the Past from his memory. The milk of kindness had turned to the bitterest gall, and a want of feeling had transformed a human being to a brute. 
                  And for what? 
                  
                     Because she had married the man of her choice against his own will.
                   
                  This simple act had been incentive enough to kindle William's wrath and alienate his affections from his sister; and Rebecca, as she now stood there, gazing at his marble features, painfully remembered the words he had addressed to her on her wedding-day: "From this moment we are strangers: never expect of me a favor. You have married against my will and judgment-prepare yourself to bear the consequences!" 
                  She remembered them and shuddered. A pang shot through her heart. 
                  "Brother," she said, at length, in a faltering voice, "I should like to speak to you." 
                  Mr. Lowenthal closed the ledger, laid it on the desk behind him, leaned back upon his easy rocking-chair, and mechanically looked at the woe-stricken lady standing a short distance from the door. 
                  "What wants Mrs. Armhold at my house?" he said, with that peculiar indifference-that repulsive, freezing calmness-indicative of a callous nature dead to the pleadings of misery. 
                  "I should like to see you in private, brother," she continued, raising her mournful eyes upon the stony features of Mr. Loewenthal. 
                  "I have no secrets from my clerks. What do you want?" 
                  For a moment she gazed at him dubiously. Was it possible that he did not divine, to some extent, the main features of her mission? No: it was barely possible. She had been there but yesterday-had crossed his threshold for the first time in fifteen years, and now her sad, dejected face betrayed that the same motive had brought her once more into his presence. And yet he wanted her-his own sister-the daughter of his mother-to humiliate herself by publishing, like a professional mendicant, her own poverty-her great misery-before those strangers at the desk. Like nine-tenths of the inconsiderate, heartless, pampered rich, he understood not the feelings-the delicacy-the sensitiveness of those who, too, had once seen better days-whose childhood had been all sunshine-who, too, had been honored, respected in their youth, but upon whom, in later years, fortune had frowned-frowned long and incessantly, until the chastened heart had grown sick and weary, and yearned-not for its former happiness-but for death, for peace. 
                  We said, for a moment Mrs. Armhold gazed at her brother dubiously, but discovering not a sign of pity or of feeling in his cold eyes and colder features, she could have wept had tears been at her command; but her sorrow was too, too deep, and she could not weep. A sigh rose against her will, from her surcharged heart, but she succeeded in repressing it, and wetting her thin blue lips, bowed her head, advanced a step, and in a faltering voice-low, calm, and mournful-commenced: 
                  "Brother, I have come to ask of you a favor." 
                  "Mrs. Armhold, I told you but yesterday that I do not like to be molested. I wish to have nothing to do with yourself, your husband, or your children. You would oblige me by leaving my presence at once." This, in a clear, distinct voice, so slowly and dispassionately that his words seemed to have escaped through a passage of ice. 
                  "Brother, my children are in want." 
                  "What's that to me?" 
                  "They cry for bread, and I have none to give them." 
                  "You should impart this information to your husband, not to me." 
                  "O, brother, brother! they are starving." 
                  "What care I? Let them starve." 
                  
                     Let them starve! Like a thunderbolt these words fell upon the ears of poor Mrs. Armhold. For a moment she stood there as if transfixed-petrifled. Not a muscle stirred upon her pale, ashy face, her features were calm, her eyes tearless, and her partly-opened lips wore the impress of death. Soon, however, she recollected herself, and recovered from the rude shock her nerves had sustained. She advanced a few steps, fell upon her knees, raised her eyes and hands imploringly to her brother, and whispered: 
                  "Have pity-O, have pity on my children. They are too young to have offended you. Their father has no money-knows not where to get any. Will you see them starve?" 
                  "Your husband is a lazy scoundrel." 
                  "My brother, he is industrious-always has been so," she replied, sadly feeling this imputation to the quick. "But how shall he make a living for us? Goods he has none-knows not where to get any. The poor man has no credit." 
                  "Let him go begging." 
                  "Begging, did you say?" and Mrs Armhold shuddered from head to foot. 
                  "Why? is he better than any other poor man?" added the feelingless wretch. "Yes, I said, begging. And you, too, have played the lady long enough." 
                  "O, brother! brother!-" 
                  She could say no more; tears rushed to her eyes, and she sobbed aloud. The recollections of the past swept across her memory: her gentle training-her happy school days-her unclouded youth-the tenderness of her mother-the love and care of her father-her early home-O, her dear early home!-and her heart almost broke with the keenest grief. 
                  But what will a mother not do for her children? What sacrifice too great? Mrs. Armhold was a mother, and loved her children with an intensity which consumed all other passions, obliterated all minor considerations, and left her but one thought-her children!
                   
                  "Brother," she cried, "I can not, can not go begging. Spare your mother's daughter from this doom. Help us but this time-only this time, brother-and my prayers shall be yours, aye, to the day of my death. Give me something for my innocent children-you will never miss it-and assist us to leave this place of misery, and I will teach my children to look upon you as their benefactor, and they shall invoke the shades of our parents to intercede for you and yours in heaven." So saying, she lowered her head upon her bosom, and awaited with a palpitating heart the answer which was to revive her hope and life once more, or crush it forever, and drive her to despair. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold," he said, after a short pause, without ordering his sister to rise and take a seat-"Mrs. Armhold, I do not want your prayers nor those of your children. I am not to be turned from my purpose in this way. Besides, this interview is getting too protracted: if this is all you have to communicate, I would inform you to remember that charity unworthily bestowed but encourages pauperism, and increases rather than remedies the evil. I will, however, for once act against my own conviction and judgment, and allow you to work upon my tender feelings. Here are the five guilders," handing her said sum, which she grasped eagerly; "take them, do with them whatever you choose, only promise never more to cross my threshold." So saying, he rose from the chair and was about leaving the counting-room, when Mrs. Armhold also rose to her feet, and taking hold of his hand, pressed it between her own, and raised her now tearful eyes to his face, saying: 
                  "Brother, brother, do not leave me thus. Hear me out-O, hear me out. It is your sister Rebecca who appeals to you. I have but few more words to say-that's all, and I will leave you: my presence shall never again offend you." Seeing that he still hesitated, she continued, full of pathos: "Are you not my own brother-the very same who once loved to call me this gentle sister? Am I not your own Rebecca-the sister who in her youth shared with you the blessings of one father-of one mother? O, happy were we then!" and here she buried her face in her apron-"no cares, no troubles-all sunshine. I have suffered much since then.-O, mother, mother! what has your daughter done to merit this punishment?" and the heart-broken woman gave way to her pent-up emotions, and sobbed aloud. 
                  The two clerks who, against their own inclination, had listened to this colloquy, not desirous longer to witness this interview, made doubly unpleasant, on account of their presence, to her who sought it, with the delicacy of a truly refined nature, availed themselves of the first opportunity to leave their business, though unfinished, at the desk, and unconcernedly passed from the room. 
                  Mrs. Armhold was now alone with her brother. Once more she reminded him of her utter destitution; once more she knelt down before him-he had seated himself again in his easy arm-chair-and begged him, with tears streaming down her pale cheeks, to have pity on her-on her children-on her husband.
                   
                  "Don't speak to me of your husband, and I shall feel more inclined to listen to you," he said, requesting her to rise and take a seat by his side. 
                  "No, no," she pleaded; "here, brother, here, at your feet, I will kneel a suppliant, until your mother's daughter has been heard and pitied by you." 
                  For the first time he allowed his eyes to rest for a moment on her countenance. They caught her own-so sad, chastened, and tearful; they beheld her pale, thin cheeks, which once had been full, rosy, and smiling, and for a moment the fond old days came back to him-the happy days of childhood, and he felt some remorse, some compunction-was once more human.
                   
                  "Sister-" 
                  She would not-could not hear the rest. She had heard enough. He had called her "sister"-"SISTER," as of yore-and for a moment she seemed to see again the forms of her father-her mother-O, her mother! She thought herself once more a little girl by her side, and she wept, sobbed-sobbed and wept, as if that mother were really there, could read her sorely afflicted heart and its terrible anguish. But she was not there, and Mrs. Armhold wept the more. 
                  "Now tell me what it is you want me to do for you?" continued Mr. Loewenthal, rather short and abruptly, and betraying, both in his voice and feature, very little of the sympathy and feeling the appellation "sister" warranted her to expect. 
                  "Help my husband-" 
                  "If you do not wish to offend me," he interrupted her, "mention not his name. We have disliked each other-have been enemies from childhood. I hate him." 
                  "Do not hate him, brother. He is still my husband-the father of your sister's children." 
                  "Yes, yes, he is your husband, and it is that much worse for you. The wretch! He once-once!-ay, a hundred times-has nicknamed me in public. He has spoken against me and my family-has even threatened to kill me. And you have the audacity to come here and ask me to help such a wretch?" 
                  "O, brother, upbraid him not." 
                  "He is a proud, haughty ruffian," continued Mr. Loewenthal. "He carried his head too high for a poor man-for a beggar." 
                  And gentle Mrs. Armhold was compelled to hear this violent tirade of reproaches against her own husband. O, how her heart ached and wept tears of blood as she knelt there a suppliant before a brother's feet. Was it not the father of her children who was thus abused? Was it not the man who had once been kind to her, loved her, and spent the best part of his life with her? Was it not her husband whom she had once known happy-the pride of the village? Ay, was it not he, now forsaken by all his friends, persecuted by cruel Fortune, who was thus slandered? Mrs. Armhold felt the would, and-wept. 
                  "Brother," she said, after a short interval, having partly regained her composure, "I would ask you for a favor: it shall be the last while I live. Grant it, brother; you never shall be pained to see me more; for it does give you pain to see me; my husband shall never more cross your path; you shall be rid of us all forever-ay, forever." 
                   
                  "I do not understand you." 
                  "We want to emigrate to America," and her lips quivered, as if she were struggling to keep up a show of tranquillity. 
                  "Emigrate to America!" Mr. Loewenthal exclaimed, with unfeigned astonishment. "Emigrate to America!" 
                  "Yes, brother;" and Mrs. Armhold no longer concealed her feelings. She buried her head in her stiff, cold apron, and wept aloud. This was the saddest day of her life, and she had seen many sad ones. 
                  "Emigrate to America!" To hear such a remark now, in our present day, would create no sensation; but at the time our story opens, when emigration to distant countries were rare, and when but little, if any thing, was known of America by the German villagers, save that it was a land across the dark, deep ocean, where a free people lived, and whither, now and then, a reckless adventurer turned his step to retrieve his lost fortune, it was a remark well calculated to create the greatest of surprise. For it is not a trifling undertaking, nor one associated with pleasant feelings, to leave forever the house of our childhood, where parents, grandparents, and great grand-parents have lived, died and were buried-to leave all our kindred and bid them a final adieu, to go far, far away-to emigrate from one hemisphere to another-without means, without friends, without a profession wherewith to make a livelihood, when our strength has failed us, and we have grown old-where we meet nothing but strangers, whose laws, language, and manners are foreign to us-we say, it is not a trifling undertaking to tear ourselves loose from all family ties and consign ourselves to as destiny of which we know so little. But when life has lost all its charms, when hopes are dead, when indifference only keeps despair in check, man counts not the dangers, stops not to think, but rushes on-on to an unknown goal, with the convictions a world of care and sorrows has left on his mind: that no fate can be more horrible than the fate from which he is fleeing. 
                  "Yes, brother," continued Mrs. Armhold, sadly, with tears streaming from her eyes, "we have made up our minds to emigrate; but it requires means to defray the necessary expenses and we haven't them. My husband is on bad terms with my family-with his family. He has not the temperament to negotiate peaceably with either-you know he has not-therefore I beg you, my brother, to intercede for us. We are willing to sell every thing we have that is not indispensably necessary for our journey. Do you and they not advance us the balance of the means it may require-we ask no more. Once upon the other side of the Atlantic, we will work, both my husband and myself, until we have earned enough to refund you the outlays in our behalf. God will not forsake us-we shall live to deserve His blessing, and He will bless us." 
                  A silence of some few minutes ensued, in which Mr. Loewenthal was deeply pondering over the proposition of his sister, who was still upon her knees, her sad, tearful eyes strangely appealing to his better nature. 
                  "Rise and go home," he said, at length; "I shall attend to the speedy consummation of your plan. You shall be supplied with the necessary means." 
                  Whether a feeling of compunction, or a desire to remove the family of Emil Armhold out of his sight, actuated Mr. Loewenthal, and enlisted his interest in its behalf, his sister had no desire to penetrate, and we, not being privy to his heart, are not able to read its secrets. 
                  "Promise it-promise it, brother!" she shrieked, a strange gleam of joy lighting up her swimming eyes. 
                  "I promise you my sacred word of honor for its fulfillment." 
                  A half an hour later, and she entered her own dreary room, her eyes still red from weeping, where her husband, a dark scowl shading his brow, was gloomily seated by the earthen stove and smoking his long pipe-the sharer and companion of his dark, melancholy thoughts. On the opposite side of the room sat Reuben and Edgar, playing with wild chestnuts. After laying aside the thin shawl, which had but poorly shielded her body from the cold, Mrs. Armhold gently approached her husband, and handed him the money her brother had given her, saying: 
                  "Emil here are five guilders. Brother gave them to me. Let us buy some bread and fuel now. The children must be hungry." 
                  "Didn't I tell you never more to see and appeal to your brother? But whether I speak or no-" 
                  "O, Emil," she interrupted him sadly "do not scold me, but get something to eat for our children." 
                  Mr. Armhold rose, laid his pipe away, put on his coat, and, grumbling, left the room. He had been gone but a few minutes when he returned with some rye bread and some coffee. The coffee was soon roasted, ground, prepared for breakfast, and steaming on the table. The repast was taken in silence, no one evincing any desire to be communicative. The children furtively glanced, now at their mother, now at their father, and now at each other. Reuben looked sullen-Edgar sad. 
                  "I presume," commenced Mr. Armhold, as his wife was cleaning the table, "this was your business out this morning-to visit your brother. Well, did he listen to your complaints?" he added with bitterness. "Did you tell him, tell-tale, that I have ill-treated you? Did you? did you? You are silent-you won't answer-" 
                  "O, Emil, do not get angry again," she implored him; but he continued with still greater vehemence- 
                  "And five guilders are the reward of your confessions, woman. How it must have pleased him to hear you speak against me! But never mind, I will show you who is master in the house-you or I. You have played the traitoress long enough-I shall quit you and send you back to your cursed family-yes, I shall do it, for you have all conspired against me." 
                  Mrs. Armhold, pale as a corpse, continued attending to her household work, and without a murmer, or reply, listened to those harsh and unjust accusations, for a thousandth time repeated, and for a thousandth time wounding her sensitive heart. She waited calmly until his wrath had subsided, which, as usual, lasted but a few minutes, knowing that arguing with him in his anger would be like throwing coal upon fire. He had seated himself again by the stove, and was brooding over his pipe. Gently she approached him-a bright tear stood in her eyes-and kissed him. It reconciled him. He looked into her face, saw how sad, wan, and pale it was, and his heart smote him for having reproached so meek, so uncomplaining a wife. A long series of misfortunes had soured his nature, and had made him a slave of his passions. Every thing had gone amiss with him; every body had forsaken him; he stood alone in his misery, and imagined, at times, that his own wife gloried in his fall. And yet he loved the mother of his children, and, despite those frequent outbursts of anger, would have died sooner than to have seen one hair of her head wronged. 
                  Now she told him all that had transpired at her interview with her brother, omitting only what was calculated to wound his feelings. Slowly he puffed at his pipe, watching the gray smoke curl upward. Not once he interrupted her-not one remark he had to make. Again she left his side, and went back to her work. He looked at her for some time, and marked her sad, sad face. The man of iron felt a strange sensation creep over his heart. He rose and approached her, took hold of her hand, and, pressing it to his heart, exclaimed: 
                  "Rebecca, for-for-give-" he could say no more, tears rushed to his eyes, and he sobbed aloud. He dropped her hand, and left the room. 
                  'Twas a fortnight after this event-a cold, bitter cold evening-and there was stir and bustle in, about and around the house of Mr. and Mrs. Armhold. Many neighbors were there to bid the emigrants farewell. A small wagon, covered with white canvas, stood at the door. It contained their bedding and clothing, and it soon was to take them-away from home. Many tears were shed, for they were beloved and pitied by those who had known them in better days. Tokens of friendship were given and exchanged, and many words of encouragement came from those kind neighbors. 
                  Every thing was ready-the wagoner was waiting for the order to start. The emigrants descended the steps. The boys were lifted into the wagon; then Mr. and Mrs. Armhold turned around and bade a farewell-a last farewell-to the many people whom they were to see no more. Not a brother, sister, not a single relative, had come to bid the wanderers good-bye, had come to wish them "God-speed." One more look at the old house, one more farewell to their friends, one more parting tear, and the wagon moved away, taking the sad and silent wanderers from the home of their childhood. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him 
                              In Soul and Aspect, as in Age: Years steal 
                              Fire from the mind as vigor from the limb, 
                              And Life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim. 
                           
                         
                        BYRON. 
                      
                   
                  LET us return once more to America-to Cincinnati. Eight long years have passed since the events described in the last chapter, and Mr. and Mrs. Armhold were seated in a small room they had rented in the third story of a large store-house situated across the canal-a locality settled principally by Germans. It was autumn, and late in the evening, and the streets were crowded with mechanics and journeymen leisurely returning to their respective homes. Now and then Mrs. Armhold, who had evinced considerable uneasiness for some time, would rise from her chair and approach the window, anxiously casting her eyes over the crowd and along the street; but, not discovering the object of her solicitude, would breathe a sigh and despondingly return again to her seat, and abstractedly watch the flames in the hearth. As it grew later and darker, she lighted a candle, and placed it on a table which stood in the center of the room. 
                  Let us take advantage of this moment, and see what change time has wrought and impressed upon the features of our emigrants, since we saw them, some eight years ago, depart from the small village on the Neckar. 
                  It required but a single glance at this elderly couple to discover that fortune, which had frowned upon them so many long, long years in their native home, had not yet ceased to persecute them, but still banished joy and happiness from their household. Mrs. Armhold had grown more fragile, and her face was no longer smooth and exhibiting that beauty which had outlived her youth and happiness. Wrinkles had begun to plow her melancholy brow, and that paleness which in her days of tribulation had succeeded the healthy, rosy tint upon her cheeks, was now turned to that yellowish shade in which decay is written, and imperceptibly changing into the hue of death. Her eyes, too, were no longer bright and full. They had a sleepy expression, as if they were tired and disinclined to observe the things of this world, and would rather close the lids and turn the sight inward-inward, undisturbedly to gaze down the long, long and crooked lane from whence the journey of life had been begun, and which was about to draw to a close. And yet she had but reached that period in life which, least of all, is fraught with dangers, and is the season the wife and mother, above all others, enjoys the most. But care, sickness, and trouble, these cankering worms, even more ravaging and pitiless in their devastation than old age, had played sad havoc with her frail and delicate constitution, and made her, in the full sense of the word, an old, decrepid woman before her time. 
                  The change in the appearance of Mrs. Armhold, however great, was comparatively slight and insignificant, to that of her husband. Direct your eyes to the bench by the hearth, and behold that shriveled-up form-that bowed-down figure. It is the wreck of Emil Armhold-of the strong, iron-willed man, now transformed almost into a helpless child. Look at his face; you will hardly recognize it. It wears no longer an expression of pride, haughtiness and determination. The brow is furrowed, the skin wrinkled, and his cheeks sunken. His dark eyes, in whose every glance once shone forth defiance, are now dull, lifeless, and insipid, and have that vague, languishing expression which indicates an existence locked up in itself-an indifference to all objects-a perfect stoic insensibility of the sensations of pleasure and pain. That proud spirit of defiance, conscious of its strength, that boldly dared and feared not to execute, no longer curls his upper lip-no longer expands his chest, and poises his head into an attitude to threaten and command. There is a peculiar apathy pervading his existence, and as he sits there, abstractedly holding a pipe in his shriveled-up hand without placing it to his lips, he appears no longer as one of earth, though still alive and breathing. Like a gladiator he had entered the arena to conquer or to die; like a gladiator he had fought and struggled; like a gladiator he fell, exhausted, wounded, and bleeding; like a gladiator he will be dragged away to the Spoliarium.
                   
                  "Emil," commenced Mrs. Armhold, approaching her husband after she had lighted the candle, "don't you think we had better take our supper now, and let the boys eat theirs when they come? It is late, and you haven't tasted any thing since noon." 
                  Mr. Armhold slowly turned around, passed his hand across his eyes, and inquiringly looked into the face of his wife. 
                  "Emil, will you take your supper now?" she repeated, tenderly. 
                  "Supper!" he said, abstractedly. 
                  "Yes, Emil, it is late." 
                  "Where are the boys?" 
                  "I don't know what keeps them so long today; they should have been at home ere this." 
                  Again Mr. Armhold passed his hand across his eyes, and again he looked at his wife, who was busy at the table. He was now fully aroused from the reverie we had found him in; he had thrown off this morbid drowsiness, this deep, unnatural lethargy, and once more there was an animation in his features, a fire in his eyes a dark scowl on his brow. "You have spoiled these boys," he growled; "they do just as they please. They go where and when they want to, and come back just when they feel like it. I am a dead letter in this house; they no more mind me than if I were a dog. And this is all your doings-no use to deny it-all your doings, wife-no one else's. You have taught them not to mind me"-here he raised his arm and clenched his flst-"and so they do not mind me. I tell you now and again, you have spoiled them, wife. They will not be worth shucks to us; they will let us starve-starve-starve;" and the outstretched arm descended heavily upon the bench, which began to tremble from its weight. 
                  Mrs. Armhold, who, to her great sorrow, knew that her husband was daily growing more quarrelsome, querulous, dissatisfied and peevish, remained silent. She understood his temperament, and was accustomed to bear such, and worse, accusations-fits of rage which, since bodily infirmity had been added to his cares and irritated his passions, had become much more frequent and vehement of late, and generally terminated in one of those spells of apathetic, morbid drowsiness, from which it was a difficult matter to arouse him. 
                  "Yes, they will let us starve in our old days," he continued, after a short pause. 
                  "God forbid!" fell dolefully from the lips of Mrs. Armhold, while tears rushed to her eyes. 
                  "But I shall tell the boys what you are," he said, threateningly-"what a curse you have been to me, and they will cling to me and forsake you. Do you hear that?" 
                  She did hear it, and the big tears that had gathered in her eyes rolled down her wrinkled cheeks, which began to twitch and contract spasmodically, as if chewing-ruminating the pain rising from her bleeding heart. She wanted to speak, but her tongue seemed paralyzed, as if struck by palsy. He misunderstood the cause of her silence, and she was greeted with a shower of curses and epithets, which only increased her misery without allaying his wrath. 
                  At this juncture of affairs the door was unceremoniously thrown open, and a boy of something like thirteen summers entered the room. It was Reuben, the elder of the twins. A single glance at his parents, and he felt convinced that his father had been quarreling again. He stood still at the door, and a dark frown shot for a moment across his youthful brow. 
                  "What is the matter, mother? You have been weeping," he guessed, as he approached Mrs. Armhold, and looked her in the face. 
                  "Nothing is the matter, Reuben." 
                  "But there is, mother. Your eyes are red-you have been weeping. Has father quarreled with you again?" 
                  "Why don't you say 'yes?'" interrupted Mr. Armhold, still laboring under excitement. 'Why don't you say 'yes' at once, you sneak-you hypocrite? You can't deceive me with your crocodilian tears. Don't I know that you have set my own children against me? but I shall tell them who and what you are, and we'll see whom they will believe the sooner, you or me." 
                  "Father, you have again quarreled with mother." 
                  "Hold your tongue, loafer!" 
                  "Father, I shall not hold my tongue," the boy replied, and the red life-blood rushed to his cheeks. 
                  "Do you hear this, woman? Do you hear this?" the exasperated parent shrieked, once more bringing his fist heavily down upon the bench. "The loafer! how he talks to me-to me, his father! Woman! this is your doings. You have taught them to disrespect me-you have taught them not to heed my authority." 
                  "She has not, father," the boy of thirteen replied, at the same time preventing his mother from expostulating. "You wrong mother: she never told me to disrespect you-nor do I. But I am tired of seeing you abuse her so, and I won't suffer it, boy as I am. You have scolded, cursed and whipped her, until I can't bear it any longer. Mother is too good for you-she has never as much as complained or murmured. I tell you, father, if you ever dare to scold again," and here his proud lip curled, and expressed a firmness of character uncommon in a boy of that age-"if you ever scold mother again, I shall take her away from here." 
                  "Aha! has it come to this?" exclaimed the old man, passing his bony fingers through his hair. "Am I to be bearded-threatened by a boy? by a loafer, who runs about the street from morning until night?" 
                  "Well, if I do run about the street-what o' that? Do I not sell papers and bring home the money?-Mother, here is a dollar; I cleared that much to-day;" and he handed Mrs. Armhold the sum mentioned, who motioned him to take a seat by the table and take his supper. 
                  Again Mr. Armhold fell to scolding, and this time with more vehemence than before. Reuben, in giving the money to his mother, had unwittingly wounded his pride. Mrs. Armhold divined the cause of this fresh outburst of anger, and therefore approached her petulant husband, saying: 
                  "Emil, take this dollar and put it in your purse." 
                  "Go out of my sight, woman! I don't want to see you." 
                  The poor woman went back to the table; all attempts to appease her husband seemed futile. 
                  "Mother, have you had your supper?" inquired Reuben. 
                  "Not yet." 
                  "Why don't you sit down now?" 
                  "I shall eat after a while." 
                  Here Mr. Armhold rose from his seat and walked up and down the floor, looking angrily now at his wife, now at his son. 
                  "I'll teach ye-both of ye-to honor and respect my authority," he growled, his eyes flashing fire. "What do you look at me for?" he added, seeing that Reuben had suspiciously watched him for some time. "Here-take this!" and he dealt him, with the palm of his hand, a blow in the face. 
                  For a moment the boy's ruddy cheeks turned as white as snow, and his large eyes, burning in their sockets, were riveted on the receding form of his irritated father, who was slowly moving toward the bench which he had previously occupied. Mrs. Armhold, who still stood beside him, gazed tenderly, compassionately, at the colorless face of her favorite, but sorrow made her dumb and paralyzed her tongue. Reuben felt both angry and wounded. He would have wept had pride suffered it and not sealed the fountain of his tears. He dropped the spoon from his hand and pushed the plate away. His appetite was spoiled, gone; he was no longer hungry. Without uttering a single word, he rose from his chair, left the table, picked up his slouched hat, pushed it over his head, then quit the room and violently slammed the door behind him. He ran down the two flights of stairs, hastened through the long, dark passage, and shortly after made his appearance on the street. He buttoned up his patched jacket to the chin, for 'twas cold, and pulled his hat still closer over his ears. Just then an elegantly dressed boy, of the same size, and, apparently, of the same age, in passing, gave him a violent push with the arm, almost upsetting him. This was an incentive just suited to Reuben's humor. Without a moment's warning, he leaped on the boy, knocked him down, got astride of him, and now the scuffle began. Varied was the success of the youthful combatants; first this one and then that one received a blow-now one and now another was on the top. Just then Reuben dealt the other a severe blow right above the left eye; blood poured from the wound; the vanquished boy broke out in an exclamation of pain, cried "Enough! enough!" and some of the bystanders, who had uninterferingly watched this struggle, now approached the combatants and forcibly separated them. Reuben's hands were still clenched, as if held in readiness to renew the attack. In the mean time the other boy was hurried off by the crowd, but not before he had given vent to his rage by cursing like a trooper-a habit to which the American youth is, hardly without any exception, strongly addicted. 
                  "Fear not, ragamuffin," he exclaimed, gnashing his teeth; "I'll remember you to the last day of my life." 
                  Reuben shrugged his shoulder, picked up his hat from the pavement, pulled it once more over his head, and, with hands in pocket, walked sulkily through the still remaining bystanders. 
                  We will not follow him at present, but once more return to the room which we have seen him leave in anger. There his mother was still seated at the table despondingly looking at the vacated chair beside her. O, how her poor heart ached, as she sat alone, away from her native home and the far-off, but still remembered, friends of her youth-sat there, old, forgotten and forsaken, in a distant land, among strangers, forcing down her scanty supper, while the long, long past, with its joys and sorrows-with its lights and shades-as like in a mirror, passed vividly through the avenues of her mind. It was a sad, sad retrospect. The tears came to her eyes, and now and then one rolled lazily down her wrinkled cheeks, and dropped upon the trembling hand which held the cup of coffee to her thin blue lips. She turned her eyes toward the hearth, and another big tear rolled down her cheeks. There, upon the bench, his back turned to his wife, his arms loosely hanging down, his head lowered to his breast, sat Mr. Armhold. The storm had subsided, the wrath was allayed, the passions had cooled down, and he was once more the weak, helpless old man. He was absorbed in himself, pervaded by a languishing, apathetic doziness, and he spoke not, heard not, saw not. He was a picture of morbid lassitude, evincing in every feature an exhaustion both of physical and mental strength. And this was Emil Armhold! 
                  The door opened-but this time gently-and in came a boy, upon whose back rested a bundle, the weight of which made him stoop forward and breathe heavily. At the first glance one would have taken him to be Reuben, for both in size and features he resembled him much. But a closer observation must soon have convinced one of the error. Though his lithe form was of the same mould, and his features of the same shape, yet the expression of the whole bore a wide contrast to that of the other. His ruddy lips curled not in pride and bitterness, his eyes flashed no fire, his youthful brow was not darkened by a frown. A gentle meekness hovered in every lineament of his face, which was as delicate as that of a female. From under his dark and long-fringed lashes peeped forth a pair of eyes-O, what eyes!-so black, full and deep, and yet so soft, overflowing and gentle, so appealing and so calm, so mute and yet so open, unfathomable as the ocean, attracting and reading hearts without ponetrating them. His hair was long, and black as the jetty wings of a raven, and as soft as eider-down. It was Edgar, the younger and twin brother of Reuben. He had just returned from his daily routine of peddling notions among the wealthier citizens. It was late-he had taken a larger circuit than usual-and he thought an apology was due his parents for his long absence. Consequently he hastened to dispose of his bundle, which was done by dragging it into the corner closest to the door, then approached his mother, cold and shivering as he was and told her the reason of his long stay. She listened to him patiently as he stood by her side, his stiff little hands resting in her own, then removed his cap and comforter, and pointing to the hearth, said: 
                  "Go to the fire, my son, and while you are warming your half-frozen limbs, I will set the table for you." 
                  "How has father been to-day?" he inquired, at the same time gazing at the bowed-down figure on the bench. "Has he again suffered rheumatic pain in his shoulders?" 
                  "Thank God it has almost left him," she replied, fervently. "He has made free use of his arm during the day, and this without much pain." 
                  Now Edgar left the presence of his mother and stepped across the room, and so light and noiseless were his steps, that they even did not awake his dozing father. He seated himself on a little footstool, which just happened to stand before the hearth, and stretched out his short arms to the fire to warm his almost frozen hands. Gradually he felt more comfortable, his face lost its redness, and exhibited once more a complexion translucently pure and fair. He was about returning to his mother, when, he thought, his father gave indications of being awake. Noiselessly he rose from his low seat, approached him, dropped upon his knees, and fondly raised his deep black eyes to those now looking down upon him. 
                  "Father," he whispered, in a voice so sweet and mournful, that it penetrated the soul of the old man and aroused his better nature,-"father, how have you passed the day? Are you better? Say, 'you are,' father. Mother thinks your health improved, and we are so glad." 
                  "I am some better, Edgar," replied the old man, his trembling hand stroking the soft, black hair of his son. 
                  "I have done well to-day, my father-sold fifteen dollars' worth of goods, and cleared something like two dollars. Wasn't that doing pretty well?" he said, a faint smile curling for a moment his beautifully chiseled lips. "Wasn't it?" and he took from his pocket a portmonaie, and commenced counting out the bills upon the old man's knee. "Here, take it, father, and put it in your pocket-book." 
                  "What shall I do with it? I don't want it, son," he replied; "give it to your mother-she has my pocket-book." 
                  Just then Mrs. Armhold approached her husband with a cup of hot coffee. The old man looked at her, and a big tear rolled down his lank cheeks. 
                  "Take this cup of coffee, Emil; I will hold it to your lips for you," she said, tenderly. 
                  Mr. Armhold raised his head, saw the red eyes of his wife, and his heart sank within him. He wanted to speak-to thank her-ask forgiveness-but his tongue would not obey him, and, in order to conceal his emotions tions, he lowered his head and commenced to drink his coffee. 
                  "Do you want another cup, Emil?" she said, helping him to a piece of toast she had prepared for him. 
                  "No, Rebecca, no," he replied, gently taking hold of her hand and pressing it affectionately in his own. "Here, wife, take this money, lay it aside, and give Edgar his supper.-Where is my pipe?" 
                  "Here, Emil;" and Mrs. Armhold reached him the pipe, and now the old man slowly puffed away and watched the gray smoke curling up. A spirit of peace had come over him, and his stern features gradually relaxed and assumed an expression of mildness. 
                  "Rebecca," he said, after a short pause, "keep the coffee hot for Reuben;" and she replaced the pot once more upon the fire, after which he continued, softening down still more, "you must go out to-morrow and get yourself a new dress-a warm dress." 
                  Mrs. Armhold approached him now, placing a pair of slippers under his feet. She had got Edgar to buy them for his father. He looked at her for a moment, took hold of her hand and pressed it in his own. 
                  "Rebecca," he said, in a hoarse voice, "I won't be so cross to you again." 
                  He sobbed. Big tears came to his eyes. She knelt down before him, removed his boots, and placed the slippers on his feet. 
                  "Are you more comfortable, Emil?" 
                  "Yes." 'Twas all he said. He lowered his head and wept aloud. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER V. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Gather the rose-buds while ye may, 
                              Old Time is still a-flying, 
                              And that same flower that bloomed to-day, 
                              To-morrow may be dying. 
                           
                         
                        HERRICK. 
                      
                   
                  IT was early on the following morning when Edgar, with a new supply of goods, left his parental home and started out once more on his routine. He visited several houses which had formerly patronized him, but up to noon he effected on this occasion only a few trifling sales. At some places his patrons were absent, at others they were at home but could not be suited, and at others again they were not in need of any things, and in this manner hour after hour had been spent. His spirits began to droop, but he murmured not. From his earliest infancy he had seen misery-was acquainted with it-thought himself born for it. And now as he traversed street after street, with that bundle heavily resting on his back, exposed to and encountering the fleers, gibes and ridicule of wicked and thoughtless boys, he would often raise his dark eyes toward that heaven whither his mother had taught him to look for support in his hour of affliction, and ask himself how a God could be all-merciful and see his children suffer so. 
                  We will not now explore his mind and read its innocent speculations, but patiently follow him from house to house, from street to street, until he arrived at last, tired and worn out, at Avondale, the suburbs of Cincinnati. It was the first time he had sought this splendid neighborhood, but the bad fortune that attended him during the day made it necessary to alter, to some extent, his regular routine. Having reached that vicinity of wealth, our youthful peddler halted for a moment, threw his bundle on the pavement, and with admiring eyes gazed at those splendid mansions of ease and luxury, inhabited by the merchant-princes of the metropolis. "How happy they must be?" he thought, and he raised his bundle from the ground, threw it on his back, and slowly proceeded on his way. He had now arrived in front of as stately a mansion as his eyes ever beheld. Here he could stop and try his fortune. Something in his heart told him to enter that house. Was it the voice of destiny? 
                  Edgar opened the lower gate, followed a side lane which led to the back part of the house, and knocked at the door of the servants' apartment. 
                  "Come in." 
                  Edgar stood in the presence of something like a half dozen female servants, some cooking, some washing dishes, and others talking. He had evidently made his way into the kitchen. Two little girls were also there. They were hardly ten years of age, richly attired, and chattering with some of the servants. Both were fair skinned and blue-eyed, but the hair of the one was blonde, while that of the other was red. The former seemed more retired-less forward in her manner-than the latter. There was something like pride in the way she held her head-a strange dignity in her behavior. This was Hannah, the daughter of the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Preston, the occupants of this elegant mansion. The other was her cousin Carrie who had come to spend the week with her, as her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Harrington whose residence adorned Clifton Avenue, were absent from the city. 
                  No sooner had Edgar entered the kitchen than Carrie ran toward the door and asked our young peddler, who had placed his bundle on the floor, what he wanted here, and whom he desired to see. As she raised these questions, her mischievous blue eyes laughed and danced in their sockets, and boldly wandered over our young hero, from head to foot-from top to toe. 
                  "Whom do you want to see?" she inquired in a clear, silvery voice, and her small, dimpled hands removed, in one wild sweep, the red curls that fell loosely over her ruddy face. 
                  "The mistress of the house," replied Edgar, modestly. "Is she at home?" 
                   
                  "Yes, sir; yes sir." 
                  "Would you oblige me by asking her whether she'd like to buy any thing of me?" 
                  Carrie still gazed at his pale, sad face. His voice was so sweet and pleasant, and he had spoken so politely, that she took quite an interest in him and began to like him. It was her nature to like any body-every body-whom she did not emphatically hate, and so far she had had no occasion to hate any one. She was not yet of the age to love or even to understand the precise feelings of that mighty passion, or to arouse it in others, but yet there was something inexpressibly attractive in her girlish form, undefined and undeveloped as its charms and graces still were, that gave promise of an early maturity, when the least circumstance might give birth to that feeling whose intensity only dies with the embers of the heart. She was not beautiful, even her features were not classic and regular, and yet, despite all this-despite her red hair, light eye-brows and full lips, no one would have pronounced her ugly. There was something in her figure which constantly attracted you toward it, and reminded you of woman, like a fresh bud about to burst open in full bloom. You imagined that you could see beauties which were as yet in the perspective. 
                  "What is your name?" she inquired, displaying a row of pearly teeth, that vied in whiteness with alabaster. 
                  "Edgar is my name," he said. 
                  "Well, Edgar, I will go and ask aunt," and she tripped lightly across the kitchen and for a moment stopped by the side of her cousin to say, 
                  "Hannah, come along with me." 
                  "No," she replied somewhat haughtily. 
                  "No?-why, cousin Hannah?" 
                  "Because I don't wish to go. You know mother don't want Jew-peddlers to come into our house, and I don't fancy them either." 
                  The latter sentence was uttered rather in an undertone, as she evidently intended it only for her cousin's ears. But Carrie, who was not blessed with too great a share of discretion, turned about face and blabbered, 
                  "Are you a Jew?" 
                  Edgar lifted his sad face at the little interrogatress, and replied in a voice so clear and melodious, that it seemed to rise from the throat of Philomel. 
                  "I am a Jew boy." 
                  "Cousin says, her 'ma don't want Jewpeddlers to come into her house." 
                  Edgar's cheeks turned pale. Hannah observed it as she furtively looked into his dreamy black eyes, and she was angry at Carry for having repeated her words. 
                  "I didn't know it," Edgar replied, lifting his bundle from the floor, "or I should not have come in." 
                  "Carrie," whispered Hannah in her cousin's ear, "tell him to stay and warm his feet." 
                  She saw that he was suffering from cold, but it was against her nature to speak to him herself, after what had passed. 
                  "Why, you don't need to go away just now," remarked Carrie, placing herself between the door and Edgar. "We are not going to eat you. Throw this heavy pack on the floor and sit down by the fire. Come, warm yourself." 
                  "Thank you, you are very kind. But I must not stay here, your aunt may come down and scold you for having allowed me to remain." 
                  "O, she won't care." 
                  "I am afraid she may." 
                  "Sit down and warm yourself," one of the servants said, "mistress won't be down, and if she should, she wouldn't say any thing." 
                  Edgar put his bundle in the corner of the kitchen, and then took a seat by the stove whither Carrie had followed him. She seated herself by his side, as if she had known him for years, and commenced asking him several questions about himself, which he answered with all candor and truthfulness. 
                  "I like you, Edgar," she said among other things, turning her restless blue orbs mischievously toward the pale face of our young peddler. "You have such pretty eyes and hair. How black they are! O, how I do like black eyes, and black hair!" 
                  It was the first time that Edgar had heard his appearance extolled. He became embarrassed, and his young fiery blood rose to his soft cheeks, and painted them crimson. Carrie who had not yet withdrawn her look from him, noticed this change which made him still more beautiful in her eyes than eyer. Now she moved up a little closer toward him-their elbows touched-bashfully lowered her head toward her breast, and allowed her fingers to play for some time with the strings of her little white apron. 
                  "Edgar," she said, softly, and without looking up from her apron, "red hair is so ugly. Don't you think so?" 
                  Edgar did think so, but was too polite to say it on this particular occasion. He felt very uneasy and wished he had never entered the house, for he would not tell a falsehood, and how could he tell the truth? There was nothing to do but to remain silent, and silent he remained. But Carrie was not quite satisfied, for after finding her question unheeded for some time, she reiterated it more distinctly, as he thought; and as she did so, she raised her head and their eyes met-hers: as blue and clear as heaven and open as the day itself-his: as deep as the unfathomable ocean and as black as the blackest night. Day and night are separated by golden morn or rosy eve. They saw each other reflected in the mirror of the former, and found each other lovely. Edgar's eyes still rested on the face of Carrie, and he was strangely fascinated. It was not her ruddy lips, her round cheeks, the soft expression of her eyes-it was part of all, or all blended into one, that made her look so beautiful to him. 
                  "You are a pretty little girl," he stammered, a blush stealing over his face. 
                  "Do you really think so?" she whispered in return, again busy with her apron-strings. 
                  "Yes." 
                  Carrie looked very cautiously around the kitchen-the servants were busy-their backs were turned toward her-"how fortunate!" she thought. 
                  "Why don't you brush those black curls over your forehead," she said aloud, jumping off her chair, and approaching our young hero, as if for the purpose of brushing away those straying curls, but instead-smack it went-she pressed a kiss upon his lips. 
                  Had Edgar been a girl for the first time listening to the advances of a lover, he could not have felt more embarrassed. From ear to ear he was a blushing flame. For a moment he knew not what to say or do, and when he was about to speak and look around, he found that Carrie had left him and tripped across the room, looking for her cousin. But Hannah could not be seen. She had stolen from the kitchen to her mother's chamber, after she had told Carrie to press Edgar to stay awhile and warm his feet. 
                  "Ma," she said, as she stood by the side of that stately lady, who reclined with book in hand, on a divan of the richest velvet, ma, a peddler is down stairs, in the kitchen-he wants to know whether he may come up and show you his stock of goods." 
                  "Daughter," she replied, in a calm voice, raising her eyes for a moment from her book, exposing a face whose every feature seemed to be cut in marble, so placid and so pale, and indicative of a lofty nature and dignity of character, which was already showing itself in that of her youthful offspring, "daughter, it seems to me you should know by this time that I do not fancy peddlers." 
                  "I know it, 'ma, but he is only a boy, and not like other peddlers-he is genteel and polite." 
                  "Daughter, you have heard what your mother said. I don't encourage lazy vagabonds." 
                  "Ma, he does not look like a vagabond-no, indeed. May I call him up? You know you said but yesterday that you were out of needles, and I'm sure he has some." 
                  "Is he a Jew, daughter?" 
                  Hannah dreaded to answer this question. Her mother was a lady of strong prejudices, the strongest of which was her abhorrence of Jews. 
                  "He is only a boy, 'ma," she replied, evasively. 
                  "Call him up." 
                  Hannah's face lighted up, and, hardly knowing why, she thanked her mother, and glided down stairs to the kitchen. Carrie had just been inquiring whither her cousin had gone, when the latter made her appearance and whispered into her ear, to tell the youthful peddler, who was already at the door and in the act of leaving, to walk up stairs. This just suited Carrie. She ran across the room, her red locks falling every way, and unceremoniously took hold of Edgar's arm. 
                  When he was ushered into the presence of the stately Mrs. Preston by her niece, he discovered Hannah in the opposite wing of the room, looking through the windowpanes. 
                  "You have needles for sale?" Mrs. Preston inquired, looking up from her novel. 
                  "Yes, ma'am," he replied in a low, sweet voice, drawing a little nearer. 
                  "Are they of good quality?" 
                  "I will show them to you, if you permit me." 
                  "I do not like to be cheated," she added, looking over the novel again. 
                  "I have no desire to cheat you," Edgar faltered. 
                  Once more the warm blood rushed to his face and made it crimson. Hannah had turned her eyes upon him as her mother put the last question, and she observed with pain the impression it had left upon him. Now she seated herself, picked up a book she had found lying on the window-sill close by, pretended to read in it, but, in fact, intended to conceal the furtive glances she now and then threw at our young peddler, in whom she took considerably more interest than she was inclined to acknowledge even to herself. 
                  "I don't know about that," continued Mrs. Preston, slowly raising herself to a sitting posture, "I don't know about that-you peddlers are great cheats." 
                  Again Edgar changed color, but this time the blood rushed back to his heart, leaving his cheeks pale as the moon hanging over the dark, green sea. He cast his eyes downward and remained silent. Just then Carrie, who had also observed our hero, closely approached our marble-featured lady on the divan, and naively accosted her. 
                  "Aunt, why don't you tell him to show us his goods? O, I should like to see what he has in that bundle." 
                  "I haven't the least objection," observed Mrs. Preston, and Edgar dragged his heavy bundle toward the divan, knelt down, opened it, and commenced displaying his merchandise. 
                  "Here are the needles, ma'am," he said, reaching out a small box; "please examine them." 
                  Mrs. Preston took hold of the box and began to examine its contents. 
                  "I don't think they are good needles." 
                  "I don't know, ma'am." 
                  "They look good, aunt," commented Carrie, furtively looking into Edgar's face. 
                   
                  "What do you know about needles?" laughingly rejoined her aunt. 
                  "A good deal. Why-don't I know how to sew?" 
                  "O, don't talk so much, Carrie. Sit down and be quiet. It doesn't look well in a little girl to be so forward." 
                  "Aunt, I am not forward," she replied, half offended, tossing her long red curls over her shoulders, and seating herself on the divan by the side of her aunt. 
                  The needles were bought, other articles were examined, admired, and in less than thirty minutes Mrs. Preston's bill amounted to over thirty dollars. "This will do,' she said, as she took the goods she had purchased, and carried them into the adjoining room. 
                  Now Carrie jumped from her seat, and knelt down by the side of Edgar, whose spirits had considerably risen during the last few minutes, and raised her mischievous blue eyes toward his placid face. 
                  "You make a great deal of money-don't you?" she asked him, carelessly, as she watched him arrange his goods, which were scattered about the floor. 
                  "Not very much." 
                  "How much?" she persisted. 
                  "Some days I earn as high as one dollar, and some days not so much." 
                  "You must have much money?" 
                  "I have none at all." 
                  "Did you spend it all!" 
                  "No; I gave it to my father." 
                  Carrie drooped her head upon her bosom, and remained silent for a moment. 
                  "What does your father do with your money?" she inquired, at length, in a lower key. 
                  "He gives it to my mother." 
                  "Your mother?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  Another pause-it lasted but a second. 
                  "And does your father peddle, too?" 
                  "Not now." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because he is too old and sick," he faltered, and a bright tear started to his eyes. Hannah, though a quiet spectatress, had heard the whole colloquy. She had laid the book back upon the sill, and was now gazing into the sad eyes of our young hero. 
                  "Is your father poor-very poor?" continued Carrie. 
                  "Yes," fell mournfully from his thin, pale lips. 
                  "I love you, Edgar," she whispered in his ear, and pressed a kiss upon his smooth white brow. 
                  "Did Hannah see this? No. She was no longer in the room. She had heard the handsome peddler speak of poverty, her heart pitied him, and she had sought her mother's presence. 
                  "'Ma," she said, after she had found her, "please give me my pocket-book." 
                  "Here it is, daughter, but don't spend your money foolishly." 
                  "No, 'ma." 
                  She was once more by the window, pretending to look through it, and Edgar was still arranging his goods, with Carrie kneeling by his side. 
                  "O, what a handsome pair of gloves those are!" the latter exclaimed, holding up a pair of dove-colored kids. "If I were a grown young lady now, I would have those gloves or none at all. Hannah, O, Hannah! why don't you come here and look at all these nice things? I know the reason. You don't love the Jews." 
                  Hannah did not love the Jews, but for once in her life, she disliked to have the fact alluded to. 
                  "You speak too much, Carrie," she said, quite offended. A moment after, she left the room. Now Mrs. Preston made her appearance, paid her bill, and instructed her niece to conduct the boy down stairs. 
                  "You haven't asked me for my name yet-have you?" she said, after the door was closed behind them. "My name is Carrie-Carrie Harrington. The other little girl is my cousin Hannah. She is so proud, but they say she is handsome. Do you think her pretty?" 
                  "Your cousin is a very pretty girl." 
                  "Edgar." 
                  "Miss Carrie." 
                  "Didn't you say that I was pretty, too?" 
                  "I did." 
                  "Then kiss me." 
                  Edgar blushed from ear to ear. He had seen many bold girls, but none as bold as this little, laughing witch. He walked on as if he had not heard her. 
                  "Edgar." 
                  "Carrie." 
                  "You don't think me pretty," she continued, taking hold of his hand and pressing it in her own. "You think me ugly, else you would kiss me." 
                  "I mustn't kiss you, Carrie. It is wrong, and your aunt would be angry were she to see it." 
                  "But she won't see it, Edgar," she lisped, raising her soft, roguish eyes to his face, which was at the same time bending down on her. "Come, and kiss me-won't you, Edgar?" 
                  "It is wrong, Carrie," he pleaded. 
                  "No, it isn't;" and she wouldn't suffer him to go further. The bundle gradually glided to the floor, and soon after Edgar was reclining on it, with Carrie sitting on one of his knees, fondly playing with his black curls, and winsomely looking into his dreamy eyes. 
                  "You don't love me, Edgar." 
                  "Yes I do, Carrie." 
                  "Why don't you kiss me, then?" 
                  "Because it is wrong, Carrie." 
                  "It is because you think me ugly;" and 
                      
                        "FATHER! I WILL NOT CRY FOR BREAD AGAIN." 
                     
                     
                      her full, blue eyes swam in tears. "Every body says I am ugly." 
                  Edgar pitied the weeping girl-she seemed so unhappy to be thought ugly-and he pressed a kiss on her ruddy lips. "Now, are you satisfied?" he said, trying to rise, but Carrie gently wound her arm around his neck, and placed her cheek against his own. 
                  "Another kiss, Edgar," she lisped, "another kiss." 
                  "Rise, Carrie, and let me go." 
                  "O, stay a while longer. Aunt won't see us." 
                  "It is very wrong, Carrie." 
                  "Is it so wrong to love one another?" 
                  "No, but-" 
                  "You fear aunt," she added, looking fondly into his face. 
                  "Let me go, Carrie." 
                  "I love black eyes and black hair. They are so beautiful. Kiss me again-will you, Edgar? O, yes, you will." 
                  Another kiss, and another kiss, and another kiss, and still the girl of ten sat on the lap of the boy of thirteen, not dreaming of the world of misery this childish indiscretion might entail upon herself. Had she known and understood, at her early age, the sorrow such youthful indiscretion brings, how differently would she have acted! Alas! where was the mother to guard her from the first misstep? 
                  "I must go, Carrie," he lisped in her ears, trying to remove her arm from around his neck. 
                  "A good-bye kiss first-one-two-three-another-only another-won't you? Now." 
                  They went down to the kitchen. There was Hannah, standing in a corner by the side of a servant, whispering in her ear: "He is coming-speak to him." 
                  "Miss Hannah," commenced the servant to Edgar, "wants one of your handkerchiefs. You had better open your bundle again, and show them to my young mistress." 
                  It took our young hero but a few minutes to spread out his goods upon the kitchen floor. Carrie was again by his side, chattering like a magpie. Hannah, too, had come forth from her retreat, and was kneeling there. She was quite taciturn, but now and then she would modestly raise her eyes and scan Edgar's face. He showed her all his goods, without urging her to buy-used such pretty language, and in a voice so sweet and musical, that she forgot for a moment that she was listening to a Jew peddler. He also showed her some handkerchiefs, one of which he particularly fancied, and Hannah purchased it-she would have no other. She handed him a bill; he rose to make the change, and Carrie was still chattering away, now to this one and now to that one, when her cousin, having waited for an opportunity to do so, unobserved threw something among the goods, which lay loosely in the bundle, and then rose to receive her change. 
                  It was late that evening when Edgar entered the room of his parents. As usual, he found his father, with pipe in mouth, seated on a wooden bench by the hearth, and his mother busy preparing a frugal supper for her husband and children. He approached the former, inquired after his health, handed to him the proceeds of his day's sales, and informed him, in a gleeful voice, of the good fortune that had attended him in Avondale. Mr. Armhold was in a good humor. Edgar saw it, and he felt doubly happy. Knowing that it would please his old father, he carried his bundle before the hearth, unpacked it, showed him of which particular goods he had made sales, how much he had got for one article and how much for another. While thus occupied, his eyes lighted upon something glittering among the goods. He turned as pale as ashes. It was a large gold coin. He had seen the very same in the hands of little Hannah who had bought of him the handkerchief. 
                  "Father," he said, "I must go back to Avondale. This gold coin belongs not to me. I have seen one like it in the hands of a little girl; she dropped it, undoubtedly, in my bundle. She will miss it, and suspect me of having stolen it." 
                  Without waiting for a reply, he removed his goods to one side, picked up his hat, and ran toward the door. He had no time to take hold of the knob. Some one from without had already turned it, and a moment after the door flew wide open, and Reuben staggered into the room. 
                  "Brother!" exclaimed Edgar, quite horrified at the new-comer's wild appearance. 
                  "Is that you, Edgar? Get out of my way!" he cried, at the top of his voice, and fell headlong on the floor. 
                  Reuben was intoxicated-drunk. It was the first time that he had come home in such a miserable plight. Will it be the last time, or is it merely the first stepping-stone to ultimate ruin and degradation? 
                  Let us not anticipate events. 
                  Edgar understood the condition of his brother. Wiping a tear from his own eye, he helped, but not without some difficulty, Reuben to his feet, and, with the assistance of his weeping mother, eventually succeeded in dragging him upon the bed. There he left him in charge of his unhappy parents, while he hurried away to Avondale. 
                  A full half hour later, the boy stood in front of the side-gate of Mr. Preston's dwelling. A large, black dog, who was lying at the kitchen door, and had observed his approach, commenced barking furiously. Edgar was at a loss how to proceed. He feared to enter the gate, and also disliked to turn back, with his mission unaccomplished. He picked up a stone and threw it at the dog, with the intention of driving him away, which only had the effect of making him still more furious, and louder in barking. Just then the door was opened, and a shrill voice silenced the dog. 
                  Edgar then entered by the gate and went back to the kitchen. There were the same servants he had seen a few hours ago. Hannah was also down stairs; but no sooner had he entered the room, than she placed herself behind one of the girls, so he should not be able to see her. But his eyes had caught her delicate little form, and, consequently, hiding was useless. He approached her, with hat in hand, and said: 
                  "I found this gold coin among my goods; it is the same I saw in your hand. Let me return it to you." 
                  "Thank you," she whispered, and held out her little hand to receive the coin. "Do you want it?" she added, timidly, as if afraid to offend, after a short pause. 
                  "Thank you-no." 
                  "Are you not a poor boy?" 
                  "Yes; but I don't beg," he replied, and left the room. When he was gone Hannah raised her little white apron to her face and wept, until the loud voice of her cousin Lionel startled her, when she ran to the door, and found him and Edgar, lying on the ground, beating each other. 
                  Lionel was the boy whom Reuben had whipped on the preceding evening.

                        SHERIDAN ON FEMALE GAMESTERS. 
                      
                   
                  AFTER the lapse of six years from the event described in the last chapter, we find ourselves once more in Avondale, at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Preston. 
                  It was on a splendid autumn evening-an evening destined to witness a social gathering at this mansion, in celebration of Hannah Preston's birthday, this being its sixteenth anniversary; and a considerable stir could be observed among the servants, and even the "occupants proper" gave indications of that restlessness generally preceding such an occasion. A good many guests were expected. Mrs. Preston had sent cards of invitation to a number of young ladies-mostly acquaintances of the family-and her husband had been no less chary in inviting a number of gentlemen, including his principal clerks and bookkeepers, which latter step, however, had not been altogether approved by his better-half. 
                  We ascend two flights of stairs, pass through a winding passage of Parian marble, which is lighted up at regular intervals by lamps suspended from the arched ceiling, and enter a handsomely furnished room, through the windows of which a full view of the garden in the rear of the house can be had. 
                  In this room were two young ladies, keeping up a lively chat between each other while preparing and decorating themselves for the festivities. Both were beautiful, and of that age when girlhood and womanhood blend their respective charms, and open the heart for the reception of the holiest feelings-the sweetest sensations-human nature can conceive. 
                  One of these young ladies was Hannah Preston, in whose honor this soiree was to be given; the other her cousin, Carrie Harrington. In the six years we have not seen them, as may be expected, they had wonderfully changed. They were no longer the little girls of ten summers, with short frocks and white pantalets; no, in sooth, they were now full-grown young ladies, for at sixteen, females in this country suppose to have finished their education, and, to use the general phrase, are ready to "set out." 
                  Hannah was just braiding her hair, and sitting before a small toilet table, looking into a bright mirror, which reflected her lovely face. On the opposite side of the room stood her cousin Carrie, examining a basket of flowers, from which she selected a full-blown white dahlia, and placed it in her hair. 
                  "Hannah," she said, in a gleeful tone, lightly tripping behind her cousin's seat to view herself in the mirror, "how do you like this new improvement-this white dahlia in my red hair? I think it suits its complexion-don't you think so?" 
                  "Yes, yes, Carrie; but, now, I pray you, let me for a moment attend to my own toilet," she replied testily, without looking from the glass. "Sit down until I have arranged my stubborn hair; will you?" 
                  "No, I shan't move a step," persisted the other, laughing, "until you have looked at me, and given me your candid opinion as to my appearance. Now, tell me honestly, or I won't give you a moment's rest." 
                  "You have asked this question more than fifty times in twenty minutes." 
                  "How do I look? Answer me, or-or-" 
                  "Well, for the thousandth time-you look beautiful," replied Hannah. 
                  "Beautiful!" exclaimed Carrie, laughing, once more looking into the glass-"beautiful! my red hair! What! did I say 'red?"-auburn! most assuredly it is auburn. Won't it challenge considerable admiration? Won't it though?" and she commenced rocking the chair occupied by her cousin. 
                  "Can't you let me rest for a single moment?" replied Hannah, somewhat impatiently. 
                  "No, it is an utter impossibility." 
                  "One would suppose so, judging by your conduct this evening." 
                  "Am I beautiful?" Carrie said, with a mock dignity. "Answer me." 
                   
                  "I told you, yes." 
                  "Are you serious?" 
                  "Quite serious." 
                  "Well, I must confess that I have seen girls who looked worse than I, and who still had some pretensions to beauty," said Carrie, coquettishly nodding her head, as she left her cousin's chair, and began to pace slowly up and down the room, her large, blue eyes resting upon herself. "O, how I should like to catch a beau to-night!" she continued, having satisfactorily viewed herself. "Well, if I don't, it won't be my fault." 
                  "O, Carrie, you ought to blush to speak in this manner. A girl of your age to speak of a beau! it is preposterous!" 
                  "My age! Am I not sixteen?" 
                  "O, don't be silly." 
                  "Well, I won't; I will be serious." 
                  "Do, for once." 
                  "Yes, for once. Now, Hannah-" and here Carrie seated herself upon a sofa-"I want you to be candid with me. You know, we are cousins, and may speak freely with each other. Don't you love some young man?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Don't you wish you could love some one?" 
                  "I don't know. I have never thought about it," Hannah said, quite innocently. "Why do you ask this question?" 
                  "Because I have always wished to love some one." 
                  "Carrie, you are really foolish." 
                  "Perhaps so, perhaps so," and she left her seat, and began to walk up and down the room. 
                  "Now, my toilet is completed," said Hannah, also rising from her seat, and approaching her cousin. "How do you like my appearance?" 
                  "Hannah, you look like an angel." 
                  And she did look like an angel, if ever a mortal being resembled one. Imagine you behold a girl of only sixteen summers, tall and gracefully grown and faultlessly shaped. A face that would have graced a Diana; a neck that might have belonged to a Juno; a small, straight nose; thin, red lips; rounded chin; white, pearly teeth; beautifully arched brow, and hair in color resembling the burnished gold; upon her oval cheeks the pale red of the rose; in her large eyes the soft blue of the sky. Imagine all this, and you will still have a poor likeness of this beauty, as she stood before Carrie, her head proudly erect, bringing to view a white neck, which was encircled with a chain of pearl beads. Her attire was plain and simple. A robe of white mull, without the least ornament, enveloped her slender figure, and a white flower adorned her head. 
                  But if Hannah was beautiful, her cousin was charming. Carrie Harrington was not quite so tall as her cousin, but her figure was as faultless and far more developed. She was also attired in white, and her dress being low-necked and short-sleeved, exposed to considerable advantage the round contour of her milk-white shoulders and round arms. Her eyes were full, soft and large, and of that peculiar blue which seems constantly to melt away and liquefy. Her blood-red lips were full and thick, unmistakably expressing a natural propensity for sensual enjoyments. Her gait was not as dignified as Hannah's, but more bold and fearless. Her voice was rich and musical, partaking more of laughter than of song, varying with every thought and changing with every feeling. 
                  "Hannah, you look like an angel," she repeated, with admiration gazing upon her cousin. "I have never seen you look so well at any time. This white dahlia becomes you exceedingly; don't you think the dahlia becomes me also?" 
                  "No other color, than the one you have chosen, would suit your complexion better." 
                  "I am not so very ugly, though I have rusty red hair," Carrie said, and took hold of her cousin's arm, leading her through the room.-"Am I, Hannah?" 
                  "How many times must I tell you yet, that you are truly handsome?" 
                  "I should die for grief, were I right ugly," said Carrie, with a serious mien. 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because no man would suffer me to love him then." 
                  "I don't understand you, Carrie." 
                  "Hannah, I don't understand myself; but this much I know and feel, that were I to love a gentleman who would be cold to my affections, I should go mad." 
                  As she said this a bright tear shone in her eyes, and her bosom heaved with strong emotions. 
                  Now the two cousins separated, and seated themselves at some little distance from each other. 
                  "Hannah, have your parents invited many guests?" inquired Carrie, after the lapse of a few minutes. 
                  "I don't know, indeed; but I fear father was too liberal with his invitations." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "I have heard him say that he invited also his principal clerks to attend. It did not please mother, and it does not exactly please me." 
                  "I hope he has not invited his new bookkeeper, for brother Lionel would most certainly get into a quarrel with him." 
                  "Why, Carrie?" 
                  "Because Lionel, whom the least thing can put out of humor, despises him, or, to use his own wicked expression, hates him." 
                  "Father thinks a great deal of this new book-keeper, though, I must confess to you, I should by no means regret his absence to night." 
                  "Why? Is he old and ugly? I hope he is not old." 
                  "I don't know whether he is the one, the other, or both; I only know he is a Jew, and I have a natural antipathy toward Jews. I never did like to come in contact with them. I hope he will not show himself." 
                  Hannah rose from her seat, approached the mirror and gazed into it, removed a stray curl from her temple, then, turning 'round, said: 
                  "It is time for us to repair to the drawing room, Carrie. Come, we will go down together." 
                  "I am ready." 
                  Carrie rose from the divan upon which she had been reclining, and approached Hannah. The two cousins stood face to face, and, as they looked at each other, smiled. 
                  "We'll not be the least attractive of the ladies-will we?" remarked Hannah, still gazing with admiration at the charming contour of her handsome cousin. 
                  "Hannah!" said the latter, with a seriousness quite uncommon to her, "I have a strange presentiment." 
                  "And what is it?" laughed Hannah. 
                  "Nothing more nor less than we shall fall in love to-night." 
                  "Not I, my dear," said Hannah, proudly curling her thin, red lips, and shaking her head-"no, not I, in sooth. But tell me, why do you call this a presentiment? You, who have been wishing for such an occurrence, I don't know for how long, to call it a presentiment, as if it were something to be dreaded! O, Carrie! Carrie! what an enigma you are!" and a silvery laugh broke through her ivory teeth. 
                  "Don't laugh, Hannah; I called it a presentiment, for it caused me to become sad." 
                  "Why, Carrie, I should forswear even to think of love were it to make me sad." 
                  "Hannah." 
                  "Carrie." 
                  'Our tastes and predilections have varied very little from our infancy to the present hour. Were you and I to fall in love with the same person to-night, which, you will admit, is a possibility if not a probability, I should hate to deprive you of him, and be equally as little inclined to part with him myself. Hannah, it is this thought that makes me sad." 
                  "If nothing else disturbs your mind," replied the other, pressing a warm kiss upon her cousin's cherry lips, "you may rest at ease and smile once more, for I am determined not to fall in love, or, if I should, at least not with the person upon whom you, perchance, might throw your first affections." 
                  Carrie stood there, absorbed in her own thoughts. 
                  "Promise me one thing, Hannah," she said, at length. 
                  "Two things, if you like," replied the other, smiling. 
                  "Should it turn out as I have said, let us, I pray you, be honest and magnanimous in our rivalry, and in our love as well as in the jealousy of our sex still remember the ties of friendship." 
                  "I promise you all this and more, my cousin," said Hannah, proudly curling her lips. "Could he who wins my love but think of another, I would discard him, and tear his image from my heart as if it were that of a venomous viper." 
                  Her eyes glistened and her cheeks turned pale. Carrie observed it, read her cousin's mind and-breathed easier. 
                  "God bless you, my Hannah," she said, affectionately, and her luscious orbs grew soft and mellow as if they were about to melt away. "God bless you, for you have made me happy. You have promised and I believe you. My charms fade away like pale sdadows when compared with yours, and therefore you could with ease supplant me in a lover's heart, if you would, and I should die, Hannah-die." 
                  She sank into her cousin's arms and wept. 
                  "Carrie, dry your tears and be yourself." 
                  "I will, Hannah, let us go down now." 
                  Arm in arm they left the room. 
                  There was, at the time the incidents of this story occurred a so-called "private boarding house" on Sixth street. Its proprietor, or more properly speaking-its lessee, was a man of some enterprise, and endeavored to make as much profit out of his business as possible. He knew that people drank as well as ate, hence he had attached a bar-room to his establishment, where all kinds of spirituous liquors were kept for the accommodations of his boarders and such of their friends as they might choose to introduce. This arrangement had earned him the gratitude of his several customers, who, on rainy evenings, would now gather in this room, smoke their cigars, play a social game of whist, and drink their "friends'" health. By and by the number of boarders had increased, so that the bar-room became too small to be sufficiently comfortable to all. Something had to be done. A new idea crossed the mind of the lessee. He would appropriate two or three rooms, on the second floor, to the use of his most particular friends, where they might spend their evenings to themselves. It was a capital thought. For among his boarders were men of unquestionable respectability, who loved to play games of hazard, but as they stood high in the opinion of society and was looked upon as the very embodiment of honor and morality, they could not afford to risk a public exposure. 
                  "These rooms are for you," said the lessee' one day to a number of gentlemen whom he had conducted into these apartments. "You will find the dice in the drawers of the small tables. If you should want me, all you have to do is to pull you string against the wall." 
                  From that time forth these gentlemen had been meeting there regularly every evening, frequently introducing strangers, who, to the astonishment of the uninitated, were sometimes not seen to depart before morning. This was the more astonishing as some of them were known to be men of families. 
                  It was the same evening, and about the same time when Hannah Preston and Carrie Harrington were leaving their chamber for the purpose of descending to the drawing-room, that a young gentleman entered the bar-room of our lessee-Mr. Bragg-where quite a crowd of smokers, drinkers, and gamblers was already assembled. 
                  The new-comer was a handsome youth of something like nineteen summers. His frame was lithe and slender, indicating more activity than strength. He was of a very fair skin; had large black eyes and long black hair; his cheeks were rosy as those of a blushing girl, and his teeth were as white as snow. An elegant suit of gray made up his attire, and gracefully fitted his body. On his head he wore a low hat of black fur, which was carelessly shoved back, exposing a nicely developed forehead, which, however, was somewhat clouded on this occasion. After looking through the crowd for some moments, without espying the object of his search, he drew a chair toward the stove, called for a cigar, then seated himself, his face toward the door fronting the street. 
                  A moment later some one tapped him familiarly on the shoulder. Looking around, he observed by his side a tall and unshapely young man, with a sallow face, whose sinister, light gray eyes, longhooked nose, and yellow teeth, by no means improved its appearance. 
                  "Let's step aside," he said. 
                  "No one will overhear us. Draw a chair here," said the other, shoving his hat still further back from his brow. 
                  "Have you the money?" commenced the hook-nosed stranger, after seating himself. 
                  "No; I can't pay you this evening." 
                  "You promised to settle with me to-night, did you not?" 
                  "I know it-I know it. But the cards have run against me for some time, and now I am flat broke. Play what I would, I lost. I never saw or heard of such a streak of ill-luck. For nearly a month there hasn't been a night but what I've quitted loser. It's enough to drive one mad!" 
                  He bit his lips and remained silent for a few minutes, evidently reflecting over his unpleasant position. 
                  "You must wait until I can raise the money," he continued. "There's no use of speaking any thing further upon this matter." 
                  "Borrow it." 
                  "I have borrowed now more than I can pay." 
                  "What's that to me?" said the gray-eyed stranger, exhibiting considerable dissatisfaction. "What's that to me? Do you think that I can put off my creditors in that manner? I tell you, I need my money this very night. I have made arrangements on the strength of your promise: hence I am determined to see you fulfill that promise." 
                  "But if it be out of my power to do so?" remarked the other, coolly, compressing his lips. "I have told you that I have borrowed more than I can pay." 
                  "And I have told you that I must have my money this very night," said the other, in a louder tone. 
                  "What can you do if I don't choose to be frightened by your loud talking?" 
                  "Will you pay me?" 
                  "No!" 
                  "I hardly think your employer knows to what kind of a gentleman he has intrusted his business," said the gray-eyed stranger, laconically. "Perhaps he would thank me for the information I have the power to impart to him." 
                  His listener turned as white as snow, and a perceptible tremor shook his frame. Of all threats this was the only one which he feared. He cast his black eyes to the ground for several moments, then said: 
                  "Give me an hour's time, and you shall have your money." 
                  "One hour? Good." 
                  The two young gentlemen then separated, one to join his comrades up stairs-the other to get the money. 
                  Let us see how the latter managed to obtain it. 
                  After he had left the bar-room, and was on the street, he pulled his hat over his forehead to conceal his face, buttoned up his coat to the chin, placed his hands in his pockets, and then turned his hasty steps up Walnut to Fourth, down Fourth to Vine, and down Vine to Third street. Here he met several acquaintances; but they did not seem to recognize him. Soon he was in front of a large, stone building. It was the establishment of his employer. He looked up and down the street-no one was observing him. How fortunate! He drew a brass key from his coat-pocket, and inserted it in the lock. 
                  A moment later he stood in the counting-room-in front of a massive iron safe. His face was as white as a sheet of linen. He was about to commit a crime from which his nature revolted. He hesitated for some time. The good was struggling with the bad; but the latter conquered. The emergency was great, and help was in his reach. He was resolved. He still looked at that black, iron safe. He knew it to contain large sums of money-it was his employer's-but what of that? He drew a little nearer, and kneeled down. Just then, he thought, he heard a light footfall in the other wing of the house. He started within himself-a falling leaf can frighten a criminal-and slunk toward the door. He listened-all was as silent as the grave-his ear must have deceived him. Noiselessly he stole back, inserted the key in the safe; the heavy door heavily creaked on its hinges; and nothing save Conscience stood between the thief and his spoil. He thought of the emergency-his hands were on the money-on the money of his employer. Again he believed he heard a footfall. Could he again be mistaken? He began to tremble. His heart palpitated wildly. Fear took possession of his soul. He would not delay his business one minute longer. Looking into the deep darkness, he breathed a little easier. The money was purloined, the safe was locked; and, fifteen minutes later, the door of the bar-room of Mr. Bragg opened, and our young gentleman with black hair and black eyes entered, and was conducted to his comrades up stairs. He went into one of the private rooms spoken of in the beginning of this chapter. There he found several tables occupied by card-players. At the furthest end of the room sat his gray-eyed creditor, who, as soon as he became aware of the presence of the other, excused himself to his companions, rose from the table, and said: 
                  "You have been punctual." 
                  "Yes-Two hundred dollars." 
                  "I am glad you have brought it, for I have lost heavily since I sat down." 
                  "Have you? I will join the party: perhaps your luck will change." 
                  Five minutes later they were snugly seated at the table, engaged in playing a five-handed game of draw. 
                  Our black-haired youth bet high and indiscreetly, and consequently lost. When he first sat down, he resolved to win as much money as he had purloined from his employer's safe, which sum, to his credit be it said, it was his intention to restore that very night. The indications, however, were that he should leave the table a heavy loser. He saw the drift of the game-the dwindling down of his money-and he became excited so that he hardly displayed the least judgment in his bets. When ten o'clock struck, he hadn't a dollar left. 
                  Winners at games of hazard are always moral. The comrades of this youth were no exception to the rule. The clock had struck ten. They had his money, and, as a matter of course, moral principle required that they should repair to their respective homes, and-they made ready to go home. 
                  The unfortunate young man arose with the balance, and silently followed them down stairs. His cheeks were as white as ashes, his lips as blue as prunes. 
                  On the morning his crime would be discovered. 
                  He compressed his lips, shoved his hat back from his temples, heaved a long sigh, joined his companions at the bar, drank their health, then left for home. 
                  Across the canal. 
                  Mrs. Armhold was seated by the window of the same room in which we saw her six years ago. The knitting was in her hand; but her eyes were not on the knitting. Poor Mrs. Armhold had grown blind. The light of day no longer gladdened her soul. She was never heard to complain. It was His will that she should suffer, and she bowed submissively to it. 
                  By her side kneeled a dark-eyed girl of seven summers. She was a clear brunette, with beautiful, glossy hair, and handsome features. Her face was peculiarly Jewish. 
                  Some three years ago-it was on a cold wintry evening-a gentleman, apparently not five-and-twenty, had entered the abode of Emil Armhold, leading a little swarthylooking girl by the hand. 
                  The stranger saluted both Mr. and Mrs. Armhold, then continued: 
                  "I have a request to make of you, good people." 
                  He approached the hearth, without raising his face from the ground. 
                  "What can we do for you?" said Mr. Armhold. 
                  "Give this little girl-she is a posthumous child; her poor mother died in giving birth to her-a home in this dwelling. Let your wife be a mother to her and thereby earn the blessings of Heaven. I am called to a distant country, and must leave this very night." 
                  "We are poor people-" Mr. Armhold began. 
                  "I know who you are: your condition in life is no secret to me. Let this suffice for the present. Here is a small sum of money, which, I hope, will be sufficient, however, to defray all the expenses that you may incur during my absence. Take it, sir; let your wife be a mother to this child, and I shall go upon my journey with a gladdened heart." 
                  "What is your name?" inquired Mrs. Armhold of the little girl. 
                  "Ruth Arnold." 
                  "Ruth, would you like to remain with us?" 
                  The little girl looked into the eyes of the stranger, then at the old lady who had questioned her, and whispered, "Yes." 
                  "And will you be good?" 
                  "Yes;" and her black eyes ran over with tears. 
                  "Come into my arms, and let me kiss you." 
                  "Ruth," said the grave stranger, "you must obey your new mother; and when I return in the spring, I hope to have no further occasion to leave you again." 
                  After some few other arrangements, the gentleman left the house. It was the last seen or heard of him up to this day. 
                  Back to our story. 
                   
                  "Mother," whispered the little girl, at the same time directing her eyes toward a bed on which Mr. Armhold-or rather what was left of him, for he had grown skeleton-like-lay in a deep slumber, "father sleeps long this evening. Shall I rouse him, mother, and give him his medicine?" 
                  "No, my daughter; let him rest. Sleep is nature's restorative, and as efficacious a remedy as the most skillful physician can recommend. Do not disturb him, Ruth." 
                  "No, mother." 
                  Mr. Armhold had been a bedridden invalid for nearly four years. His poor wife-the blind and weak Rebecca-thought little of herself and her own infirmity. Night after night she had watched at her husband's bedside, banishing sleep from her lightless eyes, which were prayerfully bent toward that beautiful heaven she could no longer see, paying him the closest attention. She was his nurse, and combined with the duties of the wife those of the mother. Sweet, gentle, and consoling were her words, and often she would smile-it was the smile of a chastened spirit-and with words of hope and love soothe the troubled spirit of her peevish husband. 
                  What was it that gave strength to poor Rebecca-strength to bear up under her many afflictions? What was it that made her bear her suffering without a single murmur? 
                  Reader! it was the chastity of her soul-the purity of her thoughts. 
                  As she gradually neared the goal of her existence-as she felt her strength declining-as she wrote in tears of anguish the last chapters of her dreary life-as she saw the portals of heaven open to receive her soul-a strange calm came soothingly over her heart, and breathed into it a spirit of resignation to the sorrows and deprivations of her earthly home. But yet-how she yearned for that time when death would liberate her spirit! 
                  Again she would see her mother-again she would see her father. O, how this thought took possession of her soul, and brought tears of joy to her sightless eyes! It was so long-so very long-since she had seen them-O, her mother, her father!-and now she was soon to meet them again. She had so much to tell them of what she had suffered, and they would listen to her, and wipe away her tears. She would be their child again-their good little Rebecca-and they her own father and mother. 
                  Was it a wonder that she longed for death? 
                  "Ruth," she said, sadly, as she now sat there, her sightless eyes mechanically bent down upon her knitting, which they could no longer see, "Ruth, and is my Edgar still pale in the face? Tell me, daughter." 
                  "Mother, I think he is growing paler every day." 
                  "And thinner, daughter?" 
                  "Yes, mother, but it makes him look the more handsome." 
                  "Does it?" asked the mother, and tears flowed down the wrinkles of her cheeks. 
                  "Do not weep, mother," said the little girl, rising from her seat, and kissing the tears from those sunken cheeks. "Do not weep, mother, for it makes me sad, and I know, were Edgar to see it, it would also make him sad." 
                  "I shall weep no more, daughter.-And he is growing paler-thinner-you say?" 
                  "He is, mother; but I pray you do not repeat it to Edgar, for he begged me to conceal this fact from you." 
                  "Did he?" and poor Rebecca wept again; but Ruth saw not the tears; for they fell inside-upon her heart. 
                  Just then the door flew wide open, and Reuben, harum-scarum-like, entered the room, and approached his mother with his hat falling back upon his head, and his eyes wildly flashing fire. 
                  "Mother, I am about to leave you this night," he said, evidently excited and seeming to be somewhat under the influence of strong drink. "Yes, I am about to leave you for some time. Should I never see you again forgive me." 
                  "Do I understand you, my son?" she said, fearing the very worst, her lips and cheeks turning as pale as death. 
                  Before Reuben had time to answer, a gentleman who had stolen into the room, unperceived, grasped him by the collar, saying: 
                  "You are my prisoner." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              I love thee, and I feel 
                              That in the fountain of my heart a seal 
                              Is set, to keep its waters pure and bright 
                              For thee. 
                           
                         
                        SHELLEY. 
                      
                   
                  WHEN Hannah and Carrie entered the drawing-room, they discovered that but few of the guests had as yet made their appearance. Those who had arrived were entertained by Mr. Newton Preston-brother of Hannah, who was by two years her senior-and by Lionel Harrington, brother of Carrie. 
                  The two girls approached the small party, principally consisting of young ladies and gentlemen with whom they were intimately acquainted, and exchanged the customary salutations. 
                  "Cousin Hannah," commenced Lionel Harrington-a handsome, dashing, harum-scarum fellow-"we have just been discussing the propriety of sending to you a deputation for the purpose of saluting and congratulating you in the name of your honorable guests, but your untimely entrance frustrated our design and the excellent plan we had devised-a plan which has cost us something like an hour's debate before it was adopted." 
                  "I deeply regret," replied Hannah, slightly changing color-she always blushed whenever she knew herself the principal subject of discussion-"that my ignorance of your highly flattering intentions has caused me to be deprived of an enjoyment I had so little a right to anticipate. Allow me to thank you for the honor intended." 
                  "And I am really mortified," added Carrie, a coquettish smile curling her ruddy lips, "that your deputation-I hope it consisted of two handsome cavaliers-should have been deprived of the exquisite pleasure of conducting us, arm in arm, into your midst;" and here her laughter rang through the whole drawing-room, which was now filling up with guests, whom Mrs. Preston received at the door. 
                  "The deputation consisted merely of a couple of cooks," added her cousin Newton, who was seated by her side, and loved to tease her. 
                  "Thank you-thank you, my dear cousin," she replied, sharply, pouting her fresh lips. "You don't need to smile at all, sir; I am sure I should have preferred their company to yours. But see! here comes aunt-O, I am going to tell her all about your rudeness." 
                  "Do, if you please." 
                  Mrs. Preston approached, expressed her pleasure to see so many friends, listened for one moment to the complaining Carrie, then turned toward her daughter and said: 
                  "Hannah, there are several guests here whom you have not yet welcomed. Go, your young friends will excuse your brief absence. I hope you will endeaver to make one and all enjoy these festive hours. Lionel," turning to her nephew, "I want you to act the host untill your uncle shall arrive to relieve you. Now, go and introduce our guests to your cousin." 
                  "Allow me to offer you my arm." 
                  Arm in arm, Lionel Harrington and Hannah Preston, as lovely as the mellow dawn in May, crossed over the soft carpet, from one end of the room to the other. All eyes were turned with admiration upon them as they bowed now here, now there, now giving a sign of recognition first to this one and then to that one. "How handsome a couple!" was the universal thought. 
                  And so they were. 
                  Lionel was but a few years older than Hannah. He was a tall, comely youth, with a fair skin, blue eyes and auburn hair. He bore the reputation of possessing both life and wit, and had it not been for his ungovernable temper, which would at times have the better of him, he might have been a universal favorite. He loved Hannah Preston, and she loved him in return, simply with that difference, that her feelings toward him were those of a cousin and friend, while his toward her were those of a lover and admirer. How far their sentiments were understood by each other will subsequently appear. 
                  Lionel was proud of his cousin Hannah, for she was as pure as the dew-drop, and as lovely as an angel seen through the mellowest hue of the rainbow; and Hannah loved her cousin Lionel in return, for he was handsome and brave, evincing the liveliest interest in anything that was calculated to afford pleasure to her, or to increase her happiness. 
                  With smiles upon their cheeks, and looking in each other's eyes, they eventually reached the door and passed into the reception room. 
                  No one was present. 
                  Lionel gently released his cousin's arm, but still held her hand in his. 
                  "Hannah," he said, drawing nearer and lowering his voice to a whisper, "I have never seen you look so well, and you know you were ever beautiful to my eyes." 
                  "Lionel-" 
                  "Your brow seems to be fairer, the rose on your cheeks brighter, the blue in your eyes softer, and the smile on your lips sweeter. Hannah! I love you." 
                  "And I love you," she replied, smiling. 
                  "Then promise to be mine-mine forever." 
                  "I do not understand you, Lionel," she said, endeavoring to withdraw her hand, which he, in a moment of excitement, had passed fervently between his own. "You are in a jesting humor this evening." 
                  "In a strange humor, perhaps, but not in a jesting one," he added, with a seriousness that could not be mistaken. "Hannah, I love you, promise to become mine." 
                  He was about to raise her hand to his lips, but she anticipated this movement, freed herself from his grasp, raised her figure proudly erect, stepped back a little, riveted her flashing eyes upon his face, and said, in a calm, dignified tone: 
                  "You forget yourself, Mr. Harrington." 
                  "Hannah, I may have been abrupt, rude"- 
                  "Let's speak no longer on this topic. Will you introduce me to the guests?" 
                  Once more they entered the drawing-room arm in arm, but the smile had fled from their cheeks, and the happiness from their eyes. Lionel Harrington's first intentions were to conduct his cousin back to her mother, but before he had got half way across the hall he saw the impropriety and bad policy of such a movement, and, putting as good a face upon the matter as he could, changed his mind, and with it his tactics. 
                  "Miss Preston," he commenced, concealing his chagrin, "with your permission I will introduce you now to those guests who have not yet the honor to know you." 
                  "If you please, sir." 
                  They retired to the opposite side of the room. 
                   
                  "Miss Preston, allow me to introduce to you-Mr. Carlisle-Mr. Allen." 
                  The gentlemen rose to their feet. 
                  Miss Preston drooped her eyes to the floor, lowered her head, and whispered their names. They knew Mr. Harrington, who now entered upon a conversation with them, giving his cousin an opportunity to look around the room. The guests wore happy, smiling faces, and merriment seemed the order of the evening. Beauty and wealth were represented; it pleased Hannah's vanity, for she was very proud. With an inward gratification she gazed from one extremity of the hall to the other, until a certain object-until then unnoticed by her-arrested her wandering gaze, and drew it upon itself. 
                  Apart from the rest of the guests, on one of the least prominent seats, reclined a young gentleman, who was apparently not over twenty years of age. He was of medium hight, lithe and slenderly built, and attired in a suit of plain black cloth. His face was as fair, pale, and clear as the moon seen through the mirror of the lake, and his features as calm and regular as if drawn by the hand of God upon the brow of an angel. His eyes were soft, black and dreamy, expressing mildness, depth and suffering. His lips were thin and pale, from under which a row of small pearly teeth peeped forth in whiteness vying with the purest ivory. His nose was of a Grecian style, small and elegantly cut. His hair was black, long and glossy, falling loosely over his shoulders. Hannah gazed at this retired stranger with a sense of admiration and astonishment. Never before had she seen so sad, and yet so lovely a face. Its beauty was unearthly, reminding her of the ideal-of sweet dreams-of a faint mirror of heaven-of a thought of love faintly visible through the pale light of the moon. 
                  Mr. Harrington bowed to Mr. Carlisle and Mr. Allen, and conducted his cousin to some other guests. 
                  "Who is this stranger dressed in black?" inquired Hannah, as they halted a few paces from where the handsome gentleman sat who had attracted her attention. "Who is he?" 
                  "He is your father's new book-keeper," he replied, and a frown swept across his brow. 
                  "Will you introduce him to me?" 
                  "He is a Jew." 
                  The stranger must have overheard the expression, for a faint blush rose to his cheeks and a smile curled his thin lips. He raised his face and encountered the eyes of Hannah. She evaded their gaze-passed him even without bowing. It was an insult, so studied and undisguised, that it made his heart bleed, and made him feel at a loss whether he should retire or remain. While thus pondering over this matter, Mr. Newton Preston, leading his cousin Carrie by the arm, approached him, and said: 
                  "You seem to be quite alone, Mr. Arm hold. Come, promenade with us. Miss Harrington," turning to his cousin, "allow me to introduce you to Mr. Armhold." 
                  "Mr. Armhold." 
                  "Miss Harrington." 
                  "Join us, Mr. Armhold," continued Mr. Preston, "and I will wager with you any amount that my cousin here will spare you the exertion of speaking much, for, I assure you, she is peculiarly gifted in the use of her tongue. Now, I do not wish you to understand that she will continually rattle away; no, indeed; but one thing is certain-taciturnity is not one of her failings," and Newton laughed. 
                  "Fie! for shame! cousin, to give me no better recommendation, than thus to expose my weakness to a gentleman I desired to fascinate at first sight with my charms and accomplishments," she remarked, smiling, her large blue eyes coquettishly turned upon her cousin's face. "I am strongly inclined to deprive you of the honor of escorting me any longer, and will at once throw myself upon the generosity of Mr. Armhold, if for no other reason, than to convince him by my conduct of the injustice you have done me." 
                  "You know that I have long since grown tired of your company, and only sought a good opportunity of getting rid of it," replied Newton, mock seriously. 
                  "Indeed!" she replied, pouting her beautiful red lips, and then, turning to Mr. Armhold, she raised her dancing eyes to his undisturbed, handsome features, "will you suffer my cousin to offend me in this manner? No, you will not; I appeal to your better nature to relieve me of my unwilling escort." 
                  A faint smile began to play in the curves of Mr. Armhold's lips, and a slight blush rose to his cheeks as he replied in a voice that fell upon her ears like the soft and dulcet cooing of a happy turtle-dove: 
                  "If Mr. Preston will resign his esteemed cousin to me, my gratitude shall only be surpassed by the extreme happiness the pleaure and honor of your company will lavish upon me." 
                  "Well," said Newton, releasing Carrie's arm. "I give you possession of her, even without a bill of sale." 
                  He indulged in some other seasonable remarks, then retired to another part of the drawing-room. By this time all the guests felt at ease; laughter and song swelled the air. 
                  "Let us sit down," said Carrie Harrington, after her cousin had withdrawn, "for I am much tired. There, Mr. Armhold, on you divan let us recline;" it is my favorite seat, and will just accommodate a lady and a gentleman;" and, arm in arm, they started off. 
                   
                  As usual, when strangers meet for the first time, their conversation was rather fragmentary, and principally touching upon such topics which are the most barren of interest to young people, but still most generally resorted to for the want of finding something better to say. First they spoke of the gratification of having become acquainted with one another; then the state of their health was inquired into, after which the weather was discussed, and then again the state of their health received full attention for the second time. But with a disposition as Carrie possessed, the conversation, most naturally, had to become more enlivened, and Mr. Armhold soon felt himself more at ease and grew less taciturn. 
                  "Miss Harrington," he remarked among other things, in a voice low and musical, and his dark, dreamy eyes modestly raised to her face, which was as rosy as the heaven kissed by the sun at eve-"Miss Harrington, 'tis true, that these guests, with few exceptions, are strangers to me, yet permit me, in thanking you, also to decline the honor of having myself presented to them. I am confident that an acquaintance with me is neither sought by them, nor would it add, in the least, to their pleasure." 
                  "Sir, you are much too modest." 
                  "Miss Harrington, I am an Israelite-if not in faith, at least by birth-and am fully conscious of the prejudice a Christian entertains for one of my people. Believe me, I should have remained absent from here even this evening had not Mr. Preston-your kind uncle-tendered me so polite an invitation, which it would have been rude in me to decline." 
                  "I hope that you have had so far no cause to regret your coming here," replied Carrie, lowering her voice, and her full, blue orbs resting on his handsome face. "I will promise you, that we, or at least I, shall leave nothing undone to make you spend these hours pleasantly at my uncle's house. But now, to something else. Do you know, that I imagine to have seen you before, Mr. Armhold? Come, raise your face-you don't need to be ashamed of it: it is the prettiest I have ever seen-and let me look into your eyes." 
                  He raised his head, beautiful as that of a young god, combed with his fingers the few black curls, which were loosely straying down his forehead, over his brow, then encountered her gaze, now so fondly bent upon him. 
                  "Your name is Edgar-is it not? It is! it is!" she exclaimed, joyfully, "it is! I knew that we had met before." 
                  A blush rose upon the cheeks of the handsome youth, as he replied: 
                  "My name is Edgar, but where and when I had the pleasure of meeting you, I must plead guilty of not remembering now." 
                  "Look at me," she said, smiling. 
                  "Pardon me; I must again plead guilty." 
                  "Do you not remember to have met a little, naughty, red-headed girl, some six or seven years ago, when you-I thought then I should never forget you--came to this very house one cold winter evening, for the purpose of selling aunt some goods? Have you forgotten that I conducted you to her room, and then again back into the kitchen? Have you forgotten it?" 
                  Edgar gazed intently at the smiling beauty by his side, and as the past flashed across his memory, a scarlet flush spread across his cheeks, and made them look as crimson as the eastern sky at dawn. Their first interview, with the incidents connected with it, lived again vividly in his thoughts. But what a change! Then she was a laughing, mischievous, little girl-now: a dazzling, handsome, blooming young lady, fresh as the budding rose, and whose full, developed figure and fiery look indicated that the mellow flame in the lucious heaven of her eyes was no longer that of a child, but that of a woman, kindled by those tender passions which now swelled her heaving bosom, pervaded her whole system, and radiated from her countenance. 
                  "I do remember you," he said, modestly. 
                  Carrie did not reply, but moved a little closer to his side, and fondly watched the expression of his classic features. This disconcerted our young hero in no small degree, for he was naturally unpretending and timid. Consequently he lowered his head, and allowed his long, dreamy lashes partly to fall over his eyes. This modesty made him seem that much the prettier. 
                  She was charmed by the rich music of his voice-conquered by the deep intensity of his look. She loved him-she did not ask herself how that feeling was awakened in her bosom; she knew that it was there-she did not care to know more. 
                  How unearthly beautiful he appeared to her! How sad, sweet, and yet so serene, his mien! How thoughtful and expressive his noble brow! How wondrously fair and translucent its complexion! And then his long, black hair, soul-melting eyes, small Grecian nose, pale oval cheeks, thin lips, and the faint smile that hovered upon them, how it appealed to her youthful imagination and inspired it with thoughts of heavenly love! 
                  "And you would not have recognized me again?" she murmured, in a low, sad cadence. 
                  Edgar looked up and saw a bright smile in her eye. 
                  "And I should have known you among a thousand," she continued, in the same, low strain; "you see, the impression your image left upon my mind has outlived the impression the image of the little, ugly, red-headed girl left upon yours." 
                  "When sorrow hangs, like sable clouds, over our thoughts, all past objects, however bright, seem dim and are lost in the midnight night which enshrouds our memory, and excludes all light, he replied, meekly." 
                  "Mr. Armhold, I am grieved to see you so sad and unhappy." 
                  "Sad, but not unhappy." 
                  Carrie did not understand him. How should she? Was she not born in the pliant lap of wealth and rocked in the soft cradle of luxury? 
                  "My uncle speaks in high terms of you," she said, after a short interval, thinking that this information would please Edgar. "He said but yesterday, that he never had a more trustworthy youth in his office." 
                  "I am thankful to your uncle for his good opinion, and shall strive daily to become more worthy of it," he replied, slightly lowering his head, in acknowledgment of the compliment. 
                  A silence of some minutes ensued. 
                  "You don't visit much? Do you, Mr. Armhold?" 
                  "No, ma'am." 
                  "Won't you come and visit me?" she asked, naively. 
                  How fondly she gazed at him! Will he refuse it? 
                  "Miss Harrington," he said, "it would afford me great pleasure to call on you, but-"and here the serenity vanished from his brow, and was succeeded by an expression of pride which paled his cheeks and sharpened the curves around his lips, "but I fear you do not know me. I am a mere book-keeper and-a Jew." 
                  She thought he looked like a young Apollo. 
                  "I am not proud," she said. 
                  "But I am," he replied, with dignity, and his eyes seemed to grow darker. It was his proud soul that shone through their unfathomable depth and lent them this unearthly intensity. 
                  "So am I proud," said Carrie, forcibly, drawing nearer to him-"so am I proud-proud of you." 
                  Again their eyes met and Carrie's knee touched that of Edgar. What was it, that made her bosom heave, fired her soul and sent a thrill of unearthly pleasure through every part of her system? What was it, that called up such sweet sensations in her bosom, and made her feel as if undergoing a liquefying process, producing an ecstatic abandonment-a pleasing helplessness? What was it that gave her now a foretaste of heaven? 
                  Still they gazed upon each other with eyes which seemed melting away in their sockets, so soft and mellow were their glances. 
                  "Will you come and see me at my father's?" she asked him, at length, lowering her voice to a whisper. 
                  It was Edgar's intention to be firm, and at once decline an invitation he knew would result in no good to him; but he had hardly formed this resolution when the siren's voice rang again in his ear, when the soft breath of her lips fell upon his cheeks, when her knee slightly touched his, and his purpose failed him, and he murmured: 
                  "Miss Harrington, I shall take the pleasure." 
                  "Call me Carrie," she said, wistfully looking at him. 
                  "It is a privilege to which as yet I am not entitled." 
                  "Why not?" she added; "Have we not known each other for six years, and don't all my friends call me by that name? And are you not the warmest friend I have? Come, call me Carrie-you know when first we met you called me Carrie and I called you Edgar-for I should always feel a peculiar restraint upon my actions were I to suffer you to be so punctilious as to do otherwise." 
                  "Carrie," said her brother Lionel, who was just approaching them, frowning down upon Edgar, "aunt has sent for you to join her at once in her room." 
                  "Brother, this is Mr. Armhold. Have you the pleasure of knowing him?" 
                  "We have met frequently," he replied coldly. "Carrie, your aunt is expecting you. Mr. Armhold will excuse you." 
                  "Most certainly." 
                  There was little studied grace about Carrie Harrington-all her charms were natural. Now she bounced up from the divan, cast another lascivious glance at Edgar, rattled off a few hurried sentences, wished him much pleasure, then retired with her brother. 
                  "What can aunt want of me?" she inquired, evincing considerable displeasure at having been called away from Edgar's company. 
                  "I don't know. Go in and find it out;" and Lionel led her across the hall, then retraced his steps. 
                  Carrie opened the door, and found her aunt reclining on a small settee at the further end of the room. Mrs. Preston looked, if any thing, a little paler, thinner, and more dignified, than when we first saw her some six years ago. As her niece approached, she raised her calm, serene face and gazed for some minutes in her eyes, after which she commenced in a slow measured tone: 
                  "Carrie, I am much dissatisfied with your conduct this evening." 
                  "Why, aunt?" asked Carrie, astonished. 
                  "Can you ask why, and for a moment dwell upon your behavior? Have you no more pride-no more honor-than to sit so long-and in what a position!-by the side of a young man without wealth, standing or reputation, until all eyes were turned upon you? Have you no more respect than to neglect the host of fashionable guests, whose acquaintance you should have been proud to cultivate, and to gain whose friendship should have been of the greatest importance to you?" 
                  "Aunt-" Carrie was about to remonstrate. 
                  "Don't say any thing in extenuation of your conduct, for to excuse wrong but makes it worse. Your manners are too familiar for a lady who just enters society, desiring to leave a good impression and command universal respect. You are too free, Carrie-too thoughtless. I have been grieved to notice this on several occasions, and particularly so this evening." 
                  "Aunt, you do me wrong." 
                  "Had you and this young man, to whom you seemed to have taken a particular fancy, been affianced lovers-had you been closeted in a room by yourselves-even then your modesty should've taught you more reserve and self-respect. Carrie, if you wish to remain Hannah's companion; If you do not desire to offend me, and impair your reputation just as you are entering life in reality-I pray you, Carrie-assume a dignity if you possess it not. Now you may return to the drawing-room." 
                  "Aunt, I meant no wrong," pleaded the reprimanded maiden, wiping a tear from her eyes. 
                  "Return to the drawing-room and do better." 
                  A few minutes later Carrie joined her brother whom she met at the door, and was introduced by him to a young friend of his who was seated but a short distance from Hannah. He was a very comely and entertaining youth, and she soon forgot, in the pleasure of his society, the pain her aunt's reprimand had caused. Just then she saw her uncle and Edgar approach her cousin Hannah. "Isn't he a handsome youth?" she said to her companion, and a bright flush spread over her cheeks, while Hannah's face turned paler, evincing a displeasure which it seemed she did not care to conceal. 
                  "Daughter," said Mr. Preston, "this is Mr. Armhold, the young gentleman of whom you have heard me speak so often." 
                  Hannah slowly rose to her feet, made a slight bow, and then sat down again. 
                  There was a peculiar pride and haughtiness about her cold looks and marble features that did not escape Edgar, who, as soon as Mr. Preston had retired, advanced a step-but not to occupy the vacant seat by her side-and said, in a low, musical voice: 
                  "Miss Preston, allow me to congratulate you on this, the sixteenth anniversary of your birthday. May your path be amid a bed of flowers; may you ever remain a stranger to sorrow while on earth, and when your spirit once seeks its home in heaven may it be as pure as it seems this evening, and its reward as great as I hope it is pure." 
                  Hannah was looking toward the floor while Edgar spoke to her. His voice penetrated her soul-it was so sweet and yet so sad. 
                  As soon as the last sound of it died away, she raised her head and encountered that steady, thoughtful gaze which had first attracted her attention. 
                  "Thank you," she whispered, and once more her eyes searched the floor. A few minutes later she raised her head, but Mr. Armhold was no longer by her side-was no longer in the room. "He is at least not devoid of self-respect," she thought, and rose to join Carrie, who had been watching her for some time with a jealous eye. 
                  "Isn't he handsome?" exclaimed the latter as her cousin approached. 
                  "Who?" inquired Hannah. 
                  "Who? Edgar-" 
                  "Edgar?" 
                  "I mean Mr. Armhold;" and Carrie's face glowed crimson. 
                  At the door of the outer hall stood Lionel Harrington and Edgar Armhold. 
                  "And this is the principal cause of your unfriendliness toward me?" said the latter. 
                  "It is," replied Carrie's brother. "The blow you gave to Lionel Harrington the boy, is still remembered by Lionel Harrington the man Look at this mark on my forehead,"-and he removed some hair from his left temple-"look at it; it is the blow your fist once dealt me that made this mark." 
                  "Mr. Harrington, my hand never gave that blow, for if it had my lips should not be slow in acknowledging it." 
                  "Do you deny it?" 
                  "I do, Mr. Harrington." 
                  "You do?" 
                  "I do." 
                  Lionel frowned and looked upon him with contempt. He despised a man who had not the courage to avow his deeds. 
                  "Will you fight?" he said. 
                  "No." 
                  "Then you are a coward." 
                  Edgar turned as white as snow; his lips began to tremble, and his eyes grew blacker and deeper. He was no coward, for he had long since become master over his passions and had learned to subdue them. He was a mighty hero: he had conquered himself. 
                  "I do not fight," he said, calmly, and retraced his steps. 
                  Lionel still lingered in the hall. He was not in the mood to join his friends. He paced up and down the floor, when the door of the house flew open, and a youth, upon whose hands and garments were the signs of blood, rushed toward him, asking: 
                  "Where is Edgar Armhold?" 
                  The stranger could say no more. He was almost out of breath, and his cheeks were as pale as the moon that shone upon them. Lionel looked at him, and was struck with amazement. Never before had he seen so great a resemblance. It was the person who had struck him; he could not be mistaken in those flashing eyes, and in their reckless expression. They were the same he had seen six years ago bent upon him. 
                  "Who are you?" 
                  "Where is Edgar Armhold?" shrieked the stranger, trying to pass Lionel, who, however, griped him by the collar, and, confronting him, said: 
                  "Who are you?" 
                  "Let me be, or your blood shall pay for it!" 
                  "What do you want?" 
                  "To be released!" and with one jerk he tore himself loose from Lionel's grasp, dashed him violently to the floor, and rushed into the drawing-room. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              When prejudice and strong aversions work, 
                              All whose opinions we dislike are atheists. 
                              Now 'tis a term of art, a bugbear word, 
                              The villain's engine, and the vulgar's terror; 
                              The man who thinks and judges for himself, 
                              Unsway'd by aged follies, reverend errors, 
                              Grown holy by traditionary dullness 
                              Of school authority, he is an atheist. 
                              The man who, hating idle noise, preserves 
                              A pure religion seated in his soul, 
                              He is a silent, dumb, dissembling atheist! 
                           
                         
                        SEWELL'S SIR WALTER RALEIGH. 
                      
                   
                  AFTER Edgar Armhold had left his employer's house and passed through Avondale, he slowly made his way back to the city. The various incidents of the evening still occupied his mind. The cool reception he had received at the hands of Miss Hannah Preston, the strange recognition by Miss Carrie Harrington, her unfeigned manifestation of joy, her free and indiscreet conduct, the peculiar sensation it had awakened in his youthful bosom, her request, his promise, and, at last, his unpleasant interview with Lionel, in turn, crossed his memory and became food for reflection. 
                  And Edgar was peculiarly a thinking youth. 
                  The poor, generally, think and reflect more than the rich. They will study and be silent while the others wag their tongues. 
                  The poor are also reserved and taciturn. They hear and listen, but say little and confess less. They are the repositories from which nothing, save a good example, can be extracted. 
                  This reserve and reflection make them superior to the large mass of pampered rich, who are continually talking and laughing, and are cursed with the ambition to express in the eloquence of a toad the sublimity of an ass. 
                  By the "poor" we mean that class of beings, which is singled out by the wisdom of God to feel the weight of oppression in its various forms. 
                  Edgar Armhold belonged to that chosen class. 
                  Already in his infancy-for some wise purpose, no doubt-he had been made acquainted with the dark and frowning face of existence. He knew nothing of a sunny side until he was old enough to go abroad and find out that the privileged few only prospered under its beneficent light. Away from home was all happiness, while in the household of his father poverty, sickness and discontent gave life a gloomy aspect. At home he was sad-abroad he was thoughtful. Is it a wonder? No. 
                  This contrast was indelibly written on the tablets of his memory; it was constantly hanging before his eyes. Do he what he will, go he where he may, he felt the influence of the impressions it had left there. 
                  When he saw a peaceful family, he sadly thought of his own. When he came where wealth abounded, he remembered the many nights he had been sent hungry to bed. When he saw the hale and healthy, he thought of his infirm parents, and was sad. 
                  Edgar was peculiarly sensitive; the unfortunate are ever so; a harsh word sounds doubly harsh to them. The rich don't know that; they look at every thing from a different stand-point; they weigh the offence on the rusty scales of their own callousness, and thereby diminish its magnitude. They do not know that a harsh word can make hearts bleed; or, knowing it, they are too hardened to care for it. 
                  But to return to our story, else we shall be thought tedious. Life is short, and hence the unwillingness of mankind to pause, reflect and philosophize. Therefore, to our story. 
                  Some three years ago Edgar had made the acquaintance of a person whom he had never seen before, and whom, of all mankind, he then least cared to know. The people knew him by the name of Joseph Joseph, an apostate from the Jewish faith, a man who disbelieved in the existence of a God, and had had the audacity to avow it in public. Every Jew shunned his society, as if it had been contamination to come in contact with him. The children were taught to despise and loathe him, and his seclusion from the world was construed into misanthropy and malevolence. 
                  To this man's cottage Edgar now turned his steps. He gently tapped at his door. It was soon after opened from the inside by a benevolent-looking old man, with snow-white hair and snow-white beard. 
                  It was Joseph Joseph, a man who had reached the great age of three scores and ten- 
                  The world-the religious world-called him by the name of apostate, atheist, infidel, pantheist, rationalist, &c.; Edgar called him father Joseph. 
                  It is a sad truth that Israel continually suffers by the intolerance of other churches, but it is a still sadder truth that Israel is more intolerant than all the other churches combined. It clamors incessantly for religious liberty and freedom of thought, yet denies its own sons the rights it claims from others for itself. 
                  O, that we could see ourselves as we are, and could listen to the truth! 
                  The room into which Edgar was admitted was comfortably furnished. It contained a bedstead, several chairs, a table, a writing-desk, a book-case, and a wash-stand. Several books and manuscripts lay scattered about on the various pieces of furniture, making one suppose that Joseph Joseph loved to drink from the fountain of knowledge. 
                  An oil-lamp, which emitted a dim light, stood on the table, in the center of the room. A bright coal-fire was burning in the hearth; two chairs were in front of it, upon which Joseph Joseph-or, as Edgar called him, father Joseph-and his guest seated themselves. 
                  These two men-one just entering the world, the other about to leave it; one still an Israelite, the other a pantheist-had found their souls congenial, and loved each other. At their first interview they had formed a friendship, which seemed likely to last through life. 
                  On this evening, among other things, these remarks were made: 
                  "Edgar, my son," said father Joseph, the benevolent expression of his face changing into one of beatitude and grandeur, "fear not for me. I shall be happy in the future world, though I have renounced the religion of Israel, and have strayed from the house of my fathers. Why should I be punished? What wrong have I committed? Whom have I offended?" 
                  "My God-your God-the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob!" fell solemnly from the lips of Edgar. 
                  "My God? your God?-There is no God." 
                  As he said this, a tear came to his eyes, and rolled down his cheeks upon his snow-white beard. 
                  "This would be worse than blasphemy, had it fallen from any other lips but yours," said Edgar, gazing on the serene brow of the old man. 
                  "You have been taught to think so, my son, and I do not wish to shake your belief." 
                  "I have been taught to love God and pray to Him daily." 
                  "Pray to Him, my son, and may it be a source of happiness to you." 
                  "What would become of society were your doctrines generally promulgated among mankind?" whispered Edgar, after an interval of several minutes. 
                  "It would become a band of brothers;" and father Joseph raised his head erect, and a strange fire gleamed from his eyes. Edgar, as he looked upon him, imagined he beheld a spirit risen from the dead, to prophesy in the dying. 
                  "And are we not now a band of brothers?" 
                  "A band of robbers, my son-a band of robbers." 
                  "I never heard you speak so harshly." 
                  "Yet I never loved as much as now." 
                  "And still you call mankind a band of robbers?" 
                  The old man drew a little nearer to the fire, the pale light of which played upon his serene features. 
                  "Look around you, my son," he continued, solemnly, "and see the universal suffering of our benighted race. Aye, there is not a heart but what bleeds, at times, and feels the keenest of agonies. Who inflicts these wounds? Say not that it is a God who causes this general wail, for I am but an erring creature, yet I should know-aye, should know-that God beneath me, who styles himself Father of this universe, and could delight in the sufferings of his children." 
                  "He does not delight-" 
                  "Then why not banish, or, rather, why cause this misery?" 
                  "To try our faith and make us worthy of heaven." 
                  "Why try our faith?" 
                  Edgar remained silent, and father Joseph continued: 
                  "Nay, my son, it is not God who afflicts us; it is the belief in the existence of a God. It is that what has made us blind, and taught us to look for assistance from whence none could be obtained. This false reliance, this mental darkness, made barbarians of us, and is the destroyer of our happiness. I said 'barbarians,' for this term conveys the idea best." 
                  "We live in an age of civilization." 
                  "Civilization, my son?" and the old man shook his head in sadness. "Civilization, did you say? Have you forgotten that we are still unable to command ourselves? that we are still in need of rulers? that we still need our courts of justice? that we still have our penitentiaries and criminals? that the State still needs its sheriffs, the city her policemen, each street a watchman, each house a task-master? Have you forgotten that we rob men of life-a thing we can not return? that we contract diseases which produce death? that we have corrupted systems which foster diseases? that we have ill-trained passions which destroy our happiness? that we have priests who command kings? that we have kings who command ministers? that we have ministers who control the judges? that we have judges who confound the law? that we have a law which only protects the rich man? That we have rich men who may defy justice? that we have the lawyer who wrongs, robs and oppresses the poor man? that poverty makes the robber, and despair the murderer? Have you forgotten that the farmer enslaves the beast? the rich townsman the farmer? the minister the rich townsman? the king and executive the minister? the priests the king and executive? and ignorance enslaves the priest, through him the church, and through it all mankind? Have you forgotten all this, my son? Pause and reflect." 
                  The old man said no more, but gazed down upon the ineffably handsome youth, who, raising his dreamy and unfathomable eyes toward the serene and solemn countenance of the shunned and hermitical apostate, remarked deferentially: 
                  "I have often paused and reflected, father Joseph, and though, at times, I may have doubted, I still, after pondering over this subject more, thought to see, and came to admire, the wise measures adopted by society for the purpose or suppressing wrong and violence among the members of which it is composed." 
                  A faint, sad smile passed for a moment over the face of the hoary sage, as he listened to the remark of the gentle youth by his side. 
                  "Old is the world, my son," he said, after a short pause, "and necessity has taught society to make laws to protect itself, and yet no moment recedes from the Present into the Past but is marked with tears and blood. Not a moment but has heard the wails of the sick and of the dying; but has seen the abuse of power and the oppression of the weak; not a twinkling of an eye but has witnessed the misery of the disappointed and the despair of the helpless. Could we, for an instant, feel our own individuality, separate ourselves from the multitude and banish its influence upon our judgment, then seat ourselves on the clouds and watch the spectacle on earth, we would see a mass of beings ever busy, ever stirring, ever grasping, ever hoarding, ever robbing, and ever building upon the ruins of others. We would see tears of sorrow, and would hear cries of pain; we would see the poor man imprisoned who steals a loaf of bread for his starving children, and the rich man, who robs the former of his honest living, in the palace. We would see the misery of the many, and the happiness of the few. We would see the tempted, the faltering, the falling and the fallen, we would also see the sages in conclave to make laws to punish criminals. We would see societies to protect their members from want; societies that labor for the amelioration of the poor; that attend to the orphans and widows; but we would not see," and here his voice became so low and solemn, that a strange feeling pervaded Edgar's bosom, "nay, we would not see a single man who would look into himself to discover in how far he is responsible for his neighbors sufferings." 
                  "But still you acknowledge the existence of many societies, whose aim and object are the amelioration of the poor and the sick, the orphan and the widow? Does this not show a high state of culture-an advanced civilization?" 
                  Again the old sage sadly shook his silver head. 
                  "These many institutions," he said, after a short pause, "which are spread far and wide across the land, are but as so many evidences of the barbarism of the human family." 
                  "In how far, father Joseph?" 
                  "In as far a prisons are evidences of the existence of criminals. The former is the result of the latter. Had there been no criminals, we never should have had a prison-house. Were the barbarism of mankind and its tyranny over the weaker portion of the human family only a myth, where would be the necessity to invent so many measures for self-protection? The very existence of benevolent institutions indicates, at the same time, the existence of poverty-of misery." 
                  Edgar seemed absorbed in thought. After a short interval he raised his head, and said: 
                  "And yet society has ever been mindful of its duties and obligation. It has established tribunals of justice; it has made laws to protect itself, and is never slow in punishing the offender." 
                  "There lies the error, my son," said father Joseph, gravely. "It has made laws to punish the offender, but none to keep him from offending. It meets one wrong with another. It has no laws how to make us good, but how to punish the bad. There lies the error, my son; there lies the error." 
                  "The fear of punishment keeps many from offending." 
                  "Fear never begets love; and only through love can we be happy." 
                  "I will admit this, father Joseph, and regret that we do not love each other more. I am too young to know the cause," continued Edgar, "that sets brother against brother and thereby disturbs that happiness which all of us crave but few of us enjoy." 
                  "You will learn to know it, son," replied the hoary sage, gently stroking the black hair of the other, "when you have grown older and seen more of society." 
                  "May the God of Israel teach us to love one another!" fervently exclaimed the youth, raising his pale face toward heaven. 
                  "Could prayers to God bring about this happy result we should long since have been a band of brothers; for the tears of the widow and orphan, and the cries of the hungry and starving have pleaded the cause of humanity from the infancy of creation. But," and he sadly shook his head, "evil still abounds, and prayers are still offered." 
                  "And still we live in hope." 
                  "And die in disappointment." 
                  "He need not fear death who fears God." 
                  "He need not fear God, who loves his fellow-men. Therefore, my son, look into your own heart, turn your eyes inward and see yourself; and when you have learned to know yourself, the motives that actuate you, the causes that led to these motives, and you have discovered that each cause is but the result, the effect of other causes-causes beyond our will or control-then you will absolve man from all crimes, and learn to pity instead of hating him. Remember that love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage. He who can love the man who has wronged him is both wise and noble; but he who has conquered himself, who can bear and subdue all his passions, who can smile while Fortune frowns upon him and man misunderstands and persecutes him, who can lay bare his breast to the poised arrows of hate, envy, malice, and prejudice, who can weep at the grief of a child and can receive a blow with a smile, exhibits the sublimest courage on earth. Remember this, my son,-remember this." 
                  The old man said no more. He lowered his head upon his bosom, and became absorbed in thought. 
                  "You would absolve the murderer?" remarked Edgar. 
                  "I would." 
                  "And hold responsible-" 
                  "Ignorance, which is the mother of all crimes." 
                  "O, teach me to understand you, father Joseph!" 
                  "Abide the time, my son. Observation and a knowledge of mankind will bring you nearer me and happiness." 
                  "Are you happy?" 
                  "I am." 
                  A half hour later Edgar might have been seen leaving the cot of the old man, pondering, as he slowly walked along, over the peculiar doctrines he had propounded. The first time he had heard father Joseph deny the existence of a God, which was some years previous to this interview, he had felt a strange horror-a feeling of awe and dread-for the man; but eventually he had grown more accustomed to his remarks, and now he could listen to them with composure, and even reflect over them. 
                  He had unwittingly imbibed the spirit of his preceptor, and adopted his dogmas, without being aware of it himself. He was just repeating the apothegm, that "Love is the greatest virtue and forbearance the sublimest courage," when his attention was drawn to a small, half-grown kitten, which was slowly and uneasily passing up and down the pavement in front of a frame cottage, the inhabitants of which were very noisy. The suffering feline mewed incessantly as if appealing to the pity both of those inside and those passing the house. Now it would mew and look at the door, and then again it would mew and raise its round, yellow eyes to the passers-by. But no one seemed to care for or understand its grief, and consequently it was suffered to freeze in the cold, nipping air of this autumn-night. When Edgar was opposite the house he stopped short, and gazed upon the poor animal in front of him, which made him still more thoughtful. Just then some one-it was a gentleman dressed in black cloth and white cravat, who evidently followed the lucrative business of preaching-was about to pass the cottage, when the kitten, as if gifted with reason but no judgement, turned her yellow eyes upon him, and sorrowfully mewed: expressing in its own way of speaking, as plainly as possible, "Won't you open this door for me? I am almost frozen; I have called on every one who passed, but no one heeded me, because I am only a little kitten. Won't you have pity on me?" This clerical business man having never studied the dialect of the feline race, it was most natural for him not to understand this appeal to his humanity. So when the kitten crossed his path and intercepted his progress, he gave it a kick with his foot which sent it half way across the street. Edgar had watched this proceeding, and a sigh escaped his thin, white lips. "And is father Joseph right? Are we barbarians?" he murmured to himself, and passed along. He had hardly gone five paces when he stopped short, looked in the direction the poor thing had fallen, then at the frame cottage from which it had been expelled. The apothegm again returned to him: "Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage," and he slowly retraced his steps, crossed into the street, picked up the half-frozen and bleeding kitten in his arms, walked up with it to the cottage, and knocked for admittance. 
                  The door was opened. 
                  "What do you want?" said a buxom girl of sixteen, dressed in gaudy silks, her lascivious eyes scanning the pale and classical features of our young hero. 
                  "Excuse me, ma'am, for the liberty of knocking at your door at so untimely an hour," he said, blushing and pointing toward the kitten he still held in his arms; "but this poor animal is freezing-" 
                  Before he could complete the sentence shouts of laughter, emanating from the girls inside of the house greeted his ear, and embarrassed him to such an extent that he lowered his head, allowed the kitten to slide from his arms, and then, without saying any thing more, turned upon his heels to leave; but the girl at the door grasped him by the arm, and asked him, while the coarse laughter of the merry crew within rung in his ears: 
                  "Will you have a stick of molasses candy?" 
                  Another shouted: 
                  "Does your mother know you're out?" 
                  Edgar cared to hear no more. He tore himself loose from the girl in silk, and, without giving another look at the house, ran down the street. 
                  "Stop!" cried a familiar voice behind him. 
                  He changed color, looked around, and beheld a young man, besmeared with blood, and almost breathless, running toward him. 
                  "Reuben!" he exclaimed in astonishment, as he recognized his brother. 
                  "Follow me into yon lane," he gasped, frightened, his eyes searching along the dark street; "follow me quickly. I am pursued. Policemen are on my track-I have killed-" 
                   
                  
                      
                        "NO, BROTHER, HERE, AT YOUR FEET, I WILL KNEEL A SUPPLIANT." 
                     
                   
                   
                   
                  He had no time to finish the sentence. 
                  "Stop him!" rung through the still night air. 
                  Whitout looking back, Reuben recommenced his flight, and soon after disappeared in a long, dark alley, which led into the most disreputable part of the city. 
                  Edgar turned and gazed up the street. He discovered several policemen at a short distance from him, as if in consultation. Soon he saw them run also down the alley, but some few squares ahead of him, as if they had discovered the maneuver of their victim, whose retreat they intended to cut off. 
                  Edgar was almost rooted to the ground. He passed his hand across his forehead in order to collect his thoughts. Was it a horrible dream from which he had awakened? Hark! he hears the reports of one-two-three guns. It was no dream-it was a sad reality! 
                  He nervously buttoned up this thin, black coat, and sped-his long, black hair wildly flying in the air-in the direction from which the loud reports had come. 
                  We shall not follow him. 
                  It was near midnight when he reached home, and noiselessly entered the room. There a sad, pitiful, and heart-rending spectacle greeted his sight. Upon a low couch lay his father, unable to move his limbs and his arms; in front of it stood his blind mother, sobbing aloud, with swarthy Ruth, whose head was buried in her little apron, by her side. 
                  "What is the matter?" said Edgar, in a low, sad, sad voice, while his face exhibited in the dim light of the moon, which stole in through the window, the paleness of a corpse. "What is the matter?" he repeated, and drew nearer, when be observed, for the first time, that his father's features were strangely distorted, and his eyes wildly rolling in their sockets. 
                  "Father!" he cried. 
                  But the old man did not-could not-reply. Apoplexy had struck him during the night, paralyzed his right side, and palsied his tongue. 
                  Edgar gazed upon the mute sufferer without shedding a solitary tear. His grief had closed all the avenues to the heart, and deprived it for a moment of all sensibility. But soon he turned to his blind and sobbing mother, and raising his sad and dreamy eyes upward, whispered, in a low, clear voice, trembling as it fell from his thin, ashy lips: 
                  "Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage." 
                  A faint smile stole over his pale and serene features, and, in the dim light of the moon, gave them a strangely vague and unearthly sad expression. 
                  "Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Ye good distressed! 
                              Ye noble few! who here unbending stand 
                              Beneath life's pressure, yet bear up awhile, 
                              And what your bounded view, which only saw, 
                              A little part, deem'd evil, is no more; 
                              The storms of wintry time will quickly pass, 
                              And one unbounded spring encircle all. 
                           
                         
                        THOMSON'S SEASONS. 
                      
                   
                  ON the following morning, at sunrise, Edgar Armhold might have been seen walking up and down Ninth street, reading, as he went along, the door-plate of each house he was passing. 
                  At the time of this history, Ninth street was adorned, as it is yet, with several elegant mansions, before one of which, after reading the name, our young hero halted, and, entering the front gate and ascending a few marble steps, approached the door and rang the bell. 
                  "Can I see Mr. Montgomery?" he inquired of the portly servant who had answered this early summons. 
                  "I don't think you can, sir," she replied; "Mr. Montgomery is still abed and sick. Perhaps you don't know that somebody wanted to murder him last night-" Edgar's face turned a shade paler, and his lips a little bluer, but save these there was no other change perceptible-"yes, somebody wanted to kill him, but the timely arrival of the police frustrated the villain's design upon my master's life. The fellow undoubtedly fled with the belief of having committed murder, for he had first knocked my master down, then stabbed him." 
                  "Will you please inquire whether Mr. Montgomery is awake, and if he is, request of him an audience for me, as I have business of importance to transact with him?" 
                  "But I know he is too sick to receive anybody, were it even later in the day. I would advise you to call some other time." 
                  "Be kind enough to see whether he has already risen, as I would like to have an interview with him on business in reference to the calamity from which he so narrowly escaped." 
                  "What!" exclaimed the loquacious matron, "have you found out whither the murderer has fled?-you know I have a perfect right to call him so, for he would have been a murderer had the police not interfered. And you know where he is concealed?" she continued, planting her unwieldly body firmly on the floor, placing her broad hands on her broader hips, while her dull gray eyes astonishingly fixed upon our hero's serene face. 
                  "Who would have thought of such good luck? Won't Mr. Montgomery open wide his eyes? Won't he though?" and she turned around and ascended the stairs. 
                  Five minutes later she returned with the information that her master was up, and ready to receive the visitor. 
                  Edgar was at once conducted up one flight of stairs, and ushered into a handsomely furnished room, in which an elderly gentleman, whose left arm was bandaged and carried in a sling of white linen, was seated in an easy arm-chair. No sooner had the latter riveted his eyes upon the face of the new comer, than he rose to his feet, and laboring under the greatest excitement, exclaimed: 
                  "Reuben Armhold!" 
                  "No, sir; his twin brother," calmly replied Edgar, who, with hat under his arm, stood still at the door. 
                  "How dare you make your appearance at my house, after what has transpired last night? I want you to leave my presence instantly, else I shall have you ejected. Do you hear what I say? I shall have you kicked out. Or, do you think, perhaps, that I shall allow you to finish what your brother had attempted: namely, to take my life?" 
                  "Fear not, good sir, my brother-" 
                  "Shall not make good his escape," added Mr. Montgomery, again seating himself. "I shall have the police of the whole United States after him, and cost it what it will, he must be apprehended." 
                  "Mr. Montgomery, I came not here to extenuate my brother's crime. Believe me, sir, I feel the pain more keenly than if he had died an honest man and I had survived to mourn his loss," replied Edgar in his low, musical voice, raising his pale, serene face and exhibiting the sad and steady gaze of those dreamy, black eyes, which had a strange power to subdue anger and awaken in the beholder a feeling of respect and confidence. "I came here, injured sir, in behalf of a paralyzed father, whose tongue is palsied, and of a blind, infirm mother, whose life has been a long series of bitter trials-in behalf of myself, who is the only support of these old people, and which support it is in your power to destroy." 
                  "Young man," replied Mr. Montgomery, dispassionately, "I am not a hard-hearted man-never had the reputation of being such; in fact, if I have any fault, it is of being easily imposed upon-of being too good and lenient. But under the present circumstances it is my duty to show more firmness than usual, if for nothing more than to rid society of a pest I had fostered. In your brother I had placed unlimited confidence; I had intrusted him not only with my books and papers, but also with my money. I had given him a liberal salary, and never had I refused him any favor. Often had friends warned me against him, and advised me to be more circumspect. I laughed at their to me silly-seeming apprehensions, and pronounced them unfounded. Last night some business had called me to my store. After I had attended to it, and was about ready to leave, and had extinguished the light, I thought I heard some one open the front door, and stealthily steal toward the place where the safe stood. I remained quiet in order to hear, as I could not see, what was going on. A few minutes later I perceived something like a shadow glide alongside the wall and disappear through the door. Now I lighted up the office and discovered that eight hundred dollars were purloined from the safe. Quick as thought I followed the robber. What was my astonishment to recognize in him-Reuben Armhold! My first intention was to take hold of him at once and place him in the hands of justice, but after a little reflection I allowed him to pass on. I, however, followed the track of his heel, and unobserved by him. I saw him enter a coffee-house where he stayed for several hours. I did not get impatient-I waited until he left it, when I again followed him, and this time across the canal. Now he passed into a passage between two houses; I followed him into a wretched room into the third story. I told him that he was my prisoner. Soon after we were on the street where all was quiet. I questioned him; asked him to deliver the eight hundred dollars he had stolen. He said he had no money; I threatened to place him into the hands of justice; he looked around, laughed demoniacally, took me by the collar bone, and dealt me a blow on my left temple-I staggered and fell. From that moment I remembered nothing till I opened my eyes, when I found myself lying on my bed at home, this arm bandaged, having been stabbed by your brother while I had been lying insensible on the ground. Now, young man, you have heard the particulars. Do you not think I am fully justified in having the fellow apprehended?" 
                  "He deserves your pity, and not your anger," pleaded Edgar. 
                  "He deserves to be hanged," thundered the other, "but no pity. A youth of nineteen to be guilty of robbery and of an attempt at murder is not entitled to an honest man's pity. Corrupt must be the nature that can resort to such vile measures. I tell you, young man, I shall have him apprehended, and if you wish me to entertain a better opinion of you than of your brother, you will at once get out of my sight, for while I see you I think of the wretch I had fostered and of its result. So you better leave me." 
                  Edgar's cheeks turned somewhat paler and his lips began to tremble. 
                  "Pardon me, sir," he faltered, after a short pause, "O, pardon me for disobeying your command. I can not-can not go away thus. Let me stay but one moment longer-let me appeal to you to spare my dumb father and blind-stark blind mother. Be merciful to them," and here he advanced a few paces and dropped upon his knees-"for they are good, honest old people, though they have an unworthy child who disgraces their name." 
                   
                  Now Edgar lowered his head in order to suppress the bitter feelings that overpowered him. When he again raised his pale, sad face, it exhibited the serenity of heaven. 
                  "Spare them, good sir," he said, "they are already too wretched now." 
                  "This is a mere artifice-a mere subterfuge," replied the other, shaking his head, knowingly. 
                  "God knows that I speak the truth, and nothing but the truth," said Edgar, lifting his dreamy eyes heavenward. 
                  "Do you think that I would allow a man to rob me of eight hundred dollars, and beat me half to death, without exposing him? Do you take me for a fool? I hope you will have learned by this time the bent of my mind, and now I desire you to leave my presence." 
                  "When my parents will be informed of my brother's crime, they will die, sir-they will die-die. They are still unacquainted with what has transpired last night-O, keep it from their knowledge and let them live," here Edgar concealed his face in his handkerchief and wept in silence. 
                  "I understand all these tricks, young man." 
                  "They will die, sir-they will die, sir." 
                  "Young man, I have heard enough." 
                  Edgar rose to his feet, and slowly moved toward the door. There, he turned around and appealingly bent his large, briny eyes upon the stern features of Mr. Montgomery. 
                  "You can not-O, no, you can not be so cruel as to kill the parents for the crimes of their son," he said, throwing himself once more upon his knees, and lifting up both his hands. "Believe me, sir, I can not go home to my dumb father and my blind mother and break this sad news to them. No, I can not," and here the tears began freely to course down his pale cheeks, "for they have already suffered so much-O, how much! This last and greatest blow of all would consign them to the grave. Sir, they are strangers in this land-poor, afflicted strangers-without friends, without kindred; one never more to speak, the other never more to see. O, spare them-spare them; be merciful to them, and God will be merciful to you. I will work day and night until I have earned enough to pay you what my brother, in a moment of temptation, was guilty to purloin from your safe. I haven't the money now, sir, but I promise to live more economically in the future, and husband my savings, in order to liquidate the debt of my brother, for which I, henceforth, shall hold myself responsible to you." 
                  "In what house are you employed?" 
                  "In the house of James Preston & Co.", faltered Edgar, perceptibly trembling from head to foot, for he was under the impression that Mr. Montgomery would acquaint his employers of Reuben's crime, and thereby cause a loss of confidence in him (Edgar), or even his dismissal. "O, do not expose my brother's error to my employers," he continued to plead, "they will lose faith in my honesty and discharge me. Who will then support my mother and father?" 
                  Tears gushed freely from Edgar's eyes, which appealed to the mercy of Mr. Montgomery even more than the words that had been addressed to him. 
                  "What salary do you get?" 
                  "Forty dollars per month, sir." 
                  "And how much do you design to give me of said salary?" 
                  "Ten dollars, sir," he whispered, lowering his head. 
                  "Ten dollars, per month: a small installment." 
                  "I know it, sir." 
                  "Hear me, young man, so you may learn that I am not altogether a man of stone," said Mr. Montgomery, who had been closely observing Edgar for some moments. "The perpetrator's name I have as yet revealed to none-even not to my family, and that it shall not be revealed I promise you here. I do this because I think you an honest and promising youth, whose future I will not be the cause to destroy. Said ten dollars you may bring to me here, into my house, on the first day of each month. You see I have accepted your proposition, and by the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of which I shall be enabled to learn whether I have acted wisely or not." 
                  "And you will bury the secret of my brother's shame in your heart?" 
                  "Upon the fulfillment of your self-imposed conditions." 
                  "You will?" 
                  "I will." 
                  Edgar heard no more. A wild exclamation escaped his thin, blue lips; he fell backward on the floor and fainted away for joy. 
                  A half hour later he was at home, standing, with uncovered head, before the sick couch of Mr. Armhold. 
                  "Father," he said to the paralyzed old man, in a voice both low and full of tenderness, "I have seen the physician, and he has promised to be here soon. In the mean time you are to take the pills he has prescribed for you last night, and which, I fer vently trust, will loosen your tongue ere long, and give you back your speech." 
                  The old man shook his head in sadness and opened his eyes, in the corners of which glistened two big tears. Edgar lowered his head and kissed them off with his thin lips. 
                  "Do not despair, my father," he continued, while over his serene, pale face hung the ethereal sanctities of love and hope-"nay, do not despair. Our sufferings here are but ephemeral, and though we feel them keenly, a silent voice within tells us to be of good cheer, that all things will have an end-and so our sorrows. The day of deliverance will come for all the afflicted-why not also for us? Therefore, O, father, let us not murmur at our fate, but calmly bear up under it, for the silent shades of the departed loved see approvingly down upon the martyred soul, and with joy await its coming, on the threshold of the brighter realm." 
                  As he concluded, two thin and trembling hands were softly laid upon his head. Blind Rebecca, serene and pale as a statue of marble, with her eyes turned heavenward, stood behind her son, breathing a fervent prayer. 
                  "Mother, be of good cheer," he said, a faint, sad smile stealing over his unearthly beautiful and colorless cheeks. "All will yet be well with us. It is my mother who has taught me never to despair, and-I will not. 'Tis true, that we are sorely tried, but as long as we do love one another we have within ourselves the most effectual antidote against the bitterest of grief." 
                  "I can not see you, my son, but I can hear your heavenly voice, and I am happy," said Mrs. Armhold, allowing the palm of her hand to pass over his face. "No, I can not see you, and yet in my mind's eye, your image represents that of an angel of love, giving me a glimpse of paradise." A few minutes later she added: "Will Reuben be here soon?" 
                  "Mother," replied Edgar, "do not feel uneasy about Reuben's absence. Though he may be gone for weeks, believe me, my good mother, he will never cease to think of his parents." 
                  "Edgar, do not deceive your blind mother," she replied, taking hold of his hands-"do not keep anything back from her. Reuben has committed some great crime-has he not? Come, tell me, son; has he not?" 
                  "He has been indiscreet, mother." 
                  Blind Rebecca sadly shook her head, and her wrinkled cheeks began to exhibit a twitching restlessness, as if the suppression of her bitter feelings were spasmotically contracting the muscles. 
                  "Indiscreet?" fell mournfully from her lips. "What has he done, my son?" 
                  "Mother, do not ask me more at present. He has been indiscreet-and who is not at times?-but he is out of danger, and let this console you." 
                  "And has he left us." 
                  "He feared punishment, and hence fled from the city." 
                  "Gone from his old parents!" she sobbed, hiding her head in her apron, while the paralyzed, speechless old man uttered several deep, long and mournful groans. 
                  Anguish was written in every line of his face. 
                  When Edgar, something like a half hour later, entered the office of his employers, he seemed as calm and unmoved as if nothing unusual had occurred to him, and was now depressing his spirit. He opened the safe, took out a large folio ledger, and looked over his own account. "Still twenty dollars in my favor," he lisped to himself, then went at posting his books. 
                  Just then Mr. Preston made his appearance. After he had seated himself, and was reading the morning paper for some time, Edgar laid down the pen and approached him. 
                  "Mr. Preston," he said, lowering his head, "there are twenty dollars still in my favor on last month's wages. Will you permit me to draw the amount now?" 
                  "Certainly." 
                  He took them home to his mother. He gave her that much each month for the support of her family. 
                  But as his monthly salary was forty dollars, let us see how he disposed of the balance. 
                  He kept a diary, in which was written daily what he did and what occurred to him. Let us look into it for a moment, and read over the schedule of his expenses during the months of August and September. 
                  This is for the month of August:  
                         
                           For my mother

                  As can be seen from the above, he always managed to keep his expenses within his income. In August he had saved one dollar and forty cents, and in September three dollars and seventy-five cents. These small surplusses he had reserved toward furnishing himself with clothing and defraying such incidental expenses which, during the year, might be incurred. 
                  When he returned to the office, he found Lionel Harrington waiting for him. 
                  "Mr. Armhold!" said the latter, extending his right hand to Edgar, "I owe you an apology, and hence I do with pleasure retract every word of offence I have made use of last night. I confess to have unjustly accused you of having dealt me the blow that had left this scar on my brow." 
                  Edgar turned somewhat paler, but Lionel did not observe it. 
                  "Mr. Harrington, you owe me no apology, for he who would wrong another, in truth, wrongs but himself. Therefore, forgive yourself-I have naught to forgive." 
                  "But tell me," said Lionel, lighting a cigar, "who in the deuce is that man who resembles you so much, and for whom I have always taken you? Shortly after you had left me last night, and I was still in the hall, a stranger made his appearance, loudly calling on your name. He was bloody, and laboring under the greatest excitement; no sooner had I looked upon his face, however, than I discovered the error under which I till then had labored, for I recognized in the panting young man before me the boy who once had struck me, and for whom I had always taken you. I tell you he seemd a perfect desperado. When I griped him he dashed me to the floor, rushed into the drawing-room, frightened all the ladies with his bloody appearance, and then turning toward the door and finding a policeman at its threshold, ran for the window and leaped through it. Who is he? He was searching for you-was continually calling on your name." 
                  Just then, Newton Preston, Mr. Carlisle and several other gentlemen came into the office and timely interrupted this conversation. They discussed the rumors that had been freely circulated on Pearl and Third streets, namely, that a certain Mr. Montgomery, commission merchant, had been attacked on the night previous by a desperado, who had almost killed him. No one knew who the bold criminal was, and the victim seemed to be as ignorant of it as the police from whom he had made good his escape. 
                  "The same desperado was at our house last night," said Newton, and he recapitulated the whole affair as we have already heard it of Lionel. "He was in search of you, Mr. Armhold," he continued, addressing Edgar, "for he called your name constantly. I thought first the fellow was mad. Do you know him?" 
                  "I have not seen him." 
                  "O, let us drop this discussion," said Carlisle, impatiently. "Let's us talk about something else. I want of each of you two dollars." 
                  "For what?" inquired Lionel. 
                  "For a ticket to a concert. I have a dozen to dispose of; you must help me to get rid of them." 
                  All, save Edgar, took one. 
                  "Won't you purchase a ticket?" said Carlisle, approaching the desk. "The beneficiary ought to be encouraged," and he laid a ticket on the ledger. 
                  "Mr. Carlisle," said Edgar, returning the ticket, "I do not wish a ticket; I hope you will excuse me." 
                  "You don't want it?" 
                  "No, sir." 
                  "Well, sir, you are the most penurious man I have ever met with," said Carlisle, bitterly. "This is the fifth time that you have acted thus. But what can be expected of a fellow who is too stingy to wear a decent coat or boots? In my opinion the most despicable character is a sordid wretch, and you are one of the dirtiest of misers." 
                  "No harsh words now," interfered Newton, who, however, shared the opinion of his companion. 
                  Five minutes later, all, save Edgar, had left the office. A poor woman entered and asked for alms. Our young hero, in threadbare coat and vest, opened his pocket-book; it contained no more than twenty-five cents. He gave them to the poor woman, and in lieu received her blessing. 
                  "Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage," he whispered, and once more he took up his pen. 
                  "A letter for Edgar Armhold!" said a man, approaching the door, and throwing a note on the desk. 
                  "Edgar opened and read it. A pallor spread across his cheeks; his whole form began to shake, and his lips quivered and turned as white as a linen sheet. 
                  What were its contents? 
                
                
                  CHAPTER X.

                              Obtains a richer prize 
                              Than he who, in his coat at rest, 
                              Finds heavenly peace a willing guest, 
                              And bears the promise in his breast 
                              Of treasure in the sky? 
                           
                         
                        MRS. SIGOURNET. 
                      
                   
                  WE believe it was on the subsequent March-early in the evening of a cold and clear day-that Miss Carrie Harrington might have been seen impatiently pacing up and down the sitting-room of her parents' mansion on Clifton avenue. 
                  She was holding a small, gilt-edged volume of Pope's poetry in her hand, into which she, now and then, cast a hasty glance, but without suffering it to rest upon it for a moment at a time. She was evidently thinking over something else. 
                  Now she raised her head, closed up the book, breathed a sigh and looked thoughtfully at the ceiling. 
                  "I can't read; there's no use to try it further," she murmured to herself, and flung the book aside. 
                  She rang the bell; it was loud enough to be heard all over the house. 
                  A servant girl made her appearance. 
                  "Did you ring for me, Miss Carrie?" 
                  "I did. Hasn't Lionel returned yet?" 
                  "No, ma'am." 
                  "Nor mother?" 
                  "She is in the parlor." 
                  "And where is 'pa?" 
                  "In the library, or with mistress, perhaps, for as I came up I heard her address some one. Do you want me to see?" 
                  "No, Clara." 
                  Carrie descended to the parlor. A bright fire was burning in the hearth. It threw a yellow light o'er the darkened room. Upon a low divan of purple velvet reclined a handsome lady of six-and-thirty. She was of middle stature and of beautiful mould. Her skin was fair, her eyes blue, and her hair of a rich auburn. On her cheek blushed the rose, in her eye shone the sky. She was elegantly attired, and gems of great value glittered on her breast and fingers. Close by-upon the same divan-sat a tall gentleman, whose appearance was that of a man who had seen the world in all its phases, tasted of all its pleasures, imbibed some of its errors, and contracted some of its vices. The skin of his face was sallow, his nose was straight and long, and his eyes were small and of a bright gray color. A heavy mustache, turned jet black by the skill of the hair-dyer, covered his thick upper-lip, and curled itself at its extremeties which were turned upward like those of the Chinese. He wore a black cloth coat, bag-fashioned pataloons which were plaid, and a cross-barred vest of white and black. In one hand he held a pair of lavender-tinted kids; in the other-a gold-headed cane of whalebone. He sported a heavy fob chain, and on his ruffled cambric bosom flashed a bright diamond. As Carrie stepped into the room, he rose to his feet, and, inclining his head forward, made his obeisance. 
                  "Carrie," commenced the lady by his side, raising herself up a little, while a silvery laugh broke through her lips, "would you believe that Mr. Netherland-" and here she looked coquettishly into his face, "who has been so good as to accompany me all afternoon from shop to shop and subsequently conducted me home, now insists, in appreciation of his services and high-toned gallantry, upon my going with him to the opera to-night? And this after my assuring him of my indisposition? What shall I do, daughter?-what shall I do?" and once more she fell languishingly back upon her seat. 
                  This was the fashionable Mrs. Mary Harrington-wife of Mr. Hugh Harrington and mother of Carrie and Lionel. 
                  Her biography in brief. 
                  As a girl of fifteen-known then by the name of Miss Mary Clark, and bearing the reputation of being one of the first flirts of the metropolis-she had had the good fortune of making the acquaintance of her present husband, Hugh Harrington-the eldest brother of Mrs. Preston. 
                  At the age of sixteen she had been still more fortunate. She became his wife. 
                  He was then five-and-forty, had a lucrative commission business and was considered one of the most opulent men in the city. 
                  Being in such affluent circumstances he had encountered no difficulties in obtaining the hand of a girl twenty-nine years his junior; and as she had married him for his money and position, she could easily dispense with his love and feel by no means mortified and disappointed at his want of ardor and lack of youthful animation. 
                  A year after their marriage she had given birth to Lionel and three years later Carrie had been ushered into the world. These events had made Mr. Hugh Harrington the happiest man on earth. He had a lovely wife and two equally as lovely children. What more could he have asked for? Had he not also plenty of wealth, and enjoyed he not excellent health, though he counted now nine-and-forty, and over? 
                  He had taken all these things into consideration and was happy. Beside, he was quite a reasonable man, and by no means of a jealous disposition. He knew well enough that young people felt always like young people, and if his wife-his beloved Mary-was constantly full of life, merriment and mischief, was it not natural that she should be so at her age? Hence he allowed her to take many-very many privileges, and such which she assumed without asking, he was always ready to pardon. Then she was a great coquette, had all the wiles of her sex, and knew how to allay suspicion and feed the vanity of her indulgent husband. He was hardly ever at home during the day, but when he did return at dusk she would meet him at the threshold with a bland smile on her face, a fond welcome in her eyes, and accost him with the sweetest of names. She would affectionately wind her arms around his neck and gently play with his gray beard. 
                  She would so long smile and ogle at the poor, susceptible fellow, until he would press her to his heart and pronounce her the best wife in the whole country. 
                  At evenings, after she had kissed him, he would quietly and contentedly repair to his library and while away some hours with reading. In the mean time she would descend to the drawing-room and receive or join there her more particular friends-comprising both ladies and gentlemen, who enjoyed the privilege of calling after tea. At other times she would go to concerts, theaters and operas, and as her husband was not fond of such entertainments, she was necessarily obliged to accept some of the many invitations young gentlemen, who belonged to her train of admirers, continually showered upon her. 
                  Now such a state of affairs might have justly incensed and offended an ordinary husband, but upon the honest, honorable and confiding Hugh Harrington it had no such an effect. In fact, he was really proud of the great attention his lovely wife universally commanded. If any one was bold enough insidiously to refer to her conduct, he invariably took it as a compliment, instead of creating a jealousy in him. He would smile and feel proud, and gratefully remember the names of the gentlemen who constituted her suit. 
                  In this manner twenty years of their married life had been spent, after which she, a handsome woman of six-and-thirty, still retained that life and vigor that chained to her side a host of admirers, while her husband, now five-and-sixty, cared little for any thing but his own comforts, and hence suffered his wife to do pretty much as she pleased. 
                  But on with our story. 
                  "What shall I do?" repeated Mrs. Harrington for the second time, still gazing at her daughter, whose face was thoughtfully turned toward the bright, upward shooting flames in the hearth. 
                  "Indeed, I don't know what to answer you, 'ma. Yet this much I must say, that if I were indisposed I should prefer staying at home to leaving it for an opera or any thing else," replied Carrie, without raising her eyes from the hearth. 
                  "Norma-they play it but once-is one of the finest operas in their repertoire; and its rich music-O, how grand and sublime! who would not rather lose a night's rest than miss it?" exclaimed Mr. Netherland, temptingly looking at the face of Mrs. Harrington. 
                  "Norma is one of my favorites," she murmured to herself. "I have not seen it for years." 
                  "Then see it to-night, madam-see it tonight!" added the wily tempter, somewhat enthusiastically. 
                  "Well, Mr. Netherland, I will neither refuse nor accept your invitation now. Since you are to sup with us, I shall suffer you to exercise your power of speech to persuade me to your desire. If you can change my mind, I shall tell my darling (she always called her husband my 'darling,' and Mr. Netherland 'brute,') not to look for me until midnight." 
                  Persuasion was unnecessary. Mrs. Harrington's mind was evidently made up to go to the opera. A fiendish smile might have been seen hovering in the curves of Netherland's lips. 
                  Carrie had not come down for the purpose of listening to the conversation between her mother and her guest. Something else engrossed her mind. 
                  "'Ma," she said, "I should like to see cousin Hannah. May Lionel take me over to uncle James'?" 
                  "Certainly, daughter." 
                  "And may I stay there till morning?" 
                  "If you so choose." 
                  Now Carrie rattled off a hasty excuse to Mr. Netherland, then turned upon her heels and withdrew. She ascended a flight of stairs, went into her own apartment, rang the bell for her servant, looked for a moment through the window, then into the mirror, paced up and down the floor and hummed a song. 
                  The servant made her appearance. 
                  "Clara, what dress becomes me best?" 
                  Clara was the servant's name. 
                  "I don't know, Miss Carrie; I think you look well in all of them." 
                  "That's not what I asked you." 
                  "Not precisely." 
                  "My Maroon merino-don't you think it becomes me, Clara?" 
                  "Now, I really do like that dress, Miss Carrie. The color is so clear-between a crimson and a claret. And then it fits you so well; I never saw a dress fit nicer." 
                  "Well, get it out for me; also my cloth gaiters." 
                  As the servant was about to withdraw into the adjoining room, Carrie added: 
                  "Come back soon, Clara, for I want you to help me make my toilet." 
                  A half hour later she stood before the mirror, complacently viewing herself in its reflection. She evidently must have been pleased with the inspection, for a smile lighted up her rosy face and danced upon her lips. 
                  "See whether brother Lionel is down stairs," she said to Clara. "Tell him that I want to be taken to uncle's." 
                  As the girl was about to retire, she added: 
                  "Stop! I will run down and see him myself, else he may refuse to go." 
                  So saying she left the room, again humming a song. 
                  "Lionel," she said, as she met her brother in the hall in the act of going away-"Lionel, I want you to take me to uncle's, please." 
                  "I can't do it, Carrie. I am going to the opera to-night." 
                  "Well, can't you go as easy from Avondale as from here?" 
                  "Yes; but I shall go from neither place. I have invited Miss Carlisle, so you see how the matter stands. But I tell you, what I will do. I shall tell John to hitch the horse to the buggy and take you there." 
                  John was Mr. Harrington's-or rather Mrs. Harrington's coachman. 
                  "But 'ma, I think, will want John." 
                  "Why? Is she going out to-night?" 
                  "She is also going to the opera." 
                  "With whom?" 
                  "With Mr. Netherland." 
                  A frown furrowed the brow of Lionel Harrington. 
                  "Carrie," he said, "get ready. John shall take you to uncle's." 
                  "But 'ma-" 
                  "Shall wait till John comes back." 
                  It was dusk already when Carrie descended from her room, crossed the hall, passed through the door, and stepped into the buggy, which had been waiting for her. 
                  We will not follow her now, but turn our steps to a locality where we may find other characters of no less importance to those who have followed the thread of our story. 
                  We are once more across the canal, in the room occupied by the Armhold family. A lighted candle stood on the table, and a bright fire was burning in the hearth. Edgar was seated between his dumb father and blind mother, and little Ruth knelt close by, with her head resting on Mr. Armhold's knee. 
                  The dove of peace seemed at last to have spread out her wings over this abode. A happiness only known to the poor and good, seemed to hover over every face. Sickness had departed, and even want-the gaunt monster-seemed banished from this threshold. Mr. Armhold, though being deprived of the power of speech, had otherwise regained his health. He looked affectionately at his blind wife, who had been more than a ministering angel to him during his long and protracted illness. Night after night she had watched at his bed-side and attended to his wants. It is true she could not see, and he could not speak, but little Ruth could do both, and hence became the tender medium between her kind foster-parents. When Mr. Armhold had left the sick bed he was a changed man both in thought and appearance. During his illness he had learned to study his own character as well as that of his wife. He had seen himself-the monster that he had been. He mentally vowed to atone, as far as possible, for all the wrongs he had done to his true, faithful-ever faithful Rebecca. Only as she stood on the border of the grave, he saw her in her true light, and he wept tears, which fell upon his heart, for the faithful companion whose life he had often embittered. The old love had come back to him, and often would his silent lips kiss the briny tears from her sightless orbs. His eye glistened no longer in anger. Resignation had mellowed their expression and sanctified each glance. A heavenly serenity hovered over his brow, and a faint smile of peace sat on his lips. His hair was as white as the firstborn snow, and fell like silver threads over his shoulders; a long, flowing beard, and of the same hue, covered the greater part of his face, and partly reached to his chest. He had the appearance of a centenarian, and now calmly waited for the hour when he should be gathered to the shades of his fathers. And yet Mr. Armhold had not yet reached his seventieth year. 
                  "'T is even so, my mother," commenced Edgar in a voice both sweet and musical. "Unhappiness is not real; it is but a creation of the mind. There is no station in life in which a mortal being can not be happy." 
                  A tear stood in the corner of Mrs. Armhold's eyes; Edgar saw it, gently took hold of her hand, pressed it in his own, and continued: 
                  "Even you, my mother, and you, my father, afflicted as you are, should learn to be happy. To suffer-to nobly suffer-as both of you have done and still do, carries in itself the ingredients of bliss. O, how sweet are the thoughts that make us conscious of our strength to bear up under the greatest afflictions-that make us conscious of our own superiority over all difficulties! And you, my dearest parents, have shown that strength-evinced that superiority. You must be happy. For it is sweet to suffer silently; to conceal from an unfeeling world our many sorrows; and proudly lock them up in our hearts, until we may throw off this habiliment of dust, and appear before our Judge. Seen by the spirits-those beloved spirits who have preceded us. O, my dearest parents," he continued, his voice growing more tender and mournful, "where on earth is the joy, that can compare with the bliss awaiting us in the other world? Where is it, mother? Where is the tongue to utter or the pen to describe the unalloyed jubilee, when we, after passing through a land of incessant storms-a life embittered in youth, manhood and age-a life of toil, trouble and care-may once more return to those parents who have loved us and watched over our childhood; who have smiled upon us and taught us to lisp their names-may return to them, and lay our heads upon their bosoms and weep ourselves happy? Is this not real ecstacy, to know that the loved ones gone before us can read our motives and see our actions-weep with us and feel for us? Therefore we may smile when the slings and arrows of misfortune pierce deep into our hearts, for we can turn our eyes inward and proudly watch the conflict within which makes us master of ourselves. Why, then, should we mourn and clothe ourselves in sable when the greatest afflictions-the keenest earthly pangs-but shorten our existence here, and that much the sooner throw us into the outstretched arms of a mother and father long since dead, and now waiting for us in the land of purity to take us home and dry our tears?" 
                  Edgar paused for a moment, shook the raven curls over his forehead, and raised those dark, deep and dreamy eyes of his toward the heavens, while a faint, sad smile played upon his features and made them look, in the pale light reflected from the hearth, strangely vague and unearthly beautiful. 
                  "Edgar, my son," whispered his blind mother, bending her eyes, as if they still had the power to see, upon his face over which she now gently suffered her hands to pass-"Edgar, my son, I am happy. Though my eyes are sealed and their light is gone, I still have a glimpse of paradise." 
                  The poor old lady now covered up her face to hide the tears that trickled down the wrinkled cheeks. 
                  Edgar continued: 
                  "Weep not, mother, but smile and be happy." 
                  "I am happy, though I do not smile," she sobbed. 
                   
                  "We have no cause to despond," he said affecting a cheerfulness he was far from feeling. "You know that while I am in good health I can earn all we need, and if I should become sick, the society to which I belong will keep us from want. So cheer up, my mother, and let us strive to make each other happy." 
                  Now he rose from his chair and moved to a desk which stood on the opposite side of the room. Little Ruth had watched him as he crossed the room, and a peculiar expression of childish happiness shone upon her swarthy features. 
                  "Mother," she whispered, "I wish you could see Edgar." 
                  Blind Rebecca wept the more. 
                  Again Mr. Armhold's lips moved, but no articulate sound escaped them. With a look of pity and affection he gazed at his wife, and a tear rolled down his sunken cheeks into his white beard. A moment later, he was seated by her side, pressing her hand in his. 
                  What was Edgar doing at the desk? 
                  He had for sometime been keeping a diary-a journal in which he had been writing down the more important events of his life, and now he was looking over the last page he had indited. 
                  Let us peruse it: 
                  "Wednesday, March 10.-Was sick, but said nothing to my parents. Went to the office, attended to my duties. Paid Life Insurance, $3 50. Bought father 50 cents worth of smoking tobacco; he looked pleased when I gave it to him-it made him happy. Received an anonymous letter-it breathes of nothing save love. I cast it aside-what have I to do with love? I know the handwriting-it is Miss Carrie Harrington's. Came home to supper. Found mother weeping. Wanted to know something about Reuben. I consoled her as well as I could; promised to find out his whereabouts. Where is Reuben? Have not heard anything of him since that fatal night. Is he still alive?-O, I am sad this evening; I should like to weep. Went to Clark's office. He promised to look over my composition. If he only finds it of some merit, I should be so happy. Would write at nights and thereby earn something. Copied letters for Mr. Wilson-he was satisfied and promised me regular employment. It makes me feel easy, for now I shall be better able to attend to my parents' wants. Mr. Preston is still sick; went to his house, as usual, after taking my supper. He seems to be pleased with my labor. Will he give me higher wages? I shall not ask him; shall leave it to his sense of justice. Met Hannah; when I entered the house, she withdrew, hardly bowing to me. She can't bear to look at me. Lionel and Newton were there; both think me a greedy miser and a coward. Hannah entertains the same opinion of me, and consequently despises me. They know not how severely my feelings are wounded by them. Shall they ever know it? No. Came home at nine; wrote one hour, then lay down to sleep." 
                  "Thursday, March, 11.-Went to the office and attended to my duties. Found a letter from Mr. Clark; he accepted my poem; desires me to compose others for him; will pay me two dollars and fifty cents for every one accepted by him. Answered him, complying with his wish. How happy I feel! Can compose four a month. Will net me ten dollars; just the amount I must pay Montgomery. I am happy enough to weep. Never felt happier in my life. As I went home to dinner I met Hannah and Carrie on Fourth-street. Hannah passed me without a sign of recognition. Carrie bowed and smiled. I smiled and bowed in return-I was so happy. Went into a store-bought some calico for little Ruth. Brought it home to her. She is a good little girl. Who is this Ruth? Will we ever know it? Will she ever know it? She deserves to be happy; she is so good to my mother.-Came home to supper. Told my parents of my engagement with Clark. Mother kissed me, and father fondly gazed at me. Peace! peace! peace! Our dwelling is the home of peace. Went to Mr. Preston's; gave him the letters; had quite a conversation with him; Hannah, to my surprise, did not leave the room, but listened to us. When I left, I thought I heard her say 'good night.' Came home; gave a lesson to Ruth. Spoke to my father and mother until they retired. Commenced a new poem-wrote till twelve." 
                  Now he took up the pen and added: 
                  "Friday, March 12.-Found mother sad; I tried to cheer up her spirits. She grieves over the absence of Reuben. Would I could console her! Father had been reading the Bible all day; I have not seen him read the Bible for years.-Met Lionel and Hannah on Fourth-street. They were dressed in cloth and silk. My coat is shabby and old; perhaps when I shall have a finer suit, they will not be ashamed to notice me. Paid seven dollars to the doctor to-day. Will have no money left this month. Can't save one cent. Paid to the Odd-fellows my quarterly fees. Spoke again to mother and father; they are daily growing more reconciled to their fate. Would I knew where Reuben is!-" 
                  Edgar laid down the pen and closed up the journal. He crossed over to his parents, told them that he was going to Mr. Preston's, and would soon be back again. 
                  Little Ruth followed him to the door, with the lighted candle in her hands. 
                   
                  "Will you give me a lesson to-night?" she asked, timidly. 
                  "When I return." 
                  "I shall stay up till you come, and read to 'ma and 'pa," she said. 
                  "That's a good girl." 
                  To be praised by Edgar made her feel happy. When he had descended the stairs, she danced back to the side of Mr. and Mrs. Armhold, her face brightening up with a childish smile. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              A settled virtue 
                              Makes itself a judge; and, satisfied within, 
                              Smiles at that common enemy, the world. 
                           
                         
                        DRYDEN'S RIVAL LADIES. 
                      
                   
                  IT was late when Carrie Harrington arrived before her uncle's house. As soon as the horse halted, she rose, alighted unassisted, told John to drive home and come for her early on the morrow, so she should have time to get ready for Sunday school, which she attended regularly. She had a class of pupils-something like twenty girls and boys-which Rev. Longfinger had assigned to her for the purpose of teaching them the first principles of Christianity. But as we are at present not at Sunday school, but in front of Mr. Preston's dwelling, we will give our attention to what occurred in our presence, and leave the other for subsequent considerations. 
                  "I thought I was to wait for you, Miss Harrington," said the coachman, to whom, in fact, she had given such orders when she started away from home. 
                  "Yes, but I have changed my mind," she replied hastily, turned around, opened the front gate, tripped lightly over the snow, ran up the few marble stiles, rang the bell, was admitted, and a few minutes later, (having in the hall been relieved of that part of her attire which she had thrown over her body before she had left home in order to shield herself from the cold), was snugly seated by her cousin Hannah, in the latter's private apartment. 
                  Hannah was evidently out of humor. It could be observed in her abrupt speaking and keen retorts; her looks also betrayed it. A shade was cast over all her features. It was not one of sadness or melancholy; no, it rather expressed displeasure-a dissatisfaction, that made her look cold and inanimate, but not mean and bitter. It excluded the ray of mildness from her eyes, but still did not make them seem harsh. But to look at her was to know that she was not in a pleasant mood. 
                  "What's the matter with you, Hannah?" inquired Carrie, after a minute's conversation with her cousin. "You don't seem in the best humor imaginable. You don't laugh; you pout, and look cross; indeed, you do. You have little to say, and that I must almost force out of you. Come, tell me-what is the matter with you?" 
                  Carrie kneeled down by the side of her cousin, whose hands she now placed in her own, and commenced see-sawing with her arms. 
                  "Come, tell me what's the matter with you?" she repeated, mischievously laughing. "I'll tear your arms out, if you don't." 
                  "I don't know myself, Carrie. Indeed, I don't," replied Hannah. "I sometimes do feel sad without knowing why. And now, for several hours, I have been feeling that way, having no more cause for it than you have, I presume, for being so lively," and a faint smile ventured to peep through the transparency of her cheeks. 
                  "Indeed!" rejoined Carrie, gracefully nodding her head, and coquettishly blinking her eyes; "indeed! I should regret to know that you have half as much cause for sadness as I have for being pleased." 
                  "And what is it that causes you such delight?" said Hannah, somewhat more enlivened. 
                  "Can't you guess?" said Carrie, looking her companion full in the face, and exhibiting a row of laughing teeth. 
                  "No." 
                  "You can't?" 
                  "No. Don't pull my arms so-don't." 
                  Carrie having braced herself backward as far as the elasticity of her body permitted, was see-sawing Hannah's arms almost out of their joints. When the latter burst out in a short exclamation of pain, Carrie commenced laughing, and continued-if any thing, with more force-in her sport. 
                  "Won't you smile at me if I tell you why I'm pleased?" she exclaimed, in a soft tone. "Won't you?" 
                  "No." 
                  "You won't?" 
                  "O, don't be so foolish." 
                  Carrie released her hold, bounded up from the floor like an elastic ball, placed her ruddy lips before her cousin's left ear, and exclaimed-not whispered-"I shall see Edgar! Edgar! Edgar!" then whirled herself around, joyfully clapping her little white hands together, and commenced to dance around the room. 
                  "Carrie, you are crazy." 
                  "No, I am not." 
                  "But I tell you, you are." 
                  "But I tell you I am not," and she still tripped fantastically over the floor. 
                  "You make yourself ridiculous over this Edgar Armhold, who, after all, cares not a snap of his finger for you." 
                  This unvarnished remark checked Carrie in her career of dancing, and at once rooted her to the floor in the center of the room. 
                  "Hannah! how do you know that?" she said, abruptly, her cheeks turning from scarlet to white. "Has he ever told you so?" 
                  "No; but I have seen sufficient of him to warrant the assertion that he cares nothing for you. Why, you, yourself, have repeatedly told me that he has never called on you, though you have been silly enough to tender him more invitations than he should have received of me had he been the first in the land, and I ever so much smitten with him. Believe me, Carrie, if he cared any thing for you, he would not be slow in showing it to you." 
                  Carrie lowered her head over her bosom and remained silent. She had heard an unpleasant truth, and she became crestfallen. Could one have looked into her heart then, he might have seen the early struggle of disappointed love. 
                  "But this should not grieve you, Carrie," continued her cousin in a soft strain, yet with the coolness and deliberation of a person desirous of leaving an impression upon an abused mind. "Nay, this should not grieve you. Edgar Armhold is not your equal; he is beneath you in every respect. Who and what is he? A low and miserable Jew-" 
                  "Hannah-" 
                  "A man who is too stingy to get himself a decent suit of clothes. Have you never taken notice of his threadbare coat, his shabby pants, and worn-out vest? Have you never observed his boots-patch after patch? Most assuredly you have. But you tell me he has a handsome face; that you admire his eyes and hair; that you even love to listen to his voice. Now, come, Carrie! I will admit that he is not the ugliest of all men, but he is by no means the only handsome man I have ever seen, while his character is unquestionably so low, that a lady who professes to possess some refinement stoops in thinking about him." 
                  "O, he is not quite so low as that," remonstrated Carrie, raising her sad eyes reproachfully toward her cousin's calm face, then sitting down and looking mechanically at the fire in the hearth. 
                  "But he is, Carrie. You only do not see it. They say Love is blind, and I begin to believe it. Edgar Armhold, as Lionel and Newton have often told us, is more than penurious; he hoards up his money like an old miser. Tell me, what can be more despicable than such a character? Why, Carrie, I despise littleness. I want a man to be a man. Now, I could more easily love the worst rowdy in the city than such as he. For a rowdy has courage, at least, and will fight when he is offended. He won't suffer others to insult him without an effort to avenge himself. But Edgar Armhold is a coward-a sneaking coward-in the full sense of the term. A man whom nothing offends is devoid of honor and self-respect. Such a man is Edgar Armhold. Therefore, I scarcely show him my face; and yet, whenever he sees me, he pulls off his hat and makes his obeisance. To-day Lionel and I met him on Fourth-street. He had the audacity to smile in my face, but I passed without noticing him. Jews in general are void of character; but I believe there are few who would have stood as many insults as I have already heaped upon that man." 
                  Hannah said no more. She thought she had said enough to convince Carrie of Edgar's unworthiness of her (Carrie's) love. But she was mistaken. To abuse those we love is like throwing fresh fuel on the flame, and makes us cling to them the more. It was so with Carrie. 
                  "Well, I can't see what praise you deserve for having abused a gentleman who has never harmed you, or what he has forfeited in having quietly borne your insults," replied Carrie, considerably piqued at the merciless onslaught on her lover's character. "And as to his being a Jew," she continued, sharply, "what do I care for his religion? I don't know why a Jew shouldn't be as good as a Christian. I presume all good men are alike pleasing in the sight of God; if not, they ought to be, and that's the same. As for Edgar Armhold-you know I have no secrets from you-I don't look upon him in the same light as you do. You say, for instance, he is penurious. How do you know that he is so? Because Lionel and Newton said so? They don't like him-at least Lionel don't; you know that well enough. They have at times called on him for money, and he has often refused to give them any. Was he compelled to comply with their request? No; by no means. I should've done just as she did, had I thought proper. And more: I know Mr. Armhold to be a poor young man. I know this to be a fact, for I remember it once escaped his lips, though I believe he regretted the betrayal; at least, I should think so, for in no subsequent conversation did he ever allude again to his condition in life. I didn't think him at all low or bad, Hannah. No, indeed. I believe him as good as he is handsome; and isn't he handsome?" 
                  Here she proudly raised her head, riveted her eyes upon Hannah, and smiled. 
                  "I didn't say he was ugly; and perhaps I might have thought him beautiful, had I-now this mustn't offend you-had I not found so great a contrast between the features of his face and those of his character," replied Hannah, her voice somewhat more modified. 
                  "To tell you the truth, Miss Preston, I don't want you to think him beautiful. It would make me jealous; and you know what I told you on the eve of your last birthday celebration. I told you then I should go mad to be supplanted in a lover's heart-and I should," she added, significantly, nodding her head, to show her cousin that she was serious in this declaration. "I love this Edgar Armhold; and more than that, he shall love me in return." 
                   
                  There was a strange gleaming in her eyes. It came from her soul, and lighted up her face. 
                  "Rest at ease, Carrie; you shall never find a rival in me. The man that I love must be bold, daring, proud, and liberal to a fault. Edgar Armhold-pardon me for saying it-as far as I know him, is sneaking, cowardly, characterless, and penurious. I hate him"-and she rose from her seat, and walked up and down the whole length of her chamber. 
                  Carrie kept her eyes upon her cousin's graceful figure for some time; then, also rising to her feet, she approached her, and, looking her fully in the face, said: 
                  "Hate him, if you will, Hannah; but, I pray you, cease to abuse him in my presence. I love this man! Every word you speak against him, believe me, cousin, wounds my feelings and makes my heart bleed. Any thing ill said of him depresses my spirit. 'Tis even so, Hannah; I can not help it." 
                  "Carrie, you know that I love you, and therefore would not say any thing to wound your feelings, unless by so doing I hoped to be able to serve you. It is the duty of a friend to be candid, even at the risk of displeasing. Carrie, you are marching toward the brink of an abyss, and you do not know it. Soon it will be too late to turn back. The gulf is now yawning beneath your feet. A few steps more, and you are beyond redemption." 
                  Carrie Harrington had gradually lowered her head until it mechanically rested upon her heaving bosom. 
                  "We are by ourselves, cousin; no one can listen to what we say," continued Hannah, taking the other's hand, and leading her back to the sofa. "Why should we not speak freely to each other? I know you love this Edgar Armhold. You are constantly thinking of him; you seem to live and breathe in him. What will eventually be the consequence of all this? Tell me, Carrie; I shudder to think of it. I have with uneasiness watched the growth of your passion, and now I feel the greatest apprehension for you." 
                  Carrie raised her head, and exhibited to her cousin a face of marble. 
                  "Nay, do not start," continued the latter, "but listen to one who loves you, and would fain save you from the impending peril. Take my advice, though I am a girl no older than yourself. Leave off thinking of this young man; bestow your affections upon some nobler being. He is not worth a thought of yours. O, Carrie! Carrie! shun his presence-at least until you have learned to forget him. Remember, it involves your happiness and your future existence. Reflect a moment. Would you unite yourself to a Jew? Nay, I know you would not. And such a low and sneaking Jew! Believe me, you are blind to his imperfections. He is devoid of honor and manly principles, and therefore can never command any one's respect. Lionel once called him a coward, but it had not the effect to even raise his anger, leave alone a desire to avenge the insult. Newton has frequently ridiculed his shabby attire, and told him to be ashamed of it; he was too stingy to purchase a new suit, but, instead, had a tailor to turn his coat. Besides this miserly disposition, father suspects him of opening his letters, and therefore intends to discharge him." 
                  Hannah stopped, and a pause of several moments ensued in which both seemed lost in reflection. Carrie was the first to break the silence. 
                  "Hannah," she said, calmly-almost solemnly, "convince me of Edgar's debased nature, and I promise you to learn to forget the attachment that now binds me to him." 
                  "Will you give me one week's time?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Very well. If I do not establish his baseness, I shall then acknowledge to having wronged him, and will, if desired by you, exert my influence in your behalf." 
                  "Do you promise this?" joyfully exclaimed Carrie. 
                  "I do." 
                  "Edgar can stand the test!" 
                  "Never!-Let us now go down stairs." 
                  The two maidens rose to their feet, extinguished the light, and a few minutes later entered the room of Mr. Preston. 
                  To their great surprise, they found it deserted by all save a pale-faced youth-Edgar Armhold. He was seated on the chair near the door, and looking through the window at the yellow moon without. No sooner was he apprised of their presence than he rose to his feet, respectfully inclined his head, and whispered "Good evening." 
                  Carrie's cheeks were scarlet, but Hannah's turned, if any thing, whiter and colder than they had been." 
                  "We thought to find my father here," said she, in a freezing tone, still holding the knob of the door in her hand, as if she had not yet determined whether to come in or to withdraw. 
                  "Your father, Miss Preston, is in the library. He will be here in a few minutes." 
                  There was a sad, mournful vein running through all his words. It displeased Hannah, for she thought it the wile of a hypocrite; but it charmed Carrie. 
                  The cousins now lightly stepped across the room, and sat down by each other on a sofa. 
                  "It is cold out of doors, is it not?" inquired Hannah of Edgar. 
                  "It is, Miss Preston." 
                  "Indeed, you can not think so." 
                  "May I ask you why?" 
                  "Because I find you attired in a coat better suited for August than March," she said, sarcastically, curling her thin lips, and contemptuously temptuously gazing at his thin coat, which, however, was cleanly brushed, and beautifully fitted his graceful figure. 
                  He understood the biting sarcasm. 
                  "The coat is somewhat light," he said, raising his dreamy eyes toward her face, as if pleading in behalf of his wounded feelings. 
                  "Nevertheless you are consistent in your attire," she continued, in the same ironical strain. "The coat corresponds to your pants, and both to the vest. Yes, this displays a full share of taste without the least show of vanity,"-than abruptly added: "You don't seem to be extravagant in the outlay for your wardrobe?" 
                  "No, ma'am," he replied, in a voice but little louder than a whisper, lowering his head over his breast. 
                  "Well, Mr. Armhold, do you not love to see men liberal? I despise the miserly." 
                  "We should all be liberal," he said, significantly; "and the greatest liberality is that, Miss Preston, which deposits its love and sympathy in hearts from which adversity daily draws a treasure of tears." 
                  Hannah did not understand him; prejudice had blinded her, else she would have admired what she now hated in him. She was naturally lofty, and expected every one to be the same. She thought Edgar low and niggardly; thought him to be something like a servile slave, whom nothing could offend. Besides this-he was a Jew. This was enough to make her look down upon him with contempt. From infancy she had never heard the name of "Jew" coupled with anything honorable. He was more a subject of contempt than hatred; hence she looked down on him. 
                  "Mr. Armhold, I have a favor to ask of you," she said, with that freedom and want of reserve shown by the young to those whom they think their inferiors. 
                  "If in my power, I shall be pleased to grant it," he replied. 
                  "It is in your power, else I should not ask it. I am collecting some money for a poor widow lady, who, with her three children, is entirely depending on the charity of the world for her living. I trust you will favor her with a donation." 
                  Hannah Preston was haughty as a queen, but as generous as the most generous soul. The poor blessed her, and called her their benefactress. On this day she had become acquainted, by chance, with a widow, in whose face was written "want." She soon learned her circumstances, and promised to ameliorate them. Hence, her appeal to Edgar was not invented solely for this occasion, though it served two purposes-namely: if generously responded to, the widow would be benefited; if not, Edgar's character would be shown up in its true colors in the presence of Carrie Harrington, who, strange as it may appear, had, as yet, not uttered a single syllable. 
                  No sooner had Hannah ceased speaking, than Edgar began to exhibit some embarrassment, and a faint red stole over his cheeks. He placed his hand in his vest-pocket where he kept his money. At the present moment it contained twenty-five cents. It was all he had. During the day-as we have seen him write down in his diary-he had paid the doctor's bill and his quarterly fees to the Odd-fellows. Twenty-five cents is a small sum, but when it is one's all, it leaves him poorer in giving it away than it would the rich man in giving thousands. 
                  "Please accept this," Edgar said, placing his all in Hannah's hand. 
                  He would have uttered an excuse for not giving more; but he could not well do it without speaking of his own destitution, to which he did not choose to refer. 
                  "A quarter of a dollar!" she exclaimed, sarcastically, her glistening eyes contempuously looking down upon him. "A quarter of a dollar! Wondrous generosity! Here!" and she threw the silver coin in his face, turned haughtily away, and, like an angry leopardess, receded from the room. 
                  Edgar, pale as a corpse, stooped down, picket up the coin, and returned it to his vest-pocket. 
                  "Mr. Armhold-" said a gentle voice close by. 
                  He looked around, and saw Miss Carrie Harrington standing by his side. Her cheeks were paler than usual, and her eyes were red. She had been weeping. 
                  "Miss Harrington-" 
                  He had no time to say more. Mr. Preston had opened the door of the library. No sooner did Carrie espy him than she ran to meet him, conducted him to his chair, inquired after his health, and asked him a hundred other questions, which being answered by her uncle, she eventually withdrew, but not before bowing to Mr. Armhold and wishing him a good-night. 
                  Edgar remained with Mr. Preston something like a half hour, after which he went back to his house, gave the promised lesson to Ruth, entertained his parents till ten, then seated himself at his desk, opened his journal, and added the following: 
                  "Just come from Mr. Preston. Met Hannah and Carrie. Was asked by the former for a contribution. I offered all the money I had. It was a quarter-I had no more. She threw it contemptuously into my face, and left the room in anger. She thinks me a miser. My heart bleeds; I could weep." 
                  It was twelve when Edgar went to bed. On the following morning he started early for the office. The porter met him at the door and handed him a note. 
                  The contents ran as follows: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "MR. ARMHOLD: I take this means to inform form you that your services are no longer needed at my establishment. My son Newton is instructed to pay you the balance still in your favor. 
                              
                                 Respectfully, 
                                 "JAMES PRESTON."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Edgar did not wait for the arrival of Newton, but sadly left the office, not knowing whither to turn his steps. 
                  On the same morning, Hannah wore a bitter smile upon her face. She had, on the previous evening, begged her father to discharge Edgar Armhold from his services and, to please her, he had done so. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Alas! the breast that inly bleeds, 
                              Has naught to fear from outward blow: 
                              Who falls from all he knows of bliss, 
                              Cares little into what abyss. 
                           
                         
                        BYRON'S GIAOUR. 
                      
                   
                  AS we have seen in the preceding chapter, Edgar Armhold, through the instigation of Miss Hannah Preston, had been summarily discharged from the situation he had held in her father's establishment. Yet, with this fact boldly staring in our face, it would be wrong totally to condemn Hannah of a want of feeling and hard-heartedness, just because we have found her in this instance to exhibit a disposition which would partly warrant such a conclusion. We can not judge one's character from action only. It is the motive, or still more definitely speaking, it is the cause that fathers the motive, that should and must be known, before we ought to venture on lauding or condemning mere actions. A blow is a blow, and an error is an error; yet we will pardon them in one, while we will censure the same in another. Hence, it is always necessary to suspend our judgment, at least, until, by virtue of investigation and deliberation, we are qualified and entitled to form one. 
                  Had Miss Hannah Preston been an ordinary person, whose standard of excellence was formed by associations with the vulgar, or whose heart was debased, morals corrupted, and mind benighted, it is quite probable that she would have looked upon Edgar Armhold with less contempt, and dealt with him more generously. But as those who stand on the highest peak of a promontory will find the objects at its feet small and insignificant, so will those who look down from the sky-reaching pinnacles of purity and moral greatness, judge those in the abyss of error in proportion to the distance that separates them. 
                  Hannah Preston was yet in her pristine purity. Not a stain was on her character; and yet she had one fault. It was a great fault. Let us attribute it to her youth, her inexperience, and to her reading sentimental novels. 
                  What was that fault? 
                  To her there was no medium between right and wrong. 
                  She had read of beings who were either pure as angels or black as demons. 
                  And she believed what she had read. Hence the discovery of a single defect in a character confirmed, in her opinion, its total depravity. It was either without a solitary vice or without a single virtue-either as fair as day or as dark as night. She only knew of two classes; one to be praised and loved, the other to be censured and despised. 
                  She had placed Edgar in the latter category. 
                  'Tis true, when she had seen him at the soiree, his handsome face and dreamy eyes had almost fascinated her. For a moment she had thought to see through them all the virtues of the human race. But no sooner had she been informed that he was her father's book-keeper, and a Jew, whom both Lionel and her brother had described as a penurious, cowardly and unprincipled individual, than she ceased to find beauty in his features, and looked upon him with disgust; for, with the faith and simplicity of the innocent, she had not doubted the correctness of her information, and hence believed his utter debasement. 
                  Is it then a wonder that she felt very uneasy and unhappy when she discovered the attachment of her cousin Carrie, whom she ardently loved, toward a being whom she despised with the whole strength of her nature? Is it then a wonder that, after having convinced herself of his illiberality, she should feel a still greater aversion toward him, and, therefore, leave no means undone to remove as far, and as soon as possible, the object whose very presence endangered the future happiness of Carrie? Is it then a wonder that she should have pleaded for the dismissal of a man whose presence and position she thought dangerous, not only to her cousin, but also to her father, who had of late suspected him of tampering with his private letters and papers? 
                  No-decidedly, no. 
                  Hannah Preston was honest, in the strictest sense of the word, and acted from the purest motives. She thought she had done her duty, and therefore felt pleased when she heard that she had not pleaded in vain, and Edgar Armhold was no longer in her father's service. Yet one thing she could not understand. Edgar had left-so Newton told her-even without asking for the wages due him. It puzzled her for a moment, but soon she arrived at the conclusion, that since he had been engaged by the month, he would wait until the first of April, and claim full pay. As this idea flashed across her mind, she smiled. She had promised Carrie proof of his littleness, and was she not gathering plenty of it? 
                  As we have read in the last chapter, Edgar was dismissed from service on Saturday morning, the 13th of March. It was on the following Tuesday evening-between the hours of three and four-when Hannah, who in company with Lionel Harrington, was out promenading, saw him hastening down Fourth-street. She thought his cheeks were somewhat thinner and paler, and his eyes a shade or two darker-as if buried deeper in their sockets. 'Tis true she had cast but a single glance at him, and this before he had seen her, but still she discovered a change in the whole expression of his countenance, in which she read utter degradation instead of grief and humility. He held his left hand tightly to the wing of his thin, black cloth coat. There was something concealed under it. What it was could not be seen. It might have been a large bundle of goods, or a lot of books that protruded from under the skirt. Hannah observed this, and a strange thought flashed across her mind. Her thin lips curled disdainfully, and something like a smile of triumph passed momentarily over her cheeks. 
                  "Do people steal sometimes in broad daylight?" she asked of Lionel, abruptly. 
                  "What a question! To be sure they do. Why not? Is not one hour just as good as another?" 
                  She had no time to reply. Edgar Armhold was only a few paces from them. He recognized them, pulled off his hat with his right hand, respectfully inclined his head a little, and passed on. Hannah's cheeks grew pallid. Her lips began to tremble. She had been insulted-publicly insulted-and an angry glance flashed from her blue eyes. 
                  He had made a sign of recognition! 
                  Edgar Armhold, the miserly Jew! 
                  "Lionel!" she said, abruptly, almost coming to a stand-still, "this impertinent fellow-" she put a great deal of stress on 'fellow'-"has insulted me again. He bowed to me as he passed. He has frequently done so. I'm sure he is aware that I don't want to know him. I wish you'd go back and give him a piece of your mind. The impertinent fellow!" 
                  "Of whom do you speak-do you complain?" inquired Lionel astonished. 
                  "Of whom do I speak? Of whom do I speak? Of whom should I speak but of Edgar Armhold?" 
                  "Edgar Armhold? Where is he?" 
                  "Why, he has just passed us? Didn't you see him?" 
                  "No;" and turning round he added: "Hannah, walk slowly, I'll catch up with you in a moment." 
                  So saying, he parted from his fair companion, and followed in the wake of our young hero, with whom he soon caught up. 
                  "Say, Armhold!" he commenced, shaking Edgar roughly by the arm, "I want you to cease your impertinence, or I shall be compelled to teach you a lesson. I don't want you to recognize or salute Miss Preston on the street or elsewhere. She don't want to know you. Do you hear that?" and once more he shook Edgar's arm, when, unfortunately, the latter dropped on the slushy pavement before him, the things he had held concealed under his coat. 
                  Two books! 
                  Buckle's History of Civilization, and Schlegel's Philosophy of the Mind. 
                  They had fallen in the mud, and their pages were more or less soiled. 
                  Edgar looked down upon them, and shook his head in sadness. 
                  "Do you hear that?" repeated Lionel, threateningly, at the same time placing one of his feet on "Buckle's History of Civilization." 
                  This was said loud enough to be heard at a distance of ten paces and more; but Edgar, to whom it was addressed, might have been deaf for all the impression it left upon his mind. 
                  His eyes were all the time riveted to the ground-riveted on the book that had been concealed under his coat and which was now feeling the pressure of Lionel's foot. Could any one have looked into Edgar's face at that moment, he might have seen and read in its calm, fixed and immovable lines that peculiar look, which, in its want of expression, reminds one of a pale and sickly candle-light, or of a faint shadow of midnight seen through the color of morn. It was not despair-it seemed rather a passion that was deprived of its intensity and violence without having lost that depression which utterly stupefies and benumbs the senses, that could be traced in every lineament of his face. It was equanimity seen through the light of extinguished hopes. It was exhaustion seen through the mirror of receded misery. Soon, however, it changed into an expression of indescribable sadness, and, as he raised his head, a bright tear might have been seen lingering in his mysterious black eyes. A sigh escaped his breast-unconsciously, it seemed-for a close observer might have noticed in his manner of drawing his lips together that he endeavored-as it were-to check the breath that had already betrayed his feelings. He gazed for a moment at Lionel, who had contemptuously kept his eyes upon him, then stooped down and picked up the books now completely soiled, and, after hiding them once more under his coat, and without uttering a single word, turned around and hastily moved through the crowd of loafers and lazy damsels who were exhibiting-the former their colored moustaches and the latter their painted cheeks and counterfeit curls: the ambition of the nineteenth century-on Fourth-street. 
                  Whither was he hurrying with these books? 
                  To the pawnbroker's. 
                  This was Tuesday; it was on the Saturday day previous that he had been discharged from his situation. 
                  Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday-what had he been doing during this time? 
                  Let us go back and see. 
                  We remember having seen him leave the establishment of Mr. Preston, immediately after he had read the letter the porter had placed in his hands. With its contents we are already acquainted. 
                  For upward of an hour he walked up and down the several business squares nearest the river, absorbed in thought, neither observed nor observing. He was reflecting over the unpleasant situation in which he found himself. Never had anything so taken him by surprise as this dismissal. He could not account for it. Mr. Preston had always given him assurances of his good will, and now that very Mr. Preston turned his face against him, and without assigning a reason whatsoever, discharged him, and that, too, before the expiration of the month. Could he have been informed of Reuben's conduct? No. Mr. Montgomery had pledged to keep the whole affair a secret under certain stipulations, and, as these had not been violated, Edgar felt confident of his secrecy. Hence he banished this thought. 
                  Though still perplexed, he had ceased to worry his brain as to the cause, and at once commenced to reflect over the probable effect of this affair on his immediate future. A shade passed over his brow, and it became very thoughtful. No sigh escaped from his lips; no tears could be seen in his eyes. It had been a habit of his always to hold his head and body erect like a straight, young pine; now he stooped a little, and his eyes mechanically rested on the pavement. When you deal a heavy blow on some one's temple, he will totter and fall, and when you take from a man his last hope and thrust him forth, you will truly confound him, and, for some time, deprive him of his reason. 
                  Edgar experienced this benumbing sensation. He felt as if a heavy weight had pressed him down to the ground, from which no one would help him to rise. He looked up-hundreds passed him, but none could read his features. No one understood the mute language of his bleeding heart. Physiogomy is a science this civilized age has neglected to study. 
                  A dull-a cold, icy chill crept through his frame. 
                  Only nineteen years old, and Edgar had already lost his faith in man! 
                  To know mankind is to know selfishness. From the selfishness of mankind the millions starve and the few are pampered. Edgar believed himself to belong to these millions. 
                  A father to support- 
                  A mother to support- 
                  Ruth to support- 
                  Wherewith? 
                  We have said that a chill crept through his frame. It had the effect of the heavy frost on early blossoms. It deprived him of the vivifying spirit. It congealed his blood and his marrow. 
                  Though partly a philosopher, he was still a young man, and young men see through magnifying glasses. They know of no medium. With them it is either hope or despair. 
                  To Edgar everything looked dark. He had already jumped, as it were, into the future, which was to him a perpetual midnight-a midnight not to be followed by a dawn. 
                  He had trembled at the approach of danger; but now being overtaken by it, it made a hero of him. 
                  He determined to keep his dismissal a secret from his parents; they, at least, should not share with him that sorrow. He would only acquaint them with it after he had obtained another situation. With this resolution he now retraced his steps. It was nearly ten o'clock when he reached Pearl-street. He went from house to house soliciting employment. He was willing to take any situation that should be offered him; either as book-keeper, entry clerk, or salesman. He found not a single vacancy. At twelve o'clock he offered his services as porter; but lacked the essential qualifications-broad shoulders, muscles, arms and big hands-and therefore was declared unfit. So he buttoned up his thin coat and went home, and ate his dinner in company with his parents and little Ruth. He was unusually merry and communicative; the smile deceived his father, and the laugh deceived his mother, and he felt happy in the success of this innocent deception. In the afternoon, he called on Mr. Clark, the publisher, and on Mr. Wilson. Mr. Clark told him that he desired of him no more than one poem a week, and Mr. Wilson informed him that he had at present nothing for him to copy. Sadly and sorrowfully he left the latter's threshold. He went through Third, Fourth and Fifth streets, but with no better success than he had had in the morning. At four in the evening he still had found no employment. Then his equanimity began to forsake him. No income save ten dollars per month of Mr. Clark, for his poems, and this amount he had set aside to liquidate his brother's debt! With what now should he pays his rent and support his parents? 
                  At such a juncture of affairs the honest man becomes a rogue and a thief. The penitentiaries are full of these; the palaces with those who made them so. We never ask why men fall; we only ask, "Have they fallen?" and being answered in the affirmative, we give them a kick, and flatter ourselves that we have done society a great service. 
                  What a benevolent and civilized world! 
                  But Edgar did not fall. Again he tried. 
                      
                        HANNAH PRESTON AND CARRIE HARRINGTON. 
                     
                     
                      He went into a small establishment on Walnut street. 
                  A vacancy! a vacancy! 
                  Who was happier than he? 
                  The welcome information almost stunned him; but soon his young heart began to leap for joy. There were no tears in his eyes, but they seemed to have softened and melted away. He could and, perhaps, would have wept, if he had had the strength to do so, but he hadn't it. There are times in a man's life, when he allows all his energy to ebb away, and suffers a soothing indifference to unstring the nerves that had braced him up. 
                  "Will you try me, sir?" said Edgar. 
                  "Come to my establishment on the 1st day of May." 
                  "Can't you employ me now?" 
                  "No." 
                  No! Like a death knell that monosyllable fell upon his ears. It was now the 16th of March, and he was to wait until the 1st of May. An interim of nearly seven weeks. This seemed an age to Edgar. 
                  His surplus money had been spent for fuel: how was he to defray his expenses in the mean time? 
                  "I will work for you on your own terms until the 1st of May," he said to the gentleman who had promised him employment. "Yes," he continued, exhibiting an anxiety and a poorly concealed eagerness, "I will work for you until then at half price, if you so desire it. All I ask is employment; I pray you, give it to me." 
                  The merchant looked with suspicion on our young hero. He considered his eagerness an unfavorable sign. More. He was a practicable man. He would never engage any one whose service could be had for almost any price. 
                  "I presume you would stay at my establishment for a trifle?" he inquired, glancing sideways at Edgar. "For twenty dollars per month?" 
                  "Yes; yes, sir;" and he advanced a few paces. "Yes, sir. Shall I come in the morning?" 
                  "Are you a good book-keeper?" 
                  "I believe I can keep accounts correctly." 
                  "You can, and would take twenty dollars per month?" 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "Well, young man, you can seek employment elsewhere. I woudn't have your services for a gift;" and he turned around and walked off. 
                  Edgar would have sunk to the ground had he not leaned against the counter, behind which a half dozen starched-up counter-hoppers were simpering and leisurely walking up and down the length of the store. 
                  He went home with a bleeding heart and a smiling face. He was merrier than ever. He spoke much and kindly to his father, and listened attentively to his mother. He gave to little Ruth her lessons, as usual. When all had gone to bed, he seated himself by the desk and consigned his thoughts to his journal; after which he looked into his heart and poured his whole soul into poetry. This poetry was to bring two dollars and fifty cents at the end of the week. 
                  On Monday morning he went again to Mr. Wilson, who gave him some manuscript to copy. Edgar begged to be permitted to copy it there, which was granted. He then hurried home to tell his parents not to expect him back before evening. 
                  At six in the evening Mr. Wilson handed him one dollar and fifty cents, and informed him that he had nothing else for him to do for the present. 
                  Edgar went home, and wore a smile on his face. He had determined to keep his sorrows from his parents, and he succeeded in his purpose. 
                  On the following morning his mother reminded him that it was rent-day. What should he do to satisfy his landlord? All the money he had in his possession was what he had received on the previous evening of Mr. Wilson. One dollar and fifty cents! And his rent amounted to seven dollars! 
                  Five dollars and fifty cents short. A trifle to some-a fortune to Edgar. 
                  A happy thought flashed across his mind, and he smiled. 
                  "Mother," he said, "if the landlord should come during my absence, please tell him that I will bring him the rent by noon." 
                  He went to his desk, selected some books, placed them under his arm, and departed. 
                  Shakspeare, Byron, Milton, Hegel, and Hugh Miller's Testimony of the Rocks! 
                  He took them to the pawnbroker's. The pawnbroker was the only man who read his features correctly. It was part of his profession to study features. He had made his fortune by understanding the science of physiognomy. 
                  "I can't loan you over three dollars on them," he said, indifferently, to Edgar. 
                  They had cost nearly five times that amount, and were still as good as new. 
                  "No more?" inquired Edgar, his pale face exhibiting that peculiar expression arising from hidden cares and bitter disappointments. 
                  "No more." 
                  "Let me have the three dollars, then." 
                  He went straight to his landlord, and offered to pay him four dollars and fifty cents on account. 
                  Nothing less than seven dollars would do. If not paid by night, he would have Edgar's family ejected on the following morning. 
                  Edgar was unacquainted with the law; he believed the landlord had that right, and therefore he trembled. 
                  "I shall pay you in full by night," he said, almost inaudibly; and, with another tear-drop falling on his heart, he left the house. 
                   
                  Again he sought for employment, but found none. At two o'clock he met a friend, and asked him for a loan of two dollars and fifty cents. The friend couldn't serve him with the sum, but offered him a highlyflavored cigar. Edgar declined, and slowly walked home. 
                  Again he went to his book-case. This time he drew forth Buckle's History of Civilization and Schlegel's Philosophy of the Mind. They were his two best-kept books; his whole hope was centered in them. These were the books he had had concealed under his coat when Hannah and Lionel met him on Fourth-street. 
                  Reader, can you understand now, why Edgar had looked like a statue of despair when Lionel caused those books to fall in the slush? Can you understand now, why he had riveted his eyes on the ground where Lionel had crushed under foot Edgar's very last hope of raising money to pay his rent? 
                  But now we must return again to Miss Hannah Preston, to whom her cousin, being again by her side, related how he had served the impertinent Edgar Armhold. 
                  "And you think it probable that he has stolen these books?" she inquired. 
                  "Why not? It is hard to tell what crimes a Jew would not commit." 
                  Lionel-in justice to him be it remarked-said this without the least malice against Edgar Armhold. He expressed nothing more than the sentiments of the Gentile world, which, by the teaching of ministers in the service of God, imbibes the belief that Israel is an accursed and unprincipled race, and which belief Israel, by its silly ambition to remain a peculiar people, isolated from the rest of mankind in its social connections, indirectly strengthens. 
                  "But I am confident," he continued, laughing, "that he'll make but little use of these books. Believe me, cousin, they are so soiled and slush-soaked, that I have my serious doubts whether or not a single page has escaped uninjured." 
                  The conversation then turned upon something else; but, as it has nothing to do with our story, we'll dispense with telling it. They neared the post-office, and soon were lost in the crowd assembled there. 
                  We catch up again with Hannah at five o'clock, but not on Fourth-street. Across the canal. She was quite alone, and inquiringly looking at several old buildings. She was hunting the dwelling of the poor widow, for whom she had collected some money. She had forgotten both her name and the number of her house. 
                  "Are any poor people living in this neighborhood?" she inquired of a little boy who was loitering at the door of a candy-shop. 
                  "Yes, ma'am," he replied; "there are some living in that big house yonder. But you mustn't go in the store, for there are rich folks. You must go through the sidealley-yes, ma'am, through the side-alley," and he pointed out the house. 
                  Hannah placed a half-dollar in his small, unwashed hand, then followed the direction given, in the hope of finding the widow she was in search of. She went through the side-alley, ascended two flights of stairs, and knocked at the first door she came to. 
                  "Come in," said a silvery voice from within. 
                  She gently turned the knob, and half-way opened the door. A strange feeling crept through her frame. She did not enter, but remained standing in the small aperture, her blue eyes riveted on the objects within. 
                  Where was she, and what was she gazing upon? 
                  She was in the dwelling of Emil Armhold, and was gazing upon its occupants. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Awhile she stood 
                              Transformed by grief to marble; and appeared 
                              Her own pale monument; but when she breathed 
                              The secret anguish of her wounded soul, 
                              So moving were the plaints, they would have soothed 
                              The stooping falcon to suspend his flight, 
                              And spare his morning prey. 
                           
                         
                        FENTON'S MARIAMNE. 
                      
                   
                  EDGAR arrived at the pawnbroker's, pervaded by that painful and oppressive feeling which arose from the knowledge of being on a mission, which, judging from the character of the man he had to deal with, must be attended with ill success; and by that ill success would be closed the bars of escape from pending perils. He was, therefore, by no means surprised to see the pawnbroker, who had in an indifferent manner examined the books, slowly turning away from the counter, even without saying a single word in reference to them. 
                  "Can you loan me any money on these books?" commenced Edgar, in a low voice, after a pause of a few minutes, during which time he was looking at the pawnbroker, and the pawnbroker at the plated silverware in the show-case. 
                  No reply. 
                  "Can you loan me any money on these books?" Edgar ventured to repeat for the second time; but the very intonation of his voice expressed that he expected but very little, if any thing, from this stony-hearted man. 
                  "Sir?" replied the money-lender slowly, allowing his eyes to rest for a moment upon the sad and serene brow of our young hero, who continued in a faltering voice: 
                  "Excuse me for disturbing you. These books-you have examined them-they are standard works-somewhat soiled, but I hope it will not materially decrease their value-can you-will you loan me any thing on them?" 
                   
                  O, how his thin, pale lips trembled, as these words fell from his tongue! 
                  The pawnbroker was in no hurry to answer. He was reading the notices of "sheriff's sales." However, he did answer, after a short pause. 
                  "No," he said. 
                  "No!" Edgar expected that much; and yet the cool manner in which that "No" was pronounced, suspended for a moment the pulsation of his heart, and made him feel as if a heavy stone, which had been pressing him to the ground for some time, had all at once crushed the life out of him. For some moments he stood there, petrified. Not a muscle moved to indicate life within. He was not thinking even-this "No" had had such a stunning effect on his brain. He seemed deprived of his own individuality; and if he still had any ideas, the medium of communication that could have made him conscious of them, was lost for the present. 
                  One-two-three-four minutes, and he still stood there as if transfixed to the floor. At last he roused himself from the strange torpor that had overtaken him, and heaved a long, heavy sigh. He raised his deep, dark eyes toward the pawnbroker-looked at him with that doubtful expression which partakes alike of irresolution and apprehension; then, walking back a few paces, pulled off his coat and vest. 
                  He threw the former on the counter; the latter he held in his hand. 
                  "Sir," he said, not much louder than a whisper, as he once more placed himself in front of the pawnbroker, who, when he saw the other approach him, laid his newspaper aside-"sir, I need money-" 
                  A pause of several minutes ensued. Edgar raised his arm and exhibited his vest. 
                  "Look at this vest!" he continued; "I have only worn it twice; it is as good as new. It cost me seven dollars. How much will you loan me on it and on those books?" 
                  There was a slight tremor perceptible in his speech. 
                  "Do you take this for a slop-shop?" said the pawnbroker. 
                  "No, sir; but I need money." 
                  "But I don't need old clothes." 
                  "This vest is not old; indeed, it is not, sir." 
                  "How much money do you want?" 
                  "I must have two dollars and fifty cents." 
                  The pawnbroker said nothing; he only shrugged his shoulder, picked up the paper and again began to read. 
                  Edgar's eyes were still on him; for some moments he studied his cold features. 
                  "Will you loan me the two dollars and a half?" 
                  "No." 
                  "How much will you loan me?" 
                  "One dollar." 
                  This was said without looking up from the paper. The pawnbroker evidently understood his business. 
                  Five minutes passed, and neither spoke. 
                  "Let me have the dollar," said Edgar, indistinctly, again pulling on his thin coat, and buttoning it up to his chin, in order to protect his slender frame from the effects of the unpleasant March weather. "Let me have the dollar." 
                  It was given to him. He did not look up to examine it; he kept it in his hand, rushed out of the store, hurried down the street, the wind playing with his beautiful black hair, and murmuring dirges into his ears. He reached the house of his landlord, ran up the few marble stiles, and rung the side-bell. He was not admitted through the front door; it was the entrance for gentlemen, not for poor folks. He was told to go around the walk and enter by the way of the servants' apartment. He bowed, and did as he was told. Poor Edgar stood at last in the office, by the side of his landlord, who remarked: 
                  "I presume you have brought the money?" 
                  "No, sir; not all," he faltered. "I have but five dollars and fifty cents. Believe me, sir, I have tried my utmost to get all." 
                  "Without success-is it not so?" 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "Well, you may look out for some other locality; in mine you shan't stay another day-do you hear that? not another day. A fellow who can't raise the pitiful sum of seven dollars per month is, in my opinion, a pauper, and I am not the person to keep paupers as tenants." 
                  "Sir, I am poor, but not a pauper." 
                  "Don't contradict my words, young man, else I will have you kicked out of the office. You impertinent booby! Give me the money you have, then go, and don't show me your face again." 
                  Edgar was about to unbutton his coat, when he started back a few steps, and placed his hand on his brow, as if an unpleasant thought had flashed across his mind. 
                  His money-four dollars and fifty cents-was gone; he had left it in his vest-pocket. He began to tremble from head to foot, from top to toe. He knew the landlord would not believe him. 
                  "I have left all but this dollar," he said, in a choking voice, tremblingly laying the dollar on the desk-"in my vest-pocket-" 
                  The lanlord did not suffer him to finish the sentence. 
                  "You left it at some whisky-shop," he thundered, "at some whisky-shop, or, for aught I know, at the gaming-table. Young man," and he pointed the index-finger at him, "if I have not the money by night, expect to see the sheriff on the morrow. I presume he can find sufficient furniture to cover my debt." 
                  Edgar trembled; he fancied he saw that officer removing his blind mother's and dumb father's bedstead. 
                  "O, sir-" 
                  "Go, sir! Leave me!" interrupted the landlord. "I don't wish to hear more. Go!" 
                  Edgar did go. Again he was on the street, with a form that seemed as light as a feather, and with a heart that was as heavy as lead. Not a tear was in his eyes; not a sigh escaped his lips. The wind was blowing very cold now; at any other time, and under different circumstances, it would have chilled him to the very bones; but now-now-he felt not its nipping pain. He was hurrying back to the pawnbroker's. His black hair flew wildly in the wind, and the people whom he passed looked at him with astonishment. Some laughed at him. He did not observe it; but he went his way, and, at last, arrived at his destination. 
                  
                     The pawnbroker's office was closed! For a moment he gazed, bewildered, at the door, then, seating himself on a goods-box which stood in front of the house, turned his face toward the wall, and began to weep-weep as never mortal wept before. Every tear was a priceless gem-a glittering pearl, wrung from misery. It was the wealth of a breaking heart; it was a sacrifice worthy of an angel. 
                  He wept! Depth of misery finds relief in solitude. Why should we intrude? Let us part with him for some moments. 
                  We return to Hannah, whom we left standing in the aperture of the half-opened door that led into the room occupied by Edgar's parents. She neither advanced nor receded, but for some time remained motionless and gazed at the occupants within. 
                  On a broad, square arm-chair, made of wood, placed against the wall, sat erect the tall, and once athletic figure of an old man, whose face was pale, calm and thoughtful, and whose snow-white hair and snow-white beard inspired one with awe and admiration. His thoughtful eyes were resting upon her features, but his lips remained closed, and not a muscle stirred to indicate life within. She thought she beheld the corpse of a centenarian, with the serenity of heaven and the communicative intelligence of life. 
                  A short distance to the left of him sat an old lady with her knitting in hand. Her eyes were also turned toward the door, but as Hannah encountered them she imagined, owing to their peculiar want of any and every expression, that she saw spread out before her a picture of death in the mirror of night. 
                  Need we say who these persons were? 
                  Our readers have recognized them; they were Emil Armhold and his wife. They had heard the gentle tap at the door, and now awaited the entrance of the stranger. 
                  "Come in, ma'am," said little Ruth, politely, as she noticed the hesitancy of Hannah, and rose from her seat by her foster-mother. 
                  Hannah entered; something impelled her onward, though she knew it not herself, in the widow's department. But as her eyes fell on the features of little Ruth she recoiled from them, and was about to turn back, when the soft and melancholy tones of the old lady arrested her footsteps, and rooted them to the floor. 
                  "Who is here, my daughter?" said Mrs. Armhold. 
                  "A young lady, mother." 
                  "Offer her a seat, my daughter." 
                  Ruth got a chair, and placed it at the service of Miss Hannah. 
                  "Will you please to sit down?" 
                  Hannah seated herself; she knew not what to make of this peculiar family. The silver-haired man was still gazing at her, with that same calm look that first encountered her eyes, while the old lady now raised her wrinkled but benevolent face, and, allowing her hands to drop upon her knees, whispered to Ruth, who was again seated by her side: 
                  "Have you offered the lady a chair?" 
                  "I have, dear mother." 
                  Mrs. Armhold rose to her feet, and as she did so her knitting fell out of her lap. Little Ruth did not observe it, so the old lady herself stooped down, and with her hands fumbled for it on the floor. Hannah observed her unsuccessful attempts, and at once the truth flashed across her mind-she was in the presence of the blind. 
                  Quick as thought she was on the floor, picked up the knitting, and placed it in Mrs. Armhold's hands, saying: 
                  "Excuse me for even allowing you to stoop; you seem to see but poorly." 
                  Her voice was both sweet and respectful. 
                  "I'm quite blind, kind stranger," replied Mrs. Armhold, taking hold of Hannah's hand. "I have not seen the beautiful day for years." 
                  "Let me conduct you back to your seat, good lady." 
                  "Nay, spare yourself that trouble; I know every nook and corner in this room, and can with ease find my way back to my seat. But tell me, young lady, is it any thing that I can do for you?" 
                  "No, ma'am," replied Hannah; "I came here through mistake, and therefore, hope you will pardon this intrusion. I have been misdirected. It was a widow lady whose accquaintance I have but lately made, whom I was in search of. Know you of such a lady? She is poor and has several small children." 
                  "I know of no such person in this house; do you, daughter?" 
                  "No, mother," replied Ruth; "but if the lady wishes, I will inquire in the neighboring rooms. It will only take me a few moments." 
                  "Go, my daughter, and see," said Mrs. Armhold; then addressing herself to Hannah, "Will you not be seated until my daughter returns?" 
                  Hannah took a seat, while Ruth left the room. 
                  "You do not live in these parts, young lady?" commenced Mrs. Armhold, bending her head down upon the knitting she could not see. 
                  "No, ma'am; I live in Avondale. It is the first time that I have ever been in this neighborhood. This is not exactly the place I should choose to live in." 
                  "May I ask you why?" 
                  "Because I don't like it. I live where there is plenty of room and plenty of fresh air; but here you have neither. Do you like to live here?" 
                  "We are poor people, and hardly can afford to pay the rent for this lodging; we are, however, thankful to the God of Israel for this home, and feel quite content in it." 
                  "You are Jews?" said Hannah, turning somewhat paler. 
                  "Yes, ma'am, we believe in Jehovah. I presume you are no Jewess?" 
                  "No, ma'am; I am a Christian," she replied, with emphasis, a bitter smile curling her thin lips. Just then her eyes fell on the serene features of Mr. Armhold, whose white hair and white flowing beard seemed to reproach her for her bitterness. 
                  "This is your husband, I presume?" she continued, in a softer strain. 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  Mr. Armhold rose from his seat, and slowly and noiselessly approached Hannah. When he was by her side, he extended his right hand to her. She rose, bowed slightly, but refused to touch it. How could she shake hands with a Jew? 
                  Mr. Armhold gazed at her for a moment, dropped his arm, and slowly returned to his seat. His brow was still serene and unruffled, wearing an expression of humility and resignation. 
                  Hannah again gazed into his placid countenance. 
                  "How old are you, sir?" she inquired. 
                  He raised his right hand to his lips, and sadly nodded his head. 
                  She interpreted the sign correctly, and turned pale. Her pride was lost in pity, and bright tears came into her eyes. 
                  "My husband is seven-and-sixty," said Mrs. Armhold, after a short pause. "His tongue is palsied; he can not speak." 
                  With what sadness poor Rebecca uttered these words! 
                  Again Hannah's eyes rested on the old man's face. O, how her heart smote her for her conduct toward him! She was proud and haughty, but she was noble and generous as well. 
                  "You are greatly afflicted, my good people,' she said, sympathetically. 
                  "It is a decree of Heaven, lady-a decree of Jehovah," replied Mrs. Armhold, and a tear fell from her sightless eyes and trickled down the wrinkles of her sunken cheeks. 
                  "The little girl I saw here-is she your daughter?" 
                  "She is an adopted child. We have, however, two sons," replied Mrs. Armhold, her head bending over her knitting. 
                  "Two sons? And do they live in Cincinnati?" 
                  "Only one of them." 
                  "And is he good to you and your husband?" 
                  "Good to us!" exclaimed the mother, with tears gathering in her eyes, and allowing both her hands and her knitting to drop into her lap. "Good to us? What would become of us had we not that boy? Where would we be without him? O, lady, lady, lady, you can not know how good he is to us!" and here she raised her head heavenward, and the tears began to fall more freely from those dark, meaningless orbs. "He is our only prop-our only support-our sole protector. O, God! God! spare us our boy-our good, good boy! He is so gentle, so kind, so loving to his old and stricken parents! Good to us, did you ask? O, lady, you do not know him. He is the very soul of goodness. His poor mother should die without him!" And she covered her face with her hands, and fairly succumbed to the strong emotions now pervading her frail system. 
                  "Is he rich, good woman?" inquired Hannah, in a soft tone, at the same time feeling for her purse in her pocket. 
                  After a pause of some seconds, Mrs. Armhold, being a little more calm and composed, said: 
                  "No, ma'am: he is but a poor, poor young man. He labors hard and incessantly in order to support his weak and infirm parents. During the day he is employed as bookkeeper in some large commission house down town; and at nights, semetimes till one and two, he copies letters and other manuscripts. The salary he gets of his regular employers is barely sufficient to defray our household expenses. We have been sick, too, and you know doctors charge so much for their visits, and medicine is costly. We had to have money, and so he worked at nights, giving us every cent he earned, and all this without a complaint-without a murmur." 
                  Hannah pulled out her purse and placed it in the hand of Mrs. Armhold, who remarked, as she felt its weight: 
                  "What's this?" 
                  "Nothing-a little money-don't say any thing-just keep it." 
                  "No, no; take it back, kind lady, and with it our thanks. 'Tis true, we are poor, yet rich enough to live without the aid of strangers. Our son would be grieved to death were I to take one solitary cent. Though humble in his dealings with the world, he still has pride and honor; and would rather satisfy his hunger with a crumb of bread earned by himself, than feed on dainties purchased with a stranger's means." 
                  Hannah withdrew the purse. She admired the spirit of that young man. He had a character-was proud and independent. It pleased her, and at once enlisted her sympathy in his behalf. 
                  "Excuse me for having offered you this money. Believe me, I did not wish to offend you," she said; then, changing somewhat the subject, added: 
                  "Have you been living long in this city?" 
                  Mrs. Armhold gave Hannah a brief biography of her life since her arrival, some fifteen years before, in America. Nothing was omitted save what might have wounded the feelings of her husband, who was still sitting in the wooden arm-chair, smoking a long pipe, and mechanically watching the upward-curling clouds. A full half-hour passed, and still Hannah was listening to the sad, sad tale that tremblingly fell, amid tears, sighs and sobs, from Rebecca's lips; and an indescribable feeling of commiseration melted her heart, and made her forget for a moment both her pride and prejudice. 
                  "Yes," continued Mrs. Armhold, "thus kindly acts our son toward us. Is it then a wonder that we love him? We can hardly bide the time of his arrival, for despite his daily labors, when in our midst he seems to forget the cares and troubles of his mind, and, with a cheerful voice, he helps us while away an evening hour." 
                  "When does your son return?" 
                  "Between six and seven, though yesterday he came somewhat earlier." 
                  "Who are his employers?" 
                  "James Preston & Co?" 
                  "Who? James Preston & Co?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am; my son is in their employ." 
                  Hannah turned as white as a linen sheet, and, as she bent her head forward, her form trembled as an aspen leaf. 
                  "What is your son's name?" she inquired, in a low voice, but poorly concealing the excitement under which she labored. 
                  "Edgar Armhold." 
                  
                     Edgar Armhold! These words fell upon her ear like a thunderbolt. She was confounded-spell-bound-stupefied. She could not keep her eyes from the wrinkled face of the old lady. Her ashy lips, which were partly opened, began to quiver. 
                  
                     Edgar Armhold! Is it possible that she had so shamefully misunderstood-misjudged his character? Is it possible that he was as great and noble as she had thought him low and debased? Is it possible that she had wronged the noblest of souls? She could hardly believe-comprehend the sad story she had just heard. 
                  "You say Edgar Armhold is your son?" she asked, after a short pause. 
                  "Yes, ma'am," replied the old lady, having again the knitting in her hand, over which her lightless eyes were bent. 
                  "And he is book-keeper of the firm of James Preston&Co?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  Another pause-it was a long pause. 
                  Hannah rose from her seat, and, pleading headache, walked up and down the room. She saw some books lying on the desk; she moved her chair toward it, and began to read first a little in this book-then in that, and then again in another. Her hand came in contact with all: her mind was evidently not with this employment. But what was it that at once arrested her eyes and riveted them on the upper shelf of the desk? What was it? It was a blank-book, on the back of which were written the following words: 
                  "Edgar Armhold s Private Journal." What a temptation! Here she could discover what he thought of her! She looked around the room-the blind old lady sat knitting-the silver-headed man was dozing. Should she peep into it? Should she overstep all rules of propriety? Should she rob him of the secrets he even did not confide to his mother? 
                  She yielded to the temptation. 
                  Two minutes later the journal lay open before her. Her head was bent down over it; page after page was turned, and page after page was read. Her face became as white as snow! She finally reached the last two pages which contained the account of all his struggles since his dismissal from the service of Mr. Preston. The last lines were written just before he had started out for the second time to the pawnbroker's. They spoke the deep agony of his soul. Hannah read them all at least half a dozen times; and when she laid the journal back upon the shelf, her blue eyes swam in tears. 
                  She rose to her feet, and as she stood before the desk, gazed intently at the poor, afflicted lady for some moments; then, approaching her noiselessly, she fell upon her knees, kissed her hand, and amid a shower of tears, exclaimed: 
                  "Bless me, mother! Bless me!" 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XIV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              He climbs the crackling staris-he bursts the door, 
                              Nor feels his feet glow scorching with the floor; 
                              His breath chocked gasping with the volumed smoke, 
                              But still from room to room his way he broke. 
                           
                         
                        LORD BYRON'S CORSAIR. 
                      
                   
                  NOTHING is more common in great and lofty natures than transitions from one extreme to another. Therefore, the reader must not be astonished that Miss Hannah Preston, whom we may justly place in that category, after she had discovered the misery of this family and the great injustice of which she had been guilty to one of its members, began to see the magnitude of her sins, and learned to pity what she had once despised, and to love what she had once hated. 
                  As she was thus a sincere penitent, kneeling before the meek and blind Mrs. Armhold, with her head buried in her jeweled hands, the whole past swept like a dream of reproach across her troubled mind. Again she seemed to hear every word she had so sarcastically spoken to Edgar, and his mild, evasive and inoffensive replies to them. She remembered with what bitter taunts she had greeted him when he, some few days before, had offered for the poor his little mite. She also remembered with what equanimity and self-control he had suffered her to fling into his face the silver coin he had donated. Yes, she remorsefully remembered all this, and therefore wept as great souls will weep when their noble hearts break for the noble hearts they have broken. She could not forget for a moment the woful expression of his face and the sadness of his dreamy black eyes, as she had seen them on Fourth street. So soft-so calm-so resigned! O, how she could have reproached Lionel for having obeyed her request, and for his unwarranted conduct toward Edgar, the magnitude of whose sufferings she saw even increased by the force of her overwrought imagination! 
                  "Bless me, mother-bless me," she repeated, in a stifled voice. 
                  Mrs. Armhold could not imagine for a moment the cause that brought to her feet that strange, young lady, weeping and begging for a blessing. 
                  "May the good God-the God of Israel-bless you," she said fervently, sympathizing with the unknown sorrows of the young lady on her knees. "But tell me, who are you, girl?" 
                  "An unhappy-a very unhappy creature." 
                  The old lady gently passed her thin and trembling hands over Hannah's face. It had become a habit of hers to study by the touch of her hands the physiognomy of those who came to see her, and in whom she took an interest. 
                  "You have a pretty face, my lady," she said, in a soft voice, after her hands had several times passed over it. "You have a pretty face-" 
                  "But a wicked heart." 
                  Mrs. Armhold replied by pressing a kiss upon the unhappy maiden's brow. 
                  "Do you know whom you have kissed?" shrieked Hannah, at once rising to her feet, her tearful eye; resting on Mrs. Armhold's wrinkled face. "Do you know whom you have kissed?" 
                  "A suffering being who has my fullest sympathy." 
                  "Say rather a miserable wretch, good woman, who deserves your bitterest curses." 
                  "I do not understand you, Miss." 
                  "You do not understand me?" she echoed back, drearily; "I believe you, Mrs. Armhold, for I do not understand me myself;" and she inclined her head upon her bosom, and, covering up her face with her handkerchief, gave way to her emotion and wept in silence. 
                  Mr. Armhold, who had for some time thrown off the lethargic drowsiness in which he had fallen, and who had watched Hannah for several moments, now rose from his chair and noiselessly crossed the room and approached her. When he was by her side, he gently took hold of her right hand and pressed it in his own; then, as she raised her tearful eyes toward the serene brow of the silver-haired mute, he erected his figure, softly laid the maidens head upon his bosom, and pointed with his index-finger heavenward. 
                  "Father," she faltered, at the same time falling upon her knees, "I am rich, very rich-you are poor and infirm-here-"she could say no more. She placed her well-filled purse in his hand, and rushed toward the door. But ere she could reach it, she heard the money chink on the floor. Something within her told her to stop. She involuntarily turned her face, and, as she did so, she encountered the eyes of Mr. Armhold, who, with his finger now pointed to the purse he had dropped out of his hand, expressed, in the movement of his outstretched arm, and in the mute language of his eyes and serene features, that he refused the proffered money, and desired her to pick it up and return it to her pocket. Slowly she retraced her steps, kneeled down, picked up the purse, and with it approached Mrs. Armhold. 
                  "You take it, good woman-mother," she pleaded earnestly, fervently, "I'm sure you will not be offended at me. I respect your pride and independence, and therefore would not wound your feelings. But take this little money-do-will you, good mother?" 
                  O, how tenderly she uttered these words! 
                  "Do take it, please," she insisted in the same strain, "and make me happy-will you?" and she gently placed her arm around the neck of Mrs. Armhold, and pressed a kiss upon her wrinkled brow. 
                  "Lady, I do not know you, and can not see you; but you have a warm heart-a generous soul-and I love you for it. Were all the world like you, believe me, there would be no tears to shed. Take back your purse, and with it the thanks and blessings of the blind old woman. We are not now in want; no, in sooth. Edgar, our noble boy, earns all we need-what should we do with more?" 
                  "But Edgar may get sick-" 
                  "God forbid!" 
                  "Or-his employer may discharge him. What would then become of you? Who would pay your rent, your fuel, your doctor-bills, and all the incidental expenses incurred in the support of a family? Come, good mother, and consider all this; it must be very hard to be without money. The landlord may come and drive you forth. I shudder to think on't-O, take this money." 
                   
                  Once more she placed the purse in Mrs. Armhold's hand, and once more the latter returned it to Hannah. All her arts of persuasion were thrown away-the money was not accepted. The somber shades of evening were beginning to darken the room, when little Ruth made her appearance with the information that she had diligently inquired for the poor widow the young lady had described, but could not find any such person in the neighborhood. 
                  "Has Edgar not yet returned?" she added, in a low voice. 
                  Hannah heard it, and turned pale. 
                  "Do you expect your son home so early?" she inquired, exhibiting considerable uneasiness. 
                  "Yes, ma'am," she replied, "he comes now somewhat earlier than usual. He leaves the office about six o'clock, in order to take his supper, then goes to his employer-Mr. Preston-who has been sick for several months, and brings to him such letters as may have arrived for him during the day." 
                  Hannah did not choose to await Edgar's arrival-she would sooner have died than met him after what had transpired, and what she had learned. She would have sunk into the ground with shame had he now made his appearance. How could she face the man she had wronged so much? 
                  "I must be gone, Mrs. Armhold," she said hastily; "it is getting late, and I live a great distance from here." 
                  "Remain here until my son returns, and he shall conduct you safely home," replied Mrs. Armhold, as she stood by the side of the beautiful and fashionable young lady, whose jeweled hand she was affectionately holding in her own. "Yes, my son shall conduct you safely home-if you are-not-ashamed-" and here she seemed to space every word-"to walk-with a poor-young man and-a Jew." 
                  She lowered her head, and suffered the hands of Hannah, which she held in her own, gently to drop. 
                  "Nay, good woman," said Hannah, "I prefer to go alone. Besides I have no fears;" and she proudly tossed her graceful head aloft, and a bright flash of light shot through her eyes. 
                  Just then she heard some one ascend the stairs. A pain shot through her frame, and her cheeks became as pale as death. Could it be he? She would not stay to see. She threw her vail over her face, and quick as thought hastened from the room. 
                  "Call you driver for me, please," she said to a boy after she had reached the street. 
                  A few minutes later we find her seated in a coach, which was carrying her home-to Avondale. We shall not follow her now, but suffer her to ponder over the strange and confused thoughts that absorbed her whole mind, and once more return to Edgar, whom we left disconsolately seated on a box in front of the pawnbroker's office, with his pale face turned toward the wall, so that the bitter tears that fell from his eyes might not be observed by the passers-by. 
                  Thus then-twenty-thirty minutes passed and still no pawnbroker made his appearance. Edgar dried his tears, rose to his feet, and went into the adjoining office in order to find out the pawnbroker's residence. No one knew or cared where he lived. Disheartened he left the place, and walked across the square, and, after a few moment's reflection, he turned around, retraced his steps, and went to Pearl-street. He stopped before the store-house of Mr. Preston. He fell back a pace-the doors were already locked. For more than five minutes he gazed at them with that blank, unmeaning seriousness that expresses stupefication in its highest degree. 
                  It grew darker, the wind blew louder, and drearily moaned into his ears. He heaved a long, heavy sigh, lowered his head, and slowly walked away. 
                  A half hour later we find him at home, seated by the side of his mother, father, and Ruth. A sad smile was on his face; he spoke freely, and sometimes appeared a little merry. 
                  His mother told him of the strange young lady, and the conversation that had passed between them. He appeared to listen attentively to the recital-but O, how his heart ached within him-how his thoughts pressed upon him-but still he smiled and laughed-and kept his sorrows concealed from his parents. 
                  They took supper. 
                  Soon after he repaired to his desk, opened his journal, and wrote therein the sad events of this day. Having noted down everything of importance, he added the following: 
                  "I am on the verge of distraction-God-O, God! give me strength to bear up under this my greatest trial! I must shed some tears-my heart is too full-it will burst-it will burst. I am calm once more. Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage. I will be above my misfortunes. 
                  "And yet there is but one other source open for me. If that should fail-but it must not-can not fail me. I shall at once go to Mr. Preston-he is a gentleman, despite his conduct toward me. I shall confide my sorrows to him-ask him for the wages due me-he will pardon the request and the untimely hour in which it is made, and he will help me. 
                  "But if he should not?" 
                  "O, father Joseph! father Joseph! And is mankind indeed only a congregation of polished barbarians? How many persons hide in the nooks and corners of the world, who, like myself, are doomed to feel the weight of oppression? How many have great sorrows buried in their hearts, and solitarily pine away-droop their heads, and thus fall into the sleep that knows no waking? How many feel the bitter agonies of death; and still-and still the earth revolves around its axis, bearing upon its smiling face a jolly crew of madmen, their discordant, boisterous laughter drowning the plaintive voice of fallen brothers, upon whose prostrate forms they trample with iron hoofs, and, yelling, reel and dance the ghastly dance of death? 
                  "O, God! are our intellects, then, disordered-our minds diseased-or are we but the offal of all creation's offal-a compound of all evils-the vice of vice-a universal scourge-the Titans of monstrosity? 
                  "Let me weep-let me weep-O, let me weep-" 
                  He closed the journal, and laid it back upon the shelf. A faint smile-the smile of the happy dying-danced upon his thin lips. It could not be observed-it was too faint-reminding one more of the shadow than the substance. It gave his countenance the beauty of heaven with the sadness of earth. 
                  Again he joined his parents-how happy he was that they, at least, knew nothing of his sorrows!-and spoke to them with that tenderness that lulls to sleep the evil demon, and awakens the angel of peace and love. Yes, he spoke to them as if nothing unusual had occurred to depress his spirit and cast a gloomy pall over all his thoughts. 
                  "Have you paid the rent, Edgar?" asked his mother, who was again at her knitting. 
                  He had been anticipating this question; he was not taken by surprise. 
                  "No, ma'am; but it shall be paid in time, good mother. You know I have not yet seen Mr. Preston; I shall not forget to make the proper arrangements this evening," he replied in a nonchalant tone, putting no stress whatever on the words. 
                  Mrs. Armhold was satisfied. She was blind; but if she had not been so, it would have been impossible for her-though being his mother-to see in his serene face the inward struggle. 
                  I said Mrs. Armhold was satisfied; she thought Edgar incapable of deception, and yet he had deceived her. Was he excusable for the practice of this deception, and if he was, should man, at times, not also be excusable for other wrongs-results of emergencies? 
                  Who will answer? 
                  Not I. 
                  Edgar fell into a profound reverie, and the scenes of this day's bitter trials seemed shifting themselves respectively before his mind's eye. No one disturbed him; deeply and more deeply he became absorbed. His ideas became more confused-the strength both of of his body and mind relaxed-he lowered his head-his arms fell down by his side- 
                  Edgar had fallen asleep. 
                  "Edgar sleeps, mother," whispered Ruth in Mrs. Armhold's ear. 
                  "Don't wake him, daughter. He must have worked hard to-day-let him rest." 
                  Mr. Armhold was also dozing. The room was as still as death. The falling of a pin could have been heard from one end of the room to the other. 
                  Mrs. Armhold was knitting; Ruth sat by her side, looking at Edgar. Not for a second did she turn her eyes from his pale, angelic face. 
                  Ruth was not quite eight years old. 
                  Why was she gazing at him? 
                  Did she know it? 
                  No! 
                  Let us not disturb them. 
                  We take our flight to Avondale-into the dwelling of Mr. James Preston. Hannah was at home. She stood by the side of her father. Her face was as colorless as the freshly-fallen snow. 
                  "Father," she said, "you have dismissed Edgar Armhold to please your daughter?" 
                  Mr. Preston nodded his head in the affirmative. 
                  "To please your daughter, reinstate him again." 
                  "Edgar Armhold? Why, my daughter?" he asked, astonished. 
                  "I labored under a wrong impression, father, when I solicited his dismissal. I feel grieved over my conduct. Will you take him back?" 
                  She said this slowly and coolly. 
                  "I don't think I can do it, daughter. I have already given his place to some one else." 
                  "Father!-" 
                  She paused for a moment, then continued with more emphasis, without withdrawing her eyes from his face. 
                  "Father! I have outraged the feeling of this young man; I have shamefully wronged him. He has lost his situation on my account. Let him have it again, father." 
                  "But what shall I do with the person that now fills his place?" 
                  "Discharge him." 
                  Before Mr. Preston could reply to his daughter's pointed remark, they were joined by several young gentlemen-asssociates of Newton-who had been in the drawing-room, and having heard the voice of Hannah, hastened to the hall to conduct her into the midst of a circle of ladies and gentlemen, who, by Newton's invitation, had come to spent the evening there. She pleaded indisposition-and in fact, she looked paler than usual-begged to be excused from sharing the pleasure of their company, and then, while her father followed them into the parlor, she stealthily ascended two flights of stairs, and betook herself to her private apartment. 
                  She seated herself by the window, and resting her head upon her elbow, looked mechanically into the dark azure without. Everything that had transpired to her during this eventful day obtruded itself on her memory, and made her thoughtful. The information she had gained from Edgar's journal recurred to her mind, making her feel unusually sad; her proud, stern features relaxed and, withdrawing her gaze from the street, she covered her face with her handkerchief, to weep in silence. 
                  Did she know why? 
                  Scarcely. 
                  She wept because she just felt like weeping; and yet she would not have taken the world to have been caught in this plight. 
                  She rose and locked the door. 
                  She looked into the mirror-her eyes were red. 
                  "Fool!" she exclaimed, half aloud, proudly tossed her head aloft, disdainfully curled her thin lips, dried her tears, and then haughtily moved across the room and seated herself by the window. 
                  Her heart was heavy-something oppressed it. She drew long breaths and heaved deep sighs. She became restless. It was impossible for her longer to keep her seat. How could she remain calm, when all her feelings were in commotion? She rose to her feet, and began to pace up and down the floor. Her cheeks were ashy pale. 
                  "O, God!" 
                  A long drawn sigh followed this exclamation. 
                  It escaped unconsciously from her lips. This betrayal seemed to aggravate her. She pressed her lips together, as much as to say, "It shall not happen again." 
                  Once more she gazed through the window. She stood there for some time. Her eyes were open, but she saw nothing. She had fallen into a state of utter absorption. 
                  Some one tapped on the door of her room; the sound was accompanied by those words: 
                  "Miss Hannah! your 'ma wants you to descend to the drawing-room. There are so many young folks down stairs-they all miss you." 
                  It was the servant, sent up by Mrs. Preston, who had spoken. 
                  Hannah placed one hand across her brow, trying to collect her scattered thoughts. 
                  "Tell 'ma that I don't want to see any one, and to excuse me," she said in a clear voice, her face turned towards the closed door. 
                  "Good night." 
                  The servant was gone. All still again-so still that it made Hannah feel like weeping-and she wept. She moved her chair to her bed-side, suffered her pale cheeks, down which the tears trickled freely, to lie upon the soft, downy pillow, and fifteen minutes later her beautiful eyes were closed in slumber. 
                  Let us see what was going on below. 
                  Merriment reigned supreme. Those who were there lived directly in the neighborhood-knew one another well, and, being very young, indulged in those games that youth delights to participate in. They alternately played, sang and danced, and their silvery voices rang loudly through the hall. Mr. and Mrs. Preston were also in the drawing-room. Newton was absent; he had been sent into the city by a young coquette to get the Maniac's Waltz, and he had not yet returned. He was also looking for Lionel, who had not made his appearance that evening. 
                  They were just dancing a quadrille, when they heard the cry of "Fire! fire!" At the same moment they saw, felt and inhaled the smoke. 
                  Shrieks and screams! 
                  The smoke became denser, the atmosphere more oppressive. 
                  Excitement and consternation! 
                  James Preston's mansion was in flames! The drawing-room was deserted; the servant's room was deserted; the kitchen was deserted; the whole house was deserted! 
                  The fire spread fast; and, as the March wind was blowing hard, but a few minutes elapsed before the whole structure was enveloped in red, luminous flames. The night was pitch-dark, and the bright light could be seen far and wide. Red clouds of smoke hovered over Avondale. The deep-toned alarm-bells rang through the air, and fire-spouting engines rattled hastily along the streets of Cincinnati. 
                  Make room-make room! The foaming steeds draw nigh! 
                  But it was a good distance to Avondale, and in the mean time the fire had consumed part of the front building. The atmosphere around it became insufferably hot, compelling the crowd to retire some few paces. 
                  At that moment a wild shriek rang through the air. It came from one of the upper rooms of Mr. Preston's house. 
                  It was the voice of Hannah! It was recognized by all. Mrs. Preston fainted; Mr. Preston turned as white as a corpse. In the excitement and consternation of the moment they had forgotten that Hannah had not yet left the house. 
                  She stood by the window, a picture of despair. The flames were already lifting their fiery fingers in that direction. 
                  Once more her shrill voice pierced the air; it was evident the hungry flames would consume her, unless speedy assistance should save her from that horrible doom. 
                  Both doors-the front and the back door-were in flames; it would have been certain death to enter either. As the spectators thought of the fate awaiting the inmate of this ill-fated house, and the chance to save her, a cold chill crept through their marrow. 
                  "Help!" 
                  It was but indistinctly heard. The flames had driven Hannah from the window. 
                  "Help! help!" the cry came fainter and fainter. Smoke-dense smoke welled through the window. Not a breath was heard below. Horror sealed the lips of all. 
                  At that moment the crowd fell back. A strange youth hurriedly made his way to the front. All stood aghast, and wildly turned their eyes upon him; but his were strained upon the flame-enveloped house. He was lithe and slender, and erect as a pine. His face was white and effeminately beautiful. His eyes were as black as the raven's wing, and his long hair was of the same dark hue. It hung wildly over his graceful neck and shoulders. He wore a thin, black cloth coat-he threw it off, and hurried forward through the dense clouds of smoke. 
                  A high elm stood in front of the house; its topmost branches were already singed and burning. The stranger gazed at them for a moment, and then began to climb the tree. He seemed to possess the agility of the squirrel. 
                  He looked like a young Apollo enveloped in smoke. 
                  The branches shook-the whole treeshook. 
                  The daring stranger loosened his hold. He made a leap toward the window. He reached it in safety. He drew himself upon it, passed through and disappeared. 
                  Not a breath was heard. It was a moment of awful suspense. Life or death was hanging on a thread. 
                  The wind blew strong and drove away the clouds of smoke. All eyes were still turned toward that window. 
                  Five minutes passed. 
                  The stranger made his appearance. He raised himself up to the sill. He stood in the aperture-the fiery monster all around him. He held the figure of a woman in his arm-she clung around his neck. 
                  The suspense was broken-a wild shout of joy resounded through the air. 
                  But look! Why do the spectators rush back? Why do they hold each other by the hand, and, with parted lips, glare at the window, where still the stranger stands, with the woman resting in his arm? 
                  Hark! A rumbling and toppling! A great crash! The walls were giving way-the house was falling in!
                   
                
                
                  CHAPTER XV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              THE brave man is not he who feels no fear, 
                              For that were stupid and irrational; 
                              But he whose noble soul its fear subdues, 
                              And bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from, 
                              As for your youth, whom blood and blows delight. 
                              Away with them! There is not in their crew 
                              One valiant spirit. 
                           
                         
                        JOANNA BAILIE'S BASIL. 
                      
                   
                  WHEN Edgar awoke it was between the hours of eight and nine. A sharp pang shot through his heart as he remembered were he was and were he ought to be. 
                  "Mother, have I slept too long?" he exclaimed, with considerable uneasiness. 
                  "Something over an hour." 
                  "I did not intend to sleep so long," he said, hastily rose from his seat, approached the window, and cast a glance along the street. Then returning to his mother, he gently took her by the hand, and said: 
                  "Mother, I shall now go to Mr. Preston. It may be late before I return home. Therefore do not wait for me, but retire at your usual hour. And you," turning to little Ruth and softly laying his hand upon her head-"and you will have to do without your lesson to-night." 
                  He attempted to call a faint smile to his ashy lips as he gazed upon his gentle fostersister. It was a futile effort. A cloud of sadness hovered over his calm, pale face. It was impenetrably thick; not a single ray of light could pierce it. 
                  "Mother, I'm going now," he whispered, and kissed both her and little Ruth. 
                  "There is a rough wind blowing, son," said Mrs. Armhold, laying her knitting down into her lap and winding a long woolen scarf around Edgar's neck. "This will shield you from its effects-now you won't be as apt to catch cold." 
                  When he was gone, little Ruth moved nearer to her foster-mother, and, raising her large black eyes towards the serene countenance of the old lady, said in a low voice: 
                  "Edgar looks pale-very pale, mother. I think he is not well." 
                  'Twas all she said-it almost broke her heart to say that. 
                  Mrs. Armhold raised her wrinkled face-stopped knitting-suffered her work to fall from her hands, and raised her head in an attitude peculiarly expressive of thinking. For some time she remained motionless and silent-her eye-lids stood widely opened, and her sightless orbs were immovably bent on the opposite wall. 
                  "Is your father asleep?" she whispered at last in little Ruth's ear. 
                  Ruth turned her face, and looked toward the wooden arm-chair. Mr. Armhold sat there with eyes closed, his flowing white hair and beard looking golden in the pale light emanating from the glowing embers in the hearth. His head was resting against the chair-back. He seemed to resemble the petrified form of some legendary king, whose every feature, though carved in stone, still retained the dignified expression of its former state. 
                  "He is asleep, mother," Ruth whispered. 
                  After a short interval Mrs. Armhold asked: 
                  "Did you say Edgar looks pale, daughter?" 
                  "Yes, mother." 
                  "Very pale?" 
                  "Very pale." 
                  "And sickly?" 
                  "Yes, mother." 
                  Another pause of several minutes ensued. 
                  "Ruth, my daughter, go to bed." 
                   
                  The little girl rose, kissed her foster-mother and retired. 
                  A few minutes later she was asleep. Her light breath, as it regularly rose and fell, could be distinctly heard. 
                  Then Mrs. Armhold tremblingly raised her gingham apron and buried her face in it. No one could hear or see her. She was altogether alone. She could weep her very fill without being observed or disturbed-and the poor afflicted old woman did weep. She felt very-very sad. The long past recurred to her memory-one by one the various scenes and vicissitudes of her life were reviewed by her mind's eye. Where was her Reuben-her own dear Reuben? She loved-madly loved the wild boy, despite his errors. Is he still alive? Will she ever hear his clear, metallic voice again? She entertained some doubts-she knew she was growing old-very old and feeble-and she wept. And now she thought of Edgar-her gentle, uncomplaining Edgar. She imagined that she could see his pale, emaciated cheeks. He was also sinking into the grave. Her big mother-heart almost burst with grief. 
                  She sobbed-sobbed-sobbed. 
                  In the mean time Edgar hurried through the half-deserted streets. We deem it useless to undertake to describe again to the reader the perplexed state of his mind. For we can still remember his down-cast look, his serene brow and ashy pale cheeks, over which hovered an expression of sadness and despondency, which, once being observed, was not likely to be forgotten soon. 
                  We said he hurried through the streets. He traversed the more fashionable quarters. In front of one of these princely mansions lay a quantity of coal. A ragged old man stood by the side of them, leaning with his elbow on the handle of a shovel. He was looking down on the ground-measuring with his eyes the quantity of coals lying there-then shook his head sadly, inaudibly uttering some imprecation, and went to work. Edgar was only separated from him by a few paces; as he came nearer he discovered that the man was partly lame on one limb, and that he could hardly bend the knee. He always pitied the unfortunate-he stopped short and addressed the laborer, in a voice full of tenderness: 
                  "You seem to be afflicted with the rheumatism?" 
                  The old man stopped his work, looked around and exhibited his unprepossessing face. It was neither washed nor shaved. His broad brow was deeply furrowed, and from under his thick and heavy eye-lashes glistened a pair of large gray eyes. Intense hatred shone through every look-hatred to the world-hatred to God who had made such a world. 
                  We said he looked around. He measured Edgar from head to foot, said something in a deep gutteral voice, the meaning of which could not be caught, then went to work again. 
                  Edgar thought the old man had not understood him. 
                  "You seem to be afflicted with the rheumatism?" he repeated, drawing a little nearer. 
                  Again the old man turned his face. A bitter glance darted from his large gray eyes, and an additional wrinkle knit his brow. 
                  "Is it any of your business, puppy?" he growled. "Go your way and let the poor man alone." 
                  The wrongs and injuries of four and fifty years spoke through him. He had once been a jolly lad, but these wrongs had soured his temper. He was the father of five children. The oldest-a boy-was confined in the work-house; the others were at home-young girls-living on their father's earnings. His wife had died some years ago. From that moment he had been no longer the same man. He was never more seen to smile. He was a stone-mason by trade; but having worked too much in the rain which brought on rheumatism, he had to give up that business. Now he did such transient work as he could find. But his joints grew stiffer and stiffer, until he at last found himself almost incapable of doing anything. His children cried for bread, and were compelled to have it. So he went at the heaviest and roughest work-the only sort he could obtain. Carrying coal and the like. The harder the work the poorer the pay. In carrying coal no one ever got rich in money, but poorer in health. It had that effect on him. But still he had to work. The job he had just got paid him twenty-five cents. Fifty bushels of coal to shovel in-a labor of two hours. 
                  A pay of twenty-five cents. 
                  His hair was already gray, and his right arm and limb were paralyzed. To move either caused him considerable pain. 
                  Who cared? 
                  He was a ragged, old man. 
                  We said he was bitter-hate him who will-we only have tears for him. 
                  "I meant to give no offense,"-replied Edgar, apologetically. 
                  Just then the old man was about to lift a heavy coal from the ground, but in trying to do so he found the requisite strength wanting, and not being able to remove his lame foot fast enough, he lost his balance and fell down. 
                  Edgar hastened to his assistance, helped him to his feet, and, without saying a word, bowed down to the ground, picked up the heavy coal that had fallen from the old man's hand, stepped over the pavement, threw it into the cellar, then retraced his steps, and, in a soft tone, asked: 
                  "Are you hurt?" 
                  "No." It was said in a very hoarse voice. 
                  Edgar stood by his side. As he looked at the old man he discovered that his unprotected neck was badly swollen. 
                  "You have a severe cold?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  Edgar took his woolen scarf, wound it gently around the old man's neck and walked away. 
                  The old man dropped his shovel, and looked with amazement at the receding figure of our young hero. 
                  When he began his work again, big tears fell from his eyes. Had he been then observed, he would not have been thought to possess a heart of granite. Such was the effect of one kind act. 
                  Why won't every body be kind? 
                  It is so easy to be kind, if we only would. 
                  We are almost moralizing. Pardon us; we forgot that the term had become obsolete, and for us to use it, would at once expose our bad breeding. 
                  We will hurry on with our story, for we know that when you want to hear morals you go to church in silks and cloths purchased from the poor man's labor. 
                  Where did we leave Edgar? 
                  On his way to Avondale, the March wind playing with his long black hair, and penetrating through his thin coat, which he had still buttoned up. His face was as white as that of a corpse, and his lips, which were partly opened, looked purple. He was feeling the effects of his exposure, but not thinking on them. He was too much absorbed in reflection to heed the cold or the nipping air. Thus he hurried on. He was already at Avondale, when the tolling of the sonorous alarm-bells aroused him from his unnatural torpor. He raised his head, and discovered the northern sky ablaze. He quickened his pace, and was soon lost in the throng of people that were hurrying to the place of conflagration. 
                  It was he whom we have seen scaling the tree and leaping into the window of Mr. Preston's burning house. It was he who had not resented Lionel's insults-he whom Hannah had called a coward-who now laughed danger in the face, and did what no other person present found courage enough to do. 
                  Only in great emergencies the courage of great souls is exhibited. Little things can not disturb the balance of great intellects; ordinary circumstances have no effect on them. The petty spirit and the narrow mind lose equilibrium and equanimity on trivial occurrences, where a great soul and lofty mind would not stoop to waste a single thought. 
                  When the storms are high, and clouds are dark and thick, only then the thunderer howling rides through the heavenly plain, and hurls the blue-and-red forked lightning from his gleaming eyes. When danger looms up like a monster giant, and death is lurking in every corner, and ever-ready brawlers fear to breathe, and stoop crouchingly in their hiding-places, then the hero sallies forth, arraying himself in martial suit, and all alone defies the monster Fate, reversing its decrees, or, like a daring hero, dies in the attempt. 
                  "Help!" This word had wildly pierced the air. 
                  It had been evident that in a very short time, unless assistance should be rendered at once, this voice would be hushed forever. 
                  "Help!" 
                  It had been Hannah's voice-Edgar recognized it. It had been the voice of the one who had so often offended, insulted him. 
                  For a moment a faint smile had lighted up his pale face. 
                  He would have revenge; he had prayed for it a long time, and now it was within his reach. Should he abstain from it? No! 
                  He would save her life at the risk of his own! 
                  What a sweet revenge! 
                  We have seen him enter at the window, around which the red flames were already twining their blazing arms. A moment later he was kneeling by the side of Hannah, who was lying, with her face buried in her hands, on the floor. She raised her eyes, and met his own. A wild, piercing shriek escaped her thin lips, and once more her hands covered up her countenance. 
                  "Fly-fly, Miss Preston! Another moment and you are lost!" 
                  Louder and more frequent were her sobs; but she moved not nor rose from the floor. 
                  Just then a volume of gray smoke rushed in by the window. 
                  Edgar wound his arm around her slender waist. 
                  "Intrust yourself to me," he said, hurriedly; "intrust yourself to me. I will save you, if you will suffer me to do so. To stay here is death!" 
                  Still she remained prostrate on the floor. 
                  "O, Hannah, let me save you!" he pleaded, softly, taking hold of her hand. 
                  She arose and fell upon his bosom. He lifted her in his arms. 
                  He sped with her from the room, trying to find a less dangerous egress through the hall. The fire had already spread through the passage. He was compelled to return to the room, still holding his charge firmly in his arms. He leaped on the window-sill. 
                  It was then that the crash was heard. The back part of the house had given way, and was falling in. 
                  Edgar looked as pale as death, but he was calm. He measured the distance between the window and the nearest branch of the tree. He shook his head in despair. He dared not make the leap with his charge. Desperate thoughts entered his mind. He was no longer the Edgar we have known. His courage had risen with the emergency. Discretion was lost. Death was staring upon him from all directions. 
                  He would tie Hannah on his back, then climb down the wall to the first story, from which, when reached, he would leap to the ground, be the consequences what they may. He was confident that he could, at least, save Hannah's life in this manner. 
                  The wall was constructed of marble; at short and regular intervals some of the stones were projecting at least two inches; he would seize hold on them, and thus descend. 
                  And why not? Feats as daring as this have been performed by resolute men in desperate emergencies-down in deep coal-mines; amid wreck and terror on the ocean; amid the horrors of the battle-field. 
                  Gymnasts have performed them to the wonder and amazement of thrilled spectators. 
                  Here was a case in which life and death hung in the balances; a hair might sway them either way. 
                  And Edgar's spirit, though contrite and lowly, was yet full of daring and enterprise. Besides, he was considered, by all who knew him, an expert gymnast. 
                  His mind was made up. 
                  He looked once more at the mass of amazed spectators, then turned around his colorless face and whispered to his charge, whose arms were twined around his neck: 
                  "Fear not, Hannah, you are safe." Then, in a lower key, "Should I die, think of my parents." 
                  He could say no more. Just then the rattling of the heavy engines and the noise of the drivers broke the stillness of the moment. A wild exclamation of joy rent the air. A ladder was raised up before the house-it reached to the sill of the window. 
                  Edgar took courage. He saw in this the hand of Providence. 
                  "We are saved!" he softly whispered in her ear; but she heard not-she had fainted away. 
                  "Should I die, think of my parents!" 
                  These words had been more than she could bear. He to die for her! As we have seen, she had fainted. 
                  Now he cautiously stepped from the sill to the ladder. But before he had half descended, it had caught fire in several places. Edgar, before leaving the room, had thrown a woolen blanket over her form. Now he drew it also over her head, which was still pillowed on his shoulder, and continued his descent. 
                  
                     The daring stranger landed safely with his charge on the ground.
                   
                  The shouts of joy were deafening. 
                  It was insupportably hot. Not one in the vast crowd, save an old weather-beaten fireman, had the courage to approach them. He took Hannah in his tawny, sinewy arms, and hurried away with her. When he came back to bring her savior, he found him gone. 
                  All this was done in a much shorter period than we have taken to relate it. 
                  Half an hour later Edgar could have been seen gliding stealthily into his room, and after cautiously looking around, and satisfying himself that the whole household were asleep, removed noiselessly a small mahogany box from under his desk. This he opened with a small key, once more looked around, extracted something, concealed it in his coat-pocket, locked the box, replaced it under the desk, and departed. 
                  He had not yet the money to pay his rent! 
                  It was near midnight when he once more returned to his home. His mother was awake and waiting for him. She was seated in her chair, with her head resting on her arm! 
                  How many sleepless hours during the year are thus spent by the poor and afflicted! And still the world is good, and on each square stand high and imposing churches! 
                  Mrs. Armhold had heard the clock strike eleven. She could rest no longer. She had stolen from her bed and had wrapped herself in a heavy woolen shawl-her clothes were too thin-and it had become very cold. 
                  Thus Edgar found his blind mother seated on her chair. 
                  He had never staid out so long. She felt unusually sad and uneasy. She could not banish the thoughts of the information that Ruth had given her. The poor, poor woman had new cause for grief. 
                  "Is it you, Edgar?" she said, amid tears and sobs, as she heard his footsteps. 
                  "It is, mother." 
                  He had scarcely strength enough to utter these few words; they merely trembled on his lips. It was a happy thing that she could not see his face-it wore the hue of death. But she could hear, and, with a mother's quick perception, she discovered in his faint and faltering voice, something more than mere exhaustion. 
                  "Your are sick, my son-I know you are," the doting mother sobbed, the anguish of her soul visible in the wrinkled cheeks and nervous twitching of her lips. "You are sick, my son," she continued, winding her arms around his ice-cold neck, and pressing kisses on his ice-cold face-"you are sick, sick, my heart tells me so." 
                  "To bed! to bed!" he gasped, and fell on the floor. 
                  At the same moment a physician left the mansion of Mr. Hugh Harrington. He had been called in to attend on Miss Hannah Preston, who had been in a delirious state ever since she had awakened from the swoon, in which state she had been brought to her uncle's a few moments after she had been restored to them. For several days she was considered-and was so pronounced by the attending physician-in a critical condition. On the eighth day there was a change for the better, and on the ninth she was once more restored to consciousness. 
                   
                  "Where is he?" were the first words she breathed. "Is he safe?" 
                  "Who, my daughter?" gently asked Mrs. Preston, who had hardly left her daughter's bedside during her illness. "Who, my daughter?" 
                  "My protector!" she said, with some emphasis. 
                  "We do not know what has become of him, my daughter. Your 'pa has offered a reward of five thousand dollars to the savior of his child, but the unknown stranger has not yet called to claim it. Could we only discover his name!" 
                  Hannah's head fell back upon the downy pillow. Tears came to her eyes. 
                  "How long have I been asleep, 'ma?" she whispered, after a short pause. 
                  A faint smile hovered momentarily on Mrs. Preston's lips. 
                  "This is the ninth day of your illness, daughter," she said, "but, thank God, you are better now." 
                  "Nine days!" and Hannah passed her hand over her pale forehead. Her lips quivered-she thought of the Armhold family. What can have become of them? 
                  "'Ma!" she continued, "pray give me some money; I would fain distribute a little among the poor." 
                  Mrs. Preston left the room for a moment. 
                  Hannah had her own servant to wait on her. She was a sprightly girl, who loved her young mistress. She was now by the side of the sick bed. 
                  "Quick!" said Hannah. 
                  "What?" inquired the girl. 
                  Hannah hurriedly whispered something in her ear. 
                  "Did you understand me?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "You must leave the money? Do you hear? You must!" 
                  "I'll be sure to leave it, Miss Hannah." 
                  "Nor tell any one at home-mother, father, nor any one else-any thing about it. Do you understand? I want you to keep it secret." 
                  "You may depend on me, Miss Hannah." 
                  "And you distinctly remember the name?" 
                  "O, yes, 'Mr. Armhold.'" 
                  "Now be silent." 
                  Mrs. Preston once more entered the room, and gave Hannah a purse filled with money. 
                  It was handed to the servant, with the remark to distribute it as directed. 
                  Half an hour afterward some one ascended the stairs. 
                  "'Ma, may I beg you for a glass of water?" 
                  Mrs. Preston left the room, and a few minutes later Hannah's servant girl entered, placing the purse of money into her amazed mistress's hands. 
                  "What's this?" she exclaimed. "Did I not tell you to leave it there?" 
                  "You did, Miss Hannah," apologetically remarked the servant, "but I found the room unoccupied. Mr. Armhold moved away three days ago-no one knows whither." 
                  Hannah's head fell back upon the pillow, and when her mother came in with a glass of water, she discovered that her daughter had fainted.

                              Death is the privilege of human nature 
                              And life without it were not without our taking. 
                              Thither the poor, the prisoner, and the mourner 
                              Fly for relief, and lay their burdens down. 
                           
                         
                        ROWE'S FAIR PENITENT. 
                      
                   
                  We shall not endeavor to describe to you, dear reader, the heart-rending scene immediately subsequent to the swoon of Edgar Armhold. For where is the skillful pen that can do even partial justice in portraying the poignant and life-shortening pangs of the despairing helpless? Where are the words that can convey to the mind even the idea of those bitter, bitter sensations of the gradually breaking heart-those sensations which must be felt in order to be understood? 
                  Not in the vocabulary of the human race. 
                  Therefore, let us not attempt to describe it, but pass it over and suffer these good, old, afflicted people-Mr. and Mrs. Armhold-undisturbedly to grieve and weep by the side of their gentle Edgar, whom they had removed to his couch, where he now lay, though no longer unconscious, still too weak, however, to give utterance to a single word. 
                  Little Ruth was also up. She was sitting on a low stool that stood at the farther end of the room. Her face was turned to the wall, and she was weeping. 
                  Not one of the whole household went to bed that night. 
                  Early on the following morning the physician was sent for. He soon made his appearance and carefully examined the invalid. He assured Mrs. Armhold that her son was in no danger; that it was an exhaustion of both physical and mental strength, from which he would soon recover if he were allowed rest of body and mind. 
                  "You must give him, however," added the doctor, in the act of leaving, "some strengthening nourishment every half hour or so, also some wine. Your son is very much exhausted; he needs strength, good madam, strength, nothing else but strength;" and having thus delivered his opinion with considerable emphasis, he left the room. 
                  "Ruth, come here," whispered her foster-mother, holding a small pocket-book in her trembling hand, from which she extracted several small pieces of postal currency. 
                  Ruth stood by her side. 
                  "How much is this, daughter?" 
                  "This? Let me see. It is-it is-let me see-ten cents." 
                  "How much is this?" showing another piece. 
                  "Five cents." 
                   
                  "And this?" 
                  "Five cents." 
                  Mrs. Armhold's hand began to tremble so strongly, that she could hardly retain the money between her fingers. 
                  "And how much is this, my daughter?" she continued, her quivering voice betraying a poorly-disguised agitation. 
                  "Ten cents, mother." 
                  Again the blind old lady opened her pocket-book. Her fingers nervously fumbled through its several layers. 
                  "And how much is this, my daughter?" 
                  "Fifty cents." 
                  "And this?' 
                  "Fifty cents." 
                  Mrs. Armhold felt easier. She feared she had lost them. 
                  "Daughter," she whispered into Ruth's ear, handing her the money just counted-one dollar and thirty cents-"go and purchase a bottle of good wine, that will not cost above a dollar. For the balance of the money get a loaf of bread and a pound of beef. Do you hear, my daughter?" 
                  Ruth, having replied in the affirmative, took a little basket and glided from the room. After a lapse of fifteen minutes she returned. 
                  "Mother," she said, "here I have the bread and beef. But the wine merchant told me that these fifty-cent pieces were counterfeit. He wouldn't let me have the wine." 
                  Mrs. Armhold turned pale. 
                  "Do you know who gave them to you, daughter?" she said in a faint voice. 
                  "Yes, mother. They were given to me in change by that rich grocer, who is building the large stone-front across the street. You know, it was a two-dollar note I had changed there." 
                  "Go, and return them to him." 
                  Ruth hesitated. 
                  "Why don't you go, my daughter?" 
                  "I have already been there," whispered Ruth. 
                  "And what did the grocer say?" 
                  "He said he had never given to me that money, and when I insisted that he had, he told me to clear out, or else he would take a broom-stick and apply it to my back." 
                  Perhaps it will not be improper to state that this grocer was a highly-esteemed gentleman, and had very liberally contributed toward the erection of a fashionable temple, and had promised to double his subscription provided it could be agreed upon to make the front of stone. It was decidedly his opinion that nothing less than a stone-front temple could do honor to Jehovah; and as it would be no less improper than unprofitable to disagree with the opinion of those who wield the scepter of gold, and live in stone-fronts, we have come to the conclusion of seconding every thing from that source, for fear the otherwise enraged authority would hurl its righteous wrath upon our poor head, declare us unfit for our position, accuse us of advocating dangerous doctrines, deprive us of its patronage, and, lastly, damn us for our presumption. 
                  We shall, therefore, not disagree with our grocer, who is both rich and pious. It must not astonish our readers if they always find us on the side of wealth, piety, and power against worth, common sense, and principles. 
                  What if he did refuse to take back the two counterfeit fifty-cent pieces from Ruth? It is too small a matter to waste one thought upon. 
                  Are you sure of it? 
                  Let us see. 
                  When Ruth had ceased speaking, she laid the bread and meat on the table, then returned to the side of her foster-mother in order to inquire what she should do next. 
                  "Boil the beef, daughter." 
                  Ruth knew how to cook. Young as she was, she had learned to cook. 
                  Mrs. Armhold rose to her feet, and bending her head over the sick couch, with tears trickling down the many wrinkles of her cheeks, addressed the invalid: 
                  "How do you feel, my love?" 
                  O, how strangely sweet and sorrowful were these words! The whole mother spoke through them. "How do you feel, my love?" Her lightless eyes were turned upon his pale, translucent face-they swam in tears. 
                  Edgar pressed a kiss upon his mother's lips-God! how he did love that mother-that deeply stricken mother! 
                  "Much better," he whispered. 
                  He lied! He had hardly strength enough to whisper. He was evidently in want of something strengthening-in want of a stimulant. He could not deceive his mother. She read in his voice the true state of his health. 
                  "You shall shortly have some soup, my son," she whispered in his ear; then turning around, gave some direction to Ruth; after which she left the room. During all this time Emil Armhold had been seated by the side of the sick couch. His head was uncovered, and his silver hair fell loosely over his pale, serene brow. His eyes had not been withdrawn for one moment from his favorite boy. Now he arose from his seat. It took him a considerable time to erect his figure, but when it was erected, it reminded you of the majesty of man, clothed in the royal garb of honorable old age. He extended his broad hand to his son, and gazed at him with an eloquence that beggars description. There were no tears in his black eyes, and yet they appeared soft and mellow as if a melting process were going on in their unfathomable jetty depths. Not for a moment did he withdraw his look-his eyes spoke to his boy-to his gentle boy. 
                  Ten long, long minutes he stood there, Edgar's small hand resting in his own broad 
                      
                        HANNAH PRESTON'S BIRTHDAY SOIREE. 
                     
                     
                      palm. He turned his head and found that his wife had not yet returned. His features began to wear an expression of uneasiness. He left the bed-side of his son, walked across the room and passed out of the door. 
                  His wife was seated on the top-most step of the almost perpendicular stairs. Her arms were resting upon her knees, and her face was buried in her hands. She was weeping. Poor, blind Mrs. Armhold was weeping. She was thinking of her Edgar who was sick-very sick-though he endeavored to conceal it from her. "O, how wretched she felt! She called upon her dead mother-upon her dead father-and she imagined she saw them before her. "O, mother, mother!" she whispered, amid stifled sobs, "why was I ever born?" Bitter emotions overcame her; she shook her head in nervous agony, as if excessive pain would not suffer it to remain still. She did not recall to her mind the incessant griefs and sorrows she had experienced from the time of her marriage to this hour-she did not recall them-no, not a single incident. And yet the pangs she now felt contained all the ingredients each sad event had deposited in her heart. 
                  Emil Armhold looked upon her for some time before he approached to where she sat. Was that his own beloved wife? his once smiling and beautiful Rebecca? It was-it was. His heart melted at that sight, and tears glistened for a moment in the corners of his eyes, then fell down upon his snow-white heard. 
                  He noiselessly seated himself by her side, and took hold of her hand, raised it to his lips, and kissed it. She knew whose touch it was. She knew the touch of her helpless husband-it was the touch that in youth had thrilled her soul with ecstacy. 
                  "Emil!" she exclaimed in a suppressed voice, throwing her land arms around his neck, and burying her head upon his bosom, "our Edgar is dying." 
                  She could say nothing more, but she could still sob, and she did so. How could she get money to purchase a bottle of wine? She thought, and thought, and thought. 
                  "Emil, let us go in," she whispered, after a short pause, wiping the tears from her eyes. 
                  They went in. 
                  "Edgar sleeps," whispered Ruth, who was just coming toward them from the side of the invalid's bed. 
                  The old man slowly crossed the room, and took his seat by the fire. A few minutes later his eyes were closed-he was in a torpor from which it would have been difficult to wake him. 
                  "Ruth, hand me the little mahogany box from under the desk," said Mrs. Armhold. 
                  Rebecca left the room with it, closed the door behind her, and once more sat down on the top-most step. 
                  What was in that box? 
                  Relics of her happier days. Souvenirs from the friends of her childhood. Gifts of love from her parents. 
                  The dead mother's gold chain. 
                  She would have parted with life sooner than with that chain. Her mother had given it to her as a remembrancer. She had preserved it through all the vicissitudes of fortune. She had hungered and thirsted, and yet the monster "Want" had never been able to induce her to dispense with that token. 
                  She would dispose of it now. Edgar was sick and exhausted; the physician prescribed wine for him-he should have it-he must have it. 
                  She did not weep, and yet tears stood in her eyes. Now and then one would roll down her wrinkled cheeks in which a peculiar twitching evinced the irritability of her nerves. Her lips would move-then press together-as if something bitter had been swallowed, and had left its disagreeable taste upon her tongue. 
                  She inserted the small key-her hand trembled so much that she could scarely open the lock. At that moment the tears began freely to course down her cheeks. She suffered the box to rest upon her knees. Her face was buried in her hands. O! how fast the tears rolled from her eyes! And she began to sob. She could not longer repress those painful outbursts. She tremblingly took hold of the corner of her apron, and stuffed it in her toothless mouth. She feared the sobbing might be heard within the room. 
                  Again her hands were on the box. The key was turned, the lid flew open. She knew in what layer the chain had been deposited. Her fingers felt for it there. Why did her knees shake together and her hands tremble? 
                  The layer was empty-the chain had been purloined. Every nook and corner was examined by her fumbling fingers, and all save the sought-for article found. 
                  She leaped from her seat-intending to return to the room. Her whole body shook-her knees trembled, and her feet could scarcely sustain their burden. She turned around, unfortunately stepped upon the skirt of her dress, lost her foothold, and fell backward down the long and almost perpendicular stairs. Ruth, hearing the fall, ran from the room and down the stairs. 
                  A wild exclamation fell from her lips and pierced the air. 
                  Horror! Horror! Horror! 
                  Poor Mrs. Armhold lay there, stretched upon the floor. Blood oozed through her ears, nose and lips. Not a limb moved. 
                  "Mother! mother! O, my mother!" shrieked the agonized little girl. 
                  No answer. 
                  
                     Mrs. Armhold was dead.
                   
                  There were other tenants in the house-they had heard the fall, as well as Ruth's exclamation of horror. They hurried to the scene of this dreadful catastrophe, carried the bleeding corpse up stairs and laid it on the couch. Little Ruth was the picture of despair. She ran about the room as if she had grown mad. She pulled out her long hair, and in loud shrieks gave vent to her bitter feelings. 
                  Poor thing! what had she done to suffer so much? 
                  The noise awoke both Edgar and his father. 
                  Let us not describe that scene. The anguish of the surviving was too great-their suffering too heart-rending. We should not have tears enough to shed. It was a scene over which angels might have wept. 
                  The tenants of the house were poor, and therefore, kind hearted people. They remained with the afflicted mourners all day. On the same evening the remains of Mrs. Armhold was followed by them to their last resting place. 
                  Thus ended the life of one of the noblest heroines on earth. A good daughter-a good wife-a good mother. Her path had been strewn with thorns-her sky had been ever overelouded. Tears of blood had been wrung from her heart. And yet she had never murmured-never complained. 
                  She was an angel in disguise-there are many such. O, let us find them out, and bind up their wounds. It is so sweet to be good and loving. Come, let us reach out our hands and help our fallen brothers and sisters to rise! They, too, were once smiling babes; fond mothers looked down upon their dimpled cheeks with high hopes. They once were children, with bright eyes, smiling faces-now lost, lost, lost! Let us restore to them that smile of which we have robbed them. It is a sorry-sorry sight to see a human wreck. A being whose fondest hopes have been destroyed, whose whole life has been an incessant struggle with adverse fortune, whose heart has been broken. 
                  O, let our purses be more open-our gifts more free-our words less galling-our feelings more noble-our faces more smiling-our deeds less selfish-our thoughts more lofty-our love more true-our religion more pure! 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XVII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              O, Death! the poor man's dearest friend, 
                              The kindest and the best! 
                              Welcome the hour my aged limbs 
                              Are laid with thee at rest! 
                           
                         
                        BURNS. 
                      
                   
                  ON the following morning the physician called on Edgar. He found him out of bed, slowly pacing up and down the floor. His face was even paler than usual, and his eyes were, if possible, more sad and dreamy. But he felt stronger. He knew that he dared not let his spirit sink under this new trial. Were he to suffer his feelings to get the better of him, what would then become of his father and of his little foster-sister? 
                  He nobly stood the trial. He did not sacrifice the living for the dead. He consoled the mourners, thereby evincing his love for the living and his respect for the dead. 
                  Another trial awaited him. 
                  He had to leave his dwelling before sunset. He had promised his landlord to do so, and he would do it. It was rented to some one else, who would take possession of these rooms on the following morning. A small room in the third story of an old, dilapidated house two squares further off, and belonging to the same landlord, Edgar had leased for his family, at the rate of five dollars per month. A wood-sawyer had formerly lived in it, but he moved out of it; it was too poor for him. It was a small room, immediately under the roof, and had but one window. 
                  The landlord took Edgar for his tenant because he could obtain no other. 
                  This evening he had to move. In an hour all the furniture had been transferred into the new house. About sunset Edgar might have been seen leading his silver-haired father from his old home. Slowly did they proceed. The hoary mute had grown twenty years older in twenty-four hours. He had become a picture of perfect indifference. There was no longer any expression in his eyes-in his face. He dreamed, dreamed, dreamed. He no longer comprehended what was spoken to him. When Edgar had told him of his mother's death, he broke out in an unearthly shriek, and his white hairs seemed to erect themselves. A moment later his head drooped down upon his bosom, and his hands, too, fell down by his side. It was the final blow. Though he still lived, his mind had, undoubtedly, followed his faithful wife into another world. 
                  Portray to yourselves the feelings of Edgar-the sensitive Edgar. He neither wept nor sighed; his pale face grew only a little more transparent, and his eyes seemed to have grown larger and softer. 
                  In his new home little Ruth prepared the meals. She knew how to cook. Her blind foster-mother had taught the little girl of eight what our mothers don't learn their daughters of eighteen. To suspect a young lady of understanding the culinary art is questioning her good-breeding. 
                  Each morning Edgar washed and dressed his helpless father, gave him his breakfast, swept the room, and made the beds. O, how his heart wept at this new trial! His mother dead-the mother he had so fondly loved! And then his father-the good, good old man! What, O what would now become of him? Who would now attend to his wants? Who could supply the great gap which the ever-patient, ever-faithful Rebecca had filled? Little Ruth was a mere child in years. She was inadequate to the task; her strength would soon fail her. 
                  Yet Edgar wept not-complained not. 
                  From day to day he went out trying to find something to do. He found nothing to do; there was no work for him. The first of April eventually came, and with it an increase of trouble. The pay he had received for his poems, and which he had intended toward liquidating the monthly installment due Mr. Montgomery, had already been otherwise expended. 
                  "Ruth," he said, gently drawing her little hand in his, "take care of father. I shall be back soon." 
                  He went straight to Mr. Montgomery's house. 
                  "You have been sick, young man," were the first words with which the rich man accosted him, as Edgar, ghost-like, entered the library. 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  These words came like a faint breath. They trembled first on his thin, pale lips, then in the air. His eyes were turned toward the floor. Mr. Montgomery could not see them, but he saw his bowed form. It indicated a broken constitution. 
                  "I presume you have come to pay your installment?" said Mr. Montgomery, in a business-like voice, which, however, sounded harsh to Edgar. 
                  "No, sir-" 
                  O, how sadly this was uttered! 
                  "No, sir," he continued in the same strain, "I came to ask you for a few days' grace. I have been sick, sir-" 
                  He wanted to say more, but could not. Something threatened to choke him. It seemed to stick in his throat. He tried to swallow it down, but the more he tried the worse it got. 
                  Mr. Montgomery gazed at him, noticed his very pale cheeks, his sad, sad brow, his parched lips, and mournful eyes. 
                  "Young man," he said, "pay me whenever you can. I am in no hurry for the money. You need not make yourself uneasy about it. Pay me whenever you can-do you hear me?-whenever you can." 
                  This unlooked-for exhibition of generosity unmanned the world-forsaken Edgar. For a moment he looked as frigid as a piece of ice. He felt that his feelings were about to overpower him, and therefore gathered all his strength in bracing up his muscles and nerves in order to sustain his equanimity. Soon, however, his efforts relaxed, his features lost their rigid aspect, his bosom began to heave, his breast began to throb and expand, his eyes filled with tears, and, a moment later, he lay, like a child, at the feet of Mr. Montgomery, sobbing aloud. 
                  Reader, do not call this an effeminate weakness. When the heart is full, it will run over-and Edgar's heart was full. He had crammed all his sorrows into it. Not at home, not even before little Ruth, had he evinced a weakness. Even before her he could not have wept; might she not have observed it, and wept also? But now this expression of unlooked-for generosity unmanned him, and he gave way to his emotions, and suffered his surcharged heart to unburthen itself. Faster and faster flowed the tears, stronger and stronger heaved his bosom, and louder and louder became his sobs. Mr. Montgomery feared his visitor had suddenly fallen seriously ill. 
                  "Young man, you ought not to have left home in this plight. Come, let me help you to your feet, and then I shall call in the ladies, or the doctor, if you say so. Curse me! but you are sick." 
                  By this time Edgar had once more regained control over his over-wrought feelings. He hastily dried his tears and rose to his feet. Again his pale face wore its usual aspect of calmness. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery," he said, fully bending his large, dark eyes upon the generous man, "excuse me for my conduct. I have suffered much of late-" He could not finish the sentence; he would have fallen in tears again. He picked up his hat, shook Mr. Montgomery's hand, and took his departure. 
                  Having once more gained the street, he directed his steps homeward. As he was passing a show-window, a handsome pipe with a long stem attracted his attention. Five minutes later he had purchased it. He would present it to his stricken father, who had always been fond of nice pipes. Might not this one afford him some pleasure? Edgar hoped so, and had therefore spent the money cheerfully. He hurried home with a lighter heart than he had had for some time. This weeping had done him good, yet had he known what new sorrow awaited him at that home, his heart would have beat faster, and his feet would have been fleeter. 
                  No sooner had he entered the room than he hastened to the wooden arm-chair upon which the old man sat, his head erect, and his snow-white beard reposing on his bosom. 
                  He did not raise his head. 
                  Noiselessly the youth approached him. 
                  "Father, I have brought you a pipe-a nice, nice pipe. Look at it, father," gently pleaded Edgar, with a faint smile on his lips. 
                  The old man did not move-did not reply. 
                  Edgar waited a moment before he repeated: 
                  "Father, don't you like this pipe?" 
                  Still no answer. Edgar drew nearer. 
                  "Father!" 
                  The same result. Edgar took hold of the old man's hand, but quickly dropped it again. 
                  It was cold as ice! 
                  Emil Armhold had died during the absence of his son! 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER XVIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Love is a celestial harmony 
                              Of likely hearts, composed of stars' consent, 
                              Which join together in sweet sympathy, 
                              To work each other's joy and true content, 
                              Which they have harbored since their first descent, 
                              Out of their heavenly bowers, where they did see 
                              And know each other here beloved to be. 
                           
                         
                        SPENSER'S HYMN IN HONOR OF BEAUTY. 
                      
                   
                  On the same day and at the same hour that Edgar Armhold had returned from his visit to Mr. Montgomery, Miss Hannah, who with her parents and brother, now resided at the mansion of Mr. Hugh Harrington, was reclining on a small settee by the side of her cousin Carrie, in the latter's private apartment. The young maidens were holding each, a book in their small hands, over which their eyes were glancing. Once or twice Hannah raised her face, which was still pale and wearing a sad aspect, and cast a vague and unmeaning look toward the sky seen through the window. Then again she would mechanically lower it, and suffer her eyes absent-mindedly to glance over the book. 
                  A full half-hour passed in this manner, in which neither of the two young ladies evinced any particular desire for interrupting one another. Carrie, however, seemed at length to have grown weary of this occupation, for she closed and laid the book aside, at the same time turning her soft blue eyes upon her thoughtful cousin, who once more was looking vaguely through the window at the sky. 
                  "What in the world is the matter with you?" exclaimed Carrie in a silvery laugh, at the same time twining her arm around Miss Hannah's slender waist! "How pale and pensive you do look!" 
                  At this remark, Hannah's cheeks suffused with scarlet blushes. 
                  "What's the matter with you?" again exclaimed Carrie, who had noticed the blood mount to her cousin's face. "A moment ago your cheeks were as pale as ashes, and now-now they are redder than the reddest tulip." 
                  Hannah felt exceedingly embarrassed. She lowered her head over her bosom, and suffered her jeweled fingers to play with the leaves of her book. 
                  "You are embarrassed, Hannah. I can see it," said Carrie, placing her soft and dimpled little hands playfully under the other's beautifully rounded chin, raising her head and mischievously looking into her eyes. Come, tell me what you are thinking about. Don't deceive me, for I know what it is. Will you acknowledge it if I guess the truth? Will you? You are thinking of the stranger who saved you from the flames. Now, haven't I guessed it? Havn't I guessed it? Don't-don't deny it." 
                  Hannah was about to lower her face again, but Carrie once more placed her hand under the former's chin, and coquettishly shaking her head, said, laughingly: 
                  "No, you won't-no, you won't. Down with your book and up with your face, and answer me to the point, if you do not wish me to tease the very life out of you. Now, tell me, without any equivocation-were you not thinking of him?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  After she had said this, she suffered her eyes to rest for some minutes on Carrie's happy, glowing face. 
                  "I really believe you have fallen in love with him," said Carrie, jestingly. "Come, tell me-how does he look? Is he as handsome as Edgar Armhold?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "He is? Very well. I shall excuse you for loving him." 
                  "Carrie, you are a fool. Who said that I loved him?" replied Hannah, considerably piqued, lifting up her head in an attitude of pride, if not of disdain, and curling her thin lips. "I never told you that I loved or cared for him." And then after a short pause she added in a low key, "I should be pleased to know from what you may have drawn such strange inferences." 
                  "Well, my dearest, sweetest cousin," replied Carrie, laughing, "will you allow your passion to subside a little? I merely said this to tease you-I had no other motive. If I had thought thas so innocent a jest would offend you, believe me, I should sooner have remained silent, than have uttered it. Indeed. I should." 
                  "I am not angry, but I don't want you to make such foolish remarks in the future." 
                  "Well, I won't. Will this satisfy you?" replied Carrie, smiling, and drawing nearer to her cousin, upon whose lips she pressed an affectionate kiss, with this remark: "This for a truce. Now, let us speak of something else." 
                  "Of anything that pleases you." 
                  After a pause of a few seconds- 
                  "Hannah, you are in good health once more-" 
                  A faint smile hung over Miss Preston's lips as she replied, "Yes, cousin Carrie-what next?" 
                  "You gave me a promise some weeks since-I want it fulfilled now. Do you know to what I refer?" 
                  Hannah's cheeks changed color. First they turned red, then the blood rushed back to her heart, and left them ashy pale. 
                  "To what do you refer?" she said. 
                  Carrie gazed at her for a moment, and replied: 
                  "Let me repeat your own words: 'If I do not satisfy you in a week's time of Edgar Armhold's baseness, I shall then acknowledge to have wronged him, and, if desired by you, exert my influence in your behalf.' Hannah, these were you words. The time has expired. I want you now to give me proof of his baseness, or an acknowledgment of having wronged him." 
                   
                  Hannah felt as if a thunderbolt had crushed her. 
                  "Carrie," she said, after a short pause, "since the time we spoke upon that subject I have discovered nothing for which he should be censured." 
                  "Thanks, thanks, a thousand thanks," exclaimed Carrie, joyfully, her eyes sparkling with unfeigned delight. "You do not know, no, you can not know, how happy these words have made me. I knew-my heart told me so-that you would discover nothing for which Edgar should be censured. I care not how much appearance may be against him-in his face he carries a passport of his innocence and purity, which my love for him has not failed to read correctly." 
                  "I wish," Hannah interrupted her, "you would not always speak to me about your love, and love, and love." 
                  "O, cousin dear," replied the other, in a voice appealing and tender, while her eyes grew mellower in their glances. "O, cousin dear, come, have patience with me; for the time may arrive when you will crave a similar boon of me. To whom should I open my heart if not to you? Are you not my own Hannah? Are we not as one body-as one mind? We are, we are-you know we are. Therefore let me speak-speak freely, for I am so happy. I love this Edgar, and day and night my thoughts are only of him. I am no longer what I was-I feel no longer as I once felt. It is no girlish fancy-it is the woman that speaks within me. Nothing delights me now. I have no pleasure to read, to write, to walk. I care for nothing save Edgar; for only in him I seem to live. He has conquered me; he has subdued and made me his slave. And is this love? And are we then so weak as to lose ourselves in one single passion? O, Hannah! I know you think me raving, for you do not yet understand the mighty change love makes in the female heart. It kindles a flame in our bosoms which we must let burn, for it can not be quenched. Yes, it would be futile to strive against it. It is all-powerful-all-mighty. It makes all other passions subservient to its will, and employs them to gain its object. I know it-feel the truth of it. What would I not do for Edgar-my Edgar? What and whom would I spare, coming between him and me?" 
                  As she said this she rose from her seat, and in irregular strides paced up and down the room. Her large blue eyes glistened-her heaving bosom rose and fell in quick succession, and her beautiful rounded cheeks glowed crimson. Hannah watched her cousin carefully, and her face grew paler, her brow more thoughtful, and her look more steady. 
                  "Are you through with ranting?" she at length said, a bitter smile hovering around her lips. "One would suppose that you had known and loved Edgar Armhold for years. You astonish me, Carrie. You do not speak like a girl of your age. What have you or I to do with love? We don't know what it is, and, more than that, I, for one, don't care to know." 
                  Carrie returned to her seat by the side of her cousin, whose hand she affectionately placed in her own: 
                  "I am not in the drawing-room now-among strangers, or in society where it were policy so disguise my feelings. No, Hannah, I am here in my own room, by the side of an affectionate friend and cousin. Here I need not wear a mask. The fashionable daughter of the wealthy and aristocratic Mr. Hugh Harrington is here simply a girl of sixteen, endowed with the same feelings and passions that pervade the hearts of our sex alike. Why should I be too proud to acknowledge that I love? Is it a shame? Is it a sin? Is it wrong to love? I do not think so-I can not think so. Love must be part of heaven, for while it warms our hearts it makes us think of heaven. We feel as if we could no longer live without it; it is the better part of our existence-it is the very quintessence of earthly happiness. Without it joy would be no joy, happiness no happiness-our whole life a passing mockery. Therefore I love-love with my whole heart and soul, and with conscious pride acknowledge it. The woman who says she loves not-speaks falsely; for it is a woman's destiny to love. Let her hold her head as high as an empress, and deceive the world with her haughty bearing, still she must succumb to that power, and sooner or later acknowledge herself vanquished by it. Edgar Armhold has won my heart. Why should Carrie's pride withhold what Carrie's love has given? Miss Harrington, the proud and wealthy daughter of fashion, is lost in Miss Harrington, the woman; and the woman loves him. You have told me that he is poor, and a Jew. What care I for riches? Have I not enough for both? Does riches make the man? I think not. And what care I whether he be Jew or Gentile? He is created in the image of God, his Father; and who of us can boast of a higher lineage? I heed not the prejudices of the world-I heed not for what she may say. I love Edgar Armhold-I little care to conceal it. But tell me, Hannah, what has become of him? He has not been to see your father since you made your home with us?" 
                  For a moment Hannah evinced a slight embarrassment; for her cheeks blanched and her eyes were lowered to the ground. Soon, however, she suppressed that feeling, and, with her usual self-composure, replied: 
                  "Mr. Armhold is no longer in father's employ." 
                  "You jest, cousin Hannah." 
                  "I don't." 
                  Carrie felt as if the lightning had struck her. She trembled from head to foot. 
                  "Hannah," she said, with a face from which every bid of color had departed, "are you serious?" 
                  "I am." 
                  Carries eyes became suffused with tears. 
                  "Is he dismissed?" she asked in an anxious, tremulous voice. 
                  "Yes." 
                  "At whose instigation?" 
                  "At mine." 
                  A pause of several minutes ensued, during which the two cousins gazed at each other as with a determination to read in the features the thoughts that were passing in each other's minds. 
                  "Has he wronged you?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Has he wronged your father?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Has he wronged any one of your family?" 
                  "No." 
                  "And still you instigated uncle to discharge him?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  Again their eyes met. 
                  "You don't love me, Hannah." 
                  Carrie walked over to the opposite side of the room, and began to weep. Hannah watched her for a short time, then rose to her feet and glided through the door. She hastened down the stairs. In the hall below she met her cousin Lionel. He had come from his mother's room, and was about leaving for the city. A frown wrinkled his forehead, and his eyes rolled restlessly in their sockets. 
                  "Where is Carrie?" 
                  "In her room." 
                  He hurried up the flight of stairs, and, a minute later, stood by the side of his weeping sister. 
                  "Carrie, is this your handwriting?" he commenced, in a clear, metallic voice, at the same time drawing a small sheet of note-paper from his pocket and exhibiting it before her eyes. 
                  It was. She recognized it. It was a note she had intended to send to Edgar Armhold. Her whole heart had been laid bare in it. Where, O where could he have found it? 
                  She almost sunk to the ground. 
                  "Lionel, let me have that paper." 
                  "Carrie!" 
                  There was something dreadful both in his voice and aspect. He was evidently laboring under the greatest excitement. His eyes flashed fire and his lips trembled. He grasped her by the arm, and then looked daggers at her. 
                  "Carrie, what does this letter mean?" 
                  "What right had you to read it?" she replied, with a just anger, at the same time trying to release her arm from his iron hold. 
                  "What does this mean?" 
                  Carrie feared to encounter his looks. 
                  "Nothing, brother." 
                  "Nothing!" he exclaimed, sarcastically laughing and biting his lips. 
                  "Pardon me-O, pardon me, brother!" and she fell weeping upon her knees. 
                  "Is this the first note you have addressed to him?" 
                  "Y-y-yes." 
                  "The truth-" 
                  "No." 
                  "Carrie, rise." 
                  She rose. 
                  "Has he ever answered your epistles?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Have you told him that you loved him?" he repeated, in a tone not to be mistaken. 
                  "I have, brother." 
                  It was said in a low voice. She dropped her head. 
                  "Carrie, you have disgraced our family. 
                  "O, brother!" 
                  "You have given your affections to a knave-to a cowardly thief-in one word, to a miserable, low-born Jew. Can you look into my face without blushing?" 
                  "O, brother!" 
                  "Do you think I shall suffer any man-and least of all this wretch, Edgar Armhold-to boast of his amours with Carrie Harrington? With my sister?" 
                  "O, brother!" 
                  "Do you think the world large enough to hold him and me?" 
                  "Spare him, brother-spare him! He is innocent. If there be any blame, the blame rests solely upon me." 
                  "If there be any blame! That's good-decidedly so!" and he laughed ironically. "I shall look for Edgar Armhold and demand an explanation. He shall give it to me; rest assured, Carrie, he shall give it to me!" 
                  "What would you do?" she whispered, tremulously. 
                  "Kill him!" 
                  It escaped through his gnashing teeth, and quivered on his lips like the low hiss of an angry serpent. 
                  "O, brother, spare him!" 
                  It fell upon deaf ears. Muttering some bitter imprecations, he released the arm of his sister and hastened from the room. 
                  We shall not follow him to the city for the present, but return to Hannah, who, after Lionel had left her, sought her father in her uncle's library." 
                  He was quite alone, and reading. 
                  "Father," she said, "you love your daughter Hannah?" 
                  "What a question!" he replied, smiling, as he gazed upon her pale, serene face. 
                  "My preserver has not yet come to claim his reward?" 
                  "Strange to say-no." 
                  "I have reason to believe he is poor and needy." 
                  "Well, why does he stay away? The reward is ready for him. I should more than cheerfully give it to him-to the preserver of your life. I can only account for his absence sence by supposing that he perished in the flames." 
                  Hannah's cheeks, pale before, now assumed the stark, rigid aspect of death. 
                  "I hope not," she whispered, after a short pause. 
                  "I can't think what else should keep him away." 
                  "Pride, father." 
                  He shook his head dubiously. 
                  "Father," she continued, "let me have a thousand dollars." 
                  "A thousand dollars!" he exclaimed, astonished at this request. "A thousand dollars, girl? What in the world can you want with a thousand dollars?" 
                  "To give to my preserver." 
                  "To give to your preserver?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Why, my daughter, where will you find him?" 
                  "I don't know; but I shall find him." 
                  "How?" 
                  "Leave that to me, father." 
                  "I shall not hesitate to give you a check for that purpose, daughter. If you discover your preserver, you may inform him that by calling at your father's, four thousand dollars more await him there." 
                  He wrote her a check for the stated amount. Hannah thanked him kindly, and then left his presence. 
                  A half-hour later a carriage might have been seen driving up to the house of Mr. Montgomery. The coachman rang the bell. It was answered by one of the servants of the house. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery lives here?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Please hand him this card." 
                  The servant retired for a moment. When he came back he informed the coachman that his master would be pleased to grant the request. 
                  The coachman returned to the carriage and opened its door. After whispering several words, he retired a few paces, when a young lady descended, who, with a queenly gait, crossed the pavement, and suffered the servant of the house to conduct her into the drawing room. 
                  It was Miss Hannah Preston. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XIX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              How beautiful is sorrow when 'tis dressed 
                              By virgin innocence! It makes 
                              Felicity in others seem deformed. 
                           
                         
                        SIR W. DAVENANT'S "LOVE AND HONOR." 
                      
                   
                  FOUR weeks after the occurrence of the circumstances just narrated, Edgar Armhold might have been seen once more in the library of Mr. Montgomery, engaged in a low conversation with that gentleman. Quite a change was perceptible both in his looks and demeanor. Those who had seen him only during the time that intervened between his dismissal from the service of Mr. Preston and his father's death, would scarcely have recognized him. Then, inexpressed and inexpressible grief and sorrow had oppressed his soul-weighed down his spirit-gnawed on his youthful heart-bowed low his figure, and had written, in tears of anguish, an index to his thoughts upon the lineaments of his face. Now, though his eyes still had that mellow and indescribable expression peculiar to the unfortunate-to those who from infancy up, through a long and weary life, have been doomed to drink from the cup of misery until they had drained it of its last dregs-to those who were destined to gaze at the smiling heavens that had, however, no smiles for them, from under the drooping branches of the weeping willow; now, though his lips were still lifeless and ashy, and the sound of his voice still grave and melancholy, yet the whole aspect of his face and figure-his looks, his gestures, his grief, his whole demeanor-evinced a state of mind which the reader of the human heart, poetically inclined, would at once have compared to the surface of the silver lake, seen at sunset, after a mighty storm had subsided and merged into a gentle calm, and all the winds had made a truce and died away. He was dressed in a new suit of black cloth, and around his hat, which he held under his arm, was wound, and on the left lapel of his coat was attached, black crape, the outer emblem of deep mourning. He was now standing, in a no less easy than graceful attitude, at a respectful distance from Mr. Montgomery, who sat before a small desk, with his face turned toward the visitor. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery," Edgar was just remarking, "I have taken the liberty to call upon you this day, not only for the purpose of paying the two installments now due, but also of thanking you-sincerely thanking you-for the great kindness you were pleased to show me on my previous visit to your house. Believe me, sir, I shall never forget the interest you have evinced for me on that occasion; and though my prayer is that you may never need the favors of any one, still I should consider that hour the happiest of my life in which my feeble efforts and humble service could be made conducive to your happiness and prosperity." 
                  This was said with that unstudied calmness, with that deliberation and pleasing intonation of voice in which, more than in aught else, the sweetness of his temper, his unsophisticated mind, and his respect for Mr. Montgomery, without forfeiting his own by an undue fawning, were exhibited. His pale face wore its habitually serene aspect. His raven hair was carelessly combed over his placid brow, and his eyes, with an open gaze, were resting upon the features of his creditor, who now laid down his pen, and, leaning back in his easy chair, replied: 
                   
                  "Young man, I don't recollect any kindness that I have shown you particularly entitling me to your thanks. However, be this as it may, I must confess to you-and I do it cheerfully-that I am no less pleased with your sincerity and deportment than I am with your honesty and punctuality. Sit down, Mr. Armhold, and lay aside your hat. What!" he continued, now for the first time observing the black crape-"what! are you in mourning? I hope you have not had the misfortune of losing any near relative.-Sit down, sit down; take this chair to the left of you; now, that's it." 
                  After Edgar was seated, he replied: 
                  "I have lately lost both my father and my mother." 
                  He lowered his head in order to conceal that tears that started to his eyes. A moment later those eyes were as dry as before-only they looked a little blacker, a little sadder. 
                  "I do not wish to deprive you of your valuable time, Mr. Montgomery," he continued, after a short pause. "Here are twenty dollars-ten dollars that were due on the first of April, and ten that will be due in a few days: on the first of May. Please see whether it is correct." So saying, he rose to his feet, and, advancing a few paces, laid twenty dollars on the desk. 
                  "Perhaps you are not aware, Mr. Armhold," commenced Mr. Montgomery, slowly picking up the money and handing it back to Edgar-"perhaps you are not aware that a thousand dollars were placed to your credit here, by a lady, shortly after you had left this house on the first of April. She told me that this money was yours, and that you would certainly call for it. I, of course, took it on deposit, expecting to notify you of it the first time I should see you." 
                  For a moment a faint smile hovered in the curves of Edgar's lips. 
                  "There is a slight error somewhere, I'm sure of it, Mr. Montgomery. I know of no one in the whole wide, wide world who owes me a farthing, or of one, especially of a lady, whose generosity should shower such wealth upon me. You have probably-positively-not heard the name aright. Excuse me, Mr. Montgomery, I'm sure you are mistaken." 
                  "But I'm not mistaken," replied the other, with considerable emphasis. "The young lady mentioned your name distinctly, and knew even of your arrangements with me, and that you would call on me that day. She knew all this; and when I told her that you had already been here, and that you were in very ill health, she turned pale as a corpse-almost fainted-and exhibited an unfeigned anxiety that led me to the belief you were no strangers to each other. She inquired where you lived, and as I could not tell her, she displayed in her countenance considerable disappointment, and expressed her regret in a faltering voice; she would so much have liked to meet you, she said. You perceive, now, that there is no misunderstanding-no error-no mistake. The thousand dollars are yours." 
                  The smile vanished from Edgar's lips; he lowered his head, and became pensive and thoughtful. A thousand dollars left here to his credit by a young lady! He could not comprehend it. Who could she be? What could have prompted her to so great a sacrifice of money? It was no contemptible sum. What girl had so great an amount at her disposal-or, having it at her disposal, would give it to him? To him, and for what? His cheeks changed color-became slightly flushed. He was thinking of Hannah Preston! Had he not saved her life? And had Mr. Preston not offered five thousand dollars to the preserver of his daughter's life? Edgar was perplexed; he mused for several minutes over this. Again he grew pale. He banished this idea from his mind. It could not be she-it could not be Hannah-no. How could she know any thing about his arrangements with Mr. Montgomery? Who could have told her of it? Nobody. He had never revealed it to a solitary being in the world; he had kept it a secret even from his parents. 
                  It perplexed him the more he thought and pondered over it. 
                  "Pardon me," he commenced, raising his face toward Mr. Montgomery, "did you say the lady was young?" 
                  "I did." 
                  "And knew of our arrangement-I mean of our agreement?" 
                  "She knew more than that." 
                  "More than that?" 
                  "Yes. She knew why Reuben committed that crime, and what his intentions were at the time. I must confess-though I shall never be able to pardon him for his assault on me-still, from what I have heard that young lady tell me, he is by no means so base as I have thought him to be." 
                  "Again I must ask your pardon. Have you ever spoken of this matter to any one?" 
                  "No; not even to my wife and children." 
                  "Strange," said Edgar to himself, musingly. "Who could have told her all this? Mother? No, no. She knew nothing of it." A moment later-"Perhaps it was Reuben; but what knew he of my agreement with Mr. Montgomery? And yet somebody must have revealed it. Strange, very strange!" 
                  He had lowered his head over his bosom; he now raised it and exhibited a serene and thoughtful brow. Once or twice he passed his nicely-tapered fingers through his raven locks, endeavoring to arrest by these movements his thoughts, which had grown vague and confused. His eyes were no less thoughtful than his brow, and were directed steadly-dreamily-toward the blue vault seen through the windows. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery," he said, at length, "I have no right to this money. I shall not accept cept one cent thereof. The lady will undoubtedly call on you again; if so, please return it to her." So saying, he arose from his seat and approached the desk. 
                  He placed twenty dollars-the two installments-upon it. 
                  "Please give me a receipt." 
                  "Young man," replied Mr. Montgomery, in a slow measured tone, "just put this money back into your pocket-book-will you? You don't owe me any thing, and had I known at the time of your brother's misstep what I have since learned from that young lady, I should not have suffered you to pay me one farthing. I shall also return you all such moneys as you have paid me on your brother's account, feeling that I have done wrong to hold you responsible for it." 
                  "Mr. Montgomery-" 
                  "Don't say one word-"and Edgar didn't say one word. In his eyes stood a big tear-that was all. "Don't say one word. Here, take the money. See, I had laid it aside and counted out for you." 
                  Edgar took it in his trembling hand, and put it into his pocket. 
                  "But tell me," continued Mr. Montgomery, "what shall I do with these thousand dollars? I tell you, Mr. Armhold, I do not like to keep this money here. The lady may not return-" 
                  "But she will return, if for nothing else but to inquire whether or not I have received it." 
                  "Young man, do me a favor-it is in your power." 
                  "With pleasure." 
                  "Take this money-you will sooner or later discover who gave it." 
                  Edgar hesitated a moment-he took it, however, with the remark that he should leave nothing undone to restore it to the generous donor. 
                  An hour later we find him at home-he was very pensive. Little Ruth sat by his side, but she did not disturb him. Could she not read in his face that something unusual troubled his mind? 
                  "Sister," he said, lowering his pale face and meeting her dark eyes, "sister, lay aside your knitting." 
                  She did as requested. 
                  "Sister, put on your new black dress. I shall want you to go somewhere with me." 
                  "Now?" 
                  "No, not until after we have had our dinner." 
                  "What do you want me to do for you?" 
                  "I shall tell you by and by." 
                  Little Ruth was satisfied. 
                  It was between the hours of two and three o'clock, when an omnibus, that ran regularly between Cincinnati and Clifton avenue, stopped at the outskirts of the latter place. A young man and a little girl, both attired in plain black, were seen leaving it. After they had turned away far enough not to be overheard by those still in the vehicle, the young man spoke for some time in whispers to the little girl he was leading by the hand. Several moments later they separated from each other, the former retiring a few paces, while the little girl passed several fashionable residences, until she at length entered a gate, passed over a nicely graveled walk that soon brought her before an imposing mansion, through the mahogany door of which a young gentleman was just issuing. The little girl raised her eyes to his handsome face, and timidly inquired of him whether or not Mr. Harrington lived in this house. Being answered in the affirmative, she ascended the few stiles and rung the bell, while the gentleman sauntered leisurly down the same path and through the same gate she had come, then turned into the direction that led to the city. 
                  We shall not follow him now, but precede the little girl in the house, in order to overhear a conversation between the two cousins, Hannah and Carrie-whom we find once more in the latter's private apartment. 
                  "Then you are not going to the city with me?" said Carrie, as she stood before the mirror complacently viewing herself in its reflection. 
                  "No, Carrie, I don't feel like going to the city." 
                  "O, come along-do come, just for my sake. I hate to go without you. You'll see we shall meet him to-day-something tells me we shall." 
                  "And suppose we should-" 
                  Carrie turned half round and gazed into her cousin's face for a moment, as if she doubted that from her lips these words could have escaped. 
                  "'And supposing we should?' O, Hannah, Hannah, how little do you dream of the wound this remark has inflicted on my loving heart! You know, I yearn to see him-that I have looked for him for weeks-have traversed every street-and all without success. You know all this, and still you say, 'and if we should?' Is this the way in which you intend to serve me in my love affairs?" 
                  "Carrie, I really don't know what you want of me. I'm sure if Edgar Armhold loves you, my services can be of very little use to you. He knows where you live-is aware of your mind-what more do you want?" 
                  "Nothing, Hannah. I see that I can little depend on you." 
                  "Carrie, you are ungenerous. You know that I would sooner die than refuse you a service." 
                  "Then come along with me-do, please," and she gently twined her arm around her cousin's waist and pressed a kiss upon her cheeks. "For aught you know, you may soon be in a similar predicament-love a young man who don't care a snap of his finger for you." 
                  "I'm sure I should be able to bear it with some equanimity, and not make a fool of myself as you have done for the last three or four weeks." 
                  Just then a servant entered, leading a little girl by the hand. It was the girl we have seen coming through the gate. No sooner had Hannah observed her than her whole face turned as red as a tulip. She evidently recognized the little stranger. 
                  Was that recognition mutual? 
                  It was-though they had met but once. 
                  "Carrie, I shall go any where-everywhere with you, but excuse me for this time. Will you? Say, yes-say, yes. I can not go with you to-day-indeed I can not," urged Hannah. 
                  She was interrupted by the servant, who drew a little nearer, saying: 
                  "Miss Hannah, this girl wishes to see you." 
                  "Well, I shall have to go by myself," said Carrie, once more looking into the mirror, then, followed by the servant, left the room. The door was hardly closed when Hannah jumped up from her seat, took the little girl by the hand, and asked her eagerly: 
                  "Is he well?" 
                  "Who?" 
                  A short pause. 
                  "Nobody!" 
                  She had already spoken too much-betrayed herself by her eagerness-her great anxiety. She would not do so again. 
                  "Nobody!" It was uttered in a clear, metallic voice. She was herself again,-cold, proud and haughty. Little Ruth looked at her calm, icy features, and felt a chill creep through her lithe frame. 
                  "What is it you want of me, girl?" 
                  "With a trembling hand, Ruth drew a little box from her pocket, and, without raising her eyes, gave it to Hannah. 
                  "What's this?" 
                  "I was ordered to deliver it to you." 
                  When Hannah took off the lid, her eyes rested upon a small slip of paper, on which the following lines were penned: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "Permit me to return to you the inclosed one thousand dollars. 
                              
                                 "Very respectfully, 
                                 "A STRANGER."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  For more than five minutes she gazed upon these lines. 
                  "Who sent you here?" 
                  "I have been instructed not to tell it." 
                  A few moments latter: 
                  "Have you ever seen me, girl?" 
                  Ruth raised her eyes at the pale beauty before her, and then replied: 
                  "I think I have!" 
                  "Where?" 
                  "At our house." 
                  "At your house?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  "Don't your eyes deceive you?" 
                  "I think not. It was when my mother and father lived-they are dead now;" and the little girl's eyes filled with tears. 
                  "Dead!" fell unconsciously from Hannah's lips. For the first time she observed that Ruth was clad in mourning. 
                  "Girl, return this money to him who requested its delivery to me. I have no claim upon it." 
                  "I must not take it back," she replied, and was about withdrawing, when Hannah, hastily rising from her seat, intercepted her. 
                  "This will not do. I'll have you play no tricks on me. Do you hear this?" she exclaimed, feigning harshness, and forcing the box that contained the money back into the little girl's hands. "Don't dare to leave or return with it again, else you shall be more severely treated!" 
                  So saying, she rung the tiny bell on the table, which was soon answered by her own servant, whom she instructed to conduct this girl to the gate-then return to her. 
                  Scarcely was the door closed behind them before Hannah returned to her seat, and, covering up her face with her handkerchief, began to weep. She had to be cruel only to be kind. Under that cold exterior lay a heart pervaded by the warmest impulses. 
                  "Follow this little girl," she enjoined upon her servant, who was again by her side-"follow this little girl-do not lose sight of her-trace her to the city, and return not to me until you have discovered where she lives. Now go." 
                  Again she was alone. She rose to her feet, and walked pensively up and down the apartment. Her heart was very-very heavy. She was sad-sad. She was thinking of Edgar's parents, whom she had seen but once, and again as she thought over their fate, tears started to her blue eyes and trickled down her cheeks. 
                  When she had become more composed, she descended a flight of stairs and sought her father's presence. 
                  Mr. Preston was reading the morning's issue, just left by the omnibus at his house, when his daughter approached him. 
                  "Father," she said, "I know of an orphan girl who has no home; adopt her, father." 
                  "Adopt her?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because your daughter's heart yearns for it." 
                  As she said this she lowered her head. A tear had stolen to her eyes. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              'Tis not too late to recant all this; 
                              And there is oft more glory in repenting 
                              Us of some errors, than never to have err'd. 
                           
                         
                        FOUNTAIN'S REWARDS OF VIRTUE. 
                      
                   
                  It was Mr. Lionel Harrington whom we have seen issuing from the house of his father as little Ruth was about to enter it. Having passed through the outer-gate, he slowly made his way down the street, but before he had gone a hundred paces he halted as if something unexpected had attracted his attention. He raised his head, steadily riveted his eyes on an object before him, then struck up a quicker pace, and, while a bitter smile began to curl his lips, hastened onward. Having reached the corner of the street, he turned to the right, and a moment later stood face to face with Edgar Armhold, who had been awaiting there unobserved, as he thought, the return of his little foster-sister. 
                  "What are you doing here?" commenced Lionel in an angry and threatening voice, at the same time clenching his fist. 
                  It will not be out of place here to remark that this was the first time he had met with Edgar Armhold since that interview with his sister, in which, as we are aware, he had indulged in rather unpleasant threats. Seeing now that Edgar retired a pace without venturing a reply, he once more repeated the question, simply adding thereto, "wretch" and-a curse. 
                  Edgar, as can be imagined, was taken by surprise, not only by the sudden and unexpected appearance of Hannah's cousin, but also by his strange and unwarranted behavior. At first he thought that Lionel was under the influence of liquor; but when he observed him closer and saw the malignant expression of his face-the wrinkles on his brow-the fire flashing from his eyes-he was at once undeceived, and knew that Lionel was laboring under the effects of anger. 
                  Not being aware of any cause for this conduct, and desirous to disabuse Lionel's mind, if it should harbor the idea that he (Edgar) in any manner offended him, he had thought to allow him first to cool down before he would answer, but finding his silence to have produced just the contrary effect, he raised his pale and pensive brow and suffered his dreamy eyes to rest for a moment on Lionel's face, after which he calmly remarked: 
                  "Mr. Harrington asks me what I am doing here. I shall cheerfully satisfy his curiosity, though I shall take the liberty to state, that, if he had deigned to meet me with greater civility, his question would have met with no less success. Mr. Harrington! I am simply awaiting here the arrival of one who is dear to me." 
                  He referred to Ruth-Lionel thought he had meant Carrie. 
                  The calmness with which Edgar uttered these remarks, made Lionel almost lose his little self-control. He could scarcely refrain from violently laying hold on Edgar. He shoved his hat back on his brow, then advanced a few paces, and, assuming a still more belligerent attitude, replied: 
                  "Then you are awaiting one who is dear to you?" 
                  "May I ask you for an explanation of this conduct toward me?-I hope Mr.-" 
                  "Hold your cursed tongue, you miserable wretch," sharply interrupted Lionel, gnashing his teeth and curling his lips. "You shall not deceive me-come tell me at once: Whom do you wait for? Whom do you expect here?" 
                  It can not be said that Edgar was alarmed, though he deemed it prudent to fall back a pace before he ventured upon a reply. 
                  "I hope Mr. Harrington is not confronting me in order to raise a difficulty. Having never entertained any ill-feeling toward you, I am ignorant in what I should have offended you so much as to have incensed you and raised your anger." 
                  This calmness of Edgar was more than Lionel could bear; it made him almost mad. He bit his lips in rage and clenched his fists still tighter. 
                  "You miserable puppy!" he hissed through his teeth. 
                  "Mr. Harrington-" 
                  "You abject knave-you crawling viper-whom do you wait for? Tell me, wretch, whom do you wait for?" and he was about to grasp Edgar by the collar, but the latter anticipated the move, and therefore fell back several paces before Lionel had had time to execute his design. 
                  "I trust you will depart, or suffer me to do so. I do not feel like quarreling, nor is my physical condition such that I should be able, were I even willing, successfully to defend myself." 
                  "Coward! black-hearted, white-livered poltroon!" hissed the other, at the same time throwing a contemptuous glance at the palefaced, though self-possessed youth before him. "Whom do you wait for!" 
                  Figuratively speaking-Edgar was pushed to the wall. He was compelled to meet the question and make himself ready for the consequences. 
                  "Rather than get into an altercation with you," he replied calmly, "I shall tell you I am waiting for my sister." 
                  As Lionel listened to this remark a contemptuous smile played around the corners of his mouth, and a bitter mocking laugh escaped through his lips. 
                  "Your sister-good!" he muttered between his teeth, while his eyes were wildly rolling in their sockets. "Your sister! Liar that you are-do you think to deceive me with this subterfuge?" 
                  "O, Mr. Harrington, suffer me to depart. I do not-do not feel like quarreling. You have asked me whom I was waiting for-and I have told you. What more can you want?" 
                  "You have told me a dastardly lie. I have a good mind to horsewhip you." 
                  The hot life-blood rushed to Edgar's cheeks and painted them crimson, and an unnatural fire began to light up his black eyes. He proudly raised his head and defiantly gazed at the rage-contorted features of his opponent. A moment later-the blood had rushed back to the heart, his cheeks had become pale as before, his eyes had lost their unnatural brilliancy and once more assumed a dreamy expression, and a faint smile-almost too faint to be perceived-hovered around his lips. 
                  Edgar was himself again. 
                  He thought of the apothegm, "Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage!"-and-he forbore. 
                  Gazing at Lionel, he said: 
                  "Believe me, Mr. Harrington, I have simply spoken the truth; why you should consider it a falsehood, I can not understand." 
                  "You can not?" a moment later-"Look here, Armhold, do you believe me so dull an ass as to suffer you to deceive me?" 
                  "I value my honor too highly to utter an untruth," and a blush of modest worth stole for a moment over Edgar's beautiful features. 
                  "This coolness surpasses every thing," Lionel muttered to himself, then added aloud, while he riveted his rage-glistening eyes upon Edgar's pensive brow-"You are here to meet my sister; you see I know the truth-if you value your life, do not deny it." 
                  At first Edgar felt like smiling, but the wild expression of his accuser's face caused him to pause and treat the subject more seriously. 
                  "Suffer me to disabuse your mind-" he commenced, but before he had time to utter another word, Lionel had griped him by the collar, and hissed through his teeth-"Confess, wretch, or I'll choke you to death. Acknowledge that you have come hither to meet my sister by appointment-acknowledge that you hold clandestine meetings with her-acknowledge that you love her-acknowledge-acknowledge-acknowledge it--damn it, acknowledge it, or I'll slay you." 
                  He ground his teeth together and raised his arm to strike Edgar. But the latter was not slow in discovering his intentions. At once Edgar's face assumed that fearless expression it had worn when he scaled the tree before Mr. Preston's burning mansion and made that desperate leap toward the window. Now he raised his head-a single jerk-and Lionel's hold upon his collar was lost. 
                  "Hold off!" said Edgar, falling back a pace, his face as pale as death. "I have been seriously ill-have no strength to combat with you-retire, or suffer me to do so." 
                  "Cowardly wretch," exclaimed the other, still more exasperated. "Here take this," and he plunged the blade of a knife, which he had held concealed under his coat, into Edgar's shoulder; then he turned partly around, and, with a sinister expression on his countenance, slowly retraced his steps. 
                  When he arrived, some five minutes later, before his father's door, he saw his sister coming down the gravel walk, while John the coachman, was standing on the pavement waiting for his young mistress, whom he was to drive to the city. 
                  At the front gate Lionel and Carrie met. No sooner had he noticed that she was about to leave than he turned his head toward John, and peremptorily ordered him to unhitch the horse and take him back to the stable. 
                  "Brother Lionel, what do you mean by countermanding my order?" Carrie said, by no means pleased with his interference.-"I desire to go to the city." Seeing that John was going to the stable, she added-"Well, I presume I may walk-you can't hinder me from doing that," and she wanted to pass him, but he placed himself before the gate and put his hand upon the latch, saying: 
                  "I want you to follow me to your room." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Cant you see that I am agitated? Come!" 
                  He said nothing more, but proceeded up the walk with his sister, who had grown pale as death and trembled like an aspen leaf. 
                  When they had reached the room they found it unoccupied. Hannah, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, had left it a few moments after little Ruth's departure. Lionel ordered his sister to be seated. In the mean time he locked the door. This frightened her, and she rushed forward in order to prevent it. 
                  "Sit down!" he exclaimed in a threatening voice, at the same time throwing his hat on the floor, and forcibly leading her back to a seat. "Now!" and his piercing eyes rested upon her pale beautiful face-"did you not promise me, that if I spared the life of Edgar Armhold you would have nothing more to do with him?" 
                  "I did, brother. O, do not look so angry-I have not seen, heard, nor written to him since-indeed, I have not, since I gave that promise;" and her soft blue eyes began to grow dim with tears. 
                  "Where were you going just now?" 
                  "To the city." 
                  "To the city-alone?" 
                  "Alone, brother." 
                  "Carrie, you're deceiving me." 
                  "As I love you, I speak the truth," she pleaded, now hiding her face in her hands, and beginning to sob aloud. 
                  "Carrie, you are lying. You had an appointment with Edgar Armhold-confess it, for I have seen and met him. Have I not told you I should kill him, if you persisted in your wickedness? Look at this knife! do you see these red drops? It is the blood of Edgar Armhold!" 
                  "You have surely not killed him?" she shrieked, horrified, rising to her feet and wildly glaring at the bloody blade her brother held up to her eyes. "You have not killed him? God! O, God! what has he done to you?" 
                  "What has he done to me?" he interrupted-"what has he done to me? Did he not love you? Did he not play with your affections? Did he not wait for you, just now, almost at the very doors of my father's in house?" 
                  "No, Lionel, no." 
                  "Carrie, this blade drank his blood-confess at once, or it shall also drink your own. What was that wretch doing in this neighborhood? Do no longer deceive me-you have duped me once, you shall not do so a second time." 
                  "Brother, brother," she sobbed, "if you were to kill me a thousand times, I should not be able to answer you. I had no appointment with Mr. Armhold-I knew not of his presence in this neighborhood." 
                  "Carrie, look into my face-wipe those tears from your eyes. Listen to me. You are my sister-your honor is my honor. A stain on your name is a stain on mine. You are only sixteen years old-you have no business with love; but if you must and will love, for God's sake, love any one but a coward and scoundrel. Let me never hear you speak of him again-Edgar Armhold is not the person worthy of a Harrington." 
                  And Lionel picked up his hat and left his sister's presence. In the hall he met Hannah, who had been in her father's library. 
                  "Hannah," he said to his fair cousin, suppressing his own feelings and assuming an air of liveliness for the occasion, "I have had some words with Carrie; she has taken them to heart, foolish girl, and is now weeping. Please, my cousin, chide her for this folly; help her to dry her tears, and impress upon her mind the impropriety of her conduct. Will you do this for me? I know you will. You will find her in her room." 
                  "Lionel, you should not have scolded your sister." 
                  "Nor have I done so. You know how dearly I love Carrie. Foolish girl that she is, if I remonstrate with her, she weeps; if I point out something that is reprehensible in her conduct, she weeps; if I admonish her with ever so much gentleness, why, she will have recourse to her tears. Nothing but tears, tears, tears, do what I will. Please, Hannah, chide her for it, and you may chide me in return!" 
                  So saying, he gently pressed his cousin's hand and left the house. It was late in the evening when he returned home again. Hannah was waiting for him at the house-door. 
                  "Cousin Lionel!" she said, as he approached, "when you have taken your supper, meet me here; I have something to tell you." 
                  "Can't you tell me now, cousin Hannah?" he asked, smiling. "I am a prey to curiosity. Come, tell me, what is it?" and he affectionately twined his arm around her slender waist, and conducted her half way up the hall. 
                  "Eat your supper first, then meet me here. Now leave me-go." 
                  Fifteen minutes later Lionel joined Hannah at the door. 
                  "Let us take a walk up and down the street," she said, as both passed along the graveled walk toward the outer gate. 
                  "As you wish, cousin Hannah," and he offered her his arm. "Now, what is it you want to tell me?" he continued. 
                  "Lionel, you have so often told me that you loved me," said Hannah, after a short pause, her head slightly bending forward, and her eyes cast upon the pavement. 
                  "You know that I love you better than life." 
                  "Prove it to me, Lionel," she continued, calmly. 
                  "How?" 
                  "By showing yourself worthy of it." 
                  "I hope I have always done so," he replied, slightly coloring. 
                  "You have not, Lionel." 
                  "I am sorry for it." 
                  "You have greatly wronged Edgar Armhold this day." 
                  "Pray do not speak of him, Hannah." 
                  "But I shall, Lionel. You have wronged him, and it is my wish that you ask his pardon." 
                  "His pardon? Never!" 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because I have not wronged him." 
                  "But you have, Lionel-wronged him as never one man wronged another. I, too, have done him injustice, and my heart weeps on that account." 
                  "I see, you speak in behalf of my sister, who is in love with that wretch." 
                  "He is not a wretch." 
                  "He is a miser and a coward." 
                  "You wrong him, Lionel. He is neither the one nor the other. Edgar Armhold has fully convinced me of his generosity and fearlessness." 
                  "I do not understand you, Hannah." 
                  "Do you think the man that rescued me from the flames a coward?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Do you think the man who refuses a reward of five thousand dollars a greedy miser?" 
                  "No." 
                  "This man is Edgar Armhold." 
                  For a moment Lionel gazed into his fair companion's face to see whether she were not jesting with him. 
                  "Impossible!" he exclaimed, scarcely believing his own senses. "He would be the last man on earth to risk his life for that of another. Have I not called him 'coward' in his face this very day, and has he had the courage to resent it? No! like a craven poltroon he swallowed every word I said, and pleaded illness, severe illness as an excuse for not resenting the insult." 
                  "And still you struck him-even after he had acknowledged to you that he was sick and feeble?" 
                  "I know it was but a subterfuge by which he wanted to escape my wrath." 
                  "And still you struck him?" 
                  "I could no longer control myself." 
                  "And he looked pale?" 
                  "As all cowards do." 
                  "Lionel, we have been mistaken in his character; believe me, we have. He is both brave and fearless, and therefore I want you to acknowledge to him that you have wronged him." 
                  "Hannah," said Lionel, "I really do not know what to think of you this evening. You, who to some extent have taught me to despise this Edgar Armhold-you, who even have felt insulted at his recognizing you-you, through whose instrumentality he was dismissed from your father's service-you now, from his most unrelenting accuser, become at once his advocate. Come, tell me, cousin Hannah, why this sudden change?" 
                  "Has he not saved my life?" 
                  "Are you sure it was he?" 
                  "Did I not see his face? Did I not hear his voice?" 
                  "Why have you concealed this fact?" 
                  "Because-" 
                  And they walked along in silence for some time. 
                  "Well, if Edgar Armhold has saved your life, Hannah," commenced Lionel, after a pause of several minutes, "why in the deuce don't he come after his reward?" 
                  "Because he is too proud." 
                  After musing a little, Lionel replied: 
                  "O, no, he is not proud-I'm sure of that. That fellow is rich-that's it-he is rich. I never saw a Jew that hadn't money. Rest assured, he is rich, despite the appearances against such a supposition." 
                  "Edgar Armhold is poor-very poor. I have it from the best authority; and, if you promise to be secret, I will acquaint you with some facts that will change your opinion in regard to the character and condition of Mr. Armhold." 
                  "You need not enjoin secrecy twice upon me: I pledge my word that what now you confide to me shall be held sacred as I would hold my sister's honor." 
                  Thus assured, Hannah commenced to narrate, while they slowly promenaded up and down the street, every thing connected with the history of Edgar Armhold, and how she had come in possession of it, only omitting-for she was ashamed to own her weakness-that some of the information she had gained was by spying into his private journal. After she had completed her narration, she added: 
                  "Cousin Lionel, do you understand, now, why Edgar Armhold was here this day?" 
                  "I do, and feel the greatest regret for my whole conduct toward him." 
                  They were interrupted by Newton and Carrie, who now joined them, and a general conversation ensued. 
                  We have seen that Lionel had stabbed Edgar Armhold in the shoulder-blade. The knife, though small, had penetrated the flesh to the hilt. The movement was so sudden and unexpected that it had taken Edgar by surprise. For a moment his features writhed with pain-it was when Lionel drew the blade from the wound-but only for a moment. That pale face, those dreamy eyes, that fragile form, concealed a stoic's soul. He said nothing; he only gazed at the receding figure of Lionel; then, raising his face heavenward, a faint smile-almost too faint to be perceptible-stole over his features, giving them an expression of unearthly beauty. 
                  "Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage!" trembled on his lips, and a bright tear fell down his cheeks. He attempted to raise his arm to wipe it off. It was his left arm. He had forgotten the wound; the pain caused by the effort soon brought it back to his memory. He looked upon his hand-it was crimson. Blood had been oozing from the wound and rolling down his arm. A boy was just about to pass him. He called him to his side, begged him to pull off his (Edgar's) coat, and tie his handkerchief over the sore. The boy rendered the required assistance with alacrity. He asked several questions as to the cause of the wound, but Edgar concealed the truth from him. 
                  "Any thing else?" asked the boy, after the bandage was applied. 
                  "Yes; please help me now to put on my coat and show me where I may find water to wash my hand." 
                  Five minutes later Edgar was again at his duty-waiting for his foster-sister. He had not long to wait. As we have seen, her audience with Hannah was a short one. When Ruth had come alongside of Edgar, he gently took hold of her hand and led her slowly toward the city. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              I did not shame 
                              To tell yon what I was, since my conversion 
                              So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am. 
                           
                         
                        SHAKSPEARE'S "AS YOU LIKE IT." 
                      
                   
                  ON the following morning Edgar Armhold might have been seen seated at his desk. His left arm, owing to the wound inflicted on the preceding evening, was resting in a sling. Before him lay his journal-the journal to which he confided his thoughts. He had been writing something in it, and was now perusing it. The pen was laid aside, and he slowly placed his elbow on the desk and rested his chin upon his hand. He raised his eyes from his journal, and directed them toward his little foster-sister, who was at the further end of the room, busy at washing dishes. At times she turned her face, and by so doing met his glance, which, though not disconcerting, had still the effect to embarrass her a little, for she would quickly cast her eyes to the floor, or upon the small table, and so continue her labor. Surely, if any one had asked her why she blushed and felt embarrassed at meeting Edgar's glance, she would no more have been capable of giving the reason than a girl of her age could have accurately defined her feelings. Nevertheless, Ruth did blush-did feel embarrassed. Was there something in the expression of Edgar's eyes-in their dark, unfathomable depths-in his gaze-that communicated with the heart of that little girl-a girl thirteen years his junior, and only seven years of age-creating a feeling, a sensation, an impression-unknown to her mind, not directed by her will-having its origin in neither, and yet affecting both? 
                  We shall not enter into a metaphysical discussion: our business for the present is to relate facts-stubborn facts, not their causes; and that Ruth had blushed and felt embarrassed, was a fact. 
                  Edgar, with all his penetration, could not read her features. Her feelings were as yet undeveloped-had not yet taken a precise form-hence, in their exterior manifestation, one could find expressed every thing or nothing. 
                  Again Edgar bent his eyes upon his journal. They rested on the lines he had indited that morning, and which ran as follows: 
                  "April 30.-At length my mind's at ease. No more hunger-no more starvation-no more anxiety-no more trouble. I sit in my room and at my desk, and suffer my thoughts to flow in verse. No one disturbs me; page after page I write, and page after page brings me nearer the completion of my labor. By night this essay will be finished. I shall take it to Mr. Clark and receive my pay. He has said that I have improved my style, and that by a little more study I shall eventually become an author of some note. But what care I for fame? I have no ambition. He has promised to purchase all my compositions, be they in prose or verse-and I am satisfied, for it banishes care. All I want, all I desire, is a home for Ruth and steady employment for myself, so I shall be enabled to support her and me. When shall I find that home for her? Poor, forsaken child! I weep for you-I weep for you! 
                  "What shall I do with these thousand dollars? Shall I keep them? No! The more I ponder over this matter, the more convinced do I feel that she bestowed them as part pay for the service I have rendered her. Who else could have given this money? It is plain-plain as day: it was Hannah. Has not Ruth recognized her as the lady who had visited my parents? Is it not probable that mother had confided part of our history to her? 
                  "Mother must have done so. It can not be otherwise. Hannah Preston has thought me a miser; she must be undeceived now. She has evidently learned of our poverty-hence this liberality. 
                  "Hannah Preston! this money shall be returned to you. Mother and father are now beyond earthly want; they sleep the sleep of life eternal. For their sake, what would I not have done? What would I not have sacrificed for their comfort? Have I not purloined my mother's chain, and pawned it, in order to pay their rent? 
                  "But what has become of the pawn-broker? I have searched for his office on every street. I shall make another effort today. If unsuccessful again, I shall give up the search in despair. I care not for my books; I care not for my vest; I care not for the four dollars and a half I left in that vest-pocket. I only care for my dead mother's chain which I pawned to him. I have promised to redeem it by the first of May. I have the money to do it with, but where is the broker?" 
                  When Edgar had read so far, he stopped and turned his head in a listening attitude. Some one had ascended the stairs, and was approaching the small door of his attic-room. A moment later a tap was heard. Edgar closed his private journal. 
                  "Come in," he said. 
                  The door opened. As Edgar looked into the face of the new-comer, he rose to his feet, and a deadly pallor spread over his cheeks. He advanced half way across the room, then halted. He straightened up his figure, and calmly looked into his visitor's face. 
                  He stood face to face with Lionel Harrington! 
                  For a moment neither spoke-they gazed at each other. The silence, however, was soon broken by the latter, who advanced one step, extended his right hand, and said, in a low, impressive tone: 
                  "Forgive me!" 
                  Edgar Armhold accepted the proffered hand, shook it affectionately, then led him to a seat, saying: 
                  "You are forgiven." 
                  "I have taken the liberty to call on you this morning," continued Lionel, "for the purpose of acknowledging to you my unpardonable offenses, and the shame and regret I feel for having committed them." 
                   
                  Edgar lowered his head, and a tear came to his eyes. 
                  "Do not speak of them," he said, in low accents; "they are forgiven and forgotten." 
                  "Edgar Armhold, I have acted meanly toward you; I have abused and insulted you; I have wounded your feelings, and caused you much, much misery. I have accused you wrongfully, and violently laid my hands on your person. I have branded you a coward, both privately and publicly-both to your face and behind your back. You have suffered all this, and more, at my hands. A mere apology will not suffice for these wrongs. Edgar Armhold I tell me how I shall make amends for the miseries I have caused you?" 
                  The sunbeams melt the ice; fire melts platina; kind words melt hearts of stone. Edgar's heart was not stone; it was soft and tender; a kind word could melt it. Before Lionel was half through speaking, it had melted away, and tears were in his eyes. He raised his head, and, as he did so, a sunbeam fell upon his pale face, lighting up its features with ethereal beauty, and giving them an expression of indescribable resignation and beatitude. 
                  "Mr. Harrington," fell from his thin, bloodless lips, "I am already too happy to ask for more." 
                  He was too much moved for many words. 
                  "No, no, Armhold-you see I don't mister you, and don't want you to mister me-I have done you wrong, and I am not satisfied until I have made every thing right again. You are a poor devil-now don't get offended at what I'm saying, because I don't mean any harm. What have I been saying? Yes, I remember. I know you have not the money piled up in bushels, although I was constantly thinking you had. Now, I want you to allow me to help you along; but-I don't know how. You see, there's no use for you to be bashful, for a clever fellow like you ought to have money." 
                  A mellow light shone in Edgar's dark eyes, and a faint smile rose to his pale cheeks and curled his lips. 
                  "Thank you, Mr. Harrington-" 
                  "Harrington or Lionel, if you please, but not Mister. Now, proceed, but leave the mister off." 
                  "No, no-" 
                  "I tell you, yes, yes. I won't listen to any thing else. What's the use of being so ceremonious with a friend?" 
                  "Since you insist," continued Edgar, "I shall take the liberty to address you henceforth as you desire me to do. I was about to thank you, Harrington, for your wish to render me pecuniary assistance. There was a time"-and here his eyes once more overflowed with tears-"when I should have been happy to have found a friend to extricate me from my embarrassment. Yes, there was a time I should have fallen upon my knees and blessed the being who would have loaned me as much as three dollars. That time is past-thank God, it is past." 
                  Edgar could not speak further. He was thinking about those good old parents whose lives had been a long, incessant struggle with adverse fortune. 
                  "Why, in the devil's name, did you not come to me?" Lionel remarked. "I should have helped you. But now-" 
                  "I fain would help myself. I have found employment, and hence can earn all we need. Still, I thank you for your offer. Yet, I should ask a favor of you, had I the assurance that the request would not offend you." 
                  "Armhold, don't waste so many words. Just tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it. Can I say more than that?" 
                  "No, Harrington. A moment later-" I should like to have you deliver to your cousin, Miss Preston-" 
                  "A thousand dollars. 
                  "How do you know? Who has told you?" inquired Edgar, astonished. 
                  "Who? Let me tell you: it was no other than Hannah herself. She told me all about it." 
                  "And will you take it back to her?" 
                  "No; as a matter of course I won't." 
                  "I have no need of this money," continued Edgar, "but if I had, I should not retain it." 
                  "Armhold, you are talking nonsense now. You know you must keep it. More than that, you must go along with me to uncle. He wants to see you on business, and I promised to bring you to him. You see, Hannah told him only last night that you had saved her life-he didn't know a word about it, no more than any of us, or you should have had your reward and thanks long before this." 
                  "When I saved Miss Hannah's life, I thought little of any reward." 
                  "We know all that. Your conduct has convinced us of it, hence your deserts are that much the greater. Armhold, get ready-you must go along with me." 
                  Edgar became somewhat embarrassed, and he lowered his head in order to conceal it from Lionel, who was sitting but a short distance from him, and had been looking into his face. 
                  "I can not imagine," he commenced, after a short pause, "upon what business Mr. Preston could possibly wish to see me. If it be for the purpose of rewarding me, believe me, Harrington, I should prefer staying at home, thereby preventing him from offering me a remuneration, which, if made, poor and humble as I am, my inclination, pride and duty would cause me to reject. It is simply on this account that I pray you now to cease urging me. I do not feel like going-I should not know what to say or do there." 
                  "You would not know what to say or do there?" replied Lionel, laughing. "Well, this is decidedly good. Why, Armhold! do 
                      
                        "WHERE IS EDGAR ARMHOLD?" 
                     
                     
                      you never make calls unless you have a set speech ready for the occasion? Come, get ready-no more nonsense. I don't know what business Mr. Preston may have to transact with you-nor do you. When we are once there, you will find out. So let us go." 
                  Edgar was undecided. Should he go or not? He reflected for a moment, and decided in the affirmative. He would go. He would take the thousand dollars with him, and return them to Hannah." 
                  "Harrington," he said, "I shall see Mr. Preston; but I can not make it convenient to go this morning. I shall, however, go out in the 'bus this afternoon, if you think that I can find him at home." 
                  "No, no; I tell you what you can do: you may go out with me at about two. Our carriage will be at the "City House" by that time. How will this arrangement suit you? You see, you will then have a chance to come back in the 'bus." 
                  "It suits me if it suits you." 
                  After a little more conversation, in which Lionel repeatedly expressed his regret for his past conduct, he left Edgar with the understanding that they should meet again at the City House. 
                  A little before two o'clock Edgar might have been seen entering the appointed place. He was attired in plain black, and still supported his left arm in a sling. Not finding Lionel in the hall or in the reading-room, he went back to the clerk, to inquire whether he had been there. Just then some one behind him gently tapped him on the right shoulder, and, as Edgar turned around, he stood face to face with Lionel, who seemed to have imbibed rather freely of liquor, for there was a sort of wild expression in his eyes, and his cheeks were flushed rather more than usual. 
                  "You are just in time," he commenced, in a vein of good humor, "just in time to dine with me. Now, no excuse; I can see in your face that you want to excuse yourself. But it won't work-it won't work, Armhold. You have to dine with me, unless you want to offend me, and I know you ain't determined upon that. So come along;" and without giving Edgar the least time to reply or remonstrate, Lionel hurried away with him, and a few moments later ushered him into the dining-room. They passed several tables, around which the guests were seated, and made there way up the centre of the hall, until they arrived at the further end, when they turned to the left and shortly after stopped in front of a table at which a lady sat, with her back toward them, who had just been ordering something from a waiter, who was turning around to leave when Lionel intercepted him, saying: 
                  "Where is your bill of fare?" 
                  In the mean time Edgar, who had advanced one or two paces, turned his face toward the table. The lady quickly raised her head, and their eyes met. Imagine the surprise of both, as they recognized each other. He fell back a pace, and the blood rushed to his cheeks. He bowed his head as a mark of respect, saying in a low accent: 
                  "Miss Harrington." 
                  She was about to rise to her feet, when Lionel, who had just got through ordering dinner, turned around and laughingly remarked: 
                  "Carrie, make room for Mr. Armhold and myself, for I've ordered a tremendous dinner for ourselves. I told the waiter to fill the whole bill of fare for us. You know that we get but one dinner a day, and that there are but seven days in a week-and as we dine here scarcely once a month, I thought I'd order for one dinner as much as others order for thirty." 
                  "Ain't you ashamed, brother Lionel?" said the laughing Carrie, raising her beautiful blue eyes coquettishly. "But I'll punish you for it. Never mind, I'll punish you for it. I'll never-never-never-never dine with you again. No, I won't-Mr. Armhold!" and she turned her lovely face toward him, "isn't it provoking to have such a brother, whose greatest delight is to torment his sister?" 
                  "And does he then delight in tormenting you, Miss Harrington?" 
                  The appearance of the waiter gave Lionel an excellent chance to change the conversation before his sister had time to shape a reply to Edgar's remark. 
                  "Why, you have forgotten the veal-cutlet!" he accosted the waiter. "You know I told you particularly not to forget the veal-cutlet. My friend here, and I, are particularly fond of that dish." 
                  "We are out of veal-cutlet," was the excuse. 
                  "Out of it? Out of veal-cutlet?" replied Lionel, helping himself to a slice of beef. "Well, bring us some fish." 
                  "We are out of fish." 
                  "Well, then, bring us mutton-chops." 
                  The waiter bowed and disappeared. 
                  "Armhold, have you ever eaten here before?" asked Lionel. 
                  "No, sir." 
                  "Well, then, let me give you a bit of advice; it may be of some benefit in the future. Whenever you dine here, or at any other fashionable hotel, don't forget to order the whole bill of fare-as I have done to-day, and for which my sweet sister here thought herself justified in chiding me-or else you will be compelled to leave the table with as empty a stomach as the man who feeds on smiles." 
                  The waiter, who had just returned, interrupted the conversation. He placed a couple of dishes on the table, then stationed himself behind Carrie's chair. 
                  "What's this?" exclaimed Lionel, drawing ing one of the plates towards him and inspecting its contents. "What's this? This is not mutton-chop." 
                  "No, sir; it's beef-steak." 
                  "Beef-steak! I did'nt order beef-steak. I told you to bring me mutton-chops." 
                  "We are out of mutton-chops." 
                  "Out, eh?" 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  Lionel turned half way around, and for several moments gazed inquiringly into the waiter's face. 
                  "Well, what have you, then?" he said, in a voice which, by no means, betrayed a remarkable degree of amiability. 
                  "Pigs' feet." 
                  "Pigs' feet?" Lionel rose from his chair. "Look here waiter," he said, "if you don't bring me something to eat, I'll break every bone in your body." 
                  The waiter was about withdrawing-Lionel called him back once more. 
                  "Has dessert been served yet?" he asked. 
                  "No, sir," replied the waiter. 
                  "Well, then, just serve us with some dessert. We shall be in time for that, at least." 
                  Five minutes later the unfortunate individual returned to our friends, who had been making merry over this affair and stated to them that no dessert would be served on that day, owing to the demise of a distinguished member of the culinary department. 
                  Carrie laughed aloud, and Edgar smiled. 
                  "Armhold," commenced Lionel, as all three rose from their seats "remember this as your first experience in a first-rate hotel; and all this on account of the Americans emulating the French system." 
                  They now left the dining-hall and proceeded to the reception-room, where Edgar and Carrie, at a short distance from each other took their seats. Lionel, however, said he would now look for John, and have him bring up the carriage, after which he left them. 
                  We have remarked before that Edgar had been surprised at the unexpected meeting with Miss Harrington, which feeling, however, soon had given way to one of embarrassment. Though neither from the lips of the one nor the other a single word had escaped to betray their respective feelings at this interview, yet the mute but unmistakable language of nature had not been silent during this time, but spoke through other mediums with a perspicuity and eloquence that would have shamed the best trained tongue. The peculiar conduct of Edgar, his-at moments-absent-mindedness, his downcast and evasive look, gave one a key to his mind, and Carrie's deep blushes, her frequent smiles, her laughing eyes, her twittering voice sweeter than the cooing of a dove, her restlessness-so peculiar to people in whose breast the loving soul is wildly leaping-her fond ogles-through these and a thousand other mediums spoke the ecstacy which this unexpected meeting had given her. 
                  As they now sat by each other few words passed between them, and strange as it may seem, Carrie, though she could not help noticing that Edgar carried his arm in a sling, never as much as referred to it. It did not surprise him. Why should it? Could he not reasonably suppose that she knew of the whole affair, and of Lionel's subsequent visit to his room, where an explanation had taken place between them? Could he not see in her looks that, though she kept silent upon that subject, he had alike her sympathy and love? Could he not have supposed and seen all this? 
                  We answer in the negative; you ask why, and we shall tell you. 
                  Edgar was not reflecting-he had not time to think, and he would have been afraid to think, had he even had time to do so. There are periods in a man's life in which he gathers up the strength of mind to look, so to speak, into himself, trying to keep the impression of what transpires around him from penetrating the seat of thought, from whence he would fain keep it banished. There are times when he is at war with himself-when he orders his will to scatter his thoughts and prevent them from impregnating definite ideas. 
                  Edgar was in that state of mind. 
                  When he had promised Lionel to accompany him home he was not apprised that Carrie was in the city, and would as a matter of course, be one of the party. Had he known that, he would have found some plausible excuse for postponing his visit. Now, it was too late. He was here, and the lady, who, with a censurable indiscreetness had betrayed to him the state of her mind and the feelings of her heart, sat by his side, her soft blue eyes fondly-O, how fondly!-scanning his features. As we have said before, he was afraid to think. What would be the consequence of this ride? Was it not probable that she might introduce a conversation and ask such questions as he could not answer in the affirmative, and dared not answer in the negative? No; it was possible, but not probable. Would not Lionel also be in the coach? And was she not acquainted with her brother's mind and temper? Knowing what had transpired yesterday, would she dare to give him a just cause for anger?" 
                  "No!" thought Edgar, and he felt less apprehension. But who can describe his feelings as, a few minutes later, Lionel appeared in the reception-room (still more under the influence of liquor), stating to Carrie and to Edgar, that he regretted the necessity of not being able to accompany them home, having just met a friend with whom he had business of importance to transact. 
                  A pallor spread over Edgar's features-a smile-a smile of triumph-across those of Carrie. She rose from her seat and merrily exclaimed: 
                  "Well, Mr. Armhold, haven't I a provoking brother?" then turning to Lionel: "never mind, never mind-I will never, never,-no, never go with you again;" and she placed her arm into Edgar's, and begged him, in a tittering, happy voice, to lead her from her mean brother's presence. 
                  A few minutes later, Edgar Armhold and Carrie Harrington sat side by side, in a coach that was rolling along Fourth street. 
                  It sealed their fate. 
                  Could they have penetrated the future, a chill would have crept through their frames and congealed the warm life-blood coursing through their veins. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              We sat and sighed, 
                              And looked upon each other and conceived 
                              Not what we ail'd; yet something we did all; 
                              And yet were well; and we were not well; 
                              And what was our disease we could not tell: 
                              Then would we kiss, then sigh, then look: And thus 
                              In that first garden of our simpleness, 
                              We spent our childhood. 
                           
                         
                        DANIEL'S "HYMEN'S TRIUMPH." 
                      
                   
                  IT has been frequently asserted-and who of us can not testify to the truth thereof?-that there is scarcely a human being on this wide globe, who does not wear, figuratively speaking, a mask, under which, be he old or young, learned or untaught, he continually screens his own individuality. Who of our readers will not admit, that we have never-never yet suffered our tongue, even in things of most trivial importance, precisely and exactly to reveal our whole mind? Who of us is not aware that we scarcely, if ever, utter a sentence that fully expresses all we think? Who of us is not aware that we-at times without knowing why-indulge always in a mental reservation-thinking a little more or a little less than we express? Can we not all, from experience, and by an investigation of our own inner selves, vouch for this? And do we not know that the organ of language is employed no less for the concealment than for the expression of our thoughts? 
                  Reader! we know this to be the fact. We seem to possess the faculty to give birth at one and the same time to two distinct trains of thought, by which the one becomes the agency of concealing the other. How often do we think of one thing, and thinkingly speak of another? How often does our mind's eye witness such a phenomenon? How often does that mind's eye-that peculiar intelligence that suffers us to see and direct by a mysterious agency our most intricate ideas-that intelligence which, with one will, expresses one thought while it conceals another, and likewise endows us with another thought, by and through which we can think over what we think and do-how often does that mind's eye watch such a phenomenon, while but part of ourselves escape from our lips, and from which part we judge and are judged by mankind? 
                  We profess to be partly acquainted with the characters of Miss Carrie Harrington and Mr. Edgar Armhold. We have learned from the preceding chapters the lively disposition and ready tongue of the one, and the calmness and self-possession of the other. But as they now sat side by side in the carriage rolling along Vine-street, Carrie was unusually quiet and Edgar unusually embarrassed. And yet nothing had transpired to have effected such a change. Judging by the few unimportant remarks that now and then, at irregular intervals, had escaped from their lips, it could easily be surmised that they had spoken merely to have spoken, while their thoughts were dwelling upon other themes. Edgar and Carrie possessed in an eminent degree the faculty of speaking well, but at the present moment it was most certainly neglected. However, as the carriage rolled on, and as one word brought on another, so, before they had reached Seventh-street, they found themselves engaged in a desultory conversation, which gradually became more connected and gave rise to that "small talk," in which people generally indulge who have no cares on their minds, or having them, would by this means conceal them. 
                  "O, isn't it a delightful day, Mr. Armhold!" Carrie exclaimed, after a pause of several moments, raising her beautiful blue eyes-not to the sky that could be seen through the open windows of the carriage, but to the serene face of Edgar, who had by this time once more regained his self-possession."O, isn't it delightful!" she repeated, with an enthusiasm which called the rose upon her cheeks and a sunbeam to her eyes, and she joyfully clapped her little white hands together. 
                  "It is delightful," said Edgar, shyly gazing at the happy, smiling beauty by his side. 
                  "O, how beautiful!" she exclaimed for the third time, almost rising to her feet, and one of those self-suppressed laughs that speaks so much of happiness, fell from her ruddy lips. A moment later Edgar lowered his head, and a blush stole o'er his cheeks. He became silent-he became pensive. What could have produced this change? They had certainly spoken nothing that could have caused the least embarrassment to either. Then Carrie also grew pensive, and her eyes vaguely looked through the window into the deep, deep blue sky. 
                  Her hand had glided into his, as if by accident. There it lay in his own, its tiny fingers now and then guilty of a soft pressure. Was it also accident that neither hand was withdrawn? 
                  "O, how delightful!" she faintly whispered, still looking at the deep blue sky, while her warm and feverish hand evinced a little more boldness, and fondly pressed the hand in which it had lain a willing captive. 
                  This time Edgar returned the soft pressure, and, as he did so, their eyes met. Their expression was soft and tender; they seemed to be melting-seemed to be swimming in tears. She moved up a little closer toward him, then fell languishingly back upon the seat. 
                  Not a syllable spoke they to one another. The carriage still rolled on, and still they felt the soft pressure of each other's hand. Now she turned her tearful eyes upon him, and a sigh of ecstacy-for there are such sighs-rose from her heaving bosom. 
                  "O, Edgar!" she said, softly, tenderly, sweetly, and a bright tear fell down her rosy cheeks. 
                  Edgar pressed her hand still more tightly, and for a moment their eyes met again. 
                  "O, Edgar!" it was scarcely audible. 
                  As if by mutual agreement and spontaneous feeling, they now inclined their heads until their lips met and felt each other's breath. 
                  "O, Edgar!" she laid her cheeks against his own, and began to weep with happiness, which sought its outlet through a shower of tears. 
                  The carriage stopped; they were at their journey's end. The coachman got down, turned the knob and opened the door. Edgar hastily dropped Carrie's hand, and, after having reached the pavement, assisted his fair companion from her seat, then, both turning around, passed through the iron gate, walked along the gravel path that led to the mansion, during which time Edgar did not speak a single word. He was evidently ashamed of his conduct-of a weakness that he had thought himself capable of subduing, but which, as we have seen in the preceding paragraphs, had gradually gained too sure a control over his feelings. As he now passed up the graveled walk, mechanically counting the small white pebbles at his feet, he mentally upbraided himself for his foolish yielding to a silly desire, and his mind became the theatre of bitter reflections and conflicting thoughts. His face had more than a pensive aspect. There seemed to be something severe in the sadness that hovered over his brow. Carrie observed it with poorly concealed apprehension. A severe pang shot through her frame and penetrated her heart. She could not keep her eyes from his face. The color left her cheeks, and her pulse began to grow weak and beat slowly. She had been guilty of an enormous wrong, she thought; had conducted herself unmaidenly, and now he despised her for it. O, why had she not restrained herself a little more-don't other girls love too-and don't they restrain themselves? With such thoughts she tormented herself as she preceded him up the few stiles. Having reached the uppermost stile, she placed her hand upon the knob, but, instead of opening the door, slowly turned around and, after catching the eyes of her moody companion, commenced in an anxious, low and half-suppressed voice: 
                  "Edgar-" 
                  A pause of a second ensued before she proceeded: 
                  "Edgar, you are angry; I can see you are angry." 
                  He only lowered his head a little; he could not bear her searching look. 
                  "Edgar, look up; please look up." 
                  She had thrown her whole soul into that "please." He could not resist the appeal. 
                  He raised his head and looked into her eyes. He saw tears in them. 
                  "Are you angry with me, Edgar?" she continued, in the same soft strain, her soft eyes swimming in tears, so fondly, so lovingly gazing into his own, while a faint smile-which said as much as "O, don't be angry!"-hovered around her beautifully drawn-up little mouth. 
                  "No," fell from Edgar's lips, in a low breath, after a short pause. 
                  As by magic, the whole aspect of Carrie's face changed. A smile, radiant as a sunbeam, overspread her dimpled cheeks, and her large eyes laughed-laughed with the ecstacy of her young soul. 
                  She turned the knob, the mahogany door flew open, and Carrie and Edgar-a sunbeam and a shadow-entered the hall. 
                  "Step into the drawing-room, please," she said to him; "I shall apprise uncle of your arrival." 
                  So saying, she turned around, but not until she had once more given him an unmistakable look of love; then, chanting part of a love-ditty, while her beautiful face was bathed in blushes, she danced, rather than walked, up the stairs. 
                  In the mean time, Edgar was making his way to the drawing-room she had pointed out to him. The door stood ajar. He pulled off his hat and looked in. He halted-it was occupied. A lady reclined on a small divan of purple velvet. Her head was gracefully bending over a small gilt-edged volume she was holding in her hand. She must have been deeply absorbed in what she was reading, not to have heard his approach. What should he do? Should he enter? For a moment he was undecided; but, while he thought over it, an incident determined him. 
                  A servant was passing through the hall. It would no longer do for Edgar to retain a stationary position before the door. It was evident he had either to leave or go in. He decided in favor of the latter. He gently tapped with his fingers against the framework. The lady, reclining on the divan, hastily raised her head and turned her eyes toward the door. When she saw Edgar Armhold, the book fell from her hands, and a death-like pallor spread over her face. 
                  It was Miss Hannah Preston! 
                  A feeling, partaking more of embarrassment than amazement, pervaded her heart. She had risen to her feet, and advanced a step or two, before she could in the least collect herself. But she could not speak-no, not one word escaped her lips. Something seemed to throttle her. All she could do was to look at him-and she did look at him. 
                  There-right before her eyes-he stood. O, how her heart ached within her! He was clothed in the deepest mourning, carrying his arm in a sling. His face was as sad, his brow as serene, and his eyes as dark, deep and dreamy as when she had seen him at her home, seated apart from all others, on her last birthday celebration. There he stood, with the same expression of sadness and humility as when she-O, how this thought now tortured her!-indignantly threw into his face his donated coin. 
                  She felt as if rooted to the ground, yet her features were undisturbed, giving her face an unusually severe aspect. In the mean time, she imagined the unfavorable impression this conduct was calculated to make upon his mind, and she became angry and provoked, which had the effect of giving her countenance a still severer aspect. Edgar, who had observed the embarrassment his presence had occasioned, at once commenced, in his usual unaffected voice of sweetness, to excuse himself. 
                  "Pardon me," he said, "for this intrusion, Miss Preston. I knew not of your presence here. With your leave, I shall retire again into the hall. I can wait there for your father. Excuse me." 
                  These words fell like a death-knell upon her ear. O, how much she would have given to have left a more favorable impression upon his mind! 
                  Look! he was retracing his steps-was already near the door. Could she let him depart thus? No! Her mind was made up. She would speak to him-she would undeceive him. 
                  He was already at the threshold, when her voice arrested his steps: 
                  "Mr. Armhold is not intruding," she said, without raising her eyes from the floor. "Let him be seated. Father, whom he undoubtedly desires to see, will shortly make his appearance." 
                  There was a freezing coldness, an unpleasant formality in these words, which did not escape Edgar's attention. However, his only reply was "Thank you," and he took the nearest seat. 
                  Hannah, as we have seen, intended, by addressing him, to remove the unfavorable impression she had left upon his mind. That she had failed to accomplish this, she was as painfully aware as if she had seen it written in his face. 
                  For nearly five minutes neither the one nor the other spoke a solitary word. Hannah had again taken up the book, but rather to conceal her embarrassment than to read. This silence, however, was exceedingly painful to her. "Why does he not speak?" she thought; "couldn't he commence a conversation?" 
                  No; it was her duty to begin. She was at home-not he. He had come to see only her father. And was her conduct not sufficient to discourage him? 
                  Yes. This silence, as we have said before, had grown exceedingly painful to Hannah. Her mind was made up: she would break it; she was determined to put an end to it. She would speak-say something, no matter what. Without looking up, and with her back partly turned to Edgar, she said, in a halfsuppressed voice: 
                  "Father will be down presently;" then was silent again. 
                  It was certainly a bad beginning, but, nevertheless, it was a beginning. It reminded Edgar of some business that he had to transact with Hannah before her father's arrival. 
                  The thousand dollars-he would give them back to her now; a better opportunity could not be offered him, and he would avail himself of it. 
                  He rose to his feet, and noiselessly approached her seat. The shadow of his form fell upon her book, but she did not raise her head-did not raise her eyes. 
                  She trembled as if an executioner had stationed himself beside her. Her face, however, wore a calm, rigid aspect. There was no color in her cheeks-or if there was, it resembled the shadow of white when seen through the pale light of the moon. 
                  "Miss Preston," Edgar now commenced, in his rich, musical voice, "suffer me to interrupt you for one moment, in order that I may return to you this money. When I had the good fortune to render you a slight service, I little thought of any other recompense than is afforded by the consciousness of simply having done my duty. I desire no pay-no, Miss Preston." 
                  So saying, he held out to her the roll of money that had been deposited for him at Mr. Montgomery's. Hannah did not look up; her eyes were still riveted on the book; though she imagined his sad brow reproving her for her distant bearing. 
                  Edgar advanced a pace, and, bending forward a little, laid the roll of money near her on the divan. She observed it. The money returned to her-and in this way-it was more than she could bear. Up she darted from her seat, and, before Edgar had had time to retire a step, she dashed by him and out of the room. He turned around, watched her graceful form until it disappeared in the hall, then seated himself again, not knowing what to think and make of this strange conduct. 
                  He was soon interrupted by the appearance of Mr. Preston. When he entered, supporting himself on a cane-for he still suffered with rheumatism-Edgar rose, politely litely bowing, then warmly shook the hand of his late employer, after which the usual greeting passed between them. 
                  Not desiring to weary our readers with the whole conversation that now passed between them, we shall suffer them to peep into Edgar's private journal, into which the following lines had been written by him shortly after he had arrived at his home, where little Ruth had been anxiously awaiting his return: 
                  "May 2.-What an eventful day this has been to me! This morning I had scarcely a friend in the world; now, now-O, how my heart beats at the thought!-not only I, but also my good foster-sister, have found friends-true friends-where we least expected to find them. And Hannah has told her father that I was the preserver of her life! How happy he was to see and thank me! How gently, how delicately-with what refinement and sensibility he broached the subject of remunerating me! What a difference between him and his daughter! He did not wish to offend me-to wound my feelings. He did not think it humiliating to be indebted to me-to poor Edgar Armhold-for a service rendered. He did not think it a disgrace to treat me with common courtesy. Is it a wonder that I shed tears when he approached me, with extended hands, saying, 'Armhold, you must not suffer false pride to bias your mind against this proposition? Henceforth my home shall be your home; not only yours, but also the little girl's: your foster-sister's. I will not offer you any money now. Hear me, Armhold, I consider you as one of us-as one of my family. You will be obliged to put up with considerable inconvenience for the present. When we move back to Avondale, you will find more comforts.' 
                  "O, how this kindness moved me! How my heart leaped within my bosom! A place of refuge-a home for my forlorn little sister! How happy-how happy I am! Ruth has found a home. Should I have suffered false pride to stand between her and happiness? 
                  "No! Pride is another name for false honor. I shall not listen to its voice. Why should I be ashamed of my dependence, when there is no such thing as independence? Ruth has a home. O, may the angel of peace hover over its roof, and guard and shield its inmates! 
                  "And I? Shall I dwell also in Mr. Preston's house? 
                  "No! This attic-room is good enough for me. Here will I pursue my studies; here will I court the muses. Here, at least, I shall not be pained to see the stern features of the haughty Hannah. Here I will think of my father-of my mother. They still live-they still see me-they are still my parents. I shall become good-aye, promise to become better-much better than I have been. The world may laugh at me, but it shall not discourage me. I shall be true to myself, and ever bear in mind that, do what we will, the progress of decomposition can not be stayed. I know I can not remain on earth: why should I barter all the future happiness for a little enjoyment here? 
                  "No, my father-my good, angelic mother-while here on earth, in this transitory abode, I shall ever look up to you, and under all vicissitudes of fortune bear in mind that 'Love is the greatest virtue, and forbearance the sublimest courage.'" 
                  We must not feel surprised in not finding in the above a single remark touching Edgar's interview and journey with Carrie. In his resolve to be good-to be better than he had been-he undoubtedly gives us to understand that he had been a transgressor; and though he omitted to speak of the transgression, it is scarcely possible that the exhibition of the weakness spoken of could so soon have escaped his memory. 
                  But let us return once more to Miss Hannah Preston. 
                  We have seen her leave the drawing-room. Haughtily, and with a face of the severest aspect, dashing by our young hero without uttering a syllable or deigning him a farewell look, she had passed into the hall and betaken herself to her own apartment. No sooner had she known herself alone and unperceived than she had thrown herself upon a divan, and, burying her face in her hands, had begun to weep aloud. 
                  A half-hour passed, and still the tears were rolling down her cheeks. O, what a change so short a time had wrought upon her face! It no longer wore an aspect of pride and severity; sadness and misery distorted every feature. 
                  Had she not left an unfavorable impression upon his mind? And had she not determined to show him her gratitude, esteem, friendship, whenever an opportunity should present itself? And had not an opportunity offered itself, and had she not suffered it to slip by not only without improving it, but, by her conduct, making the breach between them still greater? 
                  She had met him, had seen him, and what had been the consequence? 
                  A mutual understanding-a reconciliation? 
                  No! A further breach, and she knew it. 
                  It was this thought that now tormented her. How much had it been her desire to leave a favorable impression on Edgar's mind, and how utterly she had failed! 
                  She wept bitter, burning tears, and sorely reproached herself, until a noise of footfalls in the hall interrupted her remorseful train of thinking. 
                  Some one was evidently looking for her. She hastily dried her tears, picked up the novel she had brought with her from the drawing-room, and feigned to read. 
                  Just then Carrie bounded into the room, twined her arms around her cousin's neck, and affectionately pressed a kiss upon her lips. 
                  "O, Hannah, Hannah!" she joyfully exclaimed, while extreme happiness was written on every line of her blushing face, "he is here-he is here-O, he is here!" 
                  Hannah feigned not to understand her. 
                  "Who is here?" she said, indifferently, without raising her eyes from her book. 
                  "Who?" replied Carrie, astonished-"who? Why, Edgar Armhold, to be sure. Who else should be here?" she continued to rattle off, in a tittering voice. "Couldn't you read that on my face? Just let me tell you-" 
                  "I don't want to know any thing," interruptingly remarked Hannah, exhibiting a way wardness that rather increased the happy humor of her mischievous cousin, who now repeated, while a laugh escaped her ruddy lips: 
                  "Don't want to know any thing?" 
                  No." 
                  "No?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Nothing at all?" 
                  Hannah threw the book aside, rose to her feet and left the room, with Carrie's merry laugh ringing in her ear. 
                  In the hall she met Mr. Preston. 
                  "Father," she commenced, "did you give Mr. Armhold the five thousand dollars?" 
                  "He would not take it, daughter." 
                  "Father, you should have persuaded him." 
                  "I have done my best; he remained inflexible." 
                  "Will he make his home with us?" 
                  "No; but his sister will." 
                  "But not he?" 
                  "I could not induce him even to accept of his former situation." 
                  "Father!" 
                  "Daughter!" 
                  "Mr. Armhold saved my life." 
                  "I know it." 
                  "You owe him the worth of that life." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "It is your daughter's wish to see that debt liquidated." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "He has no home; insist upon his making our house his home. He will submit." 
                  "To please you, I shall try again." 
                  "Father!" 
                  "Daughter!" 
                  "Don't mention my name to him-never!" and, taking her father's arm, they went together into the garden. 
                  On the following morning, between the hours of nine and ten, Edgar Armhold and little Ruth stepped into the omnibus which carried its passengers to Clifton Avenue. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Blame not, if oft in melancholy mood 
                              This theme too far such fancy hath pursued 
                              And if the soul that with high hope should beat, 
                              Turns to the gloomy grave's unblest retreat. 
                           
                         
                        ROBERT SANDS. 
                      
                   
                  One year from the occurrence of the events mentioned in the last chapter we again meet with Edgar Armhold. It was evening. He was in the little attic room, seated before his desk upon which books, manuscripts, papers, pens, etc., were carelessly strewn. In his hand was an octavo volume on which his eyes rested scarcely long enough at one time to leave upon us the impression that he was taking the least interest in its contents. And, in fact, his thoughts were not on his reading. No. He was taking a retrospective view of the past. Alone-quite alone, in his attic chamber, everthing still, and noiseless around him, no one to disturb his meditation, he sat there, leaning languidly back on his chair, with his pensive eyes now on the book, now on the floor, and now again on the ceiling. There are moment in a man's life when he finds a sort of recreation in pausing awhile in order to arrest his thoughts and turn his eyes upon the pages of the continually receding past, and read their contents, though they be written in tears and blood. Slowly, but vividly, and one by one, the varied scenes of the bygone presented themselves to Edgar's mind. His childhood, spent in the quiet German village near the banks of the winding Neckar; the incessant strife between the father and mother: the former, sulky and quarrelsome; the latter gentle and forbearing; his own petty troubles with his twin brother Reuben; his emigration to America, his arrival in Cincinnati; his parents' increasing poverty; his father's declining health; his first attempt at making a support by peddling; his trip to Avondale, and his first meeting with Hannah Preston and Carrie Harrington; his brother's crimes; his mother's loss of sight, and the meekness with which she had borne her lot; her tragic death and that of her husband, and his own trials during these varied events, passed now like a sad, sad dream across his mind, giving his classic features an expression in which the gentle traits of his better self, made gentler by suffering, seemed blended into one of unearthly beauty. 
                  A tear came to his eyes, and slowly trickled down his pale cheeks; a sigh rose from his breast and escaped through his lips. A moment later he left his chair, laid the book aside, and walked up and down the room. 
                  Was he unhappy? No. Sadness is not unhappiness, and he was only sad. A year ago, when little Ruth, his foster-sister, had been taken by him to her new home, he had resolved in his mind to quietly pursue his studies, lead a life of seclusion, and seek happiness in making others happy. He had found a way to make a living. It had been by the use of the pen. Writing had become his profession, and, with his whole soul and mind, he had dedicated his time and talents to it. From morning until night he had sat by his desk, either writing or composing. He had but a few thoughts for the outer world; his whole mind was peopled with the creations of his own imagination, and he was content and happy in his retirement. Little had he dreamed of the reputation he was acquiring among his more particular friends and in other literary circles. Mr. Clark, who had purchased his writings, had not been slow in discovering Edgar's latent genius, and therefore had engaged him to compose a novel. When the proposition had been made, Edgar smiled at the idea. Reading a work of fiction, he knew, was quite a different thing from writing one. He had scarcely ever composed any thing in prose for the press-he had suffered his soul to flow in verse. Poetry had been his forte-his youth, feelings and temperament all had pointed to the muse of song: how could he risk his reputation in this new field of literature, and undertake to write a work of fiction? 
                  Only as we grow older we love to write in prose; and he had been only a little over twenty when Mr. Clark had broached the subject to him. It had taken great persuasion, and even then with great reluctance only, he had agreed to make an attempt. Soon after, it had been announced in Mr. Clark's "Weekly"-the paper to which Edgar had contributed his poems-that a novel from his pen would soon be published in its columns. 
                  So he had gone to work in earnest, writing a chapter regularly every week. Eventually the novel had made its appearance, the people had been delighted; had spoken highly of the author's talents, whom none had seemed to know personally. The few that had known him, with the exception of the Preston and Harrington families, had envied him, from their very hearts, the reputation he had, against his own will, and even without his knowledge, acquired. First they had laughed at his endeavors, as if they had been scarcely worth a serious thought, having denied him the slightest genius and originality. But, having found the current of popular opinion too strong against them, they had accused him of plagiarism, crediting every thing good to other sources; but when even this accusation could no longer be sustained, rather than to have given him his just dues, they had resorted, as little minds will do, to finding fault with his grammar, language, and other things against which they could vent their spleen. Now and then it had come to his ears, generally in a manner that was calculated to offend him most. How easily is a sensitive nature wounded? Whatcauses a mother to weep? Strike her weakly, infirm offspring. Whatcauses an author to grieve? Rob his feeblest efforts of the little merit they possess. 
                  Edgar had discovered, when it was too late, that the works of an author were public property, and that the author himself was not unfrequently dragged from his retirement against his own will, acquiring a prominence in the eyes of the world, which, however, flattering to the vain and ambitious, is by no means so desirable a thing as the uninitiated would suppose. 
                  How cheerfully would he have withdrawn his name! The critics, too, had begun to dissect his work of fiction, and were little sparing of the author's feelings. "What do they want of me?" he complained, as he would read at times some cutting remarks in reference to his efforts. "Why won't they let me enjoy my peace? I do not write for fame! Can't they suffer me to remain in my retirement, satisfied with myself and satisfied with the world?" Such thoughts had frequently recurred to his mind, and had it not been for the Prestons and Harringtons who appreciated his genius and encouraged him in his literary labors, he would have flung his pen aside and never more have written another line. 
                  As he now paced up and down the room, he gravely asked himself whether the world was justified in their attacks on his efforts; whether all authors had been made a target of by the ignorant and envious; whether it is general that the world will publish our shortcomings a thousand times sooner than our virtues? How it came that men even of acknowledged reputation and ability would reluctantly speak a word of praise or encouragement for those they see and know unjustly censured and attacked. "I will not be disheartened," he said to himself, "let them point out my faults and shortcomings, I shall be thankful to them for it." A few minutes later he seated himself again, and began to examine some manuscripts that were lying loosely on the desk. It was the last chapter of his novel; he had taken great pains with it, knowing the impression a bad winding up of a story leaves on the mind. Not having to deliver it before the following morning, and just being in a mood for it, besides being too early for his visit to Ruth to whom he still imparted lessons, he again began to look over the manuscripts in order to make such changes and corrections as his judgment deemed necessary. 
                  Not desiring to interrupt him in his occupation, we shall bid adieu to him for a brief time, and take a journey to Avondale, knock at the new mansion of Mr. Preston, and, having gained admittance, pass through the hall and corridor into the beautiful garden where, under a shady tree, two girls-one tall, fair and graceful, the other a mere child in years, from whose bright, olive tinted face a pair of large black eyes glistened-were carelessly reclining on the tall green grass. A sigh escaped through the thin lips of the former, when the little girl raised her head and gently taking hold of the other's hand, addressed her in words that were both sweet and mournful: 
                  "Why are you so sad, my sister Hannah? You look at the heaven and sigh, then shake your head and sigh again. You are not happy, good, kind sister Hannah. Let little Ruth share your grief; will you not, sister Hannah?" 
                  Miss Preston-for 'twas she to whom these tender words were addressed-turned her pale face toward the girl, whose hand she quickly dropped, and replied, almost harshly: 
                  "Why do you think me sad? I am not sad, nor am I unhappy. Don't you know it is naughty to watch one so closely?" 
                  The chastisement of the tongue is the severest to the sensitive, and little Ruth, from the peculiar circumstances in which she was placed, and which had surrounded her from the earliest infancy, was both timid and sensitive. The least harsh word would remind her of her loneliness, and cause her to shun the whole household, saying to herself: "I have no claim on their love; they do not care for me-why should I force myself into their presence?" While Hannah was still gazing on her, the blood rushed to her olive-tinted face, and an expression of timidity and shame rested on her features and glistened in her half-closed eyes. "Don't you know 'tis naughty to watch one so closely?" still rung in her ears and left upon her young mind the sad conviction of having been very rude. She would have asked forgiveness, but, child as she still was, she cowed so much under the cold, steady gaze of Hannah's eyes that she could not speak a word in her defense. Gradually she suffered her eyelids to fall over her eyes, and her head to droop, when a silence ensued which neither seemed inclined to break. 
                  "Ruth!" said Hannah after a short pause, in a voice betraying the gentlest feelings, "Ruth!" 
                  The little girl slowly raised her face. Her large black orbs were swimming in tears. She suffered them to rest for a moment on Hannah's pale brow. She saw that the severeness had departed from its features. 
                  "Miss Hannah! forgive me." 
                  She could scarcely say that much, but having said it she felt somewhat relieved, and she did her face in her hands and began to weep. 
                  "Ruth." 
                  There was something tender in Hannah's voice. Was she sorry for the harshness she had displayed? 
                  "Ruth?" 
                  "Miss Hannah!" sobbed the little girl through her hands. 
                  "Call me sister Hannah. Haven't I always told you to call me sister Hannah?" 
                  "O, I have no sister-I have no sister," exclaimed Ruth, the tears beginning to trickle through her fingers, and falling like bright dew-drops on the grass. 
                  Again Hannah's face began to wear an aspect of unusual severity. Every feature seemed to be chiseled in marble. 
                  "Leave me," she said with an air of authority, successfully concealing the violence she had done her feelings. 
                  As if stung by an adder, little Ruth arose from the grass and hurried, as fast as her feet could carry her and amid sobs and tears, from Hannah's presence. Instead of beating her retreat toward the house, she turned to the left, hastened down a narrow graveled path until she arrived before a weeping willow, at the foot of which she threw herself. Here she could cry and not be seen. Had any one passed she would scarcely have been discovered, for the gracefully bending branches, under which she was hidden, almost kissed the ground. 
                  Hannah's gaze had followed the little girl until she was out of sight, when she heaved a long sigh, and pensively looked into the blue space above her head. When she looked down again, tears were in her eyes. She wiped them off with a soft cambric handkerchief, and again breathed a long sigh. 
                  Hannah was sad-very sad. Something weighed heavily upon her mind. What was it? 
                  She was a bride-the bride of her cousin Lionel. He had asked for her hand some nine month since. Mr. Preston had given his consent, Mrs. Preston had given her consent, and so had-Hannah. Had she loved him? Yes, at least she had thought so then, but she knew she did not love him now. Did she love some one else? Perhaps, yes-perhaps, no; she did not know herself. Of one thing she was certain, however: the more she saw of Edgar the less she cared to see of Lionel. And in a short, short month her marriage was to be celebrated! She could not banish that thought for a moment. It continually hovered before her mind's eye like a pale phantom. "And am I to become the wife of one I do not-can not love?" she asked herself, shuddering at the terrible thought. "Am I then in so short a time to become miserable-miserable for all my life? Or, shall I be happier when once married? Shall I learn to be content and love him, or shall my feelings be still more estranged and finally grow into aversion?" She did not dare to answer herself. She knew her fate; it made her sad; but she did nothing to avert it. She would have been too proud to confide in any one, had she even found a person to whom she could have opened her heart. We have seen how she repelled little Ruth's sincere expression of sympathy-how she had denied being unhappy. She wanted to deceive even this little girl-even a child should not think her wretched-miserable. Ruth might pity her; a PRESTON did not want to be pitied. She would sooner die than know herself an object of commiseration miseration. It was on this account that she had been harsh to the little girl. To sympathize with Hannah was to offend her, and Ruth wanted to sympathize with her. 
                  When we are sad we are in a contemplative mood. We care little for other company than our own thoughts. We don't like to be disturbed-the least noise is an intrusion. The falling of a leaf disturbs our train of thinking. Hannah, however, was too deeply absorbed to hear any thing. Nearly an hour passed before she aroused herself from her reverie. She heaved a long sigh, and slowly passed the palm of her hand across her pale and pensive forehead. 
                  "Ruth!" she said in a gentle voice, turning her head toward the spot Ruth had occupied. Hannah had forgotten that the little girl was no longer by her side. Now she recollected again what had transpired. She imagined she could see the little girl weeping and sobbing. Her heart smote her for her harshness. Hannah had a good-a warm heart. She had, however, a strange way of showing it. Her aspect was often cold, distant and repelling, while the tenderest feelings swelled in her bosom. She loved Ruth. A sister could not have loved her better. When she had seen her weep and exclaim full of anguish, "I have no sister-I have no sister!" she could have wept, and in fact did weep, only the tears fell inside-upon her heart. She had felt, if possible, more wretched than little Ruth herself. 
                  The somber shades of evening had already thrown their gray folds over the garden when Hannah arose from the green sward to retire to the house. She walked slowly along the graveled path, with her eyes resting on and mechanically counting the little white pebbles scattered before her feet. 
                  A servant approached. Hannah raised her pale face and addressed her: 
                  "Is sister Ruth in the house?" 
                  "No, ma'am." 
                  Without replying, she turned to the left, and followed in the direction the little girl had previously taken. Hannah had often met and sat by her under that weeping willow. When Ruth was sad she would always seek that spot. It had become her shrine-her sanctuary. 
                  Hannah directed her feet thither. Having arrived in front of the willow, she noiselessly divided the branches. A last ray of the setting sun pierced through the opening, and fell like a mantle of gold over a slumbering girl. It was Ruth. She had retreated to her shrine, and had wept herself to sleep. Now Hannah approached her with a light step. For fifteen minutes she gazed down on the unconscious girl without moving-scarcely breathing. Her brow was calm and her face pale. It could scarcely be possible that those mild, mild features could assume an aspect of severity. Her beautiful blue eyes-there was something the matter with them; she could not keep the lids from closing over them-they were swimming in tears. She lowered her head, drew her handkerchief from her pocket and buried her face in it. For nearly fifteen minutes she stood there, weeping. When she looked up again, the last rays of the sun had already taken their leave, and the full moon was palely lighting up the serene face of the sleeping Ruth. Hannah silently watched her for some moments, and again tears started to her eyes. She drew a small ring from her finger. It was a valuable emerald, which Ruth had always admired on account of its beautiful, clear-green color. She tore out a leaf from a small memorandum, and placing it against the tree, the moon fully shining upon it, indited the following: 
                        "To My Little Sister Ruth: From Hannah."
                     
                   
                  The emerald was folded in the paper and dropped by the side of the sleeping girl, in a position which her eyes would scarcely fail to observe after awaking. Hannah then retired through the parted branches, pensively passed through the hall, and glided into the drawing-room, where all was still and dark. It had not yet been lighted up. She seated herself before the piano; her beautifully tapered fingers tripped lightly over the ivory keys. Her clear, silvery voice mingled with the deeper tones of the instrument. She had never played nor sung with more feeling. Her whole soul was in her voice. How sad-how very sad and mournful! It rung through the stilly air like the plaintive notes of the nightingale, watching, waiting for her truant mate's return. Was that Hannah-the proud and haughty Hannah? 
                  Ten, twenty, thirty minutes had passed, and still her mournful voice trembled in the air. Never before had she been in such a mood: she felt so sad and melancholy that her thoughts were entirely carried away by those feelings. Her songs were gems of a broken heart-weeping set to music. It grew darker and darker, and still she sat by the piano, forgetting the lateness of the hour. A light footfall by her side called her to herself. She looked around, and her eyes fell on a little girl kneeling at her feet. The light of the moon shone fully upon her face. She recognized her; it was little Ruth. 
                  "Sister Hannah!" said the little girl, in a subdued voice, her large black eyes calmly resting on the other's pale face; "sister Hannah!" 
                  Hannah extended her hand; Ruth raised it to her lips. 
                  "I have been naughty, sister Hannah," she said. "I promise never to offend again." 
                  "Rise." 
                  The little girl rose, and Hannah asked: 
                  "Will Edgar be here this evening?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  "Ruth!" 
                  "Sister Hannah." 
                   
                  "Edgar loves cousin Carrie!" and she suffered her fingers to run over the keys, as if she attached not the least importance to what she had said. 
                  "He loves us all," replied Ruth, innocently. 
                  "But Carrie most;" and again her fingers tripped over the keys. 
                  "I believe so." 
                  These three words had the power to arrest the movements of Hannah's fingers. They remained stationary on the keys. 
                  "He hates me," she said, after a short pause. 
                  Before Ruth had time to reply, a servant entered and lighted the chandelier, at the same time informing the little girl that Mr. Armhold was up stairs. 
                  "Has he asked for me?" she inquired. 
                  "He has." 
                  Ruth twined her arms around Hannah's neck, and, after pressing a kiss upon her lips, left the drawing-room, preceded by the servant. 
                  Hannah rose from her seat and advanced to the window. It was a beautiful night. The heavens were cloudless, the stars were bright and numerous, and the moon was at the full. Hannah walked out upon the balcony: it was deserted. This pleased her, for she was in no mood for company. She took a seat, and absent-mindedly gazed at the sky. The light of the moon fell upon her features. They wore their habitual calmness, only tinged with a heavier shade of sadness. 
                  Thirty minutes passed and still found her in the same position, wholly absorbed in reflection. She heaved a long sigh, and, as she did so, turned her head toward the door, against which leaned the lithe and graceful form of Edgar Armhold. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXIV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              I love thee, twilight! for the gleams impart 
                              Their dear, their dying influence to my heart, 
                              When o'er the harp of thought thy passing wind 
                              Awakens all the music of the mind, 
                              And joys and sorrow, as the spirit burns, 
                              And hope and memory sweep the chords by turns. 
                           
                         
                        MONTGOMERY'S "WORLD BEFORE THE FLOOD." 
                      
                   
                  NO sooner had Edgar become aware of having drawn upon himself the attention of Miss Hannah Preston, than he respectfully uncovered his head and slowly advanced toward her. 
                  "I hope Miss Preston," he continued, after the customary words of salutation had been interchanged, gently touching her hand, "will pardon me for having disturbed her in the sweet reverie in which I have found her indulging." 
                  "I shall grant your request simply on one condition," she replied, in a voice both sweet and subdued, while a faint smile flitted over her calm and pensive face. 
                  "And what is that condition?" he asked, seating himself by her side. 
                  "That you will give me your reasons for thinking the reverie in which I have been indulging a sweet one." 
                  "Most cheerfully." 
                  "Then let me hear you." 
                  Edgar gazed at her beautiful, very beautiful face for a second, then commenced in a voice, low, rich and musical: 
                  "Are you not beautiful, good, young and innocent? Are you not idolized by your parents-by your friends? And above all: are you not loving and beloved? Are you not a bride, soon to become a wife? A WIFE," he continued with more enthusiasm, gracefully shaking his raven locks behind his ears, "a WIFE-the proudest and loftiest position-next to that of 'mother'-attainable by the gentle sex? Are you not to become all this, and more? Why, then, should you not be happy, when the past has been to you a smiling season of uninterrupted bliss, and your future opens with the realization of a maiden's sweetest dreams and fondest hopes? Yes, yes, Miss Preston, you are-you must be happy, and all your thoughts tinged with the softest-with the mellowest twilight hue." 
                  He paused and suffered his eyes to rest upon the calm, pale features of Miss Hannah, who was gazing with an abstract air into the deep, deep azure. 
                  "You have reasoned well," she said, at length, lowering her head and slowly passing her hand across her thoughtful brow-"yes, you have reasoned well, Mr. Armhold: I am happy, for I am loving and beloved. But tell me, please," she continued, faintly smiling, "is my face so great a tell-tale as to reveal this feeling?" 
                  "No, Miss Preston," was the reply. "I scarcely would have arrived at that conclusion had I judged simply from the expression of your face." 
                  "What reason have you, then, for thinking me in love?" 
                  "Are you not a bride, Miss Preston? What other reason need I advance?" 
                  "Yes, yes, you are right," she remarked, absent-mindedly; "I am a bride." 
                  So saying, she raised her pale, sad face, suffering her eyes to rest on the round, white moon, slowly sailing in the deep, deep azure heaven. 
                  "Do all brides love, Mr. Armhold?" she inquired, after a pause of several minutes, still pensively gazing into the upper realm. 
                  "No, Miss Preston, not all," replied Edgar. "There are ladies who will bestow the hand without the heart; but you-" 
                  "But I?" she interrupted him. 
                  "But you, Miss Preston, would never have given the one without the other." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because you are too honest a lady." 
                   
                  "You have an exceedingly good opinion of me, Mr. Armhold," she lisped, a faint smile playing around her thin lips. 
                  "None better than you deserve." 
                  "You flatter me," she replied, in a subdued tone, lowering her head to conceal the scarlet Edgar's remark had called up on her cheeks. "I am harsh, and often rude," she continued; "and people affirm that, for the want of feeling, I am incapable of loving." 
                  "They do you wrong to say so." 
                  "Do you think so?" 
                  "Do I think so, Miss Preston? I know it." 
                  She raised her head heavenward, and, as the light of the moon fell upon her face, a bright tear might have been seen glistening in the soft blue of her eyes. 
                  "You may seem rude and harsh at times," he continued, his voice growing more modulated, "but you are not so. You have a true, a warm, a woman's heart, Miss Preston." 
                  "You do not know me. I'm not a good girl. I'm sure I don't know why you now tell me such things. I don't like to be flattered." 
                  "As I esteem you, I do not flatter." 
                  "Why do you say, then, I am not rude, when I know I am?" 
                  "O, Miss Preston, you are too, too good." 
                  A silence of several minutes ensued. 
                  "Even my friends say that I am feelingless," she said. 
                  "These friends do not understand you." 
                  "Do you?
                   
                  "Yes, in this particular." 
                  "And you say that I can love-that I have a heart?" she repeated. 
                  "I do; I know it." 
                  "I can love-I can love!" she whispered to herself, sadly nodding her head. 
                  After a short pause, she continued: 
                  "Mr. Armhold, what do you mean by 'love'?" 
                  "I scarcely know how to define it; yet by saying it is a feeling that makes one forget oneself in the existence of another, I believe to have conveyed something of its meaning." 
                  "To forget oneself in the existence of another!" murmured Hannah to herself, musingly, then said: 
                  "And don't you think me too selfish for this?" 
                  "O, Miss Preston, for the person whom you love, you would lay down your life, if demanded. I have had an opportunity to study your character, and, having availed myself of it, come now to this conclusion. I do not judge simply by your reserve, by your calm behavior, by your seeming indifference, and give a condemnatory verdict against you without a closer investigation. No, Miss Preston, no. You can love, you do love; though, for aught I know, your lips may never yet have betrayed it even to your betrothed. No, it is not he or she who exhibits most life and animation that loves the most. No, in sooth, it is not. Every human being, bearing a spark of heaven within his bosom, loves-simply with the difference that a strong mind keeps this passion locked in the heart, while a weak mind suffers it to escape in silly words and sillier acts. How often does a calm exterior, a pale face, a seeming indifference and want of animation, a reserve-aye, even a haughty bearing, hide a heart that, instead of being cold and feelingless, is nourished and pervaded by the tenderest love human nature is capable of sustaining, or of which our imagination, in its highest flights, can conceive! Does not a single glance of the eye confirm us in this opinion? Can we not read in it, at times-O, what tender, tender feelings!" 
                  Edgar said no more. All was still around him. He raised his dreamy eyes to the stars, toward which Hannah had been pensively and steadily gazing for some time. A bird-a tiny bird, perched in loneliness on a twig on some tree in the garden-now raised its soft, plaintive voice, and sent sweet music to their ears. Noiselessly and calmly they listened to the sad tale it had to tell, nor spoke they a word until the last echo of its clear and mournful voice had been wafted away on the wings of air. 
                  "How beautiful!" exclaimed Hannah. 
                  "Music is always beautiful, stealing upon us like a breath of heaven," said Edgar, a tear glistening in his eyes. "But what can be calculated to make us more sad and pensive than listening to the plaints of a loving heart in such a dark, stilly night as this?" 
                  "And do you think this bird in love?" 
                  "It sung too sweetly not to love, and too sadly to love happily. Love is the music of the heart, and is both born and buried in song. We give birth to it, laughing; we bury it, weeping." 
                  Again a pause of several minutes ensued. It was eventually broken by Edgar, who, perceiving the pensiveness of Hannah, feared having obtruded too long. 
                  "Perhaps you would prefer leaving the balcony, or remain here alone?" he inquired, rising from his seat. 
                  "No, no, Mr. Armhold. Stay-I do not yet wish to join the company up stairs;" then interrupting herself-"but perhaps you do. Yes, let us leave the balcony." 
                  "Not unless you wish it, Miss Preston." 
                  "Then let us stay a little longer. I confess that I am not in the slightest mood for going up stairs." 
                  Again they spoke of love and again the song of the bird rose into the air. Edgar grew more communicative, and whispered into Hannah's willing ears they earnings of his own lonely heart. How attentively she listened to every word! How she was carried away by his eloquence! How she sympathized with him! How she felt for him-with him! How chaste his feelings! How pure and elevated his thoughts! Tears stole to her eyes and trickled down her pale cheeks, but she knew it not. She had lost all her pride and haughtiness, and was drawn toward him by that link which unites the great to the great and the good to the good. He had been speaking to her of his own trials and forlornness, with a spirit so truly resigned and uncomplaining, that it enlisted all her feelings in his behalf. 
                  "Am I wearying you?" he said, at length. 
                  "No," she lisped, with lowered head, mechanically watching her tiny fingers playing with the lace of her cambric handkerchief. 
                  "You, Miss Preston," he continued, sadly, "can not know what a monotonous life is the life I lead-what I feel. You have many, many persons to love you; you are surrounded by them, and prosper in the sunshine of their affections. But I," and here his voice grew lower and sadder-"but I have no father to love me, no mother to love me, no brother to love me, no sister to love me-no, Miss Preston, none to love or care for me. Believe me, when I think of this, I yearn to close my eyes to this world, never more to open them." 
                  He paused for a moment, riveted those eyes on some bright shining star above his head, then continued: 
                  "What is fame or wealth to me? I have no ambition for either. O, give me a heart that can understand and love me, and I shall retire from the cold, cold world, and warm myself to life again in its mellow flame." 
                  Hannah turned her gaze upon him. His eyes were still raised heaven ward, and an expression of peace hovered over his pale, thoughtful brow. Love, purity, and resignation shone from those dark, dreamy orbs, and the regularity of his features lent a heavenly charm to his beautifully chiseled face. Hannah observed it, and, with a feeling of commiseration, transferred the likeness to her memory. 
                  "'Tis true," he continued, after a pause, "I love my brother Reuben, but he has left and forgotten me. And Ruth-my own little Ruth, my dear, dear foster-sister-will she not grow up to womanhood, and in the love for another-for the man who shall win her heart and hand-forget the attachment she now feels for Edgar Armhold?" 
                  He rose to his feet, and slowly paced up and down the balcony. He averted his face in order to conceal his emotion, but Hannah had caught his eyes, and discovered that they were swimming in tears. 
                  Without saying a word, she left her seat and went into the drawing-room. There she was met by little Ruth, who was in search of her foster-brother. 
                  "Ruth," said Hannah, "follow me." 
                  The little girl did as she was ordered. 
                  A moment later they were in Hannah's apartment. 
                  "Ruth!" 
                  "Sister!" 
                  "Will you do me a favor?" 
                  "O, sister, why ask me such a question?" 
                  Now Hannah took a small gilt-edged volume from her book-case. She opened it and extracted from between its leaves a beautifully-worked book-mark. It read, 
                        "BE HAPPY."
                     
                   
                  She folded it in a paper and gave it to Ruth, with the remark: 
                  "Mr. Armhold is on the balcony. Hand this to him." 
                  Little Ruth hastily withdrew, and ran down the flight of stairs. In the drawing-room she met Mr. Lionel Harrington; he had just come, and thought to find Hannah there. When he saw Ruth, he asked for his betrothed, and being informed where she could be found, begged the little girl to notify her of his presence. 
                  "After handing this to brother Edgar, who is on the balcony," she said, trying to pass him. 
                  "Never mind; I can give it to him. What is it?" 
                  "I don't know; sister Hannah is sending it to him;" and she transferred the paper into Lionel's hand, then hurried back. 
                  No sooner was she gone than he looked into it. A pallor spread across his face, and a sneer writhed his lips. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              He ended, and his words, replete with guile, 
                              Into her heart too easy entrance won. 
                           
                         
                        MILTON'S "PARADISE LOST." 
                      
                   
                  "Armhold," said Lionel, slowly advancing, "Hannah sends you this book-mark as a souvenir." 
                  Edgar was so deeply absorbed in thought when Lionel approached him, that he scarcely caught the meaning of the words addressed to him. 
                  "Good evening, Harrington," he said, rising to his feet and shaking his friend's hand. "You said something about a souvenir, I believe; I did not quite understand you. What is it you remarked, Harrington?" 
                  "I merely said that Hannah sends you a souvenir." 
                  "To me?" 
                  "To you, Edgar Armhold." 
                  "And Hannah sends it?" 
                  "Hannah Preston, my betrothed." 
                  Edgar took it in his hand and, followed by Lionel, hastened into the drawing-room. Here be unfolded the paper, and he suffered his eyes to rest for some moments on the words, "Be happy," after which he raised the book-mark to his lips and kissed it. 
                  "God bless you, Hannah," he exclaimed, "God bless you." 
                  He took the souvenir, once more folded it in the paper, then carefully placed it to his bosom. 
                   
                  "Harrington, she is an angel," he continued with that simplicity and artlessness so peculiar to his nature. 
                  Lionel was not particularly delighted with this praise. A pang of jealousy shot through his heart, and thoughts of uneasiness crossed his mind. He had not been entirely ignorant and unconscious of the change that had taken place in his bride's conduct toward him. Did he not perceive that she daily grew colder toward him? That she scarcely ever greeted him with that warmth and affection which he had a right to expect of one who was soon to become the sharer of his fortune? "And have I at last discovered," he now said unto himself, "the cause of her coolness? And has Edgar really supplanted me in her affection? And is this the reason why she requested me to postpone the marriage? Could Edgar have encouraged her? No, no. 'Tis scarcely probable. He loves Carrie and she loves him in return. I shall not accuse him of a baseness I know him to be incapable of." Now aloud: 
                  "Armhold, Hannah thinks a great deal of you." 
                  "O, she cannot think more of me than I do of her," was the reply. 
                  "You love her, then?" 
                  "How can you ask me such a question? Has she not been a sister to my sister-more than a sister to me?" 
                  "More than a sister to you?" repeated Lionel, changing color and biting his lips. "Yes, yes, you are right, Armhold. She thinks a great deal of you, and she makes no secret of it either. Do you know"-and he assumed a lively air-"do you know that I at times grow half jealous of you?" 
                  Edgar was too guileless and innocent to discover in this remark any thing more than a passing jest, and therefore shaped his reply in the same spirit. 
                  "You have good reasons to grow jealous of me," he said, smiling, "for Hannah and I understand one another. It is a lucky thing that you are to be married at the expiration of a month, for, you know, ladies are fickle-minded, and men are not to be trusted in affairs of the heart." 
                  Lionel did not feel at ease. Though he could not help thinking Edgar free from any desire to supplant him, yet he did not altogether relish these remarks. They certainly were not intended for offense, and yet they did offend. 
                  "Armhold, do you know that Hannah wants to postpone our marriage until Fall?" 
                  "Who should have told me of it?" 
                  "Yes, she wants to have it deferred until Fall. I should like to have your opinion as to what you would do were you in my position." 
                  "I would postpone it, Harrington. Rest assured, Hannah has reasons for it, though she may not have made you acquainted with them." 
                  "You think she has reasons? Do you?" said Lionel, thoughtfully, suffering his eyes to rest on the floor. 
                  "You know, Harrington," said Edgar, unconscious of the jealousy he was awakening in his friend's bosom, "you know one scarcely ever acts without some reason, and least of all would Hannah." 
                  "And least of all would Hannah? Yes, yes, you are right. And then you would postpone the marriage?" 
                  "Most certainly." 
                  "Most certainly-aha!" he repeated to himself. 
                  Just then a servant entered, requesting Edgar's presence in the library. 
                  He left Harrington after a few other remarks, and followed the servant into the library where Mr. Preston awaited him. In the mean time Hannah had descended the flight of stairs and made her way into the drawing-room. Her face was paler and severer than usual, and her lips trembled. She was evidently laboring under considerable excitement. She was angry. 
                  "Lionel," she commenced, little caring to conceal her feelings, "I do not thank you for your officiousness. Who called upon you to relieve Ruth from what I told her to do, and not you?" 
                  Lionel did not much like this greeting; he, however, restrained himself so far as to appear cool for the present. 
                  "I did not know," he said, particularly emphasizing every word, "that you wished to conceal it from me, or I should not have interfered." 
                  Hannah discovered the biting sarcasm of this remark. 
                  "You are now as impertinent as you were officious before. Lionel Harrington!" and she riveted her eyes on his face,-"Lionel Harrington! if you deem it necessary to place a spy over my actions, I deem it no less necessary to inform you that Hannah Preston is not the person calmly to submit to it. What right had you to take from Ruth-" 
                  "A souvenir for Edgar Armhold sent by you," he interrupted her. 
                  "Lionel Harrington!" she said haughtily, "I can never become the wife of a man who is base enough to suspect his bride of dishonesty. Hannah Preston would sooner die-yes, would sooner die than become such a man's wife." 
                  So saying she passed through the door without deigning him another look. He was confounded-her conduct at this interview convinced him beyond a doubt that he had done her injustice in having entertained the least suspicion in regard to her honesty. He felt assured that he had done her wrong in this particular. But what would he not have given to have been equally as much assured of still having a claim on her affections? In his torment an idea struck his mind. He thought of some means which could allay at once all his fears and uneasiness. He reflected over the feasibility of the conceived plan, and, as he did so, he regained his self-composure, and an expression of triumph hovered over his features. 
                  He also left the drawing-room. In the hall he met Edgar who was about to leave for Cincinnati. 
                  "Armhold," said Lionel, "you must stay with me to-night. In the morning we'll go to the city together. How did you come out here?" 
                  "Horseback." 
                  "So did I. It is pleasant to ride, the moon is up, and the air is fresh. Where is your horse?" 
                  "Before the gate," replied Edgar. 
                  "So is mine. Have you already said good-bye to all?' continued Lionel. "You have? Well, then, let us go. I shall say good-bye to them on the morrow-it will be time enough. Won't it?" and with a laugh he hurried Edgar along the hall, who, having no particular business in Cincinnati, accepted the invitation of his friend; for let it be remarked here, that from the morning the explanation had taken place between them, they had daily grown warmer friends. 
                  It was near ten o'clock when they rode up Clifton Avenue. In the house of Lionel's father all seemed to have gone to rest. All the lights had been extinguished. 
                  "Very little entertainment to be had here to-night, Armhold," said his companion, as they led their horses to the stable. "It appears to me the whole family have already gone to rest." 
                  "When we enter, Harrington, let us bear in mind, that no one likes to be aroused from his first slumber." 
                  "That's so, Armhold, and yet I would wager any amount that you could scarcely keep Carrie in bed now, were she apprised of your presence here. Do you know, Armhold," he continued in a confidential way, as they were walking back to the house together-"Do you know, Armhold, that I have, with considerable pleasure, watched for some time the growth of an attachment between Carrie and yourself? Now, don't blush, else I shall tell Carrie of your bashfulness, and she will tease you to death for it." 
                  So saying they entered the house, and fifteen minutes later they sat in Lionel's room before an opened window, through which the fresh air was entering. They smoked and talked, and talked and smoked until it struck twelve o'clock, when both retired. 
                  On the following morning, before the sun had risen, Lionel crept from his bed and hastily dressed himself. Having got through with this, he left the room, descended a flight of stairs, and entered the kitchen where some of the servants were already at their duty. 
                  "Go and see whether Carrie is up," he said to one of them, "and if she has not yet risen, tell her to do so at once, and meet me in the garden, where I shall wait for her." 
                  The servant went up-stairs, and Lionel sauntered into the garden. 
                  When, some minutes later, Carrie joined her brother, he told her to take his arm and pace up and down the several paths with him, while he would tell her something, which, he hoped, would be of sufficient interest to her to engage her whole attention. 
                  He now told her the events of the preceding evening as they had transpired at Preston's house, tinging them with the hue which a jealous eye like his would be likely to give them. 
                  "You see now how matters stand, Carrie," he continued, finding his sister unusually taciturn. "Edgar, unless you take greater pains to charm him than you have done heretofore, will be lost to you. I will not wrong Hannah so much as to say she is laboring to gain his affection; yet"-and here a frown crossed his brow-"yet, her manner of treating him is calculated to create an affection I should be grieved to discover." 
                  "You are not jealous, Lionel-are you?" she said, her head lowered groundward, and slowly pacing down the graveled path. 
                  "I don't know," he replied, after a short pause. "I don't know; at all events I should like you to dispel my fears." 
                  "Don't you think Hannah loves you?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Do you really think she loves Edgar?" 
                  "Yes, I do." 
                  "Do you think he loves her?" 
                  "I believe he does without knowing it." 
                  Again a silence of several minutes ensued. Carrie was the first to break it. 
                  "And Hannah wants her marriage-day postponed for a month?" she inquired, without looking up from the ground. 
                  "Carrie, I fear she now wants it postponed indefinitely; she as much as intimated that much to me.' 
                  "Lionel, I always suspected Hannah of loving Edgar." 
                  "You did? And why did you not tell me?" 
                  "Because I thought you would laugh at me, and say I was a jealous little fool. And, besides, Hannah was your bride-would it have been proper even to hint at such a thing?" 
                  Lionel bit his lips, and an angry ray shot from his eyes. 
                  "Carrie," he said, in a low, impressive voice, "this thing must be stopped. I neither suspect Hannah nor Edgar of any wrong; but who knows, if not discouraged at once, what the result of their mutual attachment may be?" 
                  "Did Edgar stay at Uncle's last night?" 
                  "No, Carrie, he came home with me, and is now at our house." 
                  Carrie raised her face, and a scarlet blush glowed on her cheeks. 
                   
                  "He is?" she heaved in a long breath. 
                  "Yes, and for this reason I have had you called." 
                  "What would you have me do, Lionel?" 
                  "Before speaking further upon this topic, I want you to answer me this question. Do you still love Edgar Armhold? I am your brother, Carrie-speak freely to me. Do you still love Edgar Armhold?" 
                  "Yes," she whispered, and again the scarlet mounted to her cheeks. 
                  "He shall be yours, Carrie; that is-if you will follow my instructions." 
                  Carrie remained silent and he continued: 
                  "Yes, he shall be yours, and you need not blush to become the wife of such a man. He has risen in the world, Carrie, and this day his literary reputation, as well as that of his conduct, is as great as the most ambitious could desire." 
                  Still Carrie was leaning on her brother's arm, and still she gazed upon the ground, without evincing the least desire to interrupt him in his conversation. Lionel, discovering how attentively she listened to his remarks, continued: 
                  "I want you to make a prize of him-I want you to gain his affection-his love, Carrie. But in order to be successful in this," and here he commenced to emphasize every word-"but in order to be successful in this, you must assume a greater liveliness, a little more freedom-yes, yes, you must not be coy and childish. Remember Edgar is no longer a boy; he is capable of loving. You must try to awaken this love in him; you must make him a slave to your wishes. Are you not handsome, my sister? Have you not a beautiful form, a beautiful face? There is a way of charming a young man-is it necessary to instruct you in this art? No, Carrie, I have a better opinion of you-only be a little more free, a little less reserved, and all will yet be well. Show him that you love him-yes, show him in a manner that can not be mistaken." 
                  Carrie did not raise her head-she would have been ashamed to look that brother in the face. She scarcely understood him, yet blushed at what she had heard. Though Carrie was wild and thoughtless, let us do her the justice to say that she was no less pure in thought than she was inconsiderate in conduct. She felt as if she had been guilty of a wrong in listening to her brother's instructions; and yet, despite the shock her modesty had received, she was far from banishing these instructions, without further consideration, from her mind. 
                  While thus silently leaning on her brother's arm, Edgar's voice was heard in the hall, inquiring for Lionel. 
                  "Edgar inquires for you," she said. "Do you not hear his voice?" 
                  "Yes," replied Lionel, and releasing Carrie's arm, he told her to make the best of her time, and left her to herself. 
                  He went to the stable. John was there, feeding the horses. 
                  "John," said Lionel, "saddle my horse." 
                  It was done. 
                  "Now take Mr. Armhold's horse to the pasture, so when he asks you to bring him you can tell him that he broke the halter during the night, and got loose, but that you would go in search of him." 
                  "What else, Master Lionel?" 
                  "Take our pair of grays also to the pasture, and if Armhold should want you to obtain a conveyance for him, tell him that you will try, but do your utmost to detain him here. Do you understand me, John? I don't want Armhold to leave before I return. Now, attend to what I've told you, and remember, all this is to be kept secret." 
                  So saying, Lionel mounted his charger, and galloped toward the city. In the mean time Edgar had made his way to the garden, where he espied Carrie, at a short distance from him, in an attitude of unstudied carelessness, reclining on the green sward. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXVI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Art thou not dearer to my eyes than light? 
                              Dost thou not circulate through all my veins, 
                              Mingle with life, and form my very soul. 
                           
                         
                        YOUNG'S "BUSIRIS." 
                      
                   
                  CARRIE was not unconscious of Edgar's approach. Before he espied her she had seen him enter the garden and take the very path that led to where she was reclining. Like the rest of her sex, she was not to be taken by surprise or unprepared. For petty intrigues there's no mind so fertile as that of the female-and was not Carrie of that sex? And more-was not her jealousy aroused, and did not Lionel's instructions, or rather "hints," still fill her mind? 
                  It would be wrong to say that she had fully caught the meaning of his words. Despite the various little indiscretions that we have had occasion to notice in her conduct-despite her freedom of speech and manners-despite her want of restraint upon her actions-she was still as pure of thought and as ignorant of wrong as when she was first introduced to the reader of this story; and yet, no sooner did she now espy Edgar, than she resorted to means, which, had we not seen her before, would leave upon our mind the impression that Lionel had not spoken to her in vain. 
                  She appeared not to be aware of any one's approach. When Edgar had made his way up the graveled path, and was separated from her only by a few paces, she was still reclining there-on the beautiful green sward-with that unstudied carelessness, that soft languor and graceful abandon, which is well calculated to charm the youthful imagination. The sun that had just risen from behind the hills was throwing his bright beams all 
                      
                        MRS. HARRINGTON AND MR. NETHERLAND. 
                     
                     
                      around her. She was supporting her head, now gracefully raised toward the scarlet east, upon her left arm, while her right hand, dimpled and rosy, played with the tall grass around her. From under her flowing gown of soft white Nainsook, which, owing to its classic disarrangments, by no means, detracted from her fascinating beauty, could be observed-had Edgar felt inclined to take the advantage-not only a pair of beautiful little feet encased in a pair of handsome black gaiters, but also a pair of small and prettily-shaped ankles, from which the gentle wind that played through the grass had spitefully blown the soft, pliant skirt, which but poorly concealed the beautiful outlines of her rounded form. 
                  Edgar stood there undecided whether to approach nearer or entirely to withdraw. But before he had time to come to a conclusion, Carrie, as if startled by something, had raised herself to a sitting posture, and, as she did so, her beautiful large blue eyes fell, like a sunbeam from heaven, upon Edgar's sad and thoughtful brow. Quick as thought, and as if ashamed to have been caught in her neglige, she lowered her head with a well-assumed bashfulness, and buried her glowing face between her rosy hands, saying in a voice, which rang, like the merry music of tiny silver bells, into Edgar's ears: 
                  "How you have frightened me, Mr. Armhold! What in the world can you want here?" But without giving him time to answer, she continued: O, I am ashamed of myself to be caught in this plight. But you shan't see my face-no, you shan't," and her laughing eyes threw mischievous ogles through between her dimpled fingers which she opened and closed with no less skill and coquetry than others of her sex do the fan. 
                  "Indeed, I'm sorry, Miss Carrie, to have disturbed you, but if my withdrawal to another part of the garden will partly atone for it, I shall not be slow to retire," replied Edgar, apologetically. 
                  "But you are here, and have seen me, and going away now would not mend the matter in the least," she said, laughing, at the same time removing her hands from her face, and mischievously looking into his eyes. "Do you want me to get up and greet you?" she continued, merrily-"Or what will you give me if I suffer you to help me to rise?" and she stretched both her hands out toward him.-"Won't you help me?" she appealed, playfully, as he approached and took hold of her arms. 
                  "Don't squeeze my hands so, Edgar," she said, laughing. 
                  "Why, Miss Carrie, I have scarcely taken hold of them. How do you expect me to assist you in rising without squeezing your hands a little?" he replied, innocently jesting. 
                  "I won't rise at all now," she said, mischievously looking up into his face. "No, I won't." 
                  "Well, just as you say;" and he would have dropped her hands, but when he was about to release them, he discovered that they still clasped his. 
                  "If you will promise to behave yourself," she said, smiling, "I will make room for you by my side." 
                  "I shall be very, very good," he said, with the artlessness so peculiar to his nature. 
                  "Very good?" she repeated, coquettishly looking at him. "Very good? Well, I shall see how good you can be." 
                  So saying, she released his hands, but not until she had once more fondly pressed them between her own. 
                  A moment later he was seated by her side. 
                  "Isn't this a beautiful morning?" she exclaimed, raising her large blue eyes heavenward. "O, how I do love the morning!" Then, interrupting herself, "O, how bad I do look! I'm so ashamed, Edgar! Don't I look very, very ugly?" and she turned her glowing face and soft, mellow eyes toward him, while the wind played in the long, red hair flowing down her shoulders. 
                  "You can not bait me strong enough to flatter you, Miss Carrie," answered Edgar, gazing on the glowing beauty by his side. How often do you wish me to repeat to you that you are handsome? Have you not a mirror, and do you not consult it? And is it not trustworthy?" 
                  "No!" 
                  "No?" said Edgar in return, smiling-"no? Is there a mirror into which you could have gazed without having seen the charms of all the graces blended and reflected?" 
                  "For shame, Edgar!" replied Carrie, while a happy smile danced in the curves of her lips-"for shame, to flatter me thus! I know, if I were half as charming as you would fain make me believe"-here she stopped, lowered her head, and continued in a more subdued tone-"I know you would love me." 
                  "And do I not love you?" he said, innocently. 
                  Now Carrie raised her head erect. Her face was as beautiful as a fresh-blown rose, and a strange fire shown in her mellow eyes. Her bosom heaved, and her whole form seemed to be pervaded by a peculiar feeling. She drew nearer to him; more powerfully heaved her bosom, and mellowe grew the flame in her eyes. 
                  "You don't love me," she said, at length, taking hold of his hand; "at least you don't show it." Then changing the subject, as if she feared she had pushed the matter too far-"Why don't you take off your hat, and let the wind play with your curls? No, I will not let you; you shall not remove the hat. I know what you are about: you want me to release your hand but I won't do it, Mr. Armhold. Your hand I have, and your hand I'll keep." 
                  So saying, she raised herself upon her knees, and moved right in front of Edgar. 
                  "Now, I'll remove your hat," she said, and endeavored to draw herself up, when, by design or accident, she fell forward right upon his bosom, with her cheeks against his own. 
                  "Ain't I awkward!" she exclaimed, amid a shout of laughter, but without making the least effort to remove herself. "Why don't you help me?" she continued, drawing nearer, at the same time making him feel the weight and pressure of her whole form, which now rested almost solely upon his lap. Her cheeks were still lying, and her heaving bosom still pressing, against his own. 
                  After the lapse of a few minutes, she regained once more her balance, and was again kneeling by his side. She then gently removed his hat, and no less gently stroked his raven curls. 
                  She gazed at him, and smiled. Her hand was again in Edgar's. He was about to withdraw it, when she seated herself so close to him that their forms touched, and her flowing white gown covered his limbs. She still held his hand, and drew it upon her lap. 
                  A blush stole over Edgar's cheeks; a moment later he was as pale as before. 
                  "Miss Carrie, permit me to retire," he said, steadily and calmly looking into the panting beauty's face. 
                  She returned that look-reproach and illyconcealed love blended. 
                  "You would not wish to retire were Hannah here." 
                  "No, Carrie." 
                  "I know that you love her." 
                  "I love you also, Carrie." 
                  "Why, then, is my presence hateful to you?" she said, sadly, tears gathering in her eyes. 
                  Edgar waited a moment, raised his body to its natural hight, then turned his thoughtful brow upon her, and said: 
                  "Carrie, from the friendship that binds you to me and me to you, I feel warranted in speaking to you with the freedom and unreserve which a brother would assume toward a loving sister who stands on the brink of an abyss. Carrie, I shall not feign to have misunderstood your conduct: it would be doing injustice to yourself-injustice to me. If I thought less of you, I should withdraw without uttering a syllable; but I know your kind disposition, and your warm, loving heart, and I should think it wrong to leave you without a kindly admonition. O, Carrie, Carrie! I too am young, and, like yourself, alive to the peculiar sensations of ripening youth, but unlike yourself, capable of restraining my passions. And yet, what a mighty difference between you and me!-I, a man-you, a woman. A stain that would scarcely be noticed on me, would be enough to make an outcast of you. Carrie, you have fed too much upon your imagination, without looking at the sad picture the world presents. Look! Here is the gay deceiver, laughing at his crime, having lost not the least in his reputation, and, if possible, a greater favorite with your sex for the power he has exercised over it. He has lost nothing, Carrie, nothing. He is still allowed to figure in the drawing-rooms, and is almost challenged to tempt again. Now, look there! Behold yon girl! How sad and dejected! Pale is her brow, emaciated her face, and downcast her gaze. And yet she is beautiful. Sorrow is written in every feature, and tears are in her eyes. She, Carrie, is the tempted-the fallen girl. Society has cast her forth, and frowns upon her now. No one cares to recognize her. She is forsaken and forlorn. Her best, her dearest friends have barred the doors against her. They make her feel each day, each hour, each moment, the bitter curse of her shame. Children, yet scarcely conscious of her trespass, point their tiny fingers at her wasted form, and whisper to themselves. 'There she goes! Look at her! What can be the matter with her? What can she have done, to look so sad and humbled?' And they follow in her track as she glides, like a pale shadow, to and from her wretched home. Yes, Carrie, she, too, was once happy-a beloved and honored daughter of society. She, too, had her friends, her admirers. She, too, was clad in her silks and satins, and was the belle of some fine drawing-room. Her thoughts were pure-her heart was warm as yours. She loved-indiscreetly loved. The object of her admiration, flattered by it, returned that passion. They went from step to step, not dreaming of the brink that yawned before them, until-she fell! A moment's bliss-a tender thrill-'t was all! He, Carrie, who wronged a lovely maiden thus-who stole from her both peace and happiness-who robbed her of her honor, made an outcast of her, deprived her of her virtue, took advantage of her weakness, and by so doing stamped the seal of shame, disgrace, and dishonor upon her brow-he, Carrie, he has lost nothing. But she-the poor, poor girl, sullied in character-has lost all; in that moment's bliss died all that is dear to woman. Cast forth, despised and dishonored-no one to pity her, no one to reach out a hand to restore her to grace-she falls from day to day, from month to month, from year to year, lower and lower, until at last-reckless grown by misery-she madly flings herself into the arms of dissipation, becoming an abject slave to the vilest passions. Look into that wretched brothel, and see whether you can still recognize, in the features of yon loud, noisy, cursing and inebriated wretch, who is reeling in the arms of her paramour, the once modest, virtuous, lovely, and honored daughter of society! Another year has passed. Look again in yonder brothel! The face we had recognized is no longer to be seen. Way up in an attic chamber-alone, quite alone, with no one to wait upon her, sick and dying-she lies upon a mat of straw. Her eyes and cheeks are sunken; her whole form is emaciated; her brow is feverish, and her feet are already growing cold. She is dying-away from her home, away from her friends, away from her acquaintances! A single word of pity, in time, might have averted her doom; but to the fallen woman it had been denied, and now see what has become of her! A wreck, that scarcely shows of what it is a wreck! The hour of her dissolution draws nigh. She feels herself. For the last time she indulges in a retrospective view. All her struggles, all her sorrows, pass before her mind. She thinks again of her childhood, and bitter, bitter tears roll down her sunken cheeks. She thinks of her degradation-of the abyss into which she had fallen at an unguarded moment, and she weeps still more. Poor, poor woman! dearly has she paid for her sins!--Carrie, the man who robbed her of her honor is yet the man of fashion: the man of flippant tongue. He is proud of his conquest over innocence, and cares little for the mischief he has done-for the wreck he has made-for the life he has embittered-for the future he has destroyed. Carrie, Carrie! Edgar Armhold is not so base as he!" Then, after a moment's pause, in a more subdued voice: "Will you now release my hand?" 
                  Carrie had more than attentively listened to these remarks. When he had concluded, she raised her head, which had been lowered over her bosom, and exhibited a face bathed in tears. She released his hand, and, as she did so, suffered her eyes to rest on his pale, handsome countenance. 
                  "O, Edgar, Edgar!" she commenced, in a voice that betrayed the deepest emotion, "I know that you now despise me; but I love you so much!" Here she interrupted herself, and, covering her face with her hands, began to sob aloud. 
                  "No, Carrie," he said, tenderly, "I do not despise you; you do me wrong even to think so. You have been more than kind to me, and I shall never, no, never cease to love you." 
                  He sought her hand, and pressed it to his lips. She turned her face upon him; it was paler than usual, and tears suffused her eyes. 
                  "Edgar," she commenced, "I can not disguise my feelings from you. Believe of me whatever you will, but do not think me capable of wearing a mask. The first moment I saw you-child as I was-my heart turned toward you, and I loved you. I could not conceal it then-I can not conceal it now. You are my all, Edgar-my very soul, my very life. If it is wrong in me to confess it, why, then, in the name of God, let it be wrong! I can not help it; I must speak as I think, or not speak at all. I know well that society imposes the duty of dissembling on my sex; but the more I have tried to be true to her behest, the more signally have I failed in my attempt. Why should I assume an indifference toward you, when I live and breathe only in you? Is it wrong to confess it? Let it be so. The world may call me immodest, but my heart will not. I love you, Edgar! I boldly assert it and strongly feel it. Give me, O, give me your love in return! I ask no more-can take no less!" 
                  She paused for an answer, and began to play with the grass around her. A moment later she had raised her face, for Edgar had broken the silence. 
                  "Carrie," he said, almost in a whisper, "I esteem and honor you for your simplicity-for your artlessness. I love you for your goodness-for your kindness. You have spoken to me with that unreserve which only innocence and a lofty mind can assume. Let me be no less free to you; let us understand one another. You love me, Carrie; you said so, and I believe it. Do I love you less? No: never loved a brother a sister more; never loved a man a woman more. You will therefore kindly listen to what I have to say. Come, Carrie, let me have your hand in mine-so." He drew a little nearer, then continued, shaking his stray hair over his serene brow: "In youth, who does not think of the future? Who does not make some plans? Who does not inquire of his mind what will be his fate, his destiny? The most careless, the most indifferent being will, at times, question himself what will become of him in the future. I, too, Carrie, have asked myself that question, and many others that would naturally arise when one is in such a train of thinking. 'Will I ever marry? Whom will I marry?' I have asked myself. 'Does Carrie love me? Do I love her in return? Are my affections for her not more those of a brother toward a sister, than those of an enamored lover toward his bride?' Carrie, I have pondered over these questions-I have answered them. Strong and unshaken as my love toward you is, ever shall be-aye, unto death and beyond it-it is still not the kind of love I should like to offer one who is to become the partner of my life. Nay, sister, do not tremble, for I do not wish to wound your feelings." 
                  "O, Edgar, Edgar! you have broken my heart! See, upon my knees"-and she threw herself in that attitude-"upon my knees I beg you to love me! The more I hear you speak, the more I grow attached to you. O, let Carrie be your slave, your servant-but do not drive her from you! She will be a true, a faithful wife to you; she will study your wishes; she will-will-will die for you!" and she began to sob aloud. 
                   
                  "No, Carrie," he said, sadly; "live for me. Edgar Armhold needs a sister. O, be you that sister!" 
                  So saying, he raised her hand to his lips, then rose to his feet, and slowly made his way back to the house. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXVII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              What a frail thing is man, it is not worth 
                              Our glory to be chaste, while we deny 
                              Mirth and converse with woman: He is good 
                              That dares the temper, yet corrects his blood. 
                           
                         
                        SHIRLEY'S "LADY OF PLEASURE." 
                      
                   
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              But who can view the ripened rose, nor seek 
                              To wear it? who can curiously behold 
                              The smoothness and the sheen of beauty's cheek, 
                              Nor feel the heart can never all grow old? 
                           
                         
                        BYRON'S "CHILDE HAROLD." 
                      
                   
                  WHILE Edgar was making his way back to the house, with Carrie's eyes following him until he was out of sight, in the mansion of Mr. Preston, at Avondale, early as the hour still was, Miss Hannah had already forsaken both her couch and room, and was seated on the balcony, absorbed in deep thought. She was unusually pale and pensive, and there was a peculiar exhaustion visible in her countenance, as if she had spent a restless night. At times, she sat there gazing absent-mindedly-with that blank gaze peculiar to abstraction-into vacancy, and would heave a long breath, generally followed by a deep sigh, as if something weighed heavily upon her mind. An hour passed in this manner before she seemed to recollect herself, when she rose from her seat, slowly passed her small hand across her serene brow, then, raising her head and form in a haughty pose, turned into the drawing-room, where she for a moment looked into the mirror, and, with an expression of determination on her lips and in her eyes, sought the library of her father. 
                  Mr. Preston was already up and reading. He generally retired early and rose with the sun. When Hannah entered the room he lifted his head from the book and looked at the pale, severe face of his daughter. 
                  "What are you doing up so early?" he inquired, good-humoredly. 
                  "Nothing, father," she replied, in a voice that sounded almost solemn. "Nothing. I was awake, and so I arose.' 
                  This was all she said. Mr. Preston once more looked into his book, and without paying any further attention to his daughter who was accustomed, like himself, to spend an hour or two in the library each morning, continued to read on from where he had been interrupted. In the mean time she also took up a volume and cast her eyes over it. Soon, however, it was dropped upon her knees. She had not gone to the library this morning for the purpose of reading. She had come to speak to her father about what weighed so heavily upon her mind. She would not disturb him, but would wait until the book was laid aside-wait for the moment when she might catch his eye. 
                  She had not to wait long. Mr. Preston was not the person who could read a dozen pages on one subject without getting tired of it. He raised his head, leaned back upon his easy chair and threw the book upon the desk behind him. 
                  "Trash, trash, trash," he muttered to himself, turning his eyes upon Hannah, who thinking this the proper moment, also laid her book aside, and commenced in a clear, low voice: 
                  "Father, you love your daughter Hannah-is it not so, father?" 
                  "You can not certainly doubt this." 
                  "You would see her happy," she continued. 
                  "Most assuredly-but to what is all this a prelude, daughter?" he asked, for he could read in her face and in the manner of her expression, that she intended to say something of greater importance. 
                  "Father, I am to marry Lionel-" 
                  "Within a month." 
                  "You have promised him my hand." 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Mother has promised him my hand." 
                  "Yes." 
                  "And so have I," she added, with more emphasis. 
                  "Well?" 
                  "I do not love Lionel-I cannot become his wife." 
                  Mr. Preston fell back upon his chair in amazement. He felt stunned as if the lightning had struck him. Hannah observed the impression this information had made upon his mind, and continued: 
                  "Father, if you do not wish to sacrifice your daughter's happiness-if it is not your desire to plunge her into misery, suffer her to break this engagement at once, for she would sooner die than marry Lionel Harrington." 
                  "What has happened between you to produce so great a change in your feelings toward your betrothed?" 
                  "Nothing, father. I do not love him, that's all," she replied, and began to pace up and down the floor. 
                  "Nothing at all," repeated her father, passing his fingers through his hair. "Nothing at all; and all at once you have discovered that you do not love him? Pshaw! this is only a foolish, capricious whim of a fickle-minded girl. I presume you have quarreled about some trifle, and, consequently, this splendid match is to be broken off, and the world is to see that we have made asses of ourselves. Go to, go to, and drive away this silly freak. You are engaged to be married to your cousin Lionel, both your 'ma and I have given our consent to this union-think you we can compromise our honor now to consider all we have done as mere child's play? Lionel is your bride-groom; in a month he is to be your husband. I hope, Hannah, you do understand the delicate position you occupy at the present." 
                  "I do, father," she replied, quite composedly, "therefore I have come equivocally to inform you that I shall never be the wife of Lionel Harrington. I once thought I could learn to love him-I now loathe him." 
                  As she said this, her thin, pale lips curled bitterly. 
                  "What would you have us do?" 
                  "To annul the engagement between Lionel and myself." 
                  "He will ask me for reasons, daughter." 
                  "Please tell him I do not love him; or, if you prefer it, father, I shall state to him the reason myself." 
                  "Daughter, this is an unpleasant piece of business. You will see that we shall have trouble on account of it. Lionel will have a right to be incensed, for why have you promised to become his wife if you did not love him? You were free to act as your own heart dictated in this matter." 
                  "Father, I pray you, do not bring me to task now for what I did then. I can't recall the deed-would that I could! no sacrifice should be too great." 
                  "Well, well, I shall consider this matter, and also speak to your 'ma about it. It is a very unpleasant piece of business-it is a very unpleasant piece of business." 
                  With these words he rose from his seat and left the library. 
                  Let us return once more to Clifton Avenue. 
                  At Harrington's breakfast was over. Edgar had sent for his horse, but the servant informed him that he had broken loose during the night, and could not be found in the stable. Edgar had begged him to obtain another, but hour after hour had passed, and still no servant made his appearance. In the mean time Carrie was waiting in the drawing-room for Edgar. It was nearly ten when he passed through the lower hall. 
                  "Mr. Armhold!" 
                  He turned. It was Carrie who had called him. She was seated on a divan of purple velvet. Edgar approached her, and took a seat by her side. He spoke to her upon various matters with that ease and nonchalance few could have assumed under such circumstances. Soon, however, he discovered that the wound his conversation in the morning had inflicted upon her feelings was still bleeding. She was very much, very much reserved, and the rose had vanished from her cheeks. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she said, as a proper occasion offered itself to turn the conversation in that channel, "will you suffer me to ask you a few questions concerning which I should like to gain some information? I hope you will not think me prompted by sheer curiosity." 
                  "Speak, Miss Carrie." 
                  She suffered for a moment her large blue eyes to rest upon his features before she commenced. 
                  "Mr. Armhold, have you ever loved me well enough to marry me?" 
                  "Miss Carrie, you have ever been dear to me. A brother's love can not exceed mine for you." 
                  This was not as satisfactory a reply as Carrie desired to hear. 
                  "I pray you, Mr. Armhold, speak with less equivocation. Have you ever thought upon a union between ourselves?" 
                  "As I stated to you this morning, I have." 
                  A silence of several minutes ensued. Carrie was the first to break it. 
                  "And now you think such a union impossible," she said, with a downcast look. 
                  "Miss Carrie, let me beg to change this unprofitable conversation. For the love and friendship I feel for you, let this theme be banished from our minds." 
                  She appeared not to take the least heed of what he had said. 
                  "A jealous eye looks far," she added bitterly. 
                  "O, Carrie-" 
                  "And is not slow in finding out a rival." 
                  "You have no rival, believe me, you have not." 
                  "You love cousin Hannah; I know you do." 
                  "Why should I not love her?" 
                  "Because she is the betrothed of my brother-his affianced bride." 
                  "And must I love her less dearly on that account?" he said, innocently. 
                  "Mr. Armhold, you have thrust yourself between Lionel and Hannah." 
                  Edgar changed color. He was not prepared for such a charge. 
                  "Miss Carrie," he said, evincing considerable uneasiness, "I am deeply grieved to hear you give expression to such a thought." 
                  Still she did not heed his answer, but continued: 
                  "You love Hannah, and she loves you in return." 
                  "If you persist, Miss Carrie," he said, rising, "I shall find it necessary to take my leave." 
                  "She has given you a souvenir-" 
                  "O, Miss Carrie-" 
                  "And you have accepted and pressed it to your lips." 
                  "It was a token of friendship-nothing more," he said in justification of her cousin. 
                  "It was a token of love-nothing less. Do you think me so dull as not to understand my modest"-with what irony this word was spoken-"cousin's tricks? O, Mr. Armhold," and she raised herself to her natural hight, "I understand my cousin Hannah. She has robbed me of your affection, and most shamefully abused my confidence. I, foolish, unsuspecting girl, had opened to her my heart, and she stole from it its richest jewel. And you, Edgar Armhold," and she pointed her index finger at him, while her eyes flashed fire, "yes, you have played with my feelings and my love, and now, after my attachment for you has grown too great-has become an unconquerable passion-now, you will feign the gentleman and undeceive my mind. O, wondrous generosity! after stabbing me to the heart to recommend such a salve to cure it." 
                  So saying, she rose to her feet and began to pace up and down the full length of the floor. She was laboring under no ordinary excitement. Her cheeks were still pale, her eyes were restlessly rolling in their sockets, and her lips had grown ashy and tremulous. 
                  Edgar had stationed himself close to the door, and silently watched her. When she came near him she threw a contemptuous look at him, and smiled bitterly. He lowered his head, and she passed on. A few moments later she was once more seated on the divan. A peculiar calm had spread itself over her brow, and judging from her looks, a feeling of reproach had taken possession of her soul. Edgar observed the change. He saw her excitement had, to a great degree, subsided. He would take advantage of the present moment and would speak to her. Noiselessly leaving his position near the door, he moved forward until but a few paces separated him from her, when he stopped. 
                  "Miss Harrington," he commenced, in a voice that was no less sad than sweet, "suffer me to tax your patience for awhile; I shall not speak long-no, Miss Harrington, a few words will suffice." 
                  She did not raise her head, and he continued: 
                  "Had you only spoken of myself, Miss Harrington, I should not now stand before you to assure you of my innocence. No, however great my grief to be so poorly understood by one for whom I should have laid down, and would still lay down, my very life, I would have withdrawn, waiting for the proper time to undeceive your mind. But you have spoken also of Miss Hannah, and accused her of a deed unworthy of her name-unworthy of her character. Miss Harrington, she has been a sister, aye, more, much more than a sister to me, and I love her. I would cheerfully sacrifice my whole life's happiness to insure a moment's bliss for her. She is your brother's intended-my friend's affianced wife. They love each other, and a short, short month will make them one. O, Miss Harrington, do not, for the love you bear them, disturb their dream of bliss. Do not awaken in Lionel's bosom a spirit of jealousy. He is quick and passionate, and may, in a moment of excitement, and under the influence of an erroneous idea, forget himself. I do not fear for myself. No, Miss Harrington, I have suffered much, I can suffer still more. But Hannah, who is as pure and innocent as the babe in its happy slumber, she would have to suffer, and tears would bedim those eyes of blue. Spare her that grief. Never more charge her with faithlessness. It is unworthy of you. It is not Carrie who can speak thus and be herself, For I know that you love your cousin Hannah, and would not do her wrong. As for myself-one word and I shall leave you. We have been warm-warm friends, thinking much of one another. I have learned to love you and look upon you as a sister. Let us not part in anger. See, I do not upbraid you for the language used toward me. I know it was uttered during the anguish of your soul, and all I can do is-to weep with you." 
                  So saying, he turned around, and, crossing the floor, retired from the drawing-room. At that moment, just in time to catch a sight of his receding figure, Carrie raised her face, bathed in tears, and exclaimed, in the full anguish of her soul: 
                  "Edgar! Edgar! do not-O, do not leave me thus." 
                  He had heard her voice. It penetrated his heart and he felt a kind of remorse-he knew not for what. 
                  He returned. 
                  "O, Edgar! Edgar!" she exclaimed, and fell prostrate at his feet. 
                  He looked down upon her-tears were in his eyes. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXVIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              But all in vain: no fort can be so strong. 
                              No fleshly breast can armed be so sound, 
                              But will at last be won with battery long, 
                              Or unawares at disadvantage found; 
                              Nothing is sure that grows on earthy ground; 
                              And who most trusts in arm of fleshly might, 
                              And boasts in Beauty's chain not to be bound, 
                              Doth soonest fall in disadventurous flight. 
                              And yields his caitiff neck to victors most despite. 
                           
                         
                        SPENSER'S "FAIRY QUEEN." 
                      
                   
                  LIONEL did not return home before evening. On his arrival he still found Edgar a guest at his father's, if the house can be properly called his father's, as Mrs. Harrington was indisputably swaying the scepter there. He was by no means surprised at Edgar's detention. He had given John the order not to supply him with any conveyance with which he might reach Cincinnati proper, and the order had been simply obeyed. But what did surprise him, was the coolness with which, he was pained to discover, Carrie treated Edgar. Lionel had, before his departure in the morning, plainly given her to understand by what means she could and was to make a captive of him; and now, contrary to his earnest wish and expectation, he observed that, instead of having grown more free and unrestrained in conduct, she had become even more reserved than he had ever known her before. He could well imagine that something must have occurred to have produced this effect. He knew well enough that Carrie, without some cause, would not have grown so distant. She had evidently tried the experiment recommended by him, and had failed. The result was natural: her advances having been repelled, she had grown reserved. When Lionel had alighted from his horse, he had joined his mother, Edgar, and Carrie, who were resting on the stiles leading up to the front door. There he had seated himself, and discovered what is above related. 
                  After Edgar had explained to him the cause of his detention, Lionel merely laughed, and promised to give him his horse after supper, provided he could not be persuaded to remain with them until morning. On account of something which had to be written yet that night, Edgar politely declined the kind invitation to remain, and accepted the offer of the use of the horse, provided his own could not be found by the time of his departure, which, by the solicitation of Mrs. Harrington, he reluctantly consented to postpone until after supper. 
                  Having spoken upon some unimportant subjects for several minutes, Lionel, after winking to Carrie, rose from his seat and entered the house. He went directly to his sister's room, where he threw himself upon a small, comfortable settee, muttering something to himself; then, passing his hand over his brow and through his hair, he once more rose to his feet, and, assuming an expression of considerable perplexity, began, in irregular strides, to pace up and down the narrow room. 
                  Fifteen minutes later, Carrie joined him. He could not see her face, nor observe its expression-she carried it so low. Her eyes were bent upon the floor. She took the first seat near the door, without raising her head. 
                  "What the deuce is the matter with you?" commenced Lionel, in his abrupt way of speaking, after eying her for a minute. "You look as if you had reached the last stage of despondency;" and he threw himself once more upon the settee. 
                  "So I have." 
                  He raised himself into a sitting posture, and, as if struck with the strangely solemn sound of Carrie's voice, looked at her with something like curiosity. She had, with the "So I have," raised her head, and now brother's and sister's eyes met. Lionel saw that she had grown sad, pensive, and even thoughtful, since he had seen her in the morning. Her eyes were no longer the same, he thought. They had always been restless, laughing, bright, and mischievously ogling, but now they looked sad and steady, and had a "subdued" expression. 
                  While thus observing her, Lionel himself had grown somewhat more calm and serious. 
                  "Then you have reached the last stage of despodency?" he said, lowering his voice several keys. 
                  Carrie did not reply. She only gazed at him; that was all. Never were her eyes so expressionless. They were opened, but, despite the fullness of their size, they could not be seen. There was something blue in their sockets that did not move, did not vary-that seemed to be rather the shadow of blue than the color itself, and was seen from under something that was very clear, and no less colorless than it was clear. 
                  "Then you have reached the last stage of despondency?" Lionel repeated for the second time, lighting a cigar and slowly placing it to his lips; after which he rose and thoughtfully paced up and down the room. "Why?" he continued, after a short pause, placing himself before her. 
                  
                     Why! why! How could she answer this question? Had she not some sense of honor left? Had she not some modesty? Could it be expected that she should feel no shame in acquainting her brother-though it was he who had counseled her to it-of her conduct? She was a woman; and what woman is so depraved as not, at times, to feel some shame? 
                  Lionel, perceiving that she remained taciturn, repeated, in a still lower key-"Why?" 
                  For a moment she sat there as if petrified, and shrank within herself, as she lowered her head and hid her face in her hands. She began to weep, the sobs almost stifling her. Her head rocked to and fro. She could no longer restrain herself. A mighty storm raged in her bosom. 
                  "Carrie, don't make a fool of yourself," said her brother, frowningly, watching, and partly feeling, the agony of her soul. "What has happened? Dry your tears, and let me know the result of your interview with Edgar." 
                  She raised her head, and wiped away her tears. A few minutes later Lionel knew all that had transpired. Being done, she began to weep again. The act of narration, no less than the subject itself, called forth a fresh shower of tears. It had gone almost against her nature to recapitulate the events of the morning. She was sensitive in the highest degree, and no less proud than sensitive, though her pride was bereft of that haughtiness and dignity with which her cousin Hannah was so richly endowed. 
                  "Carrie, I fear you have misunderstood me-" 
                  She did not suffer Lionel to finish the sentence. Riveting her eyes, which were now glistening with strange brightness, upon his face, she burst out: 
                  "Misunderstood you-misunderstood you! Now, since your plan has failed, you would shuffle the responsibility from your own shoulders and throw it upon mine? Is it this that you are after? O, God! O, God! and was my conduct so shameful that you will have nothing to do with it?" 
                   
                  "I tell you, Carrie, you have misunderstood me. I wished merely to inform you that you have gone beyond your instructions; yes, Carrie, beyond your instructions. You should have considered the matter a little more. All I wanted you to do was to fascinate, to charm Edgar, but not to propose to him. You are beautiful, Carrie, in the full sense of the word! You have a handsomely rounded figure, a fair complexion, a graceful gait, and many other charms not likely to escape eyes like those of Edgar's. You should have availed yourself of these charms, and compelled him to propose to you. You should have displayed more policy, and less eagerness-yes, less eagerness. Men are not made of iron, Carrie; they, too, have their weaknesses, and Edgar is a man. You should have studied his weakness, and acted upon it. You spoke too much of your love to him, which abated and dampened the fervor of his own. Men admire a pretty woman, and at Edgar's age it takes little to call forth that passion. Had you made simply your beauty the means by which to accomplish this end, rest assured you would not now have to mourn over your ill success. To win a man's love, a woman must appear not to seek it, while she suffers no opportunity, which may be improved to her advantage, heedlessly to pass by. She might call his attention a hundred times to her charms, yet leave the impression upon his mind that nothing is further from her intentions. Thus you should have acted; but, instead, you have done the very opposite. Therefore, I repeat, you have gone beyond your instructions. You entered upon your mission with too much zeal. I now recommend to you a greater proportion of moderation than you have heretofore displayed. The step you have taken was a wrong one. Be more cautious in the future, and all will yet be well." 
                  He had, before speaking this, seated himself by the side of Carrie. Now he rose, re-lighted his cigar, and placing it between his lips, again began to walk up and down the room, mechanically gazing at the smoke issuing from his mouth. 
                  A sigh escaped from Carrie's breast. He turned around and retraced his steps. 
                  "Carrie," he said, "dry your tears, and let us go down stairs. At supper I want you to be yourself again. You understand me: I want you not to forfeit your reputation as being the most light-hearted girl in Clifton. Now, wash your eyes, as they are red from weeping." 
                  "Lionel, I can't go to supper." 
                  "Now, Carrie, I don't want you to be foolish and contrary." 
                  "I am neither foolish nor contrary." 
                  "Then go to supper, and appear as if nothing had occurred." 
                  "It is impossible, Lionel; do not ask such a thing of me. I can't dissemble. I must speak and look the thing I am. Had I to laugh now, I could not do it, were my life at stake. Therefore, force me not to join you all at supper. I would only make matters worse, and the breach between Edgar and myself greater. And, more than that, both mother and father might notice the change, and ask questions which, to say the least, would, to answer them, embarrass me." 
                  "Carrie, I do not want you to dissemble. Go down stairs, and speak to and treat Edgar with the courtesy due him. He has not offended you, and, therefore, you have no right to feel yourself offended. Believe me, he thinks much of you. Show him that you respect his sincerity, and think no less of him now than heretofore. I have thought of a plan, which, if carried successfully into execution, will be of advantage to us. Edgar is to go to Cincinnati to-night-he shall not go alone; I will have him to take you to Hannah's. You will then have an opportunity of making good what you have spoiled this morning." 
                  "Lionel, he will suspect something." 
                  "He will not. I shall play my card well. If I lose, it will be no fault of yours. I am determined that Edgar shall become your husband, and Hannah Preston my wife. Now, wash your eyes. Meet me down stairs." 
                  So saying, Lionel left his sister and joined Edgar, who was still seated in front of the house-Mrs. Harrington by his side. The conversation turned upon local matters, and as they were of little interest, we shall omit relating them, and once more return to Carrie, who, since her brother had left her, instead of obeying his request, had thrown herself upon the floor, to weep and sob. Never before had she felt so miserable-so abandoned. She had calmly listened to her brother, but her nature revolted at what he had no less calmly uttered. She knew-she felt herself degraded in her own eyes. She had no definite idea of what he precisely wanted her to do, and yet she could not persuade herself that he had given her honest counsel. Therefore she felt miserable and wept. Fifteen minutes later she still lay there sobbing. Some one was walking along the corridor but she did not hear the steps. It was Edgar, who was seeking his own room, to reach which, he had to pass by that of Carrie, the door of which stood ajar. He looked in, and observed her prostrate form. He heard her jobs, and once imagined he could hear his name pronounced. A tear came to his eyes. He went in-his step was very light; it made not the least noise upon the soft carpet. He had kneeled down by her side before she was aware of his presence. She raised her head, and as she did so, their eyes-both filled with tears-met. 
                  "O, Edgar," she sobbed, and once more suffered her brow to touch the floor. 
                  "Carrie-" 
                  He gently twined his arm around her waist, and raised the prostrate form. 
                   
                  "O, Edgar, kill me." 
                  He looked at the beautiful woman by his side, and pity and admiration took possession of his soul. He pressed a kiss upon her lips, stroked her hair for a second, and rose and left the room. 
                  An hour later they were supping. Carrie had also come down, and was at the table. She was laboring hard to follow her brother's advice. Her cheeks were once more rosy, and the smile had again returned to her lips. She was very talkative, and yet a close observer could have detected that this liveliness was only assumed, and that her heart was an entire stranger to it. Edgar, however, was of the opinion that she was truly happy, had forgotten all the unpleasant conversation that had passed between them at their several interviews during the day, and therefore felt happy himself. He, too, grew very communicative, and not unfrequently his eloquence charmed the whole company. His mind was well stored with knowledge, and now he seemed to be carried away by the happiness of his own soul, and the great wealth of his mind made his tongue prodigal. Carrie listened to every word that fell from his lips, and treasured them in her memory. When she gazed upon his face and observed the smile upon his lips-the lovely expression of his dark eyes-she fancied he had recanted, and was endeavoring to atone for the cruelty he had displayed toward her at their several interviews. Therefore her heart leaped for joy. Her voice rang like music through the hall, and her white, laughing teeth were closed scarcely for a moment. Lionel observed the conduct of his sister, and a smile of triumph hovered in the curves of his mouth. 
                  "Carrie," he commenced aloud, at an opportune moment, "you will have to disappoint Hannah. You can not go to uncle's to-night. Mr. Armhold's horse has not yet turned up, and I have promised him mine. So make up your mind to stay at home, unless Mr. Armhold will take you there in our buggy." 
                  This was said in an off-hand way. Edgar did not suspect any thing in this remark, for he answered at once: 
                  "It will afford me pleasure to drive Miss Carrie over to her uncle's." 
                  "I'm glad to be released of this job, I assure you," added Lionel, rising from the table. 
                  A half-hour later, an open buggy stood before the house. Carrie, Lionel, and Edgar were in the drawing-room, looking through the window. 
                  "Why has John brought the open buggy, I should like to know?" remarked Carrie, who was looking at the clouded sky. "I shouldn't be the least surprised if it were to rain before we get to our journey's end." 
                  "The covered buggy is broken," rejoined Lionel, casting a meaning look at his sister. "It may be advisable, however, to take an umbrella along for an emergency." 
                  "All ready," cried John, from the street. 
                  "Let us go," said Carrie, and, followed by Edgar and her brother, she left the drawing-room. When she approached the front of the buggy, she thought of her brother's advice. 
                  
                     Moderation-Moderation!
                   
                  She reached out her arm to Lionel in order to let him help her into the buggy. It was a master-stroke. She feigned not to notice Edgar, who stood behind her. A pretty young woman, being or appearing awkward in entering a buggy, is by no means calculated to show off her figure to disadvantage. Let us do her justice in saying that, if Edgar did not see a beautiful ankle and limb, it must simply have been for the reason that he looked away in a different direction while she suffered Lionel to lift her into the buggy. 
                  "Come on, Armhold." 
                  He was seated by her side, and John gave him the reins. 
                  "Good night." 
                  The switch was applied to the horse-Clifton was left behind them. 
                  The buggy was a cozy little thing, but scarcely wide enough for two to ride abreast. It was therefore necessary, in order to sit conveniently and not to glide off, to move up close to one another, which at the present moment was not neglected. 
                  "Don't drive so fast, please, I'm afraid," she said, drawing up a little closer. 
                  Edgar slackened the reins, and the horse, being well trained, fell into a walk. They spoke of a hundred little things, skillfully avoiding anything that had the least reference to the subject that had caused so much pain to both of them during the day. 
                  They had not yet made half the distance when it began to rain. Edgar opened the umbrella and held it over Carrie's head, against which proceeding she, however, so earnestly remonstrated that he felt himself obliged to share it with her. She moved still closer toward him, for the rain was driven by the wind against her face, which even Edgar could see. He, therefore advised her to take hold of his arm, which invitation she at once accepted. Thus locked to him, with her breast beating against his own, and her cheeks resting on his shoulder, they drove along, the storm in the mean time increasing more and more. The heavenly artillery had begun to roar and the fiery messengers to rend the sky. Closer, and closer, and closer still moved the frightened Carrie to the side of Edgar. He could not only feel the pressure of her arm, but also the throbbing of her heart. She clung to his side as if she had been riveted to it. 
                  "I am so afraid of lightning," she whispered at times, when Edgar would address some tender words to her which, she, however, feigned not to hear. 
                   
                  The shower had passed by, and the storm had subsided. The few remaining clouds had separated, and the blue heaven showed its star-dimpled face. Edgar and Carrie were now slowly nearing Avondale. Neither of them spoke. Both seemed deeply engrossed in thought. Not unfrequently Carrie would raise her eyes to Edgar's face as if she wished to read what was passing under its calm and pensive exterior. 
                  "O, isn't it charming now?" she exclaimed, as a soft breeze fanned her cheeks. 
                  Edgar turned his eyes upon the panting beauty by his side. How beautiful she seemed to him at that moment! Her soft blue eyes, in which shone a voluptuous fire, were raised to his, chiding him for his unnatural coldness. Upon her cheeks sat the rose, and upon her thin, nicely curved lips blushed the tulip. A personified flower garden was she, with the balmy breath of every herb breathing from her sweet lips. 
                  Edgar was a man, and partook not only of the virtues but also of the weaknesses of his sex. However strong his will, he could not, though his heart smote him for it, forego a temptation that, in his attempt to shun, as if by magic, drew him still nearer to it. By his side sat a panting, youthful beauty of desire. He could feel the slightest palpitation of her heart, and the beating of her bosom resting against his arm. He saw and felt, and felt and saw, and-was overcome. He bowed his head and met those eyes which were so blue and soft. They reproached him for his coldness. They seemed bathed in tears and melting away in sweetness. He could not reason away the feeling that pervaded his whole system as he looked upon her. He lowered his head still more, gently wound his arm around her waist, and pressing her bosom to his own, sealed a kiss upon her fiery lips. 
                  Reader! let us excuse that seeming weakness in the otherwise perfect character of our hero. Sardanapolis and Marc Anthony lost empires for a woman's smiles and favors. Why, then, should a youth of twenty be reproved? or the author censured for portraying such a character?

                  LET us return to Lionel. 
                  Before Edgar could have reached the outskirts of Clifton, Lionel had already made his way to the servants' hall and ordered John to bring him the missing horse, saddled and bridled. It required but a few minutes to execute this order. 
                  Lionel leaped into the saddle, applied the spur to his horse's flanks, then dappled down the road. He took the direction to Avondale but by a nearer route than Edgar had been taking, and conseqently reached his destination in a much shorter time. He stopped before his uncle's. A servant took his steed back to the stable, while he, himself, entered the house and at once proceeded into the parlor, which was lighted up, and at that moment occupied by a single individual-Hannah. She was sitting on a divan. A book was in her hand, and even when Lionel had partly crossed the floor, her eyes were still scanning its contents. Not until after he had taken a seat by her side and uttered her name, did she raise her head and lay her book aside. 
                  "I did not think that you would come to-night, Lionel, the heaven looks so menacing. We shall have a shower shortly," she said, in an unusually calm voice. It was evident that, though she may not have expected him that evening, his arrival by no means embarrassed her. 
                  "I came after a pair of runaways," he replied, laughing, at the same time scanning every nook in the drawing-room, as if he expected to discover a clue of them. 
                  "A pair of runaways? who are they?" inquired Hannah. 
                  "Why! ain't they here? I would have sworn they were here," continued Lionel. 
                  "No strangers have come here during the evening." 
                  "God bless you, Hannah, they are no strangers, unless you call Edgar and Carrie by that name. Would you believe it, he has been all day at my house; you know that he insisted on accompanying me home last night, and this morning, when I asked him whether or not he would go to the city with me, he simply laughed and said he had not Carrie's permission to do so, and therefore he staid. This evening he insisted upon treating her to a ride, and as his horse broke loose during the night, and was only found again a few minutes before I left home, I had to give him mine, though I told him that the poor animal was more than tired, and was entitled to have a full night's rest. Hannah, are they not here? Haven't they been here? They said they would call before they returned home." 
                  While Lionel was rattling this off in a nonchalant manner, Hannah had again picked up her book, and was feigning to read. When he had gotten through, she raised her head and merely said, "They are not here," then once more cast her eyes over the volume in her hand. 
                  Lionel could easily observe that Hannah was nettled at this information. 'Tis true, she had displayed considerable indifference during this recital; but did not her whole expression convince him that this indifference was merely assumed? "Why should this information vex her, if jealousy is quite out of the question?" he asked himself, and a bitter smile curled his lips. "She must be in love with Edgar-the signs are too plain," he thought. 
                  "Hannah," he continued, unfortunately laboring under an excitement which did not escape his cousin's notice-"Hannah, you evince but little interest in the welfare of your cousin Carrie. You certainly could not have been blind to the attachment growing and daily increasing between Edgar and my sister. Why have you forbidden your lips to touch this matter? Is it, perhaps, that you love Edgar yourself, and therefore envied your cousin the happiness of being loved by so worthy a man?" 
                  How much easier it is to give counsel than to obey it. Lionel, who had advised his sister to use moderation, could not control his own feelings, and was a slave to his own passions. 
                  "Lionel Harrington," she said, scornfully, rising from her seat and looking at him askant, "I was in hopes that I had been plain enough the last time we met, in expressing to you my disgust at your conduct: I feel assured that neither by virtue of our cousinship, acquaintance, or previous engagement, have you a right to claim the power of insulting me at will. You will bear this in mind in the future, or else I shall be compelled to adopt measures that will save me from your further insults." 
                  So saying, she haughtily crossed the room, and, placing herself before a window, looked out into the street. Lionel, though he understood her temper, was not quite prepared for such an outburst. It took him by surprise. Every word she had spoken fell with a crushing weight upon his mind. They had a stunning effect upon him. A sensation of faintness took possession of his heart. The truth was staring at him; he could not help seeing it-Hannah's mind was made up; she would not marry him. He could hear, see and feel that she was far from loving him-had no intention of uniting her lot with his. He felt perplexed-stupefied. For some moments he stared at her, as she still stood before the window with her back toward him-with the blank, unmeaning look we have when our thoughts, so to say, are paralyzed. 
                  "Hannah, you are not in good humor this evening," he ventured to say, after a short pause. 
                  She turned around. One glance of her cold steady eyes convinced Lionel that she was calm, and labored not under the least excitement. Her face was pale, so were her lips, and her features were as still and motionless as if carved in marble. 
                  She left the window, and seated herself on a chair. After wetting her lips with the end of her tongue, she raised her eyes toward her cousin, and said in a musicless, almost monotonous voice: 
                  "Lionel, I am not in bad humor, though I must confess your remarks would not have been calculated to dispel it, had I been in such a mood. I am simply sad-sad, Lionel, for I have committed a grave error, and am already suffering from its consequences." 
                  A soothing calm came over Lionel's spirit. He bent his head forward, and intently looked at her serene brow. "What could this grave error be?" he asked himself mentally. "Is it perhaps on account of her conduct toward me that she feels sad? Is it, perhaps, because she said she would not become my wife? It must be so-it must be so-" so, at least, reasoned Lionel, but he reasoned wrong. Imagining he had found the key to her sadness, a feeling of satisfaction took possession of his soul and subdued his voice. 
                  "Hannah," he said, "you have made me feel uneasy in saying you were suffering from the consequences of a great error you had committed. Though I can scarcely believe but that your goodness and innocence exaggerate the error, if error it be at all, yet since you are suffering from it, let me know, I pray you, Hannah-do you hear me?-I pray you let me know what it is; for what would I not do, what would I not sacrifice, to make you happy?" 
                  Hannah eyed him for a moment, and almost reproached herself for the bitterness of her feeling toward one who thought so much of her. 
                  "Lionel, we are cousins," she said, "do not think that I have never reproached myself for the bad temper which I, at times, and sometimes without sufficient reason, have exhibited in your presence. Let us first make friends, and then I shall explain to you-frankly, cousin Lionel-the cause of my sadness." 
                  "We are friends already," he said, smiling, rising from the divan, and seating himself by her side. "Yes, we are friends already," he repeated, "and though we have had petty quarrels, tell me, do not lovers always quarrel a little?" 
                  "I do not know, Lionel," she said, again suffering the tip of her tongue to wet her bloodless-seeming lips, "I don't know, Lionel, but one thing I do know-" she paused for a moment, and then continued-"we have quarreled, and it was simply for the want of love." 
                  A chill crept through Lionel's frame. He did not like this prelude-the turn the conversation was taking. What could she want of him? Why so grave a mien? 
                  He dreaded the sequel. 
                  "Hannah, I have always loved you-I do still love you," he said, in a low voice, scarcely audible; "and though I am quick and hasty, and at such times may give utterance to expressions that, in cooler moments, I would sooner have died than have uttered, yet there is no man so ready or willing as I to acknowledge and atone for any error which a want of due reflection might have led me to commit. I am conscious of having given you cause to be offended at me. I blush for my last night's conduct. What I did was done in a fit of jealousy, which sprung from an excess of love for you. Will you pardon and forget the past, and accept my promise never more to offend?" 
                  Hannah had a noble soul and a forgiving disposition. Lionel knew this, and therefore adopted-knowing that a confession of a wrong always pleases a high mind, because it is only a high mind that can freely confess a wrong-this method of regaining the favor of his offended bride. To some extent he was successful. Hannah felt more kindly toward him than she had done for some time before. His well-selected words had made a favorable impression upon her mind, and, for a moment, she faltered in the path which she had intended fearlessly and resolutely to pursue. She faltered, however, only for a moment. 
                  "Lionel," she said, "do you think it in our disposition to love whom we please?" 
                  "To some extent, yes. We need but make up our minds to love this one or that one, and-so I believe, at least-we can love such a person." 
                  "Do you think we can make up our minds to like or dislike any one-or, so to say, are not our minds already made up when we begin to love?" 
                  "I don't know, Hannah. I am of the opinion, however, that we are free to think and act." 
                  Hannah looked at him for a moment, and said: 
                  "I disagree with you." Then, as if she had strayed into a wrong channel: "Lionel, let me love you as I have always loved you. Let me be your cousin; nothing more, nothing less, nothing else. I have tried my utmost to love you as I should one who is so shortly to become my husband; but-but, I know not how it is-I can not, can not do it, Lionel. I know you would not make me unhappy by insisting upon this marriage. You see I speak freely to you. I am determined to let you read my heart; I have nothing to conceal. Why should I deceive you? Can I help feeling as I do? No. I have tried to persuade myself that I should learn to feel differently; but, whenever I reflect over the matter, I see the folly of thinking so. Lionel, be not angry, for I do not wish to make you angry. I can not become your wife! Be generous, Lionel, and be satisfied with a cousin's love." 
                  "Are you serious?" 
                  Hannah did not answer; it was not necessary. Her steady look, pale, determined face, and calmly-set features testified to her seriousness. 
                  After the lapse of a few minutes, Lionel continued: 
                  "Hannah Preston, I have calmly listened to you, have I not?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Well! Now please listen to me," and he drew his chair a little closer to Hannah's. "We are engaged to be married. Your father knows it; your mother knows it; our relatives and acquaintances know it; all Cincinnati knows it. It is no longer a secret; I have already extended invitations to our nuptials. What do you take me to be?-a boy-a fool? Do you really think I will suffer you to make me a laughing-stock for the whole city? Do you imagine, for a moment, that Lionel Harrington can be thus discarded? You say you can not be happy with me. Now, let me say to you that I can not be happy without you. You are betrothed to me; make up your mind to love me, for I am determined that you shall become my wife. Now, you have heard what I had to say. If you are wise, you will at once yield, and make a virtue of necessity." 
                  So saying, he rose from his chair, and began to pace up and down the floor. Hannah watched him with a bitter smile on her thin lips, and a slight frown on her brow. 
                  "Lionel Harrington," she said, "would you sacrifice me to your pride?" 
                  "You have heard my reply," he said, turning toward the window and looking out upon the street. 
                  "Then hear mine. Until now I thought you did love me, and hence felt sorry, in no slight degree, that I must wound your feelings by the information I felt it my imperative duty to impart to you," said Hannah. "But your words and actions are not those of a man who truly loves. They are rude, feelingless, and inelegant; and, therefore, I feel not the slightest compunction in breaking off this match. From this moment forth we are strangers-entire strangers." 
                  "Hannah, take back what you have said." 
                  "Never!" 
                  "I will give you five minutes' time." 
                  "I don't want one minute." 
                  "Hannah Preston, reflect!" 
                  "I would sooner die than marry you! Is not this answer decisive enough?" 
                  "It is." 
                  Lionel picked up his hat and crossed the floor, holding his head somewhat higher than usual. At the door he halted and turned around. 
                  "Miss Preston," he said, "in leaving you, I would simply remark that you have taught me a lesson that shall ever keep your name fresh in my memory. I now bid you goodnight!" 
                  He bowed himself out of the room. Some five minutes later Hannah turned her face toward the door, which still stood open. She could scarcely realize the position she was placed in. She had informed Lionel, in unequivocal language, that she considered herself free from her engagement, and now she felt as if a heavy weight had been rolled off her heart. Free once more! With that thought her spirit rose. She began to pace up and down the whole length of the floor, with head erect and eyes glistening like a gem. She smiled, but it was a bitter smile-a smile that spoke of the triumph of a bad angel over a good angel. 
                  "Sister Hannah!" 
                  She halted, and turned her face toward the door. Upon the threshold stood Ruth, with a book in her hand. 
                  She entered the drawing-room. 
                  "Will you hear me say my lesson, sister Hannah?" 
                  "No!" sharply replied Hannah, once more crossing over to the window. "Ruth!" she called, a moment later; but the little girl, having beaten a retreat back to her room, did not reply. 
                  Just then a light buggy drove up before Mr. Preston's house. It contained a gentleman and a lady. The gentleman at once jumped upon the pavement, hitched the horse to a tree, and then assisted his fair companion to alight also. 
                  Arm in arm they now entered through the front gate, and slowly made their way up the graveled path. 
                  They rung the bell; the door was opened by a servant, who, recognizing in the visitors Mr. Armhold and Miss Harrington, suffered them, unannounced, to enter the hall. 
                  Hannah was seated in a chair. A book was in her hand. She had also recognized the visitors as they walked toward the house. A sensation of faintness took possession of her heart. She knew not what was the cause of her feeling so wretched. She hastened to the mirror to see whether her face betrayed the condition of her mind. No; she was pale-nothing more. This satisfied her, and, with a bitter smile, she returned to her seat. 
                  Just then she heard steps in the hall; a moment later exposed the visitors to her eyes. She rose to meet them, and invited them to enter. Edgar begged to be excused; he had not a moment to spare, he said; he had to leave for Cincinnati. 
                  He released his companion's arm, and, wishing both pleasant dreams, took his departure. 
                  "O, Hannah, Hannah!" exclaimed Carrie, the tears gushing down her cheeks, after Edgar had left; "what have I done! what have I done!" and, sobbing, hid her face upon her cousin's bosom.

                              It is jealousy's peculiar nature 
                              To swell small things to great; nay, out of nought 
                              To conjure much; and then to lose its reason 
                              Amid the hideous phantoms it has formed.

                  "WHAT have I done! what have I done!" 
                  Carrie had good reasons for this exclamation. 
                  While we ascend the ladder of crime, and our thoughts are busy with our wicked intents, we neither heed, care, nor know the hight we are attaining in our reckless progress. It is only after we have done the deed of wrong-after we have journeyed the path of evil for some time-after we have paused from exhaustion, and coolly and deliberately looked down toward the path from whence we have started, that we understand the distance we have made, and conceive the magnitude of our crimes. 
                  It was even so with Miss Carrie Harrington. During the brief period she had used (as counseled by her brother) all the wiles of her sex to fascinate and charm Edgar Armhold, and had been partly successful in awakening in his bosom unholy desires, kindling in her own a corresponding feeling, only with greater intensity, which had made her forget the "moderation" which she had been admonished and had promised herself to pursue-during this brief period of seeming success, she had not dreamed of the mighty strides she had been taking in the path of error. It was only then-after she had gone too far, encouraged by his partial yielding and momentary exhibition of weakness-after she had thrown away all restraint over her actions-after she had cast herself wantonly into the arms of vice, and, with the eloquence of a woman whose very existence had been absorbed in the seething furnace of the brightly-burning, all-consuming flames of unrequited love and stimulating passion, had begged, with tears in her softened eyes, for his pity and for his love-it was only after she had found Edgar deaf to all her appeals-after he had (almost forcibly) removed her from her unbecomingly close-clinging to his person, and had unmistakably made her understand, both by looks and words, that she had little to hope and less to expect of him-it was only then that, like a stag at bay, she paused; and looking down the giddy hight she had attained in her onward march, and closing her eyes, exclaimed, "What have I done!" 
                  We have seen, in the preceding chapter, that Carrie had scarcely entered her cousin's house before she-overpowered and conscious of the magnitude of her wrong-had burst forth in that exclamation of woe; and as hearts which are surcharged with deep, deep sorrows, suffer the stream of misery to deposit its life-consuming poison either in the mind, to impregnate it with feelings of misanthropy, melancholy, and bitterness-or to hurry it to the tongue, making it free, voluble, and ungovernable-so Carrie, wretched beyond description, after she had been a short time alone with her cousin Hannah, had thrown off all restraint upon her speech, and related every thing that had transpired, not only during her ride with Edgar, but at her own home during the day. 
                  "I shall no longer be able to look into his face," she said, amid sobs and tears, after she had got through with the recital. "I shall not know how to hide my face from the world. O, why, why have I listened to my brother's voice?" she exclaimed, bitterly. 
                  Hannah said nothing in return. A bitter smile curled her thin lips. Though she felt and sympathized with her cousin's grief, yet it can not be denied that the information she had just gained gave her peculiar satisfaction. Was this simply because, in the conduct of Lionel, she had found another justification for her own actions? No; Carrie had failed in charming and fascinating Edgar: this was the chief cause, though she scarcely knew it herself. What was Edgar to her? Nothing, certainly; and, in all probability, their relationship would never be more that it was at present; and yet she felt some relief in what she had heard. 
                  "You should not have taken your brother's advice," she said, taking hold of Carrie's hand. "I thought you too sensible and modest to act in such a manner. Believe me, I should have died sooner than to have done likewise. Lionel-pardon the expression, Carrie-is a villain, devoid of all principle, else he would not have counseled his sister to forfeit her self-respect. I feel a double satisfaction in having broken with him." 
                  Before the cousins retired to bed, Carrie had been made acquainted with Lionel's visit to his betrothed, and the result thereof. On the following morning Mr. and Mrs. Preston were also informed of the steps their daughter had taken; and in less than a week the rumor had penetrated every house of their acquaintance. 
                  Thus a coldness sprung up between the families of Harrington and Preston. They scarcely ever visited, and when they did so, it was in a formal manner. In this way spring and summer had passed away, and autumn had made its appearance. Edgar was still a visitor at Preston's. He came there very frequently, imparting lessons to his foster-sister, and passing an hour or so in the company of Hannah, who was not altogether displeased with the little attentions he bestowed on her. During the day he invariably attended to his literary labors. He had by this time acquired a high reputation as a man of letters. His name had become familiar to every scholar in the country, and few were the publishers who did not solicit his contributions. And yet, despite the wealth he had accumulated; despite the honors that were heaped upon him; despite the flatteries of the fair sex; despite the fawning of men who then, as now, loved to follow in the wake of the literati; despite all this, and more, Edgar Armhold had remained the quiet, humble, unpretending, and unostentatious youth we have known during his poverty and his parents' lifetime. He visited only a select few: they were men of worth and merit. He listened to their conversation with that attention which only a man of refinement knows how to bestow. He was ever willing to learn, to gain information. He did not possess the vanity of showing off, on all occasions, the treasures of his own mind. He was above that. Among scholars with whom he associated he expressed himself in a scholarly manner. When with persons of less intelligence, he adapted his conversation to their capacity. Among the poor and lowly, how soft, gentle and sympathizing were his words! No pride-no haughtiness-no display. It was simply Edgar Armhold-Edgar Armhold with an open hand, an open heart. No one feared to approach him: there was something winning about his ways that drew the poor and unfortunate toward him. And when he rendered them assistance, how modestly it was done! One would have thought that they obliged him by accepting his favors. Thus the poor and unfortunate became his debtors, scarcely appreciating the magnitude of his goodness-the sacrifices he made for them. 
                  On a clear, cold afternoon, in September, after he had finished a poem that was to appear in the new Monthly, for which he had been engaged to write, he had his horse brought to him for the purpose of taking a ride to Avondale. It was four o'clock when he arrived before Mr. Preston's mansion. Having given his horse over to a servant, who was standing at the side-gate, Edgar walked toward the house, and, having found the door ajar, took the liberty of entering without ringing the bell. His step was noiseless. He passed along the marble floor of the hall until he arrived in front of the drawing-room-the door of which also stood ajar-when he stopped. Edgar looked in. A small fire was burning on the hearth, in front of which sat Hannah, her back turned toward him. She was reading in a small volume-it was an edition of Edgar's select poems. It had but lately appeared, and, though Hannah had read its contents over and over again, still she would refer to it when alone, as if each new reading gave her additional delight. This afternoon she had felt sad and depressed in spirit without knowing why. Her father and brother were in the city, her mother and Ruth had gone out to make a visit to a neighbor, and the servants were in another part of the house. She had felt lonesome and, as she had paced the room by herself, had heaved many sighs. She had soon grown exhausted, and having seated herself before the fire, had slipped that small volume from her pocket, and had begun to read in it. 
                  "Miss Hannah." 
                  She turned her face around. Edgar-pale, thoughtful Edgar-stood by her side. 
                  "Am I intruding?" he continued, as she rose, attempting to conceal under her apron the volume she had been reading. "If so, I shall retire." 
                  A blush stole over her cheeks and a smile curled her beautiful lips. "No, Mr. Armhold," she said, "you are not intruding. Please be seated;" and she placed another chair before the hearth. "It is somewhat chilly to-day," she continued; "don't you find it so, Mr. Armhold?" 
                  Edgar coincided with Hannah. He, too, thought it was somewhat chilly, and that it was by no means very unpleasant to find the room heated in such weather. He inquired after the balance of the family-after little Ruth-and being informed that all were absent, he smilingly said that he would suffer Hannah to entertain him until some one else of the family should arrive. The conversation became more free, and soon topic after topic was touched upon and dismissed. 
                  "What were you reading as I entered?" said Edgar among other things. "May I know it?" 
                  She smiled archly, nodding in the negative, at the same time lifting her beautiful blue eyes toward his handsome face. 
                  "May I know it?" he repeated softly. 
                  "No," she said, with her head lowered over her bosom, and a blush crimsoning her cheeks. Just then, accidentally, no doubt, the book fell upon the floor. 
                  "Shall I?" he said, laughing, reaching his hand toward the book. 
                  She answered nothing in return. 
                  "No, I won't take the advantage, Miss Hannah," he said after a short pause, gazing at her face which was still bent over her bosom. 
                  She removed her chair, bowed down, picked up the volume she had dropped, and laid it on Edgar's knee. He took it in his hand. It was the volume of poetry he had presented to her. 
                  "Have you nothing better to read, Miss Hannah?" he said, smiling. 
                  "I seek nothing better. I love to read in that book." 
                  While saying this, her eyes were watching her tiny fingers playing with the corners of her white linen apron. Edgar drew nearer-she did not raise her head-she did not cease playing with her apron. He gently took hold of her hand-it trembled in his own, but she did not withdraw it. She turned her face from him, so he could not see the blushes that had mounted to her cheeks. 
                  "Hannah," he softly whispered, drawing nearer to her. 
                  She did not answer, he could see, however, that she was agitated. Her bosom rose and fell with the emotion he had awakened. 
                  "She turned her head, and their eyes met. They were tell-tale eyes-they revealed their hearts' secrets. 
                  He gained courage. 
                  "Do you love me?" he continued, in a softer strain. 
                  Again no answer-she suffered her hand still to rest in his. She only lowered her head still more. 
                  Then he poured fourth into her willing ears the secret he had so long carried in his heart-that he loved her. O, with what eloquence he portrayed to her his feelings! Though his voice was scarcely audible, yet not a breath escaped her ears. It was music to her soul. O, with what delicacy he broached the subject! Ten-twenty-thirty minutes had passed, and still he spoke to her of love, and still she listened entranced to all he had to say. 
                  "Will you love me in return?" he now added, lifting her hand to his lips. 
                  She raised her head and looked at his beauful face, winsomely turned toward her. 
                  "O, Edgar," she lisped, and threw herself upon his bosom. "I am not worthy of you;" and she commenced to weep. 
                  It was already dark when Mrs. Preston and Ruth returned from their visit. Edgar and Hannah were still in the parlor, where they soon were joined by the two former. After the usual greeting had passed, Mrs. Preston begged to be excused and retired. Ruth was about to follow, when the sweet voice of Edgar called her to his side. 
                  "How is my little sister Ruth?" he said, affectionately looking into her swarthy face, and gently stroking her raven hair that loosely fell over her shoulders. "Has she been well and good?" 
                  She raised her large, dreamy black eyes, but said nothing. Edgar again shook her hand, promised to hear her lessons after supper, and then suffered her to depart, which she, however, did not do, until she had once more gazed upon the pale countenance of her foster-brother. 
                  Just then the house-door turned upon its hinges, and a moment later the voice of Mr. Preston was heard in the hall. Hannah turned crimson and Edgar became paler, if possible, than he was. 
                  Mr. Preston did not enter the drawing-room. He passed along the hall and was heard to enter the library. 
                  "Your father has rested by this time," said Edgar in a low voice, a few moments later. 
                  He rose, pressed a kiss on Hannah's forehead, and noiselessly glided from the room. Hannah also rose from her seat, and in hasty but irregular strides measured the floor; stopping sometimes at a window, casting a vague glance toward the street, and then whispering something to herself, she would abruptly turn around, resume her walk for another moment or so, then with an equal abruptness stop before the hearth, look into, and absent-mindedly, watch the flickering flames and the gray smoke curling up from the glowing embers. 
                  In this manner she passed nearly a half hour. All at once she heard foot-falls in the hall. She changed color and her heart began to throb. She knew them-they were Edgar's steps. They came nearer and nearer She did not raise her head, though she knew some one was approaching her-was standing by her side-was twining his arm around her waist-was leading her through the drawing-room, whispering into her ears: "You are mine, Hannah, mine-forever mine." 
                  She followed him, without raising her eyes from the ground. She felt as if she could weep-and still not a tear came to her eyes. 
                  He conducted her into the library. Both Mr. and Mrs. Preston were there. A moment later the lovers kneeled before them, asking for their blessing. 
                  Edgar staid late that night. Joy and happiness were written on every face except on Ruth's. A veil of deep sorrow seemed to have been flung over her swarthy features. Her face had, as it were, put on mourning. It reminded one of an over-clouded sky in October. Her eyes were dry, dull, immovable. She had only joined the company in the drawing-room after they had sent for her several times, and even then she only spoke little, and that little with a sulkiness that could not but draw toward her the attention of the several members of the family. Sometimes her eyes would light up and glisten like those of the basilisk. At other times she would frown, and an expression of malice and bitterness would disfigure her countenance. And then again she would lower her head and listen to the tender words addressed to Hannah. 
                  This conduct did not escape the keen eyes of Edgar. Seated by his bride on a divan, her hand clasped in his, he called on Ruth to come to his side. 
                  "Why so still and sad this evening, my little sister?" he inquired affectionately, after she had come near him. 
                  Until that moment she had not raised her head; stubbornly she had held it downward as if she had been ordered to do so. But now, as the gentle voice of Edgar once more fell upon her ears-the voice that had so often called her "sister"-she felt as if she could forgive him, though she knew not of what, or how he had offended her. She lifted her large, dreamy eyes to his happy face and scanned its every feature. She did not seem to be satisfied with her inspection; at least the impression it left upon her mind had the effect of giving her ingenuous features an expression of undisguised hatred and bitterness. 
                  "You should be lively-happy, this evening," said Edgar, watching her face. "This has been the most eventful day of my life. Come and be merry. See how happy your sister Hannah is-she is doubly your sister now. She loves your brother Edgar-loves him much and ardently-do you not, my dear?" he continued, as Hannah drew nearer to him and laid her cheek, with her soft blue eyes turned toward his face, upon his shoulder. 
                  Ruth saw it-something moved within her breast-it must have been gall. Her face turned green, her lips began to tremble, and in her eyes shone the fire of the furies. 
                  "I hate you," she more hissed than screamed, and with one bound leaped toward Hannah, and madly scratched her face; then, as if pursued by a thousand evil spirits, shrieking and yelling, she rushed from the room. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXXI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              O! nothing now can please me; 
                              Darkness and solitude, and sighs, and tears, 
                              And all the inseparable train of grief, 
                              Attend my steps forever. 
                           
                         
                        DRYDEN'S "AMPHITRYON." 
                      
                   
                  RUTH had never dreamed that Edgar could or would love any person better than herself. He had often called her "my dear little sister," or "my sweet little Ruth," and these names generally pronounced in a soft, subdued, half pleading voice, had not fallen entirely on deaf ears, but had sunk deeply into her young heart, and, child as she was, had created a feeling, which, though still vague and undefined, was of a nature not easily to be destroyed. In short-she loved Edgar, though she knew not it was love. Where and when was she happier than when allowed to seat herself by his side, and to listen to his sweetly modulated voice, when he would gently stroke her hair, look affectionately into her eyes, and placing her head upon his lap, call her "my own, dear little Ruth?" To whom did she look up with more reverence, more faith, more love, than to him? Who was happier than she when evening came? Would it not bring her Edgar? Would she not hear his voice and see his face? And would he not take her by the hand, kiss her, and ask how she had been? 
                  She loved him as a child of her years can love. He had been a regular visitor at Preston's from the day she had made it her home. But when inevitable circumstances had prevented him from calling, and an evening passed without Edgar's presence, Ruth felt melancholy and forlorn, and could scarcely await the hour that would again bring to her eyes her foster-brother's face. 
                  Though deprived of a father's love, of a mother's care, of brothers' and sisters' affections, she still had been happy: for did not Edgar's tenderness make up for this mighty loss? Her whole life was absorbed in his. She loved but those who loved him, and yet she could not bear to see him as affectionate toward others as he had been to her. Was it jealousy? No. She was only a child, endowed simply with the feelings and the discriminating faculty of a child. And yet when he had told her that Hannah had become his bride-when she saw how the latter leaned upon his shoulder and he lovingly ingly looked down upon her happy face-when she heard him call that bride, "sweet, lovely, and dear," the child's mind at once grew fertile with a woman's thoughts. She took a right conception of the situation. She saw, felt, and knew that she had been supplanted in his affection-that he loved some one else-that he had taken unto himself a bride. Never before had such a thought entered her mind. Did she wish to become his bride? No. She would have laughed and hooted at such an idea. She had been satisfied and happy with what she was-had believed him also satisfied-and never for a moment imagined a change in their relationship would or could be effected. 
                  Firm in this illusion, the little girl had dreamed herself happy. But no sooner had the veil been rent apart, than a poignant pain shot through her young heart and made her feel as if she had been discarded, cast aside, torn ruthlessly from the shrine upon which she thought alone to have the right to sacrifice. Was not Edgar her own Edgar? Had he not always loved her, and had she not always loved him? What right had Hannah now to thrust herself between them? Were there not plenty other persons in the world to love? Why must she just love him? Was it not wrong to steal from the poor, little girl all she had on earth? She (Ruth) never was selfish-she never wanted to be his bride, she was always satisfied with what she had been-she had given everybody privilege to love him-never wanted him alone, entirely alone. What right had Hannah to keep him alone-all alone? 
                  None, none, none! So thought Ruth, and could have poisoned anyone who would have tried to make her believe otherwise. 
                  When, therefore, Edgar had called her, from the corner into which she had retired, to his side, and asked her for the reason of her sullenness, she could have cried for anger. What I had he been so blind as not to have guessed the reason-that she loved him? 
                  Yes, she could have wept for anger; and would have wept, had not Hannah, at the same time, laid her head upon his shoulder, and smilingly looked up into his beautiful face. 
                  It maddened Ruth. It seemed to her, as if Hannah had read her feelings, and was now mocking and defying them. O, that smile! that smile! she could not bear to see it. All the kindness she had ever received from the hands of the Prestons were forgotten in the contemplation of that smile. And Edgar was saying to her-to her!-it madened her-"Come and be merry. See how happy your sister Hannah is-she is doubly your sister now. She loves your brother Edgar-loves him much and ardently-do you not, my dear?" 
                  "Do you not, my dear?-my dear?" 
                  She had heard enough. What else could cause her more misery? 
                  We have seen how, leopard-like, she had leaped toward Hannah, and madly scratched her face. At the same moment her eyes had beheld the blood issuing from the lovely face which her nails had sorely aggravated. 
                  Terrified at what she had done, and fearing the consequences, she rushed from the room-from the house. 
                  When Edgar, a few minutes later, looked after her, he could not find her. He searched for her all over the house and in the garden, but he searched in vain. It was only at the expiration of an hour that a servant entered the drawing-room, and stated that Ruth had then sought her sleeping apartment and at once retired. 
                  On the following morning, Edgar, after breakfast, told Ruth to follow him into the hall. 
                  "Ruth, what was the matter with you last night?" he said, taking hold of her hand and stroking her long raven hair. "You have acted strangely, very strangely, toward your sister Hannah. You deserve a reprimand, Ruth; but this having been the first time that you have forgotten yourself toward one to whom you owe so much happiness, I will pass it over, hoping that you will give me no further occasion to disapprove of your conduct." 
                  Ruth's head was lowered over her bosom and her eyes were searching the floor. 
                  "Have you nothing to say?" he continued, after a short pause, struck with her unusual taciturnity. "Why were you and why are you still out of humor? Has any one hurt your feelings? Come, cheer up, my child, and let us seek my beloved Hannah, and I shall beg her to forgive you for your last night's conduct." 
                  Sooner than see Hannah for that purpose, she would have died on the spot. Should she ask pardon? For what? Because Hannah had taken her own Edgar from her? Is it for that? 
                  A frown shot over her youthful brow. 
                  "I don't want to see Hannah," she said, sulkily. "I hate her." She emphasized "hate," and uttered it in a kind of a guttural voice. Edgar was quite surprised at the bitterness of this expression. Was it, perhaps, that the little girl felt herself slighted in some way? He would ask:-he was determined to find it out. 
                  "My child," he commenced, drawing her nearer to him, "sit by me and tell me why you don't want o see Hannah?" 
                  "Because." 
                  "Because why?" 
                  After Edgar had failed to elicit an answer, he continued: 
                  "You remain silent, Ruth, and suffer my question to go unheeded. Do I deserve this treatment at your hands? Have I not always been kind and good to you? Come, my little sister, tell me what's the matter with you?" 
                  "Nothing." 
                   
                  "Nothing? Why, then, are you so downcast?" 
                  "Because I hate Hannah." 
                  "Fie, fie, Ruth! What has your sister Hannah done to you that you should hate her?" 
                  "She is no sister of mine; I have no sister;" she replied, still looking toward the floor. 
                  "You are cross this morning." 
                  "I don't care if I am." 
                  "Ruth, I am much grieved to see you conduct yourself so naughtily." 
                  He said nothing else. He released her hand, rose from his seat, and retired into the library, where a gentleman, a stranger, awaited him. Soon the object of his visit was made known, after which, both entered in a conversation which lasted but a short time, when they went together into the hall, Edgar calling for Ruth. 
                  The little girl came slowly from the drawing-room. She had been weeping-her eyes were still red. 
                  "Sister Ruth," commenced Edgar, "look up and see whether or not you know this gentleman," pointing toward the stranger by his side. 
                  She raised her swarthy face, and, as she did so, encountered the eyes of the stranger. An exclamation of joy, bordering almost on madness, escaped her lips, and she rushed into the stranger's outstretched arms. 
                  "Uncle! uncle! where have you been so long?" and she fairly succumbed to the emotion of joy this unexpected arrival had awakened in her bosom. 
                  It was the gentleman who had left her at Mr. Armhold's some four years ago, promising to return for her after the lapse of a few months. 
                  Ruth had not forgotten him. He had come to her like a God-send at this moment. Never before in her life had she felt as joyful as now. Before the stranger had time to speak to her, she said, amid sobs and sighs, "O, why have you staid away so long? O, I'm so glad you've come. You won't leave me again, I know you won't leave me again. I'm so happy-I'm so happy!" 
                  "No, no, my dear," the stranger said, affectionately; "I shall never leave you more. To-morrow, I shall take you away from here-take you home." 
                  "Home! Where is my home?" she said, looking bewildered. 
                  "Your home is far, far from here-far across the deep, deep waters. Will you go with me?" 
                  "Yes, yes! O, take me away now!" she pleaded. 
                  The stranger raised his eyes toward Edgar's face. 
                  "Ruth seems anxious to leave," he said, a bitter smile hovering around his lips. 
                  "It seems so. May she be happy in the new home that awaits her!" replied Edgar, throwing an affectionate glance at his little foster-sister. 
                  Ruth looked into her foster-brother's eyes: they were tearful. 
                  "O, Edgar," she exclaimed, "go along with us!" and she threw herself before his feet. "I won't go unless you go," she continued. "You have been so good to me-O, so good!-while I have been so naughty!" and she sobbed aloud. 
                  Edgar stooped and raised the weeping girl to her feet. 
                  "Weep not, my sister," he said, wiping away her tears and impressing a kiss upon her brow. "You have always been a good girl-a very good girl. So, cease weeping. Your kind uncle wishes to see you laugh-not cry. He has come to return you to your home, my little sister. Will you sometimes think of me-of your brother Edgar?" 
                  This was more than the little girl could stand. Until now she had scarcely realized the situation in which she had been placed. To leave! to go away from her Edgar! The very thought terrified her. How could she live without him? Hannah was forgotten in that moment. Edgar had spoken to her in that gentle tone to which she had been accustomed to listen for years, and she was happy again. She was just about to answer that she would not leave him-that she would stay here in preference to her home to which her uncle wanted to take her so soon-when Hannah made her appearance, and, placing her arm in Edgar's, fondly looked into his eyes. 
                  "Hannah," commenced Edgar, "permit me to introduce to you Mr. Norton, Ruth's uncle," turning toward the gentleman introduced. "Mr. Norton, my intended wife, Miss Preston." 
                  "Please walk into the drawing-room," she said; and they left the hall. Ruth did not follow them. 
                  It was about ten o'clock when Mr. Norton departed, promising to return on the following morning to take away his little niece. Edgar accompanied him to the city. They had not been gone fifteen minutes when Carrie Harrington was announced. 
                  "Is Miss Preston in?" she inquired. 
                  "Yes; she is in the drawing-room." 
                  Without saying another word, she entered. Hannah had not seen her cousin for some time. She rose from her chair and advanced toward the door. 
                  "Carrie, how do you do?" she said, reaching out her hand. 
                  "I am well." She did not accept the proffered hand, but at once walked to a seat, upon which she threw herself. Hannah's eye uneasily followed her. 
                  "Cousin Carrie," she said, "let me help you to remove your bonnet and shawl." 
                  Carrie looked as pale as death, and sadness sat upon those cheeks which were once so blooming. 
                  "Hannah!" 
                  A pause ensued when she 
                   
                   
                  "Hannah, look at me! Do you still recognize me?" She turned her haggard face toward her cousin. 
                  "Carrie, why should I not recognize you?" replied the other, sympathizing with her cousin, whom she supposed to have been sick. "You look somewhat pale. Have you been sick long?" 
                  "Sick!" Carrie exclaimed, and shook her head in sadness. "Sick!" She looked so wretched that Hannah, with tears in her eyes, bowed down for the purpose of pressing a kiss upon her lips. 
                  "Don't!" said Carrie, shoving her off. A moment afterward she said: "Hannah, is this your honesty, your friendship, your love?" 
                  "What?" inquired the other, astonished. 
                  "I have heard that Edgar Armhold is to become your husband. Have I heard aright?" 
                  Hannah blushed. 
                  "Mr. Armhold and I," she said, "are betrothed to one another." 
                  A bitter smile curled Carrie's lips. 
                  "Did you not know that I loved that man? Have I not told you, a thousand times, that I lived and breathed only for him? And have you not promised never to interfere between the person I love and myself? O, Hannah, Hannah! had you killed me, I should have thanked you for it. But this-this that you have done, I shall never forgive, never forget while I live! You have robbed me of what I most loved on earth; you have extinguished the light of my hope; and my future will be darker than the darkest cave of night, and more miserable and aimless than it is dark! Listen!" and she pointed her pale, thin, trembling indexfinger at her in a meaning, threatening manner-"Listen! You may marry the man of whom you robbed me-you may marry him; but, as there is a God above our head, you shall be more miserable with him than even I without him, though death were preferable to my doom! Hear me, Hannah! I do not threaten: I am cool and collected, and know what I speak: you shall rue the day you ever robbed me of Edgar Armhold!" 
                  Without waiting for an answer, Carrie Harrington, more like an apparition than a human being, glided from the room, followed by the eyes of the swooning bride. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXXII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              And now farewell! farewell! I dare not lengthen 
                              These sweet, sad moments out; to gaze on thee 
                              Is bliss, indeed, yet it but serves to strengthen 
                              The love that now amounts to agony; 
                              This is our last farewell. 
                           
                         
                        MRS. WELBY. 
                      
                   
                  AS promised, Mr. Norton on the following day returned from the city, for the purpose of taking away his little niece from the Prestons. With him came Edgar, whose welcome guest he had been, and from whom he had learned, during his short stay, the main particulars of Ruth's conduct since she had been left, a total stranger, at Mr. Emil Armhold's. 
                  It was still early in the morning when they rung the bell and subsequently were conducted by a servant into the reception room. They had been there but a short time when Mr. Preston, being informed of their arrival, left his library, and joined the new comers for the purpose of wishing them "a good-morning," and to entertain them until his wife or Hannah should make her appearance. 
                  The conversation into which they fell, having no interest whatever to the reader and being entirely foreign to this tale, it is unnecessary to chronicle. They discussed simply the common topics of the day, though Mr. Preston, more than once, made different remarks concerning little Ruth, that nothing save the unusual wariness on the part of Mr. Norton himself and the taciturnity exhibited on this subject by Edgar, prevented him from discovering something in regard to his charge and her future destiny. Fully aware that he had been understood by Mr. Norton, and not desiring to be thought rude in attempting to press an answer from the lips that were unwilling to impart it, he suffered the conversation to take its natural course, satisfied, that in due time he would be made acquainted with all and every thing he, by virtue of the position he had held toward Ruth for some time, had a right to know. 
                  Soon the principal members of the family made their appearance and joined the early visitors in the reception-room. 
                  "Where is sister Ruth?" inquired Edgar of his bride, who had already ran to his side. "Where is she?" he continued. "Mr. Norton will have but little time to spare." 
                  "Why, Edgar, is Ruth, then, leaving us in earnest?" she asked in return, scarcely realizing the state of affairs. "Can't Mr. Norton suffer her to stay with us at least until we have had time to consider this matter, and become better prepared for the departure? Indeed, Edgar, I deem this an unusually hasty proceeding-don't you?" 
                  Edgar smiled as he turned his calm brow toward the uplifted face of his lovely bride and said: 
                  "I must confess, it is rather a hasty proceeding. But Mr. Norton has but little time to stay in this city. It is for our little sister's good that she should depart at once, and we, loving her as we do from our whole heart, must submit, only praying that the future may have no misery in store for her. But where is she?" he continued, interrupting himself, "where is she? She ought to get ready. Mr. Norton should not be kept waiting long: he must be gone in an hour at the very latest." 
                  "Shall I see where little sister is?" she inquired of him. 
                   
                  "Please, do, my love." 
                  Hannah excused herself, and left the reception-room. Noiselessly she glided through the hall, then up a flight of stairs, then through another hall, at the further end of which she stopped before a door, and gently knocked for admittance. Not being answered from the inside, and having waited several moments, she slowly turned the knob and entered. 
                  On a little stool, in the corner of the room, sat little Ruth, with her back toward the hall and her face toward the wall. We don't know whether or not she had heard the slight rapping at the door or the subsequent entrance of Hannah. We only know that she neither turned her head around, nor stirred in the least, as Hannah, standing in the aperture of the door, for a moment gazed upon the little girl she had so soon to part with, whom she had learned to love as a sister. 
                  Satisfied that she might stay there a whole hour without attracting the little maiden's attention, Hannah, without further ceremony, closed the door behind her, and, crossing the floor, approached her little foster-sister. 
                  "Ruth!" 
                  The little girl moved not-stirred not. 
                  "Ruth!" 
                  It had not more effect than if she had not called at all. 
                  Hannah drew a little nearer. 
                  "Ruth!" after a short pause-"sister Ruth!" 
                  This time she was more successful. The little girl partly turned around upon her chair, and raised her face. How strange and how vague it looked! Was this the face of a child? How intelligent in its serenity! How dark and gloomy, and yet how calm and thoughtful! And then those large black eyes-how much they spoke, and how little they were understood! Not a tear was in them-not a drop of water seemed ever to have flowed over their mysterious surface. Unfathomable depths of darkness! Thought and feeling wrapped in the shades of midnight! 
                  "Sister Ruth!" 
                  She looked up and saw the lovely face of Hannah bent over her. A frown-a dark, dark frown crossed her childish brow. Could she not see how beautiful Hannah was, and was it not on account of that beauty that she had become so indescribably wretched? 
                  "What do you want?" she said sulkily, again lowering her head, and turning toward the wall. 
                  Hannah observed her for a moment, and sympathized with her little foster-sister, whose sulkiness she mistook for sadness, believing that the knowledge of her speedy departure had occasioned this great depression of spirit. Therefore, she refrained from chiding her for this short and almost abrupt remark, and for the coolness she exhibited in meeting her on this, the last hour they, perhaps, would ever have an opportunity of hearing each other's voice-of meeting and seeing one another on earth. 
                  "Your uncle is below, sister," continued Hannah, in a subdued, affectionate tone of voice-"he has but little time to spare. Edgar said, that you had to leave this morning. Let us now go down stairs, Ruth, and hear what your uncle wants of you." 
                  Ruth rose from her chair and, without looking at Hannah, advanced toward the door. 
                  "Ruth!" 
                  She turned around and their eyes met. For a moment neither the one nor the other uttered a syllable. Like two combatants they faced each other. Hannah wore an expression of sadness and reproach, while little Ruth seemed to wear an armor of perversity and bitterness. 
                  "Ruth come here!" 
                  The little girl stopped, and sullenly raised her eyes from the carpeted floor. 
                  "What do you want?" she said, slowly retracing her steps. 
                  "I want you to come here and sit down a moment or so by me. Your feelings are changed toward me-don't think that I have not noticed it," she continued, after Ruth had placed herself alongside of her-"yes, don't think that I am not aware of it. You have conducted yourself quite naughtily since my betrothal-quite naughtily. Edgar, my dear Edgar, has also noticed it, and would, had he followed my counsel, have reprimanded you for it. What reason had you to scratch my face? To be sulky and taciturn? Have I-has Edgar deserved this of you? Do you know he is much grieved by it?" 
                  Ruth raised her swarthy face and dark dreamy eyes inquiringly toward the calm, cold brow of the other, and remarked in a tone full of sadness: 
                  "Is he much grieved at my conduct?" 
                  "He is much so, for his heart tells him that you do not treat him right. You should not be unmindful of the many services he has rendered you. I shall not speak at all of the obligations you are under to my pa and ma. I thought gratitude toward them would have taught you how to conduct yourself a few hours previous to your departure. Whatever, or whoever it may be that has nettled you, can not be of such importance as to justify this unreasonable sulkiness. You are ungrateful." 
                  "You are ungrateful!" Ruth heard these words, and the red life-blood rushed to her face. They fell upon her ears like the unexpected report of an overloaded pistol, and sank into her young heart like a thunderbolt. "You are ungrateful!" She ungrateful! She to be accused of ingratitude! She who would have died for Edgar, as she had lived for and through him! "You are ungrateful!" She could not forget these words. They expressed something more than she could understand. 
                  She stared at Hannah, with the stare of a being who is nonplussed-who has been brought to bay. Never in her young life had she felt so defenseless-so at the mercy of any one. She was quite dumb-founded. Should she weep? Should she smile? Or should she get angry? She could have done a little of either, but most of the first. Yes, she could have wept, and would have wept, had she not raised her eyes to Hannah's severe face, which had the effect of changing her nature and reversing her feelings. In anger she sent back the tears that were already meandering toward the brim. Darker and darker became her face, and brighter and brighter grew her eyes, like those of the serpent, measuring the distance between itself and the object of its hate. What right had Hannah to call her ungrateful-she who had robbed her of Edgar's love? Why must she charge her of ingratitude just when it was her intention to descend to the hall and thank the whole household for the many kindnesses she had received of them during her sojourn at Avondale, and to ask pardon-a thousand pardons-for the many offenses she must have committed during that time? Why must she bring that charge now? Was it done for the purpose of depriving her of the chance of showing her gratitude? How could she now go down stairs and do as she had intended? Would it not be considered by Hannah as only the result of the admonition given by her? 
                  A frown darkened Ruth's youthful brow. She felt herself wronged, greatly wronged, and that too by the very being who had robbed her of her Edgar. She wanted revenge-she had sought for it-she must and would have it. Had not Hannah done all this to wound her feelings, to crush her heart? To be sure she had. She had delighted in tormenting her; so, at least, thought the unconsciously jealous Ruth. 
                  We can still remember the emerald which Hannah had presented to her one evening under a willow-tree. The little girl had worn it on her finger ever since. Now she pulled it off and threw it into Hannah's face, and then ran from the room, but not until she had hissed (if a child has the power of hissing): 
                  "I wish Edgar had never saved your life! I wish the fire had consumed you! O, I wish it-I do wish it!" 
                  "Leave me!" exclaimed Hannah, her stern features assuming a severity unusual even on her cold, icy face. But Ruth did not hear the remark nor see the expression; she had already rushed from the room. 
                  When Hannah got down stairs, she found the carriage, which was to take Mr. Norton and his little niece back to the city, before the door. Edgar was in the garden, slowly walking up and down the graveled path. He looked somewhat depressed, and anxiety was palpably written on every lineament of his face. Sometimes he raised his eyes, directing them toward the coach, into which some of the servants were depositing little Ruth's baggage. 
                  "All's ready, Mr. Armhold," cried John, as the last parcel passed through his hands. 
                  Edgar drew a long breath, and slowly returned to the house. In the drawing-room Mr. Norton and the whole Preston family were assembled-but Ruth was not there. After leaving her room, she had glided down stairs and seated herself on the steps that led into the garden at the rear of the house. 
                  "Ruth!" echoed through the hall. 
                  She knew the sound of that voice-it was Edgar's. She rose, looked once more over the garden in which she had strolled so often by the side of her foster-brother, and then went into the drawing-room. 
                  "Ruth, it is time for us to take our departure," admonished Mr. Norton, her uncle. "I want you now to express your thanks and gratitude to these, your warm friends, promising never to forget them, nor the kindnesses which they have so plenteously lavished upon you. You must also tell them that the time may come when even Ruth can show the gratitude of her heart in something more convincing than in empty words." 
                  Mr. Norton had scarcely finished his last sentence before little Ruth commenced bidding farewell to some of the members of the family. Mr. and Mrs. Preston, who had truly loved the little girl, shook her hand warmly, and expressed their great grief at her departure. They admonished her to be good, and not to forget them; begged her to write to them often, and assured her she should frequently hear from them. The little girl listened calmly to every thing. There was a peculiar indifference, an unusual apathy expressed in her face. Not a tear came to her eyes. They were as dry as her features were calm and set, and each lacked expression, life, and animation. It was only when she had come face to face with Hannah, that, as if by magic, she became transformed. Her head, which had been doggedly lowered, was now defiantly raised; and those eyes of black, which, a few moments before, were wanting in life and animation, began to glisten like those of the serpent, ready to charm its feathered victim for the purpose of devouring it. The blood had rushed to her cheeks and dyed them a deep crimson. Her lips, of a still deeper hue than her cheeks, were closely compressed, and wove an expression of pride and hatred over that dark and thoughtful face. 
                  At that moment, like a flash of lightning, the truth darted across Hannah's mind. She had discovered the key to this mysterious conduct. 
                  
                     Ruth was jealous of Edgar's love! It could not be any thing else-was not any thing else. Hannah was only astonished that she had not thought of it sooner. It must be confessed that she had been no less vexed than perplexed at the undisguised rudeness of the little girl, to whom she had given no cause to feel offended. But now, as the truth flashed across her mind, all her anger toward the little girl ceased, and a smile-a harmless smile-stole to her lips, and dimpled her rosy cheeks. Ruth observed it, and thought that Hannah was smiling simply to aggravate her in the last moments before her departure. 
                  She could have burst for anger. Just then a wicked thought must have crossed her mind, for she clenched her fist, bit her lips, drew together her eyebrows, and partly closed the eyelids, from underneath which a sinister glance darted forth. 
                  "Sister Ruth," said Hannah, extending her arm, "let us shake hands, and part as friends. I love you, sister Ruth, and hope that you will love me in return. When you are gone, you must not forget me. Always think of me as a sister-a sister who would-" 
                  Just then Edgar walked up to them, and, taking his bride's hand, said, in an undertone: 
                  "Mr. Norton is waiting on you, Ruth." 
                  She needed no second warning. She hastened to the side of her uncle, Edgar and Hannah following. Now all the members of the family rose, and jointly went with the departing into the yard, where the domestics of the house, who had also learned to love the little girl, waited, with tears in their eyes, to say good-by to her. 
                  "Ruth!" It was almost said in a whisper. She heard it, however, and raising her head, beheld Edgar, standing behind her. Though he had spoken but little to her during the whole morning, yet she had seen how his eyes had followed her wherever she moved. Now those eyes looked down upon her with that expression of sadness she had known them to assume when looking at his blind mother. 
                  "Ruth!" 
                  She felt some one take hold of her hand. It was Edgar. "They are not quite ready yet," he said, gently, and then led her back into the drawing-room. It was entirely deserted. He took a seat upon a divan and lifted little Ruth upon his lap. Slyly she lowered her head upon his bosom. 
                  "Ruth, my love," he whispered, visibly moved by the bitter emotions of his heart, "I part with you in more than sorrow. We have been together so long-have loved each other so much-and now you are about to go away from your Edgar, and he will no longer have a sister who will love him." 
                  He ceased speaking-something seemed to choke him. Ruth looked up and encountered his eyes. They were swimming in tears, and sadness hovered on his pale, pale cheeks. She saw it, and the memory of past days came back to her. 
                  "O, Edgar, Edgar!" she sobbed, twining her arms around his neck and pressing a kiss upon his lips, "I love you better than Hannah ever did or ever will-do not marry her-O, do not marry her," she continued to plead, "but wait for me, for your little Ruth, she will not always be a little girl-she, too, will grow up to be a woman, and then-and then-O, Edgar, Edgar, do not marry Hannah Preston," and the poor girl began to sob as if her young heart was breaking in her bosom. 
                  Just then a servant entered, informing Edgar that all was was ready, and that Mr. Norton was waiting for them.

                              When two that are linked in heavenly tie, 
                              Love on through all ills, and love on till they die. 
                           
                         
                        MOORE. 
                      
                   
                  RUTH had gone away, and Edgar had returned to the city an hour before dark. He had felt unusually sad and depressed in spirit ever since his little foster-sister's departure, and now, as the shades of night were falling over the deserted streets, he might have been seen, slowly and alone, making his way toward the outskirts of the city, absorbed in thought. After a walk of something like thirty minutes, he stopped in front of a small cottage. We have once before seen him enter the same humble abode. It was the home of Joseph Joseph, or-as Edgar always called him-of "father Joseph." The old man was seated erect in his straight, wooden arm-chair, and as his youthful visitor entered, was gazing abstractedly at the few coals in the hearth, over which a sickly flame was struggling with a thick gray smoke, which was enveloping and trying to exterminate it. 
                  He had not heard the light footfalls of his new comer. He sat there-a type of the last century-a relic, a representative of the past-a slave to old age, benumbed in spirit, mind, and body. He belonged more to the dead than to the living. Little interest bound him to this world. His generation had died out-and, with it, its forms and customs. What had he in common with the rising generation? Nothing. He knew and felt it. The past, to which he belonged, was all he cared for-was all he had-was all with which he busied his mind the long, long days through. He brooded-unconsciously brooded-over it from morning until night, and again from night until morning. He lived for nothing else. He was totally absorbed in and by it. He had arrived at that stage of life when every thing grows indifferent to man-when the profoundest apathy takes possession of the soul-when all the passions seem to have quieted down in him-when nothing more can move him and scarcely leave the least impression upon his mind, which is decorated with the pictures drawn there for the period of seventy years and more. And yet, at times, as if by an electric flash, father Joseph would throw off his lethargy-this drowsiness-and the fire of life would again blaze in his eyes as it had done in the days of his youth and vigor, and words of wisdom would flow from his tongue with that calmness, and deliberation, and evenness of temper which are the fruits of experience and age, and have power alike to command respect, to charm, to subdue and to convince. But such moments were as ephemeral as they were lucid, and were generally followed by a greater mental darkness than that from which it had, like a meteor, shot forth, throwing him again into a state of abstraction-in a torpor that resembled life, looking through the glassy eyes of death. 
                  When Edgar had entered the room he found Joseph Joseph in such a state of apathy. For a moment he gazed upon that patriarchal form, with its snow-white hair and flowing beard, then noiselessly drew a chair toward the hearth, and seated himself upon it. 
                  "Father Joseph!" fell from Edgar's lips. 
                  The hoary-headed sage slowly withdrew his gaze from the flickering flames upon which it had been fixed for nearly an hour, and turned it upon the calm, pale student by his side; then, as if only partly aroused from his torpor, he again withdrew his glance, and, after nodding his head once or twice, lowered it upon his bosom. 
                  Edgar drew nearer, taking the old man's hand into his. 
                  "Father Joseph-look up, father Joseph!" 
                  The old man raised his head, and with a bewildered look gazed upon his visitor. The familiar sound of his young and faithful friend's voice-had the effect to remove for a moment that feeling of drowsiness, and infuse a spirit of life into him. 
                  "Is it you, Edgar Armhold?" 
                  "It is, father," said the youth, over whose thoughtful brow the flickering flame in the hearth threw a pale sickly hue. "I have come to bring you some news-news that will fill you with surprise and pleasure." 
                  "News? News?" echoed back the old man in a feeble voice, and, as he did so, a pang shot through Edgar's breast, who, an unaccountable sadness taking possession of his soul, replied: 
                  "Yes, father, it is news. I am betrothed-Edgar Armhold is betrothed, father." 
                  A faint smile curled the old man's lips, and an expression of joy transfigured that somber, august face into one of unearthly beatitude. 
                  "Betrothed to whom?" he inquired, eagerly. 
                  "To Miss Hannah Preston." 
                  Joseph Joseph said nothing in reply. His features expressed neither wonder nor surprise. He simply gazed at the pale student, over whose face the flickering flame still threw that pale, sickly hue. Gradually father Joseph's face lost its unearthly beatitude, the smile fled his lips and cheeks, his brow became serene and thoughtful-his whole face underwent a change and grew sad-very sad. 
                  "To Miss Hannah Preston," he muttered to himself, after a short pause, and again lowered his head upon his bosom. 
                  "Father Joseph!" but father Joseph did not answer-he had fallen into one of his reveries, from which it was a difficult task to arouse him. 
                  Edgar was dreadfully depressed in spirit. He could not account for the strange thoughts that would rise up, phantom-like, and obtrude themselves upon his mind. He tried to shake off the sad impression they had left, but at every effort he discovered the uselessness of the attempt. He heard the clock strike nine, ten, eleven-twelve, and still he sat there, busy with his own thoughts, now mechanically gazing at the weird-like face of the old, hoary-headed sage, and now watching the dark gray smoke issuing from the few dying embers in the hearth. 
                  He rose from his chair, looked once more around the room, then approached the door. He was just turning the knob, when a sigh escaped from the old man's bosom. Edgar retraced his steps, and taking the old man's hand into his own, softly whispered: 
                  "You have been dozing, father. Shall I help you to retire?" 
                  "No, Edgar, no." He raised his head, and for a moment looked steadfastly into the sad face of the youth kneeling by his side, then continued: "Go home, my boy, and sleep in peace; I will not trouble you with helping me. 'Tis late, and I shall not keep you longer. To-morrow come and see me, for I have to impart to you a secret, which must not die with me; and as I feel my last hour drawing nigh, I charge you, by the love you bear me, by your happiness which is at stake, not to disappoint me in this meeting, but come at early dawn, and if, after what I shall have confided to you, you will still be intent upon marrying Hannah Preston, then prepare yourself with sackcloth and ashes, for your mourning shall be as deep as the ocean and everlasting as time." 
                  Edgar smiled sadly. The past came back to his memory, and a tear stole to his eyes. 
                  "Not marry Hannah Preston?" he repeated. "Why?" 
                  "Ask me no more at present, for it is a long, long tale that I have to unfold to you, and we are already in the very heart of night," and he rose from his chair, straight and erect like some well-grown pine, and pointed his index-finger at the slowly ticking clock on the wall. "Go home," he continued, in a solemn voice,-"go home, for Joseph Joseph would now retire." 
                  So saying, he once more lowered himself upon the chair, and directed his eyes toward the moon, whose ghastly face, as 'twas seen through the window, seemed to possess a mysterious attraction for the awe-inspiring silver-headed old man. Edgar thoughtfully gazed upon the beautiful wreck of human nature for a moment, then, his eyes growing a shade sadder and darker, and his face putting on an expression of resignation and humility, unconsciously breathed a sigh, and placing his hat upon his head noiselessly glided from the room. When he had returned to the city and was once more seated in his own apartment, with nothing save his books and manuscripts around him, strange thoughts crowded upon his mind and made him uneasy and pensive. Again and again he would hear the admonishing voice of the old man-"Do not marry Hannah Preston!" and again and again he would attempt to throw off that feeling of doubt and apprehension that had taken possession of his soul. It struck two-all was quiet in his room-in the house-on the street, and still he sat there, with his pale face turned toward the twinkling stars, unconscious of the lateness of the hour. Now this, now that, came back to his memory; now he gazed upon the mirror of his childhood, now he pondered over Reuben and Reuben's fate, and now upon Ruth and her destiny, and so on, until he at last was lost in a loose and irregular train of thinking, from which he awoke only as the clock of the neighboring church pealed forth the hour of six. Then he started up from his chair, and placed his hand across his brow, as if to collect his thoughts that had scattered themselves too far over the field of fancy. 
                  It was nearly seven when he left his apartment and turned his steps toward Joseph Joseph's cottage, in order to filfill his appointment, and hear the secret that was to have so much to do toward shaping his own destiny. Having eventually arrived at the cottage, he first gently tapped on the door, but discovering no signs of having been heard and knowing that it sometimes required a strong effort to arouse the aged inmate when too much absorbed in thought, Edgar applied his fist several times to the door with a force that threatened to effect the desired end without the assistance of any key. But he was mistaken. 
                  He kept on knocking for something like five minutes without success. Though he had applied also his heels to the door, still Joseph Joseph gave no signs of having heard the summons. Edgar became uneasy-a thought of fear flashed across his mind. "Could he have gone out?" he murmured to himself. "Could he have forgotten this appointment? No; he had attached too great an importance to it; besides, he never does forget." 
                  Again he applied both his fists and heels to the door, but again with no more success than had attended his previous attempts. "Something must have happened to the old man," apprehended Edgar; and being fully impressed with this idea, he hurried down the street in search of a locksmith, whom he found a few minutes later, and took him along for the purpose of unlocking the door, which task being accomplished, the frightened Edgar, with a palpitating heart, rushed into the room, which had still the same appearance as when he had left it on the night previous. There were all the papers, books, and manuscripts precisely where he had seen them like; and there-right there sat Father Joseph, on his big wooden arm-chair, erect as a pine, his silver locks hanging loosely over his serene forehead-his eyes wide open, still directed toward the sky. There he sat, with the same awe-inspiring, grave, and peace-expressive countenance which he had seen on the previous night. The old man had evidently not retired as he had intended to do-had not even stirred. 
                  Edgar noiselessly approached the chair, and whispered, in a subdued voice: 
                  "Father Joseph! I am here-Edgar Armhold is here. He has come according to promise." 
                  The old man did not move, and yet his eyes were wide open, as if he were fully awake. Edgar looked into them, and thought they spoke to him. 
                  "Father Joseph! why do you not answer me? Arouse yourself, and let your Edgar hear you welcome him." 
                  As he said this, he took the old man's hand, and just as quickly dropped it. 
                  It was as cold as ice. 
                  
                     Edgar was in the presence of the dead! Joseph Joseph had died during the night-and, with him, the secret he had intended to reveal. 
                  Edgar closed the dead philosopher's eyes, pressed a last kiss upon those cold lips, even faintly smiling in death, and, with tears upon his cheeks, retired from the room. 
                  It was only the second evening after this sad event that Edgar felt the least inclination to show himself in society again. On the previous day he had informed his bride, by note, of what had transpired, at the same time stating that he should "take pleasure in calling on her as soon as the necessary arrangements for the burial had been attended to, and the burial itself was over." Though the corpse of Joseph Joseph had been interred on the first day, yet Edgar was too much moved to leave his home for the purpose of calling on his bride until on the second evening after his aged friend's demise. 
                   
                  "How sad and changed you look!" exclaimed Hannah, who was standing at the door as her intended, dressed in full mourning, with his usual unaffected grace, ascended the few marble stiles, upon the topmost of which she had stood for nearly an hour, looking in the direction from which he had come. "I hope you have not been ill, Edgar," she continued, as they now walked, arm in arm, through the hall. 
                  "No, dearest," he replied, a faint smile playing around his thin lips; "I am quite well." 
                  "And yet you look so sad," she continued, gazing into his mournful eyes, "that I can not help thinking something ails you. May I not share your thoughts?" 
                  "I have nothing to conceal from you, dearest," he said; "for are you not to become my wife? and as such have you not a right to penetrate my heart? But, my dearest," he continued, more gravely, "is it not sometimes better to be satisfied with what we know-with what is told us willingly-than dive too deep into the soul in search of that which, when known, will prove to us a misery?" Then, as if not expecting a reply, he proceeded: "Remember that within these few days I have lost two friends: one, my little Ruth, whom I have loved as a sister; and the other-" here his large black eyes filled with tears-"Father Joseph, who comforted me when all the world forsook me-when sorrows and troubles oppressed my soul-when darkness obscured my vision-when despair took possession of my mind, and almost crazed me. Yes, I have lost these friends, dearest. Is it not natural that I should mourn, that I should weep for such losses?" 
                  "Let me fill the vacancy in your heart," she whispered, and lowered her head upon his bosom. 
                  "Hannah, now you are my all," he continued, in a low, musical voice; "yes, you are now my all! It is you who can make me either happy or wretched. May you bring me happiness!" 
                  "I trust in God that I may!" she lisped in return, lifting her eyes heavenward. 
                  They now turned into a path that led toward the garden to the rear of the mansion. Neither one nor the other uttered a syllable until they had reached a little oaken bench placed under a tall, weeping ash, the many branches of which almost touched the ground. 
                  "Let us sit down here, Hannah," said Edgar, softly, leading his bride toward the bench, which was almost concealed from sight. "Here, at least, we may speak to one another without fear of being intruded upon," he continued. Then, after a short pause, in which his pale face cleared up, and his eyes were confidingly turned toward his bride: "Hannah, I have come to speak to you-speak to you upon matters the importance of which can not be too highly estimated by either you or myself. Hannah, we are betrothed to one another-we are to become husband and wife. We have known each other long, and now imagine that we have learned to understand one another. I trust, Hannah-I do not speak now like a sickly lover portrayed in a novel-yes, I trust, Hannah, that the choice we have made, that this union between ourselves, will be a happy one, and that neither of us will have occasion to rue the hour in which we plighted our love. Courtship is sweet, Hannah, and while we drink our fill of bliss, our imagination soars in a rosy heaven, where not a cloud can mar the view of the lovely scene. We are apt to be blind, or, if not blind, still do attach too little importance to such traits in each other's character as come in conflict. I say, we are apt to be blind to these failings while we are under the influence of love and passion, not thinking that as we march on in life, when love becomes more tempered and passion subsides altogether, these failings, these ugly spots in our character are seen in their full proportion; and not unfrequently do we discover, when too late, how terrible, how heart-rending, how miserable is the fate of those who are doomed, for many long, long years, to partners whose disposition suits not their own; whose inclinations are continually opposing theirs; whose temperament they can not brook; whose character they can not respect. Weep not, Hannah, for I simply draw a picture found on every square, sometimes almost in every alternate house; but since we have admission simply to the parlor, where smiles abound, we neither suspect nor know of the jarring discord in the adjoining room. I love you, Hannah, and I am vain enough to believe that I am not altogether indifferent to you. O, Hannah, Hannah!" and here his sad voice rose a key-"tell me, tell me-O! tell me!-do you love me with your whole heart and soul? Will you bear with my shortcomings and teach me in kindness to get rid of my faults? I know I am not perfect-I am simply a human being-at best an erring creature. Remember, I have no father, no mother, no brother, no sister, to whom I could cling-to whom I could go for consolation-were my wife to become weary of her Edgar. O, Hannah, remember all this and bear with me. Live for me as I shall live for you. Let it be our daily study to increase each other's happiness. Let us make a paradise of home, and chiefly in that HOME seek true happiness. Let us be as one mind-as one thought-not in appearance only, but in reality. Let your wishes be mine and my wishes be yours, and the wishes of both be an outpouring of goodness. Hannah! Hannah! will you love me, and in your position as wife, remember that your shrine is around the hearth of home, there to preside, there to shine, there to exercise an influence for good over him who will, for your sake, dearest, enter more boldly and fearlessly into the path of literature, so he may gain for his wife a position of which she may be justly proud?" 
                  He threw himself upon his knees, and, his eyes dreamily raised toward his pale and weeping bride, said in a soft, pleading voice: 
                  "Will you, O, will you truly love me?" 
                  "Dearest Edgar," and she buried her face in his hands. 
                  
                     Who can read the future?
                   
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXXIV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              O, we do all offend- 
                              There's not a day of wedded life, if we 
                              Count at its close the little, bitter sum 
                              Of thoughts, and words, and looks unkind and froward, 
                              Silence that chides, and woundings of the eye- 
                              But prostrate at each other's feet, we should 
                              Each night forgiveness ask. 
                           
                         
                        MATURIN'S BERTHAM. 
                      
                   
                  EIGHTEEN months have elapsed since the departure of Ruth from the Prestons, and still not a letter had been received during this time either from herself or her relatives. At first this unexpected silence caused considerable uneasiness among those from whom she had been suddenly removed; but gradually, as the hours waxed into days, and the days into months, this uneasiness softened into indifference, until, after the expiration of eighteen months, she was scarcely ever thought of, except by Edgar, in whose memory she still had a seat-would have as long as life. Frequently he had written letters to her and to Mr. Norton to the address the latter had given him previous to his departure, but never was fortunate enough to elicit a reply. Now he had given up all hopes of ever hearing again of his little foster-sister, who, though scarcely ever spoken of or even mentioned by him, was never absent from his mind. Still he remembered her admonition: "Do not, O, do not marry Hannah Preston; I love you better than she ever did, or ever will;' and though at the time this was uttered it did not create in him the least feeling of apprehension, yet now-now, eighteen months later-now, after he had been married something like fifteen months to that lady, those words came back to his memory with their full meaning, making him sad and pensive. 
                  Was it a voice of prophecy that had fallen from the lips of little Ruth? 
                  He did not know; he only knew that it was the voice of truth-Hannah did not love him. Though the first few months of their married life had passed off as a happy dream, the succeeding ones brought about a change of feeling which was calculated soon to destroy-effectually destroy-the last vestige of their former love and happiness. 
                  After their marriage, which had been celebrated at her parents mansion-to which the Harringtons and many fashionable acquaintances had been invited-though scarcely any attended-they had moved to the city. Edgar had purchased a beautiful house and lot on Freeman-street, into which he had introduced his wife, and where he now lived. It was situated in a very aristocratic neighborhood; but despite his great wealth and still greater reputation as an author of fiction, few of his neighbors ever called upon himself or wife. He was too much occupied with his studies to pay the least attention to this neglect. He was engaged in writing a work upon which he intended to stake his reputation both as an author and thinker, and, therefore, if his wishes had been consulted, even the few that had come to see him would have remained away. 
                  With Hannah it was different. Raised as she had been in the choicest of society, she could not forget that, as the daughter of Mr. Preston, she was entitled to more attention than her neighbors were willing to bestow. This nettled her spirit, and made her still haughtier than she had been before. One day her mother came to see her, and after they had spoken for some time upon several important topics, Hannah said: 
                  "Mother, I have a good notion to move back to Avondale." 
                  "Why, daughter? I'm sure no better furnished house than you occupy can be found either in Cincinnati or Avondale. I can not conceive what should have put that notion into your head." 
                  Hannah haughtily raised her pale face, and, while something like a frown swept across her cold, stern brow, said: 
                  "I don't like the neighborhood." 
                  "The neighborhood? the neighborhood?" exclaimed her mother. "Where will you find a better one? Tell me, where?" and she looked inquiringly into her daughter's face. 
                  "I don't know, and I don't care." 
                  "How you do talk, Hannah!" 
                  "Mother, but two of my neighbors have visited me since I came here-'tis now over one year-and even they were here but once. When I meet any of them on the street they scarcely recognize me-it is all because I have married a Jew-I know it, mother; they look down upon me because I have married a Jew. Why, my own schoolmates have forsaken me. Imagine what sort of a life I lead; being neither Jew nor Christian, I am claimed by neither, and despised by both." 
                  "O, 'tis not quite so bad as you make it, daughter," added the mother, feeling, however, the truth of Hannah's assertion. 
                  "The other night I went to the Opera with Edgar, when some gentleman by my side whispered to his lady companion, 'This is Mr. Armhold, the author,' when she replied, 'They say he is only a Jew!' O, mother, when I heard this remark, I felt like sinking into the earth." 
                   
                  "But supposing she did say so-were you any the less for it?" 
                  "No, mother, I don't mean that. I know I am not the less for it; but then"-and here she rose from her seat and approached the window-"but then I'm none the more for it, neither. I am almost ashamed to meet any of my old acquaintances-I know they think me less-whether I am or not." 
                  "Hannah, you have a good-a loving husband; you should be happy. He is a man highly honored for his great, great talents; besides he is the father of your boy." 
                  "Mother"-and here she placed herself in front of Mrs. Preston-"mother, I know my husband is good and loves me; I also know that he has great talents, and daily achieves more honors. But, mother, however flattering this may be to a wife, it is not quite all she desires. She wants a husband who is welcome in every society, and with whom she may proudly pass along the streets." 
                  "And can you not do that?' inquired Mrs. Preston, fixing her eyes upon the cold, calm features of her daughter's face. 
                  "No." 
                  "No?" 
                  "No. Let a Jew be ever so intelligent, ever so refined, he is still a Jew. His ways and manners are different from ours, and always will be so. The distinction between Jew and Christian is visible on all occasions. They have nothing in common but their dislike. It was but yesterday he requested me to deny admittance to Rev. Doctor Broad-well." 
                  Rev. Doctor Broadwell was the minister of the congregation of which the Prestons and Harringtons were members. He was a handsome young man of five and twenty, a splendid orator, and considered by some a great theological scholar. For some months he had selected texts from the New Testament, which gave him good opportunities to hold up in his sermons the Jew as a being totally unworthy of respect-as a man void of honor, despised by God, and hated by the world. This Reverend Doctor had been introduced to Mrs. Armhold one day by her cousin Lionel, who seemed to have forgotten the past; and from that period Broadwell had become a frequent visitor at Edgar's house. 
                  "Yes," continued Hannah, still looking at her mother, "he had the courage to tell me not to admit the Rev. Doctor Broadwell, my spiritual adviser. Haven't I brought it far?" and here an ironic laugh escaped her thin, pale lips. "Hannah Preston is not allowed to entertain whomever she chooses!" 
                  She began hurriedly to pace up and down the floor, until the excitement under which she labored had abated a little. 
                  "But I'll show him that I am no toy to be played with," she continued a moment later. "Is it not enough that I must bear his name-is it not enough that I must feel myself separated from my people-is it not enough that I must abstain from going to church, or, going there, have continually the eyes of every person present riveted upon me? Yes, mother, I ask you is it not enough to have every one say 'this is a Jew's wife;' to have them to smile on me with contempt, that I should suffer him to drive away those few friends who would still cling to me? But, mother," and here she placed herself before the cradle in which her little boy lay sleeping, and haughtily elevated her figure, "I will show Edgar that I have a head of my own, and that I am determined to have my own way!" 
                  "Hannah! Hannah!" remonstrated her mother, earnestly, "to what will all this lead?" 
                  "I don't care-I am prepared for the worst. I have none to blame for what I have done-except myself and him (meaning Edgar.) He should have known that such would be the consequence." 
                  "Hannah, your husband loves both you and your child. I pray you take your mother's advice, and be satisfied with your lot. Edgar Armhold, though a Jew, is still a man, whose liberal principles, which the both advocates and lives up to, none can out admire and respect. I fear this Rev. Doctor Broadwell has poisoned your mind against your husband, and you have been too willing to listen to it. Hannah! Hannah! if you would not make yourself, your husband, and your darling boy miserable, drive away these thoughts from your mind, and remain a loving wife to your husband. He is, of course, a Jew-was when you married him-you can't make him anything else; be satisfied, daughter, with what he is." 
                  "I do not complain, mother," she said, at the same time looking down upon her baby boy, sleeping in the cradle. "I do not complain. At least my boy shall be a Christian; at least he shall comfort his mother. I shall have him baptized-I shall place him in the folds of Jesus-I shall make him a son of the Church." 
                  So saying she glanced at the sleeping child; then haughtily turning away, seated herself on a divan by the side of her mother, who now commenced to turn the conversation into a different channel, and as we deem the subject foreign to our tale, we shall leave them together, while we are making a flying visit to Clifton Avenue. 
                  We enter the house of Mrs. Harrington; no longer of Mr. Hugh Harrington. He had died soon after the marriage of Hannah, and had been followed by his many friends to his last resting-place, with that pomp and show that characterizes the burial of the rich. Many tears had been shed, alike by acquaintances, friends, and kin. It had been then, as now, fashionable to weep when the rich go to their final homes-consequently every body wept. The minister, in anticipation of a fat fee, had grown quite eloquent in the eulogy delivered over the dead man's grave, and sometimes he referred, in some touching remarks, to the fact that the deceased still lived-lived in his wife-lived in his children-who would perpetuate both his honor and his name. Mrs. Harrington had gone home to all appearances broken-hearted, dejected, overcome by the greatest grief imaginable, with the full determination to lock herself up in her room, exclude herself from society, and end her days in solitude and prayer. At first she suffered no one to enter the house of mourning, but soon she felt the necessity of consolation, and hence she wrote a little note to Mr. Netherland to come and grieve with her over her loss. Poor Mr. Netherland couldn't do any thing else but obey. He came, and his consolation was so much appreciated by the mourning widow, that she insisted upon his making a home of her house, which invitation he deemed it his duty to accept, if for nothing more than to watch over the afflicted lady, who seemed to desire much consolation for the loss of her husband. 
                  With Carrie it had been different. She had shed but few tears at her father's death, still in her face one had seen that though the eyes were dry, the heart within was bleeding. The first few months she scarcely ever left the house, or if she did it was simply to visit the city to make some necessary purchase. She had loved her father, and was the only one that had loved him; her mother and her brother never cared for the good old man. It was only after the marriage of Edgar with Hannah that a change in Carrie's life might have have been noticed. While she had only been sad before, she had become now very absent-minded and thoughtful, and as the days passed by she grew careless in attire and manners. She no longer cared how she was dressed-for what she was doing. She would sometimes lock herself up for weeks, descending to the hall simply to take her meals. Her brother was scarcely ever at home to notice it, or if at home, he was too much engrossed with his own affairs to have eyes for his sister. And her mother; how could the poor, inconsolable Mrs. Harrington think of her daughter? Was she not the greater sufferer of the two? Had she not lost her husband? And was it not all that Mr. Netherland could do to keep her from committing suicide? Reader! now imagine, if you can, the shock society received at the announcement, some three months after Harrington's death, that his inconsolable widow, without any notice whatsoever, had thrown herself under the protection of another man, and that man-Mr. Netherland. 
                  Let us not moralize over the effect of this proceeding on the outer world; let us simply see how Carrie took the news. When, one morning, Lionel, a strange, wild fire lighting up his eyes, told her of the fact, namely: that their mother had married Mr. Netherland and had left the city with him on a bridal tour, from which, however, they never returned, she simply smiled and said: 
                  "Well, why shouldn't she? Mr. Netherland will suit her better than our father ever did. I hope she may be happy with him." 
                  This marriage, however, grieved Carrie much more than she suffered even Lionel to perceive. It was enough to weary her of life. Her father dead; Edgar, whom she still loved beyond expression, married to her rival; and now her mother's deed of shame! 
                  We have stated that Carrie had become very careless in dress and manners. She grew indifferent to every thing else. One day she called her servant and sent her after wine. 
                  She drank, and forgot her griefs. She found relief, and smiled. From wine she eventually went to something stronger-to whisky. Sometimes she would brood over the past for hours, then she would rise, lock the door, open the bureau, and draw from it a bottle. "There's a way of driving off ugly thoughts," she would say as she swallowed the poisonous mixture. 
                  Carrie Harrington became a habitual drunkard. Carrie Harrington, the beautiful, the courted, the merry Carrie Harrington, became a sot. 
                  It was about this period that Lionel introduced his friend, Rev. Dr. Broadwell, into his house and to his sister. Previous to this introduction he had been made acquainted, by her brother, with the love Carrie had cherished for Mr. Armhold. 
                  "I'll cure her of that," he said, and a wicked smile shot over his beautiful features. 
                  Let us return once more to Cincinnati. It was an hour or so before the regular time of taking supper. Hannah was seated before a little work-table, but the canvas on which she had worked lay idly in her lap. Her head was resting on her hand, and her eyes were vaguely turned toward the landscape without, over which approaching eve was gradually throwing its dark and somber folds. She looked pale and thoughtful, and now and then she would slightly contract her brow, and a frown would flit across it. She sat in this position for nearly an hour, without moving her eyes from the window or in the least changing the expression of her countenance, when all at once a light footfall was heard in the hall, which aroused her from her reverie and brought a bitter smile upon her lips. Hastily she lifted the canvas from her lap and resumed drawing the crimson yarn through its perforations. 
                  The door turned upon its hinges, and in stepped, with stately mien, Edgar Armhold. Hannah raised not her head from her work; she had even no word of salutation for him. He moved toward a chair, placed his hand upon it, looked toward the being who had sworn to love him, and who had so soon forgotten the vow she had plighted. 
                  Let us for a moment gaze upon him, and see whether we can not discover any change in his looks since last we met him kneeling by the side of her who had since become his wife, and who had then promised to love him eternally. 
                  His face was still sad and his brow was still thoughtful, but with that sadness and thoughtfulness was blended an expression of resignation and sorrow, that struck the beholder with a kind of awe and sympathy-with a something in the aspect of the calm, pale features and wondrously intelligent gaze he would never have permitted himself to express. A person, at a single, casual glance, could not help feeling that he was in the presence of a superior being. The mighty intelligence and the pure and well-tried soul, shone through Edgar's eyes, and wreathed that sad face into a beauty that partook more of the spiritual than of the real world. 
                  Having gazed for a moment at his wife, Edgar noiselessly drew a chair along until but a few paces separated him from her, when he seated himself and commenced, in a voice that betrayed the delicacy of his feelings and the misery of his soul: 
                  "Hannah, if I do not disturb you too much in your work, pray look up and hear me speak." 
                  "I think I can both work and listen to you," she said, without raising her head from the canvas. 
                  Edgar paused for a moment, then continued: 
                  "When some eighteen months since, we stood together before the altar, I publicly vowed, in the presence of your parents and friends, ever to shield and protect you-ever to love and honor you. From the time when our hands were joined together, that pledge has been held sacred by me. Not for a moment have I forgotten it-not for a moment shall I forget it. That love, dear Hannah, that has drawn me near to you, and which was, as long as it awakened a responsive feeling in your own breast, my balm of life, now teaches me, since you have ceased to love me, still how to be true to my vow. I will not weary you long," he added, seeing that she impatiently guided the needle through the canvas with irregular and hasty jerks, "no, I will not weary you long." He raised his pale face a little higher, and, after gazing on her cold, calm features for a moment, continued, more sadly: "Hannah, I will not ask in what I have offended; for my heart tells me that I am innocent. Nor will I ask you why you have turned against me-why you withhold your love from your husband; it is enough to know that you ceased to love me, and that you, perhaps, regret having married me. I should not now speak of this, had I had not seen for weeks, for months, that my Hannah looks unhappy, too, and that my presence throws a shadow over her whole existence. Had I been the only sufferer, I should have remained silent, and carried my grief to the tomb. But it is not so. Can I not see that my Hannah also suffers-mourns? And shall I now be selfish, when a single sacrifice on my part can once more return the rose to her cheeks and make her happy? No, Hannah, no. I have pondered long, and I have pondered well. The sacrifice is great; but what is too great to offer upon the shrine of love? You are young and beautiful. You have still a long future before you, athwart the sky of which I, like a dark cloud, seem suspended. Let me be removed; all will be clear; the sun will once more come forth in his pristine brightness, and send his beams upon your path. I shall leave you, Hannah, leave you, forever. You will forget me, and in the arms of another find that bliss I once fancied myself capable of awakening in your bosom. Yes, Hannah, I shall leave you, and you shall never again hear of Edgar Armhold. Why should I persist in forcing myself upon you, when the longer I stay the more dissatisfied you grow? Is it not better that only one of us should suffer? And have I not sworn to make any sacrifice for you?" 
                  A pause ensued. Edgar raised his eyes toward the window, through which the moon could be seen slowly sailing in the dark, dark ether. Hannah's head was still lowered over her bosom, and her fingers were still playing the needle through the perforated canvas. 
                  "Our Emil," he continued, and here a tear trickled down his cheeks, and his voice fell almost to a whisper, "our Emil, our dear boy-O, do not teach him, when he is grown to manhood, to blame the father he may never behold. Tell him that he has taken this step, in order to insure the happiness of his dear mother. Tell him-tell my dear boy-that wherever in the future I may find a home-I shall think of him and of his mother-and bless them." 
                  He stopped, turned his face, and wiped away a tear. 
                  "Yet one favor I would ask of you, my Hannah," he continued, after a short pause, "and it is simply one I have so often asked, but never has been granted. Refuse, as you value your own happiness and would shield me from further misery, to admit Mr. Broadwell into your confidence. He is a heartless man. Under the cloak of a priest he hides a tiger's heart. He has destroyed my happiness: be careful, dear Hannah, that he does not destroy yours. Will you promise me this? Will you promise me never more to see him?" 
                  Hannah did not deign to answer him- she continued to work even without raising her head. Edgar watched her for a moment, and a sad smile played around his thin lips. 
                  "You do not love me," he continued, "never have loved me." 
                  Just then he imagined he heard a sigh escape her lips. The drowning man catches at a straw-the man who loves sees heaven or hell in a single breath. Edgar construed that sigh in his favor. How willingly he persuaded himself into the belief that it was an indication that she had loved him-that she did love him still. 
                  He threw himself upon his knees, and raised his pale, but beautiful face, caught her hand between his own, and exclaimed: "Tell me, O, tell me, Hannah, that you have always loved me-that you still love me-" 
                  He stopped short, and gazed intently at her stony features. 
                  What had she done? What had occurred to change his face, which, a moment since, was relighted with the bright glimmer of hope, into one full of anguish and disappointment? 
                  She had torn away the hand he had gently drawn into his own, as if an adder had stung it. 
                  "Excuse me, Hannah," he said, mournfully, and rose to his feet. "I am now fully convinced of what I always have suspected: you never loved me! Good-night, Hannah," and he slowly left her side and crossed the floor. When he had reached the door, he once more turned around and gazed upon the being whom pride suffered not to exhibit that she was in the least moved by the agony of her husband. 
                  "Good-night," he once more repeated. 
                  She did not answer him; she never raised her head. Her fingers were still plying the needle. 
                  His hand, which had been resting on the knob of the door, relinquished its hold and slowly slided down his side. He recrossed the floor; a moment later he again stood before her. 
                  "Hannah!" 
                  No answer-no sign of recognition-no change in her position. 
                  "Hannah!" 
                  Still no answer. 
                  He gently dropped upon his knees. 
                  "Good-night, Hannah," and he extended his hand to her. 
                  No answer. 
                  "Good-night, Hannah." 
                  Still she looked down upon her work, and plied the needle. Again his eyes rested upon her features. He drew nearer, and repeated, in a voice that betrayed, against his own will, the anguish of his soul: "Will you not bid good-night to your Edgar?" 
                  The same success, as heretofore, attended him. 
                  "Only say good-night to me, and I shall go away happy." 
                  Not a word escaped her lips. 
                  "Then you won't say 'good-night'-won't take my hand for the last time, though it would make me happy?" 
                  He waited nearly a minute, as if to give her time to reconsider her conduct; but had he spoken to a statue of marble, his appeal could not have been crowned with less success. 
                  He rose to his feet, crossed the floor and retired from the room. He sought his library and seated himself before his desk. The gas was not lit, but the moon was shining through the window and threw a pale, ghastly light over wall and furniture. A book was lying on the desk; it was his latest work-a work of which the whole press had taken notice, and which had stamped him one of the first authors of the continent. It had taught people to look upon him as a man of letters, whose great deserts could no longer be denied. It had had the power to silence calumny and the unjust criticism that had fallen from the pens of habitual meanness and envy. Now was the time in which he might have rested upon his laurels, and exclaimed: "I have soared above the common herd of men; I have acquired a name that will be handed down to posterity; I have reached the steeple of fame, the laurel wreath safely rests upon my brow, and thousands follow in my train to do me honor in my exalted position-I will be happy." But his heart had received a wound that was likely to prove fatal to his happiness. He had discovered that he was unbeloved even by his wife. 
                  What was his honor to him now? 
                  What was fame to him? What cared he now for either? How cheerfully would he have resigned his claim to both for the single phrase-the phrase he upon his knees had begged his wife to utter: "I love you!" 
                  How strange and incomprehensible is our nature! How few can read the mind and see the heart! Edgar Armhold! the man whose mighty intellect commanded the respect of thousands and thousands-the man upon whom women-women of worth and merit-smiled and who would have felt themselves happy if he had but deigned to smile back on them-the man who could have commanded the best of them-now sat there, alone in his library, in the darkness of night, a prey to the bitterest anguish that any mortal can feel. He loved with his whole heart and soul a being that did not respond to that feeling. He, the great and honored author, before whom all heads were lowered, and upon whom all eyes were turned-he had thrown himself upon his knees-he, the stately, dignified, undemonstrative student, had thrown himself upon his knees, had begged to be loved, and had been denied. He was a slave to that all-absorbing passion. How many times she had refused to answer him! He had thought she must be able to read his heart and brighten it with her love. But she had not read it-she had not understood the intensity of the student's passion, and therefore comprehended not the great agony of his soul. He had begged her to wish him a good night; he had only wanted to hear her voice-he had thought he must hear it, that she would speak to him-but when she had not even raised her eyes from her work; when she hadn't even done that much to please him, he had, as we have seen, risen from his knees, broken-hearted, unnerved, indifferent to every thing; and indifferent to honor, and ambition, had retired to his room. 
                  In the mean time Hannah had laid aside her work and gone down into the dining-hall. The servants could read in her face that she was not in the most pleasant humor possible; hence they retired into a corner while she took her seat at the table. It was the first time since her marriage that her husband had not joined her in her meals. This solitariness created a strange feeling in her bosom. The supper-bell had been rung; she had heard it, and she was certain that he had heard it also. A shade darkened her pale brow for a moment, as she murmured to herself, "Then this is the game he intends to play?" and a bitter smile hovered around her lips. She began to sip the coffee, but never before had it such a bitter taste to her. 
                  "Why haven't you rung the supper-bell?" she now exclaimed, ill-humoredly. 
                  "I have done so, ma'am," replied a girl, timidly advancing a step from the corner. 
                  "Ring it again-and you," addressing the balance of the servants, "can withdraw." 
                  The order was at once obeyed, and the servants withdrew. 
                  As Mr. Armhold did not make his appearance on the repeated ringing of the supper-bell, the servant, who was the favorite of her mistress, asked whether or not she should go up-stairs and see what kept her master from coming down. 
                  "Do as you please," she replied, as if she attached no importance to her husband's joining her at supper. 
                  Two or three minutes later the servant returned. Hannah, who had heard her enter, feigned not to be aware of it. 
                  "Mr. Armhold-" the girl stopped a minute, then proceeded in a very low voice; "I was up and asked Mr. Armhold to come down. He said he felt not like taking supper, and wished to be excused. I verily believe he has been weeping-" 
                  "Go away! How dare you say such a thing to me?" 
                  The servant lowered her head, and also left the room. Hannah then rose from her chair, and thoughtfully walked up and down the floor. She was far from being happy. She was displeased and dissatisfied with herself and with every body else. "He crying!" she muttered, a sneer writhing her lips. "Does he think I am so weak as to be moved by it? I shall soon show him that I am not to be caught in this way-that his threat to leave me-as if he could, dared do such a thing!-had not the least effect on me." 
                  So saying, she hastened into the lower hall, ran up a flight of stairs, and passed her husband's library, singing, in the highest key at her command, a lively air. 
                  When she had entered her own apartment she threw herself upon the sofa, and began to weep. It would be unjust to say that Edgar had become entirely indifferent to her. There was still concealed in the recess of her heart a spark of love for him who had once risked his life to save her own. Still that love was there-still it lived, though the force of prejudice and dissatisfaction had almost extinguished it. It was only after he had told her he would release and relieve her of his presence-that he would make her free again as the bird that soars through fields of ether; it was only then that that little spark, almost extinguished, began to revive and grow into a bright flame, and threatened to consume the elements that had usurped illegal power over her feelings. But still pride wouldn't suffer her to acknowledge it. When he had knelt before her, and had begged of her to say a simple "good-night," she could not have said it, had it cost her her life. She knew that he had not deserved that treatment at her hands; but she, as many others of her sex still do, had entertained the idea that to yield when wrong was to exhibit a weakness, while in this instance it would have exhibited the loftiness and greatness of her character. "I will show him that I have a mind of my own," she had said to herself, not dreaming that one can go too far, and, by the means employed, instead of furthering the end, entirely defeat it. 
                  "Ma'am," said her maid, entering her room before her tears were scarcely dried, "Mr. Broad well, the young minister, is down stairs in the reception-room." 
                  "I don't want to see him," she said, in a clear, loud voice; "no, I don't want to see Mr. Broad well," and she directed her eyes toward the door where the servant had stationed herself. Just then Edgar passed along the hall. Hannah saw him. 
                  "Tell Mr. Broadwell I shall be down in an instant," she cried after the maid, who had already turned around to deliver the first message. 
                  "Tell Mr. Broadwell I shall be down in an instant." Did she really desire at that moment to see the young minister? No. But had Edgar not heard her give the first order-namely, that she did not want to see him-and would he not be likely to judge that she had been frightened by his (Edgar's) threat of leaving? Yes; she would show him that she cared not for his threats: therefore that second order so loudly given. He had heard it. It had its effect. 
                  A moment later she regretted the step-but it was too late. The servant had delivered the message, and Edgar had left the hall and gone back to his library. 
                  From that time forth husband and wife scarcely ever met. Hannah persisted in keeping up a show of indifference, while Edgar, no longer desirous to obtrude himself upon her society, scarcely ever left his study, where he now devoted all his time to his literary labors. When accident brought this unhappy couple together, he would whisper her name, bow to her, and then pass on. In this manner six months passed away, Hannah, every day, growing, if possible, more distant and haughty, and Edgar, without a word of complaint, becoming more sand and broken-hearted. It was his custom to take each morning a long stroll in the garden, Hannah, unperceived from the window, watching his slender figure as it was seen, through the parted branches, slowly winding through the shaded paths. 
                  One morning Hannah, as usual, stood by the window, absent-mindedly gazing down upon the garden, when her eyes fell upon her husband, who had just issued from a thickly-foliaged arbor, his face pale, sad, and emaciated, raised toward the heaven which-ah! how unlike his bosom-was unsullied by a single cloud. Hannah watched him for a moment, and tears gathered in her eyes. She had not looked into his face for months, and was not aware of the change time and sorrow had wrought upon his features. Still he was beautiful, still his brow was calm, still a sweetness lingered on his lips; but a vail of sadness was hung over the black of his eyes, making them look like a sea of tears. 
                  "If he would but give way, I believe I should forgive him," she said, and, throwing herself upon her sofa, began to weep freely. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "Ma'am." 
                  "Take my child and dress it nicely. Do you hear me? I want to clothe my little Emil in his prettiest suit." 
                  Jane withdrew. The door being closed, Hannah began to weep once more. Soon, however, she dried her tears, and her face assumed again an aspect of calmness, almost bordering on severity. 
                  Jane returned with a laughing, handsome boy seated on her arm. 
                  "Will this do?" she said, approaching his mother, who pressed a fond kiss on the little one s ruddy lips. 
                  "Take him to his father now," she said. 
                  When Jane had reached the door, the voice of her mistress arrested her footsteps. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "Ma'am." 
                  "Don't tell him that I ordered you to take our little Emil to him. Do you hear me?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  The girl retired, and Hannah was once more alone. Strange were the thoughts that flitted across her mind. First this, and then that, came back to her memory; now she thought over her childhood and her first meeting with Edgar; then again she would think over what she had read in his private journal, and over the event in which the meek youth at once changed into a hero, risking his life to snatch her from the jaws of death, while not another had had the courage even to make an effort to approach the flames that had threatened to consume her. 
                  A servant entered with a card-it stemmed the tide of Hannah's thoughts, who, after looking upon it for a moment, said: 
                  "Tell him I shall be down presently." 
                  Hastily she arranged her toilet, and be took herself to the reception-room. Rev. Mr. Broad well was there. He rose as she entered, bowed, and, with a studied smile on his lips, saluted her. 
                  She did not take notice of it. Her husband's sad face still swam before her eyes. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," she commenced, in that peculiarly cold and metallic voice that impressed the listener with the firm nature of her character, "Mr. Broadwell, I feel it my duty to inform you that circumstances prevent me from further receiving the honor of your calls. I shall, therefore, be under many obligations to you if you respect my request, and from this day consider our acquaintance, of which my husband has never approved, and whose wishes should be mine, at an end. I hope you will perceive the propriety of yielding to my request." 
                  So saying, she turned her pale, severe face toward the door, for she heard footsteps in the hall. A moment later Edgar appeared, but no sooner had he beheld Mr. Broadwell, than he again retired, and slowly made his way back to his study. 
                  On the following morning Hannah was at her post again, looking down upon the garden, but the figure she was accustomed to see passing over the graveled path did not make its appearance. With a sigh falling from her lips, she left the window and slowly made her way into the hall and toward the room of her husband. She did not enter, though twice her hand was on the knob. Just then a few short broken coughs fell upon her ears. She turned away from the door with tears in her eyes. 
                  Morning after morning she watched at the window for the form she had been accustomed to see. But that form had deserted its accustomed paths; it was in vain she looked. 
                  Hannah became uneasy. Edgar must be sick, yet pride-PRIDE, the demon of the soul and destroyer of the better feelings-would not suffer her to look after her husband, or even to inquire of her servants what confined him to his room. 
                   
                  
                      
                        HANNAH WITH THE ARMHOLDS. 
                     
                   
                   
                   
                  Pride and stubbornness go hand in hand, and Hannah was no less stubborn than she was proud. 
                  One day Jane sought her presence and said that a physician had just left Mr. Armhold's room. This information was received without the slightest change in her expression, but no sooner had the servant withdrawn than she began to weep. 
                  She would have died sooner than have sacrificed her pride. She did not look after her husband, though weeks passed by and he was still confined to his room. Yet, when all was quiet about the house, and no one could be seen in the long hall, she would noiselessly steal toward his room, stop before the door, listen to his hacking cough, then return again to her own room, to weep bitter, burning tears. 
                  In the mean time Edgar had not been idle. Impressed with the idea that Hannah had lost all love and affection for him, and strengthened in this belief by her conduct ever since he had told her of his intention of relieving her of his presence, he had made arrangements to carry his resolve, as speedily as possible, into execution. He had deposited in banks large sums to the credit of his wife and child, sums the interest of which was sufficient to keep them in the finest style possible. Having done this, he had bought some valuable property and had signed it over to his wife. In this way he had distributed the main bulk of his fortune. He had, however, not forgotten the poor and needy. All had been remembered by him-even every servant in the house. 
                  His arrangements were completed, and he would now leave the home which, by his absence, he thought to make an abode of happiness for his wife. 
                  It was a cold, cold foggy Autumn morning. Jane entered the room of her mistress and whispered something into her ears, though she might have spoken aloud, as no one else was present. 
                  Hannah turned as pale a death, and for a moment her tongue refused to utter a word. She passed her hand over her brow as if to collect herself. 
                  "Jane," she said at last, "you say his trunks are packed?" 
                  "Yes, and I have heard him give the order to have them taken down to the mail-boat." 
                  Hannah rose to her feet and hastily paced up and down the floor. Seeing that her maid watched her, she dismissed her by pointing her index-finger toward the door. 
                  "I know he's only frightening me-wants me to give way-wants me to sue for pardon-but I shan't do it," said Hannah to herself, as soon as she was alone; "no, I shan't do it. He will not-dare not leave me." 
                  Just then Jane re-entered, and timidly approaching her mistress, said: 
                  "Mr. Armhold wishes to know whether you will suffer him to see you before he leaves this evening?" 
                  "No. Just tell him 'no,' a thousand times 'no.'" 
                  The servant slowly withdrew, hoping to be recalled; but she was disappointed. 
                  Edgar received the answer with composure. Only a faint, sad smile passed over his lips. He handed to her three or four papers that were nicely folded up, and begged her to deliver them to her mistress. 
                  Hannah, when alone, opened them. As she read them, tears came to her eyes. They contained a statement of the disposition he had made of his property. Still she doubted him-still she believed he would recant and not leave her. 
                  
                     Edgar Armhold did leave!
                   
                  Reader! You have, no doubt, discovered by this time that the lady we have introduced in the first chapter of this tale was no other than Hannah, and Edgar Armhold, the gentleman, who contrary to her expectation, had left his home, no longer to darken the future of his wife. Having now caught up with the first chapter of our story, and introduced to you some of the principal characters that are to play prominent parts hereafter the author, after this rather lengthy digressive introduction, still begs your indulgence, and hopes you will follow him with an attentive mind as he proceeds in this work of fiction. 
                
             
             
                
               PART SECOND. 
                
                  CHAPTER I. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              What a state is guilt, 
                              When every thing alarms it! Like a sentinel 
                              Who sleeps upon his watch, it wakes in dread, 
                              Even at a breath of wind. 
                           
                         
                        HAVARD'S "SCANDERBEG." 
                      
                   
                  THOSE of our readers who have followed us through the first part of this novel, may still remember that Reuben Armhold, on the night of his attack on the person of Mr. Montgomery, and after his accidental meeting with his twin brother Edgar, to whom he had been about to relate the dangers that for the moment had beset him, when the policeman's cry of "Stop him" abruptly put an end to the conversation-having felt that his pursuers momentarily gained upon him-without looking back, had recommenced his flight, and soon after had disappeared in a long, dark alley, which led into the most disreputable part of the city. 
                  Laboring under the impression that he had not only robbed, but also murdered his employer, he had good cause to dread the consequences which would follow his arrest. He therefore quickened his pace, if such a thing were possible at the speed he was already making, and in less than five minutes succeeded in running about half-way up a lane, where he had, owing to the darkness there, the advantage of casting hasty glances toward the street from which he had emerged, and toward the one which he was approaching, without the danger of being observed by any one who might be coming toward him from either extremity, and which extremities were lighted by dimly-burning lamps. 
                  No longer hearing the footsteps of his pursuers behind him, he halted for a moment, in order to take breath, when, to his great dismay, he discovered two policemen, the very persons who had been on his track before, cautiously entering the dark lane, one from each end, evidently for the purpose of cutting off his retreat; for they felt pretty confident that he had not yet had sufficient time, however swift-footed he might be, to pass through the lane. As he saw them-those terrible hirelings of the law-slowly approaching from the opposite crossings toward him as he saw them cautiously looking at every house, scrutinizing every nook and corner; a chill crept through his frame, and a wild fire gleamed in his dark eyes. 
                  "They are still after me!" he hurriedly whispered to himself, in an undertone, casting a hasty glance at the two extremities of the lane and at the two policemen, who were momentarily gaining on him. It had first been his intention, when he retreated into the lane, to pass through it, and seek refuge in a house on the square south of it, where, if he had reached it without being detected, he felt sure he would have found an asylum. Though frustrated in this plan, that house he was still determined to reach. Before him stood an old wooden fence some eight feet in hight: he would leap that fence, and endeavor to elude the vigilance of his pursuers by making his way, as fast as his feet could carry him, to the next street. After he had reached the top of the fence, he was espied by one of the policemen, who, by mere chance, had raised his head and looked toward the fence. He at once gave the alarm to his comrades on the beat, and then fired three rounds of his Colt's revolver, not one of which, owing to the darkness of the night and the haste with which the aim had been taken, grazed even so much as a hair of Reuben's head. 
                  These were the shots Edgar had heard; after which he had nervously buttoned up his thin, black coat, and, with his long, dark hair wildly flying in the air, had sped rapidly in the direction from which the loud reports had come. When he arrived in the dark lane, he was informed that the police were after a murderer, who had just leaped the fence (pointing toward the fence behind which Reuben had, by this time, made good his escape); who might have given himself up, however, they argued, as the pursuers were still on his track, and would, sooner or later, hem him in or run him down. 
                  This, in all probability, might have been the case, had Reuben not had considerably the start of his pursuers, and had he not been fleet-footed, and known every nook and conrer of the uninviting locality through which he was now fleeing for his very life. "They shan't catch me!" he again whispered, half aloud, feeling himself somewhat more secure as the distance between himself and his pursuers became every moment greater; when, just as he was about to turn into the street where he had hoped to find shelter, to his great consternation, a policeman, who as if by magic seemed to have risen from the ground, confronted him and endeavored to dispute his way. 
                  We have seen that when Reuben was still a boy, even then he was not to be bearded. He had never suffered any one to frown him down or humble him. He had never been a coward: he had always been brave and bold-a little too much so; he had been, on more than one occasion, even exceedingly reckless. 
                  Few men, however brave otherwise, would have had the daring to attack the representatives of the law-the upholders of order. 
                  The boldest sometimes cower before them, like children before their angry parents. We do not know whether it was a want, or an excess of courage in Reuben, which, at this very critical moment, caused him at once to ignore the officer in the man, and in the man to see only an enemy, whom he must at once overcome, or be overcome by him himself. He must have known and felt that with this dread man of the law no compromise could be effected. 
                  "Stop!" 
                  The only reply Reuben vouchsafed him was a kick in the abdomen and a blow in the face. The officer fell to the ground, and Reuben once more recommenced his flight. 
                  A few minutes more brought him alongside a red brick house, all the doors, gates, windows, and shutters of which were closed and barred, and not the least sound, had any one been disposed to listen for one, could have been heard within. One might have supposed that not a solitary living being was within its walls. 
                  Reuben knew better; it was not the first time he had been here. This unusual stillness was nothing new to him. There was a cause for this quiet, as well as for the closing of the windows and shutters, and for the locking of the doors and gates. 
                  Reuben did not knock at the front door, nor did he ring the bell; he simply leaped over the low iron gate, and hastened to the back part of the house. There he took breath for a moment; then, placing his mouth to the key-hole of a narrow door toward which he had glided, he whistled, scarcely audible, part of a soft melody. It had the effect of bringing a young lady to the door. She was about sixteen years old; small, very small, with scarcely the development of a woman, and a face that was very pale and thin. Between her partly opened lips glittered two rows of small, white teeth, which, however, exhibited around the gums unmistakable signs of decay. Her eyes were small and of a soft blue, and rolled restlessly in their sockets. At the time we introduce her to the reader, her long and beautiful yellow hair was carelessly falling over her white and rather emaciated shoulders, which, despite the bitter cold weather without, were in a state of entire nudity. 
                  Such was the little lady who answered the low whistle. "Is it you, Reub?" she whispered, as he entered the hall, closing the door behind her. 
                  "It is-it is, Sue!" he answered, hurriedly. "Let's go up stairs-come! Do you hear me, Sue? Come!" and he nervously took hold of her hand, and led the astonished girl toward a door at the further end of the house. 
                  "Reub, you are drunk! I won't go up stairs with you." 
                  "Sue! do you want to have me killed? Say, woman, do you want to have me killed?" he hissed, still dragging the trembling girl along with him. "The whole police force has been chasing me for over two hours; and I shouldn't be astonished if they were to track me to this damned place, and catch me yet!" 
                  By this time they had reached a flight of stairs. These youthful criminals-linked together by chance-at once ascended them, and a moment later they were safely locked up in a little room. 
                  "You frighten me, Reub," she exclaimed, as her restless eyes were riveted on his pale, excited face. "What have you done, that the police should be after you? God! how pale you do look! Here, take a little whisky;" and she ran to a closet and fetched a bottle, which she handed to Reuben, who hastily placed it to his lips, and, in one swallow, half emptied it of its contents; he then returned it to the girl, who was still looking upon the unusually nervous youth in unfeigned anxiety. 
                  "Now sit down, Reub, and tell your little Sue what in the world's the matter." 
                  Just then some unusual noise, heard from the street, attracted their attention. Reuben tore himself loose from the girl he had called "Sue," and who had had her white, thin arms twined around his neck, and ran toward the door. Opening it partly, he placed his ears in a position, where they would be most apt to catch any sounds arising on the street. 
                  "They have got me!" he exclaimed a moment later, as he recognized the voices of his pursuers, and he hastily locked the door inside. "They are in front of the house. They have hemmed me in after all-I wish I had a pistol with which I might blow out their brains-or mine." 
                  The last sentence was uttered with a bitter determination which more than any thing else betrayed the excited state of his mind. He now undoubtedly despaired of making his escape, and rather than be caught alive, would have preferred death by his own hands. "Sue!" he said, as he hurriedly abandoned his position at the door, and returned to the side of the trembling girl, who seemed rooted to the floor in the center of the room-"Sue! Have you any money? Don't say 'no,' if you do-why, why, curse me-I'll dash my brains against the wall!" 
                  The girl timidly raised her eyes to those of Reuben, which seemed to flash fire. She involuntarily drew back as she behold them, and lowered her colorless face. There was something in his looks that frightened her. 
                  "I have no money now," she replied, scarcely above a whisper; then, as if fearing the result of this information upon Reuben, who was still staring at her, she continued, "but the girls, perhaps, might loan me some. I have often loaned them money, when they needed it." 
                  By this time the noise, which Reuben had heard in the street, had subsided, and, feeling somewhat easier, he, in the same proportion, cooled down from the excitement under which he had labored. 
                  "Sue! I believe those men have gone away, after all. Go down-but make no noise-and see whether I am correct. If I am, come up and tell me so. I can't talk-don't know what I'm about-as long as I have to feel those cursed bloodhounds on my track." 
                  The girl did as she was bid, and Reuben, after watching her little figure steal through the door which she locked after her, threw himself upon a chair, and for the first time, since his attack on his employer, looked at himself, and while a cold shiver shook his frame, discovered that both his hands and garments were besmeared with blood. But before he had time to contemplate fully the effect of his this night's conduct, the girl returned, and stood once more by the side of the youth to whom she had given her all. 
                  "Reub, there are a couple of policemen down in the parlor-" Reuben didn't suffer her to complete her sentence. Turning, if possible, paler than ever, while his eyes, waxed still brighter, he sprang up from his seat and rushed toward the door, as if all the furies were behind him. Quickly he placed his hand on the knob, but turning round, he addressed the little woman with bare neck, bare arms, and unnaturally white face: 
                  "Sue!" he said, intently gazing at her. "Sue! I must have some money, and you must get it for me. There's no use of denying me. Those policemen down stairs are after me. I have robbed and killed my employer. This is the long and short of it. You can now do as you please: get me enough money to get away with-or-" and here his voice grew lower and a deep frown darkened his brow-"or you can have the pleasure of seeing me hanged on the gallows." 
                  The little woman began to tremble, and a tear stole to her eye. 
                  "How much do you need, Reub?" 
                  "Get me all you can. I must leave the country at once. It takes money to travel, and I haven't a cent." 
                  She noiselessly glided from the room and went down stairs. Fifteen minutes later she returned. 
                  "They won't let me have any money; there has been quite a 'fuss' in the house all day, and scarcely one girl is on speaking terms with another. I have tried to borrow of them all, but they have shown me the cold shoulder." 
                  Having delivered this-and in a manner that betrayed the anguish of her own soul-she paused for a moment. But Reuben might have seen, had he taken the least pains to study the expression of her features, that though she paused, she had by no means done speaking, and had something else on her mind to communicate. Drawing a little nearer she raised her thin face to that of Reuben, and continued in a low voice, as if afraid of its echo: 
                  "Those two policemen are still in the parlor-" A moment later, "and two of them are on the pavement in front of the house." 
                  Once more Reuben sprang from his seat-once more rushed toward the door, and once more his hand was on the knob. What prompted him to release his hold and drop his arm by his side? Why did he change his purpose? What kept him rooted to that spot, and made him defy his pursuers, who had evidently tracked him to this place of temporary refuge? 
                  It was simply that indifference-that recklessness with which a man, who has become tired of struggling with obstacles he imagines to have grown insurmountable, throws himself into the arms of fate. 
                  "Let them kill me! Who cares!" 
                  So saying, he once more turned around, and with a bitter smile curling his lips, slowly retraced his steps, and, instead of returning to his seat, moved to the other side of the room and flung himself upon a lounge that happened to be standing there. The little woman who had not for a single moment removed her eyes from the youth to whom she had sacrificed her all and for whom she had given up her home and future-that little woman with exposed arms, neck and breast-who displayed the nudity which modesty would have concealed from view, with a face as pale as death, slowly followed him, and threw herself upon her knees before him, and, while tears of anguish coursed down her thin, colorless cheeks, exhibited a tenderness the world-the callous, callous world-would scarcely have suspected could have arisen from the heart of a being whom a want of good training had consigned to misery, and which a no less want of feeling on the part of the world was keeping in the abyss into which she had fallen. 
                  "Reub!" she said, scarcely above a whisper, "don't give up-don't. O, rise-won't you? Come Reub! you have still time to get off." Seeing that his only reply was an ironical laugh, she fondly placed her bony arms around his neck, and, laying her cold cheek against his own, continued: "Will you suffer me to plead in vain? O, go, go, Reub. Just hide yourself somewhere during the night, and I promise you-I swear it, Reub-I will bring you money in the morning. I'll bring it to you, if I have to steal it. Now, rise and be off, else they will catch you-you know they will, if you stay here much longer, so go-do go." 
                  "O let me be! What care I if they do catch me?" 
                  Again the noise on the street attracted their attention, and even in the parlor below an unusual stir could be heard, which was by no means calculated to remove the too well-founded apprehension of Sue. "Do you hear them? Do you hear them?" she exclaimed, her whole face exhibiting the anxiety that filled her too-susceptible heart with fear. "Do you hear them? They will catch you if you stay-oh, go-for your sake, go. O God!-" 
                  With this last expression she bounded to her feet, threw a couple of shawls, that happened to lay on a stool close by her, over the lounge upon which Reuben lay, then hastened toward the door, for the noise that had attracted their attention at the start, had now fearfully increased, and seemed to, and, in fact, did emanate from the yard below. "They are after you!" she shrieked, directing her restless blue eyes toward the object of her fears and apprehensions, then, with a quick shake of her head, she threw back, over her naked shoulders, the long, loose hair that had become somewhat disordered and had fallen over her face, and began, as she approached the door, to chant, loudly and boldly, one of those want on melodies, which the inspired poet steals from the heaven of love for those who have fallen from that heaven into the abyss of shame and degradation. A moment later she disappeared, and as she hurried down the steps her voice rose to a higher key, her song became wilder, and more wanton, and rolled from her throat with a peculiar abandon, as if she were the happiest being alive, and had nothing whatever to trouble her mind withal. Soon, however, her voice was lost among others no less loud, which seemed to come from several gentlemen who were standing in the yard. Reuben, who had by this time thrown aside the two shawls under which he had been concealed, absent-mindedly listened to the stir below, which, however, soon subsided, when he, had he been so disposed and had left his hiding place and gone down stairs, might have seen his little Sue, the cold, cold wind blowing around her half nude form, steal from the parlor-door below-where a jolly, half-inebriated crew, comprising both males and females, sat around a table, laden with the choicest viands-and stealthily, with a small key in her trembling hand, slip, her small feet scarcely touching the cold brick-paved yard, toward a small door, behind which, after throwing hasty glances around her, she soon disappeared, a few minutes later to return again and run up a flight of stairs-but not until she had assured herself that no one had observed her-once more entering her own little room. 
                  I remarked, had Reuben been so inclined, he might have seen this-and more. He might have seen how she broke open the bureau of the woman with whom she boarded, and robbed it of thirty dollars. He might have seen with what joy and exultation she grasped this money, concealed it in her bosom, and exclaimed, while her blue eyes flashed fire: "I have saved him! I have saved him!" 
                  But Reuben lay there-upon the low, narrow lounge-his thoughts wildly and confusedly wandering without distinct or definite shape, caring little for what was done below by those who had come to arrest him, or by his Sue, who was determined to rescue him from their clutches. 
                  The door was unlocked, and the little woman entered the small room, relocked it again behind her, then hastened toward the lounge, upon which Reuben still lay with his eyes turned toward the ceiling, without showing the least concern about himself, or exhibiting a particle of curiosity as to any discoveries she might have made below. 
                  "Reub!" she said, with considerable uneasiness, at the same time taking hold of his hands, "I've got money-here, take it and go; for the policemen are searching every room below, and will soon come into mine, for they swore that they knew you were concealed in this house, and would not leave it before they had captured you. O, do get up and go, Reub!" she continued, in a tone that expressed the anguish of her soul, as he still lay there, staring at the ceiling, squandering the few moments that still remained to him for eluding the vigilance of his merciless pursuers, "Hear!" she continued, a moment later, "Do you hear that noise? Do you hear the slamming of the doors! O, Reuben! Reuben! say: do you want to drive me mad?" 
                  "O, let me alone, woman!" 
                  "Reuben! if you don't go this very moment, here may I die if I don't kill myself!" Then, her voice growing softer and more coaxing, she threw herself upon her knees, twined her arms around his neck, and whispered: "O, Reub, my love, do listen to your Susan, and fly; you have money now. They won't catch you if you hurry." 
                  Loud voices were now heard below. They drew Reuben's attention, and a smile of triumph curled his thin lips, and a glance, bright as a flash of lightning, shot from his black eyes. "No! They shall not catch me!" he exclaimed, leaping from the lounge, and pushing his slouched hat over his head; then, after snatching a kiss from the blue lips of the woman, who had now risen to her feet and was following her lover with her restless eyes, he rushed toward the door. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER II. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              ME miserable! which way shall I fly 
                              Infinite wrath and infinite despair? 
                              Which way I fly is hell; myself am hell! 
                              And in the lowest deep a lower deep, 
                              Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide, 
                              To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven. 
                           
                         
                        MILTON'S "PARADISE LOST." 
                      
                   
                  THE policemen, who had tracked Reuben Armhold to this house, were not satisfied with the protestation of the merry crew they had found in the parlor, that no stranger-a young man besmeared with blood-had just entered this abode, and at the present time was concealed somewhere within its walls. They, therefore, without losing any unnecessary time, had begun their search by examaning all the rooms in the lower story, but, having been unsuccessful in securing their game, had determined upon an investigation of the upper floor, and were just ascending the stairs for this purpose, when, as we have seen in the last chapter, Reuben had once more resolved on eluding their vigilance, and with this intention, neared the door that led to those very stairs and to the yard and street below. 
                  What was to be done in this awful dilemma? What course to be pursued that would prevent him from falling into his pursuers' hands? 
                  For a moment Reuben stood at the door as if rooted to the floor-his right hand firmly grasping the knob; his left nervously passing across his feverish brow. In the mean time his pursuers had made considerable progress, and had reached the uppermost step. There was no longer any time left for thinking! Action, action, speedy action, too, or all would be lost. With the brave, courage rises in proportion to the danger that faces them. Reuben dropped his hand from the knob as if it were a living coal, pulled his slouched hat still closer over his head, hissed, "curse 'em," through his grinding teeth, took three bounds across the room, opened the window in one second, and leaped through it in another. 
                  A smile of triumph curved Susan's lips, and a wild, piercing glance shot from her restless eyes. "He is saved! He is saved!" she whispered to herself, as she saw Reuben's figure disappear through the window, then she began loudly to sing another merry song, opened the door and nonchalantly passed through it, but was prevented from descending the stairs by several policemen, who now confronted and asked her to conduct them into her room, the door of which she had closed behind her. 
                  In order to give Reuben time to make good his escape, she thought it of the highest importance to keep his pursuers as long as possible about the house, from which vicinity she knew he was making all possible speed. 
                  "What do you want in my room?" she said to the foremost one, throwing a mischievous glance at him, and gently stroking his heard. "Do you know," she continued, after a short pause, "the parlor, and not my sleeping apartment, is the place in which I receive my visitors?" 
                  "O, girl!" the foremost replied, gruffly, "open the door and stop your nonsense. We're here on business, and not to hear your foolish talk!" He shoved the girl to one side while he placed his hand on the knob. 
                  "Don't break the lock, man!" she exclaimed, affecting to be angry. "Don't break the lock! If you insist upon getting into my room, why, I presume you will give me time to find the key, that I may open the door." 
                  "Then don't be so slow about it," replied the one who had first confronted her, and who seemed to be the leader of the whole posse.
                   
                  "I am not slow about it at all," she said, after she had taken out the key and stepped up to the door. "I should really like to know what you can want in my room." 
                  "We shall soon show you when we're once inside," said the foremost, impatiently, stamping his feet on the floor. 
                  "Yes, I'll bet my life on't, he is hid in there," added one of his followers. "That girl would have opened the door long ago had she not that fellew concealed in that room. Ain't it so, girl?" 
                  "Why, didn't I see him run this way?' commenced the third, who had been silent until now. "I tell you he is concealed in this house-most likely in the very room that girl is so slow about opening." 
                  "What are you talking about, man?" Susan remarked, coarsely laughing. "Yes, I keep a dozen of them hid constantly-no danger, though, that I shall ever hide such a fellow as you," and she laughed still louder. Just then she managed to drop the key on the floor, which accident was by no means calculated to increase the amiability of the foremost policeman standing by her side. 
                  "I believe you did that on purpose, girl," he said gruffly, stooping down and picking up the key himself. 
                  "I did not; but if I did? What business of yours would it be? I presume I have the right to refuse admittance into my room to whomsoever I choose." 
                  "You had better refuse to let us in," said the hindmost of the policemen with a low chuckle, while the door flew open, and their leader, followed by the whole posse, rushed into the room, throwing eager glances all about them. Susan kept standing on the threshold. 
                  "Where is he?" cried one, not seeing, as he expected, the object of their search. "Where is he, girl? Tell us, or we'll take you along." 
                  "I tell you, man," replied Susan, feigning to be ignorant of the cause of their presence, "I don't know whom you seek, and more than that-I don't care." 
                  "I want you to mind how you talk to an officer of the law," responded the disappointed policeman she had addressed. "We know what we're about. The man is hid somewhere in this house, and you don't need to look so innocent, for I'll bet my life on't that you, and nobody else but you, have hid him. So out with it; it will be better both for him and you. There's no use to play off with me in this manner. I'm too old for that." 
                  "I tell you, sir, for the thousandth time," she reiterated, advancing a few steps, "that I don't know whom you are looking for, and that no man is hid in this room." 
                  By this time the nooks and corners of the room, the bed, lounge, and even closet, had been pretty carefully searched, and, to the disappointment of the whole party, with very little success. Now the leader stepped up to Susan and once more interrogated her. She, however, remained as stubborn as at first, and, despite all threats and intimidations, denied having seen or hid any person. The officer scrutinized her features and sharply looked into her eyes, but couldn't detect any thing to lead him to the belief that she was deceiving him. 
                  "Then you say that you haven't concealed any body here?" he inquired, slowly moving toward the door. 
                  "I say so, and will swear to it, if you want me to do it," she replied. 
                  "Come, boys, let's look through the other rooms," he said; when another female came up stairs to see what kept the men there so long. 
                  "But there are no other rooms to look through," she said; "you have already searched through all the others;" and, not feeling very comfortable in the cold, she again retreated to the well-heated parlor below. 
                  "Let's go," said one who had, till now, taken very little interest in the proceedings. "There's no use to waste more time here. I said John was mistaken. The fellow passed by this house, but never entered it." 
                  "I tell you I'm not mistaken," replied the man he had called John. "I saw him come-mind me, I have sharp eyes-as far as the gate in front of the house. How he entered I don't know; but of one thing I am certain: beyond that gate he never went." 
                  Just then his eye fell upon the open window. A new idea struck him; the truth flashed upon his mind. For what purpose in the world could that window have been opened in such a season as this? Certainly not to admit fresh air. It must have been opened to let the fellow-who had been concealed in this room despite all the girl's protestations to the contrary-escape throught it, this being the only outlet that had been left to him. As this thought flashed across the policeman's mind, he pointed with his finger toward the window, while his eyes were riveted on the pale face of the girl, who had been uneasily watching him for some time. 
                  "Look here, woman!" he said, with a sternness under which the guilty girl quailed-"Look here, woman! what's this window open for? Raise your face, and tell me, what's this window open for?" 
                  She raised her face, but she couldn't stand the piercing glance of the policeman's eye. She lowered her head once more, and began to tremble from head to foot. A bitter smile of triumph for a moment lighted up the features of that terrible man of the law. He had not been mistaken: the fellow had sought refuge in this house! 
                  "Woman, you told us a lie!" he sneeringly hissed; "the fellow was concealed here, and made his escape through the window. Ha! you can't look up; you know that you have lied to us. But never mind: there s a way of punishing such as you." 
                  So saying, he advanced to the window. Now he was doubly sure that he had surmised correctly: the fellow did escape in this manner. Was there not a high brick fence there, that reached half-way up to the window, down upon which any boy could have leaped without the least danger? 
                  "Come here!" he exclaimed to the balance of his comrades; "come here, and judge for yourselves whether or not I was correct." 
                  Having satisfied themselves not only of the probability, but almost of the certainty, that in this manner the person whom they had tracked to this place had eluded their united vigilance, they withdrew from the window, and were not very choice in their oaths and epithets. 
                  "What shall we do with this woman?" said one of the party, taking hold of the girl, who by this time-her neck, arms, and breast still exposed to the cold-was half frozen. 
                  "Leave me alone!" she exclaimed, her eyes wildly rolling in their deeply-set sockets; and she tore herself from his rude grasp. 
                  "Let her alone for the present," interfered the leader. "She can't escape us. It will be time enough in the morning to see about her. Now, let us be off! That fellow must not escape us; we'll catch up to him yet. Mark my word, boys, he hasn't gone far. He is still in this neighborhood. 'Tis not the first thief and murderer who has concealed himself here. Woman!" and here he pointed his index-finger threateningly at Susan-"woman, look sharp if he should escape us!" 
                  So saying, they took their departure. 
                  For several moments Susan stood there, in the center of her little room, as motionless as if she had been a statue of marble. She did not mind the bitter cold wind that came hissing through the open door, toward which her eyes were still vaguely bent-that bitter cold wind that kissed, as with a breath of ice, her bare neck and arms. She had become used to this, and more. Though young in years, experience had made her old long before her time. The girl of sixteen-the girl despised by all, and degraded in the eyes of the world-the girl to whom all doors of redemption had been barred-that girl had feeling, sensitiveness. She had undergone privations-O, what privations!-the signs of which the hasty glance and superficial gaze of the multitude were not likely to detect in the painted face of the reckless and thoughtless being which she at times appeared to be. The policemen had gone away, 't was true; but were they not on the track of Reuben-her Reuben? O, how that thought dumbfounded her! Was he not her all-that Reuben? How often had she cursed herself for the love she bore him! Was he not, though, the cause of her fall-of her misery? The wretched, miserable tempter! And yet, when he had been by her side, and daringly confessed the wrong he had done unto her, she had looked into his pretty face, and, in the happiness of the moment, had closed her eyes to the future, caring not what would become of her when her beauty had faded-when he had become tired of her, and had sought out another whose charms were far more attractive than her own! 
                  We said, the policemen had gone away, and Susan, thinking of her Reuben, and magnifying in her mind the dangers that surrounded him, never in her life felt more wretched. "What if they should catch him?" she thought, as she still stood motionless in the little room, the cold wind hissing around her-"What if they should hang him?" then a moment later, in a low, low whisper, while she shivered and, so to say, shrunk into herself-"If they should hang him!" Her face was colorless; one, had he taken the pains to observe it, might have supposed it next to an impossibility for that face to become more colorless; but it gradually did, as her thin blue lips lisped: "What would become of me? What should I do in this world? To be hated and despised? Have the finger of disgrace constantly pointed at me? A tear started to her eye; but she must have felt it, for she raised and passed her bare arm over her face, then, with a shake of her head, that said as much as-"I don't care; let come what will-I know what I can do: I can kill myself-that's what I can do;" and heaving a heavy sigh, she slowly retraced her steps to the table, eagerly grasped the half-emptied bottle out of which she had suffered Reuben to drink, and raised it to her lips. 
                  Just as she was about to take the first draught, her attention was drawn to the slamming of a door below. The liquor still untasted, she placed the bottle on the table, and inclined her head forward, as if for the purpose of catching every sound that might be uttered below. Scarcely had two minutes passed before she heard again the slamming of the door, accompanied by the shrill voice of her mistress, exclaiming in a manner that showed that something "was up," that something wasn't all right. 
                  "Lucinda! Mary! Jane! Sarah!" 
                  Susan heard the parlor-door open, and the voice of several girls cry: "What's the matter? What's the matter?" 
                  "Who has been in my room?" the mistress of the house exclaimed, staring every one respectively in the face. "Who has been in my room?" 
                  "Not I, not I, not I," one girl after another answered, when the last one, Sarah, added, "I saw Susan come out of it a short time ago. Why, what's the matter?" 
                  The only reply was: 
                  "Go in the parlor-all of you! Do you hear?" 
                  Her words were law. The girls had nothing more to say; they went back into the parlor, while she ascended the stairs that led to Susan's room. 
                  Susan, with a palpitating heart, had heard this short colloquy. She could define pretty well the cause that had set her mistress into this fit of anger, and now that very mistress-whose temper she had good reason to fear-would have to be confronted in an instant. What should she do? Confess her crime and plead for a show of clemency? Or should she stoutly deny the theft (she felt confident the theft had been discovered,) and defy her accuser? But before she had time to make up her mind as to the best course to pursue under the circumstances, that dreaded woman, the mistress of the house, a perfect termagant, passed her threshold and strode up to where the girl tremblingly-for her courage had deserted her-awaited her doom. 
                  Susan shrunk within herself, and though she did not look up, could feel those angry eyes flash lightning down upon her. 
                  "Susan!" 
                  "Ma'am-" She raised her face; it was a tell-tale face. Every feature, every glance, every movement of her eyes proclaimed her the thief. She felt as if she would sink into the floor. A strange faintness came over her, and her very knees began to shake and knock against each other. 
                  "Susan!" and the woman forcibly turned the girl right about, rudely taking hold of her arm. "Susan, you stole my money!" 
                  That rough handling had the effect of raising the ebbing courage of Susan. Her small, restless eyes began to sparkle, and her thin, pale cheeks turned scarlet for a moment. 
                  "I didn't steal your money!" she said, defiantly looking her mistress in the face, at the same time tearing herself loose from her grasp. 
                  "Girl! you lie! You have stolen my money; didn't Sarah see you come out of my room? What business had you there, if it was not to steal my property? Give it up! Do you hear?" and she again grasped the girl by the arm. "Give it up, or I'll tear you to pieces. I'll do it-you know I'll do it!" 
                  "I haven't stolen your money!" 
                  "You haven't! Ain't you a nice one to say so? You haven't! You! you lying hussy!"-then, after a short pause, abruptly, "Give me my money!" 
                  "I tell you that I haven't your money!" 
                  The only reply the mistress vouchsafed the girl was a slap in the face, which brought the blood both from her mouth and nose. Susan became exasperated, and, as she saw the red blood trickle down upon the floor, it filled her heart with a feeling of resentment. Quick as thought she tore herself loose from the other's hold, and leaped, cat-like, her eyes wildly rolling in their sockets and her teeth closely set together, upon her antagonist, who, equally as lithe in frame, was, nevertheless, a head taller than her boarder, and therefore had the advantage of her. 
                  There is little romance in the description of a personal encounter between two individuals of the gentler sex, and in this age of super-refinement and gallantry, it would be worse than profanity for any author, especially if he be a young man and marriageable, and who has the least respect for his reputation as a gentleman, even to hint at the idea that our better halves, with silver voices and tender looks, will, at times, make use of their hands and fists for the purpose of engaging in a pugilistic exercise. We, however, shall risk our reputation and our chance for a suitable match, and not only hint, but positively assert, that these two females did fall upon each other with all the rage and fury their natures were capable of, and we only hope-'tis no more sincerely expressed than felt-that our fair and sensitive readers will safely overcome the shock their nerves may sustain by this information. 
                  After a brief game of fisticuffs-after an appliance of any amount of nails, on face, arm, and neck alike-after pulling each other's hair and scratching each other's cheeks, the two fell upon the floor, where-we regret to say it, for our sympathy is not with the mistress of the house-Susan got decidedly the worst of it. Her arms, face and neck were so badly scratched and besmeared with blood that Reuben, had he been there at that moment and seen her, would as soon, had they been of equal size, have taken one as the other for the girl who, though fallen from the path of virtue, had ever been true and faithful to him.
                   
                  "Will you give me the money?" 
                  "I haven't the money!" still persisted the bleeding girl. 
                  "You won't give me my money? you won't, won't?" and the feelingless woman knocked, with doubled-up fist, poor Susan's front teeth out. 
                  A shrill exclamation of pain escaped from the exhausted girl's bosom, and, without contending any further in this uneven struggle, she dropped her hands by her side, and suffered the other, without the least resistance, to batter her neck, face and breast; but seeing at last the helpless condition of the girl, she rose to her feet and said: 
                  "I told you that I would tear you to pieces, you thieving, ugly hussy!" After watching the bleeding form still lying on the floor for a minute with an ill-concealed gratification, she continued: "Now clear out o' here! Do you hear me? You shan't stay in this house another minute! Clear out o' here!" 
                  Susan rose to her feet-evidently for the purpose of obeying the command of the mistress of the house-and walked half-way across the room, when, by mere chance, she erected her head and beheld herself in the mirror hanging on the opposite wall. 
                  "Good God!" she exclaimed, covering her face with her hands, so she might not see again the horrible picture in the mirror, and commenced to weep. The tears were falling fast through her hands. She had not known to what extent she had been abused, but now, as she beheld, with an aching heart, the scratches on her face, neck, and arms, making her almost unrecognizable, she felt the great weight of the misfortune that had befallen her. She was still standing there, with her head buried in her hands, when the shrill angry voice of the mistress once more pronounced the terrible sentence-more terrible to Susan than a sentence of death-"Clear out o' here!" 
                  
                     Clear out! Clear out! Whither should the poor, abandoned girl go? Were not all the doors of society locked and barred against such as she, however penitent they might return and knock for admittance? Whither should she turn her steps now? What charms had she to recommend her to the homes of vice and immorality? She thought of her face, neck, and arms, and shuddered. They had been her capital, her wealth-her all; they had been the price of her living-and being gone, what else but starvation stared into her face! 
                  "I can't go away now," she pleaded, sobbing aloud, but the hard-hearted termagant felt no compunction, and, while a bitter smile of hatred curved her lips, replied: 
                  "You can't go away now? you can't?" and she turned toward the door, calling aloud: "Lucinda! O, Lucinda!"-Lucinda was the colored servant girl of the house-"come up here!" When the latter made her appearance, the mistress simply remarked: "Take that girl's carpet-bag and place it before the house-door!" Then once more addressing Susan, "Now clear out! Do you hear?" 
                  "O, Mary Ann"-that was the woman's name-"O, Mary Ann, let me stay; I can't go away in this plight;" and she fell upon her knees, sobbing aloud. 
                  "We'll see whether you can't," was the only reply of the mistress, and she took hold of the exhausted girl's arm, dragged her across the room, and shoved her through the door. 
                  Reader! pardon the author for drawing this picture. It is his duty to be true to life, and show it in all its phases. Let us not be over-sensitive and close our ears to facts. We err simply by ignorance; truth known, however unpleasant, and, at times revolting, can not but make us wiser. 
                  But what of Susan?

                              Which makes me any thing but what I am. 
                           
                         
                        JOANNA BAILLIE'S BASIL. 
                      
                   
                  STANDING in front of the red brick house into which we introduced the reader in the preceding chapter, might have been seen a girl in an attitude of thought and indecision. In her right hand she carried a large and pretty-well filled carpet-sack, and under her left arm a small box and a parasol of pink silk. She was attired in a costume better suited for the Summer season than for the inclement Fall weather to which she was exposed. Her shoes were light and more intended to trip the floor of a ball-room than to press against the frozen surface of the pavement. Her dress of pale-blue was thin, almost to transparency, and seemed to have suffered a fatal amputation at two very important places, exposing to public view not only the wearer's arms, but also her neck and shoulders. The wind was blowing keenly, and once or twice a chill crept through the girl's delicate frame. Having remained in an attitude of thought and indicision for several minutes, she at last raised her head, heaved, as she vaguely gazed down the dark street, a long-drawn sigh, and then slowly moved away. It might easily have been seen, had any one been there to watch her movements, that she was at a loss whither to go. For whenever she came to a crossing, she would halt and look up and down before she proceeded again upon her journey; and even then, after she had taken one or the other street and gone a little distance, she would, as if a new idea had entered her mind, turn back again and not unfrequently retraverse the path which she had passed a few minutes before. 
                  In the course of her walk she turned into a very dark and narrow, filthy street, on each side of which were old and dilapidated houses. Here all the doors and shutters were closed, and not a single ray of light pierced into the dark darkness of the dark night, in this silent and ominous street; not a voice was heard save, now and then, an uncouth laugh or a shriek, involuntarily reminding one of the owl; yet no one, seeing how, after the lapse of every few minutes, a door would noiselessly open either from one or the other house to admit or suffer females, dressed as for a carnival, to steal away, flying along the pavement like phantoms, would have come to the conclusion that the interior of these ominous houses partook inside of the deathlike, depressing stillness that reigned without. 
                  Before one of these houses the girl halted, placed her carpet-sack against the wall, and tapped gently at the front door. A moment later it was noiselessly opened, but scarcely far enough to admit so much as the stranger's feet. 
                  "Who are you? and what do you want?" asked a female, peering through the small aperture. 
                  The girl advanced a step, and raised her head; as she did so, the reflection of a light that was burning brightly in the room fell upon her face. The female who had addressed her from within did not wait for an answer. She had seen the girl's face-it was enough; the door was as noiselessly closed as it had been opened, and once more the wanderer stood in the darkness. 
                  For a moment she remained motionless with her head lowered toward the ground. A tear came to her eyes; but as no one saw it, she did not wipe it away. Again the carpet-sack was taken in her hand, and again she journeyed on. The cold wind still blew keenly, and had the effect of aggravating a hacking cough to which the unfortunate castaway had been subject for several months. Her lungs, by undue and frequent exposure, had become afflicted; she knew this and the fatal result that would eventually attend the disease, unless speedy cure should be effected; but she had never felt the least anxiety on account of it. Now, as she slowly moved along, the wind blowing into her face, she was frequently compelled to stop for a moment, in order so cough with more ease, as to walk while coughing was more than she could endure-almost deprived her of breath. 
                  At length she halted in front of a large brick dwelling. Twice she looked up, before she could command courage to ascend the few stiles that led to the door. She rung the bell, and, as she heard it tingling in the hall, a slight tremor shook her frame. She waited several moments before the call was answered. At last she heard footsteps, and her heart began to beat faster. The key was turned, and the door was opened by a colored woman, whose big eyes wandered up and down the frozen intruder. "What a face!" she muttered, derisively, and was about to close the door, when the girl, seeing and feeling the servant's intention, placed her hand on the knob, and said: 
                  "I want to see the mistress of the house; I wish to become a boarder." 
                  "I dare say you do; but we don't take boarders-at least none such as you." 
                  So saying, she made another effort to close the door; but the thinly-clad wanderer placed herself in the doorway, and hissed, her eyes wildly rolling in their sockets, "I want to see your mistress, not you!" 
                  The portly negress did not get excited in the least; on the contrary, the little display of spirit on the part of the girl pleased her. So she simply grinned and chuckled. The girl saw it, and felt like spitting venom in the woman's face. 
                  "Ain't you going to call your mistress?" and, as she put this question, she endeavored to push the colored woman aside, and make her way into the hall. But this was a thing much easier conceived than executed. She might as well have thought of moving the pillars upon which the house rested, as to move the woman who obstructed her path! 
                  "Let me pass," said the girl; and their shoulders came rudely together. This was a little more than the negress expected. So, while a malicious smile played over her dusky and unprepossessing features, she simply shoved the girl back over the sill and down the stiles, saying: 
                  "O, don't bother me! Go away from here!" 
                  The door was once more closed, and the girl was again on the tramp. The pent-up emotion got the better of her until now well-sustained equanimity. Her bosom began to heave, and tears rushed to her eyes and trickled down her cheeks. She wept for several minutes, during which time she passed through the street, and entered one of a less inviting aspect. Here she stopped, laid her carpet-sack before her feet, drew a handkerchief from her pocket and wiped her face. As she was about to return the handkerchief, her eyes beheld marks of blood upon it. For a moment she stood there, resembling a statue more than a living being-but only for a moment. For scarcely had she time to elevate the handkerchief again to her face, before she fell into tears and began to sob and cough, and cough and sob, as if the last moment of her life had arrived. 
                  But what misery can not a human being endure! However great the wretchedness of this poor girl, she was still endowed by nature with strength to brave the onslaughts of every wretchedness, and survive every pain. She wiped her eyes for the second time, and, as she did so, espied at a short distance from her a wooden gate, which stood wide open. Toward this gate she now made her way. Having arrived in front of it, she hastily dropped her baggage upon the pavement inside of the yard, then noiselessly stole to the back part of the house, placed herself before the hydrant, from the spout of which she caused the water to flow over her handkerchief, and began to wash her face, neck, breast and arms. Having no towel, she simply raised her white skirt and wiped herself dry with it; then once more stealing from the yard as stealthily as she had entered it, she again took up her carpet-sack, parasol, and box, and stepped into the street for the purpose of proceeding on her journey. As she raised her face, she exhibited the scarred but no longer bloody features of Susan, the girl we have seen ejected from the house in which she had boarded, and in which Reuben Armhold had sought safety. Now she struck up a brisker gait, for she felt unusually chilly, and thought by rapid exercise to counteract the benumbing effects of the chilly night air. 
                  No tears were now in her eyes; no shade of sadness hovered over her features. On the contrary, a bitter smile lingered in the curves of her lips, and a reckless glance shot from her eyes. Her thoughts had taken a different turn, and what first had made her wretched, now aroused all the stern defiance of her nature. For a moment she had forgotten Reuben-had grown selfish by thinking simply of her own forlorn condition; but now, the events that had transpired during the evening came back afresh to her memory. She imagined she saw her flying lover still pursued by the relentless officers of the law; she imagined she saw him slacken his pace, give way in exhaustion, and fall a prey to his pursuers; and with these terrible thoughts flitting across her mind, poor Susan had no longer time to think of her own misery. Now she knocked at every house she passed. "Can I have admittance? Will you take any boarders?" she would ask; but finding no one who liked her looks, she was turned away from every door, almost before she had time to make her desire known to the inmates. 
                  In this manner a full half-hour had passed, during which time her nose had turned red from the effects of the bitter wind. This circumstance, trifling as it appears, would scarcely be worth narrating, had it not become the cause of considerable merriment to those who beheld that change, and of the bitterest aggravation to Susan, who, at every door before which she successively presented herself, found herself an object of mirth. Of mirth! She an object of mirth! It was enough to madden her. 
                  She knocked again-it was at the door of a large building, in which every room was lighted up. A painted and powdered young lady, with false curls and saucy looks, answered the call. As she beheld Susan, she fell back a pace, burst into a rude laugh, and exclaimed: "What a nose! what a face!" Susan's eyes darted fire, and her still remaining teeth gnashed against each other, while she raised the parasol in her hand and broke it over the other's head. She did not remain to witness the consequences. Muttering an oath and a curse, she hastily hurried from the door. She had had some satisfaction; it pleased her, and a bitter smile curled her lips. Then she turned into another street, and then into a dark and dirty alley, on each side of which stood, at irregular distances, old, dingy-looking, and dilapidated frame cottages, whose doors, despite the cold weather, stood wide ajar, for the most part exposing to the passers-by crowds of grotesquely-dressed women, who were laughing, singing, chatting, cursing, and swearing; and men, judging by appearance, the dregs of society, who were howling, yelling, shrieking, and dancing. There was plenty of life on the street, too, and every thing appeared to wear an aspect of wild enjoyment. As Susan passed along, a tear stole from her eyes, but she wiped it off with her arm, and, with a smile on her face, entered one of the shanties. Men and women-the former smoking and the latter chewing tobacco-were promiscuously seated on chairs, beds, and floor. An old woman, without a tooth in her mouth and scarcely a hair on her head, dressed in a light pink gown and wearing red shoes, was seated by the hearth singing a vulgar song, which, just as Susan entered, called forth from the enraptured audience rounds of applause that might have been heard two squares. Susan waited until the noise of this outburst had subsided, then said: 
                  "Can I get boarding here?" 
                  "And lodging too!" burst out a savage-looking man, who appeared to be a deckhand on a canal-boat. 
                  "Can I get boarding here?" 
                  The old woman in pink dress and red shoes stopped singing, and for a moment set her sharp, gray eyes on the half-nude and freezing wanderer. 
                  "Have you baggage?" she said. 
                  "Some;" and Susan stepped boldly up to the old woman, and exhibited her carpet-sack. This simple act was satisfactory. 
                  "You may make yourself at home here," she said, and then, as if she had been interrupted too long already, proceeded with her song. Some of the inmates rose and began to dance a jig, while others clapped their hands and stamped their feet on the floor. Susan laid her baggage in a corner, and watched the motley crowd for a moment, then, in the midst of the excitement and confusion, made her way through the room back to the pavement. She returned at once, however, and taking a shawl from her carpet-sack, threw it over her shoulders, for she was shivering all over, and once more sought the street. As if acquainted with the locality, without pausing for a moment, she hurried down the alley until she halted in front of a small shop. It was a bar-room; a woman was attending to the customers. Into this place Susan stepped and asked for a glass of brandy, which was at once handed to her and emptied into one draught. At that moment a couple of policemen ran by. She dropped the glass upon the floor, and hastened to the door just in time to get a glance at them as they turned the corner. A boy who had also seen them, thinking something was "up," followed hastily in their wake. Susan, with a beating heart, asked him: 
                  "Have they caught him?" thinking of her Reuben. 
                  "And hanged him, too," was the reply of the booby, little dreaming the mischief his thoughtless answer was doing. 
                  
                     And hanged him? Susan had heard enough. She neither returned to the bar-room nor to her new home. No. She passed through this dark alley without once raising her head from the ground, turned into another street, until, after a walk of some ten minutes, she stopped before a drug-store and began to fumble in her pocket. "Not a copper," she muttered to herself, and fell into a sort of reverie, from which she soon, however, awoke, when opening the door and advancing to the counter, where an elderly gentleman was discussing, with a lad, the impropriety of swearing- 
                  "Please let me have a quarter's worth of morphine," said Susan. 
                  The druggist looked at her for a second, and withdrew for the purpose of getting the article called for. When it was handed to Susan, she felt in her pocket as if she intended to take out the money. 
                  "I must have dropped my pocket-book as I came along," she said at last, still fumbling in her pocket. "How bad! How bad! What shall I do?"-then raising her head, and looking with an embarrassed air in the druggist's eyes-"You couldn't suffer me to take this morphine along? could you? I shall surely pay you to-morrow." 
                  "We don't credit here," was the reply. 
                  "I don't desire any credit, sir," she continued. "I have lost my pocket-book; I'm certain I couldn't help that. Had I not a very sick sister at home, I shouldn't be so anxious to have the morphine now. But she is very sick, and I shall not be able to obtain more money before morning. Please let me have it? Won't you, dear sir?" 
                  "I am very sorry, indeed, very sorry," he replied, "but we-we don't credit. We have adopted this rule, and it will not do to deviate from it." 
                  So saying, he made a polite bow, and, carrying the morphine along with him, retired from behind the counter. Still Susan did not move. Her head was once more lowered toward the door, and she was thinking. 
                   
                  She knocked again on the counter. The druggist reappeared. 
                  "I must have this morphine; I can't leave without it," she said, determinedly, but scarcely above a whisper. "I have a pair of ear-rings-here they are," and she exhibited them-"they are worth-I don't know how much. I will leave them with you until I come on the morrow to pay you. Will not this do?" 
                  The druggist, thus secured against loss, agreed to let her have the morphine, which she, as if it had been salvation both to her soul and body, eagerly snatched from the counter, and, while a smile lighted up her eyes, hastened with it from the store. 
                  What did she want with morphine? Let us not anticipate events. Bad news rides a fast nag. It will not be long before we know all. 
                  Reuben had safely reached the ground after his escape through the window, and made his way back to the business part of the city. Finding himself out of danger for the moment, he relaxed his pace and began to study what next to do. Just then his eyes fell upon his coat and hands, and again discovering the marks of blood, he turned somewhat paler and once more quickened his pace. At a short distance from the spot which he was now passing was a restaurant he had frequently visited. He would go there and ask for something to eat, that he might get an opportunity to wash off the stains from his hands and coat. When, some fifteen minutes later, he was again on the street, the casual observer, who had seen him an hour before, would scarcely have recognized him. The blood-stains had been washed away, his neckerchief was nicely and tastefully tied, his clothes sat well upon him, and his face, with the exception of his eyes, which were restlessly glaring up and down the street, was as calm, as if nothing had occurred to disturb his equanimity. 
                  "I am safe at last!" he said to himself, feeling a kind of satisfaction at having eluded the vigilance of the police. But he spoke too fast. These men of the law had not yet given up the chase; far from it: they were more determined than ever to catch him. He was not long in finding this out. Reuben had the eyes of a hawk, and could recognize persons at a great distance. He was just turning a corner at a brisk gait, when something ahead of him attracted his attention. He stopped, raised his head, and strained his eyes toward an object up the street. His lips trembled, his whole frame began to shake, and his face assumed the hue of bleached muslin. Then his whole appearance changed. He was suddenly transformed. The ghastly expression of fear vanished, and he was himself again-Reuben Armhold, daring and reckless. He compressed his lips and clenched his fists. Defiance was written in every lineament of his features. The object that had drawn his attention was a policeman. He recognized him in an instant. It was the very one he had encountered and knocked down as he was making his way out of the dark lane. That policeman would be sure to recognize him now. 
                  "I'll turn back," he said, and once more retraced his steps. But it was too late. If he did have the eyes of the hawk, the policeman's were no less sharp; for he also recognized his man, and at once gave three loud raps with his club on the pavement. It was a sign to his comrades on the beat that their assistance was wanted. Before Reuben had time to make the least progress in his flight, he discovered that he was almost hemmed in by policemen, who seemed to have risen from the ground, so quickly had they answered the call. He had also heard the three loud raps, and knew for what purpose they had been given. His first intention was to run to the corner from which he had just emerged, but as he bent his eyes in that direction, he discovered, to his great dismay, among the persons coming from that point, the identical posse which had been after him all the evening, having traced him to the red brick house, and now again to this place. For a moment he was more than confounded. His feelings bordered on despair. He knew not what to do-which way to turn. His eyes glistened like balls of fire, his forehead wrinkled, his pulse began to beat high, and his breast rose in the same proportion. Still he stood there as if rooted to the spot. Nearer and nearer drew his pursuers. One minute longer and he would be entirely hemmed in. But he was determined to prevent it; danger is fertile in resources. The house nearest him was occupied by milliners. The store was still open, and lighted by gas. He looked in, and discovered at the further end several female clerks seated around the stove. We know not what he would have done had the clerks inside been of the opposite sex; we only know that now he turned toward the door and entered the shop. A girl perceiving his entrance, quickly rose from her chair and advanced behind the counter. Reuben, however, paid no attention to this, but simply passed on to the rear of the store. The girls seated around the stove watched his approach. "Good evening," he said, then passing them, he took the key out of the back door, stepped into the yard, and locked the door behind him. All this was the work of a single moment. The girls had been so taken by surprise that they had not as much to say, "Who is he? I wonder what he is up to?" But he had no sooner locked the door behind him and turned the key than they leaped up and rushed toward the street, crying at the top of their voices: "Police! Police! Robber! Thief!" 
                  They might have saved themselves all this trouble. The pursuers had seen Reuben enter ter the store, and were just in the act of crossing the threshold as the girls, almost frightened out of their wits, called upon them. 
                  We will not follow Reuben in his flight through yards and over fences, through lanes and alleys: let it suffice the reader to know that he had once more eluded the vigilance of his pursuers, and something like a half-hour after the time he had entered the millinery establishment, he might have been seen to leave the office of the New York Central Railroad and make his way toward the depot. No sooner had he arrived at the latter place than he had himself conducted into the sleeping-car, and selecting an upper berth, threw himself upon it, without disrobing. Now, for the first time since his attack on Mr. Montgomery, he had time to think over the events of the evening; but he was in too excited a state of mind for such an occupation. His losses, his theft, his return to his mother's, his surprisal by Mr. Montgomery, his attack on the latter gentleman, and the supposed result, his subsequent flight, his meeting with his twin-brother Edgar, his attack on the policeman whom he had knocked down, his arrival at the red brick house, his leap through the window, his renewed flight, his audacious entrance in the milliner's shop, his climbing the fences and hastening through unknown yards, alleys, lanes and streets: all this at once crowded wildly upon his mind, but without reasonable form and system for reflection. His brains seemed to be on fire. All was confusion within. One idea crowded upon another, and the last was more terrible than the one preceding it. 
                  In this manner he passed nearly fifteen minutes, when he fell into a troubled sleep, from which he only awoke on the following morning, the sun being already several hours high, the iron horse rattling in his ears as it carried him away from Cincinnati and his home. 
                  We will not follow him, however, but return to Susan just as she was about to enter the door of the shanty in which she had deposited her bundle and where she had been accepted as a boarder. Without taking the least heed of the motley crowd still dancing, cursing, fiddling and swearing, she passed across the center of the room and asked the old beldame to show her to the chamber she was to occupy in the future. Just then one of the girls, with painted cheeks and eyebrows, and who was chewing tobacco, got through dancing a jig and cast her saucy eyes upon Susan's face. 
                  "Where did you leave your front teeth, girl?" she exclaimed, and broke out in a rude, uncouth laugh, which was followed by a roar from a rough-looking, stentorian-voiced butcher boy. "Where did you leave your front teeth? Did you have a fight? O, what a face! what a face!" 
                  Susan did not exhibit the least anger; she had scarcely heard the remark. 
                  "Will you show me my room?" she inquired of the beldame for the second time. 
                  The old woman turned around on her low stool and pointed to a narrow door in the wall. "That's your room," she said; then, rising to her feet, she gave a slap to a girl who had been making sport of her red shoes. In the mean time Susan gained her own room. A dim light was burning on the table, and a pitcher of water was placed upon a low wooden stand. She looked at it for a moment, and emptied some of the water into the glass, which she carried back to the table. Then she took from her pocket a small package-it was the morphine, every bit of which she emptied into the glass. "Reuben!" she said, hoarsely; and drained it to the last drop. 
                  When the morning sun rose in virgin splendor upon a new day, "shining for all"-sending its quiet, holy light upon the stone-front palace and the wooden shed-it looked through clouded, filmy windows, into the dirty little room where the wretched outcast had taken the fatal potion, and revealed- 
                  No matter! 
                  Let us draw the curtain over the ghastly spectacle! 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Had been o'erstrung by pangs intense: 
                              And each frail fiber of her brain 
                              (As bow-strings, when relaxed by rain, 
                              The erring arrow, launch aside) 
                              Send forth her thoughts all wild and wide. 
                           
                         
                        BYRON'S PVRISINA. 
                      
                   
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              This wretched brain gave way, 
                              And I became a wreck at random driven, 
                              Without one glimpse of reason or of heaven. 
                           
                         
                        MOORE'S LALLA ROOKH. 
                      
                   
                  SOME ten days after the transpiration of the events described in the last chapter, Reuben Armhold was seated at a small table in a narrow room on the second floor of a first-class hotel in the city of New York. His hand guided a pen rapidly over a sheet of paper. The matter which he indited must have been of a nature not requiring much thought and reflection, for he stopped not for a moment, either to peruse what he had written, or for the purpose of considering how to proceed further. It was only after he had completed the task and had cast aside the pen, that he hastily snatched the paper from the table and, throwing himself back upon his chair, began to look over its contents. 
                  The result of this hasty inspection must have been anything but satisfactory, for he could scarcely have read two or three lines, before an expression of impatience and disappointment shot over his face, which had grown somewhat paler since his departure from Cincinnati, and the letter was torn into pieces and strewn around his feet. Again he picked up the pen, and again it was flying over a sheet of paper, faster if possible, than it had previously done, inditing, without a moment's thought or reflection, the following lines: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 SHAKESPEARE HOTEL, Wednesday, October 17.
                               
                              EDGAR:-What shall I think of you? This is my second letter to you. The first one was written on the day of my arrival in this city. Why have you not answered it? Tell me, why? Is it because you are as angry at the transgressor as you are ashamed of his transgression, and therefore desire to have nothing more to do with him? If this be the case, Edgar, and I opine it is, let me assure you, it is not my intention to extenuate my crime for the purpose of gaining your better opinion. I simply wrote to you because I could trust no one else with this affair, and because you are my brother, of whom I have a right to ask information in regard to transpired events, which is of the greatest importance to me to know under the existing circumstances. You have with held from me that information, and here I sit full of doubt and apprehension, not knowing what to do, and with scarcely enough money in my pocket to pay lodging and boarding for another day. In this strait you have placed me. You don't care a snap of your finger what becomes of me. But let this pass. 
                              Does mother know of my crime and does she grieve over it? Has any reward been offered for my apprehension? Am I safe in New York, or shall I cross over to Canada? 
                              Answer me these questions without delay, and forward me some money; for whether I stay here or go elsewhere, money I must have. If I should receive no reply to this within the lapse of ten days, I shall arrive at the following conclusions: 
                              First: That father and mother know of the murder, and now disclaim me as their son. 
                              Second: That the police are still after me and that it is dangerous to pass under my own name. 
                              Third: That you don't feel inclined to assist me out of my troubles. 
                              Now do as you please-write or leave it alone. I shall manage to get along in some way for the next ten days. If, however, after the expiration of that time, I shall have received no answer from you, we shall cease to be brothers, and look upon each other, if we ever should meet again, as entire strangers. 
                              Address me under the direction, 
                              "R. A., Shakespeare Hotel, New York." 
                              P. S.-Tell mother to forgive her Reuben and to pray for him. God bless her! 
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  He raised his head, dropped the pen, folded up the note without casting another glance over it, and placed it in an envelope, upon which he wrote the following words: 
                  
                     MR. EDGAR ARMHOLD, New York City, N. Y.
                   
                  This being done, he rose from his seat, left his room, and proceeded to the nearest branch post-office. The wrongly directed letter was at once dropped in the box and Reuben Armhold, not knowing but what the address had been correctly penned upon the envelope, retraced his steps, little dreaming that his second epistle to his brother would fare no better than the first he had sent to him; namely, not reach him. Both were retained in the New York post-office. The first, because it had been stamped with a mutilated two-cent stamp, (which Reuben, in a hurry, and without noticing, had used instead of a three-cent Postal Stamp). The second, because it had the wrong direction-reading New York instead of Cincinnati. Reuben certainly didn't dream of such a thing-if he had, how different would have been his thoughts! How different his future! The simple act of using a wrong stamp-so trifling a thing-became the cause of changing the destiny not only of himself, but of the chief characters already introduced in the first volume of this novel. 
                  Yes. Reuben retraced his steps to the hotel. Having arrived there he loitered for a brief time in the hall and reading room, then repaired once more to his own apartment. Here he slipped a cigar from his pocket, lighted it, then took a seat by the window that overlooked William Street. He sat in this position for several minutes, watching with an abstracted air the smoke-cloudlets curling around his head. While thus occupied the door turned upon its hinges, and a servant entered. Reuben did not hear him, however; he was too deeply engrossed with his own thoughts, until the servant had crossed the room and a moment later stood in front of him. 
                  "The clerk wishes to see you at the desk." 
                  "Tell him I shall be down instantly." 
                  The servant retired. No sooner was the door closed behind him, than Reuben rose from his seat, advanced two steps, then stopping, vaguely looked at the white-washed wall, and breathed a long sigh. "What can he want of me?" he thought, and his lips and cheeks blanched. "Can it be possible that I have been discovered? Can they have traced me to this place?" He lowered his head and fell into a short reverie. "I have paid him all I owed the house up to this morning," he continued a moment later, by no means feeling more easy in his mind after this conclusion. Again he paced up and down the room, and again he halted, but this time in front of the door. "I'll see what he can want with me," he whispered, and, shaking his black curls over his pale, thoughtful brow, he left the room. 
                  "You have sent for me, sir," he said to the clerk, after he had arrived in the office and placed himself before the counter. 
                  "Yes, sir," replied the other, advancing a step. "Looking over the register, I discover that you have neglected to write down your name. The proprietors have also noticed it, and requested me to inform you thereof, so that you might comply with our rule. Please, sir," and he placed the register before Reuben, "write down your name alongside of 44." 
                  Shakespeare makes his Duke of Glostersay, "The thief doth fear each bush an officer," and in this instance the phrase was verified. Reuben trembled, and his cheeks, which had assumed their ordinary color, again turned white. "Can they have tracked me to this place? and is this soft-spoken clerk simply playing a part to obtain my name, in order to confirm some foul suspicion?" 
                  While thus thinking, he mechanically raised his head and looked at the clerk, who was once more standing at the desk, having left the register, however, on the counter in front of him. Just then other parties stepped up, some to look over the book, and others to engage in conversation with the clerk. Reuben listened, but finding that the discussion was exclusively upon topics quite foreign to what could have raised the least suspicion in his mind, he waited for a fair opportunity to retire, which soon occurred by the disappearance of the clerk from behind the desk. 
                  An hour later Reuben could have been seen to enter a hotel in a different part of the city. He stepped up to the desk and asked whether he could obtain a comfortable room. Being answered in the affirmative, and called upon to register his name, he picked up the pen and wrote down the following: 
                  "Grim Castaway, Cincinnati, Ohio." 
                  The proprietor, a man considerably advanced in years, whose eyes had been bent upon the page, upon seeing that singular name, "Grim Castaway," raised his eyes, and rather more intently than politely gazed at the beautiful, pale youth who bore it. Such a name the landlord had never heard before, and it seemed to him, as he looked upon that face, with its strange, wild beauty, that he could see, in the lights and shadows of every lineament, the words "GRIM CASTAWAY." 
                  "Do you want to go up to your room now?" he inquired, turning the register around, and writing the number of the room opposite the address Reuben had marked down. 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "Porter, show this gentleman to number 26;" then turning to Reuben-whom we shall in the future know only by the voluntarily adopted name of "Grim Castaway"-said: "Will you have your baggage taken up stairs?" 
                  "I have none," was the short reply; and Reuben was about to follow the porter, when an idea crossed his mind, and he retraced his steps to the desk. 
                  "Shall I pay in advance, sir?" he inquired, looking the elderly gentleman steadily in the face. 
                  It had been the rule of the house that all strangers taking lodging, and having no baggage, had to pay in advance. From this rule neither proprietor or clerks ever had deviated. And even now the former was about to request a compliance with this rule, when he again gazed into that strangely interesting face, and thought of that no less repelling and repulsive name, "Grim Castaway," and for some reason, unknown to himself, answered: 
                  "No, sir, you need not pay in advance." 
                  Grim Castaway was then conducted to number 26. Having arrived there, and having told the porter that he might retire, at nothing else was required of him, he waited until the latter individual was out of sight when he threw himself upon a chair, in a meditative mood. Strange thoughts flitted through his mind at this moment. He seemed to live over the events that had become so eventful to him. But now he looked upon them-lived through them-coolly and dispassionately. His heart began to ague him, and his feelings were those of a person who had abstained from taking either food or drink for six and thirty hours. In this manner, with these unpleasant thoughts in his mind, and these gnawing sensations in his heart, he spent full two hours seated on the chair, not for once changing the position of his body or raising his head. Eventually a long-drawn sigh escaped his breast, which had the effect to arouse him from his absorption. He raised his face, and vaguely gazed through the window toward the gray clouds that flitted ominously across the blue heavens. 
                  "Mr. Castaway!" said a voice behind him. 
                  He shrunk into himself as he heard that name pronounced, but would not turn round so as to face the speaker, nor move his head so as to see who it was. And yet that voice was a familiar one-far from being unpleasant, as it was low, clear, and musical. Still, it had no effect to frighten him, and his heart began to throb under the influence which the mere mention of his assumed name exercised over him at this moment. 
                  "Mr. Castaway!" 
                  This time it was pronounced still lower, but with a sadness which could not fail to strike his mind with curiosity and enlist his better feelings. He was just about to turn his head, when he again heard the same sweet, but solemn voice utter: 
                  "I am also cast away." 
                   
                  Now he rose to his feet, and faced the strange visitor. 
                  "Good God!" he exclaimed, falling back apace; "I have seen that face before!" 
                  In front of him, in the opening of the door, stood a lady who, at the furthest, might have been five and twenty years of age. She was tall and slender, straight as a pine, and her face, which was dark, fixed and calm, borrowed an expression of intensity from a pair of large black eyes, which sat deep in their sockets, and gleamed like two balls of fire. Her lips were thin and ashen, and at this moment partly opened, just enough so to reveal a set of white teeth, which looked doubly white on account of the dusky appearance of her face, and the jetty black of her eyebrows and hair. She wore a gown of dark-brown woolen, which closely fitted her queen-like figure, and reached her neck, around which a little gold chain was suspended. No sooner had Grim Castaway risen from his seat, and uttered that exclamation of surprise, than she advanced a pace, and, after throwing a cautious glance toward the door through which she had entered, continued: 
                  "Your name is Castaway? Behold! I, too, am cast away." 
                  A frown-a frown terrible to behold-settled down upon her forehead, and her swarthy features became still more fixed and gloomy; but those eyes-those liquid balls of fire, which had looked immovable as stars-now rolled wildly in their sockets, losing every expression of intelligence they had possessed. 
                  "Yes, I, too, am cast away," she continued, her voice falling still lower, and becoming more impressive. "Forsaken by my father-foraken by my mother-forsaken by my husband-forsaken by the world-forsaken by Joseph Joseph!" 
                  She dropped her head, and her small hands played with the loose folds of her dress. She uttered some unintelligible words to herself, once or twice snapping her fingers together, creating a kind of hollow sound; then, raising her face, she stared wildly into Castaway's eyes, and laughed aloud. But it was a laugh that partook of the unearthly. It was the language of horror, set to a wild, witch-like music. A chill crept through Castaway's frame as he heard this horrid sound-as he gazed into her unnaturally calm face. Never before had he known fear. He could dare any thing human; but this woman was not human-could not be human. He fell back a pace, and placed his hand upon the back of a chair, as if this physical support could give spiritual power to the mind. The strange woman saw this backward movement, and must have read his thoughts correctly, for she said: 
                  "Fear not, Mr. Castaway; I am harmless, sir, though I am mad-though I am mad, sir!" 
                  There was something so tender and sorrowful in her expression, that Castaway felt almost ashamed of the feeling of fear he had permitted to take possession of his soul. His better nature once more predominating, he was about to advance in order to inquire the cause of his unhappy visitor's grief, when she once more raised her face and repeated: 
                  "I am mad-I am mad, sir!" 
                  A tear rolled down her cheerful. Her eyes were no longer wildly rolling in their sockets-were no longer glowing like two balls of fire. No; they had grown soft and dreamy, and an expression of sadness, like a veil, overcast them. Castaway gazed into their mellow depths, and again he thought he had seen them under other circumstances and at another place-those full black eyes, so sad, steady, and confiding. 
                  "Who are you, lady?" he said, advancing and softly taking her hand. 
                  "A cast-away," she whispered; and another tear trickled down her cheeks. Castaway's curiosity was now raised to the highest pitch, and, his sympathy being aroused, he was about to offer his services to the strange lady, whose evident misery had so powerfully appealed to his better nature, when he once more saw those eyes look so confidingly into his own, that he could not resist saying; 
                  "I do not know you, lady, but Grim Castaway"-and here a frown swept across his fair brow, and a bitter smile curled his thin lips-"shall, even at the risk of his life, lend a helping hand to a cast-away. So, fear not, lady, but tell me who you are, and what is your sorrow." 
                  A pause ensued. She pressed his hand, and raised her swarthy, but calm and beautiful face, but again their eyes met, and Castaway, as if a strange thought had flitted across his memory, dropped the hand he had held in his own, and falling back a pace, exclaimed, in a suppressed voice: 
                  "Ruth! As I live, it is the face of Ruth-of our little Ruth!" 
                  "Ruth!" exclaimed the other, her eyes again glistening and wildly rolling in their sockets, and she swooned upon the floor. 
                  At that moment a gentleman, with a stern mien, slowly and with a dignified air entered the room, and, looking frowningly upon our hero, said: 
                  "Your name, sir?" 
                  "Grim Castaway." 
                  "I shall see you by and by;" then, kneeling down, he assisted the strange lady, who had partly recovered from her swoon, to rise to her feet. 
                  "I shall see you by and by," he repeated; and, placing the strange lady's arm in his own, he led her from the room, muttering to himself, musingly, the singular name of "GRIM CASTAWAY!" 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER V. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Foul hypocrisy's so much the mode 
                              There's no knowing hearts from words to looks. 
                              Even ruffian cant, and undermining knaves 
                              Display a mimic openness of soul. 
                           
                         
                        W. SHIRLEY'S PARRICIDE. 
                      
                   
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Think'st thou there are no serpents in the world, 
                              But those who slide along the grassy sod, 
                              And sting the luckless foot that presses them? 
                              There are who in the path of social life 
                              Dobask their spotted skins in fortune's sun, 
                              And sting the soul. 
                           
                         
                        JOANNA BAILLIE'S DE MONTFORD. 
                      
                   
                  ON the subsequent evening, between the hours of eight and nine and just after the usual supper-time, the gentleman who had, on the previous evening, so unceremoniously introduced himself into Grim Castaway's room, might have been seen pacing-sometimes slowly and sometimes reapidly-up and down the reading-room, casting eager and uneasy glances toward the door whenever it turned upon its hinges to admit a new-comer. That he was anxiously awaiting the arrival of some one might have been easily seen, had any one of the many guests, who were seated and standing around the several tables, been in the least disposed to watch him; for he put no guard upon the expression of his face, and evidently cared little whether his anxiety was discovered or not. And yet no one who had the least claim as a judge of nature, would have pronounced the man, whose eyes were so searching and meaningful, and whose forehead was so broad, calm and thoughtful, of an unwary or indiscreet nature. Having walked up and down the whole length of the room for nearly half an hour, he was just about turning into the clerk's office for the purpose of retiring, when his attention was again drawn by the opening of the front door, and turning his eyes in that direction he discovered the arrival of a young gentleman, toward whom he at once advanced, and taking hold of his hand, simply remarked: 
                  "Where on earth have you staid so long, Clarence?" 
                  "It was impossible for me to come sooner," answered the other, exhibiting, as the light shone upon it, a very beautiful and intelligent face. "Shall we retire to your room?" he continued, a moment later. 
                  "As a matter of course." 
                  So saying, the two left the reading-room, passed through the clerk's office, asked for a few matches, turned into the hall, slowly ascended a flight of stairs, and, five minutes later, seated themselves at a writing-table in a small apartment, each lighting a cigar and placing it between his lips. 
                  "Well, Clarence," commenced the elderly gentleman whom we shall know in the future by the name of Thornton-Mr. Archibald Thornton-after he had watched the fume of his cigar for a moment or two. "Well, Clarence, what have you discovered?" 
                  "It is just as you said-this Grim Castaway is hard up for money. I followed him to a pawn office-" 
                  "Did he pawn anything?" interrupted Mr. Thornton, eagerly catching the other by the hand. 
                  "No." 
                  "No? What then?" 
                  "He went there for the purpose of selling-" 
                  "What?" 
                  "A watch." 
                  "Did he procure any money?" 
                  "Thirty dollars." 
                  "Thirty dollars!" repeated Mr. Archibald Thornton, thoughtfully, leaning back upon his chair, raising his eyes toward the ceiling, and once more watching in silence the smoke-cloudlets over his head. In the mean time the youth whom he had called Clarence and with whom he seemed to be on familiar terms, rose from his seat, and placed his chair nearer the fire that was brightly burning and playing havoc with the fresh fuel in the hearth. 
                  "Mr. Thornton, what do you think of this Grim Castaway? Strange name-Grim Castaway. I'll bet my life on't 'tis an assumed one." 
                  Mr. Thornton, still watching the fumes sailing over his head, simply listened to what Clarence said, but made no remark in return. 
                  "I have had several conversations with him during the day," continued the other, "and the only conclusion that I can arrive at is that he carries a weighty secret in his heart. More than that: It is my opinion that he is a felon-a being who is fleeing from the strong arm of justice." 
                  Here our youthful observer paused to re-light his cigar. Mr. Thornton now lowered his head and mechanically looked at him for a moment; then again turning his face in a different direction, he mused over what he had heard. Then both began to smoke in silence. Clarence was the first to speak. Crossing his limbs and placing his feet against the wall, he leaned comfortably back upon his chair and continued, in a tone which expressed, even more than his face, a want of feeling and a cold-heartedness, which seem to be to some gifts of nature, so early in life can they be traced in the human heart. 
                  "Mr. Thornton! Grim Castaway is a wicked fellow. Take my word for it-he is." 
                  "I presume so," was the simple reply. 
                  "That fellow has a bold eye, but that eye seems to labor under some restraint; I have watched it, and I am not mistaken in my opinion. Grim Castaway is a criminal. He is also reticent, while the cut of his lips would lead one to the supposition that he has not always been so. There is something behind the curtain, though he will not divulge it." 
                  Now Mr. Archibald Thornton, for the second time, turned his eyes rather upon the whole form than upon any individual part of Clarence, and laying his cigar aside, commenced coolly, deliberately, and in a manner that showed the great importance he attached to this subject: 
                  "Clarence, this strange being-this Mr. Grim Castaway must be removed from our path." Having delivered this, a short pause ensued. "I met Rachel in his room last evening-what might she not have revealed to him?" he continued, a moment later, thoughtfully looking into the fire. 
                  "How came she to pay that stranger a visit?" inquired Clarence, with an indifference that was truly remarkable in so young a person and in a being who was fully apprised of the danger to be apprehended to himself, as well as to Mr. Thornton, by any revelation Rachel (it was she who had sought the presence of Castaway on the preceding evening) might have made. "Did you not have her confined to her room?" he added. 
                  "I did, Clarence; but how she succeeded in forcing the lock, will, I presume, remain a mystery to me. When I, after an absence of several minutes, returned from the clerk's office to her room, I found it empty and herself lying at the feet of the man who calls himself 'Grim Castaway.' If she has revealed to him her secrets, what troubles may we not have to overcome?" So saying, he rose to his feet, and musingly walked up and down the floor, until a few minutes later he halted in front of his companion and continued: "Did you not tell me he had not yet paid his boarding, and that he had neither trunk nor carpet-sack with him?" 
                  "I have said all this." 
                  "Who knows but what he is fleeing from the arm of justice? I would give much to find it out;" and again Mr. Thornton, with his head lowered to the floor, began a slow, regular pace up and down the room. "Clarence!"-he halted as he reached the center-"Clarence! That man must be done away with-must be removed from our path; every moment of his life is dangerous to me." 
                  "Well? Shall I have his brains blown out?" 
                  Mr. Archibald Thornton started back. This question, so coolly propounded, took him by surprise. He riveted his eyes on the still indifferent-seeming youth, and mused upon the depravity of his nature. "Shall I have his brains blown out?" Was it possible to give expression to such a thought, and mean to carry it into execution, without exhibiting at least some concern? Certainly it was; for Clarence, in this particular, had come up to the very state of perfection. He had even not raised his eyes from the small smoke-cloudlets they had been watching for some time, to look toward the person he had addressed; for he entertained not the least idea that he had uttered a remark calculated to astonish the most unscrupulous villain-a villain even capable of committing so dastardly an act as he, himself, had propounded. 
                  "No," replied Mr. Thornton, "I do not deem it necessary to have his brains blown out, Clarence; there are other means-equally as effectual and less dangerous-to silence his tongue." 
                  "What do you mean? Would you have him poisoned?" 
                  "No, Clarence, no; you seem not to understand me. I don't want to deprive the man of his life-but of his liberty to do us mischief. Do you understand me now?" 
                  "Not quite, unless it be your intention to have him confined in a lunatic asylum along with Rachel; but I am of the opinion that it will take greater trouble to convince the world that he is a maniac than it took to prove Rachel's lunacy." 
                  "Rachel is a maniac," said Thornton, firmly, "and therefore goes to the lunatic asylum; Grim Castaway is a felon-if not, he will be one-and therefore goes to the penitentiary." 
                  This time Clarence turned his head in astonishment, and looked the other in the face. 
                  "And you want him confined in the penitentiary?" coolly observed the young man. 
                  "I think it the safest plan." 
                  "How on earth will you manage to get him there?" 
                  "He is hard up for money-" 
                  "Well?" 
                  "He shall be still harder up-" 
                  "Well?" 
                  "-and not being proof against temptation, he, like many others before him, will fall and-the sequel you know." 
                  So saying, he once more fell into a slow pace. A pause of several minutes ensued, which neither of the two seemed inclined to break. Clarence, however, was the first to speak. He slowly took the cigar from his lips, and after watching the fumes for a moment, raised his head, and said: 
                  "Mr. Thornton! if you deem it necessary to remove that man from our path, don't you think the sooner it is done the better?" 
                  "Clarence!" Mr. Archibald Thornton drew a chair near the other's, seated himself upon it, and continued: "Clarence, I think that young man will steal: perhaps not while he has the money he obtained by the sale of his watch; but he will steal. Necessity knows no law, and youth has no discretion. I want you to help him get rid of that money-do you hear me, Clarence? Find out his weak point-for who has not a weak point?-and then bear your strength upon it." 
                  "I have already found out one of his weak points," remarked the other, slowly puffing away at his cigar; "If he has others-and why shouldn't he have?-I don't know of them yet. The one of which I speak will do us, however." 
                  "To what point do you allude?" 
                  "He loves to play cards." 
                  Mr. Thornton did not reply. He simply raised his head and vaguely gazed at the opposite wall. His face was calm and his eyes were steady. He was evidently deliberating Castaway's ruin with that coolness so characteristic of the hardened and feelingless villain. 
                  "Clarence,"he said, after a short interval, "here is a pocket-book containing several hundred dollars. Take it, and when the fellow has lost all his money, it may not be a difficult task to tempt him." 
                  Just then a rap was heard at the door. Clarence rose from his chair, took the proffered pocket-book, and made his exit by a side door. Being gone, Mr. Thornton said: 
                  "Come in." 
                  And in came Grim Castaway, pale as usual, and with head as defiantly erect as ever. His black eves, too, were glistening, and his hair was rather loosely and carelessly tossed over his head. He had imbibed freely of liquor that evening, and Mr. Archibald Thornton was not long finding it out. 
                  "When you intruded in my room yesterday for the purpose of preventing the lady, over whom you seemed to claim an undue authority, from confiding in me her troubles," commenced Castaway, "you promised that you would see me by-and-by-but you have not done so: I came now to see you." 
                  Mr. Archibald Thornton listened calmly to these few remarks, and when Castaway had finished, rose to his feet, and with a bland smile upon his face, took him by the hand and led him to the seat Clarence had occupied, moving his chair by the side of it. "Mr. Castaway," he commenced, after both were seated, "I owe you an apology, and here I give it to you. It is true that I promised to see you by-and-by, and should've done so, had not the lady I found it my duty to remove from your presence last evening, occupied all my spare time since. Perhaps you are not aware"-and here he assumed a sadness that made his words more impressive-"that that lady is my wife, and unfortunately destined to spend her future in a lunatic asylum. It is a heavy blow on me, Mr. Castaway, to live and see so noble a woman's mind overturned, and that woman, too, the one I had with the grace of God selected to be my partner through life's journey." 
                  A pause of several minutes ensued, when he proceeded again: 
                  "I have no doubt she has been telling you something of her past life? Hasn't she, Mr. Castaway?" 
                  Had Archibald Thornton not asked this question in so evasive a manner, he would, in all probability, have been more successful in deceiving Grim Castaway. As it was, the latter was put on his guard, and as he riveted his eyes on the lowered face of the other, he came to the conclusion that there was some secret wrong intended against that mysterious lady by the cautious man at his side. 
                  "Yes, she has told me many of her sufferings," commenced Grim Castaway, "and I have promised to be her friend." 
                  An almost imperceptible frown swept across Mr. Thornton's brow as he heard this remark; but it soon passed off, and a smile struggled to his thinly-cut lips, as he said: 
                  "Mr. Castaway, believe me, no one can feel more grateful to you than that unhappy lady's husband, for the friendly offer you have made his wife. Yet I know her misfortune is such as God, and only God, can remove. Her malady, alas! is beyond human remedy. Have I not tried all that is in the power of man to try in order to restore her to health once more? I have, Mr. Castaway, traveled with her from land to land, sought all climates, visited all countries, given all legitimate recreations, without producing the slightest effect for the better upon her health. Her mind still wanders, her reason is still dethroned." 
                  So saying, he sadly shook his head, and for a moment placed his handkerchief before his face. 
                  "After an absence of something like two years," he proceeded, in a low voice, at the same time looking into the fire, "I returned with her again to our home in San Francisco. Of that home, Mr. Castaway, I made a little paradise. There I surrounded her with all the joys and pleasures which the mind could conceive and wealth bestow. But of what use were all my endeavors? Day after day she grew from bad to worse, until my friends-her friends-the physicians who had been attending her-saw the dire necessity of separating me from my dearly loved and greatly lamented wife. I wept and wept, Mr. Castaway, and implored them not to separate us; that I would cheerfully bear with her misfortune; that I would watch over her and protect her. But all was of no avail. My wife had become raving mad-at times it was dangerous to be by her side-and the physicians ordered her to be confined in the lunatic asylum. With what reluctance I yielded to the behest, God, our Heavenly Father, only knows!" 
                  Again he shook his head sadly, and a woebegone expression passed over his calm, thoughtful face. The tale of misery was so dolefully told, his voice was so mournful, that Grim Castaway wavered in the opinion he had already formed of Mr. Archibald Thornton, and was about to apologize and confess his suspicions, when once more his glance fell upon that man's face, and something, he could not tell what, seen in that face, strengthened the previously entertained opinion, and thus impressed, he looked long and searchingly at the other, and said: 
                   
                  "She has a child?" 
                  Stunned, as if a thunderbolt had struck him, Mr. Thornton's face turned the color of ashes. Grim Castaway was not slow to discover that he had touched a tender chord, and, encouraged by the first success, he kept his eyes riveted on his countenance, and, with more boldness, continued: 
                  "The name of that child is-" 
                  Just then Mr. Thornton raised himself partly from his chair, and suspense written in every line of his face, supported himself on the small table in front of him, and leaning forward, said, in a voice scarcely above a whisper: 
                  "What is that child's name?" 
                  "Ruth!" added Castaway, firmly. 
                  Thornton released his hold on the table, once more dropped into the chair, and lowered his head over his bosom. When he, some few minutes later, raised it again, his brow was as calm and his eyes as steady as if not the least struggle had taken place in his bosom. After a long pause, during which time his whole face assumed an expression of indescribable despondency, he nodded sadly, and said: 
                  "My dear Mr. Castaway! Can there be a more unhappy person on the face of the globe than I? My wife has no child-it is simply a creation of the mind overturned. She has hugged this phantom thought so long, until it has grown to her a truth-a reality. Imagine, if you can, dear sir, the agony of my soul, at being continually accused by her to every stranger she might perchance see, of having robbed and deprived her of her child! Has she told you any thing else?" 
                  We should never load those down with questions who doubt our own sincerity. It is calculated to raise suspicion in the least suspicious, and put those on guard who would, otherwise, have been the most unwary. It was so in this instance. Grim Castaway had had little faith in the honesty of Mr. Archibald Thornton's confession, and this question, so slyly put-"Has she told you anything else?" destroyed even that little. We are aware that the unfortunate woman had had no time to make any confession whatever to Castaway-that it was his own deduction that Ruth was her child, for she had never even told him any thing from which he might have arrived at this conclusion. But still he had arrived at it, and it was this that troubled Mr. Thornton, who, finding his question still unheeded, again repeated, and in a still more honied tone: 
                  "Has she told you any thing else?" 
                  "Yes," replied Castaway, in his natural impetuosity, "yes, she complained bitterly of your treatment, and I have sworn to hold you to account for it." 
                  A dark frown, reminding one of the thunder-storm threatening to uproot the earth with its still silent wrath, gathered upon his forehead, growing darker and darker, until his lips grew blue and began to quiver. 
                  "Mr. Grim Castaway," he commenced, riveting his sharp eyes on the face of his youthful antagonist, "Mr. Grim Castaway if you value your life, interfere not between Archibald Thornton and his wife." 
                  So saying, he rose to his feet, and began to pace hastily up and down the room. Castaway also arose from his chair, and proudly erecting his body until he looked a half head taller than he really was, crossed the floor, and defiantly faced the man who had dared to threaten him: 
                  "Do you take me for a coward?" he said, his black eyes glistening like two balls of fire; "do you take me for a coward?" 
                  "No," said the other, intently gazing upon the excited youth; "no, not for a coward, but for a felon!" 
                  Grim Castaway fell back a pace, and began to tremble. Archibald Thornton remained cool, and a wicked smile curved his lips as he said: 
                  "You see how advisable it is for us to remain friends. Let us, therefore, not quarrel with one another; and while I expect of you secresy, I shall promise not to hand you over to the police. Now let us separate for this evening, and to-morrow we shall be better prepared to discuss our interests more coolly. 
                  Grim Castaway felt crushed by the boldness of the accusation with which his own had been met. He knew not what to say or do. A guilty conscience made a coward of him. He was glad when he heard that they were to separate now, not to meet again before morning. He picked up his hat, and, without uttering a syllable, left the room. No sooner was he gone, than the side door opened and Clarence entered. 
                  "Have you listened?" inquired Thornton. 
                  "To every word," replied Clarence. 
                  "He knows more than he should." 
                  "He must pay dearly for it." 
                  "Then he must pay for it to-night, Clarence-to-night. So to your work at once, and ere I seek my pillow let me know the deed is done." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              What war so cruel, or what siege so sore, 
                              As that which strong temptation does apply 
                              Against the fort of reason evermore, 
                              To bring the soul into captivity? 
                           
                         
                        SPENSER'S FAIRY QUEEN. 
                      
                   
                  AFTER Grim Castaway had left the room of Mr. Archibald Thornton, he made his way neither up nor down the long narrow passage, which was lighted up at regular distances with gas, but, with once of his hands still on the knob, remained stationary at the door. It would scarcely be conveying correctly the state of his mind, by saying he was at that moment reflecting upon the conversation sation which had just transpired. I believe we would come nearer the truth in believing that his mind, owing to the stunning effect Thornton's bold accusation had had upon it, was in a state of dormancy, incapacitated to realize or to ponder over his present unpleasant situation. 
                  While thus with his hand upon the knob and his head lowered over his bosom, he still stood in the long, narrow passage and right before the door of Mr. Archibald Thornton's apartment, he imagined to hear not only another door, that could not have been far distant, softly turn upon its hinges, but also a moment later, the brief conversation between Clarence and Mr. Thornton which we have related toward the end of the preceding chapter. It was his first intention to rush into the room and boldly confront the conspirators who were plotting his destruction-perhaps devising plans even against his life. For a moment he shuddered, and while thus shuddering, his former courage and recklessness forsook him. The crime of which he supposed himself guilty (namely of the murder of Mr. Montgomery) had unstrung his nerves and literally made a coward of him. Now, while slightly erecting his head, he removed his hand from the knob, and slowly walked down the long passage until he arrived in front of his own room; when instead of entering it, which it must have been his intention to do, for he had turned his face toward it, he moved to the left and descended a flight of stairs which brought him to the bar of the hotel. He walked up to the counter, slightly moved his slouched hat back from his forehead, and called for a glass of whisky and a cigar. The whisky he drank and the cigar he lighted and placed between his lips. This done, he shoved his hat still further back from his forehead, then crossed the room, got himself a chair, and sat down upon it in front of the red-hot stove. For several minutes he smoked away at his cigar, absent-mindedly watching the gray fumes rising from it, or looking at the stove which seemed to be growing redder and hotter, in consequence of which he had to remove his chair; but before he once more took a seat upon it, recrossed the room and again presented himself at the counter. 
                  "Whisky," he said, leaning over on his left arm, and throwing his hat still further back upon his head. 
                  Whisky was handed to him, the glass was three-fourths filled, and, after being looked at for an instant, emptied it in one draught. He paid for it, smacked his lips together, re-lighted his cigar, and once more sought his chair by the stove. But he had scarcely taken his seat upon it before he arose and moved toward the extreme end of the room, for the stove had grown insufferably hot, and his head, under the influence of the liquor he had drank, had become somewhat feverish. There was a long bench, upon which a cushion of green baize was lying, running along the wall. Upon that bench he now carelessly threw himself, and while supporting his head upon his right hand, moved with his left his hat over his brow so as to conceal his face. He remained in this position for nearly fifteen minutes, when the sound of a voice roused him from his abstractedness and stayed his loosely straying thoughts. At the bar, in front of the counter, stood four fashionably attired young gentlemen. They were throwing dice for liquor. Alternately each took up the box and threw those ivory squares. 
                  "It's my throw now," cried one, giving the one next to him a pinch in his side, then turning the box bottom upward. 
                  "And a pretty throw it is," said another, laughing. "Nine; I can beat it, and but half try." 
                  It was the sound of that voice that had aroused Grim Castaway. And the sound of that voice came from the throat of Clarence. Castaway thought he could not be mistaken; it was the same he had heard in Mr. Archibald Thornton's room. 
                  "Have I not said that I can beat you all?" remarked Clarence, as he counted sixteen, then lifting up the dice and throwing them back into the box, raised his glass, and as he was about to empty it, appeared to notice for the first time Mr. Castaway, whose acquaintance he had made during the day. Removing his glass from his lips, the liquor still untouched, he nodded toward the suspicious youth, and while a bland smile passed over his face, called out, invitingly: 
                  "Will you not join us, Mr. Castaway?" 
                  "No!" 
                  "No?" continued the other, with a well-assumed jollity. "Come! let me not have to extend an invitation twice. I trust you will not refuse drinking the health of myself and friends." 
                  "I have drank twice," now remarked Grim Castaway. 'Tis as much as I can stand." 
                  "O, come along!" persisted Clarence in the same affable, lively manner. "I know you can stand another." 
                  Grim Castaway for a moment doubted his own senses. Was it possible that this young man, with so pleasant an address, so sweet a disposition, and so generous and lively a nature, could be the same he had heard ploting against his life? "No! that was an impossibility," thought the unsophisticated Castaway. The person who was a villain must look like a villain, but that young man had the appearance of innocence-of harmless innocence, and therefore he must be mistaken: it must have been some one else whom he had heard in conference with Mr. Archibald Thornton.
                   
                  "If you will not join us, Mr. Castaway," remarked Clarence, in a lowered voice "why -we shall be forced to drink without you." So saying, he slowly turned around and lifted his glass, but before he had time to raise it to his lips, Castaway was by his side, and firmly shaking his hand, shoved once more his hat back over his forehead, and said: 
                  "Excuse me, gentlemen, for my seeming rudeness-" then to the bar-keeper-"whisky-" "-the truth is, I am out of humor," he continued, releasing Clarence's hand; "but if you suffer me, to join your company I'll try to throw off my gloom and assume part of your liveliness. What say you, gentlemen? But before proceeding further, suffer me to introduce myself to you-my name is "Grim Castaway." 
                  It is not necessary to remark at length that these gentlemen were friends of Clarence, and were at present acting under his instructions. 
                  It took but a short time for Castaway to become acquainted with all of them. Unsuspecting as he was, he could not discover in their behavior any thing calculated to arouse the least suspicion of their wicked intent. Another glass was emptied, and another glass was emptied. It did not intoxicate Castaway; it simply raised his animal passion and made him somewhat reckless. It was just what Clarence had wanted, and while he looked upon Castaway's wildly flashing eyes and flushed cheeks, a wicked smile of triumph shot over his face. 
                  "A game of draw! what say you?" remarked Clarence, placing his arm in that of Grim Castaway. 
                  All, as a matter of course, were delighted with this proposition, and in less than five minutes' time they had purchased a deck of cards, and were directing their steps toward the hall, from which they ascended a short flight of stairs that brought them into the same passage Grim Castaway had passed through before he had descended to the bar, and where both his own and Mr. Archibald Thornton's rooms were situated. 
                  Now one of these young gents, whose name it is scarcely necessary to give here, as we shall in all probability not meet with him again in the course of this narration, introduced the rest of this lively set into a nicely furnished room, well lighted and heated. A table was stationed in the center and several chairs were carelessly standing about the room. These were at once taken possession of by our worthy friends, and in less than five minutes the game of draw was in full operation. 
                  The game of draw is very interesting, especially to young people. There is always something exciting in a game of hazard, but particularly so in this. Whether winner or loser, the player's mind is, so to say, continually on the stretch. One seems to live for the moment, in this occupation, forgetting every thing else around him. Grim Castaway was of a temperament to be easily carried away by such excitement and the wild pleasure that rose from it. In the present instance, being considerably under the influence of liquor, he appeared to a great extent to be swayed by passion solely. He saw nothing save his cards, and heard nothing but the bets. Capricious fortune did her best to enslave his reason. Once she smiled upon him and once she frowned upon him, and either change tended to one result-and the result was: to heat his blood more and more until it carried him entirely away with the excitement. Now his hair was loosely falling over his face, his cheeks were flushed, his eyes were restlessly rolling in their sockets and eagerly glaring upon the five cards-five painted pictures-he was nervously holding in his hands. He had played for something like an hour, and had won about three hundred dollars. Champagne was called for, and served up. Liberal to a fault, he paid for it, and the game went on as before, with the simple difference that the bets became larger and the players evidently more reckless. We say evidently, because only upon the casual observer it would have left that impression, while a shrewd eye could easily have detected that, with the exception of Grim Castaway, all were simply acting reckless and excited. At this stage of affairs fickle fortune turned capricious. Upon those she had frowned she now began to smile. Clarence, who had been under a streak of bad luck ever since he had taken his seat, retrieved his losses, and in a very short time was the winner of twice the amount Castaway had previously won, and the latter had now lost all his gains and was now owing to several of the young men, around the table, nearly two hundred dollars. It will not be necessary to describe the state of mind of our young and moneyless friend. We, who have followed up his history, have seen him under similar circumstances, and hence can make a pretty good conjecture. We shall, therefore, borrow a little of his impatience and proceed with our story, without making any further remarks upon it. 
                  Clarence now offered to treat them with some splendid Havana cigars, for which purpose he left his chair and withdrew, as he said, to his own room. The game went on as before, the absence of Clarence by no means changing the ill-luck of Castaway, who by this time had lost all control over himself. Something near thirty minutes had passed since the former had left the room. One of the young gentlemen now said, at the same time looking down upon the cards he was dealing: 
                  "If Clarence don't return soon, I'm going to quit and settle accounts." 
                  Castaway's hands began to tremble. What should he do? How could he settle? 
                  "Let's play a little while longer; he'll return by-and-by," he said. 
                   
                  "As you say;" and on went the game. 
                  Only those who have been in similar circumstances, who have been heavy losers at the game of hazard, know with what dread is awaited the last moment of the play. "A little longer!-a little longer!" is the cry, and like a death-knell falls the word "no!" upon the loser's ear. Again ten minutes had passed, and still no sign of Clarence. 
                  "Let's quit now," said one, looking on his time-piece. 
                  "'Tis immaterial to me," said another; "I'd just as leave quit now as later." 
                  "Once more around the table," exclaimed Grim Castaway, eagerly grasping and dealing the cards, "and if not here by that time, why-why, I'll go after him and fetch him." 
                  "I tell you what I believe-now that is between ourselves-" commenced one of the party who had until now scarcely opened his lips: "it is my opinion he'll not be back. He has won our cash, and don't feel inclined to lose it again." 
                  "If I could believe him guilty of such an act, I'd give him a good cowhiding," said the first, feigning to be angry. 
                  "I have seen him do a like trick before," said the second. 
                  "If this be the case, let's quit and settle all around," added the least communicative of the party, the very same individual who had raised this suspicion in regard to Clarence, and had put this ball in motion. 
                  "I am satisfied," said the second, throwing the deck of cards upon the table. 
                  "But I am not!" now added Grim Castaway. "He has won our money, and he must give us a chance to win some of it back, and not act the sneak." 
                  Our taciturn friend slowly picked from the table card after card, at the same time looking at them and saying, in a low, nonchalant tone: 
                  "Well, Mr. Castaway, if you can bring Clarence back, I shall be satisfied to play on; if not, I won't." He now shuffled the cards in a playful way, and began to whistle a low tune to himself. 
                  "What is the number of his room?" inquired Castaway, rising from his chair. 
                  "Number 37." 
                  "Gentlemen, wait a moment," he exclaimed, in an embarrassed tone, and hurried from the room. Five minutes later found him in number 37. It was a comfortably-furnished, dimly-lighted apartment, of twelve by twenty-five feet. A coal-fire was burning in a low grate, and yellow, ghastly flames struggled with the upward-curling smoke. The whole appearance of the room led to the belief that it had been lately occupied. Castaway looked about him, and, finding that the bird he was in search of had flown, rushed toward the opposite door in order to enter the adjoining room, which he found locked, however, from the outside. As he turned around to retrace his steps, a frown settled upon his forehead, and a sneer writhed the curves of his thinly-cut lips. He was undone-he felt that he was undone. How should he pay the money he had lost? He didn't reflect over it; how could he? It was his intention to go back to his creditors, and when there-when there-why, he would be there, and do something, he did not yet know what. He had already crossed half the room, when something attracted his attention and caused him to stop. On the left of him was a small table; on that table lay a pocket-book; it was lying open, exposing to view several one-hundred-dollar bills. What a temptation! How great his wants-how near his rescue! His heart began to throb fast. His hand was on the treasure; he raised it from the table, and, as he did so, he suffered his eyes hastily to wander over the room until their glance rested over the door, through which he, a minute before, had intended to seek the adjoining apartment. Over this door was an oblong window. Behind that window could be observed the shadow of two faces: those two faces Castaway recognized at once: they exhibited the features of Clarence and Archibald Thornton. The conversation he had listened to during the evening, in the latter's room, came afresh to his memory, and for a moment made him tremble. He dropped the pocket-book as if it were a live coal, then once more looked at the window, but the faces had disappeared from behind it. Now he clenched his fist and gnashed his teeth. The truth stared him in the face: it was as plain as daylight. This was the deed they had spoken of; this was the manner in which he was to be caught. Now he understood the trap that had been set for him. His vanity and self-pride were wounded; and the knowledge of the pit that had been dug for him aroused his wrath, and made his pulse beat high. He could have torn these scoundrels to pieces, if he had had hold of them but as this was not the case, his anger increased in proportion to his desire to wreak vengeance on them. His fists were clenched, and his teeth still gnashing, when his wildly-rolling eyes cast a glance upon the table. Paper, ink, and pen were upon it. A terrible laugh escaped his lips. He hastily picked up the pen, and, without a single moment's thought or reflection, wrote down the following: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "I hate you! You are a white-livered, black-hearted scoundrel! You'll steal if you do not resent this! 
                              
                                 GRIM CASTAWAY."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Then he dropped his pen, and, without looking down upon what he had written, rushed from the room. Five minutes later he was back in the bar. Clarence was there, smoking a cigar with an indifference and coolness truly astonishing. To Castaway it was more aggravating than astonishing. He sprang upon the conspirator like a leopard upon his prey. 
                  "If you take this, you are a puppy!" exclaimed Grim Castaway, and dealt Clarence a blow in the face that brought the blood both from mouth and nose. 
                  At this moment entered Mr. Archibald Thornton and an officer; the former pointed his finger toward Grim Castaway. 
                  "This is the wretch who would have dishonored my unhappy wife, had it not been for the timely interference of this youth," coolly remarked Mr. Thornton. 
                  "What!" shrieked Castaway, scarcely believing his senses. "What! I would have dishonored your wife? Liar!"-and he was about to rush upon Thornton, when the policeman placed himself between the two, saying: 
                  "Young man, you are my prisoner!" 
                  Grim Castaway simply laughed-but it was the laugh of the reckless and despairing, which fell from his lips and echoed through the room, while he suffered himself to be conducted to the lock-up.

                              Feebly and cold, the morning light 
                              Comes stealing round him, dim and late, 
                              As if it loathed the sight. 
                           
                         
                        WHITTIER'S POEMS. 
                      
                   
                  ON Wednesday, the 17th of October, Grim Castaway had, as the reader may still remember, addressed a second letter to Edgar Armhold. On Thursday, the 18th of October, the events related in the preceding chapter had taken place, namely: Grim Castaway had been marched off to the lock-up on the accusation of Mr. Archibald Thornton-an accusation which, if substantiated, was of a nature likely to entail upon the criminal a punishment from which the most hardened and reckless would have quailed. 
                  On the following Friday morning he had had a preliminary trial, which had resulted, owing to the testimony elicited on the occasion, in his being bound over, for the sum of two thousand dollars, to appear before the next criminal court, to answer-there the weighty charge brought against him; and having not been able to give the requisite security, he had been, as a matter of course, again remanded to jail. On the third of November the criminal court had been in session, had taken up his case, and-had sentenced him to five years' imprisonment in Sing Sing. 
                  The reader should not be surprised at this announcement. He must recollect that Mr. Archibald Thornton had determined upon Grim Castaway's confinement in the penitentiary. Had Grim Castaway picked up the pocket-book and retained it, he would have visited Sing Sing as a convicted thief. But as he had resisted the temptation-it matters little why-Mr. Thornton, ever fertile in expedients, had been compelled to resort to other means, and that at once, or else be too late, and, very likely would have found himself at the mercy of the very person he had intended to destroy. Hence, having seen his first plan fail, he had not waited until it was too late, but at once had gone for a policeman, and had Castaway taken to prison upon the charge of an attempt to violate the person of his wife-a lady who, owing to her weakness of body and infirmity of mind, was neither strong enough to resist, nor able to comprehend the gross outrage intended. On the day of trial, during which Castaway had maintained a dogged silence, Mr. Archibald Thornton had found no difficulty in substantiating his charge. Clarence's testimony would have been strong enough for all purposes, had not a half-dozen other witnesses corroborated his statement. 
                  Grim Castaway had heard the verdict with composure; in fact, during the whole trial he had exhibited an indifference which, to a great extent, deprived him of the sympathy of the impanneled jury, and left upon their minds an impression of his guiltiness, which even the skilled counsel, appointed by the Judge, had not been able to remove. 
                  
                     Five years to Sing Sing!
                   
                  On the evening of his conviction, Grim Castaway, his arms closely knit over his chest, his brow wrinkled, his lips firmly compressed, slowly paced up and down his lonely cell. On that same evening, some two hours later, Mr. Archibald Thornton and Clarence were seated in the same room into which the former had taken the latter on the occasion of devising means to destroy Grim Castaway. Mr. Thornton was seated by the table, holding a sheet of paper in his hand, from which he at times raised his eyes, directing them toward his companion, who was lazily reclining in an easy arm-chair, which was drawn up to the bright-burning fire. He was smoking a nicely flavored cigar, and watching, to keep himself from falling asleep, the fanciful curls of vapor rising from his lips and gradually disappearing above his head. 
                  "Clarence," began Mr. Thornton, laying down the paper he held in his hands, "are you asleep?" 
                  "No;" and the cigar was once more returned to his lips. 
                  "Why don't you answer me, then?" continued Thornton. 
                  "Why? Simply because I don't know what to answer." 
                  "Well, don't you want to read the letter for yourself?" 
                  "I have no particular desire to read it," replied Clarence, calmly, and still occupied with watching the smoke rising before his eyes. 
                   
                  "Will you hear me read it?" 
                  "Well, yes, if you wish it; but, in fact, I can not see, for the world, the interest either you or I can have in this communication now, since all is settled, and he is silenced for some time to come." 
                  So saying, he playfully removed the ashes, which had fallen from his cigar, from his pantaloons. 
                  "Listen!" 
                  Mr. Archibald Thornton moved his chair closer to the table, once more picked up the paper, and read the following in a low voice, putting great stress upon those passages the meaning of which he was desirous should not be lost on his indifferent-seeming coadjutor's mind. Whether or not Mr. Thornton was successful in this particular, is not of the least moment now. As we have said, he picked up the paper, which in fact was nothing but a letter he had, a few moments before, received from Grim Castaway, through the jail-keeper, and read it. 
                  The letter ran thus: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 "CITY PRISON, Friday, November 3.
                               
                              "Mr. Archibald Thornton: Through your villainy I have been sentenced to five years' confinement and servitude in the penitentiary of the State. Do you know what you have done? It means taking my life; it means taking the life of a young man who never harmed you to his knowledge. Mr. Archibald Thornton, listen to me! You are a scoundrel, a villain, and a murderer! Yes, I repeat it-a murderer; one who kills without shedding blood! Do you think that I shall ever forget it, or you, who have, for motives best known to yourself, brought this misfortune on me? No, Archibald Thornton! As there is a God in heaven, I swear to think over it, to brood over it-be it for years, be it through my whole life-until I shall meet you here on earth once more-or in hell, for ought I care-to bring you to account for this! Yes, Mr. Archibald Thornton! I am strong, healthy, and can endure much. I shall not die during these five years. The HOPE to be even with you, sooner or later, will strengthen and keep me up. No, I shall not die! I shall be the unrelenting evil spirit, the Nemesis of your life! Now I have something to live for: to wreak vengeance on the deepest-dyed villain that ever lived, who contaminates the very air he breathes! I wanted to violate the person of your wife! I!-I! Can you repeat this calumny? Can you read these lines and not blush for shame? O, you villain! I could tear you to pieces if I had you here! I!-I wanted to dishonor your wife? Ha! ha! ha! Who has ever-damn you! damn you! I say. I can not, can not remain cool! How shall I? Am I not sentenced to five years' hard labor? And for what? For no other crime than being suspected of knowing some of your wicked secrets. God! O God! who has ever heard of such a thing before? 
                              "What will become of mother-of father-of me? O God! O God! O God! 
                              "Archibald Thornton, I hate you! You can not imagine the depth of my hatred. O, may you live a thousand years, and each year bring ten thousand evils to your accursed soul and worthless carcass! Can I wish you any thing worse than all this? Yes-yes. My freedom-my FREEDOM! 
                              "Tremble, Archibald Thornton!-tremble-tremble! Your name, and that of Clarence, shall live in my memory until your blood-do you hear?-your blood has wiped it out! I a convict! It almost makes me mad to think of it! And to be locked up for five long years! What if my mother and father should die within that time, and I should never see them more? How could I live and know them dead before they had forgiven me? They have always been so good to me! I must see them again! 
                              "Mr. Thornton, have me liberated! I will forget what has passed between us, and forgive you. I can scarcely know the whole object you had in view when you brought this accusation against me; I do not want to know. Have me released, and I will swear to you never to mention your name, or any thing you may wish me to keep secret. I have an aged father at home, and a blind old mother. I am afraid I shall never see them again. They do not know what has become of their son. I have left them without notice, and a long absence will hasten their death. O, Mr. Thornton! let me go free-will you not? I am growing childish, you see. I am crying; I can not help it. I have been a bad boy at home: will you let me fall before my offended parents' feet and ask their forgiveness? Will you-will you? O, don't send me to Sing Sing! I want to become a better boy, and go home. Will you let me? 
                              
                                 GRIM CASTAWAY."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Mr. Archibald Thornton laid the letter back upon the table, and became thoughtful. After a pause of several minutes, he raised his head and directed his eyes toward the arm-chair upon which Clarence still reclined, smoking his cigar and still watching the gray smoke rising from it. 
                  "Have you heard the letter?" observed Mr. Thornton. 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "And what do you think of it?" 
                  "I think he might have saved himself the trouble of writing it-the fool! Why, if we had not wanted him in the penitentiary, we should not have made any efforts toward getting him there. I wonder whether he deems us weak enough to be frightened by the first part of his literature, or moved and softened by the second? for he has divided his epistle in two parts. I only fear he has been wasting his genius-throwing pearls before swine." 
                  So saying, Clarence got up, stepped nearer to the hearth, and after drawing his chair toward him, seated himself upon it, and, in a playful manner, began to throw some fresh fuel on the glowing coals. Mr. Thornton watched him a few minutes, and then said: 
                  "Clarence, you seem to make light of this letter." 
                  "No, not at all; it is a very nicely gotten-up letter." 
                  "But the threats it contains, Clarence?" 
                  "Are equally as harmless as bombastic." 
                  "Do you think so?" 
                  Clarence slowly laid aside the poker, with which he had been stirring up the embers, and turned his eyes toward Mr. Thornton, who thoughtfully met his young companion's glance. 
                  "Do I think so?" echoed back Clarence. "Do I think so?" he continued, addressing Mr. Thornton. "Why not? Why should those threats be otherwise than harmless? Have they not been uttered for the purpose of frightening us? Most certainly they have. But if not? Let us do him the justice to say that these threats came from his heart, and that he would actually carry them out if he could. But is he in a position likely to be able to harm either you or me? Is he not a convict? a convict not to be released for five long years? O, Mr. Archibald Thornton, I gave you credit for more nerve than you evince in this. Why fear this boy? He is not more than a mere boy, who can be moved easily and solely by passion-and is this Castaway not a very slave to impulse? O, I know him, and therefore laugh at his threats. Fear not, Mr. Thornton. For the present he is well taken care of, and it is a settled principle of mine, never to borrow troubles or anxieties from the future." 
                  "Ciarence, there is something in the nature of this Castaway which might well raise uneasiness, though the danger might not be nigh. Believe me, Clarence, though he is swayed by passion now, when servitude has worn out youth's enthusiasm, he will have but one thought-one idea-one aim in life." 
                  "And what will that be?" 
                  "Can you still be in doubt? Clarence I it will be revenge-revenge. Rest assured, Grim Castaway-or his looks belie him-throws out no threats he fears to execute. I, too, have studied his character, and have found its elements those of a man of a bold conception and an iron will. 'Tis true, he is harmless now-let him return, however, after an imprisonment of five years, after his senses have been dulled, after his hopes have been destroyed, after the enthusiasm of youth has dried up, after his heart has grown like a desert, and you will find in him-what he has truly styled himself-the 'Nemesis' of our existence. Not he, Clarence, is brave, who foolishly closes his eyes to danger, however great the distance that separates it from him. Blind daring is the inheritance of youth, caution is the acquirement of age and experience. Let us reflect, therefore, what disposition it would be best to make of this letter." 
                  "Mr. Thornton, you will excuse me for advancing an opinion." 
                  "What would you?" 
                  "Burn the letter and say no more about it-that's what I would do." 
                  Mr. Thornton rose from his chair, and slowly moved away from the table. In his hand he held the letter. He walked across the room and stopped before the hearth. "Here!" he said, and threw the paper in the fire. "Now, Clarence," he continued, "this being disposed of, let us turn our attention to something of more importance.-Will you go and see my wife?" 
                  "When?" 
                  "Now." 
                  "Yes." 
                  "I put all faith in you," said Thornton in a low voice. 
                  "To possess the confidence of Mr. Archibald Thornton is my chiefest boast," replied Clarence, smiling. 
                  "No compliments now," continued Thornton, "but go upon your mission. May success attend it!" 
                  Without saying another word, Clarence rose from his chair, and after lighting another cigar, left the room. He traveled the hall to a flight of stairs, which he ascended, then passed through another hall and ascended another flight of stairs, at the head of which he turned to the left, and walked through a narrow and dimly lighted passage, until he reached the further end of it. There he halted, took a key from his pocket, and unlocked a door. A moment later he stood in a narrow room, in the grate of which a poor fire struggled for existence. In front of that fire, on a low wooden stool, sat the strange lady we have met in Grim Castaway's room, and whom Mr. Archihald Thornton designated by the name of "wife." Her head was deeply buried in her arms, and her arms were resting on her knees. It was only after Clarence had locked the door and drawn a chair close to her side-after he had tapped her on the shoulder and addressed her, that she raised her head and gazed into his face. 
                  "You here?" she whispered, then once more buried her face in her hands. 
                  "Why? Is my presence disagreeable to you?" he said, coolly, dispassionately, looking mechanically at the dark clouds of smoke losing themselves in the darker space around him. "Don't you desire my presence?" 
                  Again she raised her face, and this time to rivet her black eyes upon the intruder. A frown knitted her brow, and a bitter smile curled her bluish lips. Nearly for five minutes she kept those wild, meaningful eyes riveted on him, and nearly for five minutes he bore-without the least change in his expression-their searching glance. Then she gave a wild toss to her head and withdrew her glance, muttering, as she did so: "Leave me! I can't bear the sight of you." 
                  "You are harsh, Mrs. Thornton," he replied, a faint smile playing on his lips. "I have come a messenger from your husband. Mr. Thornton means well with you, dear madam." 
                  "Well with me?" she repeated in a low, sepulchral voice, and tears gathered in her eyes. 
                  "Yes, madam, he means well, hence he much regrets that you should misconstrue his motives." 
                  A wild laugh escaped her thin lips, and her eyes flashed fire. 
                  "And then he regrets that I misconstrue his motives," she replied, her face growing darker and darker. "His motives! does he or you think that I can be deceived with your motives? Does he or you believe I am not aware of my destiny? O, you can not take me by surprise. I know you have not brought me here-though you did make me believe so when you took me from my home-for the purpose of returning unto me my long-lost daughter. You have brought me to this great city to kill me." The last few words were spoken in a hollow tone, hardly loud enough to be heard. She lowered her head and became silent. Clarence watched her for a moment before he replied. When he did reply, it was in a tone that, with its unstudied agreeableness, seemed to mock the harsh and bitter truths it breathed. 
                  "Mr. Thornton," he commenced, slowly, "brought you here for your own good and welfare. Your deplorable state of health, dear madam, needs more than the ordinary attention of ordinary physicians. I will not pain you now by referring to the necessity of removing you to an asylum where constant attention and skillful physicians may, in course of time accomplish a cure, and restore you unto us again strong in mind and body. No, madam, to refer to this malady I know must give you pain, I would therefore simply beg leave to prepare you for-" 
                  "For what?" 
                  As she said this she slowly raised her head, the deep crimson glow of the fire reflecting itself on her sad, thoughtful, swarthy face. Her full, large black eyes, so deeply set in their sockets, were steadily gazing at his own as if she preferred to read in them the balance of the message she had not given him time to express in words. But those eyes of his must have proved a sealed book to her, for she said: 
                  "Prepare me for what?" 
                  And he replied in his naturally sweet tone: 
                  "For a temporary home in the Lunatic Asylum, good Mrs. Thornton." 
                  The coals in the hearth were still red, and Mrs. Thornton's face was still seen by their light; but as she heard these words, the crimson hue-that deep glow-disappeared from her calm, thoughtful face and left upon it a whiteness, which, owing to its want of life, we generally couple with the thought of death. Her eyes were still riveted upon his own; but if she could not read anything in their depths, he had, at this moment, not the least advantage over her in this regard. Her eyes, though widely opened, were totally devoid of expression. They seemed firmly set in their sockets, incapable of the least expression. Soon, however, a change became visible in them. They had been hard-dry; now they gradually softened down and grew moist; in fact, the black seemed to melt away in itself and became liquid, until it disappeared under a layer of water which formed itself into glittering pearls, and which, first slowly, then faster and faster, one after another, sought the corners of her eyes, and trickled down her pale cheeks. 
                  "Weep not, good Mrs. Thornton," said Clarence, not above a whisper. "You shall be well taken care of, and, when again restored to health, be greeted by the smile of your daughter." 
                  Mrs. Thornton remained silent. She simply lifted her apron and buried her face in it. Clarence looked at her for a moment then relighted his cigar, slowly rose from his chair, said a "good-night," in a very low and deferential tone, and retired from the presence of the BROKEN-HEARTED. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Your narrow souls, 
                              If you have any, can not comprehend 
                              How insupportable the torments are, 
                              Which a free and noble soul, made captive, suffers. 
                           
                         
                        MASSINGER'S "MAID OF HONOR." 
                      
                   
                  SITUATED on elevated and uneven ground and presenting a picturesque appearance, on the east bank of the Hudson, some thirty-two miles from the city of New York, we find SING SING, a village of nearly three thousand inhabitants, and from whose several landings, steamboats and other vessels ply daily to New York, with which it has a large trade. It contains an iron foundery, shipyard, grist-mill, some small manufaturies, and several churches. Mt. Pleasant Academy, an incorporated institution for boys, is a handsome marble edifice, three stories high above the basement. The Mount Pleasant Female Seminary is also an incorporated institution, having a beautiful location. The Croton Aqueduct at this place is an object of much attraction; it crosses over the Sing Sing kiln by a handsome arch, of which the space between its abutments is eighty-eight feet, and is elevated from the creek one hundred feet. But Sing Sing is chiefly celebrated for its very extensive quarries of excellent cellent marble, large quantities of which are annually quarried and sent to New York and other places. These are chiefly worked by the convicts of the State Prison, located about half a mile south of the village, on grounds comprising one hundred and thirty acres. The main building is four hundred and eighty-four feet long, forty-four feet wide, five stories high, and contains one thousand cells. Adjoining it are the various workshops, chapel, hospital, store-house, etc., all built of rough dressed marble. 
                  At the time of our story there were something like nine hundred convicts, ninety of whom were females, confined in a separate building, at Sing Sing. It would undoubtedly be of considerable interest to the reflecting reader to have a condensed biography of each of the many prisoners, both male and female, working at the quarries, foundery, shops, etc.; but as the author has not made this his present task, he will simply select one of them, with whom the reader is already acquainted, and who is to play by no means an unimportant part in this story, and, as the phrase is used, "follow up" his fortune. 
                  It was a cold November evening. A thin drizzle had been falling during the day, but toward dusk the wind had changed more to the north-west, preventing a further fall of rain, and ushering in a fresh, nipping air, not unusual in that climate, at this season of the year. The convicts had all returned from their daily tasks and partaken of their evening repast, and were now resting their weary limbs in their respective cells. 
                  Let no one suppose for a moment that perpetual gloom hovers over these cells. The sunbeam pierces through the murkiest cloud. Man can and, as time flies on, does learn to bear the heaviest punishment with a steadily increasing indifference. What first seemed unbearable, loses by degrees its weight and sharpness, proving too weak to suppress the sunlight of the soul. Poverty loses its feeling of humiliation, sickness its pang, menial labor-the convict's labor-its degradation, the convict's chain, its weight and, at times, its meaning and disgrace. 
                  The prisoners, ranging in age from twenty years to three score and ten, were lazily lounging, some on the floor, others on straw mats or stools, relating to one another events in their past lives, anecdotes, tales, incidents that had transpired lately to one or the other, at the quarry, workshop, foundery or shipyard, etc., laughing at this, sneering at that, swearing about something else, cursing one, and praising another. Every subject had its advocate-was touched upon and discussed, and many sentiments were uttered by these rough-looking, unshaved, long-bearded men, that in wisdom would have done credit to a philosopher, in goodness to a philanthropist, in profundity to a scholar, and in candor and nobility to a MAN. 
                  Upon a mat that lay in a corner of one of those capacious apartments where, after working hours, the prisoners were allowed to congregate, sat three middle-aged men a little apart from the balance and keeping up an abrupt conversation in an under-tone. Now and then, one would look up and direct his eyes toward a young man who was seated at the large desk in the adjoining room, through the open door of which his graceful form could be distinctly seen by them. This young person had been the subject of conversation of these three men, who respectively bore the numbers of 432, 965, and 1849 (convicts leaving their names behind, being known to and distinguished from one another only by the numbers with which they are labeled on their arrival). 
                  "I never saw a stranger person than Silent 1880," said No. 432. 
                  "Silent 1880," was the young man seated at the desk, who had been surnamed 'Silent' owing to his persistent taciturnity, retirement, and want of sociability. During the five years of his confinement he had never joined his fellow convicts in their social games, had never been seen to smile or laugh, nor refer in the least to the crime for which he had been sentenced. No one knew what he had been, whence he had come, or the character of his crime. All that was known of him amounted to no more than that he had been brought here-a beardless youth-with some other convicts, on a cold autumn morning, to serve the State for the term of five years. For the first twelve months he had been a sort of overseer, but owing to his leniency, and want of harshness (which, however, had caused him to win the prisoners' good will-a rare thing) he had been removed from that position, and, as his scholarly attainments had been observed by the chief keeper of the penitentiary, had been appointed, instead, to the secretaryship which he still held at this time. 
                  "He is a grum sort of a fellow," replied No. 965, referring to Silent 1880. 
                  "I can't see any thing grum about him at all," said No. 1849. "'Tis true, he keeps principally to himself, and has little to say to any of us. But is he not just-aye, more than just-to all of us? Is he not giving us credit for every hour that we work over our time, so we may have some money when we enter the world again? I tell you, 965," he continued, significantly nodding his head, and playing with the long iron chain that stretched from head to wrist, leaving his arms sufficient room to play in, "I tell you what it is, this Silent 1880 you see now writing in yonder book is no bad man, though he is unpleasantly reticent and has something uninviting in his aspect. I have seen him stand between keeper and convict, and take the latter's part at the risk of offending the former. I have seen him do this and more, 965, and never as much as look around in order to receive the thanks of those he had served." 
                  "I have nothing to say against this at all," retorted 965, still not satisfied to give in, "no, nothing at all. Now this is my opinion, and I'm not often wrong, 1849-one convict is no better than another, and therefore Silet 1880 is nothing more than you or I, or any of us. Why should he hold his head so high, unless it be for the purpose of making a sensation among us, and of leaving the impression that he is somebody? Why, he passes us a dozen times a day without paying us as much attention as one would to a cabbage-head." 
                  "Ah, you have some prejudice against him, 965," added 1849. "Now, don't deny it-I know you. You wouldn't speak in this manner of me or of 432, would you now?" 
                  "I reckon I would if I had the like cause for it." 
                  Just then their conversation was interrupted by the appearance of the keeper, who simply passed through the lounging crowd, exchanging words, now with this and now with that one, scarcely stopping long enough with any one to hear the replies his remarks elicited. 
                  "I will bet he is more deferential to Silent 1880. He won't move away from him without listening to his remarks," muttered 965, with a sullen countenance. 
                  And in this particular, the convict, known by the number 965, was correct. The keeper had always paid a kind of respect to the young man whom he had raised to the position of secretary, he had never shown, in the same proportion, to any one else under his care. And it was this very difference thus shown to Silent 1880 that had caused him the enmity of several of the prisoners who, craving no show of respect for themselves, yet could not brook any one else to receive what they did not command for themselves. 
                  "Didn't I tell you so?" continued No. 965, contracting the deep lines of his forehead, as he beheld the keeper approach Silent 1880, taking a seat by the latter. "Didn't I tell you so? Look! If he ain't offering him a cigar! Him a cigar! Did you ever see the like? Him a cigar-Good! Good! Look! he won't accept of it-he won't accept of it. He has more self-respect than to take any thing of a keeper! I could almost like him for that. By George! he is a true fellow after all." 
                  "They are looking over the books together," said 432, as the keeper rose to his feet and approached the desk, glancing over the shoulders of Silent 1880 at the large folio Record into which the latter had been making several entries during the evening. "I doubt much," he continued, after a short pause, "I doubt much, whether, in case of Silent 1880 leaving us, another of all the convicts can be found, to fill the vacancy with the same skill and impartiality. For my part, I should feel grieved to see him leave us." 
                  "So should I," growled 965. 
                  "But not I," added 1849, still playing with those iron chains that had clogged his movements for eight long, long years. "He is still young and has a future before him. May it be a bright one! If he has erred, brother convicts, it is nothing more than the best of men have done before him, and still will do after him. That he is not a hardened villain, nor of a base nature, his very bearing, his looks indicate. Let us therefore be generous and wish him a happy future." 
                  He stopped and lowered his head over his half bare bosom. Many years had passed since he entered the penitentiary and many more would pass before he would go forth free again. A tear forced itself to his eyes, but he turned his head and wiped it off, with the loose, rough sleeves of his checkered shirt. 
                  The keeper passed by the trio, and entered his own office to the left of them. Under his arm he held the heavy record of the secretary, who was still sitting by the desk, his black eyes raised absent-mindedly toward the ceiling. 
                  "There must be something wrong about the books," said 965, who had seen the keeper pick the Record from the secretary's desk and take it to his own office. "I shouldn't be astonished if Silent 1880 had been caught in some rascality. Still waters run deep, as the saying goes." 
                  Just then some one entered the cell and made his way to the secretary's room. Having arrived there, he said, in a low tone, a few words to Silent 1880, and withdrew. Silent 1880 rose from his chair, and thoughtfully paced up and down the floor. There was a peculiar stateliness in his gait, and his graceful and dignified movements indicated that he, though confined with criminals and himself a convict, had mixed in better society and had known better days. He seemed to be between five-and-twenty and thirty years old, was tall and slenderly built, with a face in which every feature was enlivened by a peculiar expression of intelligence. His was no ordinary face. The large black eye, full of meaning, the thoughtful brow, the small Grecian nose, the thinly-cut lips, strangely sharp and calmly firm in the curves-the whole make-up of the pale face, shaded by a beard, and the long hair that loosely fell over his shoulders, fascinated while they repelled, and despised while they enlisted sympathy. Almost effiminate in beauty, there was something unyielding, determined in the expression of his features. His brow, his eyes, his nose, his lips-all seemed to partake of a firmness that belonged to a character not easily moved or shaken from a settled purpose. As he paced up and down the floor of his office, impeded in his movements by the iron chain, which, however, was lighter than those worn by the other convicts, his face was unusually pale. Once or twice he raised his hands to his brow, then suffered them again to fall by his side. In this manner a full half hour passed by. Then he turned around, left his office, closed the door behind him, and sought the keeper's room. 
                  "You desire to see me," he said, in a clear sonorous voice, to the keeper, whom he found engaged in looking over the book he had taken along with him. 
                  "I do. To-day is the second of November-to-morrow will be the third." He paused for a moment, looked at Silent 1880, whose colorless face and thoughtful brow was calm and unruffled, and continued: 
                  "To-morrow will be five years since you entered the penitentiary." Again he paused, and again he looked at that calm, stony face. 
                  "To-morrow the term of your imprisonment expires-to-morrow you are a free man once more." 
                  Still that colorless face betrayed no emotion. 
                  "You have faithfully served the State and me, and by your exemplary conduct have challenged my profoundest respect. You have, unlike the balance, and perhaps with less cause than they, refrained from denouncing any one; you have borne your trials like a man, and raised yourself above the convict. You go forth to-morrow once more to enter society-once more to meet your kindred. May you take along with you a chastened heart and an ambition to rise higher than this temporary degradation! Silent 1880 will be a man, and forgive and forget." 
                  He paused and looked upon the floor. When he, a few minutes later, raised his eyes, he found the face of Silent 1880 still calm, unruffled and stony. 
                  "Yes, he will forgive and forget-" 
                  As the keeper repeated this, the color of the convict's face changed-changed from a grayish white into a whitish green. He was evidently moved by these words. They had awakened some feeling that had lain dormant in his breast. His lips twitched nervously for a moment, and a slight shiver, as if occasioned by a chill, made his body tremble. Soon, however, he was again the same adamantine figure as at first. His lips were once more calm and compressed, and his face wore again that resolute, stony look, if any thing, more fixed and resolute than before. 
                  "During the term of your imprisonment," continued the keeper, abruptly leading his conversation into another channel, "you have earned by working over your time, and for which surplus labor you have not given yourself credit, nearly four hundred dollars. I shall hand you the money to-morrow. May it prove to you the means of leading an honest, honorable, and happy life." 
                  The keeper rose to his feet, approached Silent 1880, and took the shackles from his wrist and ankles. The heavy iron chains fell noisily to the floor. The keeper retired a step, but Silent 1880 did not move. He seemed rooted where he stood. A second later he began to tremble, and seemed to lose his foothold on the floor. He appeared to have grown weak and infirm by the removal of those iron fetters he had worn for five long years, and which, during that whole period, had never had the power to bend his form as they now bowed his spirit. 
                  The keeper said: 
                  "You must not let your courage sink in this manner. Let the past, with its sad recollections, be buried in oblivion. You have been indiscreet-perhaps more than indiscreet; I will not now determine; but you have also been punished for it, and with this your degradation ceases. So hold up your head, and enter the world a new man: with fresh hopes, ideas and aims. You have a fine education and an agreeable address. The road to fame and wealth is open to you. You have, no doubt, kindred who have mourned over your fall-let them now rejoice over your redemption." 
                  Here he interrupted himself. Silent 1880 had lost his equanimity-tears had come into his eyes-the first tears he had shed in five years-and trickled down his hard features, making them look like ice thawing under the influence of an early heat. 
                  "You are not bad at heart-no, not bad," continued the keeper, in a feeling tone, when Silent 1880, unable to hear any more, threw himself upon the generous man's bosom, quite unmanned, and sobbed aloud. 
                  Early on the following morning a solitary man might have been seen to leave Sing Sing and take a berth on a steamer that was advertised for New York. He seemed to know no one, and no one seemed to know him. His pale, calm face was beardless, and his hair was nicely trimmed. He wore a plain black suit, that fitted elegantly his slender form, which had in every movement an unstudied grace. On arriving on the boat, he paid for his passage, and retired to his room. 
                  "Buy books? Buy books?" cried a newsboy, passing along the state rooms. 
                  The stranger once more re-entered the cabin and approached the newsboy. 
                  "You want to buy a book? You want to buy a book?" said the latter, exhibiting his stock on the table. "Here are some of the latest novels," he continued. "'Our Mutual Friend,' 'Armadale,' 'Hereward, the Last of the English,' 'Sir Jasper's Tenant,' 'Land at Last,' 'David Chantrey,' 'Wives and Daughters.' You want any of them?" 
                  The stranger made a selection, and as he looked down upon the table his eyes became riveted upon the title-page of another book. 
                  "What is this?" he said, picking it up, with an eagerness that drew even the newsboy's attention. 
                  "O, this is the latest novel of all-has just appeared from the press. Great demand for it-have but one left. Every body wants to read 'THE DESERT OF THE HEART,' by Edgar Armhold." 
                  "How much?" said the stranger. 
                  "One dollar." 
                  "Here." The stranger picked up his purchases and hastily retired with them into his state-room. He closed the door, and threw all the books on the bed, with the exception of "THE DESERT OF THE HEART." This he retained in his hand; his eyes thoughtfully rested upon its title-page, as if something printed thereon had awakened a new train of ideas. A few seconds later he placed the book to the rest, whispering the name, "Edgar Armhold," and then looked through the small window of the back-door toward the cloudy sky overhead. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              If thou didst but consent 
                              To this most cruel act, do but dispair, 
                              And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread 
                              Thatover spider twisted from her womb 
                              Will serve to strangle thee; a rush will be a beam 
                              To hang thee on; or, wouldst thou drown thyself, 
                              Put but a little water in a spoon 
                              And it shall be as all the ocean, 
                              Enough to stiffen such a villain up. 
                           
                         
                        SHAKESPEARE'S "KING JOHN." 
                      
                   
                  THE stranger whom we have seen leave Sing Sing, on the morning of the third of November, arrived in the city of Cincinnati on the evening of the eighth-on the same evening that marked the departure of Mr. Edgar Armhold from his home and fireside. The stranger left the railroad station afoot and walked several squares, until he reached a crossing, where he entered a street-car that took him at once into the centre of the city. Having arrived at the corner of Fourth and Vine, he got out and made his way to Walnut-street, when he turned to the left and soon entered the Gibson House. He applied for a room, and being asked to register his name, he simply said that he would do so after he had washed his hands and changed his dress; then taking the key from the clerk he straightway retired to his room. Fifteen minutes later he was back again at the desk, leaving the key-but not his name. Whether it was through forgetfulness or otherwise that he did not comply with the clerk's request, we shall not investigate now; we only know that he left the hall without so much as looking at the register, and slowly made his way into the adjoining reading-room, picked up the city directory, looked through the A's, then closed it again, and, having laid it back upon the table, buttoned up his black cloth coat and left the hotel. Now he kept on Walnut-street, passed Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth, until he reached Ninth, when he turned to the left. It could be seen by his movements that he was no stranger in Cincinnati, though, at the hotel he had just left, among the many citizens whom he had seen there, none seemed to have recognized him. He passed through several other squares, and at last crossed the Canal on Vine-street. Here he struck up a quicker pace and hurriedly passed the many drinking-houses, in which the tape-measurer and the counter-hopper, inspired by beer and grown oracular in their own estimation, nightly labor to prove themselves asses by discussing subjects of art and science as much above their caliber as true modesty and dignity are above the comprehension of the shallow-pated and moneyed upstarts listening to them. He halted in front of a large storehouse and looked toward the window of the third story. Seeing that the room was lighted up, he entered the house by a side-passage and ran up two flights of stairs, which brought him to a low, narrow door. Here he knocked for admittance-his hand trembling like an aspen leaf. 
                  "Come in." 
                  In he went, and, as he beheld the inmates, he turned deadly pale. 
                  "Excuse me," he said, in a faltering voice, "but does not Mr. Armhold live here?" 
                  "What Mr. Armhold? The author?" asked a woman who sat on a low stool by the fire. 
                  "No; his father-Mr. Emil Armhold." 
                  "O, he has been dead going on five years." 
                  "Dead?" fell from the stranger's lips, and his face turned still paler, if such a thing was possible. 
                  "And where is his wife?" he asked in a low, hoarse tone. "Where is she?" 
                  "O, don't ask me about her-it always makes me cry when I think about that good, blind old lady's fate. No, don't ask me about her-please don't;" and the woman wiped a tear from her eye. 
                  "Tell me, I pray you-tell me what has become of her?" said the stranger, leaning forward, and trembling from head to foot. 
                  The woman turned her face toward the fire and covered it with her apron, after which she said, in broken words: 
                  "Poor blind soul! she fell down these stairs and broke her neck. I remember it as well as if it were to-day, how we carried her bleeding body into this very room." 
                  The stranger heard but the first part of this remark; he had fallen backward upon the floor and fainted. When he revived some minutes later, he turned his face downward and sobbed aloud. He plucked his hair from his head, and wildly tossed himself from one position to another. 
                  It was nearly twelve o'clock that night before he left that house, and slowly made his way back to the city. His gait was dignified and his step was firm; his head was held 
                      
                        EDGAR DISCOVERS THE LOSS OF HIS MONEY. 
                     
                     
                      proudly erect, and his face, so pale and thoughtful, had something exceedingly icy-austere in its expression. Who would have thought that that dignified gait-that firm, manly step, supported a form which, under its cold, seemingly-callous exterior, carried a heart-a wounded heart, ulcerated, bleeding, and suffering with the greatest anguish! And yet it was so, although the calm, inflexible, freezing look gave little indication of the inner struggle. The woman whom he had just left had told him so many things. She had told him that she had been a resident of the lower floor at the time of the terrible accident. She had known the old Armholds; had seen them daily. She knew a great deal of their lives-had heard much from Mrs. Armhold herself, but still more from the neighbors. All this and much more she had told him, he having taken an unusually great interest in all she had had to recite. 
                  He didn't return by the same route he had come-in fact, he didn't return at all. He simply recrossed the canal, then turned to the right, and made his way directly to Freeman-street. The clock struck one just as he stopped in front of one of the most fashionable houses of that aristocratic neighborhood. He passed through the gate and ascended the few marble stiles that led to the door, on a silver plate of which the name, "EDGAR ARMHOLD," was boldly engraved. With his eyes still resting on that plate, he rang the bell, rather forcibly for so late an hour. It was an excellent bell, and the echo of its sound tingled throughout the whole house. 
                  Hannah was still up, and sat by the window, with her eyes wide open, but scarcely awake. She had sat there ever since Edgar had left the house, laboring to convince herself that she had not acted wrongfully toward her husband, and that he would certainly return once more to his home and fireside. The letters which contained the statement of the disposition of his property were still in her hand, and now and then she would reread them one after another, and weep over them. It was just while she was thus engaged that the house-bell rung. At the first sound of it she raised her head in an attitude peculiarly expressive of anticipation. Her blue eyes began to glisten, and a faint but proud smile curled the curves of her sharp and thinly-cut lips. "I knew he would return," she whispered to herself, and threw the letters on the floor. 
                  At the same moment the door was gently opened, and Jane, her favorite maid, noiselessly, and but half attired, entered her room. Before she had time to address her mistress, the latter had risen to her feet and commenced: 
                  I know what you would, Jane. But you may retire to your bed again-you need not answer the bell. No!" Then to herself-"He had no business to go away in the manner he did-and thought he could frighten me by so doing. I knew he would return." 
                  Jane was about to retire again, when the bell for the second time rung through the hall. It must have been a strong pull that had been given the string, for the echo that followed it was unusually loud and, so to say, trembling in the air. Jane stopped, turned around, and inquiringly looked at her mistress. 
                  "And I shall not see who's at the door?" she ventured to say. 
                  "No, you shall not see," replied her mistress, haughtily, crossing the room and absent-mindedly looking through the window. "Let Mr. Armhold stay were he will tonight-with my consent you shall not open the door for him;" and she left the window once more and took up a position in front of the hearth, gazing into the fire. 
                  "Do you think 'tis my master," replied the servant, "who makes this great noise at so late an hour? I never shall believe it, ma'am, until I'm sure of it." 
                  "Who else could want to call at so unseasonable an hour, foolish girl? 'Tis Mr. Armhold, and no one else. But"-here she changed the tone of her voice, and fell to spacing every word-"but if you think otherwise-"why-go down and see for yourself." 
                  Jane who had thrown a heavy shawl over herself before she had left her own apartment to enter that of her mistress, now took that comfortable article of apparel and wound it still tighter around her form, so the want of the wrapper she had not taken time to put on, might not be noticed by the person, whoever he might be, she was about to confront at the door. 
                  "I'll go down-stairs and see, ma'am;" and Jane did go down-stairs and see. She opened the door a space, and through that space her eyes saw half of a face. "Good God!" she was about to utter, but the words died upon her lips, as the other half of that face became visible. She began to tremble from head to foot as she stared at that face, which was by no means a monstrous face, but one whose every feature was regular and beautiful. Yes, beautiful is the word. The cold, white moon shone through the white, cold clouds, upon that cold white face-a face composed of a forehead broad and smooth, with not a wrinkle upon it; a pair of eyes black and deep, if ever eyes were black and deep; lips thin and beautifully chiseled, exhibiting in their curves a peculiar firmness of decision. The forehead seemed to have passed through the sculptor's hand, so did the cheeks, nose, lips, and chin-in fact, the whole face seemed marble all over, with the exception of those eyes. Had they been closed you would have pronounced that face "DEATH IN MARBLE." Being open, it seemed a statue of "LIFE IN MARBLE." They lent if not an expression at least an intelligence to those features- made them look almost sweet-those features, pale as the moon, silent as the grave, and calm as death. Yes, the eyes were full of meaning, and as they looked from under their long, dreamy lashes and rested upon the trembling Jane's face, she imagined she saw a wronged spirit-a ghost, who had assumed her master's person to prophecy evil and to upbraid and chide them. "Go away," she attempted to articulate, but the terrible fear that had taken possession of her soul made her teeth chatter, so that she could not utter an intelligible sound. 
                  "Edgar Armhold-is he at home?" said the stranger, in a clear, deep voice, not knowing what terror his presence had created in the servant's heart. 
                  As stated elsewhere, it was one o'clock when the bell had first rung through the house and Jane had opened the door. The wind whistled and moaned now, and the clear, deep voice of the strange visitor, penetrating the still air, had something sepulchral about it. "Must see Edgar Armhold," he continued, dropping every superfluous word; "have come for that purpose." So saying, he drew nearer to the door. "O, God!" followed by a shriek, and the door was shut, from the inside, with a force that made the house tremble to its foundation. 
                  The stranger was locked out, and Jane ran through the passage, and up the flight of stairs, as if pursued by a thousand furies. 
                  "Good God! what's the matter?" said Hannah, turning pale at the appearance of her still trembling and wildly-glaring servant. "Speak! what has happened below?" 
                  "A ghost-" 
                  "A ghost of what?" 
                  "A ghost was below-" 
                  "You are foolish." 
                  "Looking precisely like my master," continued the girl, slowly regaining her self-composure. 
                  "You have lost your wits, girl," said Hannah, feigning to be angry, while she in fact felt a strange sensation, something like a chill, creep through her whole frame. "There are no ghosts; but if there were, they would not assume your master's guise. 'T was Mr. Armhold himself, worked into a ghost simply by your over-wrought imagination. What did he want?" 
                  "I tell you, ma'am," now said the girl, fully restored, "it was not Mr. Armhold, though it was the very image of him. It was his ghost; it couldn't have been any thing else." 
                  "Go to your bed, Jane. You are out of your wits. It was Mr. Armhold himself, and not his ghost, I tell you." 
                  So saying, she dismissed the girl, who was still as unshaken in her belief as when she had first left the house-door. No sooner had she said "good-night" and withdrawn, than Hannah took a seat and looked down upon the street. Her gaze was at first vague and distracted, but soon it became more fixed, until at last it seemed to pierce the darkness, through which the pale moon threw a paler light upon the opposite pavement, where, against the wall, she perceived a man, his arms knitted across his chest, and his head loftily raised toward the window, through the pane of which she could see his ghastly face. 
                  A shiver crept through her frame, and a faint sigh escaped her lips. "Who is that man?" she wondered, still keeping her eyes fixed upon him. "What can he want here? Is it Edgar? No! And yet Jane told me he looked like Edgar. How cold he must feel down there! I knew he would not go away, but only tried to frighten me. Still looking up, and still looking down. I wonder what he'll think of me suffering him to freeze before his own house, while I look at him so immovably? If he would but ring the bell once more, I-" here she interrupted herself, rose to her feet, and pressed her cheek against the window-pane. "Good God!" she exclaimed aloud, "who can this be? It is not Edgar; and yet that face, that form reminds me of him. I'll call Jane." 
                  But she had no need to call Jane. That faithful servant had just entered her mistress's room, and had approached her mistress's side. 
                  "Pardon me, ma'am, but I can't sleep," she said, in excuse for her intrusion; "I am afraid to stay alone. It was a ghost, I know it was;" and she closed her eyes, as if the object of her unnatural fear were still standing before her. 
                  "Look over there, Jane-look, look, as he moves away! Was that the ghost?" 
                  "Who?-which?-where?" whispered the girl, turning her face in the direction pointed out to her. 
                  "There! Can't you see him?" 
                  "No! Where?" 
                  "Too late-he's gone." And gone he was. 
                  Mistress and maid withdrew from the window, sat down before the hearth, and thoughtfully looked into the fire. 
                  "Go to bed, Jane." 
                  "Please let me remain here," whispered this faithful functionary. 
                  Hannah did not reply. And so the two still sat before the fire, neither the one nor the other speaking a word, until long after the town-clock had pealed the hour of four. 
                  The stranger in the mean time had arrived at his hotel, the door of which, owing to the lateness of the hour-it being past two o'clock-he had found locked. After ringing the bell several times, and waiting something like thirty minutes in the cold, he was at last admitted. 
                  "Rather late," grumbled the drowsy porter, with half-opened eyes. 
                  The stranger simply remarked, "Light me to my room," then slowly made his way to the stove and waited there until the porter had lighted a small oil-lamp, and expressed his readiness to show him up stairs. After they had reached the second floor, the stranger's eyes fell accidentally upon the other's countenance, upon which he suffered them constantly to rest, though that countenance was by no means a peculiar one. Then he fell back a pace, and remarked: 
                  "How long have you been a porter at the Gibson?" 
                  "Going on twelve months," said the other, slowly. 
                  "Always have been porter at hotels?" continued the stranger, still eying his conductor. 
                  "No; I was formerly packing clerk at James Montgomery's." 
                  "I presume you lost your situation at the time of his death?" 
                  "At whose death?" now said the porter, somewhat astonished. 
                  "At the death of Mr. Montgomery, who was killed some years ago." 
                  "He was never killed. You must be referring to quite another man; for this Montgomery, for whom I once worked, is still alive, and keeps a commission-house. Here, sir, this is your room." 
                  "And this is for your trouble;" and the stranger handed the porter several pieces of small change. 
                  "Thank you; can I do anything else for you?" 
                  "No-yes. I wish you would open the door for me, as my fingers are too much frozen to turn the key." 
                  "Certainly." 
                  "Where does this Montgomery reside?" asked the stranger. 
                  "He lives a good piece out on Ninth-street. I don't know precisely the number of his house, but I can find it out for you, if you wish it." 
                  "Never mind: you may now retire." 
                  As the porter was about to withdraw, the stranger once more accosted him. 
                  "Was not this Mr. Montgomery attacked by some ruffian some years ago? It strikes my mind that I have heard or read something to this effect." 
                  "O, yes, he was once knocked down, and left in almost a dying condition, lying on the street; but he got over his injuries soon afterward." 
                  "And what of the man who made the assault?" 
                  "Never caught him; don't know to this day who he was. Somehow, it never could be found out." 
                  "And, then, it never was found out?" 
                  "Never." 
                  "Never?" 
                  "No; even Mr. Montgomery has not the slightest suspicion." 
                  "You may retire." 
                  As the porter descended the stairs, he muttered to himself, "Who can this stranger be?" 
                
                
                  CHAPTER X. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              One sole desire, one passion now remains, 
                              To keep life's fever still within his veins: 
                              Vengeance-dire vengeance on the wretch who cast 
                              O'er him and all he loved that ruinous blast! 
                              For this he still lives on, careless of all 
                              The wreaths that glory on his path lets fall; 
                              For this alone exists-like lightning fire, 
                              To speed one bolt of vengeance and expire! 
                           
                         
                        MOORE'S "LALLA ROOKH." 
                      
                   
                  THE stranger, after the porter had left him, closed the door of his room, extinguished the dim light of the small oil-lamp, which had been left standing on the bureau for his use, and took a seat by the window. He evidently did not feel like retiring, although he had had scarcely any sleep or rest since his departure, on the morning of the third of November, from Sing Sing. He simply raised his arm to the window-sill, and suffered his head to recline upon his open palm, after which he looked, mechanically, absent-mindedly, into the dark space before him. Silence reigned supreme o'er all the house, but in no room reigned a greater silence than in the room occupied by the stranger. Had he been what he looked-a figure of marble-he could not have been more quiet and motionless. The breath of a slumbering infant might sooner have been heard than his. As he sat there-the pale white moon shining upon his still paler face-there was a peculiar calmness softening its stern, severe aspect. Fully awake himself, every feature seemed to slumber. They neither moved nor changed their expression-not even the deep, dark eyes. They simply exposed a cold and hard exterior, their transparency being that of a frozen element still freezing-dry and hard. An hour passed, and still that calmness rested on his face of ice. Not a lineament had moved, and yet a change had taken place. They had at first seemed to be cut in marble-but now in adamant. They appeared to be sharply carved in a material of impenetrable hardness, whose color was nearer green than white, with not enough of each to destroy the shade of either. But a greater change had taken place in his eyes. Water-clear, cold water-had flown over them from some rill hidden in that adamantine figure. It did not form in tears; it did not increase; it did not decrease: it simply looked one large tear-drop, crystalized and frozen over a pair of eyes which carried in their depths the color of midnight drifted from the Arctic zone. It was for full four hours that he sat thus by the window, engrossed in his own thoughts, scarcely conscious that the morning had dawned, and that many of the lodgers had already risen and gone down stairs to take a "warm" by the well-heated stove in the office. He now awoke from his reverie, looked down upon the street for a moment, breathed a long sigh, wetted his parched lips with the tip of his tongue, and then, rising to his feet, he slowly crossed to the wash-stand, made a hasty toilet, and repaired also to the office. Having arrived there, he went to the counter and wrote his name in the register. He then picked up the Commercial, and, after seating himself in the reading-room, perused it until the bell announced that breakfast was ready. Laying the paper aside, he followed a number of gentlemen into the dining-hall. 
                  "What will you have, sir?" inquired the waiter. 
                  Without looking around, in a voice clear and deep-"A glass of water and some bread." 
                  "No coffee?" 
                  "A glass of water and some bread." 
                  And a glass of water and some bread were handed him. The water looked as cold and clear as the eyes of the stranger who had ordered it, and the bread looked as dry and hard as the face of the stranger who was to eat it. 
                  He was the first to rise from the table and leave the hall. Arrived in the reading-room, he once more picked up the morning paper and cast his eyes over it. The morning was considerably advanced, and a few lodgers were still lounging about the hotel, when the stranger laid the paper aside, thoughtfully raised his calm face toward the ceiling, and fell into a reverie. Soon, however, he rose, entered the reception-hall, picked a wooden toothpick from a box on the clerk's desk, placed it between his teeth, and slowly made his way out of the house. Twenty minutes afterward he was on Ninth-street, standing before Mr. James Montgomery's residence, ringing the bell. As he stood there, wrapped in his own thoughts, he but indistinctly heard the silvery laugh emanating from the hall within. 
                  The door flew open, and a bright-eyed, golden-haired, rosy-cheeked, dimple-faced, and mischievous-looking girl, of something near sixteen summers, stepped out upon the door-sill. 
                  The stranger, in a sonorous voice, asked: 
                  "Good morning. Is Mr. Montgomery in, and can I have the pleasure of seeing him?" 
                  "O yes, 'pa is in. Please step into the parlor for a minute-he'll be here presently." 
                  "Thank you." 
                  "The stranger went into the parlor, and the bright-eyed, golden-haired, rosy-cheeked, dimple-faced and mischievous-looking girl of something near sixteen summers, hastily shut the front door and lightly stepped, her feet scarcely touching the floor, across the frescoed hall. 
                  "'Pa, some one wishes to see you," she said, entering the sitting-room, and accosting her father, who sat in his easy chair, reading. 
                  Mr. Montgomery raised his eyes and said, "Who wishes to see me, Nellie?" 
                  "Who? I'm sure I don't know, 'pa. Some young gentleman, that's all I know." 
                  "Where did you leave him?" 
                  "I invited him into the parlor." 
                  Mr. Montgomery rose from his easy chair and left the room. He had called his daughter by the name of "Nellie," and Nellie left the room after him. When Mr. Montgomery had reached the parlor-door, Nellie had reached the parlor-door also, and was looking at the stranger from behind her father's back and from over her father's shoulder. She remained only for a second, for the next moment found her dancing back, humming a lively air, into the family-room." 
                  The shutters of the parlor-windows were partly closed, excluding, to a great extent, the light. And Mr. Montgomery's eyes were rather weak-too much so to recognize any one in this dark room not standing near him. And the stranger stood several paces apart from him. Mr. Montgomery could indistinctly see a graceful figure standing like a statue in the center of the room, but he did not see how this graceful figure's face turned ashen as his eyes fell upon it. 
                  "Rather dark, this room," said Mr. Montgomery, advancing a step. Then turning around and moving toward the door, and in a louder voice-"Lizzie!" This was the servant girl's name. But Lizzie didn't come; it was Nellie, his daughter, who came. 
                  "What do you want, 'pa?" she said, in a silvery voice. 
                  "I want more light, daughter," then to the stranger, "be seated, sir;" and both Mr. Montgomery and the stranger took seats-the former near the door, the latter opposite the window just opened by the bright-eyed Nellie. 
                  As Nellie turned around and asked 'pa, "Is it light enough?" and 'pa answered, "It is, daughter," she suffered her laughing blue eyes to rest upon the stranger's pale face just when the stranger's pale face was turned toward her, and the glance of his sad black eyes met the glance of her laughing blue eyes. 
                  "Nothing else, 'pa?" 
                  'Pa answered that he wanted nothing else, and Nellie retired, but not until she had once more gazed into the stranger's face. 
                  "Good-looking fellow; splendid face and figure, but don't like him," she partly thought and partly whispered to herself, as she entered the hall, leaving her father and the stranger together. 
                  Her father didn't seem to be acquainted with his visitor, and therefore was about to ask "name and busines," when visitor rose to his feet and said, in a clear, deep, metallic voice: 
                  "I perceive you do not recognize me." 
                  "Indeed I do not," replied Mr. Montgomery, with considerable emphasis, at the same time leaning forward and scrutinizing the stranger from head to foot. "Indeed, I do not recognize you," he repeated, after a brief pause, then comfortably fell back again into his seat. 
                  Then the stranger, cool and self-possessed: 
                  "Perhaps 'tis better as it is." A pause, and then-"Mr. Montgomery, we are no strangers. Though I may have passed out of your memory, believe me, sir, you have never passed out of mine. 
                  Another pause. The old gentleman, leaning forward, opened his eyes a little wider. He gazed inquiringly into the pale face of the cool, self-collected stranger, but with no better success than at his previous scrutiny. 
                  Thus the stranger: 
                  "I am indebted to you to the amount of eight hundred dollars. I have come to liquidate part of the debt." 
                  "I do not keep the books, sir," said Mr. Montgomery, somewhat amused. "The office down town is the proper place for making settlements. Indeed, sir, I know nothing at all about your indebtedness." 
                  "When you are apprised of my name," continued the stranger, in the same clear, deep, metallic voice with which he had at first commenced to address Mr. Mongomery, "you will no longer seem astonished that I have chosen this method of liquidating my indebtedness.-My name is Reuben Armhold." 
                  "Reuben Armhold!" exclaimed the old man, scarcely believing his senses. 
                  "Yes; Reuben Armhold. Here," and he laid several bank-notes on the table, "are three hundred and fifty dollars-I have no more to give; take them. Now, do with me whatever you will." 
                  So saying, he folded his arms across his breast, and calmly awaited the result of his remarks. 
                  Mr. Montgomery rose from his chair and approached his visitor. "As I live, 'tis Reuben Armhold,' he said, a smile lighting up his face, "though, I must confess, I should not have recognized you. You have grown considerably older, and judging by your looks, steadier since last I saw you. Sit down-sit down;" and Mr. Montgomery retraced his steps and sat down in his chair. Reuben, however, remained upon his feet. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery, I have not come," he commenced, "to ask you to forgive me. I am not worthy to be pardoned, and I don't care to be pardoned. I have robbed you and almost deprived you of your life-two crimes of which I plead guilty-two crimes for which I should be punished. Mr. Montgomery-I have come to receive that punishment." 
                  "If you won't sit down and dispense with that peculiar gravity of speech and demeanor," added Mr. Montgomery, "I shall have to address you as Mr. Armhold, not as 'Reuben.' I want you to understand that what's past is past, and that of having any ill-feeling toward you, I am very glad to see you back among us. Therefore, sit down and thaw a little, young man, for I assure you, you have a freezing look." 
                  "One word, Mr. Montgomery. Have you honestly no ill-feelings toward me? Have you really spared from exposure the villain who now stands before you? Are the crimes, then, still a secret to all-" 
                  "-except to me and your esteemed brother, Edgar Armhold," added the old man. 
                  Reuben advanced a few paces, and continued in a voice that seemed shattered by suppressed emotion-"I should reach you my hand, but"-here he paused a moment-"I can not. It would stain your honest palm." 
                  "Nonsense, boy. Here, give me your hand, for, as I said before, I am truly glad to see you back. Don't think you have been entirely forgotten by us, for you have not. Edgar and I have repeatedly spoken of you, and it was but a fortnight ago that he expressed his regret at not knowing your whereabouts. Now, sit down, put this money back from whence you took it, (for those eight hundred dollars have long since been liquidated by Edgar,) and tell me where you've been, what you've been doing, etc. But let me not ask you again to sit down. To see you stand here, as if you were rooted to the floor, makes me feel uneasy. Now-that's right," as Reuben did as he was requested. "That's right, only move your chair closer to mine. Now." And Mr. Montgomery continued: "But, by George, you have grown older and steadier. I am led to believe 'away from home' has taught you a lesson. What has become of all your life-your spirit, man? You have changed as never I knew any one to change before." In this manner the talkative old gentleman, being at the same time in a very good humor, rattled off several other remarks, at last winding up with, "But you haven't told me yet where you have been keeping yourself all this time?" 
                  "Do not ask me, sir, for I can not tell you," replied Reuben, riveting his eyes on the floor. 
                  "You seem to have fared but poorly-that much I can see." 
                  Reuben raised his pale face, but said nothing. He thought of Sing Sing, and his cheeks grew a little whiter. 
                  "I detain you, Mr. Montgomery," he said at last. "Let me leave you, for I am unfit for any thing just now. Excuse my rudeness, excuse my boldness, excuse my-excuse me. You see I can't speak." 
                  "Are you sick?" 
                  "No, sir." 
                  "Your color is not a very healthy one." 
                  "It is my natural color." 
                  "Well, I don't wish to be rude, indeed," added Mr. Montgomery, apologetically. 
                   
                  "Don't think I wish to dive into your secrets, for nothing can be further from my purpose. I am simply taking great interest in you." 
                  "It is the interest you seem to take in me that thus confounds me. I expected to meet frowns, and was prepared for nothing but frowns. Smiles and kindnesses rather irritate than soften my temper. So let me take my leave; you see I can not speak." 
                  "Well, you do speak as if you had mixed in rather queer society." 
                  Reuben Armhold rose to his feet and looked for his hat, without answering this last remark. He thought of convicts, and was anxious to leave. 
                  "You are not going already?" said Mr. Montgomery. 
                  "I am." 
                  "And when shall I see you again?" 
                  "I don't know. Perhaps never." 
                  "Perhaps never? You surely have no idea of leaving again?" 
                  "I have." 
                  Mr. Montgomery looked into Reuben's pale face, and shook his head, saying: 
                  "There is something, Reuben, which lies heavily at your heart. I don't want to know what it is, but would simply suggest to you the folly of grieving over anything that may have happened to you." 
                  "Thank you. Let me go. You see that I am not fit to be here. I say again, excuse me. I may see you again, if you allow me to call-but now, now, I even can't thank you for your magnanimous conduct toward me." 
                  Having expressed thus abruptly, but no less abruptly than emphatically, his unfitness to remain in the company of his former employer, whose liberality, so unexpectedly shown, had almost stunned him, Reuben Armhold slowly, and with a dignified gait, proceeded toward the door with the intention of taking his departure. Arrived at the door, he once more turned around and thoughtfully rested his eyes on Mr. James Montgomery's open countenance. The one hand that had been lying upon the knob, Reuben now removed, and placed it on his breast, and under his coat. After the lapse of a moment, during which brief time the two-the released convict and the wealthy merchant prince-had carefully searched each other's countenance, the former advanced a single pace, and, after tightly compressing his already tightly-compressed lips, uttered in a clear, deep voice, while a single wrinkle, caused by some unseen spring from within, divided the upper from the lower portion of his brow, the following sentence: 
                  "You have spared me, sir." 
                  "Have I not already told you that, save your brother and myself, no one knows the least of what has occurred between us?" replied Mr. Montgomery, restlessly moving on his seat from one position to another. 
                  "Not even his wife?" 
                  "Not even his wife." 
                  Mr. Montgomery was telling a falsehood; but Edgar had often told him that, in the event of Reuben's return, the latter should never learn that Hannah was also in possession of the knowledge of his guilt. 
                  "To what am I indebted for this exhibition of magnanimity?" asked Reuben, after a short pause. 
                  "To what? To whom? To Edgar Armhold, your brother, to be sure. It was he, and nobody else, who came to me and pleaded your cause; it was he who taught me to give you my pity instead of my hate; and it was he who, after he had gained that object, promised to pay, and since then has paid-and cheerfully, too-the debt of his erring brother." 
                  "Edgar never loved his twin-brother. If he had-if he had-" Reuben thought of the letter he had sent to Edgar from New York, which, had it been answered, might have saved him from the convict's doom. But, as the reader is already informed, that letter had never reached Cincinnati, though Reuben did not know it. "Yes, if he had loved me," he continued, with a little more emphasis, "how much misery might have been averted!" Here he checked himself as if he had already spoken more than he had intended to speak. 
                  "Sit down a moment, will you, Reuben Armhold? It is still early, and since you are here, and have commenced to make Edgar the subject of our remarks, I should be pleased to ask you several questions; for you must know that your brother and I are most particular friends." 
                  Reuben, without any further hesitation, laid his hat aside and sat down. 
                  Mr. Montgomery continued: 
                  "You are undoubtedly aware that your parents-" Just then Mr. Montgomery perceived how the face of his listener changed color, and how a hard, glistening tear plowed its way down his calm, stony cheeks, and he ended his phrase, "You know it, then?" 
                  "I do." These words were uttered in a low, hard, dry tone, as if they had passed through a throat of rough stone. "I know how they died." A shiver moved his frame. 
                  "Well, Edgar may have told you how they suffered and died," added Mr. Montgomery; "but I'm confident he never has told you-" 
                  "He has never told me any thing," interrupted Reuben. 
                  "He has never told you any thing? Who has, then?" 
                  Reuben related how he, on his arrival in the city, had visited his former home, and what information he had gained from the old woman he found occupying the room his own parents had occupied before he had taken his flight. 
                  "Then you haven't been to see your brother Edgar?" 
                   
                  "I was at his house last night, but gained no admittance. It was late, very late, when I rung the bell, and the servant who answered it, after looking into my face, became frightened at my appearance, and slammed the door against me." 
                  Mr. Montgomery began to smile, as he suffered his eyes to rest upon the stony face of Reuben, which not even for a moment changed or softened its set features. 
                  "Well, upon my word, your face, seen at midnight, is enough to frighten any ordinary person who has the least belief in ghosts." 
                  "I know that I am but a shadow of my former self. Do you think I shall find my brother at home this morning, or is his office away from his private residence?" inquired Reuben, leading the conversation away from himself. 
                  "He keeps his office at his residence; but were it even otherwise," remarked Montgomery, "you would most assuredly find your brother at home, for he has been ill for some time, and of late, I am sorry to say, too ill to leave his premises, unless on very urgent business." 
                  Reuben Armhold did not reply. He simply raised his head, and vaguely gazed toward the opposite wall. 
                  "It is for that purpose that I should like to speak to you," added Mr. Montgomery, drawing himself up in his chair, his voice growing somewhat lower, while his face assumed a more anxious expression. Seeing that he had not succeeded in attracting Reuben's attention, who was still gazing at the opposite wall, he once more repeated: "It is for that purpose that I should like to speak to you." 
                  Reuben lowered his face, and after eying his former employer for a moment, whose anxious look he now observed for the first time, said: 
                  "It is for that purpose that you would like to speak to me? What purpose?" 
                  "I had reference to your brother's illness." 
                  "Mr. Montgomery, as I have stated before, I am unfit for any prolonged conversation. Circumstances-it matters little what they are-have made me callous to every thing, and have given birth to an all-absorbing indifference as to what may concern me individually. But you speak not now of me, but of a brother of mine-a brother who is ill, very ill, and with whose illness there seems, judging by your ambiguous remarks, to be connected a story I ought to be made acquainted with before I see him." 
                  "Precisely so," remarked Mr. Montgomery, considerably relieved by the correct surmise of Reuben. "Precisely so," he continued, looking around in order to assure himself that no one else was near to listen to what he was about to say. "There is a story connected with this illness of your brother, with which, with the exception of his wife, myself, and one or two other persons, no one seems to be familiar." 
                  "And what is that story, sir?" 
                  "Well, young man, this is an easily-asked question; but when it comes to being answered," replied Mr. Montgomery, "then one discovers that it is not so easy a task. First, let me tell you that your brother is a most extraordinary person, no less in respect to his mind than to his heart. Both are richly endowed-the former with an intellect clear and deep, and the latter with qualities rare and precious. Now, both combined have rendered him one of the most sensitive of men. The least neglect assumes, in his eyes, the greatest proportions imaginable. It makes him miserable, it destroys his happiness; in short, it unmans him completely. And neglect has been shown him, Reuben," he continued, more earnestly and with greater emphasis, "and that by a being in whom he had centered all his hopes and affections. By what I have told you, it can no longer surprise you to hear that the being who thus neglects him is no less a person than his own wife. Yes, Reuben Armhold, when your honest and simple-minded brother married Hannah Preston-I presume you know that she was the daughter of Mr. James Preston, his former employer-it was owing to his great love for her that he did so. And she professed to love him in return, and the unsophisticated youth believed her!" 
                  "And he," added Reuben, "has since discovered that she does not love him. Is not this what you would wish to tell me?" 
                  "Precisely so, precisely so; you have hit the nail right on the head," said Mr. Montgomery. "She does not love him, and, fool as he is-I hope you will excuse this expression, but I assure you it is a very applicable one here-yes, fool as he is, he still dotes upon her." 
                  "And is this the only cause of his illness?" coolly remarked Reuben Armhold. 
                  "'And is this the only cause of his illness?' you ask?" hurriedly exclaimed Mr. Montgomery, almost rising from his seat. "Is it not cause enough? To have a wife who, by every look and mien, gives her husband to understand that she does not love him, and that his presence makes her miserable? Do you think that such conduct is not more than enough to sicken so sensitive a person as your brother? I tell you, sir, it has almost killed him. He is scarcely the skeleton of what he was. Why, man, read his last work, 'The Desert of the Heart,' and you can discover in the trials of its hero part of his own. If he keeps on grieving, I fear he will never die an old man. O, he has fearfully changed of late. No longer are any smiles to be seen on his face." 
                  So saying, he lowered his eyes, and sadly shook his head. 
                  Reuben, who had attentively listened, had not changed the expression of his face in the least. At times, he had suffered the tip of his tongue to wet his sharpened whitish lips, but that was all. Not for a moment had he taken his eyes from Mr. Montgomery's countenance; but now he pressed his eyelids together as if he wished to drive away something unpleasant; this, however, lasted but for a second. 
                  "And is my brother a father?" he said, slowly. 
                  "He is. He has a splendid boy." 
                  A silence of some minutes ensued. Reuben Armhold was the first to break it. 
                  "Would you object to telling me something of my brother's late career?" he said; "I have heard nothing of or from him since the eve of my flight from this city. I have twice addressed letters to him, but he has never answerd them." 
                  "If you have ever sent any letters to him," replied Mr. Montgomery, "it is certain that he has never received them; for if he had, he would not have kept it secret from me. But," and here he drew his chair closer to the one occupied by Reuben, "but that's neither here nor there now. You want to know something of Edgar's life, and I believe I can give you about as much of it as he himself could. We have been warm friends for years, and hope to remain so as long as we shall live. But now, no further digressions." 
                  And no further digressions were made. 
                  Mr. Montgomery commenced at the commencement; namely, from the period Edgar had for the first time called upon him, on the morning subsequent to Reuben's flight. It must be stated here that Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Armhold had really become warm friends, and, indeed, so great was this attachment that the latter had confided in the former the chief trials he had undergone, and these now were told in a feeling manner to Reuben, who listened to the sad recital with an attention bordering almost on absorption. He did not interrupt-not even with a single word-the narrator, but calmly waited until the latter observed a pause, when he said: 
                  "And all this my brother has suffered?" 
                  "All this, and more than this," continued Mr. Montgomery. "You know a man may have trials of which he won't speak, and may hide many sorrows even from his dearest friend. And so did Edgar. No sooner had he been married a year than I discovered a change in his behavior. I could not help seeing that there was something wrong with him. He was no longer joyful; he became reserved and reticent. The healthy hue left his cheeks, and he daily grew thinner. He no longer received or went into company, and always had some excuse ready. Sadness, aye, unhappiness, was written in every lineament of his face. As I remarked, I was not slow to detect it, but it was not so easy to discover the cause. For your brother," continued Mr. Montgomery, with more emphasis, "had then achieved both wealth and reputation. He had gained a position that was truly an enviable one. No one stood higher than he, and society considered him its proudest, worthiest ornament. One day I took courage to ask him the cause of this change. He gave me but evasive answers. Soon, however, I discovered-not through him, but through my daughter-the girl who has admitted you-the cause of his silent grief. I must here inform you that Nellie-that's my daughter's name-yes, that Nellie and Lionel Harrington, who is a cousin to your brother's wife, have been schoolmates, and very often meet, as young people will, now at this place and then again at another. Now, this Lionel Harrington has told Nellie, and she has told me, that there was but little love existing between his cousin and her husband-in fact, he made Nellie plainly understand that Miss Hannah Preston-for that was her former name, and I'm sorry that she ever changed it to what she did-yes, that Hannah regretted the step she had taken, namely, in becoming Mrs. Armhold, and that she had told her husband more than once his presence threw a cloud upon her life. I could scarcely believe it. I waited for a good opportunity to gain some more information upon this subject; for, Reuben, as I have remarked before, your brother has become to me as a son-I love him as such-and I gained some more information. 
                  "Proceed, sir," said Reuben, impatiently. 
                  "Well, as I have remarked," continued Mr. Montgomery, "I gained some more information, through our worthy minister, Rev. Mr. Broadwell, to whose congregation the Prestons and the Harringtons belong. We met one day, something over a year ago, at your brother's house. I perceived then that your brother showed little courtesy to Mr. Broadwell, who was paying, however, the more attention to Mrs. Armhold; in fact, they scarcely spoke to one another. So when I left, in company with Mr. Broadwell, an hour later, I made bold to ask him what he thought of the family we had just left." 
                  "In what respect?" asked he, as we leisurely walked down Freeman street. 
                  "In what respect?" repeated I, looking down on the pavement, for I feared he could read in my face what I was driving at. 'In respect to their married life-do you think they are happy?' 
                  "'No!' he replied. 'I know Mrs. Armhold is not happy, is even unhappy, and there's not an hour in the day that she does not regret being Mrs. Armhold.'" 
                  "Having calmly listened to this, I waited a moment, and asked: 
                  "'Doctor, I can't see, for the life of me, why this woman should not be happy. I'm sure, Mr. Armhold treats her with the greatest est respect; more than that, he loves her, and to be loved by such a man, should make any woman happy,' I said, with considerable emphasis, for I simply stated my sincerest belief. 
                  "'You seem to have forgotten that Mr. Armhold is a Jew, and Mrs. Armhold a Christian,' he remarked to me, after which he paused for a moment, and then added: 'Conscientious scruples make her miserable. She knows that she has done wrong in marrying a man who denies Christ Jesus as the Redeemer. She has confided this feeling to me, and begged me to pray for her and stand by her in the hour of need-and I do stand by her,' he continued in a firm voice; 'Mr. Armhold has destroyed the happiness of her life-he shall not contaminate her soul. She has again thrown herself in the arms of our church, and I shall watch over and strengthen her.' With this he broke off and became silent. We walked together for several squares, but without referring again to the topic. He studiously avoided any remark that might have let back into the same channel. 
                  "On the following day I visited my friend, your brother. I kept nothing back. I told him all that I had heard, and he listened as calmly to me then as you do now. When I was done, he shook my hand warmly, and said: 
                  "'Mr. Montgomery, I thank you for the interest you continually evince in my behalf; I am too great a debtor ever to be able to pay you. Yet I must ask you another favor-and I know, I feel assured, that you will grant it. Never, as you love me, Mr. Montgomery, refer to this topic again. Hannah Preston is my wife, and wife and husband are one. If she no longer loves me, interference on the part of others will not-can not purchase back that love. So let it be as it is; time may mend the matter. But had my Hannah never seen Rev. Mr. Broadwell, had she never listened to his voice, she would this day be to me as faithful and loving a wife, as she promised to be on the day of our marriage. Rev. Mr. Broadwell has robbed me of my Hannah's love-I forgive him, and shall forbear. Mr. Montgomery, pray, as you love me, never refer to this matter again; I know my duty, and shall labor to be equal to it." 
                  "So spoke your brother, and from that day we have never mentioned the subject." 
                  Here Mr. Montgomery stopped, leaned back upon his seat, and took a breath. 
                  "Will you favor me with your company to his house?" inquired Reuben, rising from his seat, his face as calm and pale as ever. 
                  "If you wish it-yes; but I deem it better that you should meet him first in private," replied the old gentleman. 
                  "Perhaps it would be better. I shall go alone. But before I leave you: what sort of a man is this Rev. Dr. Broadwell?" 
                  "He is still a young man, some three or four years your senior-a very eloquent and popular minister." Then interrupting himself-"We have his photograph. I can show it to you." So saying, he opened an album that was lying on the table. "This is his likeness." 
                  Reuben advanced, slowly picked up the album, and walked with it to the window. Here he looked upon the picture, and, as he did so, his whole face turned a sickly green, his eyes began to roll like balls of fire, and his hand trembled like an aspen. 
                  "Is this the Rev. Dr. Broadwell?" he hissed, still glaring on that picture. "Is this he? Is it? Is it?--It is! It is! O, God!' he shouted, a fiendish smile passing over his lips, and dropping the album, raised his hands heavenward. "What have I done to deserve so great a blessing! This is Broadwell! ha! ha! ha!" 
                  A moment later he was again the adamantine figure. Passion had subsided, and he looked again-rock. Five minutes later he was on his way to the Gibson House, and still a half hour later he stood before his brother's house, in which his brother's wife was just entertaining another visitor who was no less a person than his brother's enemy-the Rev. Dr. Broadwell. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Do not, if one but lightly thee offend, 
                              The punishment beyond the crime extend; 
                              Or after warning the offense forget; 
                              So God himself our failings did remit. 
                           
                         
                        ORGULA, OR THE FATED ERROR. 
                      
                   
                  MANY of our readers will agree with us in saying that the most unpardonable blunders are frequently committed-and that by the wisest persons, too-when our deepest interests are at stake, requiring of us the greatest circumspection to avoid the pending danger. Hannah, who, on ordinary occasions, despite her haughtiness, was generally cool and self-possessed, and always thought over the consequences before shaping her course of conduct, never committed a graver error, as the sequel will show, than when she, perplexed as to what steps to take under these trying circumstances-namely, after her husband had forsaken her-resolved to make the Rev. Dr. Broadwell her confidant. What it was that made her ignore the existence of a father, mother and brother and think only of a stranger (and that stranger, too, the very person whose acquaintance she had dropped), just at a time when the soundest counsel was required, and those who had the deepest interest in her welfare should have been consulted, belongs to those phenomena for which the deepest thinker can assign no reason. 
                   
                  "Jane," she said, after she had partaken of a light breakfast, on the morning after her husband's departure, "Jane, put on a clean dress, and come up to my room." 
                  When Jane, some fifteen minutes later, stood before her mistress, in her mistress's own room, she could read in the latter's countenance the suppressed anguish of her soul. 
                  "Jane," said Hannah, placing a small and nicely-folded note into her faithful servant's hand, "Jane, you know where Mr. Broadwell's rooms are?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  "Take this note to him, will you?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  The servant was about to retire-was already at the door-when her mistress recalled her. 
                  "Jane." 
                  "What is it, ma'am?" 
                  "Wait for an answer." 
                  "I will." 
                  "Jane." 
                  The girl looked wistfully into her mistress's sad face as she retraced her steps, saying, in a sympathetic voice: 
                  "You want something else of me? You know I will do it for you, ma'am, you know I will." So saying, she pressed a kiss upon her mistress's hand. 
                  "Don't," answered Hannah, as if she were displeased at this manifestation of sympathy; then turning around; haughtily walked toward the window, where she, while looking through the panes, unperceived, as she erroneously thought, wiped a tear from her eyes. Soon, however, she overcame that weakness, and, retracing her steps, said: 
                  "Do the servants about the house know of Mr. Armhold's departure?" 
                  "No, ma'am; how should they?" argued the girl. "You know that for weeks Mr. Armhold has never shown his face, and, as I have been the only one who has waited on him since his illness, I know not how his absence should have been discovered so soon." 
                  Hannah slowly walked across the room and back. 
                  "Who packed his trunks?" she inquired. 
                  "I don't know, ma'am. Though I presume he packed them himself." 
                  "Do you think no one about the house assisted him?" 
                  "I am confident no one did," Jane added, with a tone of assurance; for such a thing would have raised suspicion at once, and every servant in your employ would know all about it by this time." 
                  Again Hannah walked across the room and back. One could see in her face that she was not yet quite satisfied. 
                  "Do you know who took the trunks away?" she inquired, after a short pause. 
                  "It was a stranger to whom he had given the order," Jane replied. 
                  "What order?" 
                  "To take the trunks down to the mail boat." 
                  "To take them down to the mail-boat?" Hannah repeated. 
                  "Yes, ma'am." 
                  "What mail-boat?" 
                  "Indeed, I don't know, ma'am." 
                  "I know of no mail-boat that leaves at night; do you?" 
                  "What should I know about these things, ma'am?" Jane replied, shrugging her shoulders. "I never traveled much." 
                  "Nor I, nor I;" and Mrs. Armhold crossed over to the window, looking down upon the street, Jane still standing in the center of the room, holding the small note, she was to deliver to the Rev. Dr. Broadwell, in her hand. 
                  "Shall I go now?" she inquired, after a short pause. Hannah turned around, and, after looking at her servant for a second, said: 
                  "Go where?" 
                  "To deliver this note to Mr. Broadwell." 
                  "No. Hand the letter back to me, or-stop: put it in your pocket;" and after Jane had done so, Hannah continued, "Now go into Mr. Armhold's room." 
                  "And what shall I do there?" inquired the servant, not quite understanding what was required of her. 
                  "What shall you do? Nothing. Just go and see-" 
                  "What?" 
                  "Just what you can see. Do you hear? Now go." 
                  Jane went. A few minutes brought her again into her mistress's presence, who was still restlessly pacing the floor. As Hannah saw the servant enter, she stopped in the middle of the room, and asked: 
                  "Are the trunks gone?" 
                  "No." 
                  "I thought so." 
                  Hannah elevated her figure as high as she could raise it. One might have supposed she had placed herself on tip-toe. She seemed to have grown taller by some inches, as she held her head proudly erect, and riveted her glistening eyes upon her servant. 
                  "Then the trunks are not gone!" she continued, a bitter smile passing over her thinly-cut lips; "then the trunks are not gone, though he has given the order that they should be taken to the mail-boat!" 
                  "No, ma'am," replied Jane; "they are still in his room." 
                  "Jane," commenced Hannah, abruptly. 
                  "Ma'am?" 
                  "You know upon what footing Mr. Armhold and I have stood for some time. You can't have been so dull as not to have perceived our estrangement, though you have feigned ignorance, which, at times, is a very commendable virtue in a servant." 
                  Jane, not knowing what to answer, kept silent. So Hannah, who, judging by her looks and peculiar intonation of voice, was evidently laboring under considerable excitement, continued after s short pause: 
                  "Do you know that's a trick?" 
                  "What's a trick, ma'am?" 
                  "You are a dunce, Jane. I say, it is a trick, and no one else can make me believe otherwise." 
                  "I know I am a dunce," humbly confessed the faithful servant in a low voice, her head reclining over her bosom. Hannah saw the impression her remark had left, and, as usual, felt sorry at having caused unnecessary pain. 
                  "I don't mean you are a dunce, you know I don't," she remarked; "so raise your head and don't be so sensitive. You ought to know me by this time." 
                  "I know you have a good heart, ma'am, and don't mean to hurt my feelings," replied the girl, in a low broken voice, after which Hannah continued in the same strain: 
                  "When I say it is a trick, Jane, I simply have reference to the conduct of my worthy husband, Mr. Edgar Armhold. He knows that you are my favorite servant-" 
                  "Thank you-" 
                  "Be still, Jane. He knows that you are my favorite servant, and that you would report any thing to me that concerned me as much as his going away. Now in order to frighten me-knowing that you would tell me-he gave this order about his trunks in your presence-don't you understand?-he feeling confident that you would report to me at once what you had heard. Jane, the trunks are still here, and, more than that, Mr. Armhold is still in the city. His whole conduct is a cowardly one." 
                  Jane undoubtedly had long since observed that an estrangement, for some reason unknown to her, existed between Mr. Armhold and his wife, but until now she had never known to what extent this estrangement had been carried. Therefore, when she heard her mistress call the conduct of her husband a "cowardly one," she shrunk into herself, and, not being of an inquisitive disposition, fain would have heard no more. She did not wish to dive into the secrets of others, and, least of all, into the secrets of the family in whose service she was employed. Now, in order to escape the presence of Hannah, she said, timidly looking upon the plush carpet with which the floor was covered: "Shall I go now to deliver this note, as you have instructed me?" 
                  "Wait a moment;" and Hannah lowered her head and placed the index-finger of her right hand against her closed lips, and began to study. "Wait a minute," she repeated; then, after a silence of some seconds, she removed her finger and raised her head, saying: "Jane, go once more into Mr. Armhold's room. You know he has also a traveling trunk; it always hung against the wall to the left of the door. See whether it is still there." 
                  With this remark she dismissed the servant, who shortly after returned. 
                  "Well?" remarked Hannah, a bitter smile of triumph still on her lips. "Well, the traveling-trunk is there?" 
                  "No, ma'am, the traveling trunk is not there." 
                  No sooner had Hannah heard this report, than that bitter smile of triumph disappeared from her lips, and a pallor spread across her cheeks. This little bit of news-namely, that the traveling-trunk "was not there," made her dejected and crestfallen. 
                  "Not there?" she more sighed than spoke. 
                  "No, ma'am," replied the girl; "I have carefully looked for it throughout the room." 
                  "Not there, not there?" repeated Hannah to herself, and very slowly and thoughtfully walked across the room. For nearly five minutes not a word was uttered, Jane sympathizingly watching the mistress who had so often shown her so many kindnesses, and who was now so greatly troubled and perplexed. Not knowing what to do, and feeling that she should do something, she simply said: 
                  "Can't I do any thing for you, ma'am?" 
                  "Can't I do any thing for you, ma'am?" This question aroused Hannah's spirit, and once more she was the proud, haughty woman. She raised her head, and again a bitter smile trembled upon her lips. What! Had she become so low that she must be pitied even by a servant? No; though her husband had taken his departure, was she not still the daughter of the wealthy Mr. Preston? "You shall do for me nothing but what I order you to do-nothing," she said haughtily. "I want you to understand that you are simply my servant, whose sympathy, were I even in need of any, should be the last I'd require or ask for." 
                  "O, ma'am, excuse me," Jane sobbed now; "I did not mean to offend-" 
                  Hannah did not suffer her to finish the sentence. She thrust several pieces of small coin into the girl's hand, told her to be off at once, and to deliver the note she had given her to the Rev. Dr. Broadwell. 
                  "Shall I wait for an answer?" Jane asked, drying her eyes. 
                  Hannah reflected for a moment, and said: 
                  "You may wait until he has read the note. Probably he will send a reply." 
                  With these instructions, Jane retired from the room of her mistress, and went upon her mission. Hannah, left to herself, took a seat upon a chair, and began to weep bitter, burning tears. O, how her heart ached within her! It was so very, very heavy; and still, though she wept plentifully and the tears flowed freely, the weight became no less. Like a millstone it seemed to press her down. She thought over the events of the last few days, and still she could not bring herself to acknowledge that she had done wrong, or that she could have arrested this sad catastrophe. Owing to this untold misery, she had commenced to weep, but not for a moment regretting the course she had pursued toward her husband. "Gone, or not gone," she said at last, angrily tossing her head aloft, "I'll not give way, though it cost me my life. Who is he, that I should stoop to him? A Jew, and nothing but a Jew. I'll show him what it is to play with my feelings! Yes, sooner will I die by my own hands than ask him-him"-and a dark frown passed over her marble brow-"to forgive my waywardness, my wrong-Pshaw!" she abruptly broke out, "as if I had done him wrong!" So saying, she fell into a reverie, and a few minutes afterward she was again in tears. 
                  We will now follow Jane for a brief time. After she had left her mistress's presence, she walked as far as the crossing, where she entered a street-car that took her down Fifth-street, when she got out and hastily made her way through several other blocks. 
                  "This is the house," she said to herself, as she gazed upon a splendid building which stood in front of her. "I hope he is still at home." 
                  She rung the bell, and a servant came to the door. 
                  "I should like to see Mr. Broadwell." 
                  "What do you want to see Mr. Broadwell for?" inquired the servant at the door. 
                  "I want to see Mr. Broadwell upon business not in the least concerning you," Jane coolly retorted. "Is Mr. Broadwell at home?" 
                  "No!" and the servant slammed the door in her face. 
                  Jane was about to descend the few stiles, when who should make his appearance but the very person she had come to see, the Rev. Dr. Broadwell. 
                  "Good morning," she said, bowing; "I have a note for you, Mr. Broadwell." 
                  "You have?" he said, a pleasant smile upon his lips. "You have? Come in, come in;" and he opened the door, to which he had a key, and admitted Jane. No sooner were they in the hall than he broke the seal of the note, and, while slowly walking along the passage-Jane equally as slowly following behind him-made himself acquainted with its contents. After he got through reading the note, he refolded the same and replaced it into the envelope, saying, in the most nonchalant manner possible: 
                  "I hope Mr. and Mrs. Armhold enjoy excellent health." 
                  "Yes, sir," stuttered the servant. "I believe both are well." 
                  "Aha; you believe so. Come into my sanctum, please," as he led the way into a small but handsomely furnished library; "for I must trouble you with a reply for Mrs. Armhold. And Mr. Armhold is better-aha? He is?" he said, right abruptly. 
                  Jane felt peculiarly uneasy in the Rev. Doctor's presence. He was so sweet and honey-tongued, and still to her the tone in which he spoke was so repulsive. 
                  "Mr. Armhold is better, then?" he repeated, finding his first question unheeded. 
                  Jane gained courage and answered: 
                  "Yes, sir; much better, I believe." 
                  Rev. Dr. Broadwell, who had been writing something on a small sheet of paper, during the brief time this conversation had lasted, rose from his seat and approached Jane, who had not moved away from the sill of the door, saying: 
                  "Please give Mrs. Armhold my compliments, and hand her this note. Will you do so for me?" 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "Thank you." 
                  Jane left. Fifteen minutes later Hannah read the following: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "Mrs. ARMHOLD-Esteemed Madam: In reply to your note of this morning, permit me to name eleven o'clock as the most convenient hour to me, if no less suitable to you, to have the honor to hear your bidding. 
                              "Yours, with esteem, 
                              "C. BROADWELL, L. L. D." 
                            
                         
                     
                   
                
                
                  CHAPTER XII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              All other passions have their hour of thinking, 
                              And hear the voice of reason. This alone 
                              Breaks at the first suspicion into phrenzy, 
                              And sweeps the soul in tempests. 
                           
                         
                        FRANCIS'S "CONSTANTINE." 
                      
                   
                  THE Rev. Dr. Broadwell was punctual almost to a minute. At eleven o'clock precisely he arrived at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. Edgar Armhold. 
                  "Hand my card to your mistress," he said, very coolly and politely, to Jane, who had answered the bell. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold has instructed me to invite you into the drawing-room," replied the girl, "where she will join you instantly." 
                  With this the Rev. Dr. Broadwell suffered himself to be conducted into the drawing-room by the servant, who then ran up a flight of stairs, and informed her mistress of the arrival of the expected visitor. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell is down stairs," she said. 
                  Hannah did not reply. 
                  She only turned a little paler and became somewhat nervous, for her hands began to tremble. Now she arose from her seat, requested Jane to withdraw, then thoughtfully and with bowed head paced up and down the room for nearly a minute. "I'll tell him all," she whispered to herself, approached the door, stopped upon the sill for a moment, then resolutely, and with head haughtily held erect, swept down stairs. 
                   
                  "Mr. Broadwell," she commenced, in a low, clear voice, as she entered the drawing-room, and the Reverend Doctor, in a very easy and dignified manner, rose from his seat and advanced a step to salute her, "Mr. Broadwell, need I tell you that I am in trouble? I scarcely think it necessary: you can read it in my face. Pray, sit down." 
                  Both Hannah and Mr. Broadwell now took seats. 
                  "You are slightly paler than usual, Mrs. Armhold," said the minister, very calmly. "I trust, however, that nothing has occurred to disturb your peace of mind." 
                  "Mr. Broadwell, I am in trouble, else I should not have taken the liberty to solicit this interview," she said, almost in a whisper, for she was losing her equanimity. "When last we met in this room, I requested you not to repeat your visits to me, and to consider our acquaintance at an end. I have since discovered that I have done you great injustice-" 
                  "Pray pass this over, Mrs. Armhold," interrupted Mr. Broadwell, not in the least changing the expression of his placid countenance. "'Tis true it grieved me to have been so poorly understood by a lady whose wishes I esteemed so highly, and for whose salvation I prayed so often; but, as I believe in Christ Jesus, our Redeemer, I never bore you ill will for carrying out the wish of your husband-I trust you will pardon me for mentioning his name in this connection. I know 'twas he, having a different faith from ours, who prejudiced you against me. But how can I serve you, madam?" 
                  A silence of several minutes ensued before Hannah replied. When she did reply it was in a tremulous voice. 
                  "My husband has left me." 
                  'Twas all she could say. 'Twas more than she intended to say, but 'twas said, and she shrunk into herself as she heard her own confession. Her face turned blue and white alternately, gradually merging into a sickly green. Reverend Doctor Broadwell simply lowered his head as if moved to pity, while, in fact, he was smiling, for he had achieved, as he thought, two great conquests. Firstly, in the departure of Edgar Armhold, the mention of whose very name made his gall run over; and secondly, in the recovery of Mrs. Armhold's confidence, an event of the greatest importance to him. After waiting a moment or so, he raised his placid countenance and said, in a low and feeling voice: 
                  "Dear madam, I'm not worthy the confidence you are about to place in me. If it be your wish, however, I shall communicate whatever you desire to your esteemed parents. What weight can my advice have compared to that of your nearest kin?" Then, after a pause-"but if you will trust me with your sorrows-if you will confide in me-Mrs. Armhold, as I hope to enter heaven! no sacrifice I can make to render you happy shall be deemed too great. I speak sincerely, I speak truly, I speak from my heart." 
                  All this was said very sympathetically, but coolly and without the least fervor or passion. He mingled just enough sugar into the dose to make it palatable; he knew that more would have nauseated. 
                  Mrs. Armhold looked into her visitor's countenance, not as if she harbored the least distrust in his sincerity, but rather for the purpose of strengthening, by gazing at that placid brow, her own conviction of having done wisely in confiding her sorrows to the minister of her church. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," she said, looking as pale as death, "what shall I do? Mr. Armhold has left me last night." 
                  "Pray excuse me. How left you? Do you wish me to understand that he has deserted you?" inquired the Reverend Doctor. 
                  "I believe he has," and a tear forced itself into Hannah's eyes. Mr. Broadwell arose from his seat, and began slowly and thoughtfully to pace up and down the floor. 
                  "You believe he has," he commenced, stopping in the center of the room, and looking at Mrs. Armhold, who had by this time regained her composure, and wiped away a silent tear. "You believe he has-why do you believe it, madam? Pray, let me know." 
                  Hannah heaved a long sigh, turned somewhat paler than usual, and began to relate, without the least reserve, the life she and her husband had led for years, how they had become more and more estranged, and how she, continually thinking her husband only bent on subduing her, had determined and was still determined not to give way to him. She also told Mr. Broadwell the events of the preceding night, namely, all that was connected with Mr. Armhold's departure and the subsequent arrival of the mysterious stranger resembling him, and who had sought admittance at so unseasonable an hour. Mr. Broadwell, who had again taken his seat, was all attention, and suffered Hannah to finish her recital without the least interruption. "Yes," said she, in conclusion, "thus I am situated this morning, not knowing what to think, say, or do. I can not believe for a moment, that the stranger, who knocked at my door last night, was Mr. Armhold, and I can account still less for the resemblance that at once struck my servant's mind, impressing her with the belief that she saw her master's ghost, if it was not Mr. Armhold himself. I am perplexed, perplexed, Mr. Broadwell." So saying, she sadly nodded her head and lowered it over her bosom. 
                  "Had it been Mr. Armhold who had presented himself at your door," replied Mr. Broadwell, "your servant would not have taken him for a ghost. In saying that it only resembled him, and that she took it to be his ghost, is, in my humble opinion, evidence enough that she had borrowed the likeness rather from her over-wrought imagination, than from the strange visitor who had presented himself before her. If Mr. Armhold has taken his departure from this house, and even has forewarned you of it, then it was no idle threat of his, but a premeditated design too faithfully carried into effect." 
                  As Hannah heard this, she grew faint and sick at heart. She sighed and nodded, and nodded and sighed. 
                  "And you doubt not that he has gone away for good-that he has deserted me?" 
                  "Pardon me if I say, your husband has been contemplating such a movement ever since you determined not to accept his views in regard to religion. You know how great his antipathy is to the Christian Church. How could such a man love a Christian?-Mrs. Armhold, again I ask you to pardon me-he never loved you." 
                  Hannah was sensitive, very sensitive. This remark stung her to the quick, and she was determined to resent it. Her head, which had been lowered over her bosom, was now held erect, and her flashing eyes were reprovingly riveted on the still calm, countenance of the Reverend gentleman. 
                  Mr. Broadwell," she said, in a commanding tone, "you forget yourself-I tell you, you forget yourself." Thus giving vent to her excited feeling, she rose from her seat, and, tossing her head proudly aloft, haughtily paced up and down the full length of the drawing-room. Mr. Broadwell arose also. But he labored under no excitement. No, indeed-not he. He slowly walked toward the side-table upon which he had placed his hat, picked up the latter, and said, as calmly as if nothing unpleasant had occurred: 
                  "Mrs. Armhold, permit me to withdraw. I am too blunt to be mannerly, and too sincere to be agreeable. What you have so far confided in me shall be buried in my heart; shall never pass my lips." 
                  Hannah turned around, stopped in her walk, and gazed at Mr. Broadwell. But she could not read that calm face nor those eyes, which fully, but not openly, gazed into her own. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," she commenced, "Mr. Armhold did love me;" and she covered her face with her hands, and began to weep. 
                  Mr. Broadwell had gained his point. He had given her one home-thrust-it did not require more for the present. He suffered himself to be conciliated, and, therefore, acknowledged that he had been no less hasty than rude in giving his opinion. 
                  "A wife is a wife, whether deserted or not," she now said, wiping the tears from off her pale cheeks and eyes, "and is pained to hear such remarks, even from a friend, and you have made me believe that you are my friend." 
                  "Madam," he replied, slowly advancing to where she stood and gently taking hold of her hand, "can you even for a moment doubt my sincerity? Is not my whole life dedicated to the service of Jesus Christ our Redeemer, and is it not his especial command to his servants to heal the wounds of the afflicted in soul and body? And are you not sorely tried? O, sister," he continued now, raising his eyes heavenward, his voice growing tremulous with a well-affected fervency. "O, sister, trust me, I am your friend; let me bring the balm of Gilead to your soul, and restore the peace of Heaven to your mind. Let me fully understand your whole disease. Let me know your wants. Make me acquainted with your intentions, so I may correctly reflect over your situation, and, with the help of God, find myself able to show you the right path." 
                  He had gently taken up her hand, and now, as gently, he suffered it to slide through his own. The hat he had been holding in his left hand he now placed on the side-table, after which he once more seated himself. Hannah still remained standing in the center of the room, her head reclining over her bosom. The Reverend Doctor Broadwell watched her for several seconds silently, in order to give her time to digest what he had spoken. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," she said, after a pause, raising her calm, pale face, and wetting her dry lips with the tip of her tongue, "what shall I do?" 
                  This was uttered in a harsh, cold voice. Only angry, determined, or despairing persons speak in such a flinty, chopped voice. Hannah was a little of each, but most of the last. 
                  "Suffer me to study a moment," he replied, thoughtfully bending his head, and placing his index-finger against his lips. "Suffer me to study-to study-to study;" and he did study for one, two, three, yes-four minutes. At last he looked up: Hannah was no longer standing; she had also taken a seat, and was now pensively gazing at the man whom she had selected for her confidant. 
                  "Do you love your husband?" he asked, abruptly. 
                  There was terror in the calmness of his voice. 
                  Hannah shrunk into herself, and the red life-blood rushed into her face. She found no words to utter. He was still gazing at her, and she was gazing at him. He watched and kept silent until the blush had once more disappeared from her cheeks. Then he repeated: 
                  "Do you love your husband?" 
                  How calm and yet how torturing! It called for an unequivocal answer. Her lips trembled and her face grew paler. 
                  "I do." 
                  Once more the Rev. Dr. Broadwell became thoughtful, and nearly a minute expired before he raised his face again and said: 
                  "Does he love you?" 
                  This time Hannah was quick in replying. A proud but disdainful smile curled her thin lips, as she erected her head in dignity, replying in a clear, distinct voice: 
                  "He does." 
                  "You love him and he loves you," Mr. Broadwell whispered to himself thoughtfully; then rising from his seat slowly, with his hands behind him, he paced up and down the room. "And what are your intentions?" he said, somewhat louder, abruptly stopping and gazing at Hannah. 
                  She withdrew her eyes, and covered up her face. Mr. Broadwell heard her sob aloud. He did not like it, and, on a sudden, his whole face grew dark, and his eyes began to flash fire. A moment later, the emotion that had brought about this change was subdued, and he was again as calm as before. 
                  "What are your intentions?" he repeated, softly, but in a tone that, despite its softness, called for an unequivocal answer. 
                  "I don't know." 
                  "You don't know?" he repeated, then, finding her disinclined or unable to reply, again, with his hands behind him, thoughtfully, and in a straight line, paced up and down the room, muttering to himself, but half aloud, "you don't know-you don't know?" 
                  "Well, Mrs. Armhold," he said at length, stopping short in his walk, "you must have some intentions. Your husband, as you say, has deserted you. His absence will soon be discovered. Some plausible reason must be assigned for it. What step do you wish to take?" 
                  Hearing this, Hannah lost all control over herself. She succumbed entirely to her bitter feelings. She threw herself upon the nearest seat and moaned and sobbed as if her heart were breaking. 
                  "O, God! O, God!" she cried, wringing her hands and lifting her eyes heavenward. 
                  Rev. Dr. Broadwell, who stood but a short distance from her, watched her for a moment, and then advancing to where she sat, gently took hold of her hand, and, in a low and symoathetic voice, whispered: 
                  "Trust in God, sister, and all will yet be well. Your husband will return again, and as a supplicant for your pardon. Therefore, let us not despair, but think of measures, firstly, to allay suspicion, and secondly, to insure success to our efforts, without the least sacrifice of your dignity or honor." Then abruptly changing his voice and conversation,-"or don't you wish him to return?" 
                  A blush mantled Hannah's cheeks and her eyes searched the floor as she replied: 
                  "I love Mr. Armhold." 
                  "Then you are eager for his return?" 
                  "I am." 
                  "And if you were compelled to humble yourself before him and sue for his pardon." 
                  "O, don't torture me," she now broke forth in the great agony of her soul, and once more covered her face with her hands. "I have told you I love him. What more can I say? What more can I say?" 
                  Rev. Dr. Broadwell was not satisfied with this reply. He was determined that she should speak unequivocally. 
                  "And," he repeated, "if you had to humble yourself before him and sue upon your knees for his pardon-what then?" 
                  "He'll not want me to stoop," she sobbed. "I know he'll not want me to stoop." 
                  "But if he should?" persisted the Reverend Doctor. 
                  "I would." 
                  "But if he should love another more than yourself-what then?" 
                  "What then?" she shrieked, rising from her chair like an angry Goddess, her eyes flashing fire, "What then? can you ask me what then? My love should turn to hate, my prayers to curses, my nature to that of a hyena-what then? I should spurn him, and seek revenge as never woman yet has sought revenge!" 
                  These words were music to the Reverend Doctor's ears. He had discovered her tender point; found out where she was vulnerable; and he smiled in the full glory of his success. But that smile could not be seen on his calm, serene face; O, no; he had too much control over himself. That smile was born in his wicked heart, lived in his wicked heart, and warmed his wicked heart; but there was no visible change on his countenance, which was trained rather to conceal than to express feelings and emotions. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold," he commenced now, after he had calmly listened to her threat, "meekness is a Christian virtue, pleasing in the sight of God, and indispensably necessary in the walks of a successful life. Let me recommend to you-and by the great love I bear our Savior, I recommend it in the pure spirit of undying friendship-a greater control over your passions than you have just exhibited, and a feeling of conciliation in lieu of that of revenge. I do not know," he continued, in the same calm voice, "that you have the least cause for jealousy. Mr. Armhold has deserted you; believe me, madam, simply a difference in regard to your faiths would not have made him give up his own home. There must be another-a weightier reason for the bold step he has taken. Mr. Armhold-I confess it-is not the person to act in haste about any thing, and, least of all, in an affair of this nature. To leave home, wife, and child is no small matter; a sacrifice of this nature is made upon the weightiest of reasons. Now you were pleased to confess to me that you love Mr. Armhold, and that he loves you in return. I trust, dear madam, that you are not deceived in regard to his love for you. But what can be the cause of his abrupt departure? And you are sure that he loves you?" 
                  "I am," she said, proudly, approaching the window. 
                   
                  "Pardon me the question-how do you know it?" 
                  She haughtily turned around, gazed for a moment at the Reverend Doctor and replied: 
                  "Because I know it." 
                  Here Mr. Broadwell smiled, and this time the smiled seemed to rest now on his lips, now on his pale cheeks, and now in his eyes. You could not tell precisely what part of the face it most affected: it was so vague, one had to divine it-it could not be seen. "Because you know it," he repeated to himself, then, as once or twice before, with his hands behind him, and with his eyes directed toward the carpet, he began slowly to walk up and down the floor three or four times. After making the last round, he stopped in front of Hannah, raised his head and looked at her, saying in that cold, smooth, clear voice of his: 
                  "Because you know it-" 
                  "Yes, because I know it," she replied, most emphatically. Mr. Broadwell gave her another look, slightly-but very slightly-shrugged his left shoulder, then-recommenced his walk across that room. A silence of several minutes ensued, during which time the Reverend Doctor seemed to be reflecting, while Hannah, who was gazing at him now, was wondering and pondering over what the Reverend Doctor could be reflecting. 
                  "Do you doubt it?" she said, at last breaking the silence. 
                  "Doubt it?" he replied, stopping in his walk. "Doubt it? No, O no;" and again a slight shrug of that shoulder. Hannah's heart grew faint. She felt that the Doctor's words implied precisely the very opposite to what they expressed. 
                  "You do doubt it," she now said, with trembling lips, but, nevertheless, with firmness. 
                  "I doubt it?" he replied, in a half-questioning manner, without raising his eyes from the floor. "O no, I'm sure I did not say that I doubt it;" and he continued his slow walk across the room. 
                  "If you do not doubt it, why did you shrug your shoulder, and emphasize your words so as to belie their meaning? Mr. Broadwell! I have confided in you; you are a minister of the Holy Gospel, and you have promised to be a warm and faithful friend. Therefore be sincere with me. Do you doubt Mr. Armhold's love for me? If you do, let me assure you, that never loved a man a woman better than Mr. Armhold loves his wife! And even now I think he has not deserted me forever, but will return again." 
                  "Do you think Mr. Armhold capable of playing with the feelings of the wife he loves? Do you believe that he would stake his reputation simply to gratify some slight wish or notion of his? Answer me these questions, if you can." 
                  "No," Her thin white lips opened for this "No," and then they closed again. No other word escaped them. 
                  "No?" the Reverend Doctor now reechoed; "No? Then let me ask you why has he deserted you?" 
                  "Because-because;" and here she covered up her face and began to weep-" because I was too proud to show how much I loved him. He has asked me, repeatedly, upon his knees, whether he still had my love, and I, as repeatedly, not only refused to answer him this question, but left the impression upon his mind that I had lost all interest in him. And I believe for this sake he has deserted me and my little Emil." 
                  As she mentioned her little Emil, she began to moan and sob aloud. The Reverend Doctor was still the same. Whether she moaned, sobbed, proudly retorted, softly pleaded, or disdainfully replied, he was still cool, calm, and collected, controlling with an unusual skill the secret springs that regulated his passions. Discovering Hannah in tears, and sobbing, he now slowly approached her side, again took hold of her hand, and commenced, in a low, hope-infusing one: 
                  "Why weep? Pray, wipe away those tears and compose yourself. This thing is not so bad as it appears to you. No; 'twill all come right again. But not by weeping-no, no-not by weeping. If Mr. Armhold really loves you-and I have no doubt that he does-he will return. But you must not let his spies-" 
                  She would not let him complete this sentence. Though she had abused, neglected, and ill-treated her husband, still she would not suffer any person else to charge him with a low action, in her presence. So she raised her head with an offended dignity, saying: 
                  "What do you mean by 'spies'?" 
                  "Again I must ask you to excuse me. I simply desired to impress you with the necessity of keeping up appearances, for you may be watched where and when you least expect it. Would you gain your point-namely, make the return of your husband only a question of time-then you must observe a wariness in all your words and actions." 
                  Hannah heaved a long, deep sigh, shook her head in sadness, and began to weep again. 
                  "I can stand it no longer," she sobbed, and covered her face with her hands. 
                  "If you continue in this manner," replied Mr. Broadwell, "we shall come to no understanding. What good will weeping do you now?" 
                  "O God, O God!" she shrieked, "what have I done! What have I done! I never thought I should take it so hard. What will the world say of me when once his absence is discovered? O, my little Emil! my little Emil! 'tis your mother who has robbed you of your father. O God! O God! O God!" 
                  In this manner Hannah gave expression 
                      
                        RESCUED FROM THE FLAMES! 
                     
                     
                      to her misery, when Mr. Broadwell once more approached the table and picked up his hat, saying: 
                  "Mrs. Armhold, I am sorry that you force me to take my departure. You will not suffer me to help you out of your distress. You weep and weep, and moan and moan. It is impossible, under these circumstances, to come to any understanding." 
                  "O God! O God! do not leave me now; I should despair-I should despair," she sobbed, wringing her hands and lifting her face heavenward. 
                  "Then calm yourself, madam." 
                  Reverend Dr. Broadwell was once more persuaded to stay. Calmly his hat was laid aside, and as calmly he took his seat, 
                  "Now let us reason together," he said. "First of all, we must think of a plausible excuse to advance for the hasty departure of Mr. Armhold, and then-and then, having allayed suspicion, we shall take steps toward discovering his whereabouts, and then try to effect a lasting reconciliation between you." 
                  Hannah grew calmer. These words conveyed a ray of hope into her heart. 
                  "And do you think we can discover his whereabouts, and that he will return once more to his home, and forgive me?" she asked, full of anxiety. 
                  "Most assuredly, madam." 
                  Hannah was consoled. The drowning catch at a straw. Mr. Broadwell had said "most assuredly" in a most assuring manner, and she was consoled. 
                  "O, tell me what to do, that the cause of his departure may not be divined!" she pleaded. 
                  "Here we shall have to resort to a falsehood; but I trust," he continued, lifting his eyes heavenward, "I trust that our Redeemer will search our motives, and forgive us the sin." 
                  "What am I to do?" 
                  "Shakespeare says, 'False face must hide what the false heart both know.' This is applicable in your case, madam. You must conceal your sorrows, and wear a smile upon your countenance. And if you are asked whither your husband went, answer in your usual tone of voice that he went to New York on business with his publishers; and if asked how long he would stay, then reply, with the same indifference, that he would be gone a month or more. In this manner you will allay suspicion, and gain ample time for further action." 
                  Hannah heaved a sigh. 
                  "I'll try to appear joyful," she said, and tears filled her eyes. 
                  "That's spoken to the purpose, madam," Mr. Broadwell replied. 
                  "Shall I give the same excuse to my parents, to my brother, as I do to others?" she inquired, in a faint voice. 
                  "To one and all alike, Mrs. Armhold." 
                  "I have never yet uttered a falsehood to my parents," she said, while tears streamed down her cheeks. 
                  "Again weeping?" 
                  "O God! how can I help it? Is not my heart almost breaking? You do not know how I feel! You can not know! My heart! my heart! O, my heart!" 
                  She rose from her chair, placed her hands against her breast, and, heaving a long sigh, hurried, in short but quick steps, up and down the room. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold," said Mr. Broadwell now, "ease your mind of this trouble. I shall not cease my labors until I know your husband fully reconciled to you. All I require of you is secrecy, even toward your parents, and a faithful observance of my instructions. Heed both these admonitions, madam, and in less than two weeks' time I shall have the pleasure and gratification of having successfully served you." 
                  "I hope to God that it will end that well." 
                  "Fear not, madam. Keep up your spirits, for there is no cause for grief. I tell you, Mrs. Armhold," he now added, with more boldness, seeing her considerably composed, "I tell you there is more cause for anger than there is for grief. I can not see in what you should have so much offended your husband. You have not told him that you loved him. Well, and if you have not: should he on this account not only have left you, but also his own son? Mrs. Armhold, he has not gone away-he has not left his son. The more I think on't, the more I feel assured of this. I am persuaded to agree with you. I do believe, now, that this temporary absence is designed to subdue and humble you. He knows, despite your opinion to the contrary, that you love him; and now, cool and calculating as he is, he intends to teach you a lesson that you will not soon forget. He plays a dangerous, but a skillful game. Mrs. Armhold, you will hear of your husband before long, if not directly-indirectly." 
                  "And do you believe him capable of thus playing with my feelings?" 
                  "During the course of this interview, madam, I have asked you precisely the same question, when you were pleased to answer me in the negative, namely, that you did not think Mr. Armhold capable of playing with the feelings of the wife he loves. Now you ask me that question, as if your conviction of the truth of your own assertion had, by some means, become shaken. In answer to your query, permit me to say that Mr. Armhold, if he loves you, will not play with your feelings; but if he does not-" 
                  "But he does," she interrupted, the blood rushing to her face. 
                  "If he does love you," coolly remarked Mr. Broadwell, "why, then, he will return." 
                  "I do not understand you, Mr. Broadwell; indeed, I do not understand you," Hannah responded, shaking her head in sadness. "You seem to contradict yourself in every alternate remark. O God! O God! what will become of me?" and again she began to weep. 
                  "I must confess that I do not understand your husband's conduct. I think he loves you, and then again I think he does not love you. At all events, in less than twenty-four hours I shall be out of this dilemma. Therefore, let us be patient that long, and await the results." 
                  "What results?" 
                  "The results of our patience." 
                  "How very unsatisfactory!" Hannah exclaimed, heaving a long sigh. 
                  "Not at all, madam. Rest assured, something must turn up within two days. In the mean time, inform those who ask, in as nonchalant a manner as you can, that Mr. Armhold has gone to New York on business." 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," she now said, "I will follow your advice, for you are a servant of our Lord, and I know you will stand by me in this hour of my great trial." 
                  "Aye, unto death, dear madam," he replied, raising his eyes toward the window, and sanctimoniously looked toward the sky beyond. 
                  Just then the house-bell rung. As Hannah heard the sound, she became embarrassed, retired some distance, took a seat at the further end of the room, and waited there for the appearance of the servant. No sooner had the latter come opposite the parlor-door than she called her to her side, saying: 
                  "Jane, hurry up stairs, and see who's at the door." 
                  Jane understood her mistress, and ran up stairs. Two minutes later she was back again. Her lips were quivering, and her cheeks were pale. 
                  "What's the matter?" asked Hannah, who had observed the change in her servant's expression. 
                  "Please," she stammered. "I want to tell you something." And she eyed Mr. Broadwell as if she had something to report that was not for his ears. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell will please excuse me for a moment," said Hannah, and retired with her servant into the hall. No sooner were they alone than Jane, growing more and more agitated, said, half aloud, as if afraid of her own voice: 
                  "He is out there again!" 
                  "Who?" 
                  "The stranger." 
                  "What stranger?" 
                  "The stranger who was at the door last night, and who looks so very much like Mr. Armhold." 
                  Hannah turned as pale as ashes, and once more grew faint at heart. 
                  The bell rung again. 
                  "Wait a moment, Jane," she said, hastening into the drawing-room, and communicated the fact to Mr. Broadwell; then, a moment later, she returned to her servant and told her to answer the call. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              None have accused thee; 'tis thy conscience cries, 
                              The witness in the soul that never dies; 
                              Its accusation, like the moaning wind 
                              Of wintry midnight, moves the startled mind; 
                              O, may it melt thy hardened heart, and bring 
                              From out thy frozen soul the life of spring. 
                           
                         
                        MRS. HALE. 
                      
                   
                  AFTER Hannah had dispatched her faithful servant to the door to answer the bell, she once more returned to her visitor in the drawing-room, who, judging by his appearance, had to some extent, by the information he had just gained, lost his equanimity. Hannah herself seemed embarrassed, and, as she approached Mr. Broadwell, the features of her face underwent a change. Her pale cheeks, as well as her thin lips, began to exhibit a peculiar restlessness. She was faint at heart, one could see, and once or twice she suffered a sigh to escape. Uneasily, and in irregular paces, she crossed the room; at last she approached the reverend doctor, with her eyes fully riveted upon his countenance. 
                  "Who can this visitor be?" she whispered in a tone of uneasiness. "I don't know why I feel so sick at heart. It seems as if some heavy calamity were threatening me and mine. Can I-can I trust in you, Mr. Broadwell?" 
                  The gentleman thus addressed was about to answer, when Jane reentered the drawing-room, and, approaching her mistress, placed in her hands a card, saying: 
                  "The stranger requested me, in the absence of Mr. Armhold, to present this to his wife." 
                  Hannah suffered her eyes to rest for a moment, and only for a moment, upon the small card, which she tremblingly took between her fingers, then staggered back a pace, and, in a stifled voice, exclaimed: 
                  "REUBEN ARMHOLD!" 
                  The reverend doctor slowly rose from his seat, picked up his hat, and, turning toward the door, remarked, with that coolness characteristic of his nature: 
                  "Mrs. Armhold, I do not think it advisable to remain and witness an interview between yourself and the person who must evidently-judging by the name-be a relative of-" 
                  Hannah did not suffer him to finish his remark. 
                  "Relative!" she exclaimed: "he is no less a person than my husband's brother. O God, O God! what can he want with me? He has been absent for a number of years, and, until now, I knew not of his arrival in the city. How can I meet him, and what can I say to him?" 
                  Once more the sound of the bell vibrated through the hall. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," continued Hannah, "what-what shall I do?" 
                  Mr. Broadwell, who, with hat in hand, and with eyes vaguely resting upon that hat, was still standing at the door, now retraced his steps, and after looking at the card which Hannah had dropped from her trembling fingers, and which he had picked up from the rich Tyrian carpet, repeated, slowly and thoughtfully, as if a new idea had struck his mind, the name of "Reuben Armhold." 
                  "Shall I admit him?" said Jane, looking at her mistress. 
                  "Not yet," replied the wily minister, taking it upon himself to answer for the mistress of the house. Then turning toward Mrs. Armhold, he said, while a faint smile rested on the curves of his lips: 
                  "You have nothing to fear, dear madam. Rest assured that your husbands brother knows of your husband's whereabouts, and comes on a mission which can not but prove advantageous to you, if you do not show that weakness to him which you have shown to me. I shall retire, and leave you with him. Show him, in words and in actions, if he should broach-which he certainly will do-the subject which we have been discussing-which must, I think, be the cause of his present visit-that it is you who have been grievously injured. Make him understand, in unequivocal terms, that you do not consider the conduct of your husband as that of a gentleman, and that it will not likely bring about the result he hoped for. Yes, show him that you are fully determined upon your rights as a wife, and your dignity as a woman; that you fear not his threats, nor care-so long as your conscience says you are right-for what the world may speak or think on this matter. Impress this upon the mind of this Mr. Reuben Armhold, and when he leaves you he will be under the conviction that he has to deal with a lady whose feelings can not be tampered with. Now I will depart, for my presence, I am confident, would only embarrass this conference. I shall, however, if you desire it, take the liberty of calling on you during the day, in order to become acquainted with the result of this meeting. Hence, take courage, dear madam; for your husband, in sending his brother to advocate his cause, has shown a weakness I did not think him guilty of. You may instruct your servant to admit the gentleman." 
                  "And will you leave me alone with him?" asked Hannah, at the same time nodding to Jane to admit the visitor. 
                  "It is best, dear madam." 
                  "And if my husband's brother should ask, or if it should be necessary to inform him, who the person was that had just left me, shall I tell him?" 
                  "You may; in fact, it will show him, if he has heard the history of your husband, that his conduct has not in the least frightened you, and that you still receive the visits of the regularly ordained minister of your church." 
                  The servant by this time had opened the door, and invited the stranger, who had been kept impatiently waiting, into the drawing-room, where her mistress intended to receive him, when he, as he advanced into the hall, was confronted by Rev. Dr. Broadwell, who had just left the presence of Mrs. Armhold. These two gentlemen-Broadwell calm and collected, with a face clear and unruffled as the sky of a summer's eve; the other equally as calm, but with a firmness and a determination carved in the lineaments of his story countenance-raised their eyes, and for a moment kept them riveted upon each other. What it was that made them stop and gaze upon each other with such unusual intensity, and change color, is not our present task to relate. Suffice it to say, that strange thoughts, at least in the mind of Mr. Reuben Armhold, were awakened by this unexpected meeting-thoughts which unfolded the vista of the past, and exhibited to his mental eye a panorama with a leaden sky. 
                  They gazed upon one another only for a moment; then Rev. Dr. Broadwell, with a bow no less deferential than graceful, passed along, and the new-comer, followed by Jane, passed into the drawing-room. Hannah, who had thrown herself upon a divan, and was languidly leaning upon her arm, feigning to be reading a small volume which she had taken in her hand, arose as the servant announced the visitor, and, advancing a step, said, in a low, distinct voice: 
                  "Mr. Armhold!" 
                  Reuben, in a voice far more clear and metallic, and with equally as much dignity as that displayed on the countenance of his haughty sister-in-law, advanced toward the center of the room, and, after taking a hasty glance at the statue-like woman before him, inquired whether he could see her husband. Hannah, laboring under the impression that Reuben was aware of his brother's absence, and was now simply feigning ignorance, did not invite him to take a seat, but, by suffering him to stand before her, wished to convey to him the idea that she knew of his mission, and deemed him not worthy of her respect. This cold reception, however, Reuben attributed to another cause. He did not, for a moment, think that he was looked upon by the wife of his brother as the agent of that brother. How could he? He was not even aware of Edgar's departure, no more than of the subject of the conference that had been held between Rev. Dr. Broadwell and Hannah. When she, therefore, informed formed him that her husband was absent, and had not as much as expressed astonishment at his (Reuben's) return to the city, he could not help thinking that his card had not been delivered, or, if delivered, had not been carefully read. It was true that after he had entered, he was under the impression that she had addressed him by his proper name; but now, as he reflected upon her conduct, he began to doubt whether he had heard aright. Reading in her looks that she was disinclined to prolong the meeting, he found himself necessitated, in order to satisfy himself of the cause of his cold reception, to introduce himself again. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold," he said, "I regret exceedingly the absence of your husband, my brother. I arrived in the city but yesterday, and made bold to have myself announced to you at a late hour last night. Your servant on perceiving me, without answering me whether your husband was at home or not, closed the door in my face and retired, frightened, I presume, at my appearance. I returned to my hotel with the intention of calling upon my brother this morning. I am here, but he is absent, and in his stead I am received by his wife, with a strangeness which even exceeds that of her servant. Madam, I have no right to ask you for the cause of this conduct, and, therefore, simply beg to be informed of my brother's address, and when you expect his return." 
                  Hannah, who had calmly listened to Reuben's remarks, now faltered in the path she intended to pursue; for the impression that he had come from his brother, and as his brother's agent, was, if not totally dispelled, shaken to a great extent. She was, therefore, at a loss how to proceed. A cold reception-colder than she would have given had she not labored under that impression-Reuben had received at her hands. How to rectify her error without betraying herself to him, was a task for her, unskilled as she was in the art of deception, not easily performed. Reuben had scarcely finished his remarks, when she directed her glance, which was a subdued one, on his icy, motionless, determined features, and trembled, inwardly trembled, as he returned that glance, which, in its steadiness, seemed to pierce her heart and read its innermost secrets. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she said, advancing a step, "I sincerely regret the absence of my husband, who would only have been too happy to meet again his brother after a separation of so many years. Be seated, sir." 
                  Reuben, however, who had perceived the unaccountable embarrassment of his sister-in-law, did not take a seat. He remained standing in the center of the drawing-room, exhibiting a calmness in his features and an unstudied grace in his manly deportment, which she, from what she had heard of his character, did not expect to find. After she had invited him to a seat, he paused a second, and said: 
                  "Thank you, madam. My brother being absent, I shall take my leave without further troubling you. If you would be but kind enough to give me his address, I should be under many obligations to you." 
                  Hannah felt that her courage was forsaking her. She was unequal to the task before her. How could she play the part of a hypocrite? While the Reverend Doctor Broadwell had been with her, she had made herself believe that she would be capable to act deceptively; but now, now, in the presence of her husband's brother-in the presence of a being whose steady glance seemed to be reading-as she thought, in her very looks-her innermost secrets-she discovered that she had not known herself. She felt that she could not successfully carry out the instructions she had received. 
                  "My husband did not leave me his address when he left," she said, scarcely able to look Reuben in the face, who was not slow to perceive it. Reuben had learned much during the last five years; and during his hard school of probation, the study of human nature had received his greatest attention. That his sister-in-law was momentarily becoming more and more embarrassed, did not escape his eyes, which, now and then, scanned her grave countenance. 
                  "Being Edgar's brother," he said, "I trust you will not think it rude in me to ask you when he left the city and whither he went?" 
                  Now Hannah's cheeks, which had been pale before, turned red, but soon the blood rushed back to her heart, and her face was again-ashen hued. There was no way of getting rid of that question. It had to be answered-it had to be met. She imagined to see Mr. Broadwell standing before her-the minister of her church-whispering into her ears not to falter in carrying out his instructions. What should she do? Follow her friend's advice? Yes, yes, she would, and with this thought she raised her head and turned her eyes-proud and cold-toward Reuben, who still stood at the same place-an adamantine figure with an adamantine face. Her lips no longer quivered, but were growing sharp in their curves, as they were about to give utterance to a falsehood. But they did not give utterance to it. No! Not a sound escaped them. As she now gazed upon that open face, her heart sickened and quailed within her bosom. Again she lowered her head over her fastly-heaving bosom, for she could not stand that steady look of his. She could not play a part; she had tried to carry out her instructions, but in the very act of performing that duty, had discovered the impossibility for HANNAH to act otherwise than HANNAH! Her head, as stated before, was lowered over her bosom. She grew pensive, and was thinking-thinking only for a moment-then she erected herself self with that dignity natural to the lofty, and, after meeting Reuben's eyes once more, but this time with a glance that spoke of conscious worth and injured pride, said, in a voice no less distinct than clear: 
                  "What do you think of me?" 
                  Reuben was surprised. This question he did not anticipate. He would have smiled (though he had not been seen to smile for years), had not her steady, sober and thoughtful look warned him from it. "What do you think of me?" What a question! And how abruptly it had been put! If Hannah had been embarrassed before, Reuben was embarrassed now. Not that he had no control over himself-no, it was not that. It was rather her quick transition from a show of undisguised fear and anxiety to a display of unmistakable boldness, that so much astonished him. He could not refrain from looking at her as she stood there, not as much as changing a single muscle in her grave, thoughtful face. She inspired him with a peculiar kind of respect-of awe. He had been in her presence but a few minutes, but they had been sufficient to convince him that his sister-in-law was no ordinary personage. 
                  "Madam," he said, "having the pleasure of seeing my brother's wife for the first time, I can not but think this question-so vaguely expressed-to say the least, a strange one." 
                  Hannah eyed him for some time before she spoke. She seemed to be studying his character. 
                  "Sit down." 
                  Reuben seated himself upon the chair nearest him. Hannah sat down on the divan. 
                  "You think this question a strange one-do you?" she repeated, her fingers playing with the folds of her dress. 
                  "Under the circumstances-yes." 
                  "Mr. Armhold-your brother, my husband is not here." 
                  
                     Now her eyes were searching the floor, and her tiny, jeweled fingers continued to play with the folds of her dress. 
                  "You have told me so," replied Reuben, watching her attentively. 
                  "He is not in the city." 
                  Still looking at the floor. 
                  "I regret it much. I have not seen my brother for years, and he being the only relative I have left me now, I, naturally, yearn once more to embrace him." 
                  A tear forced itself into Hannah's eye, but Reuben did not perceive it. 
                  "He has deserted me," she said now, and covering up her face with her hands, fairly succumbed to her emotions, and sobbed aloud. 
                  Was Reuben moved to pity by it? No. His nature, like his looks, had become hardened, and a kind of indifference to the misery of others had, during his five years' confinement in Sing Sing, taken control of his soul. He had lost there that feeling of tenderness which formerly, like a mellow light, had conspieuously shone forth amid the darker passion of his impetuous nature. The fountain of pity had become dried up, and his heart, like his face, was a cold lifeless blank. He had also lost his impetuosity, and grown firmer, harder-immovable. Nothing could disturb his equanimity, else the sight of the Reverend Doctor Broadwell would have accomplished that result. Five years' imprisonment had made him master over himself; five years' imprisonment fitted him to master others. 
                  Hannah wept-wept aloud; Reuben looked at her unmoved. What cared be if she did weep? Had he not heard enough, through Mr. Montgomery, of her ill-treatment toward Edgar? And yet, he felt no malicious gratification at her misery. Meanness was not part of his composition. Though his heart had grown hard as granite, it had also a color as clear. 
                  "He has deserted you, madam-" he said, in a cold, clear, monotonous tone. "Wherefore?" 
                  
                     Wherefore? Hannah raised her head and as she did so, the tears seemed to freeze in her eyes. Wherefore? Her haughty nature brooked no questioning. It made her angry; it wounded her pride to be interrogated. 
                  "What right have you to inquire into my affairs?" she answered, her eyes flashing fire. 
                  "None, madam!" 
                  
                     His eyes did not flash fire, nor betrayed his low, sepulchral tone the least anger. He simply gazed at her, dispassionately and patiently waiting for her reply. 
                  The secret was out. There was no way of turning back. The Reverend Doctor Broadwell's instructions had been disregarded and the truth had been spoken. She had confessed that her husband had deserted her, and though the confession had cost her a mighty effort and had almost completely broken her heart, yet no sooner had Reuben interrogated her as to the reasons for this, his brother's conduct, than Hannah, strengthened by the unburdening of her own soul, had once more grown calm and regained her equanimity. But when he, to her question. "What right have you to inquire into my affairs?" coolly and without the least anger, simply remarked, "None, Madam," a kind of fear took possession of her, and made her timid. 
                  HANNAH ARMHOLD-timid. 
                  Never before had she had such feelings. She felt like a child, conscious of a wrong, confronted by a stern parent, who had the power but not the will to chastise. She looked upon his face with an undefinable apprehension-upon that face that was too calm to be austere and too hard to be grave. Her eyes no longer flashed fire, and that feeling of injured pride had subsided. But he-that man who sat there as cool and collected as if the most ordinary subjects had been discussed -was still keeping his eyes on her and was waiting for an answer: for her to say something, and, judging by his appearance, caring little for what that something would be. 
                  "Your brother has done me wrong, sir," she said, attempting to assume the boldness of offended dignity. "A man to desert his wife-to desert his child-" this she uttered with considerable stress-"to desert his child is unworthy of a single tear." Now she rose from her seat, and, after taking a step forward, retraced that step and sat down again. She picked up the book that was still lying on the divan, and suffered her eyes to glance over it for a moment. While still thus engaged, she continued: "Your brother is mistaken if he thinks that his wife will grieve over his departure." 
                  If it had been possible for Reuben's face to become more hard and flinty, this remark would have brought about this change. 
                  "I presume my brother is fully satisfied that his leaving house and home is rather a relief than aught else to his wife." 
                  This touched her to the quick. Was it possible that Broadwell was right, she thought, and that Reuben was an agent from his brother, come now in his behalf to sound her to the lowest key? 
                  "You are aware of my husband's absence?" 
                  "Madam, if I had been aware of it, I should not have called upon you this morning." 
                  "By what do you judge, then, Mr. Armhold's absence a relief to me?" 
                  "A woman who loves and respects not the husband to whom she is wedded, must feel relieved by his absence." 
                  "Who told you that I do not respect him?" she said sharply. 
                  "Your own assertions, madam. The wife who can inform her husband's brother, in as cool a language as you have done, that his deserting her does not make her grieve, neither loves nor respects that husband." 
                  Hannah felt the truth of this remark, and cowed beneath its weight. 
                  "If Mr. Armhold had had the least feeling, he would not have acted as he did." 
                  "By what I can hear, and by what I still remember," replied Reuben, "of my brother's disposition, I am led to believe-aye, I am convinced-that he could never have wronged you." 
                  "By what you can hear?" Hannah repeated, in astonishment. 
                  "By what I can hear," was the cool reply. 
                  "Then, since your return, your brother has already been the theme of your conversation with others?" 
                  "Yes, madam." 
                  Now a pause of several minutes ensued. Hannah was the first to break it. 
                  "Mr. Armhold is highly honored in the city," she said. "I presume you have heard it?" 
                  "He receives but his deserts." Then abruptly-"Did you have any intimation of my brother's departure?" 
                  "He has once dared to threaten me with it." 
                  "He has?" Reuben repeated, not in the least agitated or angry. "Had my brother any cause to leave you?" 
                  "No!-But what is that to you?" 
                  "You are right-nothing, madam." 
                  "So saying, he slowly rose from his seat and moved toward the door. Before he had gone half ways, however, Hannah called him back. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she said, laboring under the greatest of excitement, "your brother is a feelingless wretch-" 
                  Reuben turned around and faced his sister-in-law. His lips were more compressed, and the white of his face was turning a kind of green, but that was all. A moment later a faint smile was on his cheeks. His eyes began to glisten as with inward joy. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold," he said, advancing a step, "I regret-sincerely regret this state of affairs! My brother must have acted hastily, when he took this step. I hope he will repent it, and return again." 
                  "For my part he may stay away forever." 
                  "No, no, madam," he continued, the selfsame smile upon his lips, "you must forgive him. Edgar has wronged you, I admit it, but you must forget it, yes, forget it." 
                  Hannah misunderstood this change in the tone of Reuben's remarks. In the same proportion as he gave way and softened down, she became more haughty and less reconcilable. Had she, however, been able to look into his heart and read the motives of this change, she would have shrunk back in horror as from the awful presence of Satan himself. 
                  "But I shall not forgive him. No! Mr. Edgar Armhold can not subdue the spirit of his wife, nor humble her to his slave," she said now, full of animation. "I shall have my own way, and not suffer him to control my very action. I'll show him that I care little for his threats-little for his leaving me, and less for his emissaries. I can do very well without him." 
                  Hannah rose from her seat and advanced toward the window. Her gait was graceful and elastic, and her bearing that of a queen. She had given vent to her feelings and expressed her opinion without the least reserve. She was satisfied, and imagined to have come off conqueror in this affair. 
                  "Are you certain that my brother has left his home with the intention of never returning unto it again? I can scarcely believe it. When did he leave, Madam?" 
                  "Last night." 
                  "He will return again, most assuredly." 
                  
                     He will return again, most assuredly!
                   
                  Hannah heard this remark while she was looking through the window with an abstract air. Now she withheld that gaze, so to say, and turned it inward. Had she understood him? Yes. Reuben, his own brother, had said that Edgar would most assuredly return. How came he to think so? That was the question Hannah now pondered over. She became very grave and thoughtful. At last a smile faintly played upon her lips, but soon a sneer replaced it, and disdain was written on and in ever line of her face. Yes, how came he to think so? 
                  A new idea flashed across her mind. She was no longer in doubt; in fact, she was convinced. 
                  Reuben Armhold was deceiving her. He knew (so thought Hannah) of his brother's absence, and had come simply to negotiate for terms of peace. Hannah was so positive of this, that she could scarcely refrain from giving expression to her conviction. As remarked, she had been vaguely staring through the window. Now she turned around and faced whom she supposed to be Edgar's accredited agent. She raised her head aloft, so that she might look down upon him from a greater distance. The respect his calm demeanor had gained from her was lost. She viewed him now in the light of a callous tool, void of honor, principle, and dignity. 
                  "To tell you the truth," she said in a clear, bell-like voice, "I care little for my husband's return. In fact, I should prefer his staying away-since he is away-rather than to be compelled constantly to see him about me. He might, otherwise, entertain the opinion that I still loved or cared for him." 
                  "Then you do not care for him?" 
                  "No!" A moment later-"You may inform him of it if you like." 
                  "Pray, tell me what wrong has he done unto you?" 
                  "None, except that he can't command my love. Is that not enough?" 
                  "It is, madam. I thought, however, that the person whose conduct challenges the admiration of so many, would find it not difficult to command the love and respect of his wife. And does Edgar know, madam," he continued, "your sentiments in regard to him?" 
                  "Why not? I told him so." 
                  "But my brother loves you?" 
                  "I don't know, and I don't care." 
                  "You must have led a very unhappy life together?" said Reuben. 
                  "No, not at all. I did as I pleased, and troubled myself very little about him." 
                  "I understood that he has been an invalid for some time?" 
                  "He appeared not to enjoy the best of health." 
                  "He appeared not to enjoy the best of health?" repeated Reuben, and as he did so his lips seemed to quiver slightly. "And do you feel no anxiety for him? None, madam? Recollect! he is your husband and your child's father." 
                  Hannah did not answer. She took a seat once more, lowered her head over her bosom, and struggled to keep the tears from rushing to her eyes. She had still some kind feelings for the man who had won her first love, though she scarcely acknowledged it to herself. Reuben had reminded her of Edgar's illness, and now she imagined to see his emaciated form slowly winding its way through the shaded paths in the garden, as she had so often seen it from her own window. At this moment she would have succumbed to her emotions, and probably have fallen upon her knees before Reuben to have pity on her, had not the thought that she was in the presence of her husband's agent, the thought instilled by Broadwell, sustained her in the part she was playing. 
                  "Does any one else know of my brother's departure?" said Reuben, after a short pause. 
                  Hannah raised her face; it was pale, but not haughty, and misery was written in every line. 
                  "A servant of mine, and the gentleman who has just left me as you were announced know of his departure." 
                  Again a vague, faint smile passed over the features of Reuben's placid countenance. Hannah, however, saw it not, for she had averted his gaze and was absent-mindedly looking at the frescoed ceiling overhead. 
                  "Is that gentleman who has just left you a friend of your family?" Reuben asked, in a nonchalant manner. 
                  "Yes, sir," she replied, in a tone scarcely audible. 
                  "How came he to know so soon of my brother's absence?" 
                  "By my telling him of it." 
                  "His name, madam?" 
                  Again this interrogation-and that by a comparative stranger of so doubtful a character! She could not, could not-would not stand it. Her nature was once so-she could not change it. 
                  "Had I been inclined to tell his name, I should have done so without being asked," she replied, rather sharply. Reuben kept cool. Never appeared a man more phlegmatic. Nothing could arouse his temper-even not this insult. 
                  "Excuse me, madam," he said; "he being as you stated, a friend of my brother, I had the boldness to inquire of you his name." 
                  "He is not a friend of your brother, or rather your brother is not his friend. Mr. Armhold always had a prejudice against him-had even forbidden me to receive his visits." 
                  "Which request of his you-" 
                  She did not let him finish the sentence. She finished it herself by adding the word "disregarded." After which she continued: "Was it not bad enough to be married to a Jew, without having him to deprive me of the company of a class of people who are above his own as much as this gentleman's character is above that of my husband." 
                  She was agitated, and rose from her seat. She began to pace the floor. Reuben still sat there, even in the very same position he had taken when he first seated himself. His face was a shade paler, that was all. 
                  "I knew not that my brother was prejudiced against Christians. Judging by his writings, I should have taken him to be a cosmopolitan in the broadest sense of the word. And a person whose views as to religion are as liberal as those of my brother, would certainly raise no objection to his wife's associating with Christians, simply because they were Christians. If he disliked them as a sect, he would not have married you, madam." 
                  "I am sorry that he ever did become my husband." 
                  "Madam, such language will not raise you in the estimation of any man; and, least of all, in the estimation of your husband's brother." 
                  "To praise Edgar Armhold would but lower Hannah Preston!" 
                  Reuben turned green, and again a slight tremor shook his frame. But he suppressed his bitter, bitter feelings, and remained calm. 
                  "Then you can not give me my brother's address?" he inquired. 
                  "No!" 
                  Now he arose and was about to leave. Hannah saw his intention, and felt uneasy, but knew not why. 
                  "I am of the opinion your brother is still in the city," she remarked, while looking through the window. 
                  "If he is in the city still, and I should find him, what shall I say to him?" 
                  "Any thing you like." 
                  She was still standing before the window, and absent-mindedly writing figures on its panes. 
                  "If he should ask me whether I have seen his wife, and how she bore this affliction-" 
                  "Affliction!" she exclaimed, turning around, and with a mocking defiance looking at the calm face of Reuben. "Affliction! Mr. Armhold, let me inform you that your brother's absence has had the opposite effect on me. I feel considerably relieved by it. I do, I do." 
                  Again she paced the floor, but soon returned to the window, with her back toward her visitor. Tears were in her eyes. She was angry at Edgar, at his brother, and--at herself. 
                  "Then you don't wish him to return?" inquired Reuben. 
                  "No! How many times am I to repeat this 'No.'" 
                  "But he is an invalid and may die?" 
                  "He will not die." 
                  "But if you should, how could you ever be happy again?" 
                  "Not having contributed to his death, I know not why it should affect me more than any one else, and make me miserable." 
                  "Remember, I am his brother, madam, and, therefore, ask you to be more generous toward your husband. May I tell Edgar that his wife feels aggrieved at his conduct, but his willing to forgive and forget, if he but return again unto his house and home?" 
                  "If Edgar wishes to return he can do so, but I shall never beg him-let him never hope for it." 
                  "Be more generous, madam." 
                  "He deserves my contempt, and nothing else." 
                  "Be more generous," Reuben repeated for the second time, advancing toward the door. "Let him return, so he may end his days at home. You know him an invalid-give him your love and care, and yield him obedience." 
                  A pause after this, then Hannah- 
                  "Mr. Armhold, let us terminate this interview, which can not but be painful to both of us. My husband has once decided upon this step, should you meet him, of which I have not the least doubt, you may tell him that his wife would sooner die than ask him to return." 
                  Reuben raised himself up to his natural hight, and, with lips compressed, and eyes flashing fire, gazed on the haughty figure before him. 
                  "You may regret these words," he said. 
                  "And what is that to you?" 
                  "Nothing, and yet something. Retract what you have said." 
                  "Leave me!" 
                  "My name is REUBEN ARMHOLD!" 
                  "Leave me!" 
                  "Remember, if my brother dies, his blood shall be on your head." 
                  "Leave me, sir!" 
                  "When next we meet, it will be on your knees." 
                  "Leave me!" she thundered. 
                  He retired. No sooner was he gone than Hannah, no longer able to restrain her feelings, threw herself upon the floor, and shed a flood of tears. 
                  And where was Broadwell, and what was he doing? 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XIV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              As lamps burn silent, with unconcious light, 
                              So modest ease in beauty shines most bright; 
                              Unaiming charms with edge restless fall, 
                              And she who means no mischief, does it all. 
                           
                         
                        A. HILL. 
                      
                   
                  REVEREND DOCTOR BROADWELL was on Clifton Avenue, at the mansion of the Harringtons, seated in the drawing room, alongside of Miss Carrie. He was speaking to her in an undertone, and she was calmly and very attentively listening. Her head was lowered, and reclined on her left arm that rested on her knee. Her right hand was playfully busy in arranging the folds of her dress. Once or twice, in the course of his narration, she exhibited a kind of restlessness as if moved or startled by what he was communicating, but otherwise she remained quiet until he, being entirely through with his recital, fell back upon his seat, and became silent also. 
                  Now she raised her head and heaved a sigh. He drew from his vest pocket a small golden tooth-pick and began to play with it. In this manner, a strict silence observed by each, minute after minute passed away. Another sigh, and Carrie rose from her seat. As she stood erect, she seemed to have grown taller by several inches. She was attired in a dark dress of maroon merino, without the least trimming. Wore no apron, no belt, no collar-nothing that could be called ornamental. She stood there in her plain dark gown, more like a matron than a girl. 
                  "You are avenged, Carrie," commenced Broadwell, in a low tone. 
                  Carrie said nothing in reply. She simply looked at the speaker for a second, then slowly passed across the room, stationed herself before a beautiful, large-sized French mirror, and thoughtfully looked at her own reflection. 
                  What a change! where were those dimpled rosy cheeks? Those cherry lips? Those laughing eyes? Where were they now? 
                  Her face was still white but rather of a sickly hue. Her eyes-her once laughing blue eyes, no longer laughed, no, indeed. They reminded you of a chastened spirit, now and then able to grow rebellious, drooping and brooding in them. Her lips were of a bluish white, but her teeth were still beautiful, and with their crystal color and regularity gave a peculiar vaguish charm to her features. Her form had grown somewhat more slender, but had lost nothing of its native grace and voluptuousness. As she now gazed upon herself a tear forced itself into her eyes, and her whole countenance assumed a despondent, sad expression. 
                  Another tear, another sigh, and a dubious shake of the head. 
                  "Carrie!" 
                  It was scarcely loud enough to be heard. Carrie looked around. Broadwell had called her. 
                  "What do you want?" she said. 
                  "Come here and sit down." 
                  She retired from the mirror and sat alongside of him on the drivan. A respectable distance was held, and yet-and yet something in their ways and in their pose, left upon you the impression that these two beings-so different in character, temper, and station-had little to hide from one another and knew each other far better than their most intimate friends would ever have conjectured. There was a kind of familiarity apparent that would have raised suspicion in the most casual observer. 
                  By what links were they united? 
                  Let us not anticipate the future. 
                  Now they sat side by side, more like man and wife than hostess and guest. 
                  "Carrie," Broadwell commenced, after a short pause, "you are now avenged on Hannah. Edgar has deserted her." 
                  "What care I now?" she replied, with her head lowered over her bosom. "Nothing! nothing!" 
                  "Why? Was it not your only prayer to see your cousin miserable? And now your prayer has been heard-Hannah is a deserted wife-and still I find you not rejoicing." 
                  "What have I gained? Is not also Edgar-my Edgar-unhappy?" 
                  "Carrie, you speak nonsense, now. I thought you had long since forgotten your old attachment." 
                  "I have." 
                  "Why not rejoice?" 
                  "Because I can not." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "O, don't trouble me." 
                  Now another silence ensued. Broadwell once more began to play with his tooth-pick. 
                  "Do you still remember how Hannah ordered you from her presence?" he began, after a short pause. 
                  The red life-blood rushed into Carrie's cheeks, and her eyes began to sparkle. 
                  "Why do you remind me of this?" she said, fiercely. 
                  Without heeding this question, her reverend companion continued: 
                  "You have forgotten that she has not only robbed you of your lover, but of your honor and reputation; that she denied her relationship with you, and sent you word that you should no longer consider her your friend or kinswoman. You seem to have forgotten all this; have you, Carrie?" 
                  "No, I haven't." 
                  "That she spurned Lionel's offer of his hand, not because she did not love him, but simply because she envied you, Carrie, you the happiness you might have enjoyed in the affections of Edgar. Tell me," he continued, "is she not the sole cause of Lionel's fall? Remember what he has been, and what he is now!" 
                  "Don't!" she interrupted. 
                  "Well, I shall not mention any thing more about him. But for all this, and more, you owe thanks to Hannah." 
                  A frown crossed the brow of Carrie, and she arose from her seat and began to pace the floor. 
                  "Do you think of old times, when you still were happy?" Broadwell inquired, trying still more to arouse the demon spirit of her soul; "when you were the respected and honored daughter of the highly-esteemed Mr. Hugh Harrington? Do you think of those times when your hopes were as bright as the morning sun?" 
                  "Don't!" 
                  "Carrie! HANNAH is responsible for all your misery!" 
                  "I know it-I know it! But don't-" 
                  "Don't what?" 
                  "Don't remind me of it, unless it be for the purpose of completely overturning my already half-turned wits," she replied, throwing herself once more upon her seat. 
                  "Well, then, I won't. But for all this, and more, as I remarked before, you are indebted to Hannah." 
                  Once more a frown, like a dark shadow, passed over Carrie's brow. She turned her face upon her visitor's, gazed steadily upon it for a minute, and said: 
                  "Broadwell, I am fallen pretty low, am I not?" 
                  Her pale cheeks were calm, and her eyes were cold and sad. 
                  "The fallen stand higher than those who made them fall," remarked Broadwell; "and Hannah made you fall." 
                  Another frown on Carrie's brow. There was an expression of bitterness in her features, and a kind of recklessness-despair-written in her blue eyes. She rose from her seat with a show of impatience, but she did not move off; after erecting her figure, she once more seated herself upon the divan. 
                  "Broadwell!" she commenced, abruptly, "does Hannah grieve much?" 
                  "No, not at all," he replied. "She simply regrets the hastiness of Edgar in taking that step; it took her by surprise. She wanted preparation." 
                  "Preparation for what?" 
                  "For a charge-" 
                  "A charge?-" 
                  "Yes, Carrie; a charge of faithlessness toward her." 
                  "You surprise me," Carrie said, full of astonishment. 
                  "Nothing about Hannah should surprise you. She is as heartless as a stone. It was her intention to spread the rumor that Edgar had left house and home because his infidelity had been discovered; but pride, Carrie-wounded pride would not suffer her to carry it out. To be neglected by a husband is the greatest humiliation a wife can experience. She is aware of that; yes, Carrie, she is aware of that, and therefore will not bring any charge." 
                  "But she will have to advance some excuse for his absence," remarked Carrie. 
                  "True enough-if he should remain absent." 
                  "And do you think he will return again?" 
                  "I can't tell; at all events, Hannah is of that opinion. In the mean time, she will tell to one and all, her own parents not excepted, that Edgar has gone to New York on business with his publishers." 
                  A short pause ensued, and Carrie grew very thoughtful. She rose from her seat, and slowly paced the floor. The past, with all its bitterness and gall, came back to her memory. She stopped before the mirror, and looked into it. Where were her rosy cheeks and laughing eyes? She left the mirror with something wild and savage in her expression. She heaved a long sigh, and bit her lips; then returned to her seat. Broadwell was about to rise. 
                  "Keep your seat," she said, placing herself alongside of him, after which she continued: 
                  "Broadwell, I am fallen beyond redemption." 
                  "No, no, Carrie." 
                  Then she said, with a contemptuous look: 
                  "You know I am; why contradict it? Yes, I am fallen beyond redemption. I dare not-do not look for grace. I am lying in the deepest abyss of disgrace, never more to rise to the surface. I'm done for; so let that pass. But shall Hannah triumph over my fall without feeling some of its bitterness? No, no! I have lost all pity for the remorseless wretch!" 
                  "Think of your brother's fate-of your own," interrupted Broadwell, inwardly smiling. 
                  "I do think of it, and shall think of it, until I've had revenge to my satisfaction." 
                  "But you can't harm her, for she is rich and honored, and her husband will return-" 
                  "Never!" and the blood coursed to her cheeks and painted them red. "Hannah shall never more see Edgar." 
                  "But I have promised to assist her in bringing about a reconciliation between herself and him." 
                  Carrie changed color; her face looked white like bleached linen; her bosom heaved tumultuously; it labored under the greatest excitement; her eyes flashed fire, and her hands were clenched. There was a pause: neither one nor the other spoke. At last Carrie moved closer to Broadwell, and as she did so, he could feel how she trembled from the effects of his remark. 
                  "Broadwell!" she exclaimed, while her eyes flashed fire, "Broadwell, what do you mean? What do you mean?" 
                  She moved still nearer; their bodies touched, and they could feel each other's breath. Broadwell was about to rise; it was an unsuccessful attempt. She prevented it; with the strength of a madman, she grasped him around the neck. He made no effort to release himself, but remained calm, though he turned somewhat paler. 
                  "Carrie!" he said, in rather a suppressed, remonstrating, rebuking tone. 
                  Carrie was deaf; she was too excited to hear. Her bosom heaved faster and faster her eyes rolled savagely in their sockets, her lips trembled, her teeth chattered, and her hair seemed to assume a redder hue. She appeared an enraged fury, but poorly disguised in a woman's form. The transformation had almost been spontaneous. 
                  "Man! what do you mean?" she hissed, tightening her grasp. 
                  "Carrie! Carrie!" 
                  "What do you mean? What do you mean?" 
                  "What has come over you, Carrie?" 
                  "What do you mean? Do you mean to play me false?" 
                  "No!" 
                  She loosened her hold, dropped her hands upon her knees, and fell back upon her seat. She had been excited to the highest pitch, and now she was exhausted. She could scarcely breathe. Broadwell watched her for a moment, and then took hold of her hand. She snatched it away, and made the distance between them greater. 
                  "You did not let me speak out," he said, trying to conciliate her. "Have I not cause to hate Hannah as much as you have?" 
                  "Why did you promise, then, to be her friend?" 
                  "Is it possible that you, always so profound, can not see this bit of policy? You would have refused to serve her, had you been me? Would you not?" 
                  "I should." 
                  Broadwell smiled. 
                  "And would have suffered her to confide in some one else more faithful, would you?" 
                  Carrie did not reply. She became thoughtful. Broadwell had gained his point, and he knew it. He drew nearer, and again placed her hand in his. This time she did not withdraw it, but let it rest there. 
                  He continued: 
                  "Having me as her friend, is it likely that the reconciliation between herself and husband will soon be brought about? Trust me, Carrie Harrington, sooner shall I give up my life than the chance I have this day obtained to have revenge on your haughty, insolent cousin. She has once ordered me from her presence and her house. The insult has never been forgotten; it still rankles in my bosom, and will torment my soul until her happiness-like yours, like your brother's, and like Edgar's-has been sacrificed." 
                  "Are you serious?" 
                  "As there is a God above us!" 
                  "You have sworn it, Broadwell, and I trust you will be steadfast to your oath and purpose. But if you play me false," she continued, with animation, her bosom strongly heaving and her eyes flashing fire-"if you play me false, Broadwell-Broadwell-you know I have nothing more to lose on earth-the balance of my life shall be devoted to heaping curses upon your head!" 
                  "You will find me true to my purpose. Hannah, your haughty cousin, shall not escape my revenge. She has seen Edgar Armhold for the last time." 
                  "You will prevent a reconciliation then?" 
                  "Have I not sworn so, Carrie? Need I repeat the oath?" 
                  "No." 
                  A silence of several minutes ensued. Both-Mr. Broadwell and Miss Carrie Harrington-became thoughtful. At last the latter raised her head, looked upon her companion, then withdrew her gaze, and heaved a long sign. Broadwell heard it, also raised his head, and said: 
                  "Carrie, why so despondent?" 
                  A contemptuous look escaped her eyes, and a sneer played upon her lips. Bitterness seemed written in every line of her face. It was some time before she replied; when she did, it was in the following words: 
                  "You want to drive me mad-don't you?" 
                  "No, Carrie, dear." 
                  "O, leave off calling me 'dear,'"she replied, scarcely able to conceal her disgust. "Don't I know what your 'dear' means? You ought to see that I am in no humor for playing. Why, then, don't you let me alone?" 
                  "I discover you have one of your spells to-day," he said, without looking up from the floor. 
                  She replied not. Another pause. It lasted longer than the former. Broadwell once more began to play with his tooth-pick, and Carrie, heaving another sigh, rose from her seat, and, with a drooping head, began to pace the floor. After making several rounds, she stopped abruptly in front of the minister. Their eyes met: he was the first to withdraw his. 
                  "Look up," said Carrie. 
                  He did so. 
                  "Tell me, what do I live for?" she continued, in a voice that was as calm, as if not a mighty-a terrible storm-were raging within her bosom. 
                  Then Broadwell, with a voice and mien no less calm: 
                  "What you live for? Why, Carrie, I presume, for what everybody else lives for. To make the best of time, and enjoy life-that's what you live for." 
                  "Broadwell, look at me! Observe this taletelling face-" 
                  "Carrie!" 
                  "What enjoyment is left for me?" 
                  "Carrie, much, if you but wish to avail yourself of it. Remember, you are still young, and so is-Edgar." 
                  He said nothing else, but like a skillful angler, he lowered his face, so the expression of his eyes could not play traitor to him. He had thrown out a bait at the proper time. 
                  "And so is Edgar!" These words fell upon Carrie's ear so unexpectedly that she shrunk within herself when she heard them. A faintness took possession of her soul, and she felt like sinking to the floor. She seated herself-not on the divan-no, on a chair at the further end of the drawing-room. She lowered her head and grew thoughtful. "And so is Edgar!" These words awakened strange, indefinite, vague ideas in her head. She was afraid to understand them. But those ideas were there, and she could not banish them. She fell into a reverie, from which the voice of Broadwell aroused her. 
                  "Carrie!" 
                  She looked up and trembled as if she had been caught in committing a crime. 
                  "What do you want?" 
                  "We must win this Reuben Armhold to our side." 
                  "Well?" she faintly whispered. 
                  "You understand me?" he continued, in a low voice, in return. 
                  "Yes," she answered again, in a whisper. 
                  "He must become your friend, Carrie." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "And you must become his friend, Carrie." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "And we three shall form a party against Hannah." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "She shall be humbled-" 
                  "Well?" 
                  "I then shall have had revenge." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "So shall Reuben Armhold." 
                  "Well?" 
                  "And you, Carrie, shall become happy in the embrace of EDGAR ARMHOLD." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              AH, there are moments for us here, when, seeing 
                              Life's inequalities, and woe, and care, 
                              The burdens laid upon our mortal being 
                              Seem heavier than the human heart can bear. 
                           
                         
                        PHOEBE CAREY. 
                      
                   
                  WHEN Mr. Reuben Armhold, after his interview with his brother's wife, had returned to his hotel, the clerk presented him with a note, stating at the same time that the person who had left it at the office had, since then, twice been there to inquire whether it had or had not yet been delivered. Mr. Reuben Armhold, to the great astonishment of the clerk, remained very cool, and simply stuck the note unopened and unread, into his side-pocket, without exhibiting the least curiosity as to its contents. After remaining and passing to and fro in the office for a few short moments, he turned to the left and entered the reading-room, liberally supplied with leading journals?-no!-with fancy colored show-bills, theater advertisements, railroad circulars, and flaming circus-notices. Some very intelligent looking men were busily engaged in perusing the more attractive bills thus lying loosely upon the chairs, benches and tables. One trimmed-up gentleman, who was very conspicuous on account of his great display of diamonds on his shirtfront-conspicuous on account of his club feet lying upon the table that was two feet higher than the bench upon which he was lazily reclining-was holding a golden pencil in his right hand, between his thumb and index finger, which, taking size, shape and color in consideration, might have been that of a blacksmith, or a retired stable-boy, who had become, by the spite of nature to an honest and sensible man, a well-to-do country merchant. This gent copied upon his memorandum the direction to the theater, where "Mazeppa" was to be produced by the charming Kate Fisher, to the performance of which he had invited the aristocratic Miss Take Sometimes, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, who, in order to secure the custom of the greenhorn, had instructed her with grace to accept the invitation. Reuben, however, passed slowly across the room, without looking at any of the loungers or the literature meeting his eyes in every direction, and seated himself, somewhat apart from the others, upon a chair at the further end. Here he took the note from his pocket, opened and read it. It was from Mr. James Montgomery, and ran as follows: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "You see I waive all ceremonies; I simply call you 'Reuben' as of old. Now. Since you were at my house this morning, I have received tidings 'from' and 'of' your brother. Come at once. What I have to communicate to you is of the greatest importance. I should have called at the hotel myself had I been well enough to do so-but as I have not been well enough, and knowing you are considerable younger than myself, I hope you will excuse me, and, like myself, 'waive all ceremonies,' and come at once and dine with us. Who would have thought it? But never mind. Come, and you shall hear-who would have-well, I expect you to dinner. 
                              
                                 "Yours, truly, 
                                 "JAMES MONTGOMERY.'
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Reuben surely had his passions well under his control. Not a muscle, while reading these lines, stirred in his frigid face. The most ordinary information would have left more indication of its purport, in the expression of even a callous being and a fair dissembler, than this left on the face of Reuben. He had been calm and collected at Sing Sing, calm at his departure from his five years' imprisonment, calm at his arrival in Cincinnati, calm (after the first shock had been subsided) at the information of his parents' death, calm on meeting Broadwell, calm in the presence of his sister-in-law; aye, more than all this, he was calm in mentally reviewing his own thoughts-thoughts most terrible-thoughts that were engendered and matured in a mind bent upon the direst mischief toward his enemies-thoughts that congealed gealed the milk of kindness in his veins, and turned each drop of blood into gall; and, therefore, he remained calm in reading these lines. Now he slowly folded up the note, and as slowly replaced it in his pocket. Having done so, he looked at his time-piece. It was still early; dinner would not yet be served for an hour at this hotel. He rose from his chair, passed out upon the pavement, and purchased a "noon edition." Paper in hand, he once more retraced his steps, not into the reading-room, but into the office, where he applied for the key to his room, which the clerk, when he got ready-which was not the case for some time, however-delivered to him. Two minutes later found Reuben seated in his room, with shutters closed and curtains drawn down. 'Twas, as can be imagined, rather dark-too dark, in fact, to enable one to read. Reuben, who had taken a seat right close to the window, did not try to remedy the evil, though he might have done so without the least trouble. And yet the paper lay open before him, and his eyes were gazing down upon it, as if he were engaged in reading it. In this position he remained for some time. It must have been fifteen minutes before he laid the journal aside and rose from his seat. After erecting his form to its natural height, he began to pace the floor in slow, measured strides. His head was not lowered upon his bosom, but held up in a graceful attitude, giving him the appearance of a being firm, determined, unyielding in his resolution, as he was straight in his gait, mien and form. His face was pale and thoughtful; his eyes still and motionless as his features; his lips were closed, but not compressed, as if nature had never designed them to part. Thus he paced up and down the room, with his hands meeting behind. Not a sigh escaped his lips, not a frown was on his brow, not a tear was in his eyes; all was dry and dark. His brow, eyes, nose, cheeks, lips, chin-aye, his short, straight hair-all, all partook of that hardness, and reminded you of something soulless-of something without life and pulsation. Not a ray of hope lighted up the pale face. Not a smile ventured itself upon its features. Neither joy nor sorrow-neither love nor hate-neither pity nor heartlessness-controlled its expression. A blank! a blank! The Past seemed to have erased, instead of having marked that face with its record, and the Present defied the Future to undo the work it had completed. And still so young, scarcely having arrived at the age when man does truly begin life-begin his career. But he-Reuben Armhold-like thousands of others on this globe-had been hurried on in his journey, deprived of time for reflection by temptation held out too strong to be withstood, hurried on faster and faster, until he had seen and felt in youth both the pleasures and miseries of a whole span of life. How young, and still how old! He had seen enough of earth-too much of it-and would have cheerfully closed his eyes upon this world had his mission been entirely fulfilled. But he had vowed revenge, the direst revenge, on those who had embittered his past, blotted out his future, and extinguished the last spark of hope that had still flickered in his bosom. 
                  Yes, he had vowed to have revenge-had thought over it for five long, long years-it had kept him alive to this day, and he would not die before he had had it. But not the revenge of a hasty boy; O, no; he had long since ceased to be a boy, and could no longer play the boy. That time was passed with him. The revenge was to be that of a man whose sole aim and object was, and whose very life and existence depended upon the success and prolongation of the scarcely endurable pains it was to entail. His mother was dead! His father was dead! His brother was wretched and unhappy-perhaps worse than dead! And he himself! what was he? A stray being-a released convict! A wretch without kith or kin! An alien on earth and from the interests that bind man to man! He would have revenge, then die satisfied. 'Twas all that was left for him, and he would have it. He would not hurry himself. It mattered little how long or short that span of life. His whole time he could, in absence of all other business, devote to carrying out his resolve. Hence, we have found him so cool and collected-such a master over himself. Now he paced the room in slow, measured strides. Time did not seem to weigh heavily upon him. He exhibited no impatience. It was only after the bell had been rung twice, reminding him of dinner, that he repaired to the wash-stand and made a simple toilet. Shortly after, he left his room for the dining-hall. He ordered a frugal meal, ate it, and was first to leave the table. 
                  He looked at his time-piece. 'Twas still early. Taking a seat in the reading-room, now deserted by the loungers, he took the journal he had taken along with him when he left his own apartment, and began to peruse it. He scarcely had had time to look into it fairly, before the clerk made his appearance and handed him another note, then withdrew. Reuben laid the paper aside, opened the note, read it, placed it beside the other in his pocket, then rose from his chair and slowly left the hotel. 
                  He turned his steps toward the mansion of Mr. James Montgomery, on Ninth street, which place he reached in due time. 
                  "Where in the deuce have you kept yourself so long?" were Mr. Montgomery's first words to Mr. Reuben Armhold, after the latter had been conducted into the former's private library. "I have been momentarily expecting you ever since I sent you that small note this morning. You have received it? Haven't you? Yes? Very well. And after informing you that I had heard "of" and "from" your brother Edgar, you could remain away until now? I thought, if you had had wings, you would have flown here. But I perceive this would not have been the case. You even now display very little curiosity as to what I might have to communicate, but-and here he interrupted himself-"have you already dined? I trust not. We have been waiting with dinner until your arrival. Here!" and he addressed a servant who was just passing along the hall-"Here! tell my wife Mr. Armhold has come, and that she can have dinner ready as soon as she likes." Then to Reuben-"Sit down, pray, sit down, and waive all ceremonies. I can't bear to see men so overly decorous. You ought to have known this of old. Sit down-that's right; now to business-" 
                  Here Reuben Armhold interrupted the speaker. 
                  "Before proceeding upon business, as you term it," he said, "permit me to thank you for your hearty invitation, but, as I have dined before I came hither, I hope, dear sir, you will excuse me from sharing your hospitality this day." 
                  Mr. Montgomery, a full-souled man, was mortified at Reuben's objection. He therefore said: 
                  "Well, if you have already dined, why, I shall not force you to dine over again. I deem it, however, very ungenerous of you to have thus acted. I have tendered you an invitation early enough, and I'm sure 'twas from my heart, hence you ought to have come, Reuben-ought to have come-so you ought." 
                  "Excuse me, Mr. Montgomery. Should you, at some future period, honor me again with an invitation, I shall avail myself of it more readily." 
                  Just then, Mr. James Montgomery's daughter-the laughing, bright-eyed, golden-haired, rosy-cheeked, dimple-faced, mischievous-looking Nellie, of something like sixteen summers-came singing along the hall, and stopped in front of the door of the library. 
                  "'Pa," she said, in a voice full of melody, "if it is convenient to you-dinner is waiting." 
                  "Daughter, my dear," said her father, proudly looking upon his offspring-"come in that I may introduce you to Mr. Armhold, Edgar's brother, of whom I have spoken to you." Then turning to Reuben, "This is my daughter Nellie. She has always been a great favorite of your brother; I hope she will learn to esteem you, too." 
                  By this time Nellie had advanced into the room and was standing by the side of her father, in front of Mr. Reuben Armhold, who had risen from his chair in order to salute the daughter of his former employer. A sadness came over his pale features, as he looked upon that beautiful, blooming, blushing girl of "sweet sixteen," with rosy lips and laughing teeth. 
                  "I shall study to deserve her esteem," he replied, in a deep clear voice. 
                  "Well, 'pa," Nellie said, after a short pause, "will you and Mr. Armhold step into the dining hall?" 
                  "Mr. Armhold has dined," remarked her father, "before he came hither. I regret it sincerely, doubly so, since I had sent him a special invitation, which, for reasons best known to himself, he was pleased to decline." 
                  "O, Mr. Armhold!" she exclaimed, her laughing eyes roguishly turned upon the visitor, "why did you do that? Not dine with us! I'm sure 'pa will never forgive you for this." 
                  "Your father is generous to a fault-has forgiven me graver misdeeds, and, therefore, I feel confident of his pardon for this offense." 
                  "But if he should forgive you, I still know of some one who will not be so easily reconciled," Nellie said, mischievously nodding her head. 
                  "And who is that some one?" inquired Reuben, a faint, vague smile passing momentarily over his sleeping features. 
                  "And who is that some one?" she repeated, in a gleeful voice. "And who is that some one? Look at me! It is no less a person than Miss Nellie Montgomery. Now you know it; are you not troubled as to the consequences?" 
                  "I am," said Reuben. "To be at war with youth, beauty and virtue, is truly a calamity I should not be able to outlive." 
                  "What a flatterer! O, 'pa-" 
                  "Fie, fie, daughter!" interrupted Mr. Montgomery, fondly chiding Nellie. "Fie, fie! This is not the proper language to use. What right have you to call Mr. Armhold a flatterer?" 
                  "Why, 'pa," she broke forth in self-defense, a blush mantling her beautifully dimpled cheeks. "Mr. Armhold did flatter me, for he called me handsome-or said as much in other words; and I know he will pardon me for asserting it; he don't mean it." 
                  "You will never get through with Nellie, Reuben," added Mr. Montgomery, "so let us cease discussing this matter until after dinner. Daughter, tell mother I shall join her presently." 
                  Nellie smiled, bowed, threw a mischievous ogle at Reuben, then danced out of the library. 
                  No sooner were Mr. Montgomery and Mr. Armhold alone once more, than the former continued, at the same time pointing his visitor to a seat: 
                  "Where did we leave off? Yes, yes, I was just about to remark when my daughter came in, that in the future you must not only dine here, but make this, our house, your home. Yes, Reuben," and here he abruptly broke off, and said-"but, for goodness' sake, change that face o' yours-it's too sad, gloomy, aye, repelling-change it, else I must cease to call you Reuben, and address you as I would a stranger, 'Mr. Armhold.'" 
                  "Call me Reuben as of old, Mr. Montgomery, and mind not the expression of my features." 
                  "But what about making this your home?" 
                  "Let me thank you for your most generous invitation. You are an honest-honest man, in whose house none but honest men should dwell. Mr. Montgomery! Mr. Montgomery! I am not that man; no, I am not that man." 
                  How grave and sad these words! How cold and austere his looks! 
                  "Still recurring to the past," replied the good old gentleman, endeavoring to console Reuben, whom he thought referring to the robbery he had committed. "Still recurring to the past. Forget it, Reuben, forget it, I say. You have committed an error in your youth-others have done the same. Angels are scarce. When you will have grown as old as I am, you will know more of the world. With all the experience you might have had, you are still a young man, and a young man never can know half of what an old man knows. So off with your sober look, and show me that you can put on a more pleasant one. 'Sdeath! Had you been a convict, a penitentiary-bird-" 
                  "'Pa, come to dinner!" 
                  It was the clear, silvery voice of Nellie. 
                  "I'm coming, coming, daughter," Mr. Montgomery replied, stepping upon the door-sill and looking in the direction of the dining-room, from whence Nellie's voice had been heard. "I'm coming, I'm coming." 
                  "Do not let me keep you from-" Mr. Reuben Armhold could not finish the sentence. Mr. Montgomery interrupted him: 
                  "You do not keep me from anything," he replied, once more retracing his steps. "Where did I stop? Yes, yes. I was just remarking that you had been a convict, a penitentiary-bird, then I might have been slow in admitting you to my house. But you have never belonged to the chain-gang, have never worn the shackles of disgrace and dishonor; no, you have simply committed an error in your youth, of which you, undoubtedly, have a thousand-fold repented, and for which sin I, who was the only sufferer, have long since absolved you. Therefore, I say, 'Off with your sober look!' " 
                  "'Pa!" 
                  Mr. James Montgomery paused, and turned his face toward the door. Nellie was standing there, her tiny hands playing with the small, white apron which she had, since last we saw her, tied around her slender waist. 
                  "I'm coming, daughter." 
                  "Perhaps Mr. Armhold would prefer joining us at the dining-hall to remaining here by himself," Nellie said. 
                  "I sincerely regret my coming here at so inopportune a time," remarked Mr. Armhold. "I trust, however, that my presence will at once be forgotten, and that you will no longer keep your family in waiting on my account. With your leave," turning toward Nellie, "I shall look over your album, which is lying here, and see whether I can find, among its many photographs, any familiar faces." 
                  "Certainly, I give you leave to look over its contents," she said, picking it up and placing it in Reuben's hands. "You will meet with many pretty faces in there, the ugliest of which will not be that of Miss Nellie Montgomery;" and, with a silvery laugh and a coquettish ogle, she danced back to her father's side, with whom she, after a few other unimportant words had been exchanged, left the room. 
                  Reuben was once more alone. His eyes followed that happy pair-father and daughter-until they were out of sight. And even then, after they had disappeared, and their tread could no longer be heard in the hall, he still looked toward the door with an abstract air, as if he still had a view of those forms. Between his hands he held the album; it was both large and heavy, but he seemed not to care for its size or weight. A silvery laugh-it came from the dining-hall, and sounded like that of the bright-eyed, golden-haired, rosy-cheeked, dimple-faced Nellie-aroused him from his short reverie, and brought him back to a state of wakefulness. He lowered his head and saw the album. It was still unopened in his hands, just as Nellie had given it to him. Now he seated himself, heaved a sigh, wetted his dry lips with the tip-end of his tongue, straightened himself up in his chair, and then began to look over the cartes-de-visite. In this occupation, like every other, he displayed no hurry. Slowly page after page was turned and looked upon. Little interest had those faces for him. Presented they youth or age, beauty or hideousness, intellect or weakness, male or female, boy or girl, man or woman-nothing possessed the power to make a thought of his its own. It is true, he looked upon one and all as he progressed in his survey, but it was a mechanical labor, affording him neither pain nor pleasure. 
                  He had but a few more pages to turn. The nearer a man is to his journey's end, the more hurried are his steps; the nearer a man is to the completion of a task, the more eager is he to hasten its completion. It was no longer so with Reuben. Though he had been engaged nearly a whole half-hour in looking on those cartes-de-visite, yet in turning the remainder, he exhibited the same indifference and patience as with which he undertook the occupation. 
                  Almost through. Only six pages remained to be examined. He turned the first of those six. The photograph of a man! He gazed upon it at first with the same indifference to which all the rest preceding it had been subjected; but gradually, as his eyes were fixed upon it, they brightened up, and his face underwent a change. It grew paler, if from a pale white to a pale green could make him look paler than he already had been. The color it now assumed, and for some time retained, reminded one of something sickly, of something poisonous-of something that had DEATH in it. This was not all. He slowly raised himself up-that is, his upper body, for he remained in a sitting posture-and as he did so his broad, manly chest expanded, his lips tightened upon each other, and through his dilated nostrils the breath passed in and out, quick, fast, and loud. The album trembled in his hands, and his hands trembled on his knees, which pressed against one another with a force that would have left an indentation upon any thing less adamantine than those adamantine knees. They pressed down and up, and sent a deadened weight-a heavy, lead-like numbness-through his whole system. It penetrated to the heart, it penetrated his mind, and seemed to deprive each of its function. A heavy load pressed him down. 
                  Again the album lay quietly in his hands. Nothing trembled now; and even the breath through his nostrils came slower and with more regularity. He had struggled with himself, and had come off master.
                   
                  Still his eyes were riveted upon that photograph! What strange thoughts it awakened in his mind! And yet he saw nothing but fingers of ice which were too stiff to bend, too strong to break-too icy to melt, even by the perpetual fires of the nether world! 
                  Fifteen minutes more! Still he gazed upon that photograph! Some one came along the hall, entered the room, advanced to where he sat, and still he raised not his face. It was only after his name had been pronounced that he looked up. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery," he said, as calmly and with as much self-possession as if he had nothing to trouble his mind withal, "I hope you have not hurried yourself on my account;" and was about to close the album, when Montgomery's eyes fell upon the carte-de-visite which had for so long a time drawn Reuben's attention. 
                  "A fine face, this of Broadwell," he commenced, taking the album into his own hands-"isn't it? But, by-the-by, you were unusually excited this morning when you beheld this picture. I never saw one so excited in all my life. Do you know the reverend gentleman?' 
                  "The reverend gentleman? No, I do not know him," was Reuben Armhold's answer, after a short pause. 
                  "Well, of him I want to speak to you," Mr. Montgomery now remarked, closing up the album and laying it back upon the marble stand. "Yes, of him I wish to speak to you," and he took a seat alongside of Reuben. 
                  "Of him?-of him? And not of my brother?" inquired Reuben. "And what can you wish to speak to me of him?" 
                  "He called on me soon after you had left this morning." 
                  Reuben began to tremble, and his face to turn a shade paler. What could he be afraid of? 
                  "And inquired of you who I am?" 
                  "No." 
                  Reuben felt relieved, breathed easier, and the natural color came back to his face. 
                  "Or wanted to have speech with me?" 
                  "No; he came to tell me-now, don't feel uneasy-he came to tell me of your brother's desertion of his wife!" 
                  Here Montgomery made a dead halt, and fell back upon his seat. Reuben received this bit of news with a gravity and calmness that truly surprised his former employer, who continued, after a short pause: 
                  "Yes, the Reverend Doctor informed me even of the circumstances that led to this desertion. Ill-treatment on one side; pride and resentment on the other. It had to come to this, sooner or later. But, Reuben, how in the world can you receive this news with such an indifference?" 
                  "'Tis no longer news to me," he replied calmly; "I have heard of this event at my brother's own house." 
                  "You have? From whom?" Mr. Montgomery inquired, eagerly. 
                  "From Edgar's wife. But suffer me to know-if know I may-the version this Reverend gentleman gives to this affair," Reuben added, a sinister glance shooting from his black eyes, and a bitter smile curling his thin lips. 
                  "The whole version I cannot give you," Mr. Montgomery replied now; "O, no, I am poor at relating any thing, and can't arrange my thoughts so to make the least connection. More than that I was so taken by surprise with this information that when Mr. Broadwell, who, by-the-by, takes an unusually great interest in this affair, had got through, I could scarcely remember half of what he had said. But what I do know, Reuben-if you are only patient and don't hurry me-why, you shall know." 
                  "Mr. Montgomery, pray take your time. See, I'm calm and labor not under the least excitement. I have understood you to say that there had been 'ill-treatment' on one side, and 'resentment and pride' on the other. Am I to understand that Edgar tyranized over and abused his wife?" 
                  "Yes," Montgomery replied; "but I said, most emphatically, to Mr. Broadwell, that as far as 'ill-treatment' was concerned, it was an unmitigated falsehood, and that I would at any moment re-assert it in the face of Mrs. Armhold herself. I told him, when he urged this charge, that he knew not Mr. Armhold as well as I did, else he would blush in believing such an accusation against a man who was every inch of him, all honor, kindness, love and gentleness. Reuben! when he saw that I would not suffer this imputation to rest upon Edgar's character, he said that Hannah-I presume-yes, yes, I have told you that that is your brother's wife's name-that Hannah, under some circumstances, might have given her husband cause at times, to lose his temper, to which I, however, was not slow in remarking that Edgar Armhold could never have lost his temper, so far as to have used a single harsh word, however great the provocation might have been, toward his wife." 
                  "This against my brother; now what against his wife?" inquired Reuben. 
                  "Now what against his wife?" Mr. Montgomery repeated, almost raising himself up from his seat. "What against his wife? Do you really think I can remember half of what he said of her? No, no; you musn't expect such a thing of me. First he ac-cused her, then he ex-cused her, and so he went on for upward of half an hour. Said: Hannah felt sorry that Edgar had left her, then again he would say she was glad that he had deserted her, for with it her family troubles were over and she could live in peace." 
                  "But the principal cause for this event?" interrupted Reuben. 
                  "Principal cause?" Mr. Montgomery ejaculated. "Principal cause? They were all principal causes. But one of the chiefest ones was the difference of their religious opinions. You are aware that your brother's wife is a Christian, and as such thought it her duty to bring up her child in her faith. Edgar, so I'm told, opposed this with all his authority, which, however, his wife in this particular disregarded. It came at last to an open rupture, when Hannah was to have said to her husband that, rather than see her child grow up a Jew, she would kill it and its father, whom she had long since ceased to love. Your brother, being sensitive to the extreme, I presume, rather than to see his wife unhappy, left his house and home, consoling himself with the thought of having done his duty." 
                  Here Mr. James Montgomery stopped, and observed another pause. 
                  "And you say this Reverend Mr. Broadwell takes quite an interest in this affair?" inquired Reuben, thoughtfully, at the same time vaguely staring through the open door. 
                  "O, most assuredly he does. You must know that your brother's wife is a member of his church, and that she has confided unto him. Yes, he intends to stand by her unto death, and promises to obtain a divorce for her." 
                  "Does she wish to be divorced?" 
                  "It is Mr. Broadwell's opinion, and he would not have risked such a remark had he had no foundation for it." 
                  "Upon what ground does he expect to receive a divorce?" 
                  "Indeed I don't know." 
                  Reuben rose to his feet and straightened himself up. He did not move off, however, but remained standing before the chair, as if rooted to the floor. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery!" 
                  Mr. Montgomery raised his head, and Reuben continued: 
                  "You were a friend of my brother." 
                  "More than a friend-a father." 
                  "Will you protect his reputation during his absence?" 
                  "With my honor, Reuben-with my very life. But his character is above reproach, and I feel confident that his wife will not venture to calumniate it." 
                  A frown passed over Reuben's brow. 
                  "Is not this Reverend Broadwell her confidant?" he said demurely. 
                  "He is. At least he said so, and I know he would not be guilty of telling a falsehood." 
                  Reuben laughed! What a horrid laugh! His whole face was contorted as if in the greatest agony. Mr. Montgomery became frightened; but before he had time to give vent to his fear, Reuben wildly ejaculated: 
                  "He would not tell a falsehood? He? He? He? HE?" and he burst forth in another hideous laugh, and hurried across the room, with doubled-up fists, knitted brow, and gnashing teeth. "He would not tell a falsehood? Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!" His teeth came together with an unnatural force. Mr. Montgomery could plainly hear them gnash and grind for a moment. His face alternately became blue, white, green, then white again. His whole frame shook, and his hair seemed to raise itself on ends. Thus he hurried hitherward and thitherward. 
                  Twice, thrice, four times across the room. 
                  He stopped. Stopped at once. 'Twas a dead halt. He pressed his fists still tighter together, and made a movement with his lips as if he were gulping something large, bitter, repugnant, down his throat. 
                  The struggle was over; he had again come off "Conqueror!" A long breath-and his fists, that were clenched, opened, his face was again of its natural color, and its features once more assumed their stony, calm look. 
                  The struggle was over. 
                  He lowered his head and met the eyes of Mr. Montgomery. 
                  "Be not surprised at what you have just seen," he said to the latter in a faint voice. 
                  "Good God!" gasped the old gentleman, "you have almost frightened me out of my wits. Who is this Reverend Dr. Broadwell? What do you know of him? What secret do you carry in your bosom? Tell me. I'm bound to know." 
                  A pause. A long, long pause. Mr. Reuben Armhold was the first to break it. He advanced to where Mr. Montgomery sat gasping. He sat himself alongside of him He took his hand and held it between his own. He looked into his eyes, and all the while his features remained as calm as if they were locked in death. Nothing betrayed the terrible commotion within. He was himself again. 
                  He commenced to speak. His voice was deep, sonorous, and rolling. No haste: no tremor-all even, smooth, and natural. 
                  "My conduct calls for an explanation. I have exhibited a weakness in your presence; let me account for it." 
                  "Who is this Reverend Doctor Broadwell?" 
                  "I don't know him," was the calm reply. 
                  Montgomery could scarcely believe it. 
                  "You don't know him?' he re-echoed. 
                  "I do not." 
                  A dead pause. 
                  "You do not?" And Mr. Montgomery fell back upon his seat. "What's the matter, then?" 
                  Another pause-longer than the first. Reuben looked his former employer straight in the eyes. 
                  "What then?" repeated Montgomery. 
                  "I'm mad! Have just been released from the lunatic asylum!" 
                  Had a thunderbolt crushed with its weight. Montgomery's exhausted frame, he could not have looked more a picture of death than he did as these words fell upon his ears. He could not speak-he could not gasp. 
                  "What! what!" 
                  "Calm yourself," said Reuben, coolly; "these fits, these wild outbursts, come upon me but occasionally. This one you have just witnessed was the first I have had within the last twelve-month." 
                  Mr. Montgomery stared at him. He was still too bewildered to speak. Reuben continued: 
                  "I am not dangerous, nor have I been so at any time during the whole course of my illness." 
                  "Mad!" muttered Mr. Montgomery to himself, thoughtfully, then nodded his head. 
                  A faint, vague smile came and lingered upon Reuben's lips for a moment. 
                  "The word conveys more than it should in my case. I have used the strongest expression in the vocabulary in the spur of the moment." 
                  "Mad!" 
                  "No, not mad, but melancholy has been hovering, like a dark cloud, over my mind. Simply an unaccountable depression of spirit, which I am gradually losing. Nothing more. Remember that since my arrival here I have heard of so much unpleasant news-of both my parents' death, my brother's sickness and unhappy life; can it still surprise you then that I should have lost my equanimity for a moment, when thinking over these many unexpected misfortunes?" 
                  "No, no, Reuben, had you burst out in grief this morning when we spoke of your parents' death, I should have thought it more natural than the stoical indifference you then exhibited. But then, as now, Broadwell and Broadwell's picture only had the effect to disturb the equilibrium of your equanimity. Think me not rude-in what way or manner is this man known to you?" 
                  "As you honor my absent brother, and as you would spare me ill-feelings, I pray you-thousand fold pray you-no longer to urge this question." 
                  "You have made me feel uneasy, both on account of your brother and yourself. You know my services are at your command." 
                  "You have my thanks. But now, what from my brother?" 
                  Mr. Montgomery handed him a note, which ran as follows: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 "MR JAMES MONTGOMERY:
                               
                              "My dear and honored friend:-When these lines will reach you I shall be far from the city which I have seen for the last time. Why I have taken such an abrupt departure I shall leave to my dear wife, who shall always have my prayers, to answer. She has no husband now; my son, my dear, dear son, no father. Supply, O, supply, during my absence, the place of both. I know you will do it; I am confident you will. I have nothing else to say. Inclosed find a check for $10,000, which amount please place to my brother's credit at your house. Should he never return, but I trust he will, accept it as a small token of my friendship for you and yours. 
                              
                                 "Yours, respectfully, 
                                 "EDGAR ARMHOLD."
                               
                            
                            
                              "P. S.-Pardon me for this unnecessary repetition. See to my wife and child, and commend them to my brother's special care, if he should return. I shall write to you once more from New York. 
                              
                                 E. A."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Reuben Armhold still gazed upon that note long after he had read it. He was thinking over its contents, and more than once turned over in his mind the sentence contained therein. "Why I have taken such an abrupt departure, I shall leave to my dear wife, who shall always have my prayers, to answer!" He was trying to discover a reason that seemed plausible, why Edgar should have refrained from opening his heart, in this particular, to a friend whose faith and unselfishness he had tried, and in whose honor, secrecy, and confidence he had always trusted. Was Edgar conscious of a wrong toward Hannah of which he was ashamed, and now feared to acknowledge? Or had he no confidence in Mr. Montgomery? Or thought he it not worth his while, or his duty to give an explanation to any one for his conduct? Reuben could not pursuade himself that such was the case. Thefore be studied and studied. He had heard sufficient, since his return home to know in how high an estimation his brother Edgar was held, both on account of his virtues and talent, in circles whose praise and good opinion give the tone to society. He knew, also, sufficient of his character to assure him that he would not act hastily and without forethought in any thing, and least of all in staking, his hard-earned reputation. And yet that reputation was staked! He had gone from house and home, wife and child, without leaving an excuse behind him to silence slanders and imputations. Whatever the reasons for his departure, he had even kept them from Mr. Montgomery, his true and tried friend, and left it to Hannah to give such explanations as she would deem proper to advance, under such circumstances. 
                  Reuben returned the letter to Mr. Montgomery. He imagined to have found a solution. 
                  
                     Edgar would not criminate his wife-the mother of his own child! Rather than to put blame on her-than to say one word against her even to his friend, who had stood by him, as a father, he would suffer the world, by his silence, to draw wrong inferences, and to censure him for his conduct. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery," commenced Reuben, "you were kind enough to give me an invitation to make your house my home, and I declined to accept this most generous proposition. But since I have read this note of my brother, I have changed my mind, and would most gladly, if you permit me, retract my words." 
                  "And think you I would not have made you retract them? O, take my word for it, I should. The brother of Edgar Armhold, while in Cincinnati-and I trust he will remain here always-shall know of no other home, unless he gets one of his own, than the house of James Montgomery, and no warmer friends than his family. Do you hear this, Reuben? Now, any time during the day you can have your baggage, trunk, etc., brought over from the Gibson House. Do you hear? Or, if you like it, I shall send the porter after them. Yes, I think it is the better plan." 
                  So saying, he rose from his chair and rung a small bell. Soon after, a servant appeared, to whom he spoke a few words in an under tone. 
                  "Your baggage will be here shortly," Mr. Montgomery said to Reuben, and once more took his seat. "Coming back to the topic of our conversation," he continued, "I want to impress that fact upon your mind that when I tendered you an invitation to make your home with us, I meant it from my whole heart. We have plenty of room here, and I trust that the efforts of my wife and daughter to please you will reconcile you to your fate, and make you forget the great loss you have sustained in the death of your parents. My wife is generous, and my daughter Nellie, as you have seen, is a little mischievous thing, always smiling, laughing, and therefore well calculated to drive away your melancholy. You will find plenty of friends; and as your brother has remembered you with the handsome sum of $10,000, you will be enabled to live for the present without entering into any business. As to Edgar's affair, something will have to be done. His letter is quite unsatisfactory. Were I not convinced of his truth, sincerity and friendship, I should feel inclined to believe in his want of confidence in me. But I am sure that he understands my heart, and therefore I know that other motives prompted him to conceal every thing from me. But, as I remarked, something has to be done. I fear Edgar's sacrificing himself is a mistaken duty. When he sends us his address-" 
                  "We shall probably know more of this affair than we do now, and shall be guided by it," added Reuben. "For the present nothing more can be done than to remain quiet. His departure will soon be public, and Rumor, with her wicked tongue, will not be slow in spreading her many tales. Mrs. Armhold then will have to unfold her banner, and show the color under which she intends to sail. For or against her husband. If for him, all right and well-if against him,"-here he paused a moment, then continued, in a manner and tone of voice as if he were weighing every word-" if against him, all right and well, too." 
                  "I shall speak," Mr. Montgomery added, "to Mr. Broadwell about this affair; and as I know that he possesses great influence over the members of his church, and especially over your sister-in-law, I shall try to win him over to our cause, and induce him to act as arbitrator, if it should become necessary to have one." 
                  "We shall need no arbitrator between my brother and his wife," Reuben replied. "If only a misunderstanding had existed, Edgar, I am confident, would have been able alone to clear it up. Yes, Reverend Doctor Broadwell shall become a friend of mine. I shall, when opportunity offers itself, beg you to introduce me to him, and I shall ask him for such information and assistance as one friend will be entitled to ask from another. So much for Mr. Broadwell. Now one word for myself, Mr. Montgomery. I have told you that I had been sick and confined in an asylum. That I had been a slave to melancholy, and that at times I had been a subject to sudden and violent attacks of a heated mind. I shall also tell you now that I have once more grown healthy-grown healthy this day-and by reading my brother's letter addressed to you. Melancholy no longer, gloomy no longer, sad no longer. These things belong to the past, and shall be buried with it. You knew me when I was a mere strippling. How wild and lively was I then! How devil-I-care and reckless! I shall be equally as spirited again, only I shall now have an object in view, Mr. Montgomery, which I had not then. If my life has been a blank until this day, I shall make up for it in the future. What use is there for sighing and weeping? None, Mr. Montgomery, none." 
                  He rose from his seat and crossed the room. A moment later he sat again alongside his host. He was about to continue in his conversation, when the sound of the bell rung loudly through the hall, and thereby prolonged the silence. A servant had scarcely had time to open the door fairly, before a gentleman, appearing to be of the same age as Reuben, without the least ceremony approached and entered the room in which our two friends were seated. He removed his hat, and, as he did so, exposed an intellectual forehead, which would have been pronounced handsome, had not a deep scar, that ran almost down to his eyes, married it. Reuben recognized him in an instant. It was Lionel Harrington, and that scar the scar that he had made upon that head some thirteen years ago. Reuben had not forgotten that countenance, nor the last struggle that he had had with him five years ago at Mr. Preston's, when in search of his brother Edgar on the evening of his own flight. 
                  "Excuse me, gentlemen," Lionel commenced, with that boldness so characteristic of the spoiled child of fortune, "for interrupting your conversation for a moment. But I am in the greatest hurry imaginable; Mr. Montgomery a moment-" 
                  So saying, he hastily retraced his steps from the room, and Mr. Montgomery, after excusing himself to Reuben, followed his new visitor into the hall. 
                  "What do you want, Lionel?" 
                  "I must have five hundred dollars, and that in less than fifteen minutes," he replied, scarcely able to keep back his impatience. 
                  "You know I loaned you five hundred dollars last Thursday, and they are still unpaid," Montgomery gently remonstrated, for he liked the youth and did not wish, by harsh words, to wound his feelings. "I really do not know what you are doing with all your money. I am only afraid you are growing to be a great spendthrift." 
                  "Mr. Montgomery, if you let me have the five hundred dollars, I shall consider it the greatest favor you have ever rendered me. I must liquidate a debt before night. My honor is pledged, Mr. Montgomery, and I know of no other place where to raise the money in the short time that's left me. I shall pay you back in a day or two, with a thousand thanks. Can I have it?" 
                  "Well, if you can't do without it, as a matter of course, you shall have it. But, Lionel, Lionel, I fear you are going to be a great spendthrift," repeated the good-natured old man. 
                  "No more than any other young fellow," laughingly said the other; and, taking Mr. Montgomery under his arm, led him back into the room. 
                  Fifteen minutes later Mr. Lionel Harrington might have been seen hurrying up Baker street, and enter one of the many gambling holes found thereon. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XVI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              THERE'S no way to make sorrow light 
                              But in the noble bearing; be content; 
                              Blows given from heaven are our due punishment; 
                              All shipwrecks are not drownings; you see buildings 
                              Made fairer from their ruins. 
                           
                         
                        W. ROWLEY'S NEW WONDER. 
                      
                   
                  WHEN Lionel came home that evening, it was already very late-nearly ten o'clock. With the exception of his sister Carrie, every person about the house had retired to bed. She, however, was awake and watching-watching for the return of her brother. He, had come, and was now hurrying up the flight of stairs and along the passage upon which both his and her own apartments were situated. She opened the door just in time to intercept him. 
                  "Lionel!" she said, thoughtfully looking upon her brother's flushed face, "come in!" 
                  "What do you want?" he rejoined, with a kind of ill-humor and impatience. "Why are you not in bed? Don't you know it's almost ten o'clock?" 
                  "I know it, Lionel," she said, slowly and gravely. "But I could not have slept, even if I had retired. And then I do want to speak to you, Lionel, and so I thought I would wait for your coming." 
                  "And what do you want, Carrie?" he inquired, following her into her room, the door of which he closed behind him. 
                  "O, Lionel, Lionel, Lionel dear, don't be angry with your sister!" she commenced, amid sobs and tears, and, twining her arms around his neck, she threw her head upon his bosom. 
                  "I am not angry, Carrie. But what's the matter? Are you crazy? I really do believe that you are!" he continued, after a short pause, seeing that her agitation rather increased than diminished. 
                  "O, Lionel, Lionel, I am so unhappy!" she sobbed. Why, why can I not end this miserable existence? God! O God!" 
                  "Carrie, you are crazy! Calm yourself, and tell me what's up." 
                  "Nothing, nothing, Lionel-nothing; only that I have prayed for death, and-" 
                  "And as usual, made a fool of yourself," her brother added, at the same time placing her upon a sort of settee, and seating himself by her side. "Yes," he continued, "you will not rest with bothering your mind about strange things that are past and beyond remedy, until you really do become crazy. I tell you what it is, Carrie, this way of doing must be stopped at once, else you will kill both you and me." 
                  "God forbid!" she exclaimed, and pressed a fervent kiss upon her brother's brow. "And yet, 'twere better to be dead than to lead such a life. O, Lionel, Lionel, my dear Lionel!" 
                  "Now I have heard enough of this wailing, Carrie. If you called me in here simply to make me feel miserable, I shall leave you at once and retire to my bed." 
                  "And has it come at last to such a pass, that I may not speak to my brother, and open to him my heart? To whom else shall I confide my sorrows and woes, if not to you, my brother? Are you not my all? Have I any one else on earth? O, Lionel, Lionel, you are very, very cruel!" 
                  "No, I'm not. I only do not wish you to make a fool of yourself. You know I would die for you. But then I want you to be wise, and cease brooding over what's past. Do as I do: go about, and forget yourself in pleasure and excitement. Moping at home will not remedy the matter; it simply makes it worse. Here you sit from morning till night, looking through the window, or reading some dry stuff. Damn it! be lively in spite of yourself; go into company, and be the merriest of the merry. I should not gratify the world so much as to let her find out that I felt miserable. Don't you know how wicked the best of us are? You can not please your would-be friends more than by publishing your misery. Go, and, as I have told you repeatedly, laugh to scorn all your trials and humiliations. Show the world that you can smile and play the lady as much as you ever did; and when she is convinced of your resolution not to suffer yourself to be put down, the very ones who now speak against you, and would crush you, will be the very first to fawn upon and flatter you." 
                  "And what then?" 
                  "And what then? Why, you will live again." 
                  Carrie shook her head in sadness, and then said: 
                  "'T is all over with me, Lionel-all over with me. You do not understand me. My heart is broken. I require nothing; I want nothing except your sympathy, Lionel, and some kind words when I am down in spirits. It makes me feel easier, and then I can weep a little, which lightens my heart." 
                  "Well, Carrie, I shall never use another harsh word to you;" and Lionel, the thoughtless Lionel, tenderly kissed his poor sister. 
                  "Lionel!" she said, nodding her head in sadness, "you have been drinking again; your breath-" 
                  "Smells of whisky, and the worst of whisky at that; I know it," he added. 
                  "You promised me never more to touch the bottle." 
                  "I know it, sister, but I can't help it. It is just so. I must drink or die. At first I drank for pleasure; but now I drink in order to drawn my sorrows." 
                  Tears flowed freely down Carrie's pale face. She arose, twined her arms around his neck, kissed his lips, and sobbed: 
                  "Are we not miserable, indeed?" 
                  A frown passed over Lionel's brow, and his eyes receded in their sunken sockets. He loosened Carrie's arms from around his neck, and dropped them by her side; then, turning to one side, placed his elbow against the back of the settee, and suffered his head to drop upon the open palm of his hand. Carrie was still weeping when he darted up from his seat. He threw a hasty glance at the bowed-down figure by his side, took a cigar from his pocket, and, without lighting it, placed it between his lips, and walked up and down the room, halting at every step or two-not as if he was thinking or brooding over any thing in particular, but more like a man who was restless and troubled about matters that had gone amiss and could not be set aright, and from the effects of which both his sister and himself were suffering, and were likely to suffer-he never would question himself for how long. 
                  "Carrie!" he said, in a bitter tone, biting off the cigar between his lips, then casting it in the grate, fiercely, "I wish mother were in h-!" He threw himself into a rocking-chair-formerly his father's but now Carrie's, in Carrie's own room-and, after crossing, his left leg over his right, and taking out his pocket-knife and playing with its narrow, shining blades, began to rock himself so wildly, that it threatened to upset him at every moment. Carrie had scarcely heard these terrible words, before she was up and by her brother's side, with her trembling hands placed over his mouth. 
                  "For God's sake, Lionel," she commenced, her whole face turning white as marble, "don't-don't." 
                  "Why don't?" he said, removing her hands from his lips. "Why, don't? Whom have we to thank for all this misery-this humiliation but that damned-" 
                  Again Carrie's hands were placed over his mouth. She could not hear the terrible word that was to follow. She turned her head in every direction, fearful that some one might have listened to that dreadful curse. 
                  "Don't speak thus of her, it makes me shudder to hear you curse our own mother," she said, and then fell upon her knees before him, buried her head in both her hands, and, rocking herself to and fro, sobbed aloud. 
                  "Carrie," he shrieked, half frantic, his eyes glistening like two balls of fire, and the red blood rushing to his face, "what do you take me for? For a hero in a sentimental novel, who weighs every word before he speaks them, in order not to shock the sensitive nerves of this feline world? Why shall I be choice about expression? Why? Why? Tell me why? Is it because we owe that woman so many thanks for robbing us of our honor, wealth and peace of mind-" 
                  "Don't! don't! You'll break my heart," she sobbed, full of despair. 
                  "Or is it for disgracing the ashes of our father in the grave, by living like a strumpet after his death?" 
                  "Don't! don't!" 
                  "Why? What did she ever do for us-tell me, what did she ever do for us," he continued, with the same vehemence, "that I should not curse her? What kind of training did she give us? Ha! you remain silent. You won't speak? Did she not always let us do as we pleased? And why? Because she loved us? No! Don't believe that, Carrie-no! It was because she cared not for our welfare-whether we would grow up good or bad-whether our future be bright or clouded. Our mother!" he now exclaimed, curling his lips in bitterness; "our mother! how could she have loved her children when she didn't love the father of those children? Carrie! I know it is a horrible, a shocking thing, to curse a mother! I know it! I know it! But look here-look here-for God's sake, look here, and see what she has made of you and me. Don't you think it enough to make any man-to make a saint curse? Yes, what's left for us to do? You are right, Carrie, you are right: 'twere better we were dead and buried. What am I? A gambler and a drunkard! And what are you-" 
                  Here a groan escaped from Carrie's lips, and she fell backward on the floor. Lionel stopped speaking. Not another word escaped him. He looked down upon his sister. She had swooned. A moment later he had her in his arms, and was carrying her to the settee, more like a corpse than a living being. 
                  "I won't say any thing more," he whispered in her ears, then turned around, threw himself in the arm-chair, lighted a cigar and began to smoke, now and then throwing a thoughtful glance upon that pale face-the image of death.

                              Sad on the jutting eminence he sits, 
                              And views the main that ever toils below; 
                              Still fondly forming in the farthest verge, 
                              Where the round either mixes with the wave, 
                              Ships, dim-discover'd, drooping Som the clouds: 
                              At evening, to the setting-sun he turns 
                              A mournful eye, and down his dying heart 
                              Sinks helpless.

                  FIVE days later. It was between the hours of nine and ten A. M., when the Reverend Doctor Broadwell returned from the postoffice to his study. He laid his hat on the table, then seated himself into his armchair. Something unusual must have happened, for he looked very pale and thoughtful. His eyes were vaguely turned upon the opposite wall, while his fingers were playing with a small golden tooth pick. After the expiration, of a few minutes, however, he drew a letter from his side pocket. It was still unopened, was post-marked "New York," and addressed to Mrs. Edgar Armhold. He knew the handwriting. He had seen it a thousand times, and among a thousand others would have recognized it as Edgar's. 
                  A smile-a wicked smile-passed over his lips, as he carefully opened his pen-knife, and with the back of its blade loosened the envelope, which he was very particular not to mutilate. This done, he laid the knife aside and unfolded the letter. "From Edgar, as I expected," he remarked to himself, then began to read its contents, which ran as follows: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 11, 18-.
                               
                              DEAR WIFE: Be not surprised at receiving, nor angry in perusing these few lines-perhaps the last in my life I shall ever address to you, my once loved Hannah, the mother of my child. I have just arrived in this city, after a two days' journey, suffering both mentally and physically, and here I sit, afar from home and friend, a self-exiled invalid, overpowered by the tender feelings of the "husband" and "father," penning my last adieu to the woman whom my love has made unhappy. Think not that I am about to reproach you for that indifference you have displayed toward me for years past, or for withholding from me that love for which my heart has been constantly craving. No, wife-O, let me once more call you by that name-I do not reproach you for any thing, but pity you for the misery I have been the innocent cause to occasion you. Do I not know that we can not create a will from which our passions receive vitality? I loved you, because I could not help loving you. Thus my nature; thus my feeling. Nothing that you could do had the power to abate that love. It was part of my existence, the quintessence of my life. You do not love me now. How can I be angry, or blame you for a want of feeling, which it is not in your power to create? No, Hannah, I am more generous than that. I absolve you from any desire to wrong me, were such an absolution necessary. But there is not. You simply followed your inclination-what else could you do? What else has ever any body done? Are we not slaves unto ourselves, and mere puppets moved by unseen hands? Therefore, I have no reproaches to make. It is true that you once swore to love your Edgar, but then you did love him, and never thought a change of feeling would be possible. The change came-you did not seek it-and gradually I became more and more indifferent to you. Your affection for me died out, and even a desire on your part to rekindle once more that flame-had it been in your power to create such a desire-would have proved an unsuccessful effort. And yet my love for you rather increased than otherwise. I know not why or how it came that every thought of mine became your own. Day or night, asleep or awake, I saw my Hannah, sadly and reproachfully looking down upon me. I knew-I felt she was unhappy-and with that thought ever resting on my mind, my health began to fail me, and I sickened. What should I do to restore to her the smile that had fled from her soft downy cheeks? What measure should I adopt to bring joy once more to her soul? Such, among others, were my thoughts. I came to you, knelt down before you, and assured you of my love. This confession pained you. I could see it in your eyes; I could read it in your face. You could no longer return that love; your heart had ceased to beat for me. I returned to my room, and for the first time consulted the mirror. I saw how frail I had become Pale and sickly had grown my features, and my once erectly-held body had begun to stoop. I shook my head in sadness and wept. I knew that all was over with me now. My mind had ceased to charm you, my form had lost its beauty and elasticity. I had become unarmed. Your love, I felt, I could never more consider mine. 'Twas lost for ever. Hard as that blow had fallen upon my heart, it was a mere passing pain compared to what I felt as I thought of you, my Hannah, and the lifeless, loveless future that would be yours by the side of a husband whom you could not love. It was this that pained me most. You were still young and beautiful, endowed with the feelings and passions peculiar to youth and health. I knew the time would-must arrive, when the love I could not keep awake for me, another would sooner or later arouse for himself. I saw it, Hannah, pondered over it, and shuddered at the consequences. A slave to one man, bound to him forever, and to love another! I knew that woman must love, married or single, and, horrible as the truth flashing across my mind has been, I would not deceive myself with the belief that you, honest, virtuous and proud, as you are, would be an exception to a rule to which we all are subordinated. You are destined to love some one. How miserable-how unendurably miserable-would have become your existence, dear Hannah, had I stayed in Cincinnati, an irremovable obstacle between you and happiness! Think you that I could have endured to see your tears and heard your sighs? No, my wife, no. 
                              I left you. You are free again. I know not what the world will say to my departure, and I care not. It will, as a matter of course, attach, as it rightly should, all blame on me. Leave it thus. The hight of my ambition is to see you happy, to bring about which I took, after due consideration, this step. You can advance any excuse for my departure that will enlist the sympathy of the community on your side. You will soon forget me, and in the society of others become happy again. 
                              Before I left you I begged you to teach my son to love his father. It was a selfish motive of mine that prompted such a request. Why should my poor boy hear aught of me? It would simply make him sad and wretched. No, Hannah, let him grow up in total ignorance of his father's name and fate; I shall not complain, for I feel satisfied that ignorance in this particular will be bliss indeed. I shall leave on the first steamer for California, where I expect to end my days. Should you desire to write any thing to me previous to my departure, which will be on the 24th inst., you may address me at the "Prescott House." 
                              May you and your son be happy. May you soon forget me, and learn to love another who is more worthy than I. I shall remove, if it can be done, all obstacles that still like between you and future bliss. The next mail will bring you my consent, properly made out and signed, for a divorce, so that you can become free once more, if the law will permit such a thing. 
                              Now, a last farewell. I must not trust myself with more, for fear I should show a weakness I have labored thus far to keep back and conceal. 
                              Once more, good-bye. Be good to our little Emil. Forgive me for my past shortcomings, and kindly accept the only sacrifice that I could still make for their atonement. 
                              
                                 Yours 
                                 EDGAR ARMHOLD.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Broadwell still looked upon the letter after he had done reading it. He saw in every line, in every word the nobility of Edgar's magnanimous soul. No whining, no crinching; but a manly, dignified tale had been told here. Nothing soft and sentimental, but the stern reality calmly discussed. A smile came once more over the Reverend gentleman's features, as he thought over the ease with which he hoped to increase his influence over Hannah. 
                  He rose from his chair and deposited this letter in his desk, then took a sheet of note-paper, and, after thoughtfully gazing at the ink-stand, commenced to write a few lines. This done, he folded the paper up and put it in an envelope, which he addressed- 
                        EDGAR ARMHOLD, ESQ., Prescott House, New York City.
                     
                   
                  Ten minutes later he had deposited the letter in the post-office, and was entering a street-car on his return. 
                  But what was Hannah doing all this time? Let us call on her, reader, and like many of our acquaintances who only show their faces when they are least welcome, give her the pleasure of our presence, when least prepared to receive it. 
                  We find her in her own room, seated before a low fire burning in the grate-Jane, her favorite servant, standing by her side. 
                  "Miss Hannah"-the girl still called her by her maiden name-"Miss Hannah, how shall I dress our little Emil to-day?" 
                  Mrs. Armhold did not answer. Perhaps she had not heard the remark, or, having heard it, thought it insufficient in importance to waste a word upon. At all events she remained silent. Her head was resting on her right hand, and she was thoughtfully watching the expiring embers. Having waited several moments without eliciting a reply, the servant drew still nearer and ventured to repeat the question, only in a louder tone. It had the desired effect. Hannah raised her head, and that quickly, as if she had been aroused from a trance. She looked confused, and, passing her left hand across her forehead, suffered her eyes to wander around the room, until she at last fixed them upon her servant's face. 
                  "What's been the matter with me?" she asked in a faint voice. 
                  "I trust nothing, Miss Hannah," replied Jane. "I presume you have been asleep, and my voice startled you-that's all." 
                  Hannah dropped her head and breathed a sigh. 
                  "Where am I?" she inquired. 
                  Jane was just about to reply, when her mistress once more raised her pale, thoughtful face, and continued: 
                  "Has no letter been brought here yet this morning?" 
                  "No, ma'am." 
                  "Go to the post-office, Jane. The Eastern mail must be distributed by this time. If you find a letter for me hurry home with it. Do you hear me? Don't stop at every other house, and don't talk with every other girl you may meet on the way." 
                  "Miss Hannah, I have just come back from the post-office. There is no letter for you." 
                  "Perhaps the Eastern mail wasn't in yet." 
                  "I inquired, Miss Hannah, and I was told that the Eastern mail was in and distributed." 
                  Now Hannah rose from her seat, breathed another sigh, and began to pace up and down the room. "You can go down-stairs now," she said to the faithful Jane, who was about to withdraw, when she once more thought of the question she had put to her mistress, and was still unanswered. Therefore, when she had come to the door, she hesitated and turned around, saying: 
                  "Miss Hannah, how shall I dress our little Emil to-day?" 
                  Mrs. Armhold stopped; both anger and impatience were written on her face. 
                  "Haven't I told you a thousand times," she said, hurriedly, "not to ask me so many questions when I don't feel like speaking? Do as you like, and don't bother me." 
                  With a crestfallen face, Jane noiselessly retired from the room. Hannah recommenced her walk, but, before she had gone four paces, turned around and rushed to the door. 
                  "Jane!" 
                  The girl came back. 
                  "Jane," said her mistress, in that soft, conciliatory tone she was accustomed to use, whenever she knew herself wrong, to her faithful servant, "Jane, dress Emil in his new suit of green." 
                  "Shall I go out with him?" 
                  "If it is not too cold, yes." 
                  "Any thing else, ma'am?" 
                  Almost a minute elapsed before Hannah answered. 
                  "Yes, Jane," she said, once more seating herself, and looking into the fire. "Yes, I want to ask you a question or two, which, I hope, you will answer me without the least reserve. Tell me what do you hear about Mr. Armhold's absence? I mean, what do the servants about the house, your acquaintances, say of it?" 
                  Jane hesitated. Her face and her twitching betrayed her great embarrassment. Hannah was not slow to discover it. She turned pale and her lips began to tremble. 
                  "Don't be afraid. Tell me all! Tell me the truth, the truth, Jane-for God's sake, the truth," Hannah shrieked, rising from her chair, and grasping the trembling servant by the arm. 
                  "Miss Hannah," Jane stuttered, "the people are mighty wicked-" 
                  "Tell me, tell me!" 
                  "They say such horrid things-" 
                  "What horrid things, Jane?" she exclaimed still louder, almost maddened by being kept in suspense so long. "What horrid things? Can't you tell me at once and be done?" 
                  "Miss Hannah-" 
                  "Well-" 
                  "They say-" 
                  "Go on, go on, for God's sake, go on-" 
                  "They say-O, I can't tell-" 
                  "Go on, go on-" 
                  "They say," Jane now blubbered out, "Mr. Armhold ran off with some woman." 
                  "O, God!" and Hannah lay prostrate before her servant's feet. 
                  We may safely assert-and we scarcely ever assert any thing with a positiveness, for we are as liable to a wrong judgment, however high an enstimation we may hold of our own caliber, as our neighbor-yes, we may be bold to say, that of all the passions implanted planted in our bosoms, none has a stronger hold on us than that of "Love." We repeat it again, and, in doing so, would simply inform the intelligent reader that we have little reference to that sickly sentiment of the unbearded youth and of maidens arrived at the period of pubescence, although, it, too, is an effect of that passion, but speak of that peculiar, undefinable yearning, which, from infancy to the latest day of our life, makes us seek and find in other things and other persons a joy, and at times, an ecstacy, without which, we could not exist, or if we could, would make and keep that existence barren of that interest which spurs us on to actions, be they for good or for evil, and would make us selfish, isolated beings, without aim, ambition or enterprise. We know the power of envy, malice, hatred, revenge, and all their kindred spirits, and can bear testimony to the fact that, though few of the human family are entirely free from their influence, yet no single individual has been totally and continually swayed by either one or more of these passions. To-day we envy, to-morrow we hate, and the third day we take revenge, and on the fourth we neither envy, hate, nor take revenge: we are no longer impelled to action by those passions. Is it so with "Love?" We must answer it in the negative. Could we look into ourselves, and come back to the primitive motive of every thing we do, and have done, we should arrive at the conclusion that "love" is at the bottom of every thing, that it impels us to, and regulates, all our actions, and that all other passions, such as hate, envy, malice, revenge, etc., are not only not co-eval with it, but are simply its offsprings, subordinated to, and moved by, its ungovernable, ungoverned and all-pervading power. Such is love and its sway. And were we asked now, whether all beings are controlled by that passion, and whether we believe it the impelling force to all our actions, we should answer both in the affirmative, and, among other things, advance this reason, which, to our opinion, is of sufficient weight to give it our kind and unbiased consideration, namely, that, since carnal enjoyment is the rightful offspring of love, containing all its essence, and since through that offspring, and only through it, the human family, and each individual part thereof, is brought into existence-since through it the generative power receives vitality and is set in motion, therefore we may reasonably infer the created thing to be infused and most pervaded by that spirit which fathered it, in fact, which is the spirit itself only enlarged and transfused, and which received its first spark, vitality and life through its mysterious workings, and consider all other passions, if any be inherited, only co-relative thereto. 
                  Hence, since love is part of ourself, the wound it may receive through one, or a combination of causes, must, more or less, as the nature may be, prove fatal to our happiness, and, therefore, to our existence. 
                  That Hannah still loved Edgar can scarcely be doubted by those who understood her character and her disposition. It is true that she had grown cool and undemonstrative-that she had even gone so far as to deny to herself the existence of any affection for him, and, for aught we know, might have remained under that delusive impression for years to come, had not that single remark of her servant, namely, that Mr. Armhold had run off with another woman, awoke in her bosom, and made her conscious of the old passion, but with an effect upon her so different in its feelings, that all the reasoning in the world, had any been offered to her, could not have convinced her that it was one and the same passion, namely "Love," in a new guise. 
                  JEALOUSY! GREEN-EYED JEALOUSY! The strongest, mightiest passion that sways the human heart! Jealousy! Love, in all its strength, grown blind and giving birth to doubts and fears to perplex the mind, gnaw on the heart, and make of us a martyr or a demon! 
                  Jane had, by one thoughtless remark, transformed that passion, and in Hannah's mind crawled scorpions. Love, upon which she had fed, would, from this time forth, feed on her. Horrible! There she lay-upon the floor-these terrible words still ringing in her ear. She had swooned. No. The effect had been quite different. It had stayed-so to use the expression-the working of her mind for a moment, making her look with her mental eye at the picture mentally presented to that eye. But upon her body it had had, as we have seen, a different result. It had deprived it of all its strength and motion, and, owing to the sudden withdrawal of both, she had fallen upon the floor. 
                  After the expiration of a moment, she drew a long, painful breath. In the next moment the faithful Jane was kneeling by her side, looking down upon that sad face, whose pale lips and watery eyes frightened her, and were so strongly appealing for that sympathy she knew, were she to offer it, would be haughtily spurned by her who was so greatly in need of it. 
                  "Some water, please." 
                  Jane helped her mistress to rise, placed her upon the nearest chair, then hurried off to get some water. 
                  "Here," and the servant, no less pale and far more frightened than her mistress, was again by her side, and was holding out to her, in her trembling hand a glass of water. 
                  Hannah scarcely wetted her lips with it. In a feeble voice, she said to Jane to set the glass near by, then to go down-stairs. 
                  With eyes searching the floor and her head lowered upon her bosom, Jane moved across the room and through the door, into the hall outside. 
                   
                  Now Hannah was alone. There she sat upon that chair, and still in the very same position into which she had been placed by her servant. Her hands were "loosely" lying on her lap; her head was languidly hanging forward, and her eyes, which were widely opened, looked with a blank, unmeaning look at a black, waving streak running right in front of her, through the carpet, under her feet. What wat she doing? Was she thinking? No! no! Jealous people never think, though there are no minds more busy than those controlled by that passion, and Hannah, without knowing it, was jealous. She did not reason with herself-did not inquire whether there was a cause or foundation for jealousy, simply because she knew not as yet-as we have remarked before-that she was really under its baneful influence. But even if she had known it, the effect would have been all the same. The most unreasonable being on earth is a jealous woman. Mental darkness fills her whole mind, the wholesome light is expelled, and from each word, mien and look she feeds that worst of passion, until it completely masters her. 
                  For nearly an hour Hannah sat there, now and then gently compressing her thin pale lips and drawing long breaths. For the first time in her whole life she was truly miserable. There was something gnawing on her heart-she could not define the feeling precisely-but it was as if some one were "drawing in" her breath, leaving her just enough to make her feel that she hadn't sufficient to sustain life, and still too much, too much, to hurry on death. 
                  Hannah was literally dead. The blow had been struck, and she was helpless, aimless, ambitionless; and such people are dead, or worse than dead, for they are cursed with power to look into and be conscious of their own misery. She was entirely benumbed, mentally as well as physically. 
                  Yes, Hannah, for the first time in her life, felt really unhappy. Had Edgar scolded, cursed or whipped her; had he taken her from a palace and confined her in a dingy, disreputable hole; had he disgraced her, and brought poverty and starvation upon her; had he cast her from him and shut the doors against her-had he done all this and more, HANNAH PRESTON could and would have borne it, however deep the wound it inflicted might have been, with that pride and outward show of indifference she had inherited from her mother, and, which, until now, had never forsaken her. But Edgar had done worse-worse much worse-worse than any thing else that he could have been accused of. He had been guilty of loving another beside his wife. She doubted now whether he ever had loved her. O, how her heart ached now! Edgar loving another! Never in the world would that thought have entered her mind, but now 'twas there, and the whole world could not have removed it. Cause or no cause-it was there. 
                  She rose from her seat and moved toward the window, where she spent a moment or two looking along the street. Then she recrossed the room, and hearing steps in the hall, opened the door just in time to see one of the girls pass along. As the girl came opposite to where her mistress stood, she said "Good morning," and looked into Hannah's face, then moved onward. Hannah, after closing the door, retraced her steps and threw herself upon the sofa, covering up her face with her hands, and began to weep. Doubt and fear, the two scorpions in her mind, had read in the servant's mien and speech-what in reality no one else would have read there-the knowledge of the rumor Jane had brought to her. "She knows it, too; she knows it, too," she sobbed. "It is no longer a secret. Even the servants about the house have a mysterious look about them and shun my presence." 
                  In this manner she continued for several minutes, nor stopped she sobbing until footsteps once more were heard in the long hall. Quickly she dried her tears, then placed herself in front of the mirror. Her eyes had grown red from weeping. This would not do. No one should know that she had wept. Had there been no other motives for concealing this fact, her Pride would have prevented her from exposing that weakness. No! No one should see that she had wept. 
                  On a small table stood a glass of water Jane had brought to her. Hannah Armhold approached that table, poured some of the water over her handkerchief, then washed her eyes. The red hue gradually disappeared. 
                  Now she crossed the room and passed through the door into the hall. The same girl who had bid her "Good morning," was just approaching her from the opposite direction. 
                  A moment later they were face to face. 
                  "What are you staring at me for?" remarked Hannah, sharply, at the same time raising her head haughtily, and intently looking into the poor girl's eyes. 
                  "Excuse me, ma'am," the girl ventured to say, but scarcely above a whisper. "I'm not staring at you; I'm sure I'm not." And she was about to pass along. 
                  "Now don't tell me a story," Hannah quickly answered, still keeping her eyes upon the frightened girl, who could not account for the strange conduct of her mistress. "You have been staring at me. What do you know? Tell me all about it-every thing, every thing; do you hear me?" 
                  The girl trembled from head to foot. She couldn't imagine what her mistress wanted to know of her. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold, I don't know any thing; indeed I don't;" and the girl lowered her head to conceal her embarrassment. 
                   
                  "You don't?" was Hannah's mocking reply. "Look up!" The servant did so. "I can see it in your face, in your tell-tale eyes," she continued, "that you know it. Why not speak, if I request it? Don't need to be afraid. Come, tell me what is the rumor?" 
                  Again the poor girl protested that she knew nothing, and had heard of no rumor. 
                  "Go!" said Hannah, after a short pause, then slowly returned to her own room, where she threw herself upon a chair, and once more began to weep. Her face was still buried in her hands, when the door noiselessly opened, and a boy of something like two summers rushed-as well as boys of that age can rush-in the door and toward his mother. It was little Emil, Edgar's and Hannah's only child, dressed in his new suit of green, now proudly exhibiting it before his mother. 
                  "Mamma," lisped the little one, with the accent on the first syllable, "look a' my dress-nice-ain't it nice?" And he turned around so she could get a good view of it. 
                  Hannah raised her eyes and looked down upon the happy boy. There was a peculiar vagueness, absent-mindedness about her look, as if she had been disturbed from a dream which was still hovering over her mind. Her face was calm and meaningless, and not a muscle stirred to awake the slumber of those features. Little thought she at this moment of her boy; little cared she for his dress. 
                  "Mamma," he continued, after taking a turn, and approaching his mother, "ain't it nice? Ain't it?" And he took her hand. 
                  "Go away!" Mrs. Armhold rose to her feet and led the boy from the room, then returned once more to her seat. 
                  But not to weep. Her eyes remained dry, and, as they steadily were directed toward the opposite wall, one, had any one been there to notice them, would have supposed them deeply engaged in deciphering something written upon that wall. In the mean time, little Emil was slowly walking along the hall, crying at the top of his voice. Hannah, at any previous time, would have hastened to her little boy's side, whom she dearly loved-though he was the very image of his father-to conciliate him and coax him into good humor again. But now-and she must have heard the tremendous noise he made-she did not stir. She had lost all interest in him also. She was busy thinking-confusedly brooding over nothing-and would not suffer any thing to disturb her. 
                  Just then the house-bell rung. It had the effect to arouse her at once to a state of wakefulness. She raised her head, and glanced from wall to wall, with widely-opened eyes, as if she just had awakened from a dream and knew not where she was, then rose and hurried across the room, stationed herself before the mirror for one minute, and in the next returned to her seat. 
                  Jane entered. 
                  "Miss Hannah," she said, "Mr. Broadwell is below." 
                  "I shall be down presently." 
                  Jane retired. Now Hannah rose for the second time, and for the second time stationed herself before the mirror. Her eyes were still red. What should she do? Go down stairs and leave the sign of weeping on her face? No! Though Mr. Broadwell had more than once seen her shed tears, she would not if she could help it, betray her feelings this time. Again she applied cold water to her eyes, then opened the window and suffered the fresh morning air to play with her wan cheeks. It had the desired effect, her face assumed its naturally pale color. She withdrew from the window, and began, in slow measured paces, to walk up and down the room. Had she forgot that Mr. Broadwell was below? No! She knew it well enough, but was not yet quite ready to meet him. Should she, or should she not, inform him of the rumor Jane had brought her? This was the question she wasn't able to answer satisfactorily to herself. Being her pledged friend, he was entitled to know it from her lips, ere he should be made acqainted with it from the lips of strangers. But how could she do that? Was she not a woman? A wife? A mother? And had she no pride? No self-respect? No delicacy and sensitiveness? She had. How could she then inform a gentleman that her husband had deserted her for another woman? Did that not show, as plain as acts can show, that her husband had not been satisfied with her, and therefore had preferred another? Impossible! How could she speak of her own humiliation? Believing that her servants knew of the rumor, she had become ashamed to meet them. How should she be able to look now into the Reverend Doctor Broadwell's eyes, and tell him "my husband preferred another to me," and have him look down upon the discarded wife? No! She would conceal this fact from him. 
                  Had she known that the Reverend Doctor was the originator of that rumor, had caused it to be spread from one end of the city to the other, she would not have descended to the parlor, with the blind confidence in his honesty and friendship, which, as we shall shortly discover, became the source of untold miseries to her and to all those she loved. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XVIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              When this disease of jealousy can find, 
                              A way to seize upon a crazy mind; 
                              Most things, instead of help, or giving ease, 
                              The humor feed, and turn to the disease. 
                           
                         
                        SIR ROBERT HOWARD'S VESTAL VIRGIN. 
                      
                   
                  SHE found Broadwell seated at the table, and holding a small, gilt-edged volume in his hand, which was laid aside as soon as he saw Hannah enter. 
                   
                  "Good morning, Mrs. Armhold," he said, rising, a faint light passing over his serene features. "I have come to inquire into the state of your health. How are you, Madam?" 
                  In an unusually cold manner, and without looking into his face, she replied that she was well, after which she requested him to be seated, at the same time lowering herself upon a chair. 
                  "I am glad that you are well," he said, unobservedly scanning her features, "for I felt very uneasy since I heard, something like an hour ago, that you had been ill since yesterday." 
                  Now, for the first time, she raised her eyes to his face, which was as usual pensive and colorless. Yet, in her jealousy, she thought she could observe a change in its expression. 
                  "Who told you that I was in ill health?" she inquired rather sternly, a strange thought crossing her mind. 
                  "I heard it from Mr. Reuben Armhold, whom I met as I returned from the postoffice." 
                  It was a lie. He had not seen Reuben Armhold that morning, and if he had, would not have addressed him, as they were still strangers to one another, though he had made Hannah believe otherwise. 
                  "Heard it from Mr. Reuben Armhold?" And she lowered her head and fell into a short reverie. 
                  "I don't know what his object could have been in reporting you sick," Broadwell said, have aloud, as if speaking to himself, but, in fact, intending it for Hannah's ears. 
                  "How?" And she raised her head. 
                  "I simply remarked, that I don't know what Mr. Reuben Armhold's object could have been in reporting you sick, madam." 
                  "Can't you divine it?" And a bitter sneer curled her lips. 
                  "No." 
                  "No?" And still it is as plain as day," she continued, with more animation. "Yes, as plain as day. They want to make the world believe that I am an invalid, that I am now, and always had been, a frail, sickly creature. O, I understand their tricks;" and she bit her lips in anger-"O, I understand their tricks. But I shan't be sick, won't be sick-in spite of them I will be well and laugh, and go about to show that it is false-that it is a lie." In this manner she kept on for some time. 
                  She was too much excited to keep her seat. The passion of jealousy tormented her. The red blood came into her cheeks as she, in quick steps, walked half way across the room and back. 
                  "Though it may be as clear as day to you," Mr. Broadwell calmly said, "why he or they-though I do not know whom you include in "they"-should wish to report you an invalide, a constant sufferer, yet to me it is still a mystery, for I can't see what they are to gain by it." 
                  "Don't you see-don't you see," she commenced eagerly, then-checked herself. 
                  Broadwell had noticed that check. She was concealing something from him. He would have it. 
                  "Don't you see what-"he said, as if trying to help her along. "Don't you see what-" 
                  "Nothing." And she approached the window and looked into the street. She would not betray herself. She would not tell him the thoughts that jealousy implanted in her mind. "Sick indeed! Want to make the world believe that I'm an incapacitated, frail creature!" And her eyes brightened up and began to glisten like two crystals. "Is it not low enough to have run off with another woman? Is it not enough shame already? Must he even leave the impression, that I, I had deceived him in myself? Yes; was it not enough to disgrace me as he did, without leaving that impression? All the blame rolled from his shoulder over upon mine! By sacrificing me-his own wife! I sickly-an invalide! I God, it makes me mad to think of it!" 
                  A few minutes later she turned around and left the window. The fire had died out in her eyes, and the red hue had once more left her cheeks. A faintness came over her and she felt as if her feet were breaking under her. She sought her chair and gazed upon her visitor. She wondered whether he had also heard of the rumor Jane had brought to her. She thought it had not reached his ear. Why she arrived at that conclusion is not in our province to relate now. Suffice it to say, that she derived some consolation by the thought. 
                  "Was there no letter in the office for me?" she inquired in a faint voice, after a short pause. 
                  "I am sorry to say, 'no.'" 
                  "Are you certain that he is in New York?" she asked now, abruptly. 
                  "I am certain of it, Mrs. Armhold. You know, as I have told you before, a friend of mine met him on the streets there. He knows your husband well, and therefore would not be likely to take another for him." 
                  "Was he alone?" She put considerable stress on "alone," which did not escape the notice of her visitor. "What!" he thought, as he watched her eager expression. "Is it possible that the rumor has already reached her ear?" He smiled inwardly but his face was still serene. 
                  "If my memory serves me right," he said, with one finger on his forehead, "my friend did inform me that Mr. Armhold was accompanied by a young lady." 
                  This information did the work. It was a home thrust. A severe pang pierced her heart, and the little color that had still been left in her face now vanished. 
                   
                  There remained no longer the least doubt in her mind as to Edgar's guilt. That woman seen by his side could have been no other than the one with whom he had eloped from the city. 
                  "I have never heard him say," she commenced after a short pause, "that he had any lady acquaintances in New York. No, no," then more abruptly: "I wonder who she was and what he wanted with her?" 
                  Broadwell tried to evade this question, but in such a manner that she could not help but notice that he tried to evade it. He appeared not to have understood her, putting on an air of suppressed embarrassment, at the same time making a "quite out-of-the-way" remark. 
                  "He has heard the rumor, too," she said to herself, mentally; "he has heard the rumor, too, but wishes to spare my feelings." Then aloud: "Mr. Broadwell! what do you think of that lady-I mean the lady seen in Mr. Armhold's company?" 
                  "What?" And he slightly shrugged his left shoulder. "What? Indeed, I don't know what to think of her." 
                  PRIDE, the PRIDE and dignity of a lady of honor and station, which Hannah unquestionably was, counselled her to drop this subject, but jealousy, much the stronger passion, would not listen to its voice. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," she said, looking steadily into his eyes, "that woman was a bad woman." 
                  "Mrs. Armhold-" 
                  "-knows it all and so do you," she interrupted him, pointing her index finger straight at him. "Tell me, Mr. Broadwell, have you not heard of the rumor?" 
                  He drew his chair closer to hers, then said, gently taking hold of her hand, "Be comforted, Madam, God forsakes not the innocently suffering. I have heard of the rumor, but I can not believe it." 
                  With a well assumed delicacy he turned his face away from her. She saw it and was moved by it. A moment later she was in tears. Broadwell rose from his chair and seated himself close to the side-table, upon which several books were lying, one of which he now picked up. Hannah, unable longer to restrain her feelings, began to sob aloud. With her face buried in both her hands, she rocked herself to and fro. In the mean time Broadwell was turning leaf after leaf in the book he had picked up. His mind, however, was not in the occupation. He had come here upon business, and as matters stood now he could not well perform it. He laid the book aside and turned around. 
                  "Mrs. Armhold!" In a low confidence-inspiring tone. She raised her head and their eyes met; his, calm, and steady; hers swimming in tears. 
                  "Dry your eyes," he said, softly. 
                  It was done. 
                  He continued: 
                  "You are calm now, Mrs. Armhold. Let me speak to you. I do not believe in the truth of that rumor, nor shall I, before I have more relative proof. Your husband is not fallen quite so low, as thus to disgrace the mother of his own child. Let us do him the justice in disbelieving in that rumor, at least-" 
                  "O do not console me by holding out false hopes to me," interrupted Hannah, sorrowfully lowering and shaking her head. 
                  "It is not my desire," he continued in the same, low, artless strain, "to hold out false hopes to you. Believe me, Mrs. Armhold, your husband has honor, and would never take such a step, unless he were freed by law from the obligations due his wife. Had he desired and obtained a divorce previous to his departure, even then, though it were more probable, I should discredit such a rumor. A husband is a husband, and a father is a father. Mr. Armhold is both, and however inexcusable his conduct toward you has been, you do him wrong in believing this of him." 
                  Hannah lowered her head and fell in a brown study. O, how much would she have given to be able to banish jealousy and quiet her own mind upon this point. But it was a futile effort. Jealousy once roused never dies-and Broadwell knew it, else he would not have become the defender of Armhold's character. 
                  She looked up and heaved a long sigh. The sanctimonious-looking Broadwell met her sad gaze with a faint smile-a smile that inspired confidence and was calculated to mislead her. 
                  "Do not," he commenced softly, "I pray you, do not, my dear Mrs. Armhold, torment yourself with imaginary troubles. Disbelieve this rumor-banish it from your mind. You know I am your friend-your true friend. Would I instill hopes into your heart, that a future, an early future, might at once dispel? No, Mrs. Armhold; you know I would not. Therefore drive away this thought. I shall investigate this matter, and if I should find it true-if he should have eloped with another lady-" 
                  "Stop, for God's sake, stop!" she interrupted him, once more burying her face in her hands, and beginning to sob aloud. 
                  "You don't know how this torments me. I can't speak! I can't speak! O God! O God! O, O, O, O!" and the poor woman-the proud, haughty Hannah Preston-threw herself upon the floor and commenced to pluck out her hair. 
                  She was despairing. The wife and the mother had been outraged, and the heart was bursting. In the misery of the moment pride and haughtiness were forgotten, and she writhed under the sharp and biting lash of an unkind providence. 
                  "Rise!" exclaimed Mr. Broadwell, running ning to her side and lifting her from the floor. "In the name of all that's holy, rise and console yourself. If you keep on in this manner, you will not only make yourself unequal to the task before you, but will confirm the rumor to all who have heard it, and may come in contact with you. I thought you had more control over yourself, Mrs. Armhold," he continued in a milder strain, after he had once more conducted her to her seat, "Yes, I thought you had more control over yourself than to despond at once and give way to such a weakness. You are sorely tried-I know you are, but think, dear Madam, that few are the families who have no troubles-if even not of the same kind as yours-yet equally as great if not greater than those now tormenting you. I am a minister, an humble follower of Christ, the confident of many sorely-tried and deeply-wounded hearts. You-the world, dear Madam, looks on, and judges only by the exterior. How many do we envy in the course of our life, to whom, could we look into them and read them as they are and feel, we ought to give our unfeigned pity and sympathy, and with whom, were our own afflictions doubled and trebled, we would not exchange our lot for all the treasures Crsus owned. Therefore I say, dear Mrs. Armhold, console yourself. Think not that you alone are unhappy. Many, many do I know, who smile to the world while their hearts weep unseen. Not all is gold that glitters. Not all is happiness that wears a sunbeam on its brow. Trust in our Savior, and bear your cross in meekness. Then peace will come to your soul-" 
                  Hannah was moved to tears, and Broadwell ceased to speak. He crossed over to the window, and suffered her, unobserved and undisturbed, to unburthen, by weeping, her heavily-laden heart. A few minutes later, her eyes still red from weeping, and her voice grown somewhat hoarse, called the Reverend Doctor to her side. 
                  He drew his chair near hers, gently took hold of her hand, looked confidingly into her eyes, then said, scarcely above a whisper. 
                  "What can I do for you, sister? Speak unreservedly to me: I am your brother." 
                  She softly pressed his hand, and imploringly raised her tear-filled eyes to his pale, serene face. 
                  "Speak unreservedly," he repeated, returning, but respectfully, the gentle pressure of her hand. "I will serve you with my life." 
                  "Do you really believe he has not eloped with another?" she said, in an under tone, struggling to restrain herself from weeping. 
                  "Such is my opinion, Mrs. Armhold," Broadwell replied, suffering her hand to glide out of his own. 
                  "O, how cheerfully would I forgive him for every thing else, if he only be clear of this," she said, with considerable enthusiasm. "He has deserted me-it is a hard blow-I know it is, but I can survive it. I believe I could almost become happy again, were I assured that he had not preferred another to me. Will you-will you," she added, in a coaxing manner, "investigate this matter for me? I can't live with this doubt resting upon my mind. I am ashamed-O, do find out this thing for me-" 
                  She stopped. Somebody was in the hall, and approaching in the direction of the parlor. Both Mr. Broadwell and Hannah directed their eyes toward the door. Their hearts palpitated as if they were in the act of being caught in performing some heinous crime. 
                  The footsteps came nearer. Hannah rose, crossed the room and passed through the door. A moment later, Mr. Broadwell heard a faint scream and a stified voice in the hall, then all was silent. Even the dead echo of the footstep that had first attracted their attention, had died out. He turned pale, and an unusual fear took possession of his soul. He remained in a position of eager suspense for some time. Hannah did not return to him. He got up and passed out into the hall, but he could espy no one in its long passage. What could have become of Hannah! And who could have been the stranger? Broadwell could not tell, and the more he thought over it, the greater became his apprehensions. 
                  "I'll wait a moment," he said to himself, as he retraced his steps into the parlor, "before I shall depart from the house. She can not leave me here without returning to me, or without sending some excuse for her strange disappearance." 
                  And the Reverend Doctor was right. He had scarcely taken a seat before Jane appeared, notifying him of the impossibility of her mistress to prolong with him the interview of this morning. 
                  He said nothing in return. He only picked up his hat, bowed and passed out. Just as he was about to reach the outer door, he thought he heard a faint shriek-similar to the shriek he had heard a few minutes previous. 
                  He turned paler, buttoned up his coat, and stepped into the street. 
                  A half hour later he had himself announced at Mr. Montgomery's. 
                  It was during this visit that Doctor Broadwell became acquainted with Mr. Reuben Armhold; and when the former took his departure, after a stay of several hours, during which time the chief topics of the day had been discussed, the latter was seen to leave the house also, and both gentlemen walked side by side, neither speaking a word, until they had reached the first crossing, when Mr. Armhold, after clearing his throat with a forced cough, said: 
                  "Doctor, I should like to have some private conversation with you. It has been my constant wish from the first day of my return to the city to be introduced to you. Why and wherefore, I cannot tell you now. Let it suffice you, Doctor, that I shall be pleased to obtain you as a friend, and now, if no previous engagement claims you elsewhere, speak to you upon matters upon which I should like to have your opinion. Will you allow me to accompany you to your rooms?" 
                  "Most certainly, if it be your pleasure," remarked Broadwell in return. "Though we are as yet comparative strangers, still for years I had the honor of not only knowing but also of being a bosom friend of your brother. I shall esteem you on this account, until I have learned to love you for your own sake. I do not live a great distance from here. Let us strike up a brisker pace, and we shall shortly reach our destination." 
                  So saying they began to increase their speed. Little was spoken by either during this journey, and that little principally touching only the weather, season, etc. Nothing of importance was said until, a short time after, they were seated in Mr. Broadwell's room. What transpired there during that interview is for the present to remain unknown to our readers. However this much may be said, that when Reuben, after an hour's conference, took his departure, and was seen hurrying homeward, a bitter sneer could have been noticed to play on his lips, and a wicked smile-one that was speaking of having achieved a cherished purpose-to shoot from his deep black eyes. 
                  We shall now for a short season bid adieu to these characters, and to take flight to New York, in order to look after our hero, from whom we have heard very little, with the exception of the letter he had addressed to Hannah, and which had fallen, as we have seen, into Broadwell's hands, since his departure. 
                  We go at once to the Prescott House, ask for Mr. Edgar Armhold, are told the number of his room, have ourselves conducted into it, and find it unoccupied as we enter. Mr. Armhold is not in, but, judging by appearances-for the door of his room is unlocked-has not gone very far. 
                  We dismiss the servant and take a seat by the fire. Having warmed ourself, we rise and begin to pace up and down the floor. Tired of this, we approach the table upon which we espy something in the shape of an oblong book. We pick it up, and discover it to be the diary of our hero. We, in his absence, make bold to turn back several of its leaves, and commence our perusal with the following entry: 
                  "November 11.-I have written to Hannah, and my heart feels somewhat lighter. I did not think it possible that I had so great a control over my feelings. Who can, in perusing that letter, even imagine the tenth part of the agony it has cost me to write it? No one-not even Hannah. She will give it, at the utmost, one moment's thought, then banish it from her mind. 
                  "I have asked her to forgive me. Can she do it? Will she do it? Yes. I believe she can. I believe she will. Why do I weep now like a child? I weep because it makes me feel good. It strikes me, if I were to weep an hour or so each morning, I should feel happier during the remainder of the day. 
                  How wretched do I feel! Can I not for a moment forget my misery? O, Hannah! Hannah! little know you how my heart is aching! 
                  "I have walked up and down this room in order to outrun my sorrows, but they follow me from step to step. I wish I could shed some tears, but I can not. I feel a faintness in my heart and a heaviness in my brains. 
                  "I have just returned from a walk, and once more am seated before this table, with my diary opened, my pen at the top of a new leaf. What shall I write upon it? Some of the thoughts that are passing through my mind! 
                  "But how can I confide them to this book? Will I not blush to read them over after they are once written down? 
                  "No! What use is there of a diary at all if you give it but a part of your confidence? Why intrust any thing to paper if you do not wish a full and correct record? 
                  "'Tis folly, the height of folly to conceal any thing from one's self." 
                  "Here I sit, a broken-hearted, ambitionless being, struggling with myself to overcome myself. Constantly thinking of Hannah-my Hannah! Is it a weakness that I can't forget her? I presume it is, and yet it has so strong a hold on me, that, despite my mighty efforts to tear myself loose from it, it momentarily enslaves me more and more. 
                  "What would the world say to see me weep here? Would she believe it possible that Edgar Armhold, the novelist and poet, is the most miserable creature on earth? She would laugh at such a thought, and nevertheless it is true. I am miserable beyond expression. 
                  "O, Hannah! Hannah! how many tears have I already shed on your account! Why will not that feeling of love leave my breast as it has yours, and give me back my peace and happiness? Can there be any thing on earth to make us feel more wretched than to love with the whole heart and soul, with the whole strength of our nature-a being who is incapable of returning that love? No! LOVE rejected is LIFE destroyed! 
                  "I must change this theme. I have had my mind made up never to recur to it again, and, as much and soon as possible, to forget it. But now and then it will come back to me with a stronger force than ever. 
                  "I have said that I would write downsome of my thoughts, and I shall do it-if those that pass through my mind now will not obscure those that have already swept the same course. 
                  "I catch at one, and here it is-black on white. As I walked along the street, gazing upon so many strange, strange faces, and calmly considered that not one of them-nay, not a solitary one, took the least interest in me-I mentally discussed, for the first time in my life, (and I hope it will also be for the last time) the advantage and propriety of suicide. I don't know what brought that idea into my head-but there it was, and I pondered over it. Not that I defended suicide committed by any one under any circumstance-yet, as I viewed my own life, and the aimless, barren future that would, in all likelihood be mine-yes, as I viewed all this, and looked into my inner self and saw there my heart, my loving heart, bleeding, bleeding, bleeding its very life away, I must confess it, I, Edgar Armhold, who has been so bold as to write a code of morals for others-now is weak enough to excuse self-destruction, and almost to think-I say almost-whether it were not better if I, myself, were to commit suicide. 
                  "Thanks to the speedy transitions of thoughts! that thought at least is gone. 
                  "And yet, would any one who knew me and had seen me on the streets, have dreamed of what I was then thinking! No, not one; no more than I could have read what was passing in their minds. For aught I know, hundreds may have entertained very similar opinions! 
                  "Have I then really grown childish to be so much carried away by this grief? Or is it, perhaps, a lack of manliness, that I can't tear myself loose and rise above it? I can scarcely think so. I know I am a MAN, feel like one-such misery only men can endure. I have looked upon the gaunt face of poverty; I have witnessed outbreaks of rage and discontent; I have seen a father strike a mother, and a mother seek her couch whipped and half starved. More, much more. I have also seen that father become a paralyzed mute, and that mother-that good, good mother-a blind, frail, suffering invalid. Is it necessary to say how I felt at all these sights and vicissitudes? No, it is a superfluity. Every human being has felt more or less of these miseries. And yet all these combined-all-what are they when compared to the anguish of a broken and unloved heart? Nothing-decidedly nothing. 
                  "Rejected love contains the very quintessence of misery. There was a time I should have declared this an expression fit for an enthusiastic boy. I should have considered a man effeminate, weak in his mind, who could remain thus enslaved by one passion. But I know that I am not a boy, and that I can rise above much, much grief, and yet this love-this peculiar yearning-haunts me day and night-creates a very hell in my bosom-gnaws on my heart, claims each thought, and destroys my very life-blood, drop after drop. Hannah! Hannah! what have you done! What have you done! 
                  "I have taken a short walk up and down my room, and still feel no easier. I fear I never shall be well again. This grief will bury me. I have tried my best to forget it-but I can't. I must love on, I presume, to the end of my days. 
                  "What did I write here? 'To the end of my days?' And I am still on the right side of thirty! What a blank is my existence! O, Hannah! Hannah! why will you withhold from me your affections? What would I not give to have your love once more? 
                  "I have actually been weeping, but still this gnawing on my heart seems incessant. It will not stop. It will never, never stop. I know it, I know it, why should I deceive myself? I know this pain has a permanent lodgment in my bosom. Death can only remove it. I wish I could die now. 
                  "I am going to read; perhaps I shall feel better. 
                  "Have read for an hour, but my impatience is too great to let me read longer. Isn't it strange that I should have lost all appetite for enjoyments? And nevertheless it is so. I am going to read 'Manfred;' it just suits my depressed spirits. 
                  "Have read the first scene. It was as much as I could do to get through with it. I must walk up and down this room; to sit here is to die here. 
                  "I can't walk either. Have I really grown childish? womanish? Or have I lost my senses? I believe it must be the latter. No man, possessed of his wits, would be carried away in this manner. Yes, it must be the latter. 
                  "Edgar Armhold mad-crazy! I am not mad. I know I am not mad! Nor am I a child or woman! No, no-a thousand times 'no!' I am a man-every inch of me a man, for who but a man could endure all this misery! who but a man can feel as I do! I am destined to love-destined to love that woman, were she to curse me, I could not learn to hate her. Don't call it nonsense, for it is not nonsense. "That woman I must love." 
                  "I am not going to write any thing else. I think this entry is long enough. But before I close my diary, I am going to read over what I have written. 
                  "I have done so, and am glad that no one else but myself can look over this entry. I would be laughed at by the wicked, pitied by the benevolent, and by both would be thought a fit subject for an asylum. 
                  "I am going out to see the city; on my return I may, in all probability, add something new. 
                  "I have just returned from a 
                      
                        "FATHER," SHE SAID, "YOU LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER HANNAH?" 
                     
                     
                      long walk, in much quieter spirit and feeling much easier. If only this gnawing on my heart would cease! After tea I shall write a few lines to Mr. Montgomery; in the meantime-what shall I do?". I am more myself now, than when I wrote it. 
                  "I have read it over for the second time. Would any one believe that Edgar Armhold could have written this while in his right senses? And yet he did write it, and while he was in his right senses. 
                  "What do I hear? The supper bell. I shall go down stairs and drink a cup of coffee; I have no taste for any thing else this evening. Again at my diary. I have not written so long an entry for some time, and yet containing so little worth noticing. Had I not gone down to supper, in all probability I should have written the promised note to Mr. Montgomery, and then, without turning another leaf in this book, would have retired for this night. As it is, I have turned another leaf, and here I sit, to put down in black a partial record of the annoyances I have had to undergo since last I resigned this pen previous to my going below to supper. When I had entered the dining-room, I found something like a dozen faces looking up from their plates, over which they had been greedily bending, and mercilessly began to stare at me. For the moment I felt somewhat embarrassed, not knowing how to account for this conduct. But soon I attributed it to my looks-for I knew the effects of this day's self-torture-had not been lost on my face. So I took the first seat I found vacant, ordered a cup of coffee, drank it, then rose for the purpose of quietly returning to my room. But in the hall I was stopped by one of the gentlemen who had noticed both my entrance into, and exit from, the dining-hall. 'Excuse me, sir-are you not Mr. Armhold?' he said, stationing himself right in front of me. After I had nodded assent, still without removing himself from my path, he continued: 'I should be happy, indeed, sir, to cultivate your personal acquaintance. I had no sooner read your name in the register, than I was determined to see, and, if possible, to have speech with you.' I was just about to excuse myself from any further detention, when two other gentlemen came alongside of us, and also stopped in front of me. But before I could do so-for I had suffered a pause to intervene-my new acquaintance again had the word. 'I've had the pleasure of perusing many of your works,' he said, not dreaming of the uncomfortability of my being kept there, 'and often wondered at the truth and skill displayed in your portraiture of human nature. Now, Mr. Armhold, do not think that I flatter you. I have been quite carried away with your writings. It touched my heart, sir, for it spoke to the heart. Therefore, I made so bold as to address you, for I am always proud to cultivate the acquaintance of scholars.' Then abruptly, 'Will you suffer me to introduce myself? My name is-' Just then four other gentlemen arrived and surrounded me. Before my versatile friend had had time to give me his name, he found himself pushed aside, which would have been a relief to me, had I now been allowed to quietly pursue my way. But this was not the case. The foremost of the new comers, and who had stationed himself right before me, now took the word. He said he hoped that I would excuse the liberty he was taking in thus introducing himself. But he and these gentlemen with him had come to tender me an invitation to a feast which were to be given to morrow evening, in honor of myself, by my many admirers in the city, who had only heard, some thing like an hour ago, of my arrival. I don't know, at any other time I should have been pleased at such a demonstration, but now-I can't account for it-it actually irritated me-me, who had not suffered myself to be irritated for many long, long years. I answered them, I fear, rather ungallantly, and told them that I felt not well enough to prolong this interview, but should be pleased to let them know to-morrow morning, whether I can accept of their kind invitation or not. After some few other remarks of these friends, many of whom offered me the hospitality of their homes, they departed-satisfied of having seen me. 
                  "I am glad that I have escaped them. They mean well, no doubt, and do not know of my grief. They know not that praise to me is henceforth a hollow sound. That I am dying inch by inch. 
                  "I have changed my mind. I shall not write to Mr. Montgomery until I have an answer from Hannah. Now I will read 'Manfred' until I become sleepy. Perhaps I may rest better after reading myself tired. 
                  "November 12-Three o'clock.-I have just come back from making some purchases and from visiting the steamer in which I am to sail for California. During my absence (so the clerk of this hotel told me) a gentleman requested to see me, and, having been informed that I had gone out some two hours ago, from which trip I had not yet returned, he left a note in the office for me, which, immediately after my return, came into my possession. I have just got through reading it. It is as I expected-or rather as I apprehended-from the committee that had called on me last evening, tendering me an invitation to a feast to be given, in honor of me, this evening, and to which I had promised to send an answer. 'The committee,' so ran the note, 'begs to be informed whether or not I could do my friends the honor, and give them the pleasure, of my company this evening, at the residence of Mr. Elliot. They hoped that I would accept the invitation, promising me to do all in their power to make me spend the few hours as agreeably as possible in their midst. Should I however feel still indisposed (which circumstance they would deeply regret both on my account as well as on their own) they begged me to name the day most convenient to me, and they would make the arrangements accordingly,' etc. 
                  "My mind is made up; in fact, it was made up last evening, and I might have given them an answer then just as well as now. I must decline this invitation, and shall at once send them a note to that effect. I am not fit to show myself in society. No! My grief is too deep, and has too strong a hold on me, to let me relish the company of strangers, however great their efforts may be to please me. My mind would be absent; my heart would be absent; it would only have the effect to remind me still more of my own isolation and loneliness, even without leaving me the satisfaction of having been able to add, in the least, to furthering the sociality and enjoyment of those who had assembled for the purpose of honoring me. I know my presence would only tend to throwing a damper on the whole affair. And what right have I, if I feel myself not fit for society, to enter it? None! None, and therefore I shall not go. I have no right to thrust myself upon others while I am in this state of mind. 
                  "Four o'clock, P. M.-I have been sitting here over two hours thinking of the Past-my Past. I have called back to my mind first the scenes of my childhood, then those of my boyhood, and then again those of my more riper years, and, in so doing, have experienced a peculiar kind of pleasure I had not anticipated in this retrospection. When I calmly reflected over all those disadvantages through which I had to labor; when I looked back to those days when I was the only support of a helpless father and a no less helpless mother-the former having been dumb, the latter blind; when I thought of their trouble-encumbered lives and their untimely and tragic deaths; when I remembered all those trials and my forlorn, unenviable and friendless life; and when I pondered over the harsh treatment I had received at the hands of strangers until I had secured a seat in the temple of fame; when I thought over all this, and at last suffered my mind to call up the thousand agonies I have had to experience since Hannah had ceased to love me, I must confess my spirit rose within me and made those tears, that had in the mean time gathered in my eyes, more those of pleasure than of pain. I have learned to love all mankind by this retrospection. It has imparted to me a lesson I shall labor never to forget. It has taught me never to judge by appearances. Who, by looking at me, or by reading my works, or even by having the advantage of my company, would arrive at the conclusion that I had suffered all this and more? Who would believe that under this cold, calm exterior of mine, a heart is gradually wearing my life away? Who would? Nobody! 
                  "How many are there on earth, more wretched than I, and perhaps equally as skillful to conceal it! How often do we turn away from misery, simply because we deny our neighbors the same share of feeling we ourselves possess? We see a poor, illiterate man insulted by the rich; we see the common, hard-featured laborer follow his offspring, without pomp or show, to a grave dug in an obscure cornor of the poor's last resting-place, without enlisting our sympathy; we see the raggedly-clothed but honest woman, scarcely recognized by the companions of her youth and of her better days; we hear of some others who have courted vice and have followed evil paths, and we at once turn our shoulders to them, forgetting in the brief moment of our own exultation and giddiness how far we are from being perfect, and how near they are to despair. How often do we find the warmest sentiments, the truest hearts, the most faithful friends, among those whose natures, whose very looks will not, can not publish to the world their own anguish! 
                  "I pondered over all this, and a soothing calm stole over my spirit. I thought kindly of my neighbors-of the whole world. Why should I hate those who wrong me, or why should I wrong those who hate me? How silly and thoughtless is man to be guilty of either? 
                  "I can not hate, I can not wrong another. Some call this cowardice-effeminacy. I call it meekness and forbearance. The deeper my sorrows, the warmer my heart. I can not hurt a viper when I am grieved. I simply feel like weeping and withdrawing from the world. 
                  "Yes. I still have an aim in life. I shall seek out the poor and the afflicted, and teach them to rise above their misery. No greater mission could be mine. To spread happiness over the sunless home of the sorely tried; to cheer the drooping spirit; to help the fallen to rise; to keep others from falling; to judge error with leniency; to speak gently to all and give them all my love any sympathy, shall in the future be my mission.
                   
                  "Half-past four o'clock P. M.-My lawyer has just left me. He brought me the documents I ordered him yesterday to make out for me. It is my consent to have a divorce. Whatever wrong I may have committed in marrying Hannah, I believe I have acted nobly in making this last sacrifice. I have but to sign this paper, and she is free again as the bird in the air. And I shall sign it. I trust the lawyer is not deceiving me. I have heard that divorces are not easily allowed. 
                  "'Tis done. The last bonds are severed. From this day forth Hannah is no longer my wife. Emil! Emil! my dear, dear boy, may you be happier than your father. 
                  "Five o'clock P. M.-Back from the post-office. On the 16th of this month Hannah will be in possession of this document; on the 24th I shall leave for California. I wonder whether she will bid me a last farewell. The letter would have plenty of time to reach me if she were inclined to write-O, foolish, foolish thought! Why still cling to hope when hope long since is dead? Had Hannah loved me it would never have gone so far. 
                  "Seven o'clock P. M.-I have been coughing considerably more to-day than I have done for weeks. I have caught a severe cold since my arrival in this city. If I should not feel any more relieved by to-morrow, I shall find it necessary to consult a physician in regard to my lungs. 
                  "Half-past eight o'clock P. M.-Have supped. Shall now retire, for I feel unusually weary and sleepy this evening. Perhaps I can fall asleep. 
                  "November 14th-One o'clock P. M.-How frail and weak is man! Where is his boasted superiority? A cold wind touches him, and lo! the man of strength and daring grows as feeble and helpless as the smallest child, and far more miserable. I have not left my bed since yester-morn, and I feel as it I never more were to rise from it. What if I should die? O mother! O, father! will I ever meet you again? Will I see those faces once more that fondly looked down upon me-O, how often! O, father! O, mother! none but those who lost ye know how to appreciate your disinterested love. 
                  "November 15th.-My physician has just left me. He pronounced me, and I feel, much better. After taking my breakfeast I shall take a short stroll. 
                  "Have returned from a walk through some of the principal streets in this great metropolis. Have seen and observed many faces. What a study for man! Where is the book that has described joy or misery as plainly as the hand of Nature has written them in the human face? And still we close our eyes and remain in darkness. We only think of ourselves, little caring for the world besides. We even know not-so much are we engrossed with the thought of 'self'-how singularly unfeeling we have grown. In the busy stir of life; in our vanity to have the eyes of man turned upon us in admiration; in our desire to gain power, influence and notoriety, we forget the essential duties imposed on us. We lose that interest in our neighbors we should have in them. How cold is our greeting! How insincere our professions! We smile and smile; we shake hands and are loud in laudation of one or the other; but O! that feeling of love, that hearty out-pouring of a soul that can find something divine in every man-even in the vilest criminal-we search for in vain. I have learned to think that sympathy for our kind and in our kind is dead. Were it not for the parents' love for their own offspring, we might safely expunge the word 'love' from our vocabulary, for the use we'd have for it. The child does no longer love its parents, nor the brother the sister, nor the sister the brother, nor one being another. All's show and pretension-signifying nothing. The world's grown wise, and hypocrisy plays a most important part. As I walked along, and beheld among the thousands hurrying to and fro, with what a marked indifference even friends (as their remarks led me to believe them to be) greeted one another, I could not help but think that the misanthrope is the honest man, and Joseph Joseph-father Joseph-a God! 
                  "November 16th-I am entirely restored to health again, and were it not for that inner pain, I believe I should feel happy. But that inner pain, 'tis that-'tis that. I believe I am homesick. What would I not give now just to have a glimpse of my wife and my boy?. I must drive this thought away. 
                  "November 17-Nine o'clock A. M.-I have had a restless night; I don't believe that I slept much over an hour altogether. Try as I will, this old feeling comes back on me. I have a good mind to pack up, go back to Cincinnati, and throw myself before Hannah's feet. All the philosophy of the whole world can not make me forget that I love her. I have deceived myself long enough. My existence is warbed in hers-to extricate me from her is to kill me. Yes, I'm going to pack up after I have come back from the steamer. I shall notify the captain that I will not sail on the 24th. 
                  "Half-past eleven o'clock.-Not in one moment like in the other. I have just returned from the steamer, but not for the purpose of packing up in order to turn back to Cincinnati. Such a proceeding would simply make me ridiculous in Hannah's eyes. I shall stay here. I have still some hopes. Perhaps my dear wife will repent and call me back to her side. Perhaps she will say that she loves me after all, and has only been mistaken in her own feelings. Yes, I shall wait, patiently wait, for an answer. Hannah will repent; Hannah will call me back to her side. 
                  "There is some one approaching my door. He is now knocking for admittance. I can't imagine who it can be, as I left instructions in the office below to send no strangers into my room. 
                  "It was the porter. He handed me this letter. Let me see the post-mark. 'Cincinnati.' I haven't the courage to open it. It is a strange handwriting. Would I knew its contents! 
                  "Some one approaching again. * * * It is the self-same messenger, informing me that a gentleman solicits a brief interview with me in the reception-room. I shall go down-stairs; on my return I shall have more courage to peruse this letter." 
                  Here the diary broke off. Let us lay it back upon the table, and await the return of our hero. 
                  He came at last and seated himself before the half-extinguished fire. For several minutes he looked absently at the yellow flames. Now and then a sigh would escape his lips, which looked parched and dry. "The letter," he whispered to himself, then arose and sat down before the table. After once again looking over the last entry he had made, he closed up the diary and then-broke the seal of the letter, postmarked "Cincinnati," and read its contents. 
                  Few lines! only a few lines! But fifteen minutes had elapsed and still his eyes were on them. 
                  Never before was he paler-never before looked he sadder. 
                  A sigh-a long, long-drawn sigh-followed by a shower of tears. Edgar could no longer control himself. That letter had unmanned him. He laid his head upon the table and sobbed aloud. "All's dark to me now; would that I could die!" he cried aloud, almost despairing. 
                  The wildest storm passes off; so did this. It took Edgar only a few minutes to become composed again. He raised his sad, pale face, and as he did so, a soft, vague smile stole gradually over his features, and a mild light of suffering and resignation shone from his deep black eyes. 
                  On the table was a small bell. He rung that bell, which sent its echo through the hall, and brought the porter to his door. 
                  "Any thing wanted?" inquired the latter. 
                  "My bill, and some one to take my trunks down stairs." 
                  "You are not going to leave us?" continued the servant. 
                  "I am, sir. Have the kindness to attend to my orders." 
                  The porter departed, and as he did so, Edgar opened his diary, turned a new leaf, and wrote thereon the contents of that most fatal note. 
                  An hour after a carriage was seen to leave the Prescott House. 
                  It contained EDGAR ARMHOLD. 
                  Broadwell had done his work well. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XIX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              The flying rumors gathered as they rolled, 
                              Scarce any tale was sooner heard than told, 
                              And all who told it added something new, 
                              And all who heard it made enlargement too, 
                              In every ear it spread, on every tongue it grew. 
                           
                         
                        POPE'E TEMPLE OF FAME. 
                      
                   
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Curse the tongue 
                              Whence slanderous rumor, like the adder's drop, 
                              Distills her venom, withering friendship's faith, 
                              Turning love's favor. 
                           
                         
                        HILLHOUSE. 
                      
                   
                  THE footsteps Mrs. Armhold had heard in the hall on the morning of her last interview with Broadwell, were those of her brother Newton, who had returned on the previous night from an European tour, after an absence of several years. At first she did not recognize him, but as he gradually approached her and called her name, she knew who it was that addressed her, and the faint scream, that had been heard by Broadwell in the drawing-room and had made him feel so uneasy, was the scream which had escaped from her lips. 
                  "Brother! brother!" she exclaimed in a stifled voice, "I am so glad you have returned." And she took him by the arm and led him up-stairs. She did, however, not pass with him through the hall, but entered a room to the left, from which a pair of stairs led to the second story. 
                  The usual greeting being passed, Newton Preston, to the great astonishment of his sister, rose from his chair and seated himself by her side on a small settee, remarking: 
                  "Hannah, I have returned last night from a long journey. When I left for Europe several years ago, there was no stain upon the name of Preston, and happiness reigned supreme at our parents' home. How is it now? Tell me Hannah, how is it now?" 
                  Hannah could not answer. She simply buried her pale face in her hands, and her stifled sobs and moans revealed to her brother, much better than words could have done, the deep agony of her soul. He watched her for a minute or two in silence, after which he continued, his voice growing somewhat cold and reproving: 
                  "I deemed you wiser-better." 
                  "O, brother!" 
                  "Not only that you have disgraced-" 
                  She would not let him speak out the rest. She had disgraced nobody-was conscious of no crime. She dropped her hands from her face, and riveted her eyes, sparkling with wounded pride, upon him. 
                  "Brother, what do you mean?" she said angrily, her cheeks turning red. "Tell me, what do you mean by this assertion? Is this the kind of greeting you have reserved for your already too unhappy sister? Is it not enough to suffer as I do, without hearing you bring charges against me? How dare you say, or even believe, that I, a 'PRESTON,' could be guilty of any thing that was disgraceful in the eyes of God and man? I love you, Newton, am more than happy to see you back, but do not, do not speak to me in this manner. I am sorely tried, and it requires but little more to make me mad." 
                  She rose from her seat, and, with her head proudly erected, and her eyes flashing fire and restlessly rolling in their sockets, moved across the room and placed herself before the window that looked down into the garden. Her brother's glance had followed her, and as it took in the grace and dignity of her tall and slender form, he could scarcely believe in the truth of the several rumors he had heard since his return, but which had not yet reached the ears of his parents. 
                  "Hannah!" he said, more softly, also approaching the window, and twining his manly arm around her slender waist, "Hannah, you know me blunt, therefore do not weigh my words too nicely. Traveling, as you see, has not improved my manners. Come away from this window, let us sit down and calmly speak to one another. I see you have kept your troubles so far to yourself; whether you have done wisely or not, I am still unable to judge. I think you should have confided your griefs to your mother." 
                  So saying, he led her back from the window to the settee she had occupied after they had first entered the apartment. It was then that she recollected the visitor she had so unceremoniously left alone in the drawing-room. 
                  "I have quite forgotten," she said, "that I have left a visitor below, without excusing myself for my disappearance. Let me call one of the girls." 
                  She passed through the door, sought Jane, and instructed her in the message we have heard her deliver to Mr. Broadwell. 
                  Hannah returned to her brother and let herself down by his side. He could read in that sad, colorless face of hers, that she was by no means happy; and, in fact, she had suffered more than she was likely to confess, even to him. A sigh just escaped her thin lips, and a single tear trickled down her cheeks. 
                  Mr. Newton Preston was a young man of a fine education, of an excellent character, and of a splendid personal appearance. He had much of his mother's composition in him. He was cold and stern, and not easily aroused to anger. He was also exceedingly proud and haughty, without being very vain, though he by no means undervalued himself. In fact, he knew who he was, and was aware of his standing in society. It would be doing him gross injustice to call him hardhearted, although at no single instance had he been known to exhibit any unusual generosity. He had never displayed great feelings for the poor and afflicted, which, however, might be attributed to his lack of knowledge of their trials, he having never known want or sorrow at his parental home. He was only sensitive upon one point, and that was the honor of his family and his own. He would never suffer a stain to rest upon the name of "Preston." 
                  "Sister, as we are alone now," he said, in his ordinary tone of voice, and very dispassionately, "I should be pleased to hear from your own lips what has transpired here between yourself and husband, that gave rise to so many rumors, which must be stopped at once-be there a foundation for them or not-and that before they reach our parents' ear." 
                  "O, Newton, how can I commence?" she said, sadly, at the same time heaving a long sigh. "There is so much, so much to say." 
                  "Commence at the commencement, and end with the end," was Newton's reply. "Tell me all, so I may know whom to blame, and how to guide myself." 
                  And she did tell him all. She kept nothing from him. Told him how she first had become estranged from her husband. How she began to depreciate him, against her own will and inclination, simply because he was a Jew. How it eventually grew into a kind of prejudice, then dislike, and lastly into an indifference toward him she did not take the least pains to conceal, and which he had not been slow in discovering. How he tried to retain her love; and lastly she told Newton of his departure, and the rumor she had heard about his elopement. 
                  "And why have you confided to a stranger rather than to your parents, to your mother?" Newton inquired, as soon as Hannah had completed her narration. 
                  "I don't know myself," she said: "I presume it was a feeling of shame that kept me from it." 
                  Newton rose and slowly passed up and down the room. His brow was knitted and his cheeks were somewhat paler. His pride had been wounded. The honor of his house had been violated. He cared little for the loss his sister had sustained; it was not this that nettled him. 
                  "You should have confided at once to your mother," he said sternly to his sister. "She would have given you better counsel, and prepared society to meet the news of your husband's disgraceful departure." 
                  "I fed myself with the hope that he would return again," she said, shyly, and blushing. "I did not think he could remain away." 
                  Newton stationed himself in front of Hannah. He looked calm, but the expression of his manly face gradually became stern as his eyes were riveted upon her. 
                  "You flattered yourself that he would return again?" he said, meaningly. The blood of the Prestons ran hot through his veins. "And you would have acknowledged him again as your husband, and live with him?" he continued, his voice growing more bitter. "And is this the daughter of my father that thus speaks?" Then abruptly-"Hannah, your husband is a low-born villain; never more shall he live in the house of my sister. Henceforth his existence shall be ignored by us as unworthy of our remembrance; but if we should, perchance, meet him, we shall look upon him as we would upon a dog that bit the master that was kind to him." 
                  He said no more, but walked up and down the room in silence for several minutes. 
                  "We must let our parents know of this at once," he continued. 
                  "I can not tell them," she said, falling into tears. 
                  "I shall do it for you-leave it to me." 
                   
                  Then to himself: "I did not anticipate to have to perform such unpleasant duties on my return; however, 'tis once so, and can not well be avoided." 
                  Again he walked slowly up and down the room. He was angry-angry at Edgar Armhold, the husband of his sister. 
                  "Is there no way of catching this wretch and bringing him to justice?" he remarked bitterly, as he abruptly stopped in the centre of the room. "Of such vile conduct, and without the slightest shadow of an excuse, I have not thought the basest knave capable." 
                  "And do you then really believe in the truth of this elopement?" Hannah inquired, faint-voiced. 
                  "I do." 
                  A pang shot through her heart. This remark of her brother had extinguished the little hope of Edgar's innocence she had still entertained. 
                  "I wish I were dead," she lisped, hiding her face in her hands. 
                  "Why do you wish you were dead?" inquired her brother. 
                  "Because." 
                  She rose from her seat, and, with her hands still over her face, moved toward the door. Here she remained a moment, then turned around, ran toward her brother and fell in his arms, exclaiming, amid sobs and tears: "Newton! Newton! I am so unhappy!" 
                  "I trust you do not mind the loss of such a husband." 
                  "But I do, Newton, but I do. I can't help it. It almost kills me." And she fell into hysterics. 
                  "Where are your senses, Hannah?" he said, half angry. "Edgar Armhold is unworthy of being the husband of my sister." 
                  She simply replied by weeping, and he continued: 
                  "How can you care for the loss of a man for whom you have neither love nor respect? We will with ease obtain a divorce for you, and then-" 
                  "-I shall be more miserable even then now." 
                  "No, no," her brother remonstrated; "you shall then be free to choose among the best the best." 
                  "O, do not speak to me of another love while he is living. Despite his unfaithfulness, I am still his wife and my child his son. I have tried my very best to reason myself out of this belief and learn to forget him, but only since his absence I feel how deeply I loved him. I will not deny it to you, brother, I do love him yet, and could even forgive him in my heart for this great outrage he has committed on my feelings, were he only to return to me again." 
                  Newton had listened calmly and quietly. He had not interrupted his sister. Now, she being through, he commenced: 
                  "Hannah, you must school yourself better than this. You have told me that even your servants in the house have a mysterious look about them. You must show yourself adequate for the task you will shortly be called upon to perform. Edgar Armhold is gone, he will remain gone. Love him or not love him, will not change this matter. So this much is settled. But listen. The air will be pregnant with rumors now, and the least thing will be exaggerated and increased, that one will scarcely know from whence its origin. All this you have to expect. You will be attacked on all sides and be frowned down by inexorable society for the misfortune that has overtaken you. Misfortune and guilt are synonyms by the majority and the indiscriminating, and therefore both share alike from their hands. Among these trials, sister Hannah" and here he grew more solemn, "do not forget that you are a PRESTON. Conscious of no guilt yourself, suffer these rumors to pass by unheeded, until they have died away a natural death. Let society have its fill and gloat over your misfortune. Doubtless, much blame will be attached to you, in fact all the blame, for Edgar Armhold is absent, and man prefers to shoot his poisoned arrows at the nearest bosoms. For in hearing the wail of our neighbors, the wicked find a peculiarly soothing charm. So prepare yourself for the worst. Enemies who have lain quiet until now, will now show their hideous faces, and do their little to make you feel still worse; and persons you have thought your friends will be found as luckewarm as strangers. But do not mind it, sister:-be a Preston! be a Preston!" 
                  "O! what a horrible horrible future!" Hannah exclaimed, turned cold as clay, and swooned away. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Oppressed with grief, oppressed with care, 
                              A burden more than I can bear, 
                              I sit me down and sigh: 
                              O, life! thou art a galling load, 
                              A long, a rough, a weary road, 
                              To wretches such as I. 
                           
                         
                        BURNS. 
                      
                   
                  IF Mrs. Armhold was unhappy, her cousin, Carrie Harrington was no less so. On the evening of the same day on which the conversation narrated in the preceding chapter took place between Mr. Newton Preston and his sister, Miss Carrie Harrington might have been seen seated before the window in her own apartment in Clifton, on the second floor. Her elbow was resting on the sill; the small white palm of her hand supported her chin; and her once laughing blue eyes, now sad and thoughtful, were steadily, but not intently, bent upon the silent lawn, still green with verdure, spreading itself out before her view. Stillness reigned all over the house-all over the place. The sun had long since bid adieu to the Western hills, and the servants, through with their daily toil, had retired to their own rooms. So all was still about the house. Lionel had not yet returned from the city. 
                  As remarked, Carrie was seated by the window, absently looking down upon the green lawn. No one was in the room beside herself, and though it had gradually grown darker and darker, she did not rise to light a lamp. She loved solitude; she loved silence; she loved darkness. They were her friends; and she was now in their midst, instrusting her thoughts to them. Now and then a tear would come to her eye, which she would not wipe away, but suffer solitarily to trickle down her pale and almost emaciated cheeks. She was alternately thinking of the past, her present and her future. Every little incident of her life came back afresh to her memory, but even those that had marked the happiest days of her existence, were now looked upon with the same callousness as the most trivial. Nothing gave her particular pleasure or pain. She was indifferent to every thing. She had once enjoyed life, but now she had nothing more to live for. She had loved with her whole heart and soul, and while she had done so the whole universe had smiled to her. But now 'twas different. The last ray of hope had departed from her soul. She had even ceased to weep, for nothing effected her more. 
                  It struck ten o'clock, and still she had not changed her position by the window. She was now looking down the graveled road that led up the front yard from the pike. A man on horseback was making his way to the house. She had no difficulty to recognize him. It was no other than her brother Lionel. He had left early in the morning for the city, and was now returning home. 
                  Now Carrie rose and lighted a lamp, then sat down again by the window, waiting for her brother, who, in order to reach his room, had to pass her own. She had to wait something like a half-hour before he made his appearance. The door of her room was ajar, and as he looked in he saw her beckon to him. He entered at once, and approached to where she sat, her sad, thoughtful face turned up to his. 
                  "Carrie, I trust you have not been waiting for me again," he commenced, drawing a chair near hers; "I have repeatedly told you to cease these nightly vigils, for they are injurious to your health. What should you care for me now? Have I not almost made a beggar out of you? Have I not gambled away the greatest part of your means? And still you are as kind to me now as ever. No, Carrie, no; you must not heed my early going out nor my late coming home." 
                  "Lionel, you are sober to-night." 
                  "I am, Carrie." 
                  "I am glad of it, for I would speak to you a serious word." 
                  "What is it, Carrie?" 
                  "I want you to sell this place, Lionel, and move away." 
                  "Move away from Clifton?" 
                  "Yes, Lionel, move away from Clifton?" 
                  "And go-?" 
                  "-any where we are not known." 
                  And Carrie turned her face toward the window, to conceal the tears that had come to her eyes. 
                  "Wherefore?" 
                  "I want to lead a purer life. I want to reform," she said, almost solemnly, her lips trembling. 
                  Lionel said nothing in return, but looked at his sister for a moment, then lifted her cold hand to his lips, and pressed a kiss upon it for the first time in a number of years. 
                  "I wish to God I were as good as you," he said hoarsely, scarcely able to restrain himself from weeping. "But I am not good, Carrie, and never more will be good. I am gone too far. I can not live without dice, without cards, without whisky. Besides, I am head and heels in debt." 
                  "Let us sell all we have to pay what you owe, brother," Carrie replied, confidingly and affectionately looking into his eyes, "and then commence a new life. You can not owe so much but what we shall have something left to go upon, even after all our debts are paid. What say you, Lionel? Will you do your sister this favor? Will you sell this place? Will you take me away from here-far away from all my acquaintances-and domicile me among strangers? Will you do all this for me?" 
                  "Carrie, are you calm?" 
                  "I am, Lionel," she replied, though, if the truth must be told, the sad, serene tone of his voice, and his unusually sober look, had made her feel uneasy. 
                  "Well, if you are calm," he continued, after a short pause, "I will tell you that the house in which we live, and the land upon which it stands, are no longer mine. I have long since been compelled to sell them, and the money-" Here he paused for a moment, as if to prepare her for what was coming-"and the money," he continued "every cent of it is gone." 
                  He rose from his seat and began to pace up and down the room. For some time Carrie sat there dumbfounded, watching her brother. At last she also rose from her chair and followed him to the window, where he now stood, gazing through its panes. "Brother!" she said, twining her arms around his neck, and laying her head upon his bosom, "what will become of you now?" And she fell in tears. 
                  "Let not that trouble you, my sister," he said, indistinctly, and drawing her closer to his bosom. "No, let not that trouble you. To me wealth has been a curse, and I only regret the loss thereof on your account. For you were not born to work. Your hands, your feet, your form and your education, bespeak speak the lady. Yes, what will become of you, my sister? What will become of you? It is only this thought that troubles me. Yes, it is this alone that haunts me day and night, whether at home by your side, or at the gaming-table with my companions, I imagine to hear your well-deserved curses fall upon my head. For I am the guilty wretch, the unnatural, feelingless brother, who has not only staked his, but also his sister's all, at cards and dice." 
                  "And is every thing lost?" she whispered. 
                  "Every thing-more than every thing. Curse me! curse me! I deserve nothing better. A drunkard and a gambler!" 
                  Carrie raised her face to her brother's, then kissed him upon his cold brow. 
                  "Curse you, my brother? No! Whom should I bless if I cursed you?" she said, softly, tenderly. "No, no; I have no reproaches to make. Come, let us sit down, brother, and consult together. It has been taught to us in childhood that God forsakes not those who put their trust in Him, and I do put my trust in him now. He will listen to my prayers, and help us out of our troubles." 
                  Brother and sister, with bowed heads and crest-fallen faces, left the window and slowly made their way back to their respective seats. 
                  "We have a friend who will assist us," continued Carrie, her womanly courage rising with the emergency. "To him let us confide your pecuniary embarrassment." 
                  "And who is the friend of whom you speak?" Lionel inquired. 
                  "I allude to Mr. Broadwell," she said. "He is a friend of ours, and will not abuse our confidence." 
                  "Carrie, why conceal any thing from you?" replied Lionel. "Know, then, that the Reverend Doctor Broadwell is not only the present proprietor of this house and these lands, but that he is also my largest creditor. Yes, my sister, it is he to whom I am sold body and soul. Yes, it is he, reverend minister as he is, who has introduced me at the gaming-table, and made of me, to a great extent, what I am." 
                  Here he stopped and relapsed into silence. Carrie looked at him in bewilderment. She could scarcely believe her senses that she had heard aright. 
                  "What!" she exclaimed, "the Reverend Mr. Broadwell a gambler? Impossible!" 
                  "Carrie, I have spoken but too true. This very moment he has it in his power to ruin me. I owe him more money now than I shall ever be able to pay him back." 
                  "Broadwell a gambler! Why! to expose this would undo him at once." 
                  "A man of means is never undone, Carrie," remarked Lionel, coolly. "And he is a man of means. Let us suppose for a moment that I expose him. What would be the result? He would simply pack up, leave Cincinnati, and go elsewhere, while I would be called upon to settle with him before his departure. And how could I do it? Where should I get the money from? Carrie, we must keep Broadwell our friend, but do not expect of him that assistance of which you spoke. I have not yet given up all hopes to recover my losses. Carrie, luck will and must change sooner or later. Though I am still young, I have seen enough of life to have discovered that man has his ups and downs. I am down now, Carrie-I feel confident that I will not always remain so. All I require of you is that you will be patient and suffer me to pursue my course for the present without the least molestation. Will you promise me this, Carrie?" 
                  "Any thing that you deem good for yourself I will promise you," she whispered, tears, at the same time, trickling down her cheeks. 
                  "I feel better now, Carrie," said her brother, "since I have unburthened my heart to you." 
                  "I wish you had done so sooner," she replied; "the remedy could have been found much easier." 
                  "'Tis too late to speak of it now. There is no danger that we shall be in want, or that our circumstances will be discovered by any person, as long as we remain on friendly footing with Broadwell. Promise me, therefore, that you will never give him offense, however much cause you may have to do so. Promise me this, and all will yet be well." 
                  "I promise, Lionel." 
                  "And I trust you unto death. But now, Carrie, let me go to my room, and you also seek your couch, for it is late, and I shall have to rise early in the morning." 
                  So saying, he rose from his chair, looked at his time-piece, said good night to his sister, then passed through the door, turned to the left, descended a flight of stairs, walked through the lower hall, and stopped before the door of the coachman's room. He gave it three low taps, and when these remained unanswered he repeated the same, only somewhat louder. At last the occupant was aroused. 
                  "John," said Lionel in a half-whisper, "get up and dress yourself." 
                  John knew his master's voice. He hurriedly left his bed and dressed himself, then opened the door and admitted him. 
                  "Any thing wanted?" inquired the servant, rubbing his eyes. 
                  "Yes, you have got to go to the city for me." 
                  "When? To-night?" 
                  "Yes, as soon as you can get ready." 
                  John rubbed his eyes again, and stretched his weary limbs and arms. 
                  "Well, what shall I do in the city?" 
                  "I want you to go and see Mr. Broadwell, and tell him to come to me at once. Not to lose a moment but come and meet me at the lower gate-do you hear me; at the lower gate. Tell him that! expect him without fail." 
                  "But if he should ask me for the reason?" inquired the servant. 
                  "Tell him that he shall hear that of me. Now go, but don't fail to bring him along with you. But make no noise nor let Carrie see you leave or return." 
                  So saying, he walked out into the chilly air, heaving a heavy sigh, then gnashed his teeth, and hurried along the graveled footpath that led to the lower gate. 
                  And what was Carrie doing? Had she gone to bed? No. Again she sat by the window, but now her eyes were swollen and red from weeping. A thousand times she wished herself dead, but death came not to her relief, though her heart seemed momentarily to sink within her bosom. At last a sort of dull, deadening calm came over her frame and spirit, and she sat there as one totally benumbed. Nearly two hours passed in this manner before she recollected herself, and became aroused from her apathy. What had become of Lionel? she inquired of herself. She had seen him turn to the left when he quitted her room, and he had not yet returned to his own, for she had not seen him repass the hall which, in order to reach his own apartment, he would have had to do. Not knowing what to think of it, she was about to go in search of him, when she beheld from the window, in front of her, on the graveled path that wound itself around a narrow slope, the shadows of two men. Another look convinced her that one of these men was her brother. She watched them until they disappeared behind some trees, then left the window, picked up a light shawl which she threw over her shoulders, extinguished the light, then stole noiselessly from her room and the house. She flitted like a dark phantom of the night through the tall grass, until she had caught up with the two dark shadows of the two men, when she stationed herself behind a tree from whence she could listen to their conversation. 
                  And she did listen to it. Not a word did escape her ears. Good God! how her heart beat. Here she stood-enveloped in darkness-listening to words that harrowed up her very soul. What should she do? Rush forth from her hiding place, save her brother and confront-- 
                  No! 
                  All was still again. The two men had ceased to speak, and gone through the gate in the direction of the city. For a moment Carrie was undecided whether to follow them or to turn back. She concluded to do the latter. She returned to the house and to her room. Arrived there she threw herself upon the cold floor, and tossing herself from one position into another, burst forth in a shower of tears. 
                  On the following morning the servants of the house found her still lying on the floor, in a state of utter unconsciousness. 
                  Lionel had not returned that night. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Well, read my cheek and watch my eye- 
                              Too strictly schooled are they, 
                              One secret of my soul to show, 
                              One hidden thought betray. 
                           
                         
                        MISS LANDON. 
                      
                   
                  REUBEN ARMHOLD, as the reader is aware, has made his home with the Montgomerys. Two nicely-furnished rooms had been allotted to his special use. One of these rooms he designed for his sleeping apartment, and the other for his study or sitting-room. While seated in the latter, on the same evening when Carrie was watching for her brother's return from the city, and which we related in our last chapter, Mr. Montgomery, after knocking for admittance, but without waiting for a response, opened the door, upon the sill of which he remained stationary for a moment, and then said, in his usual blunt and abrupt manner of speaking: 
                  "As I live, again in a brown study! Have you not promised me to throw off this sober, freezing look of yours, and put on again that lively air that once made you so great a favorite, and gave you the name of 'the reckless'?" 
                  So saying, Mr. Montgomery advanced into the room and approached Reuben Armhold, who now rose, and, with a faint smile upon his lips, took the old and good-natured gentleman by the hand, and led him to a seat. 
                  "I shall endeavor," he said, as he sat down, "to break myself from the habit of seeming morose. At all events, I shall never intrude myself into your company while my temper is soured and peevish. You know that TIME is a good remedy, Mr. Montgomery; I have no fears it will teach me to overcome myself in this particular, and then you shall more often, if you so desire it, have a brighter face to look upon. But now, believe me, sir, to be lively, or even to look so, is a thing it would require the mightiest efforts to accomplish." 
                  He said nothing else. His lips were once more closed, and not a muscle stirred in his pale, thoughtful, story face. His deep black eyes were vaguely turned toward the opposite wall, watching the gray, fitful shadows as they slowly passed, in long dark streaks, from the ceiling down upon the floor. 
                  "Reuben," Montgomery commenced, after watching the young man for a moment, "do not think me inquisitive. You can not-I know you can not-imagine how deeply I loved your brother Edgar. You must, therefore, not misconstrue my meaning if I am a little bold in my questions. It is my nature to be open and plain-spoken. Tell me, what is the matter with you?" 
                   
                  Reuben slowly turned his gaze upon the old man, and said, in a tone of voice that was both respectful and decisive: 
                  "Mr. Montgomery, there is nothing the matter with me-nothing." 
                  "But there is, Reuben; I can see it. As I said before, I do not wish to pry into your secrets merely for curiosity's sake. No, Reuben, no. It is solely because I take a deep interest in you that I inquire of you the cause of this-I might say unnatural-reserve, thoughtfulness, moroseness, and your total withdrawal from our family circle. I know a man of your age, if nothing be the matter with him, will not act-I am sure of it-so strangely as you do. You scarcely ever speak unless you are spoken to; and when you do speak, it is with a reluctance too noticeable to escape attention. Reuben! Reuben!" and he moved a little closer to his thoughtful friend, "what is the matter with you? You are not poor; I know you are not. If you had nothing save the ten thousand dollars which Edgar left you, you would not be in want. What is it, then, that ails you?" 
                  "Nothing. I am once so. I can not change myself. This disposition, this moroseness, I am sorry to say, makes all those around me miserable. I wish I could alter it. Believe me, it is only the effort to change myself from what I am that pains me. Somehow, the greater my melancholy, and the more I turn into myself, the more relief I find. It is in trying to become a worldling that I suffer." 
                  "This is strange talk for a young man," Mr. Montgomery remarked, doubtingly, and shaking his head. "I know that Edgar was also sad, reserved, and thoughtful. But he was-you will excuse the expression-not as repelling-no, I do not precisely mean repelling-I mean so callously mysterious, and so mysteriously callous, as you appear to be. You could read in his face something that drew you toward him, something that made you love him and sympathize with him. But in your face, Reuben, there is something cold-I can't well define it; something that says 'Leave me alone; I do not wish you to take any interest in me, nor do I seek your sympathy; all I care for is to be left alone.' Reuben, I was a friend of your brother; let me also be your friend. You are not poor; what are you, then? Are you in love?" and he drew his chair still closer to the one occupied by Reuben, in whose dark eyes he now looked, as if he wanted to read the secret of his heart in them. "What are you, then? Are you in love?" he repeated. 
                  An expression of disdain passed over Reuben's undisturbed features, and his thin, dry lips curled in bitterness, as he remarked: 
                  "No, I'm not in love." A dead halt. The lips closed again, the bitter curl and expression of disdain vanished, and once more that face assumed a blank, cold look. 
                  "If you are not in love-what then?" Montgomery said. Waiting a moment, as if to gain courage for what he was about to add, he continued, his voice sinking almost to a whisper, at the same time placing Reuben's right hand between his own: "What then? Have you done something bad-committed a crime?" 
                  "A crime?" Scarcely had these words been dropped from Mr. Montgomery's lips, before Reuben was up from his seat, his broad, manly chest expanding, and quickly rising and falling, as if his heart had grown too large for it, and was trying to effect an outlet between his ribs. His lips were more compressed, and his eyes grew restless in their sockets. But all this only lasted for a moment. He suffered his glance to rest for a second upon Mr. Montgomery, and then was as calm as before. 
                  "Mr. Montgomery," he said, in a serious, earnest tone, "I have committed no crime." 
                  "I did not think you had, Reuben," Montgomery replied, apologetically. "But something must be the matter with you; it lies heavily on your heart, and if I could share it with you, why, I would do it." 
                  Reuben drew near the old man and warmly shook his hand, saying: 
                  "Your kindness almost unmans me, Mr. Montgomery. You are truly a good man. But if you love me-and I know you do-pray let me retain my own secret; for to reveal it, would make me lose the little desire I still have to live. It is to me a treasure I can never part with-never shall part with"-and here a bitter frown passed over his brow-"until the proper time has arrived." 
                  So saying, he began to pace the floor-Mr. Montgomery thoughtfully watching that graceful, well-knit, manly figure, as it passed by him with an unassumed, natural dignity. 
                  Just then a servant knocked at the door, and after entering, informed Mr. Montgomery that Mrs. Montgomery was waiting for him. 
                  "Tell my wife I shall be down instantly." And the servant withdrew, while Mr. Montgomery continued to Reuben: 
                  "I have promised to escort her to one of our neighbors'; I must keep my promise. You know women are women. You must never give them the slightest cause for complaint, for when they are angry they are like very devils. No conscience-no conscience, and less reason. But my wife is by no means the worst; especially when I let her have her own way, I can get along with her right well. Nonsense, nonsense. There's no use to speak to you about women; you have as yet had no experience in that line; but this much let me tell you: the most economical female is extravagant, and even the wisest of them is a fool. Had they as much brain as they have tongue, they would then need no tears to enlist our sympathies when they have committed unpardonable offenses, from which they know not how otherwise to extricate themselves. Yes, yes, Reuben," he continued, good-humoredly, "when you once have come into a woman's clutches, then will be the proper time for putting on a sour face, but not sooner. So come along down stairs; I want you to keep Nellie company until my wife and I return. She is not satisfied with you at all; you are too reserved for her, she says. I want you to apologize to her and do better; do you hear me?" 
                  Ten minutes afterward Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery had left the house, and Reuben and Nellie were seated in the drawing-room. 
                  "And father told you," she said, smiling, and coquettishly gazing upon her thoughtful companion, "that I had raised a serious complaint against you? And in truth I have, Mr. Armhold. You have been very uncivil to me." 
                  The warm blood rushed into Reuben's cheeks and colored them crimson. Nellie observed it, and her cheeks also turned red. She had intended this remark for a joke-nothing more-not thinking but that Reuben would take it in good humor, and look upon it in no other light than that through which she saw it. But no sooner had she seen the unlooked-for effect it had produced upon him than she regretted to have uttered it. Therefore, she was not very slow to apologize. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she said, shyly raising her blue eyes upon him, "you must not mind me. I don't always mean what I say. I speak so much-'pa often scolds me for it. I did not intend to wound your feelings; indeed I did not. Won't you forgive me?" 
                  Her voice was soft, tender, and pleading; her eyes were tearful, and her gaze was so meek and subdued that Reuben's heart was turned toward her, and even justified her for the accusation she had brought against him. 
                  "Miss Montgomery," he said, in a clear, softened tone, "spare yourself the pain of apologizing to me, for I feel guilty of the charge, and I can not but reproach myself for being constantly so much taken up with myself as to have forgotten the courtesies and duties I owe to others." 
                  Nellie could only be sad for a moment; it was not in her nature to continue in that mood for any length of time. She therefore commenced to smile as she replied, good-humoredly: 
                  "Now don't charge yourself with any breach of courtesy or duty, for I won't listen to it; indeed I won't. I do like to see men look stern and thoughtful, though I must confess none would believe it who know what a wild girl I am. Let me just inform you that I am not always choice about language, and sometimes say one thing and mean quite another. When I said you were uncivil, I simply intended to convey the idea that you had not yet paid me the compliments my vanity anticipated. This is all-am I forgiven? Say yes or no-am I forgiven?" And she smiled such an irresistible smile, as she now rose from her chair and approached Mr. Armhold, with her small dimpled hand stretched out toward him. 
                  "Say yes or no;" and her laughing blue eyes looked mischievously into his own. 
                  "Yes;" and he gently and respectfully pressed her warm and delicate hand. 
                  "I knew you would forgive me," she said joyfully, a bright tear trickling down her rosy cheeks. "Now, since we are friends again I am going to ask you a question. You won't think hard of me?" she continued archly, "or will you?" 
                  "Ask me any question," Reuben replied, a faint smile passing over his lips; "I will answer it if I can." 
                  "Now you won't think hard of me?" 
                  "No, Miss Montgomery." 
                  "And you won't think me rude or inquisitive?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Why did you beg father to give you an introduction to Mr. Broadwell?" 
                  Reuben changed color for a moment, for this question took him by surprise. 
                  "Is there any thing astonishing in this?" he remarked. 
                  "To me there is." 
                  "Why? If I may ask you." 
                  "Because I know you hate him." 
                  Again Reuben changed color. 
                  "What cause have you to think I hate him?" he inquired, gazing on the freespoken girl before him. 
                  "What cause? I don't know. I can't say precisely that I have any cause, and yet-and yet-" 
                  "-and yet what?" he interrupted. 
                  "I saw you give him a look when he did not see you-a look I shall never forget while I live. I said then to myself, as I saw your brow knit and your eyes shoot forth such terrible light, that Mr. Broadwell and you had met before, and that you had a grudge against him for something connected in your history, which seemed to have slipped his memory, though it still lived in your own." 
                  "Mr. Broadwell and I are warm friends," Reuben advanced, but Nellie shook her head, as if she doubted him in this particular. 
                  "I don't like this Mr. Broadwell, though he is a great friend of father," she continued. "And I know you hate him, though you appear to be his friend." 
                  "Appearances do deceive sometimes," he said. 
                  "They do, indeed." 
                  "I am naturely stern and repulsive. You have undoubtedly seen me when I was not in the best of temper. Why? Does Mr. Broadwell doubt my sincerity?" 
                  "No, not that I know, Mr. Armhold; but whether you are his friend or not, I doubt 
                     his sincerity, and if I were to tell father of what I know against him, he would no longer admit him in his house." 
                  "I have no right to pry into your secrets, Miss Montgomery, but if you know aught against Broadwell you may inform me of it, and if he has wronged you I shall see you righted, as there is a God in Heaven!" 
                  Reuben had suffered his passion to get the better of him. The remark he had made betrayed at once to Nellie the state of his feelings. She could read in his quick glance, in the color of his face, in his trembling lips, the eagerness with which he had picked up her words. In consequence of which she thought over the folly she had committed by her tattling, took warning, and resolved in her mind to keep in the future a better guard over her tongue. Reuben, too, was not slow to discover the error he had committed in suffering himself so unnecessarily to lose his equanimity. Had he remained calm, cool and collected, in all probability Nellie would have communicated to him what she knew against the Rev. Doctor Broadwell. But now that chance for information on this head was-at least for the present-lost to him, for she remained silent, perfectly silent, though he had sworn, by heaven itself, to see her righted if she had been wronged. She even felt uneasy, embarrassed, as she met the glance of those deep, black pupils, that seemed to grow brighter and brighter as they gazed into her abashed and bewildered face. Much would she have given at that moment had Reuben relieved her of his society, or if some one else had joined their company. She was simply a girl of sixteen, and a girl of that age is very easily startled-frightened. 
                  Therefore, she heeded not this remark, and remained silent, not only upon this, but upon every other topic. She now and then raised her eyes shyly to his face, as if in expectancy of something unpleasant from her companion's lips. But she was mistaken, for Reuben had by this time regained his composure, and was ready to lead the conversation into a different channel. Gradually his stern features softened down, and as he was naturally handsome of face, the mild expression of his eyes, the serenity of his brow, and the faint smile upon his cheeks and lips, at once put Nellie at ease. 
                  "Now," he commenced, his rich, manly voice modulated and lowered to the proper key, "you have had ample opportunity of judging my temper and disposition. My rudeness and incivility could not, and has not escaped your attention. What right had I to offer myself, unworthy as I am, to become your champion? Have I the slightest claim to your confidence? No. But I know you will pardon me for this want of common propriety when I assure you"-and here his voice grew solemn, and his words came slowly, one after another-"that for five long years I have not had an opportunity to utter a syllable to a single lady." 
                  Nellie looked upon him with amazement. She could scarcely comprehend the meaning of these words. How a man in this civilized world could have had no opportunity to speak, in the term of five years, a word to a single lady-why, it was beyond her comprehension. She had to stare at him. There was something inexplicable to her in the meaning of these words. 
                  "I do not understand you," she acknowledged, half aloud. 
                  "Miss Montgomery," he replied, "I do not love to deal in mysticisms, but in this particular instance I can not-must not be explicit. Would that I could make myself more intelligible to you, and I feel confident that your generosity would lead you to pardon in me my uncouth and strange conduct, as well as that want of manners and courtesy which every gentleman of the least refinement should observe in the presence of a lady. I will not deny to you that something rests heavily upon my heart; what that something is, I have vowed to myself to keep concealed until the time for which I am pining, and now see approaching, shall have arrived. In the interim," and here a faint smile, like a fainter shadow, passed over his colorless cheeks, "I must beg of you that patience and indulgence we so unsparingly show to wayward children. Now, Miss Montgomery," he continued, assuming a livelier air, "I have a favor to ask of you. You are a good musician, a sweet singer-will you oblige me with a song?" 
                  "Certainly I will," she answered, unhesitatingly; "but I am an indifferent singer." 
                  "Pray, let me be the judge myself. Perhaps you are not aware that I have had a taste of your quality before, and, without venturing at an unmeaning flattery, was truly charmed by it?" 
                  "Now, Mr. Armhold," she replied, archly looking into his face, "I had thought you incapable of those complimentary phrases with which my admirers-and you must know I have quite a host of them-like to raise and tickle my vanity. I expected better of you. If you have heard me sing, you know that I am scarcely entitled to the most sparing encomium." 
                  "Let us, I pray you," Reuben replied, "defer entering upon an argument as to your deserts in regard to your musical cultivation until after you have favored me with a song." 
                  "Well, what will you have?" and Nellie rose, and, followed by Reuben, took a seat in front of the piano; "what will you have?" 
                  "I scarcely know what piece to ask for. Let me hear you sing one of your own favorites. I doubt not it will meet with my approval." 
                  "Do you love a lively air?" she asked, archly, looking over her own shoulders at her thoughtful companion, who had taken up a position behind her; "do you love something lively?" 
                  Reuben wanted music, and, if the fact must be told, cared very little whether it were sad or lively. In order to satisfy his lovely, guileless interrogator, he said he would be pleased to have something lively. 
                  "Now, don't laugh if you catch me making mistakes," she said, and suffered her small, beautifully tapered fingers to pass lightly over the ivory keys. "Now, don't laugh-please don't!" and a moment later, the prelude on the piano being finished, her voice, sweet as that of a joyous, happy nightingale, and clear as the tingle of a silver bell, rose from her throat and wantoned the air with love and mischief. Reuben listened until the echo of the echo had died away, without uttering a single word. 
                  "What do you say now?" commenced Nellie, with a mock challenge, without looking away from the piano, over which her waxlike fingers were once more flying over the several octaves. 
                  Waiting a moment without eliciting a reply, she turned her face to see what was the matter with the gentleman she had addressed. 
                  Reuben Armhold still stood there by her side, behind her stool, which she was now wheeling around in order to get a better sight of him. He was, however, so absorbed in his own reflections, of whatever nature they might have been, that he not only had not heard her remark, but even noticed not that she had raised her face to his, and was now gazing at him with a peculiar feeling of uneasiness. His pale brow was strangely inexpressive of expression-a blank that made her think of a coffin's lid, under which something that had had life and animation, now quietly reposed and was moldcring. His eyes were vaguely bent upon the wall, and seemed, for all the rays they emitted, to be of glass, and rather the creation of art than of nature. After Nellie had looked upon him for a moment, without drawing his attention, she turned around once more toward the front of the piano, and, after once more preluding upon it, commenced to sing "Home, sweet home." Never in her life had she sang better. Her whole soul-the soul of an innocent girl-seemed to have been thrown into her voice. Now it gradually rose from key to key, and anon it fell into the softest cadence. For some time it had not the least visible effect upon Reuben; but before she had got half through the first verse, he gave a start as if he had been aroused from a reverie, and gradually his cold, hard features became softened, and his eyes suffused with tears. Nellie still continued with her song. Sweeter and sweeter became her voice, and softer and softer became the cadences. Still she sang, now and then lightly touching the ivory keys to blend their deeper tones with those which rose from her breast like the soft plaints of a love-lorn nightingale. Reuben was still listening, but once more that face was a face of stone. The tears which had suffused his eyes a moment before, were no longer there. All seemed dry and hard. The tune had made him think of bygone days, of many long, long years of suffering; had made him ponder over his departed joys, his extinguished hopes, his dreary future, his aimless life, his miserable existence, and the cause of his sufferings; and his heart hardened in proportion to the increased mellowness of her voice. 
                  Nellie had finished the song. The last echo was still pleading, like a tender angel's voice, in the stilly air, as she now rose from her seat to leave the instrument. Reuben watched her attentively, as she moved away from between the piano and the stool she had occupied. Not until she had gained a little distance did he begin to follow and approach her. When he had caught up with her, he gently took one of her delicate hands in his, and said: 
                  "Miss Nellie-pardon me for calling you by your Christian name-Miss Nellie, let me thank you for this rich musical treat you have suffered me to enjoy. You have a sweet voice, and a warm heart to throw into that voice. I have attentively listened to both of your songs, and I must confess that I was quite charmed and carried away by the force of your vocal powers." 
                  "Now you begin to flatter me again," she said, without raising her eyes from the floor. 
                  "Indeed, Miss Nellie," he replied, as both now sat down, "I do not aim to flatter you. That time has passed with me. I have long since ceased to be the courtier-ceased to deal in compliments. I leave that profession to younger and happier men." 
                  "Why, Mr. Armhold, you speak as if you were turning forty, and had suffered all the miseries to which flesh is heir," she said, and was about to laugh, but the sad and serious aspect of his face checked her from it. 
                  "I am but in the twentys, Miss Nellie," he remarked, in a low, hoarse key; "but, young as I am, I have seen such things-such things-O, Miss Nellie, Miss Nellie, let me not think of them, for the recollection of them would make me entirely unfit for your society; and I do not wish to be disagreeable." 
                  "I am sorry that I have touched upon a subject that gives you pain. Pray excuse me for this once, and I shall never so offend again," Nellie replied, apologetically. 
                  "You have not offended me, Miss Nellie," Reuben remarked; "on the contrary, you have shown me, in this brief interview, that you have a heart to sympathize, and I love you for it. It is not always just that man should continually force his own troubles upon others; and this is an additional reason to the one already advanced, why I am so reserved about my own affairs." 
                  "Indeed, I do not wish you to confide any of your secrets to me," Nellie said, "for I am simply a young, silly, talkative girl, without any thought or reason; but if I could do any thing for you," she continued, a blush mantling her cheeks, and her voice almost falling to a whisper, "why, I wouldn't hesitate a minute." 
                  "Thank you, Miss Nellie, for your good will; but for the present I have only one favor to ask of you, and that is, to excuse me in the future, as you have done this evening, from all seeming discourtesy." 
                  "Mr. Armhold, I really can not understand you," she replied, in a more earnest tone. "You have shown me no discourtesy. It is a mistaken idea of you gentlemen to believe us-the ladies-only fit for playthings, unworthy of the sterner sex's confidence and their more serious affairs. I am only a girl of sixteen, and, though I have quite a host of admirers with whom I chat, laugh, sing, play, aye, dance and romp about, and talk ever so much nonsense, yet you must not arrive at the conclusion that, on this account, I am unfit for a sensible, settled man's society. If you do think so, permit me to correct you. I love to hear, at times, more than the gossip of the city. And these boys-I call all men 'boys' until they have learned to leave off their fopperies and act more like men-yes, and these boys, you can scarcely ever get a sensible word out of them. What you hear of them one night, you may expect to hear of them every night. O, they are good enough," and here she broke out into a hearty, artless laugh, "to give me parties, to take me, in the summer to the ice-cream saloons, in the winter to balls and operas, etc., etc., but, as to gaining my affections, why, Mr. Armhold, I would sooner die single-and you know how much young girls dread that horrid thought-than have a booby for my beau." 
                  "I trust you do not call all men, who are of a happy, joyous temperament, boobies?" Reuben inquired, by no means displeased with the turn the conversation was taking. 
                  "Indeed not; you musn't misunderstand me," Nellie replied, the color on her oval cheeks brightening. "Indeed not. I simply meant to say that I do not like an overgrown boy, or those sentimental milk-soups who are constantly afraid to make a misstep, or of offending us by a word; who have not the manliness in them to say 'yes' when a woman says 'no,' and who have no individuality-no settled character, but like smoke-they move once here, once there-just as the wind blows. No, indeed, these are not the fellows I like;" and here, while a roguish smile brightened her laughing blue eyes, an expression of disdain curled her blood-red lips, "no indeed, these are only the butterflies we girls play with." 
                  "And what is your ideal?" Reuben inquired, becoming still more interested. 
                  "My ideal?" she exclaimed, her musical voice rising to a pretty high key. "My ideal? A man, Mr. Armhold, A MAN!" and she proudly raised her head aloft. 
                  "A man," Reuben repeated to himself. 
                  "Yes, A MAN; but not one of those perfect angels of whom we constantly read in novels, but never find a counterpart in history. My ideal is a man who has a character, an individuality; who has a little of the devil in him, but nothing, no, not a particle of 'woman.' I should prefer him all devil than womanish," she added, with unmistakable emphasis. "For if I want some toy to play with, I can obtain it with a much less sacrifice. I want a man, whether in the right or in the wrong, always to be a man who knows that he is one of Creation's lords-to command, but not to sue." 
                  "Not every man can command," Reuben remarked. 
                  "But every man has a right to fight for the scepter," Nellie said. "I have often thought that if I had been born a man, instead of a woman, I would have been one of the wildest dare-devils on earth. I would have been ambitious, too," and here she began to smile, "but not like my beaux, by excelling one another in frizzling their hair, or tying their cravats, or in catching the proper key when speaking. No! but I would have been ambitious to carve for myself a way through this world, even if I had had to tramp on every man's toes I met with to do it." 
                  Reuben looked upon her with admiration. Little had he dreamed to find such metal in this girl of sixteen. 
                  "I love to listen to you. speak on," he begged. 
                  "Well, if I don't weary you, I will speak on," she said, smiling. "We women are not all fools, as father thinks. He believes we haven't got a grain of sense; but he is mistaken," she added, with emphasis. "Certainly, when I speak of sensible women I leave out the majority of my sex, the larger portion of it. The most women-and perhaps, before I get through with my conversation, you will think me no better than they-yes, the most women (young as I am I have observed it), notwithstanding their sweet smiles, sweet accents, and still sweeter manners; notwithstanding their position in life, their education and their piety; notwithstanding their wealth, their fine drapery and their jewels; notwithstanding their own failings and their-perhaps undiscovered-wickedness; notwithstanding all these, they are simply scandal creators and scandal mongers, catching at every flying rumor sent forth by the malice of their likes, little dreaming at the time how harmless their venom is to the TRUE MAN, at whom they are hurling their poisened shafts." 
                   
                  "O, Miss Nellie," Reuben interposed, "you are a little hard on your sex. I coincide with you so far that some ladies, for the want of having something better to do, pass some of their time in-what I should call-harmless talk. I have always been of the opinion that 'meanness,' or 'a will to harm,' is not in the composition of woman." 
                  "If you have been of that opinion," Nellie replied, "the knowledge of the treatment your brother has received at the hands of his own wife, should be sufficient to convince you that also WOMAN can have a will to harm." 
                  "So many and various are the rumors," Reuben remarked, "and so conflicting are the statements in regard to the cause of my brother's departure from the city, that I can not arrive at the least satisfactory conclusion. That blame rests somewhere, is self-evident; and however much I should like to shift it from my brother's shoulders, I would not give a verdict against his wife until I have had sufficient evidence to condemn her. For it is easy to condemn-much easier than to prove our right for doing so. The more I reflect over this affair, the more strange it appears to me." 
                  "It is not strange to me; nor should it be so to you now, as you have been at your brother's house, and had an opportunity of seeing his wife." 
                  "It is true that I have seen Mrs. Armhold," Reuben replied, "and that she expressed and evinced but little grief at her husband's deserting her." 
                  Nellie gazed into Reuben's eyes, as if she wanted to read something in them, before she would reply to this remark. At last she said: 
                  "Mr. Armhold, I know not what impression your brother's wife left upon your mind, and, in all probability-judging by your character-you will be as reserved in expressing the opinion you have formed of her, as you have shown yourself upon every thing else. Yet, I venture to say that, though you may not know all the particulars that led to this final rupture between your brother and his wife, the single interview you have had with the latter must have been sufficient to turn you against her, and at once enlist your sympathies for Edgar." 
                  "May I ask you for your reasons in making this statement?" Reuben inquired. 
                  "Because she is a proud, heartless woman," Nellie replied, bitterly, "with too much honesty, however, to deny to you that she neither loved nor respected your brother." 
                  "How do you know her sentiments?" 
                  "Does not my father know them? And does not Mr. Broadwell know her feelings toward her husband, and even justify them? I tell you, Mr. Armhold, your brother has suffered much without complaining-for he never would complain-and, had it not been for Mr. Broadwell and some of the servants about the house, Edgar's cause for unhappiness would have remained a dead secret to the world." 
                  "Miss Nellie, you are a good girl." 
                  Reuben said this and rose from his chair. Nellie's eyes followed this movement, and, as they did so, a vague feeling of uneasiness crept through her bosom. She had for a moment thought herself in the company of a being with whom she might enter into any conversation, and who would, as the signs indicated, eventually throw off that reserve which he had so persistently kept up from the day of his making his home at her father's to the present, and assume that ease and familiarity a person in his position would most naturally be entitled to. But she was mistaken. Reuben once more looked the stern, unfeeling man. His eyes, his skin, his nose, his brow, his lips-every thing looked hard and dry, as if hewn out of adamant. 
                  He began to pace the floor, crossed once or twice, then stepped again before Nellie. 
                  "You have known Edgar well? Have you not, Miss Montgomery?" he asked, slowly dropping word after word. "You do not fear me, I trust?" he added, seeing that she felt too embarrassed to reply. "I would not harm a hair on your head for all the world. Have I not told you that I am rude and unmannerly, and that I am constantly so much taken up with myself, that I forget the courtesies and duties I owe to others?" After a short pause-"Be not afraid of me, for I am Edgar's brother, and Edgar's brother loves, and would die for, Edgar's friends. And you are one of his friends. Has he ever, at any time, mentioned my name to you?" 
                  "Often, very often, did he speak of his brother Reuben," Nellie replied. 
                  "And what said he of him?" 
                  "What a strange question you do ask! Would he speak ill of his only brother, when he never spoke ill against any living being?" 
                  "And was my brother Edgar so good, noble and forbearing, that he would speak ill of no one?" inquired Reuben. "Surely such a man should have no enemies; and judging from what I am pained to hear since my return to this city, my brother must have been very wicked to have so many, many foes." 
                  "Mr. Armhold," said Nellie, "your brother never harmed a child, whether in word or deed. I knew him to be good, incapable of wronging even those who wronged him, let the world say now what she will." 
                  "Why has he then so many enemies?" again inquired Reuben. 
                  A flush came to Nellie's face, as she replied, her eyes flashing fire: "Because he is good and harmless, therefore he has enemies." 
                  "You are right, Nellie; you are right!" exclaimed Reuben, full of enthusiasm. "He has enemies because he is good. And who are they? As far as I have discovered, they are beings who, were even every charge brought against my brother, proved, would be as much inferior to him in character, as virtue is above vice. I am older than you, Nellie, and have seen much of this world. I have learned to look upon it as a den of hungry wolves. I have seen how only the good must suffer, for they are not wise in intrigue, and therefore can be caught in every snare. And when once caught in the meshes-O, God! O, God! what a delicious dish for those friends to feast upon! Uncooked, half raw, each tears off a piece and devours it. Have I not seen it? Have I not listened to those human fiends, howl around the festive board, each single one pretending to be a philanthropist, still ransacked my brother's character of every jewel it possessed? O, Nellie, Nellie, is it a wonder that I am excited? I know that even the convict, confined to spend his days in some prison-house, exhibits for his fellow convict more generosity, more good will than those who send them thither, do toward one another. With what fury they now assail my brother! Every one of this righteous crew would give his mite to see him hung. And for what? Is it because he is guilty, or because they think him guilty? No! No! It is because they would have him guilty, be he as innocent as a new-born babe." 
                  "Do they speak in such harsh terms against your brother?" Nellie inquired, in a timid voice. "What can they say against him?" 
                  "What can a wicked tongue not say against a silent one? My brother left the city-deserted by his wife-gave no explanation for his conduct-'tis even rumored that he went in company with another lady. These are circumstances which might tend to his condemnation. But are they sufficient to prove guilt? Are they sufficient to damn a man? To cut his neck and throat without a hearing? May there not be some error in the reports that would materially change the whole aspect of the affair? Who knows? Do they know it? No! Do they want to know it? No! it is a foregone conclusion with them that he is guilty, and now-off with his head!" 
                  So saying, Reuben once more began to pace the floor. His face was now exceedingly flushed, and his glistening eyes rolled restless in their sockets. Nellie no longer feared him; she began to understand his character better, and now she sympathized with him. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she said, "fear not for your brother. I feel convinced that no one can injure him in the sight of those who know him. And, to tell you the truth, I have heard much harsher terms used, in reference to this matter, against his wife than against himself. There is scarcely a lady but who condemns her." 
                  This last sentence brought a bitter smile to Reuben's lips. Nellie observed it and paused, when he replied: 
                  "There is scarcely a lady but what condemns her, you say? I believe you, Miss Nellie. Man or woman-they are all alike in this particular. Man loves to destroy the reputation of his fellow-man, and woman delights in blackening the character of her sister. There is no difference in them." 
                  "I can not see what advantage," remarked Nellie, full of simplicity, "they can desire to obtain by slandering your brother?" 
                  "O, Miss Nellie, you are too young to look into the motives of these actions. Few are the men indeed who never yet committed wrong, who have not been guilty of some actions of which an honest man should blush. These men, "Reuben continued, now, strongly emphasizing every word "are the foes to honest, to good men. Having fallen, without retaining the ambition to rise again to grace and mercy, they have only one desire left, and that is, to drag and keep down in the mire their betters, of whom they can make victims. Edgar was their superior in thought, mind and heart. Had battled for and gained a reputation. Leaving his household now as he did, has given birth to ever so many unfounded rumors, which are now carried from lip to lip, augmenting in bitterness by every new transfer." 
                  "And why do not his friends defend his reputation? Might they not trace back these rumors to some responsible persons to whom the law could mete out a just punishment?" 
                  Reuben laughed-laughed bitterly. For he thought back upon his trial he had had in New York-how innocent he had been of the crime with which he had been charged, and how he had been condemned and sentenced to five years in the penitentiary, notwithstanding his innocence. 
                  Yes, he laughed bitterly. 
                  "And why do not his friends defend his reputation, you inquire, Miss Nellie?" Reuben replied. "I will tell you: When men are in trouble, be they brought on by their own wickedness or folly, or by the folly or wickedness of others-yes, when they are in trouble-friends, active friends, are few, and even they shrink from baring their breasts to the onslaught of the hungry rabble. They lack the manliness characteristic of the great. Edgar had many friends, I doubt not, in prosperity-may have some yet. But 'policy' is the watchword of the nineteenth century, and discretion the acknowledged better part of valor. Favors and offices are obtained by courting the popular voice, and who has a heart big enough to help a friend when 'self' is at stake? Miss Nellie, every man is for himself now-a-days." 
                  "And do you think his wife started these rumors?" 
                  "I do not know. I scarcely think she did. Though I have no apology to make for her-for I feel assured that she is the cause of Edgar's 
                      
                        "HERE, TAKE THIS!" AND LIONEL PLUNGED HIS KNIFE INTO EDGAR'S SHOULDER. 
                     
                     
                      gar's leaving, I still can not charge her with meanness, for I do not believe it to be part of her composition." 
                  "Well, who do you think is the starter of this malicious prosecution?" Nellie inquired. 
                  "Some one upon whom I have my eyes, and who shall not escape punishment, as there is a God in heaven. Every dog has his day: I shall yet have mine. There is no night but what is followed by a morning; there is no cloud so dark and ominous but what must pass away in time. Therefore, fear not for Edgar. His name shall be rescued from obloquy." 
                  Once more Reuben paced up and down the room, with Miss Nellie's eyes following him. He returned, however, after a few minutes' walk, and sat down by her side. He was no longer excited. The storm in his breast had blown over, and his features, though still hard, wore no longer an angry, forbidding aspect. A faint smile passed over his lips, as he suffered his deep black eyes to rest upon the lovely blonde with whom he had kept up this strange colloquy. 
                  "Mr. Armhold, why do you smile?" she said, in a remarkably sweet voice. 
                  "I scarcely know it myself, Miss Nellie," Reuben replied, at once growing serious again. "I was simply thinking over my superlative folly of having suffered myself to grow excited in our conversation. I presume it was that thought that made me smile, for it is truly foolish to lose our temper over any thing that we may hear, see or know of our fellow-men. I should not have lost my equanimity on account of Edgar's enemies, for I know the world by bitter experience, and nothing that is wrong, villainous and criminal of her, should now surprise me more." 
                  "And is then the world so bad?" she inquired, a perceptible tremor in her voice, her face slightly growing paler. 
                  "There is scarcely one truly honest man to be found among a thousand." 
                  "I hope-I know-you are in error," now Nellie replied, with firmness. 'Tis true I'm young, but still I have had also some little experience with the world, and I have never found her half so bad as you fain would make me believe she is. I apprehend that you have come in contact with some few mean, bad persons, and now you deem the rest no better. Is it not so?" 
                  "I have come in contact with some very, very bad men," Reuben replied, growing more serious, "and I must confess, had I no better opinion of the rest of men, I should sooner sleep and make my home with tigers than be among them." 
                  "You hate the world?" 
                  "I do." 
                  It was useless for him to say so. The frown on his-at other times calm, but now scowling-brow, the peculiar glance from the dark pupils of his eyes, the bitter curl on his sharp thin lips-the whole expression of his countenance said, in one accord, 
                  "I hate the world!" 
                  "Edgar loves the world," Nellie replied, "and I am sure he has much cause for complaint. He never censured any one for any thing, and was always ready to excuse the wrong deed and pity the wrong-doer." 
                  "Edgar always was and I presume is still too sentimental for this prosaic world," Reuben remarked. "Being good himself, he thinks the rest of men no worse." 
                  Here the conversation was interrupted by the sound of the door-bell. Nellie did not wait until a servant would answer the call, but, after uttering a hasty excuse, sped from the room. A moment later, Reuben could hear her voice from without, begging some one to come in, who, however, declined doing so. It was something like five minutes before she returned. When she had once more taken her seat, Reuben observed that she had been shedding tears during her brief stay in the ball. She was much crestfallen, and her whole behavior was so changed that he could not help noticing it. She was no longer lively, but very sad, and had lost that ease and freedom which she had exhibited previous to retiring. Her head was now bent forward, and there was something thoughtful upon her brow. Once, just as she had entered and taken her seat, she raised her eyes and met those of Reuben. A blush rose to her cheeks, but her lips turned white. She offered a hasty excuse for having absented herself so long, then paused, at the same time lowering her head as if something was troubling her. 
                  Reuben thought it high time to take his leave. He judged others by himself. Mr. Montgomery's daughter was to him no longer the laughing, bright-eyed, golden-haired, rosy-cheeked, dimple-faced, mischief-loving Nellie, but a young girl whose heart already nourished a sorrow which could extinguish the light in her eyes, and steal the roses and dimples from her cheeks. She being in trouble, he would leave her to herself, as he had no desire to read her secrets. He therefore rose from his seat to say "Good-night." As he did so, Nellie raised her head and looked intently into his eyes. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she said, in a tremulous voice, "I do not want you to leave me yet, unless my company has grown too tiresome for you to endure. Besides, it is still early, and father and mother have not yet returned." 
                  Seeing that Reuben remained silent, as if undecided how to act, she continued, after a short pause: 
                  "If you would be kind enough to sit down once more, I should make bold to ask you for some advice." 
                  Reuben, as requested, sat down, and then Nellie proceeded, scarcely able to conceal her embarrassment: 
                   
                  "You are acquainted with Mr. Lionel Harrington?" 
                  "I am, Miss Nellie." 
                  "It was he who was just at the door." 
                  Reuben had no reply to make to this, so he suffered her to proceed without interruption. 
                  "Yes, it was Lionel who was at the door," she continued, her eyes looking toward the floor. "He said he was in trouble, and that he wanted to see father. But I am afraid father won't help him any more;" and here Nellie began to shed tears. 
                  "It is useless to weep, Miss Nellie," Reuben remarked, consolingly, "for tears will not help the matter. Perhaps, if I were acquainted with the nature of his troubles, I might be able to help him to overcome them." 
                  "I know you will not reveal any thing that I shall tell you," she said. 
                  "As I am a gentleman, you may depend upon my silence and secrecy." 
                  "Lionel and I love one another," she said, almost in a whisper, her cheeks reddening. 
                  "I can see nothing wrong in that." 
                  "Nor did father, until lately." 
                  "And why only since lately?" he inquired. 
                  "Because father has lately found out that he drinks very hard, and loses all his money at card-playing." 
                  "Mr. Harrington should think better of himself than thus to trifle with his reputation and his future." 
                  "I have told him so a thousand times, Mr. Armhold," she said, sorrowfully; "but, notwithstanding all his promises to reform, he still gets drunk and gambles. He has just told me that if father does not advance him two thousand dollars at once, he will be worse than a disgraced man by to-morrow. I have sent him to father, but I know Lionel will not get the money, for he has already borrowed one thousand dollars, which should have been paid before this time." 
                  "For your sake, Miss Nellie, I shall assist him." 
                  Nellie rose from her seat, and threw herself upon her knees before him. The tears of sorrow in her eyes changed to tears of gratitude, and once more a smile stole over her cheeks. All her troubles were forgotten in an instant, and she was again the happy, guileless girl of sixteen. 
                  Reuben could scarcely comprehend this hasty transformation-how grief could be so quickly forgotten. 
                  Now she rose from her knees, and sat down by his side. 
                  "You will assist him, then?" she said. "O, you are so kind and good! He will ever be grateful to you for it; for, despite his bad habits and recklessness, he has a good heart, and would die for those who serve him. But how will you manage it, so that he does not discover that I have told you of it?" 
                  "Leave that to me, Miss Nellie; and rest assured you shall not be betrayed. But, as you have told me this much, pray tell me more. Who are his companions at play?" 
                  Nellie hesitated. 
                  "I ask not for the sake of gratifying idle curiosity," Reuben said. 
                  "I do not know but one by name," Nellie said, after a pause. 
                  "And who is he?" Reuben inquired, eagerly. 
                  "The Reverend Doctor Broadwell." 
                  As these words fell upon Reuben's ears, a malicious smile passed momentarily over his features, and then they turned again as hard and stiff as if carved into a face of granite. A threatening scowl sat upon his brow, and an iron, immovable will could be read in the whole expression of his countenance. Reuben was again transformed into the hardened convict. Revenge-revenge was in his mind, and a determination to have it was written indelibly in every single lineament of his countenance. 
                  Nellie shuddered as she looked upon him. 
                  Reuben saw that he was making her feel uneasy, but he cared not for it. He was too much taken up with what he had heard, to heed or give his attention to any thing else. He rose from his chair, picked up his hat, and said, in a clear, deep voice: 
                  "Miss Nellie, rest easy. I have promised you to save Mr. Harrington. I shall be true to my promise. Good-night." 
                  So saying, he left the room and retired to his own. For some time Nellie sat alone, without raising her head. She had fallen into a deep reverie, from which she was only aroused by the arrival of her parents. 
                  "Daughter," said Mr. Montgomery, after his wife had retired to her own room, "I must have a serious word with you." 
                  Nellie shrank within herself as she replied: 
                  "What is it, 'pa?" 
                  "Lionel came here this evening, after I had left?" 
                  "He did, 'pa," the girl replied, trembling. 
                  "I have seen him since." 
                  Nellie thought it unnecessary to reply, and her father continued: 
                  "He wanted to borrow two thousand dollars, but I refused him the loan." 
                  Nellie still kept silent. 
                  "I have also told him not to cross my threshold again until I am convinced of his reformation. And what do you think his answer was? Nellie, he cursed me, and said that if I were not an old man, he would give me a sound thrashing." 
                  Mr. Montgomery rose from his chair and took a position before the window, with his back toward his daughter. 
                  "'Pa," Nellie ventured to say, as she walked up to him, "he must ask your pardon." 
                  "My pardon!" interrupted the old man, quickly turning around, and sternly looking at his pleading daughter. "My pardon! Do you think-" 
                  "O, 'pa!" and she began to sob. 
                  "Do you think I would suffer such a boy to beard me?" 
                  "He was drunk, 'pa, else he would not have spoken as he did." 
                  "He had no business to get drunk." 
                  "I know it." 
                  "Why, then, do you excuse him?" 
                  "I do not excuse him, 'pa; but he was drunk and irritated." 
                  "Nellie!" he now said, abruptly, "I have forbidden him my house; I have also told him never more to speak to you; and now you must promise me to have nothing more to do with him, should he presume to go contrary to my wishes." 
                  "Father!" she faltered. 
                  "Lionel Harrington has insulted the gray hair upon my head. Besides, he is a bankrupt, and, worse than that, a drunkard and a gambler!" 
                  "I promise, father." 
                  "That's spoken like a good daughter," and the old gentleman pressed a kiss upon Nellie's brow. 
                  Shortly after both retired-Mr. Montgomery satisfied at having done his duty as a parent, and Nellie heart-broken on account of the promise she had given him. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Is there no forest 
                              Whose shades are dark enough to shelter us? 
                              Or cavern rifted by the perilous lightning, 
                              Where we must grapple with the tenanting wolf 
                              To earn our bloody lair? There let us hide, 
                              Nor hear the voice of man nor call of Heaven. 
                           
                         
                        MATURIN'S "BERTRAM." 
                      
                   
                  IT was not until the clock had struck eleven, on the following morning, that Lionel Harrington returned home. No sooner was he in the hall than a servant approached him, asking him into his sister's room. 
                  "Why, what's up?" he inquired, by no means pleased with the request; and he passed along without waiting for an answer. The servant followed him slowly until they both had arrived in front of the stairs, when Lionel abruptly turned around and inquired, 
                  "Where is Carrie?" 
                  "In her room-sick." 
                  At this information the angry frown that had rested, like a dark shadow, upon Lionel's brow, gave way to an expression of sadness and dejection. He heaved a heavy sigh-it was the first the servant or any one else had ever heard of him-shook his head, and then, followed by the girl, ascended the stairs. 
                  "Tell Carrie I shall be with her instantly," and he dismissed the servant. 
                  Five minutes afterward, brother and sister were once more together in the latter's room. Carrie was lying on the sofa, and Lionel was standing in front of her, looking down upon her sad, sweet face. 
                  "Where have you been all night, Lionel?" she said, faintly, at the same time raising herself to a sitting posture, and begging him to sit down by her side. 
                  "I went back to the city, sister, after our interview last night," he said, trying to smile. "Late as it was, I had still to attend to some business which I had neglected to perform during the day, the transaction of which would have been too late had I postponed it until this morning. But you look unusually pale," he added, trying to change the topic of their conversation; "are you sick, Carrie?" Here he took hold of her ice-cold hand and pressed it warmly. 
                  Instead of answering, she threw her head upon his bosom, and began to sob aloud. 
                  "O, Lionel, Lionel, what will become of us?" she shrieked in anguish, almost falling into hysterics. 
                  "Carrie, for God's sake don't arouse the servants by your crying!" he said, hoarsely, suppressing but poorly his own emotions. "I don't know what has got into your head of late to make you so unaccountably uneasy and fearful. Have you not all you could possibly desire? Is there any thing wanting? Say so, and you shall have it." 
                  Instead of consoling her, this last remark had the effect to make her weep the more. Lionel could no longer look upon that sight of misery with calmness. It was his sister who wept, sobbed, and felt wretched; and now he pressed her closer to his heart, and mingled his tears with hers. For some time neither spoke; Carrie, however, was the first to break the silence. She freed herself from her brother's embrace, raised her sad face to his, and said: 
                  "Let us be candid with each other, Lionel. O, do not reserve any thing from your sister! You see how cold the world has grown toward us; even our best friends have forsaken us now. I am sure that we have been kind to some-unselfishly kind-and even they have deserted us. You can see now how cold and bad the world is. If you and I have erred-to err is human-at least to our friends we have always been firm and true; and now, to be deserted and discarded by them, shows what little reliance we should place in professions of love and friendship in the future. Therefore, let us be candid with one another." 
                  Carrie paused for a moment, and then she added, somewhat louder and with more firmness: 
                  "Lionel, I watched you last night, and overheard part of the conversation which you held with Broadwell at the outer gate." 
                  An expression of pain and surprise came over Lionel's features. It was some time before he could gather his scattered senses and utter a word. When he did speak, it was with considerable embarrassment and hesitancy. 
                  "You know, then, how wicked I have grown in my desperation?" he said, while a blush of shame covered his face. 
                  "I have heard but part," she replied. "Now, Lionel, put your sister's mind at rest, and tell her all. See, she is calm." 
                  And Carrie was calm. 
                  "Sister, I will be brief," said Lionel; "I shall not dwell long upon this subject, for it is too unpleasant. I can relate it in a few words. One month ago I had lost at play more money than I could raise. I tried to borrow it from a hundred different parties, but was unsuccessful. I could not obtain it, and was compelled to have it, or risk a public exposure. What was to be done under these circumstances? I was perplexed-more than perplexed. I grew desperate. I forged notes to the amount of two thousand dollars on Broadwell, hoping to be able to meet them before they should fall due. Carrie, the notes fell due this morning-" 
                  "And-" Carrie interrupted. 
                  "Broadwell met them without exposing me," continued Lionel, without looking from the floor. 
                  "Lionel!" 
                  "Carrie!" 
                  "Under what conditions did he meet them?" 
                  "Upon no conditions." 
                  "Lionel, keep nothing back from me, but tell me all. You see I am strong, and can hear the worst." 
                  "Sister, first forgive me." 
                  "You are forgiven. What are the conditions he exacted?" 
                  "Had he exposed me," continued Lionel, "and prosecuted me, I should have been sentenced to the penitentiary for having committed forgery." 
                  A perceptible shiver passed through Carrie's lithe frame, and her face turned as pale as death. 
                  "To the penitentiary!" she exclaimed. 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Can he still bring you there?" she whispered, faintly, her heart almost breaking in her bosom. 
                  "He can," Lionel replied, still looking down. 
                  "Will he?" 
                  "Not as long as you are kind to him." 
                  "Thank God! thank God!" now Carrie shrieked, once more throwing herself upon her brother's bosom. "Fear not, Lionel, you shall live and be safe, for what is such a sister's honor when compared to such a brother's life? Let Broadwell come and claim his slave!" 
                  Lionel did not desire to hear more. He rose and hurried from the room, a strange, wild gleam shooting from his eyes. He had sacrificed his sister's honor to save his unworthy self! 'Twas still time, he thought, to rescue Carrie. He would do it at his own peril. He was once more a man, once more a brother. Sooner would he die than see so noble a sister wronged. He would go to Broadwell and tell him his resolution. 
                  Fifteen minutes later he was on his horse bound for the city. Carrie espied him from the window. She called to him, and he returned. When he arrived at the house door she was already there. 
                  "You are not returning to the city?" she said, apprehensively. 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Lionel, you must stay here." 
                  "Carrie, I must to the city." 
                  "Lionel," she repeated, the blood rushing to her cheeks, and a light of determination shining in her eyes, "go if you wish, but on your return expect to find me a corpse. Now do as you please." And she walked back into the hall. 
                  Lionel looked at her for a moment, then alighted from his horse and followed her steps. When he caught up with her-that was just as she was about entering her own room-he took her by her arm and retained her on the door-sill. 
                  "Carrie," he said, despair and madness written in every lineament of his face, "Carrie, I want you to recall your words. Do you hear me? I want you to recall your words at once. I must go to the city. I have to see Broadwell before it is too late." 
                  "See Broadwell about what?" she said abruptly. 
                  "About the promise I have given him," he answered. 
                  "What promise have you given him?" 
                  "I can't tell you, sister. It makes me mad to think of it. Therefore do not ask me, but give me leave to go to the city, and, when I return, it shall be to inform you of my success." 
                  "Lionel, come into my room." 
                  They went in and sat down, side by side. After looking one another in the eye, Carrie continued: 
                  "Who has these forged notes in possession now?" 
                  "Broadwell." 
                  "Can you get them from him if you pay him the sum they call for?" she inquired. 
                  Lionel hesitated. She saw it and repeated the question. 
                  "I fear he will not give them up," he answered reluctantly. 
                  "And are you in his power as long as he retains them?" 
                  "Yes," he replied, in a low, hoarse voice. 
                  "And can prosecute you whenever he chooses?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  A halt. A long, long pause. Neither felt like speaking. Again Carrie was the first to break the silence. 
                  "You say Broadwell wants my favors?" 
                  "Yes." 
                   
                  "Lionel! Go not to the city; remain here. It is your sister's wish. Broadwell will make his appearance ere long. I want you to entertain him-when he does come-until I shall be ready to give him audience." 
                  "What then?" 
                  "What then? Leave that to me. Both your honor and my name shall be saved. I have the means to do it with, and I shall make use of them." 
                  "Carrie, this is all nonsense," said Lionel firmly. "I shall not depend upon you. I have been the villain-now don't say any thing to extenuate this inhuman, unnatural promise of mine-to barter off your virtue to save my cowardly life. Now don't interrupt me, Carrie, for I know what you would say. Yes, I feel how degraded I am in your sight, though you are silent, and even speak not a word of reproach. But never mind this now; I was drunk and frightened to death when I agreed upon this barter. Carrie! Carrie!" and here he rose erect and proudly lifted his head, "I am sober now, and a man once more. You are an angel and I am a devil-now let me speak out. The angel subdued me, and gave me back my former pride and manliness. From this moment on, I shall be worthy of so good a sister. I fear no longer the threats of Broadwell; they fall harmless upon my ear." 
                  Just then the dog in the yard barked, and the house-bell rung. They also heard the neighing of a horse. 
                  "'Tis Broadwell, I presume," Lionel said, and crossed to the door. "I'll speak to him, Carrie; but by all means, should he wish to see you, refuse him admittance." 
                  Carrie hesitated. 
                  "Promise me!" he asked gently. 
                  "Are you not in danger?" she said faintly. 
                  "Fear nothing for me." And he left his sister. 
                  Five minutes later a servant girl entered Carrie's room and said that she should come down into the drawing-room. 
                  "Is Mr. Broadwell below?" she inquired. 
                  "No, it is a stranger, but his face is very familiar to me." 
                  Carrie descended the stairs with a throbbing heart and with an unsure step. In the hall she was met by her brother, who whispered a word into her ear. No sooner had she heard it than a wild shriek-a shriek of joy that rose from a heart of despair-escaped from her thin lips, and she rushed into the drawing-room, threw herself at the feet of the stranger, and, amid sighs and sobs, exclaimed: 
                  "God has heard my prayers, and sent us a savior!" 
                  The stranger gazed upon her for a second, then raised the weeping lady from the floor, whispering into her ears: 
                  "Your brother is saved. Here I return to you the forged notes!" And he reached them into Carrie's hand.

                              'Tis the cruel artifice of fate, 
                              Thus to refine and vary on our woes, 
                              To raise us from despair, and give us hopes, 
                              Only to plunge us in the gulph again, 
                              And make us doubly wretched.

                              With what a leaden and retarding weight, 
                              Does expectation load the wing of time. 
                           
                         
                        MASON'S ALFRIDA. 
                      
                   
                  IT was a dark, gloomy November morning. A fine, drizzly rain, which had been gently falling during the whole of the previous day and night had been succeeded by one of those cold, sharp, freezing mists, which, in this climate, and at this season of the year, like an impenetrable, gray vail, ushers in the morning, and hides in a thick, immovable cloud, both earth and Heaven. It was past ten o'clock, and still the excluded rays of the sun had not yet succeeded in penetrating and sending their warmth and light through that mighty sea of watery vapor, that hung suspended in the atmosphere, like the out-stretched wings of the angel of Obscurity. Already before day-break, the faithful Jane, at the wish of her mistress, had built a warm fire in the family's sitting-room-the room in which Hannah had of late, been spending, all alone, the most of her time. 
                  On this particular morning, she had risen earlier than she was wont to, and glided, more like a phantom than a human being, from her bed-chamber into the one cozily prepared and kept pleasantly heated for her, by her servant. Arrived there, and having for some time after alternately gazed through the moistened window-panes and walked thoughtfully up and down the room, she drew an easy-chair near the hearth and seated herself upon it, and began abstractedly to watch the graceful flames as they sporting shot, rosy and laughing, from the heart of the fuel they consumed. As she sat there, in the light thus emitted, though an ordinary observer might not have seen in that cold, pale face the least change in its aspect, a man who had made Nature his study through life, would not have been slow in detecting in those slumbering features, in the peculiarly relaxative curve of her whitish lips, in the soft clear blue of those chastened eyes, in the scarcely-discoverable declining of her head, in the graceful abandon and easy drooping of the rounded shoulder, unmistakable signs of a severe struggle through which she must have past, a struggle that must have swayed her innerself, like the mighty upheaving of a tempestuous ocean. 
                  Never before had she been so beautiful as she appeared now in her morning attire. She had fought with herself for twelve long, long hours-fought with herself from sunset to sunrise-and had sustained defeat. A doubt as to the justness of her past conduct toward her husband had intruded itself upon her mind, and like a reproving witness it had called up, and kept before her inner eye, the whole long, long night through, the many incidents in which Edgar had shone brighter than the stars themselves, and had seemed even purer, chaster, than the unflecked moon around which they sparkled. She had labored hard to silence-to reason away that unwelcome doubt; but all her efforts to prove her conduct proper had seemed rather to conspire against her than otherwise, and had made the fearless foe even louder in his defense of Edgar, and more scathing in his accusations against herself. Like a heroine, she had struggled and fought; but her foe had grown stronger and more invincible in this mind-confined midnight encounter, and she had fallen-but not until all her resources had been exhausted-a victim bereft of all her weapons-convinced of her weakness and insignificance. Not until then, and only then for the first time in her wedded life, had she had the courage calmly, and like an impartial judge upon the bench of justice, to weigh and scrutinize her own conduct and actions; and only after she had passed-a second time-through the various windings of her ill-fated married life, had she discovered how great the enormity of her crime of which her own conscience had declared her guilty before its own tribunal. A light had at once sprung up in her mind, and had shown her, one by one, the thousand wrongs she had inflicted, without the slightest cause or provocation, on a man who had loved her better than life itself. Never before had she looked upon her conduct from the same point of view as she had done then; and only then had been astonished-aye, amazed-at her utter blindness to her persistence in plunging her husband deeper and deeper in misery. During the long twelve hours she had not slept a minute, and when she had risen from her couch, she was as sleepless as if she had passed through the sweetest of rest. 
                  We said, never before had she been so beautiful as she appeared now, seated before the hearth, her calm features palely lighted up by the glowing embers in the grate. Her pride, her courage, her self-will had deserted her, and a peculiar meekness and resignation had taken possession of her soul, and softened down and beautiful still more her already superlatively-beautiful features. She knew now that she had done wrong; she knew it, and the knowledge of this fact, as its light broke upon her mind, showed her how irretrievably lost she had become. But she did not pine; she did not grieve. The error had once been committed, and there was an end of it. She would have to suffer, but she also felt herself equal to it. A woman lofty in nature and strong in misfortune, she simply and graciously yielded to her destiny and bowed her head in meekness. Calm and composed, as all great characters who are conscious of the suffering that await them, she reconciled herself to the fate she had prepared for her own future, without upraiding herself for what she had done, and was now beyond recall. Reverend Dr. Broadwell, who had insidiously instilled into her mind the poison, from the effect of which she was now suffering, was at that moment forgotten; his words were forgotten; his advice, which, to her sorrow, she had too faithfully followed, was forgotten; all and every thing was pardoned and forgotten, and nothing lived in her mind but the result of the Past: the thought that she had driven her husband away from his home; that she had robbed her child of his father. She averted her gaze from the playful smoke-cloudlets she had been watching for nearly two hours, and raised her eyes toward the window fronting the street. The dark mist was still unbroken, enveloping the atmosphere in a drizzly cloud of gloom. Heaving a sigh, so faintly that her own ears could scarcely catch the sound, she once more looked into the bright flames sporting with the embers, and suffered another hour to steal away in half-matured and unconnected thoughts. 
                  The clock on the mantel was just striking ten, when Jane entered and approached her mistress with a letter in hand, saying: 
                  "It was at the-" 
                  Before she had had time to complete the sentence, Hannah, with a bright glow mounted on her temples, and a strange fire burning in her eyes, had risen from her seat, had snatched the long envelope from her servant's hands, with the words: "From Edgar!" and big drops of water-too big to be named tears-struggled for a moment in those eyes of blue, then rolled down her cheeks, which had assumed their natural pale color again, and fell upon the envelope, upon the face of which, in the handwriting, Hannah knew too well to be that of her husband, her eyes, though deeply submerged in water, could make out her own name. Jane remained not to see the sequel; after stirring up the embers and placing on the fire some more fresh fuel, she, knowing her services no longer needed, and sympathizing with her mistress, retired with that grace and good breeding so commendable in a good servant. 
                  What was Hannah doing in the mean time? She had seated herself at the small table which was placed in the center of the room, had calmly laid the still unopened letter upon its marble slab, and was thoughtfully looking down upon it. Not a muscle stirred on her face; not a breath seemed to escape her lips; while her elbow rested upon the table, and the small, white palm of her hand supported her elegantly rounded chin. What was it that threw her in this brown study, and dulled the edge of her curiosity-for eager to know the letter's contents she must have been-to learn what her husband had to say? Was it an indifference-a want of importance she attached to the information she might gain-that caused her to abstain from breaking the seal? Circumstances, and a knowledge of her character, warrant us to negative the question. What else could it have been that kept her so indisposed to move or to act? Could it have been fear? We know FEAR was not a part of her composition; and if it had been, the state of her mind was such, and her hopes already so far gone, that the very worst the letter might have contained could not have crushed her more than she already was. 
                  It was rather the thought of being about to be ushered into her future-a future she had painted to herself in the darkest shades of misery, but still had not yet seen, and as yet was only living in her mind. But now she needed but to remove a seal, and in the handwriting of her own husband-the very man who held her destiny in his power-she could read her crime and condemnation. Like the hunted stag, when confronted by a deep abyss, before he takes the dangerous leap, in fearless grandeur stands at bay a moment, then hurls himself down, down into the dark and yawning depth: so she, in this last stage of wretchedness, apprehending, as if by intuition, the final death-blow to her already shattered peace, a moment paused to retrospect, then in oblivion hurled the past, and calmly turned to embrace the future, whatever that future might have in store for her. 
                  Simply moistening her thin lips, she raised the letter from the table, and after retaining it quietly between her fingers for a moment, broke the seal, and from the envelope drew two separate manuscripts. One was in the handwriting of her husband; the other she perceived to be in that of a stranger. Free from excitement or the least nervousness, without changing or moving a single muscle of her features, she, after having laid aside the brief, unfolded her husband's note and began to read, or at least appeared to read, its contents. For nearly fifteen minutes her eyes were turned upon these lines, when at last, as if a chill had overtaken her, her whole frame began to shake. It lasted but a minute, and this tremor, which seemed to have passed through all her joints, had again forsaken her. She was once more calm, and her features-as if in death-changed not their expression. Her eyes were no longer turned down, but upward; they were raised toward that window opposite her, behind which the mist-encumbered morning frowned upon her. In erecting her body, her chest seemed to expand and grow larger; but her breath came as slow and regular as if it courted sweetest sleep. Apparently, a gentle calmness pervaded her whole being. She did not drop the paper, but with a steady hand laid it beside the other on the table. A moment later she was on her feet, making a slow round from one extremity of the room to the other. The lines she had just read seemed to have thrown her mind back into a train of thoughts which, like a finger of ice, touched her unruffled brow, and gave it that freezing look which the silver cloud at midnight wears while sailing through the deep-blue Arctic sky. Her eyes were cast downward, and her cheeks, which were always pale and colorless, grew still paler; while her tiny, classic, lovely nose-the most perfect of her perfect features-seemed to grow longer, thinner, and more transparent. Thus, nothing lost in native grace and beauty, she at last sat down by the fire, in front of the hearth, meekly and pensively lowering her head upon her elbow, and blankly gazing into the flames. 
                  Not until the clock upon the mantel had struck twelve, did she raise her eyes and fully arouse herself from her reverie. Slowly passing the palm of her left hand across her cold, translucently pure forehead, and heaving a faint sigh, the chair was deserted, and after another slow walk, which lasted for several minutes, she posted herself before the window. The heavy fog, which had enveloped the whole atmosphere, had risen upward, and now, from a dark, leaden heaven, in fine, silvery drops, returned to sprinkle mother earth. Hannah watched with a peculiar interest the succession of rain-drops, as they noiselessly descended upon the window-panes. In this manner she spent another fifteen minutes, when the door of the opposite house was opened from the inside, and her neighbor and his wife stepped forth upon the pavement-he opening out and raising over his wife's head an umbrella to shield her from the falling rain, while she, full of pride and confidence, placed her arm in his, uplifted her happy face, lit up by an inward joy, and almost riveted herself to his side. Hannah, who had seen them issue from the house, and had observed their subsequent conduct, now intently watched their progress as they, side by side, like two made one, briskly braved the weather, and walked down the street. No sooner were they out of sight than she heaved a long sigh, which was followed by another, and another, each succeeding one heavier, sadder, and longer than the one preceding it. 
                  She left the window. Another change was visible in her face, as she again walked up and down the room. Her eyes had grown dull, and lacked the light of life and sensibility; an intellectual inattention had dulled the expression of her sleeping features, and an all-pervading, indefinable stupor seemed to have relaxed the very action of her muscles. And yet there was something stony in the aspect of that face. The very lips seemed calm and set, not as if an inward struggle had straightened them out and sharpened their curves, but rather as if they had helped to subdue a painful feeling, and by so doing had lost life, but retained, in their straight lines and attitude, a show of that nerve and strength which they had expended. 
                  Tired of pacing the floor, Hannah once more sat down by the fire; but this time she closed her eyelids, as if to shut out thoughts of the outer world. When Jane entered, shortly afterward, it struck two o'clock, at the sound of which Hannah raised her head and opened wide her eyes. 
                  "Where am I?" she whispered, as if awakened from a trance. 
                  The self-put query had scarcely been uttered, before it was followed by a sad shake of her head, and a long-drawn sigh from her breast. 
                  Jane, who in the mean time had advanced to the middle of the room, now informed her mistress that dinner was on the table and waiting for her. 
                  "I do not feel like eating any thing now, Jane," Hannah replied, in a low, but steady voice; "I will call for you when I shall be hungry. Where is my child?" 
                  "Little Emil is in the nursery with Maggie." Then, after a short pause: "May I not bring you a small plate of soup, Miss Hannah?" 
                  "No, not now, Jane;" and Hannah once more lowered her head and supported it on her arm. Jane added some fuel to the fire, and then retired as noiselessly as she had entered. 
                   
                  It would be no less useless than difficult to follow, even inaccurately, the train of thoughts passing through Hannah's mind. Even the feelings that the sight of her neighbors, as they left their house, had awakened in her bosom, were, if not undefinable, at least undefined by her. In all probability, they opened still more her eyes to her own misery, and deposited in her mind a full portion of their bitter alloy with the compound of conquered self-reproach and grief subdued already lingering there. Again she rose to her feet, and again she paced the floor. The letter she had received was still lying on the table, and her eyes caught a glimpse of it as she passed. Two minutes later she had slowly retraced her steps, taken a seat by that table, and was holding that paper in her hands. Long and abstractedly she gazed at it, until, at last, her lips growing whiter, her features more set, and the color of her face paler and more transparent, she laid it aside, and, after placing a sheet of note-paper before her and taking up a pen, suffered her head to seek support on her left arm, while her gaze was thoughtfully turned toward the window, behind which the drizzly rain-drops still fell monotonously on the panes. Some one passing through the long, echoing corridor made her start within herself and recall her wandering thoughts. Waiting, in a listening attitude, until the noise had subsided, she once more looked down upon the letter, and, as she did so, her lips, almost involuntarily, repeated, in a whisper, its contents, which were as follows: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 NEW YORK, PRESCOTT HOUSE, November 12, 18-.
                                 
                               
                              DEAR HANNAH: Presuming you to be in possession of the few lines I was bold to send you on yesterday, and not desiring to take up your time unnecessarily, I will at once, without the least digression, state to you the object of this writing. Having just received from my attorney (whom I had engaged for the purpose of writing out for me an instrument to enable you to obtain a divorce, and of which I have apprised you in my note of yesterday,) the enclosed document, and not knowing, owing to the state of my still-failing health, what the morrow may bring forth, I hasten to forward it to your address at once. Be not surprised, my dear Hannah, suffer me to call you yet, for once, by this sweet name-at this strange self-accusation of a crime of which, however, you must think-you must know-me innocent. I knew of no other method by which your freedom could have been so speedily and so easily purchased! I have cheerfully done what I did, and only hope that the step I took will be the cause of brightening your future. I am no longer now an obstacle between yourself and happiness. On the 24th of this month I shall leave on the "DESTINY," for California. Bless you, bless you, Hannah; forgive and forget me, and be as true and loving to my boy as his father ever has been to you. 
                              
                                 Yours, for the last time, 
                                 EDGAR ARMHOLD.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  The lips moved no longer: they closed up, hard upon one another, lending her face an expression of a fixed determination. The letter was laid back upon the table, and the other-the lawyer's document-picked up instead. She did not open it, however. She did not read it. Rising from her seat, compressing her lips still closer, she walked, with a stately mien, straight across the room, then stopped in front of the hearth. Without moving a muscle in her face, or changing the expression of a single feature, she consigned the document to the flames, then, with as stately a mien and as graceful a step, once more returned to her seat by the table. 
                  Her mind seemed to be fully made up, for she at last picked up the pen, and, without a moment's reflection, began to write the following: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 CINCINNATI, November 14, 18-.
                               
                              MR. EDGAR ARMHOLD-Dear Sir: Your lines, under date of the 12th instant-the first and only ones that have come to hand since your departure-and the accompanying instrument, have just reached me. In reply, permit me to remark, sir, that I am prepared to accept the fate the future may have in store for me. You have deserted me-perhaps I am not justified in complaining-but I shall not murmur at this, the severest visitation of my life. No doubt but what I have been a grievous sinner, else the wrath of Heaven would not have fallen upon me so heavily. I bow my head in humility, and shall meekly bear my cross. 
                              The instrument which accompanied your lines is ashes. I have not read it, but, was, unopened, consigned to the flames. I know that I am mean, and that you think me mean; but, although you have gone away from me, I shall never wear any other name than that the wife of Mr. Edgar Armhold should wear. Perhaps I have not been a good companion to you, and have given you great cause for the step you have taken. In fact, I know I have; I have done you wrong. But this is past, sir, and beyond recall. If I have not been dutiful, before, I shall be now, Mr. Armhold. You determined upon leaving me; I shall not raise my voice against your action. You are my husband still, and I the wife who has sworn to love and obey you. Go where you will, sir, the honor of Edgar Armhold shall be safe in my keeping. His son shall learn to love and respect his father, and find me a better mother than I have been a wife. 
                              I will not trouble you further; I feel that I have offended you beyond the reach of pardon. I therefore do not ask it. Good by, Mr. Armhold; good b- 
                               
                              Here, a spasmodic movement contorted her features; her lips began to quiver, and her teeth to grind and chatter. "I can't go on," she burst out aloud, threw down the pen, and lowering her head upon the table, gave full vent to her pent-up emotions and wept aloud. 
                              The wind had risen in the mean time, and was sending its howls and wails through the heavy atmosphere; the rain was still spattering the window-panes. Her mind was too much pre-occupied to heed, hear or see any thing. She simply wept. She did not try to control her emotions, until she had unburthened her heart, when she once more raised her head and dried her tearful eyes. Again she took hold of the pen, and again she was prepared for continuing her almost complete correspondence. Having reflected for a moment, her face wearing a beautiful calm, she added: 
                              -No, Edgar, I can not say good-by to you: I can not. O, come back to me, my husband, so I may fall upon my knees and ask your forgiveness. Full well I know how deeply I have sinned against you-against you, the very best of men. Have pity on me-on me, your Hannah. You did love me once; O, let me appeal to you by that love, and entreat you to come back, to come back, to come back to me again. You know not how wretched I am! what is a wife whose husband has deserted her! A frail weed at the mercy of every wind. Never until now have I felt how weak, infirm and forsaken a woman is, who has lost her rightful protector. I must have been possessed, mad-yes, mad, Edgar, to have acted as I did. But you will forgive me. I know you will. What wrong would Edgar Armhold not forgive his wife? 
                              And then our little Emil, he is your boy; your innocent, harmless little boy. He will ask me, when he is grown, what has become of his father, and why he had left his house and home. Your Hannah-his mother-how shall she answer him? She can not tell him that she had driven forth his father; that she had made his life a torture to him. No, no, she can not tell this to him-to my boy-and call herself a mother. For if I would confess to him my crime he would curse-O, Edgar, Edgar, come back to me. 
                              
                                 Your loving wife, 
                                 HANNAH.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Now she laid the pen aside and rose to her feet. No tears where in her eyes, no sigh escaped her lips. A peculiar calm had stolen over her features, softened down their expression, and lent them a sweetness and beauty the most vivid description would beggar. She had confessed her wrong-pleaded guilty, and felt relieved. Edgar would return: she knew he would come back, and forgive her as only a noble heart can forgive. 
                  The door opened, and Jane noiselessly entered the room. "May I bring you a plate o' soup, now?" she asked, in a voice full of kindness. 
                  "Yes, Jane, do please." And the faithful servant withdrew. 
                  Hannah retraced her steps and sat down at the table. The note she had written was folded and carefully placed in an envelope, which she sealed and addressed: 
                        MR. EDGAR ARMHOLD, PRESCOTT HOUSE, Yew York City.
                     
                   
                  Just then Jane re-entered with a plate of soup. "Thank you," said Hannah, and began to partake of her meal. When finished, she returned the empty plate, with a faint smile, remarking that she had been hungry-right hungry-and that the soup was good. 
                  "Will you have some more?" inquired the girl, feeling happy at the smile that had greeted her. "Or, perhaps a small piece of roast beef?" she added. 
                  "No, no, Jane; this will do for the present. Now go, and bring my boy to me." 
                  When the servant re-entered, some five minutes later, with a child-a laughing, bright-eyed boy of something like two summers-on her arm, she found Hannah seated by the hearth. 
                  "Emil, my boy," the kind mother fondly said, as she pressed him to her heart, and covered him with kisses. "Don't you love your mamma? Don't you, my dear?" 
                  The baby-boy smiled an answer, and nestled still closer to his mother's bosom. 
                  "And then you do love me?" Hannah repeated softly, and tears filled her eyes, as in maternal pride, she gazed upon the laughing boy. "O, Jane," she said, after she had feasted for some time upon the sight, "I have almost forgotten. Go, take this letter-you'll find it on you table-to the postoffice. But come back soon." 
                  When Jane was about to withdraw, Hannah, for the first time since the morning, heard the howling, hissing and moaning wind, that had fearfully increased within the last hour. 
                  "You can not go out in this way, Jane," she said, looking at the latter's scanty dressing. "You'll freeze. Hear how the wind blows! To go out so thinly clad could not but make the hardiest of us sick. Here, open my wardrobe." 
                  "Why, Miss Hannah? I have warmer clothes down stairs." 
                  "But you have no warmer shawl. I know you have not. Now be still and take mine. When Mr. Armhold returns from New York, he will purchase me another." 
                  "I oughtn't, Miss Hannah," Jane was about to insist, but a glance of her mistress convinced her of the futility of refusing, and she went to the wardrobe and helped herself to Hannah's cashmere-shawl. 
                  The reader who has followed the author through the Second Part of this novel, may still remember that the first letter which Edgar, after his arrival in New York, had written to Hannah, and in which he had informed her of his willingness to a divorce, and for which intent he would forward her the requisite papers, had fallen into the hands-not of Mrs. Armhold herself-but in those of the Reverend Doctor Broadwell. He had no sooner been in possession of said letter, than his mind was made up that the document of which Edgar had spoken in it, should also fall into his hands. Fearful of accident-such as Hannah herself sending to the postoffice-he had been twice on the previous day at the "General Delivery," but had been informed that up to that time nothing for Mrs. Edgar Armhold had reached it. On this morning-as chance would have it-he had felt too unwell-having a severe cold-to leave the house as early as it was his wont. So it struck two o'clock before he was seen to hurry from his lodging. His first business was to go to the postoffice. Imagine his disappointment when the clerk, after the former's usual inquiry for a letter for Mrs. Armhold, informed him that such a letter had been received by him, and delivered as early as nine o'clock this morning, to some lady who had called for it. 
                  Without saying a word he turned around, left the office, and walked up Fourth-street. He felt uneasy-was even angry with himself. He mentally upraided himself for staying at home, like a spoiled child, simply on account of a cold, when so much depended on the letter which would have fallen into his hands, had he, as he should have done and was his wont to do, gone to the office right after the receipts and distribution of the Eastern mail. He bit his lips in anger. Might there not be something in that letter which could, since it has fallen into Hannah's hands, work him harm and interfere with his nicely-laid plans? He feared so. Thus perplexed and out with himself, he was just turning the crossing on Race, when whom should he meet-but Jane, wrapped up in her mistress's warm shawl, hurrying, with her head lowered to the pavement, down Fourth street, in the direction of the postoffice. His first intention was to stop her at once; his second thought refuted the first. Jane had not yet seen him-and she should not see him. So he lowered his umbrella over his face that, if she even had looked in that direction, would not have been able to recognize him. Having done so, he suffered her to pass on, then slowly turned about face, and followed her at a little distance. 
                  A wicked smile was on his face; he felt that he was once more master of the situation-that he had again the game in his hand. 
                  He saw Jane deposit a letter in the box-saw her depart without having seen him, and he crept from behind the pillar which had served him for a hiding place, made himself sure that the girl was far enough gone, then, with a faint smile on his lips, advanced to one of the windows and asked the clerk to be good enough to hand him the letter addressed to Mr. Edgar Armhold, he had just thrown in the box, as he had made the wrong direction on the envelope. The young man whom he had addressed, suspecting nothing wrong, picked from the many letters in the basket the one applied for, and delivered it-receiving in return many thanks-to the very affable young minister, Reverend Doctor Broadwell, who ostentatiously brought to view the clear, milk-white cambric handkerchief, carefully tied around his neck. 
                  When, some thirty minutes later, Hannah was informed by her servant that she had deposited her letter in the post-office, she dreamed not that the very letter had fallen into Broadwell's hand, who was just seated in his comfortably-heated study-seated at his desk-inditing the following: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 CINCINNATI, November 14, 18-
                               
                              MR. EDGAR ARMHOLD-Sir: Yours of the 12th inst. has just come to hand. In reply, I have simply to remark that I shall, as soon as practicable, avail myself of the advantages of the document you have been considerate enough to inclose. Hoping that you will have a safe journey, and wishing you to forget me,  
                              I have the honor to be, 
                              
                                 Very respectfully, 
                                 HANNAH ARMHOLD.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  It was this letter that Edgar had received on the 17th of November, and which had prompted him to leave the Prescott House at once, and seek a more retired hotel, where he might remain undisturbed until the departure of the "DESTINY." 
                  In the mean time what was Hannah doing? She was anxiously awaiting the return of her husband; strengthening herself for the ordeal before her. Never before had she attended closer to the labors so peculiarly those of a good housewife. Her future looked once more bright, and she thanked her God who had opened her mind to her duties, and saved her from the abyss into which she had already stepped with one foot. She laughed and smiled, and treated her servant-always treated well before-with unusual kindness and forbearance. It was only when the time had expired for the return of her husband, that a peculiar uneasiness might have been discovered in her look and actions. The light faded once more from her eyes, and the smile that had nestled on her cheeks, once more retreated before the appearance of the gloomy shade her despairing heart called up. "Has Mr. Armhold not yet returned?" she would ask Jane, from time to time. "Have you been at the office? What? no letter? no answer?" And then she would throw herself upon a chair, and for hours stare at some inanimate animate object in the room, without uttering a word. 
                  In this manner, amid doubts and fears, the morning of the first of December arrived. Hannah, as usual, was alone, seated before the fire, anxiously awaiting for the mail to be brought to her by Jane. The Gazette lay upon the table. She rose and picked it up, then returned with it to her seat. Almost absent-mindedly, she scanned over its contents, until she arrived at an article headed, "DISASTER ON THE OPEN SEA!" when she at once became pale, and riveted her eyes on what followed, and which read: 
                        "THE STEAMER 'DESTINY' FOUNDERED! MANY LIVES LOST! "Edgar Armhold, the Author, Among the Missing! "ONLY A PART OF THE CREW SAVED."
                     
                   
                
                
                  CHAPTER II. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud, 
                              And after summer ever more succeeds 
                              Barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold: 
                              So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet. 
                           
                         
                        SHAKSPEARE'S "HENRY VI." 
                      
                   
                  TIME, in tracing on the mind's unfolded pages the transpiring events of each minute, dips its ever-restless quill in fading waters, gradually expunging, as it passes over those tablets, the characters, and consigning to oblivion the record, of past deeds which had been imprinted thereon. Thus joys and griefs are transitory-the only hope, the only blessing of mankind. The memory of both becomes less distinct as it recedes more and more from the PRESENT. 
                  A beautiful spring morning. 
                  Gloomy, frowning autumn had hardened into freezing, biting, pinching winter; and winter, with its snow-white, virgin face, had gradually relaxed its severity, and thrown itself into the freshly animated arms of smiling spring. The remembrance of autumn's howling wind, and of winter's nipping cold, had vanished in the enjoyment of the redolent air of May. 
                  Five months had passed over the wheel of Time. 
                  The hapless fate of the "DESTINY" was forgotten, and only those who were immediately concerned in the welfare of her now ocean-buried passengers, still remembered, and at times thought over, the event. Much sympathy as had been expressed in all societies and journals in regard to Edgar Armhold's untimely death (for his body had never been found), immediately after the sad news had been ascertained, it, like other and no less eventful circumstances, had passed from the memory and lips of man. Even Hannah had learned to reconcile herself to her fate; and as deep and poignantas her grief had been, with the coming of the spring, though the wounds in her heart were still sore and tender, the pain arising therefrom had decreased and grown more endurable. 
                  A beautiful May morning, as the Rev. Dr. Broadwell was seen to leave his office and wend his way down Ninth-street. To the casual observer he looked and appeared the same as when last we saw him, seated at his desk, some five months before, penning that fatal letter to Edgar Armhold. But to an eye better schooled, a mighty change was visible in his facial expression. That cold, hard, sinister look had disappeared, and that quick, sharp, piercing glance of his eye had grown more steady and thoughtful. His gait, too, was slower, and his whole deportment more dignified and commanding. Many who passed him saluted him by name, to which expression of respect he simply lowered his head, without moving his hat or uttering a word in reply. 
                  In the course of twenty minutes, he found himself before Mr. James Montgomery's dwelling, and shortly after was conducted into the chamber of Reuben Armhold, who was reclining on a lounge, and smoking a pure Havana cigar. 
                  We skip the salutation and introductory remarks; they differed but little from those met with in every-day life. 
                  Broadwell sat with head uncovered, and was thoughtfully looking at his nonchalant host. 
                  "I have lost again," he said, with a faint shadow passing over his calm features. 
                  "Lost again!" escaped Reuben's lips, as he watched the dark gray fume of his cigar. "You are devilish unlucky, Broadwell. How much did you lose?" 
                  "Fifteen hundred dollars." 
                  "Fifteen hundred dollars-and paid to a cent?" 
                  "I wish to heaven it were," Broadwell replied, taking out his penknife and trimming off his rosy finger-nails. "Armhold, I wish it were paid off." 
                  "You are devilish unlucky." 
                  "So I am-so I am." And a pause of several moments ensued. "You know why I came here?" he continued, the silence growing oppressive to him. "Yes, Armhold, do you know what I want?" 
                  "I think I do," Reuben replied, coolly, still watching the smoke of his cigar; "I think I do. You want money, do you not?" 
                  "I must have fifteen hundred dollars today." 
                  "From whom do you expect to borrow it?" Reuben inquired. 
                  "From you, Armhold. You have the money to spare-I know you have. Fortune has been smiling on you. Cards have not run against you as they have against me." 
                   
                  "Yes, I have been tolerably lucky of late," interposed Reuben, phlegmatically. 
                  "You have thousands upon thousands of dollars idly laid by." 
                  "Well, yes, I believe I have some money for which I have, for the present, no particular use." 
                  "Ever since we became friends, Armhold, you have shown yourself ready to serve me. You will not disappoint me this time?" 
                  "Broadwell"-and Reuben took the cigar from his lips, threw it into the grate, and raised himself to a sitting posture-"Broadwell," he continued, "what would be the consequence, if you were to fail to meet this payment to-day?" 
                  "God only knows. I should be exposed first, and then-I must not think on what would follow. Rev. Dr. Broadwell, minister of one of the most aristocratic congregations, to be exposed as a gambler! It makes me shudder to think on't." 
                  "You are aware that I also am a gambler." 
                  "But a lucky one." 
                  "Grant it: but what of that?" Reuben said, a little more animated. "But what of that? Fortune, which until now has smiled upon me-tell me, Broadwell, may it not turn capricious, and in the future play me foul?" 
                  "I admit this, Armhold," replied Broadwell, feeling somewhat uneasy. "But what do you wish me to understand by this? I trust you do not mean to refuse me the loan?" 
                  "I simply mean to convey to you the idea that a time may arrive when I myself shall be in need of money. Gambling is uncertain. To-day we win: to-morrow we lose. Your intentions may be, and unquestionably are, very good, Broadwell; but as I stated before, if fortune should continue to frown upon you-mark me, be your intentions ever so good-why, you can not pay back the borrowed money; and I, for aught we know now, may just then, when you are the least prepared to satisfy my claim, be in need of it the most." 
                  "I think my luck must change, sooner or later," Broadwell argued, closing up his knife and playing with its handle. 
                  "So you have thought for months, and still luck is against you. It is supposed that fortune must sooner or later smile on one; but can you bide the time?" 
                  Broadwell turned somewhat paler. He felt himself undone. Rich as he had been, cards had beggared him. All the property he possessed he had been compelled to sell-even that which he had bought of Lionel Harrington. Reuben Armhold had become the purchaser of all. 
                  "Armhold," Broadwell commenced, after a short pause, "I wish to God you had never introduced me to your companions. Ever since I began to play with them, I have left the table loser." 
                  "The same might have happened to you playing with others." 
                  "It might, and it might not. This much I know: that if these fifteen hundred dollars are not paid by night, the morrow will see me ruined beyond recovery. Armhold, let me have the money; I shall pay you back, with a thousand thanks." 
                  "You know that you already owe me five thousand dollars." 
                  "You have my diamonds and other jewels as collateral; and if I had any thing else left me, I should cheerfully assign it to you." 
                  "You have your library. Give me a mortgage on your books, and I will advance you the money." 
                  "Armhold, you have me already in your power. It matters little now whether I mortgage my library or not. If you wish to ruin me, I know full well that you can do it at a moment's notice." 
                  He paused for a second before he proceeded. When he did commence again, it was with some restraint: 
                  "Will you pardon me, Armhold," he said, "if I inform you that, at times, despite your professions of friendship and your many favors, a doubt crosses my mind in regard to your sincerity, and whispers to my heart that you are my greatest enemy? Armhold, tell me, assure me, that my fears are unfounded." 
                  So saying, he rose from his chair and slowly walked across the room, then stopped in front of Reuben. 
                  "Tell me," said Broadwell, "are my fears unfounded?" 
                  "Why should they not be?" replied the other, a faint smile passing over his serene features. "Have I ever refused you a favor? When you were in the greatest need, who else but I came to your rescue? Was not my purse always at your command?" 
                  "It was; and yet-" He hesitated. 
                  "And yet what!" 
                  "I wish to heaven I had never made use of it!" Broadwell continued. "Before we became such intimate friends-and to this very day I can not account for this intimacy-I played cards, but never feared exposure; for all those with whom I gambled, with the exception of Lionel Harrington, had as much to fear from an exposure as I had, and therefore I could depend upon their secrecy. But you-I have no doubt it was done in kindness-have introduced me into another circle, and ever since the hour I joined it, something tells me that I have sold myself." 
                  "Fear nothing," replied Reuben. "You have to deal with men who study their interest too well to expose you. As regards myself, you are doing me injustice. When the news of my brother's death reached me, and you came to offer me your sympathy, I swore to remember you to the very last day of my life. And as there is a God in heaven, I have never thought of Edgar-of his life and of his death-but that oath recurred to me. Broadwell," after a short pause, "my brother was driven from home by a bitter enemy. Had it not been for that enemy, Edgar might be alive at this hour. Had it not been for that enemy, Reuben Armhold would not be the Reuben Armhold of today." 
                  He rose from his seat and paced the floor. He was not excited, though his breath seemed to come somewhat faster. 
                  "Will you not confide to me the name of that enemy?" asked Broadwell, his facial expression undergoing a sad change. 
                  "Not now. Have patience a short while, and you shall know his name." 
                  So saying, he approached his embarrassed friend, took hold of his hand, and said, while a faint smile rested in the curves of his lips: 
                  "You came for money, and you shall have it. I shall not disappoint you. You may call or send for it by noon." 
                  Now the conversation turned into a different channel, which, however, lasted but a few moments, when the reverend doctor left the house and made his way up Ninth. For his home? No; he would pay his addresses to Mrs. Hannah Armhold before he would go home. He had not seen her for a week; and business of importance, and a game he was playing, counseled him to leave off thinking, for the present, over his pecuniary embarrassment, and in its stead put on a false face, and pay the necessary morning call. A devil lurked in his bosom. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER III. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              And while in peace abiding 
                              Within a sheltered home, 
                              We feel as sin and evil 
                              Could never, never come; 
                              But let the strong temptation rise, 
                              As whirlwinds sweep the sea, 
                              We find no strength to 'scape the wreck, 
                              Save pitying God, in Thee! 
                           
                         
                        MRS. HALE'S ALICE RAY. 
                      
                   
                  IN attire, nothing became the Rev. Dr. Broadwell better than a plain suit of black. He knew it, and therefore scarcely ever wore any thing else. Even his white cambric neck-kerchief had been exchanged for a black silk tie. He had now more the appearance of a student and gentleman, than of a preacher, leaving-as a matter of course-a more favorable impression in proportion to his desire not to expose in public the least show of his unnecessary calling. On this particular morning he had taken unusual pains in dressing. He had selected his best-fitting coat, pants and vest, and even in the selection of his shirt, he showed more than ordinary attention. No one will believe, for a moment, that the visit he had intended to make, and since did make, to Mr. Reuben Armhold, had called for this extra care; the reader will rather think-and think corrcetly too-that something else had prompted him to it. 
                  We find him now seated in Mrs. Armhold's reception-room, Mrs. Armhold, herself, occupying a chair at a short distance from him. A handsome-or rather a very interesting couple-they appeared as they sat there: he, a man of twenty-nine years of age, well proportioned, full of unstudied grace, elegant ease, and a face bearing upon its classic and more than well-trained features, the marks of thought, study and refinement; and she, a woman of two and twenty, still impressed with the graceful outlines of girlhood, but now matured and ripened into that voluptuous rounding off that speaks of WOMAN and of womanhood. In the pose of her head, native pride and dignity, and in the expression of her eyes, calm brow, and features, experience, both of good and evil, of joy and sorrow, could be discerned. 
                  She was sewing; her small white fingers were deftly busy with arranging the cambric loosely lying on her lap. Broadwell drew his chair nearer, and took the privilege of examining the quality of the material. In so doing, his hand came slightly in contact with hers. She raised her head, and a crimson blush tinged her cheek. "Excuse me," she said, and moved her chair a little further away. Broadwell noticed it, but said nothing in return. After this a short pause ensued, which was, however, soon broken by Hannah, who, without raising her head from her work, commenced: 
                  "And is Mr. Reuben Armhold still embittered against me?" 
                  "He is, Mrs. Armhold," replied Broadwell, "and thinks you the cause of Edgar's death. I have done my best to convince him that the rumors that had been set afloat-as I said, by some malicious persons-in regard to Edgar's matrimonial infelicity, were without the least foundation, but he still persists in his opinion, which stubbornness satisfies me that he had come to Cincinnati as a spy from his brother, to watch your movements." 
                  "Let him think what he will. What need I fear?" 
                  "Nothing, indeed," replied Broadwell. "For has not Providence been more than kind to you? See what you are this day, and what you might have been! Mrs. HANNAH ARMHOLD is the widow of one of the first American authors-of a man who has left a high reputation and a princely fortune. She is admired for her beauty, respected for her virtues, and loved for her piety. Her name is among the first in the choicest of society, and her character is far above the assailants' reach. No one knows of her former domestic difficulties and unhappiness. Edgar Armhold and this secret lie buried in one grave. Tell me, Miss Hannah, was it not Providence that thus interfered in your affairs, and saved you from a disgrace which neither you nor I could have averted? Imagine but for a moment the result of your husband's departure, had he lived and remained away from you? Who could have staid the tongue of rumor? Could you? Could I? Could any one? No, his absence would have become a grave and a fertile subject for discussion, and your reputation-despite our efforts to save it-would have become a prey to our social buzzards. It was God himself who interfered in your behalf, and in order that you may live and repent for having married one who denied Jesus Christ, consigned Edgar to an early grave. Just imagine," he continued, with more animation, "just imagine, Miss Hannah, what a future would be yours had your husband not lost his life! Have you ever pondered over this? I scarcely think you have. For if you had you would not mourn, but a smile would continually rest upon those cheeks--" 
                  "Mr. Broadwell," and Hannah raised her head proudly erect, "remember that Mr. Armhold was my husband, and, although you have almost convinced me of his debased nature-I can still not hear him spoken of in this manner. It may be for the best that he died when he did; and, I have no doubt, that it was. Had he lived and not returned to me, I know I should not have had it in my power to satisfy the world's curiosity, and that my peace, happiness and reputation would have suffered incalculably. But all this is past, Mr. Broadwell, and now to recur to it again simply pains me. I hope you will excuse me for begging you to change the subject." So saying, she once more lowered her head and made the needle pass more deftly through her embroidery. "Have you seen my cousin-Miss Harrington-lately?" she added, after a short pause. 
                  "I saw her yesterday, Mrs. Armhold," replied Broadwell. "I met her on Fourthstreet, accompanied by Reuben, who seems to be enamored of her." 
                  Hannah received this information without evincing the least surprise. She only remarked that she had heard of Reuben's particular attention toward her cousin, and supposed that she should soon hear also of their betrothal. 
                  "Why do you suppose so?" Broadwell inquired, faintly smiling, and once more drawing his chair closer to that occupied by Hannah. "Why do you suppose so?" he continued, stopping over her work and playfully handling it. "Do you think that she loves him?" 
                  "How can I tell, Mr. Broadwell? We have not spoken to one another for years. She may love him and-" shrugging her shoulder-"and she may not. Rumor has it that she was as spiring to become the wife of Mr. Broadwell, whose intimacy with her brother, and whose frequent visits to Clifton give it a color of truth. Whether Mr. Armhold or Mr. Broadwell will have to be congratulated, is still a question time must decide." And Hannah stopped her work for a moment, and inquiringly gazed into the eyes of her visitor, who had raised himself up to return that gaze. 
                  "Never will Broadwell be the husband of Miss Carrie Harrington" he commenced, in a tone so rich and full, and seeming so free of all hypocrisy, that Hannah suffered her hands idly to fall on her lap, while she listened with profound attention to the young minister, whose company, though she would not confess it to herself, had of late, grown dearer and dearer to her-"No, never will Broadwell be the husband of Miss Carrie Harrington," he repeated, for the second time, "for he can never give his hand where he can not give his heart." 
                  Their eyes met, and a blush stole over Hannah's cheeks. "I thought you loved my cousin," she said, and looked down upon her sewing once more. 
                  "Did you really think so?" he inquired, drawing his chair still closer to hers. "Did you really think so?" 
                  "Certainly, I did." 
                  "Then you thought wrong." 
                  "Why? Is your love given so much to the spiritual that you can have no thought for the material?" 
                  "No, it is not that, Mrs. Armhold," he replied, his voice growing more and more earnest, "for he who loves his God must not of necessity hate the world. The minister of the church, like MAN in any other vocation, is more or less controlled by his passion; and I am nothing more than any other man. I can hate and do hate, though I know it to be a sin. I can love-love strongly, Mrs. Armhold, though I have schooled myself to conceal it from the world. I know my love will never be returned." As he said this, he straightened himself up, threw back his shoulders so as to expose his dilated breast, then placed his feet and form in a position which in their graceful attitude was calculated and intended to awaken in the bosom of Hannah, feelings through which he might in time win her as his own, or ruin her in case of his failure. 
                  Hannah was gazing at him-at that man who, for the first time in her presence, had assumed a new character, a character which represented him in the light of an impassioned youth-and a strange but pleasing thrill passed through her frame, and quickened her pulsation. She had heard him say "I know my love will never be returned," but she seemed to lack either the desire or courage to press him further to speak of this. Having waited a moment, as if she wanted the impression his conversation had left upon her mind, to wear away, and after once more busying herself with her work, she continued, assuming a liveliness, Broadwell was too well schooled not to notice as being ungenuine. "You are jesting, Mr. Broadwell," she said, once more meeting his impassioned gaze; "I don't think you care much for ladies' society." 
                  "O, don't think so, Miss Hannah," he replied, throwing a force into his mellowed voice, which was as far from being natural as his intentions were from being pure. "O, don't think so, Miss Hannah. Believe me, I can admire a woman as much as any man, and can love her-" Here he broke off, rose hastily from his chair, and proudly raised his head aloft, and, with cheeks flushed and eyes sparkling, advanced to where she sat, placed his small white hand upon his breast, and after a moment's pause, as if to give his opening words time to leave an impression upon her, in a voice still more rich and mellowed, continued: "Yes, and can love her," he repeated; "love her. Miss Hannah-O, how much I could love her!" 
                  And with this exclamation ended, he pressed his lips together, as if they were tasting a luscious joy, and then, dropping his arm from the position he had held it in, began, full of grace and dignity, to pace the floor. 
                  Hannah, her hands now idly folded in her lap, watched the movement of that figure as it passed in front of her, and a strange feeling, which brought a blush to her translucently pure cheeks, rose within her bosom, against the rising of which she did not attempt to struggle. 
                  "Were I capable of experiencing so strong a passion," she hazarded at last, once more looking down upon her work, "I should at once make up my mind to marry." 
                  "To marry!" And he halted before her. "To marry, did you say, Miss Hannah? O, how my heart yearns to pour forth its hidden wealth of love, if it only dared! But it must not; the fire must be quenched before it masters me and makes me forget myself. I have no hopes of ever having my love returned." 
                  He paused a moment, as if waiting for a reply; but finding that Hannah remained silent, he added: 
                  "Well, well, let us turn the conversation from this, to me, painful subject, into a more agreeable channel. By-the-by, I have not yet seen your Byron. May I be so bold as to take it from your book-case?-Thank you;" and he advanced to the other side of the room, and helped himself to a beautiful volume of Byron, elegantly bound in morocco and gilt-edged. "It is handsome, indeed," he exclaimed, in a show of admiration; and returning to his seat, close by that of Hannah, he laid it on his knees, and slowly turned its pages, carefully examining the various fine steel engravings. 
                  "I thought you did not like Byron?" remarked Hannah, raising her eyes from her work and looking at Mr. Broadwell, whose head was artfully lowered over a fine plate, which represented Medora waiting, watching for her Conrad. 
                  "Nor do I," he replied. "And yet I sometimes think I wrong that man, whose heart was all love, whose mind was all poetry, whose life all bitterness, whose pen seemed dipped in a fountain of tears, and whose pages whisper of sadness-sadness-sadness." 
                  Here he paused for a moment, and, instinctively feeling that Hannah was looking down over him, he suffered his voice to assume a little more volume, as he continued, moving his chair still closer to hers: 
                  "Is not this a fine engraving? Both the author and the artist must have felt the force of love-the former to conceive such an idea, and the latter to give it a shape. See how her gaze, full of thought and sadness, pierces the realm of space lying between the dark, deep blue water, and the still deeper blue arch of heaven! What a beautiful conception!" and he turned the book partly, so as to give Hannah also an opportunity to behold it. "I love to see nice engravings," he continued, turning the leaf, and at the same time placing himself in such a position that his knees slightly touched those of Hannah. No sooner had the movement been made than a blush stole over her cheeks, and she moved back a little. Broadwell feigned not to have been aware of either his or her movement, but continued to turn leaf after leaf, commenting now on this, and now on that, while Hannah, with her work idly folded in her lap, and one of her hands assisting in turning the pages, looked down upon the book, appearing to take unusual interest in its examination. 
                  As remarked, they sat almost opposite to each other. Now Broadwell gradually and unobservedly turned his chair, and himself in his chair, so as to be almost by the side of his companion. Eventually their hands came in contact, then for a moment, at times, would rest upon one another, until at last, by movements and stops, and movements again, Broadwell held, but without the slightest pressure, and as if with an unconsciousness of the act, Hannah's soft hand within his own. He had gained the first step, and his heart laughed within his bosom. 
                  If he did seem unconscious of the act, the lady by his side, the lady wearing sable, did not evince any sign of having any more knowledge of it than he. Still they turned the pages, and still they admired the engravings, but their voices had almost fallen to a whisper, and by this time Broadwell's form was touching hers. 
                  "This is Don Juan," he lisped, as both were looking down upon an engraving representing Byron's youthful hero with Haidee 
                      
                        EDGAR CARRIE AND LIONEL AT THE HOTEL. 
                     
                     
                      on his lap. "How sweet!" he whispered, and ventured to give a soft pressure to Hannah's hand. She did not return that pressure, but neither did she withdraw her hand. Ten minutes passed, and still they sat there, their cheeks almost touching, mutely gazing on that picture. "How sweet!" he whispered, scarcely audible; then, gently turning his face, he rather breathed than pressed a soft kiss upon her cheek. 
                  With the lightning's speed, the fire flashed from her eyes and the blood to her cheeks. "Sir!" she shrieked, full of anger, darting from her seat and dropping the book upon the floor, "this is insolence!" and she hurried like an angry goddess, whose pride had been wounded too much to keep itself in restraint, across the room. 
                  He expected as much. This genuine outburst of virtuous indignation did not take him by surprise. When, on the previous night, while lying awake on his soft couch, he had planned this scene which we have just witnessed, he had also made up his mind to play out this game fearlessly, but no less cautiously, to its very end. 
                  Hannah was still pacing up and down the room, her angry eyes now and then flashing down on him. Their glance he met coolly, for a moment; then he rose, raised himself up until he looked a head taller than he was, and said, as he approached and stopped her in her march: 
                  "Forgive me, Hannah! I have sinned against you! Curse me-curse me! What right have I to love and worship you?" 
                  So saying, he gracefully stepped across the room and made his way into the street. Going a little distance up Freeman, a sinister glance shot from his eyes, and a faint, malicious smile curved his thin lips, as they whispered: 
                  "The ice is broken-the ice is broken!" then his facial expression underwent another change, and a strange beauty paled in his calm features. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              I said to Penury's meagre train, 
                              Come on-your threats I brave; 
                              My last poor life drop you may drain, 
                              And crush me to the grave; 
                              Yet still, the spirit that endures, 
                              Shall mock your force the while, 
                              And meet each cold, cold grasp of yours, 
                              With bitter smile. 
                           
                         
                        MRS. STODDARD. 
                      
                   
                  THE ice was broken. Notwithstanding the outburst of unfeigned anger with which Hannah had greeted the first exhibition of her Reverend suitor's no less bold than impertinent conduct to which he had resorted in order to enamor her with his form and to fascinate her with his power of speech, her vanity-the vanity of a woman-soon persuaded her to believe that the extreme fervor of his love had simply overreached the bounds of discretion, and had made him-as is frequently the case under such circumstances-forget, for a moment, the necessary decorum and coolness society enjoins upon a gentleman of good breeding to observe in the presence of a lady. This idea had taken strong hold upon her mind, and the feeling of indignation which his conduct had called forth, subsided ere he had had time, in fact, to reach the street. In all probability, Hannah, if she had been twice her age, or had not looked with favor upon Broadwell's flattering attention which he had betsowed, both before and after she had become a widow, would, unquestionably, have looked upon his conduct as the grossest insult that could have been offered to her by any living gentleman. But the case had been a different one; and the reader, who is inclined to look upon it with an eye of experience and of observation, will not be astonished to hear that, since it could not raise her anger, it had given her a peculiar pleasure to have found herself, as she had for some time past fancied herself to be, the object of the admiration of the universally-admired and esteemed preacher-the Reverend Doctor Broadwell. A woman of two and twenty is-a woman of two and twenty, and though she was a widow, and her husband had scarcely found his untimely death five months previous, she was still a woman, and that-a woman of two and twenty. More need not be said. In her mind she had forgiven him. More, as time sped on, she eventually suffered him, and that before her year of mourning had seen her doff her sable robes, to press his suit with an earnestness that soon gave society just cause to look upon Mrs. Hannah Armhold as the choice of the Reverend Doctor Broadwell, whose wife she eventually consented to become, and at last did become, just one year and a half after the destruction and sinking of the Destiny, in which fated steamer her husband had embarked. 
                  It is now over five years since she had celebrated her second marriage day, and many strange things have passed with our characters in this intermediate time. Mr. and Mrs. Preston had died, Newton had left the city and settled in New York, and Hannah had no other relatives left her but the Harringtons, with whom she still was on bad terms. We find her now no more on Freeman-street, but in a small red brick dwelling on Seventh-street. 
                  It is a cold December evening, and a poor fire is throwing out its heat from the hearth in her sitting-room. The gas had been lit-not by Jane as in former days-but by herself, for Jane had been dismissed from her service, as Mr. Broadwell had once intimated to his wife that he could not see the necessity of keeping a servant when the expenses of sustaining his family was large enough without out one. Hannah was now seated in that room, her arms folded across her breast, and her eyes meaninglessly staring into the flames. There was no longer any beauty discernible on her face. She had grown much thinner and her complexion had turned sallow. She was now mother of five children, and those five children were now playing around her and keeping up a noise that, though enough to make a deaf man mad, did not in the least disturb her in her meditation. She kept on looking into the flames until footsteps, heard on the stairs, occasioned her to turn her head toward the door, which soon after opened to admit Mr. Broadwell. He, too, had aged considerably. Not only that some few wrinkles had plowed his cheeks, but some few white hairs were now falling over his bald-growing temples. He still wore black, but his suit was threadbare and seedy, and scarcely of the description one by choice would wear in the winter season. He had felt, evidently, the effects of the cold, for he at once crossed over to the fireplace and sat himself down before it. Hannah watched him for a moment, then ordered the children into the kitchen. She had taught them to obey her, and young as they were, they had learned to mind her. Consequently, Emil, now over eight years of age, took his four step-brothers and sisters into the kitchen, leaving his mother alone with his step-father who had never smiled upon him as he did upon the other children, but had always treated him with a severity from which he always shrunk-the poor, timid boy-like a wounded deer. 
                  "Broadwell," commenced Hannah, being now alone with her husband, "where have you been again since yesterday." 
                  "I had some business to attend to down town," was the reply. He neither turned his face nor raised his head as he spoke. 
                  Hannah watched him for a moment, and without taking her eyes from him, or changing the sad expression of her partially sunken cheeks, she said, after a pause in a sepulchral tone: 
                  "You lie, Broadwell." 
                  After a second, in a voice equally as subdued, but with an assumed show of indifference: 
                  "Well, then, I lie." 
                  "Then you will not tell me where you have been?" 
                  "I have told you already. I had some business to attend to down town." 
                  "What sort of business?" 
                  "Does it matter to you what sort of business I had to attend to?" 
                  "It does: and I want to know it." 
                  "Then find it out." And he took the poker in the hand and began to stir up the fire. Hannah still had her eyes on him. She had listened to him calmly as she had intended to do, and was still determined to keep cool and suppress the ill-feelings that were tumultuously rising in her breast Without changing the tone of her voice which had been calm and dispassionate, she leaned her chin against her hand, and said: 
                  "There was a time when you would have blushed to give so rude and curt an answer to your wife." 
                  "That was before she tried my patience as much as she does now." 
                  A blush of anger stole over Hannah's face, and her eyes began to glisten as of old. A moment later and the red tinge had subsided from her cheeks, and a wave of sadness and utter helplessness had passed over them instead. But still there was something determined in their look, and her lips were firmly set. 
                  "How do I try your patience now, Broadwell?" she said. 
                  "O, change this subject," was his reply, giving signs of irritation. "If you keep on provoking me as usual, I shall instantly leave the house again." 
                  "Broadwell!" She paused for a minute or two so as to arrange her thoughts properly ere she would express them. "Broadwell! you have not been home for twice twenty-four hours. It is the mother of your four children who speaks to you now. I am the wife of your choice and the partner of your present disgrace-nay, start not, Broadwell, for I am determined that you shall hear me to-night. You promised to be home yesterday, at noon, and bring me money so that I could buy our little ones something to eat. You did not come home, Broadwell; you did not bring me any money." Here she changed her voice, and there was a threatening in her hollow accents: "Have you brought me any money now? The children must have something to eat; I have sold every thing that I thought would sell, and Emil must have warmer clothes, unless you want the frail boy to die." 
                  "Damn Emil-" 
                  Hannah heard the expression and the blood rushed to her cheeks. For a moment she seemed transfixed to her chair. Her lips began to tremble and the hasty rising and falling of her bosom were but faint signs of her inward agitation. When she began to speak, she was once more composed, and from her sunken, sallow cheeks the crimson had departed. 
                  "What has my little Emil done that you should curse him?" 
                  "Enough. He is Edgar's child, and I hate the boy for his father's sake." 
                  "Edgar was an angel, and so is his boy. Would to God that I had never seen you, so I might this night enjoy my Edgar's blessing." 
                  "I wish you never had." 
                  Again the blood rose to Hannah's cheeks. 
                  "You dastardly knave," she commenced, no longer able to control her feelings. "You have a right to say so. You! Have you forgotten gotten that I am the daughter of Mr. Preston of Avondale, and the widow of Edgar Armhold? Have you forgotten that I am connected with the first families in the State? That I have still a brother alive, who can and will protect me from your insults? What have I done that you should treat me thus? Have I not given you all I had? Where is my gold? Where are my jewels? Where the thousands Edgar left to me? Where is my all?" A pause, and she rose from her seat, and advanced to where he sat, sulkily looking into the flames. "You need not answer me. At the gaming table you have spent my fortune, and robbed your wife and children of their daily bread. I do not upbraid you now. I have taught myself to bear my cross in meekness. It is for my children-for your children, Broadwell-that I speak. God! were I not a mother-" and she gnashed her teeth in suppressed anger-"yes, were I not a mother; were I not laboring to save my little innocent children from future shame, Broadwell, you should not treat me as you do. But my poor little innocents, they are the ones to suffer by exposing you and bringing you to justice. Not I, no, no, not I." 
                  "Have you done?" 
                  "Done? Done, did you say? Done? No, Broadwell, I have not done! I have scarcely commenced. Before I shall have done with you, I must have had a hearing. Do you understand me? A hearing!" 
                  "Well, what have you to say?" And Broadwell slowly drew the poker from out the grate in which the embers had died out, and placed it by the mantel. 
                  "Will you listen?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  Hannah moved her chair closer to his, sat down, and, after wetting her parched lips with the tip-end of her tongue, commenced: 
                  "You have lost all I possessed." 
                  "I thought you did not intend to call up bygones." 
                  "Nor do I, Broadwell. I have told you what's past is past-that I have learned to bear my fate. I simply wish to speak to you of the present and the future." 
                  "Well, go on." 
                  "You have resigned your position as minister; you have no longer any regular income. Poverty stares my children in the face; I have nothing more to give them; the bread you bought for them three days ago is gone. You promised to supply me with money yesterday; you failed to do it. I went and sold my shawl, and we have lived on the money since then. I know not how to feed the hungry mouths of my innocent children in the future. You are their father; I look to you for their support Broadwell, you see I am cool. I am as dispassionate as if I had no deep griefs to ruffle my spirit. Will you promise me to reform?" 
                  "Do you wish to give me a lecture?" Broadwell growled, angrily looking at the woman whose great love for her children restrained her pride, and kept her from coining words which might give offense. 
                  "Mr. Broadwell, I do not wish to give you a lecture, but I thought it would be best for us to have a definite understanding now. I will not ask you where you have been since yester-morn. Let that pass-yes, let that pass. Will you promise me to reform?" 
                  "What do you mean by 'reform?' Do you mean that I should quit the gamingtable now, after I have lost all and have nothing more to risk? Let me tell you, woman, if this is the purport of your words, I must assure you that you are spending idle breath, for I am determined to pursue my course until I shall feel like changing it." 
                  "Broadwell, Broadwell, do not drive me mad! It is the mother of your children who speaks to you now. She asks nothing for herself; she only wants bread for her children. She pleads to your manhood, to your love, in their behalf. Promise me to reform." 
                  "And is this all you have to say?" 
                  "No, Broadwell, it is not all. I have much more to tell you." 
                  "Well, continue." 
                  "Not until you have promised me to change your course of life." 
                  "But if I were inclined not to promise it: what then?" 
                  "And are you thus inclined?" Still in the same calm, deliberate tone. 
                  "Well, yes." 
                  "Then hear me, Broadwell!" and she rose from her chair, and once more her native pride flashed from her eyes, and lighted up her wan cheeks: "I shall desert you! I am willing to toil for my children's support as long as God gives me strength. You shall never more see them nor me, for I shall leave the city, and seek my bread among strangers. Until now I have concealed my poverty from the world, for I wanted to spare my little innocents the bitterness of exposing their worthless father. I have endured all a woman can endure. You have plunged me from the hight of honor and affluence into the lowest pit of degradation and penury. Yet I have never raised a complaint in public. I looked upon my laughing brats, and it closed my lips. But now you drive me to extremes. You know the children must have bread, and still you make no efforts to obtain it for them. Do you want them to starve?" 
                  "Will you listen to me now?" 
                  Hannah remained quiet, and he continued: 
                  "You have just threatened to leave me, haven't you? Yes. Well, why did you make this threat? Would you really carry it out, if I were disposed to insist upon my authority? Or do you simply want to frighten me, as you did Armhold once?" Seeing that Hannah kept silent, he continued, without noticing the bitterness of her expression, and the fixed determination that straightened out her thin, white lips: "If you wish to leave, I shall be the last man to hinder you from going. Now let me see whether you have the courage to execute your threat. Go; I am tired of you any how!" 
                  Hannah did not heed the last part of her husband's remark. She had long since learned to bear such, and even greater insults. She gulped it down as she had done the rest. But she had an answer to his other remark-his willingness for her to leave him. 
                  "Broadwell," she said, coming still closer to him, but without changing her tone or the severe look of her face, "let me once more appeal to you for our children's sake. Say, tell me-tell me," and now she burst out in tears, "do you want to drive me mad? Say, do you? Why will you disgrace your children? Why will you blight their prospects-the prospects of my poor, poor children? O, Broadwell, Broadwell! here upon my knees," and she fell upon her knees before him, "I appeal to you to reform; and I shall forget the past, and love you, and work for you-" 
                  Just then a pale, consumptive looking boy, poorly clad and half-frozen, entered the room. It was Emil Armhold, Hannah's eldest. No sooner had Broadwell observed the emaciated boy than a sinister expression shot from his eyes, as he asked, "What do you want, you sneak?" 
                  "I only wanted to see what keeps mother so long," he said, frightened at the welcome he received. 
                  "You have been listening! Haven't you, you little puppy?" and he rose from his chair and pulled the boy's ear. 
                  Hannah saw it, turned pale as ashes, and shivered as if a piece of ice had dropped upon her heart. The mother was awake in her. She darted forward and tore her sickly boy away from the merciless wretch, and hurried with him into the kitchen. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER V. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              HER lively looks a sprightly mind disclose, 
                              Quick as her eyes, and as unfixed as those; 
                              Favors to none, to all she smiles extends- 
                              Oft she rejects, but never once offends, 
                              Bright as the sun her eyes the gazers strike, 
                              And, like the sun, they shine on all alike. 
                           
                         
                        POPE'S RAPE OF THE LOCK. 
                      
                   
                  ON this same cold, December evening Reuben Armhold, who still lodged at the Montgomerys, came down into the drawing-room, in order to enjoy the company of Miss Nellie. She was reading a book when he entered. 
                  "Don't be disturbed on my account," be said, as he beheld her lay the book aside. "I shall stay but a few minutes, inquire how you feel in this extremely cold weather, and then be off. Is it cold enough for you now?" and he moved across the room and took a seat by her side on the sofa. 
                  "Cold enough!" she exclaimed, half laughing, and showing her pretty white teeth. "No, indeed, not for me. Why, do I look as if I could not stand colder weather?" and she turned her face toward his, and exhibited a pair of rosy cheeks-not painted ones-and a pair of lips to match them in healthful hue, to assure any one of the hardiness of her constitution. "Look at me good; do I appear as if I would freeze, or would wither in the first cool breeze?" And she laughed heartily, as she rose from her seat to remove a piece of ember that had fallen from the fender upon the rug. 
                  Reuben watched her-watched her closely as she moved across the room, and his eyes brightened as some thought passed through his mind. The bright-eyed, laughing, mischievous-looking girl of sixteen had grown into a fully-developed, voluptuous-shaped woman of one-and-twenty; and her charms, as they had gradually developed during Reuben's residence at her house, had not been passed by unnoticed by him. Far from it. For years he had taken a peculiar delight in listening to her voice, in looking at her eyes, in watching every movement of her form; and though he had never told her, and in fact he had not known it himself, how entirely he had become her slave, she had been by no means slower than the rest of her sex in discovering the conquest she had made. And as Reuben was a handsome man, she had felt flattered by his attentions, and had given him now and then such meaningful glances, which are scarcely sufficient to compromise a woman's honor, but more than enough to unsettle a man's honest intentions, and awaken in him thoughts that will, if not opening for him the gates of Elysium, lead him straight as an arrow to perdition. 
                  In saying that he liked her, the true state of his feelings is no more definitely and accurately expressed than in saying that he loved her. Reuben was simply enamored of her; knew her bad no less than her good qualities, and would willingly have borne with the former if he could have always enjoyed the latter. He was charmed by her figure, and the very sight of her at any time was sufficient to heat his blood, make his pulse beat faster, and give his eyes a strange luster. 
                  After removing the smoking ember, Nellie retraced her steps and once more sat down by the side of Reuben. For a short pause both eyed one another without uttering a single word. They did not shrink at this close scrutiny, but seemed to understand the thoughts just passing through each other's minds. At last Reuben heaved a long sigh, or rather took a long breath; but still Nellie's soft eyes were not drawn from his. Why she looked at him so long and so steadily we can only attribute to the desire of the frailer sex to feed their vanity by exercising their power of fascination over one and all alike, be it proper or not-attendant of good or evil. 
                  Reuben's chest dilated and his eyes grew brighter. Again he took a long breath, and this time he was bold enough to draw a little nearer to the pretty, blushing woman by his side. She kept her seat-budged not an inch. Whether she accurately knew what was just then passing through his mind we know not; we only know that she still gazed into his eyes, and that her sweet breath could be felt by his cheeks. Reuben raised himself up, and was about to make another move in Nellie's direction, when she sprung to her feet, and, laughing with her whole heart and soul, crossed over to the opposite side of the room, and seating herself before the piano, began to sing one of those impassioned lays with which the daughters of Normandy subdued the hearts of the troubadours. 
                  Reuben's cheeks turned ashy white; his eyes grew brighter and his lips began to quiver. She was still singing, her voice now rising to the highest key, now falling to the softest whisper. 
                  "Nellie!-" 
                  She stopped at once, and turned her face in the direction from whence her name was called. It was Reuben who had called her. 
                  "What do you want, Mr. Armhold?" 
                  "I want you to sit down here for a moment;" and he pointed to the seat she had occupied by his side a few minutes before. 
                  "Why do you want me to sit down there?" 
                  "Won't you come and sit down here?" his tongue pleaded not half so coaxingly as his eyes. 
                  "Why, can't you tell me here all you have to tell me?" 
                  "No, I can't." 
                  "You can't?" and she laughed right out. "Try once, Mr. Armhold." 
                  "Nellie, come and sit down here." 
                  This scarcely above a whisper. Their eyes met once more, and this time a blush rose to Nellie's cheeks, and her heart began to beat a little faster. 
                  "Must I plead so often before you will oblige me, Nellie? Say, must I?" 
                  She rose from her seat and left the piano. As he saw her approach, in all her native grace and beauty, his eyes sparkled with an inward joy, and his blood ran faster through his veins. She sat down by his side. Never before had she looked so irresistibly charming, he thought, than now as she coyly lowered her head over her gently heaving bosom. He tremblingly took hold of her hand and fondly stroked it. She did not resist; she suffered him to dally with her hand, which he at last, no longer able to restrain himself, firmly held between his own, and would have passed to his lips, had not her face, which she now for the first time raised to his, warned him from doing so. 
                  "Let me get up, Mr. Armhold." 
                  "Nellie-" 
                  "Let me get up, please." 
                  "O, Nellie!" 
                  "Mr. Armhold, please release my hand." 
                  "Won't you listen to me?" 
                  "Yes, if you will release my hand." 
                  He released her hand, and, as she did so, she sprung to her feet, laughed one of those bewitching laughs which are capable of undoing the strongest man, and danced out of the room. Reuben watched her depart, and, as the shadow of her form had disappeared behind the door, a dark frown-the frown we have so often seen upon his brow-took up its habitual abode upon his face, and extinguished the light that had shone in his eyes. Once more he drew a long breath, but this time he compressed his lips, and a wrinkle, in the shape of a cross, made its appearance over his eyebrows. Whether it was the hope of her returning once more, or that this unlooked-for proceeding for a moment suspended his judgment and kept him for something like fifteen minutes right in the same position in which he had been left by Nellie, it was not, at all events, until sufficient time had elapsed to assure him that she would not be likely to make her appearance again, at least as long as he occupied the drawing-room, that he rose from his seat, picked up his hat, and left the house. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              WHAT miracle 
                              Can work me into hope! Heav'n here is bankrupt- 
                              The wond'ring gods blush at the want of power, 
                              And quite abash'd confess they can not help me. 
                           
                         
                        LEE'S MITHRIDATES. 
                      
                   
                  ARRIVED in the kitchen, Hannah sat down by the window. Little Emil was by her side, his pale, sad face raised to his mother's. Some of the smaller children were crying: she did not hear them, at least she did not move, but continued to look out into the dark street below. 
                  "Some bread, 'ma." 
                  The sound came from the opposite side of the kitchen. It pierced the mother's heart. It was her own child who had cried for bread, and for the first time in her life she could not still its hungry little mouth. There was no light in the room, but the reflection from the dying embers in the stove just threw a pale shadow in the direction where the children were huddled up on the floor, and made them look more ghastly as she gazed upon them. A cold chill passed through her frame; then she rose and lighted a candle, and, while still holding it in her hand, kept looking down upon her innocently suffering babes. The smallest lifted its tiny hands toward her, but she did not take it up She simply looked at it as with a face of stone, without moving an inch from her position. Soon another and another of the children began to cry lustily, and amid their cries the words "bread" and "hunger" fell distinctly upon the mother's ear. Still she moved not; still her glassy eyes rested upon her suffering ones. A heavy sigh escaped her thin blue lips, and, as a cold shiver passed through her frame, her pallid face turned greenish-but only for a moment-then the life-blood came back to her cheeks, and her eyes began to roll wildly in their sockets. 
                  "O, 'ma, give us something to eat," cried out a three-year old boy, and he walked toward his mother, and, while raising his large blue eyes to her sad face, pulled her dress. Just then Emil-pale as the shadow of the moon-neared his little brother, and begged him to let 'ma alone, as she would soon give them all their supper. The child would not be quieted; it continued to cry for bread. Hannah's heart almost broke, and strange thoughts flashed wildly through her mind. What would she do? Money she had none-knew not where to obtain any. There was nothing left for her to sell; every thing that could have brought money was long since disposed of. She was on the verge of despair. She could not bring herself to ask for alms. She still had some pride left. Was she not a Preston? And had she not been the wife of Edgar Armhold? Had it really come so far that she must look upon her own children while they starved? 
                  She placed the candle on the table, while she herself once more sat down. Long and earnestly did she look through the windowpanes. She watched the people as they passed up and down the street. She wondered whether among the hundreds upon whom her eyes fell there was another who suffered as she did-who had children and could not feed them. 
                  A shadow fell upon the window-pane in front of her. She collected her scattered thoughts and looked around. Now, for the first time, she discovered that her little ones, with the exception of Emil, had fallen asleep. He was seated on a little stool in the opposite corner. His eyes had not wandered away from his mother's face a moment. 
                  Hannah called on him in a whisper. The pale boy rose to go to his mother. There was no need to tell him to tread lightly; his step was as light as that of a fawn. By his mother's side, she pressed him to her bosom, and was about to print a kiss upon his cheeks, when lo! she discovered blood trickling down his ear. It was the effect of Broadwell's finger-nails. It was more than she could bear. The cup was full to the brim. A tear-a single tear-came into her eyes; but it was a weakness she was determined to suppress at once. She had been long enough weak; 'twas time that she should change her tactics. Her heart began to throb in her bosom. Her eyes began to glisten like those of the hyena. Once more she looked at the patient, uncomplaining little sufferer, kissed the blood away with her own lips; then, while a cold, cold shiver passed through her frame, left the kitchen. 
                  A moment later she stood in front of Broadwell, who was just in the act of leaving the room as she entered. She pushed him back with a force she scarcely deemed herself possessed of, and, without giving him time to recover from the surprise, took him by the neck to throttle him, saying: "Why have you struck my boy? Say, why?" 
                  She was furious, and her voice rung shrilly through the room. 
                  Broadwell had kept cool. The first move he made was to release himself; but finding the gripe she had on him somewhat firmer than he had expected, he simply held her hands from doing further mischief, while he said: 
                  "Take your hands off, or I'll hurt you. Do you hear me?" 
                  She heard, but she did not heed him; and as she gazed upon that cool face, full of wile and intrigue, she grew still more furious. 
                  "Say, why have you hit my boy?" and her hands, despite the resistance he offered, now closed tighter upon his neck. With one jerk he threw her off, and as she fell upon the floor a sinister laugh escaped his lips. One minute, and Hannah was once more upon her feet-was about to rush upon him, aye, and tear the demon to pieces, but before she had proceeded two steps she tottered, and would have fallen again upon the floor, had she not taken hold of the back of a chair in order to support herself. She was already exhausted, and, as she looked into his face and discovered a sinister smile upon it, she sank down upon the chair, hid her face in her apron, and sobbed aloud. 
                  Broadwell, as we are well aware, had not the weakness of entertaining or exhibiting sympathy for any one, and, least of all, for his wife. Hence it must not surprise the reader to find him now so little affected. He simply drew a cigar from his pocket, and lit it, then slowly puffed away, and with a philosophic eye watched the smoke-cloudlets pass over his head. 
                  It is a feeling natural to us all to be less provoked by receiving either deserved or undeserved punishment at the hands of a fellow-being, than if we rally our whole strength in order to inflict a heavy chastisement upon which our whole mind and soul is bent, and, just as we are in the act of executing it, find ourselves, either on account of our own weakness or some other cause, unable to accomplish our design. 
                  Hannah was, as she sat there frustrated in her attempt, somewhat under the influence of that feeling. It made her tears come faster as she meditated over her own wrongs and the defenseless position in which she was placed. When, after the lapse of some few minutes, Broadwell rose, slowly buttoned up his coat, and walked toward the door-it was then that her aroused anger knew no bounds. In a twinkling of an eye she was by his side, her hand upon his arm-sleeve. He looked around, and, as their eyes met, while not a muscle stirred in the face of either, they seemed to hold their breath. It was the lull before the battle's commencement. Broadwell did not move-nor did Hannah. They simply eyed one another unflinchingly. A little change in his facial expression bleached Hannah's cheeks still more, and made her hold upon his coat-sleeve tighter. 
                  A jerk-a determined jerk. Broadwell's arm was free, but part of his sleeve remained in Hannah's grasp. Anger flashed from his eyes; now his glances fell upon her plastic face, and now upon his torn arm-sleeve; and yet she moved not. There was a death-like stillness in the room-will it be broken by the voice of reason or passion? 
                  We believe that, had not a wicked smile at that moment made the already hideous face of Broadwell still more hideous, Hannah would have let her better nature control her, and once more would have called upon his manhood, upon his sacred vows of love, upon his duties as husband and father, to have pity on her and her children, and beg him upon her knees, and from the depth of her heart, with a voice scarcely resistible, once more to seek the path of virtue and honor. But that smile-that mocking, sinister smile, which spoke as plainly as a smile could speak of the devil lurking within-froze up her blood, and made her still more defiant. Throwing the torn arm-sleeve upon the floor, she said, in a husky voice, as she moved away: 
                  "Now go out, if you can!" 
                  His eyes followed her until she sat down by the window, then he riveted them upon her face until their glances met. 
                  A sharp pang shot through her heart; a strange chill crept through her frame. Would to heaven some one was with her in that room! Never before had she known fear, but now her very limbs trembled with fear. She felt as if something terrible would happen. 
                  She could no longer stand his glance; and yet it seemed to her that to remove her eyes, would be followed by the terrible storm she dreaded to encounter. 
                  He stepped across the room, and took up a position in front of her. She lowered her head, and as he observed it a grim smile struggled, but only for the twinkling of an eye, on his sharp, set features. 
                  "Look up here!" There was terror in that hoarse, grating voice. There was no need to repeat the demand; she obeyed. Her pale, sad face was raised to his. She wanted to cry and fall upon her knees, but fear kept her from it. 
                  "Do you see this?" and he pointed toward his torn arm-sleeve. 
                  Now his face turned ashen, and his lips began to look as if they had stiffened out in death. 
                  "O, let me sew it up for-" 
                  The balance of her remark died upon her lips, for Broadwell, no longer able to restrain himself, dealt her, with the open palm of his hand, a blow upon her cheek which brought at once the blood from mouth, nose, and ears. 
                  A shriek of pain vibrated through the air, and its sad echo was heard back in the kitchen, where all the children, with the exception of the sickly Emil, lay fast asleep on the floor. 
                  Five minutes later we find that boy stealing from the kitchen, just in time to see his father descend the stairs. He waited a few seconds, and then went into his mother's room and to his mother's side. 
                  She was lying on the floor, weeping bitterly. Her face was encircled by her arms, so that Emil could not see it. 
                  "What is the matter, 'ma?" pleaded the little boy, and he knelt by her side. She still continued to sob. 
                  "O, 'ma!" and he placed his head between his two thin, transparent hands, and also began to weep. 
                  The mother's heart was full. Hannah raised herself up, and pressed the boy to her heart. There was still some comfort left: her Edgar's child loved her. She did not care for the blood that trickled down her cheeks; she did not heed the pain that the swelling of her cheek occasioned; she only thought of her children and of their future. 
                  "What made you bleed, 'ma?" inquired the boy, half guessing the truth. "Did 'pa-" 
                  He hesitated. Hannah pressed him once more to her heart, and said: 
                  "No, my dear; I knocked my face against the mantel and hurt myself. 'Pa is too good to hurt mamma, though he is cross at times to you and me." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              If there be a crime 
                              Of deeper die than all the guilty train 
                              Of human vices, 'tis ingratitude. 
                           
                         
                        BROOKE'S EARL OF WARWICK. 
                      
                   
                  WHEN hunger gnaws upon the heart, a lengthy sleep, though brought about by physical as well as bodily exhaustion, is impossible. Hannah's children, who had lain fast asleep when little Emil had stolen away from them, now send up a loud chorus, reminding their mother at once that there was still a duty of hers unperformed. The little ones had to have something to eat. Those hungry mouths had to be fed. It matters little how the nourishment was to be obtained-obtained it had to be. The emergency was great, but she imagined herself equal to the task. Accordingly she rose from the floor, and, without looking into the mirror, washed away the blood from her face. She could feel that her cheek was swollen, but she didn't mind it. It was a trifling thing compared to the troubles of her mind. 
                  "Emil, let's go to the children." 
                  She took the boy by the hand and led him back into the kitchen. They did not speak to one another-their hearts were too full-and, if they had, their voices would have been drowned in the loud shrieks and cries coming from the little ones' throats. As she entered the kitchen a horrible sight presented itself to her eyes. One of the children lay upon the floor apparently dead: it had fainted, the poor thing. The rest had red noses and blue lips. The fire had gone out for the want of a new supply of fuel; and the children shivered from the effects of the cold. No sooner did they see their mother than their cries grew still louder, and they lifted their tiny arms in a supplicating attitude toward her. But her eyes were away from them. She was looking-scarcely for a second-upon her half-dead child, then, with the speed of the lightning's flash, while an unearthly shriek escaped her lips, she threw herself upon the floor, tore open the waist of her dress, and, pressing the cold, stiff child to her naked bosom, tried to warm it once more to life. 
                  She rocked herself to and fro in almost unendurable agony. Her eyes were streaming over with tears as they bent down upon the little, lifeless thing in her arms. The cries of her other children, growing louder and louder, were unheeded, for she was almost beside herself. 
                  The babe would not be warmed back to life, and yet she pressed it to her bosom, now and then a hope-just for a moment-entering her soul that it was still breathing. At last it did breathe, and open its eyes. A wild shriek of happiness escaped the poor mother's heart, and a brightness-the sunshine of the soul-passed over her face, and beautified with the beauty of heaven each single feature. 
                  The child was alive and lay smiling on her bosom! The wealth of Croesus could not have purchased back from her the happiness each single breath of its little mouth wafted upon her face. 
                  She fed it with her own milk, and, as she did so, something heavenly wove itself into the sadness of her eyes, cheeks, and lips, and she beckoned the rest of her little ones to come to her side. They came and nestled down by her, and, as her maternal gaze fell upon these little angels, her heart expanded and she felt herself growing strong. And now, she stroked their soft, flowing hair, and spoke sweet words to them. They should have supper, she told them, and a good warm room to sleep in, and many nice toys, little horses, and little dogs, and little cats, and-O, so many other nice things they should have. 
                  The children listened profoundly, scarcely removing their wide-opened eyes from their mother's face. "Now, let us go into my room," she said coaxingly, as she raised herself from the floor, and beckoned the rest to follow her. Little Emil, who had been silent ever since he had entered the kitchen with his mother, now began to talk to the children and helped them along. They soon reached the other room, when they once more began to cry for bread. Hannah silenced them with promises, and after she had laid the baby into her own bed and covered it up warmly, threw a thin shawl over her shoulders and said to Emil: 
                  "I am going away for a moment, darling, to get some supper for you. Will you be good, and watch the children till I come back?" 
                  The pale boy said a faint "Yes." Hannah stooped and pressed a fond kiss upon his thin cheeks. "Be good," she whispered once more, then left the room-but not until she had once more smiled upon her children and promised them their supper-with tears in her eyes. 
                  Her mind was made up: she would go to Jane, her former servant, to whom she had always been kind, and who would most certainly help her with a small loan. For Jane had married, and her husband was a well-to-do mechanic. Why did she not go to her sooner, and get help? Hannah asked herself, as she now took a westerly course. Jane surely would have given her any thing in her power to give. Would have been happy to serve her old mistress, who had been so good to her. 
                  Filled with these and the like ideas, and deeply impressed with the folly she had committed in having struggled against receiving all kinds of assistance-even from her own Jane-she hurried along Central avenue until she found herself but a short distance from the Hamilton road. She was now in the direct neighborhood in which Jane resided. Few minutes and she would be at the end of her journey. She could already see the little red brick in which her former servant lived. Now, for the first time since she left her home, did Hannah slacken her pace and become thoughtful. How to broach the subject had not yet entered her mind; what to say. What reason to assign for a visit at such an unusual hour. Should she tell the truth, the whole truth? Could she tell it? No, no! not on account of a thousand reasons. She could not humble herself so far. Though poor, though starving-she was still a Preston. And though she hated and despised the man she had to call "husband," that man was still the father of her children, and for the sake of those innocent children, she would spare him from exposure. 
                  By this time she had gained the end of her journey; she was standing before the house-door. It would not do to remain in that position any length of time, even if the weather had been more favorable than it was, and help far less urgent. People who were passing to and fro would notice her, and draw their attention upon her. She had to make up her mind at once, and she did make it up at once. 
                  She knocked at the door, for there was no bell, and a minute afterward Jane herself, full of unexpected joy, and with a babe lustily crying on her arm, admitted her former mistress. The joy was almost unbounded. Jane knew scarcely what to say first or do foremost. Hannah had to take a seat at once by the fire; to tell how Mr. Broadwell was; how all the children were; whether they were growing fast, and whether little Emil still thought of her. All these, and a thousand other equally unimportant questions, were asked and answered before Hannah thought the proper moment had arrived to make her business known. At length Jane, however, asked, as she seated herself by her former mistress: 
                  "And what in the world could have brought you out here so late in the night? I would no more have dreamed of your coming than I would have expected to see an angel from heaven. But I am nevertheless happy to see you. Ain't it something like six months since I was down town? Yes, it must be that many months, if not more; and I have not seen you since. And you say the children are all well? No?" and she gave Hannah a chance to put in a few words. 
                  "No," she said, "the poor things have bad colds, and cough at times so fearfully that I begin to feel right uneasy about them." 
                  "Poor little things! And what do you do for them, Mrs. Broadwell? Do you give them any cough-sirup? Cough-sirup is so very good for the children. And do you dress them warm?" All this in a truly sympathetic tone. 
                  "You ask me whether I dress them warm,' Hannah replied at once, "as if you did not know how careful I am in this particular! Why, I was just out to buy some flannel for them; Mr. Broadwell gave me five dollars to get clothes for the children; and would you believe it, Jane," and here a faint smile passed over Hannah's face-"yes, would you believe it, Jane, when I came to pay for what I had bought-it amounted to just five dollars and fifty cents-I discovered that the pocket of my dress had been picked!" 
                  "Now ain't that provoking? And you haven't the least idea upon whom to lay suspicion?" 
                  "Not the least, Jane. All I know is that the money is gone. Can you divine, now, why I have come to see you at so late an hour?" 
                  A suspicion involuntarily raised itself in Jane's mind. Hannah wanted to borrow money; she had come for that purpose, and for no other. 
                  "Indeed, I can not, Mrs.Broadwell." 
                  There was something in the intonation of these words that threw a chill into Hannah's heart. She raised her eyes to the face of her former servant in order to satisfy herself whether her surmises were correct. But Jane was looking down upon her own child, being at the same time busy in arranging and straightening out its little white apron. 
                  "I came to borrow some few dollars of you, Jane-" 
                  She was not yet quite through; but seeing that the other wanted to say something, she held in until the other had remarked: 
                  "I am so sorry that I can't let you have any. You may believe me, I haven't a cent in the house. Won't he let you have the goods without the money? I am sure you would pay him?" 
                  Mrs. Broadwell opened her eyes wide. Was that Jane-her own Jane, the woman she had so often befriended-who had spoken to her? Was that the woman on whose account she had upbraided herself for not having asked far sooner for assistance? Was it possible that a person could change so much? It was. The proof was right before her eyes. Jane was afraid to loan her five dollars, for fear of not getting them back! She had evidently been informed of Mr. Broadwell's career, and now-having no longer the least interest in any one outside her own household, comprising husband and children-thought herself justified in closing her heart to all foreign appeals. What was Hannah to her now? Nothing. With the marriage-vow a woman expels-and at times, without her knowing-each and every image that may perchance have found a resting place within-and all her love in concentrated force falls upon her husband and her offspring. Notwithstanding all protestations, father, mother, brother and sister lose all interest in her eyes, and nothing lives for her but husband and children. And Jane was as the rest of her sex. 
                  Hannah eyed her for a moment, then the pride of the Prestons came to her rescue. Sooner would she have died, aye, and seen her children die too, than to have humiliated herself still more before this ungrateful woman, who had once lived upon her generosity. 
                  She rose from her seat, straightened herself up as much as she could, then stepped across the small room. And as she neared and then passed through the door, Jane hadn't the moral courage to lift her face or say good night. 
                  Thus ended the interview. 
                  Poor, poor Hannah!

                              Down-cast, and low, in meek submission drest, 
                              But full of guile. Let not the serpent tongue, 
                              Prompt to deceive, with adulation smooth, 
                              Gain on your purposed will. Nor in the bower, 
                              Where woodbines flaunt, and roses shed a couch, 
                              While evening draws her crimson curtain round, 
                              Trust your soft minutes with betraying man. 
                           
                         
                        THOMSON'S SEASONS. 
                      
                   
                  OF late Lionel Harrington had had fair luck in play. He had won considerable sums of money-an unusual occurrence with him-which was now being spent by him and his sister Carrie, as fast as he had obtained it. They were still living-rather secluded and forsaken, however-at their old residence at Clifton, still belonging to Reuben Armhold, who had suffered them to remain in the house for which he had, as yet, no use for himself. Lionel, on this particular night, was as usual away from home, trying his luck at a game of draw. Carrie was at home. She was dressed in a dark and well-fitting suit of maroon delaine, and was thoughtfully walking up and down the drawing-room, in whose grate a bright fire was burning. Now and then she would stop before the window and look into the dark outside. Sometimes a sigh would escape her lips, and then again a tear would roll down her cheeks, as she alternately paced the floor or threw herself upon the sofa. 
                  Something unusually heavy must have been weighing down her heart, for she was more than unusually depressed and impatient. At last the barking of the dog in the yard made her raise her head in an attitude of listening. Some one had arrived, and was now ascending the stairs. She knew the footsteps; it was Broadwell's. He was coming along the hall and toward the door. He did not knock; he simply turned the knob and entered. 
                  Carrie, who was seated on the sofa, did not raise her eyes-did not welcome him. This conduct did not surprise him; she had often such moods, when she would not speak a word for hours. He therefore simply drew a chair to the fire and sat himself down to warm his feet by it. Carrie watched him for a second, and, as she did so, her once beautiful and even now still interesting face, underwent a change. It turned actually green-a sickly green-and her eyes began to glisten. 
                  "Broadwell!" 
                  It was uttered in a clear, distinct voice, but scarcely above a whisper, and yet it sounded like a death knell in his ears. He rose and stepped half-way across the room, then halted. What made his pulse beat faster than common? Was he conscious of something that could make him feel uneasy? 
                  "Come here," in the same low, distinct voice. 
                  He approached nearer and gazed into her eyes, and another pang shot through his heart. At any other time he would have taken a seat by her side and asked her the reason of her strange conduct; but now he hesitated, and stopped just in front of her. 
                  "What do you want, Carrie?" 
                  She raised her eyes and looked into his, not a muscle of her face stirring. A moment later she was all agitation. Her bosom beat faster, her breath came quicker, and her lips grew paler, and quivered. 
                  "You have ruined me!" 
                  This was all she said, but it was quite enough to congeal the blood in his thin, blue veins. He gave a start, as if struck by lightning, and riveted his eyes upon her face. 
                  "What!" he shrieked, as the true meaning of her words flashed upon his mind. "I have ruined you?" 
                  "Yes, you have ruined me!" and she covered up her face and began to weep. 
                  "Are you not mista-" 
                  The other syllable was choked in his throat. Carrie had dashed from her seat to throttle him. 
                  "Wretch!" she shrieked. "What! do you want to deny it-do you want to deny it? Say, do you?" 
                  Her hands were still tight around his neck, her face was as red as a tulip, and her eyes were wildly rolling in their sockets. 
                  "I am just mad enough to kill you! Haven't I told you a thousand times that I would kill both you and myself if you should ruin me? And now I am ruined! Give me a knife-give me a knife! I want to kill myself-I want to kill myself!" 
                  Here she broke down, and began to sob aloud. She released her hold on Broadwell's neck, and threw herself, shrieking, upon the sofa. 
                  "Say! do you want to have all the servants up here?" he hissed in return, and placed his hands upon her mouth to drown her voice. "Say! do you want to ruin me emphatically? Do you want to make a scene of it? Why, then, do it!" and he commenced, mere like a maniac than a person sound in mind, to rush up and down the room. 
                  Carrie dried her eyes, raised her head, and watched her seducer with a peculiar interest, as he, with a face upon which terror and horror were depicted, dashed by her like one bereft of his wits. 
                  He stopped short in the middle of the room, looked at her once more just as she was coughing, then down he threw himself upon the floor, and began to scream aloud. It was enough to overthrow Carrie's equanimity. Now she too began to sob, and covered up her face with her hands. No sooner did her wails reach his ears than he leaped to his feet, and once more, only with redoubled fury, rushed up and down the room. His few thin hairs were wildly scattered over his temples, and from his eyes shone a dangerous gleam, as he rushed up to where she sat, and, once more placing his hands before her mouth, hissed: 
                  "Say, do you want to drive me mad? Do you really want to drive me mad?" 
                  "Where is a knife?" 
                  "Hold your tongue!" 
                  "I want to kill myself!" and she darted from her seat and rushed to the other end of the room, as if in the act to execute her threat. But a moment later she was once more lying on the sofa, her face hid in her hands. 
                  A long pause of terrible suspense ensued. Broadwell was almost out of his wits. This news, which had taken him so by surprise, had stunned him. He moved toward the window, and looked out into the dark. The wind, as it whistled through the naked treetops, gradually had the effect to calm his agitated heart and restore to him his thinking faculties. 
                  He turned around, retraced his steps, and seated himself on the sofa by Carrie's side. After looking at her a moment, he said: 
                  "What's done is done." 
                  She did not answer, but continued to weep. 
                  "There's no use in crying." 
                  "O, I wish I were dead!" she now exclaimed. Broadwell wished so too, but did not say it. "If I can not conceal my shame," she added, "I will kill myself." 
                  "Now, there is no use of talking in this manner, for if you do, we can never come to any conclusion. Something must be done," and as his eyes wandered over her figure, he added, "and that speedily, too. Does Lionel know of it?" 
                  "No." 
                  Broadwell felt easier. 
                  "Have you revealed it to any one?" 
                  "Not to a living soul." 
                  "Well, what did you intend to do?" 
                  She looked at him a moment, and then said: 
                  "I intended to tell you that you had blasted my whole future; intended to force you to right me." 
                  "What do you mean by 'right me?' Do you want me to marry you?" 
                  "I know you can not marry me, even if you had the desire to do so." 
                  "Well, what do you want?" he said, considerably irritated. 
                  "I don't know what I want, but I must be righted. For listen!" and she pointed her index-finger toward his face: "if you can not help me to conceal my shame, I'll kill you-you know I will!" 
                  Broadwell felt considerably troubled. He did not like the tone of her voice. 
                  "Your shame shall be concealed," he said, at last. "Only give me time to think over it till to-morrow, will you? I'm too much confused to do any thing now." 
                  He rose, and began thoughtfully to pace the floor. Fifteen minutes passed in this manner. At the expiration of that time, he once more sat down by her side. He took her hand in his, and stroked it gently. 
                  "Carrie," he said, "will you answer me a question truly and faithfully?" 
                  She opened her eyes and looked at him in wonder. 
                  "Yes," she answered, "I will." 
                  "It's a great pity," he said, after a short pause, and once more he began to study. 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Carrie, I have discovered a plan, not only how to obtain a father for your child, but also a husband for yourself." 
                  "What would you do?" 
                  He whispered something in her ear that brought the blood to her cheeks and a strange fire into her eyes. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER IX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              There is, sir, a critical minute in 
                              Every man's wooing when his mistress may 
                              Be won, which if he carelessly neglect 
                              To prosecute, he may wait long enough 
                              Before he gain the like opportunity. 
                           
                         
                        MARMYON'S ANTIQUARY. 
                      
                   
                  REUBEN left the residence of Mr. Montgomery in anger. Nellie had insulted him, and he was not accustomed to brook insult. If he even had not conducted himself as he should have done in her presence, he thought, as he hurried along Ninth-street, was his offense so great that she was justifiable in fleeing his presence? In his own mind it was a settled thing. Nellie had only been playing with his feelings; had only thrown out baits, such as mischievous ogles, tender looks, tenderer words, and now and then given him permission to feel the warmth and softness of her small white hands, in order to see whether he would bite, and-he did bite, fool that he was. His pride was wounded, deeply wounded. We believe if he had met her at that moment, and not been denied the privilege of addressing her, he would have made her feel the bitterness of his tongue. But he did not meet her then; so he gratified his injured pride with meditating on revenge as soon as the proper hour should arrive. In the mean time he was nearing the clubhouse. Two hours before he had made up his mind never more to enter that house-never more to touch a card. Two hours ago he had called his whole life a lie, had laughed at his own weakness, had forgiven every one who had ever injured him, had even pardoned Thornton and his accomplice, and had determined upon a line of conduct that was not only to redeem his past, but was to bring glory and honor upon his name. He had felt himself capable of accomplishing almost any thing great. Lofty thoughts had entered his mind, and, for the first time in his life, he regretted the many years he had suffered to steal over his head without attempting to make a mark upon the scroll of fame. Pervaded by these feelings, and impressed with these ideas, he had sought the presence of Nellie; with feelings of enmity toward all mankind, and toward Nellie in particular, he now entered the club-room, which, to his great surprise, he found almost vacated. He had expected to meet there both Broadwell and Lionel Harrington; but neither had yet come, said one of the loungers; so Reuben, without saying any thing in reply, turned about, and shortly afterward was making his way back to the Montgomerys. 
                  He did not heed the cold weather; the sharp, biting air seemed to do him good. He simply buttoned his overcoat; and people muffled up in warm shawls and comforters, hurrying by him, envied him the robustness and hardiness with which nature had blessed him. Other thoughts were passing through his mind, however. Jealousy had by some means found birth within the last few minutes in his bosom, and was stubbornly ploughing its way to his head. Never before had he experienced such a gnawing upon his heart; he actually felt as if he had eaten nothing for twice four and twenty hours, and yet he was bereft of the appetite that generally accompanies hunger. We know he would have left the most savory meal untouched; for jealousy feasts only upon heart and mind, and Reuben had a goodly share of each. 
                  As he came near enough, he could discover that the gas in Montgomery's parlor was still unextinguished. A bitter smile passed over his lips, and the gnawing at his heart increased. A sensation of faintness was actually coming over him, as if his nerves had grown lax and were being unstrung. He really halted for a second, as if undecided how to proceed. Just then a shadow crept up the parlor wall; that shadow passed also over his face, darkened his eyes, darkened his mind, darkened his heart. He bit his lips, took a long breath, and-moved forward. 
                  He would have sworn that Lionel was with Nellie in the drawing-room, though Montgomery had, as he was well aware, forbidden Carrie's brother admittance to his house. Jealousy reasons not; it has its fixed ideas, and sees in every thing a black and blear-eyed raven. 
                  Reuben's mind was made up: he would spoil that 
                     tete-a-tete before another minute should pass by. Without shaping or having any definite idea how to take his revenge on both Nellie and Lionel, he opened the front door-for he had a key-and rushed into the drawing-room. 
                  But not far. He scarcely passed over the threshold. He stopped right short, and felt a sense of shame come over him. On the sofa Nellie was seated by herself, and evidently enjoying the company of-a book. Frightened-as any lady would have been, thus taken by surprise-at his impetuosity, she had palpably given evidence of that sensation by shrinking within herself and dropping the book from her hand. 
                  What a fool he had been, he thought. He could have laughed at his boyish folly, had not a feeling of unfeigned sorrow, for the pain he had so unnecessarily occasioned Nellie, almost made him weep. While she looked at him, full of surprise, he felt as he had never felt before. He was sure that he loved her, and that his life, if not happily united with hers, would be worse than a curse to him. Again his better nature-the pristine purity of his soul-phnix-like, rose from the dead ashes of his hopes, and sanctified, with the sanctity of self-redemption, every thought of his mind. Quicker than the lightning's flash, or the birth of a thought itself, his dead mother's image passed before his mind's eye, and dropped a sunbeam in his heart. 
                  A sweet, short laugh-sweet as the tinkling music of a silver bell suspended in the air-aroused him from his short reverie, and made his soul go forth with all the loveliness of its own heaven toward that fair and blue-eyed beauty who sat, her gaze upturned to his, still wondering and-admiring. 
                  Her voice was still ringing in the air when he dropped upon his knees, and exclaimed, with a somewhat suppressed tone: 
                  "Forgive me, Nellie! I will never more so offend you. I was mad." 
                  Another silvery laugh, and sweeter than before, if possible, rose from her throat and sent its music into his soul. 
                  "Rise, Mr. Armhold," she said, her eyes full of mischief; "or shall I come and help you?" 
                  He did not wait for her assistance; in an instant he was upon his feet and advancing further into the drawing-room. 
                  "That's right, Mr. Armhold," she said, as she saw him draw a chair toward her. "Sit down here by my side and tell me-but don't come too near me, for you see that door yonder; I escaped through it once, and may do so again-and tell me for what transgression I am to forgive you?" 
                  "Nellie, I have been rude. I have not conducted myself toward you as a gentleman should. If you will pardon me for this once, I will promise you, by the love I have always borne my mother, never more to offend you thus." 
                  Nellie had been looking at his serene face ever since he had taken his seat, and had seen it, as he addressed her, grow so noble in expression, that she could not even now, after he was done speaking, keep her eyes away from it. For something like a moment she watched him closely, and imagined to detect something in his looks which made the life-blood blood rush to her cheeks, dyeing them crimson. A moment later she once more burst out into a laugh, and merrily exclaimed: 
                  "O, men, men! don't I know you? Always sinning against us-always repenting of it! What a pity that each repentance is followed by a far greater offense than the one that preceded it-and that we, silly fools, so readily forgive! You, Mr. Armhold, are no better than the rest." 
                  "I know I am not better than the rest," he replied, humbly, and yet with a fervency that did not escape Nellie's observation; "in fact, I know that I am far inferior, and even worse than they. But I am no less sincere in my promise no more to offend, than I have been impudent in offending. Say, Miss Nellie, that you will ascribe it to the madness under which I have labored, and I shall feel more at ease than I do now." 
                  "I shall do no such thing," she replied, laughing. "What! ascribe it to your madness? What! ascribe it to a want of good sense in gentlemen to pay their addresses to me? No, indeed! Would you have me believe that it is not in my power to be loved by any man of sense?" And, while a clear, silvery laugh wound up her remark, she gracefully tossed her head aloft, displaying a neck as white as that of a swan's, and as beautifully rounded as that of the goddess of love. 
                  "No, I would not have you think so, Nellie. Though I believe you could turn the wits of the strongest man, and make him mad with love, still the greatest mind could and would be proud to possess you." 
                  Again that wild, mischievous laugh, accompanied with the clapping of her beautiful, tiny hands. 
                  "I hope you do not wish to compliment me," she said. 
                  "Nellie, you know it is not in my nature to compliment any body, and least of all-you." 
                  "Why so, Mr. Armhold?" 
                  "Because I love you!" 
                  
                     Because I love you! These words penetrated Nellie's heart to the core; and if there is such a thing as a pang which partakes as much of pleasure as it does of pain, she felt it at that moment. It was her intention to laugh right out, and make fun, and amuse herself at this remark; but the laugh did not come at will, and she feared to force it, for she felt sure its very tone, by its strangeness, would arouse suspicion. She didn't trust herself this time, and hence only nodded her head, and said, with a faint smile: 
                  "A thousand others have told me the same tale, and, I have no doubt, had made the like confessions to other ladies-who knows?-perhaps on the self-same days and with the same assurances. It is hard to trust them." 
                  "Trust me, Miss Nellie." 
                  "Trust you?" This time she laughed-laughed loudly-but it was a failure; she knew and felt it, and she was convinced that Reuben detected its hollowness. 
                  "Yes, trust me." 
                  A pause of a second ensued, which, short as it was, sufficed to revolutionize Nellie's feelings. Her heart began to palpitate, and turning somewhat paler, and withdrawing her gaze from his face, she said, in rather a low tone: 
                  "Trust you with what?" 
                  "With your love, Nellie-with your love." It was said in a whisper, but, nevertheless, it brought the red blood to her cheek. He drew a little nearer, took her right hand in his and tremblingly stroked it. The touch, like electricity passed through her frame, but she remained calm, and with her eyes still bent upon the floor, heard him repeat, with accents still lower than the first-"with your love, Nellie; with your love." 
                  Still she remained silent, and still she suffered him to stroke her hand. But the silence grew oppressive-she felt a strange power creep over her; she feared to give way to it, and yet she was loath to resist it. Just then she slyly raised her eyes to his, and as they encountered their soft glances, he once more repeated, "love me." 
                  It was more than she could stand. She must fall upon his bosom, or resist it at once, ere that strange feeling had complete control over her. 
                  She tossed up her head, jerked her hand away from his, and feigned anger. 
                  "You want to fool me, Mr. Armhold," she said, and rose to leave his presence. He grasped to catch her hand, but failed in doing so until he had caught up with her in the middle of the room. 
                  "Won't you listen to me?" he exclaimed, falling upon his knees, determinately holding her hand. 
                  "If you don't release me"-the grasp tightened-"'Pa-" loud and full of anger. 
                  Reuben watched her pale face for a second, then dropped her hand and rose to his feet. He stepped back a few paces. Her eyes were still on him, and as he looked steadily and calmly at her, exhibiting not the least fear, she imagined he had never looked more beautiful and dignified than now as the footsteps of her father were nearing the parlor door. 
                  "Did you call, daughter?" he inquired, as he slowly came along the hall. 
                  Her eyes were still bent on Reuben. Now she turned her face toward the door, and said, louder than was necessary, "No!" 
                  The old man went back, and Nellie threw herself upon the sofa, covered up her face, and began to sob aloud. 
                  "You are an angel, Nellie, and I am not worthy of a tear you shed," Reuben said in a choked voice, as he advanced toward the door, with the intention of leaving the room. But before he had scarcely gone half the distance he arrested his steps and turned around. 
                  Nellie had called him. Her face was raised and turned to his. She was still sobbing, but he was calm-as calm as he had always been when angrily brooding over the past-but this time a sadness had taken the place of that repelling hardness which his facial expression at such times exhibited. His eyes met hers with an inquiring, steady gaze. They did not flinch-they evidently felt no shame for what had been done. 
                  "I don't know," she said, amid sobs, "by what right you persist in affronting me." 
                  "Miss Montgomery, I can't excuse my conduct; it is that of a coward and a ruffian." 
                  "Well, why don't you behave yourself better?" She still continued to sob. "I'm sure, if you had the least respect for me you would not have acted in this manner." 
                  Reuben waited a moment before he answered: when he did answer it was in these words: 
                  "Respect for you, Nellie? Respect for you? If I have not offended you too much, O, Nellie, Nellie, then give me leave-right here where I now stand, for I shall never more draw nearer to you-to open you my heart. I love you, Nellie-nay, do not shrink-and in that love I forgot myself. I had come here to tell you that I had resolved to change my course of life; that I was ashamed of the manner in which I had idled away so many years, and had determined upon a course that would not only redeem my past, but open to me a future bright as ambition and hope could paint to my mind. That I should no longer throw dice or play cards, but grow to become a useful member of society, forget and forgive all my enemies, and only live, Nellie, aye, live only for you. For in you I saw my better angel, and my heart went out to you seeking your love in return. I felt as if another spirit had entered my soul, and I began to love mankind in you. But I was a fool, Nellie, to dream of such happiness-I know I was a fool." 
                  He said no more. Contrary to what might have been expected-for he had said he would not approach her-he advanced to where she sat, her head lowered over her bosom, and reached out his hand to her. 
                  "Give me your hand, Nellie; I feel you have forgiven me." 
                  She looked up, and saw that manly figure towering above her like some god. She gave him her hand, and, as it rested for a moment in his broad palm, she felt her own weakness. 
                  "Good-night, and forget that I spoke to you of love," he said. 
                  He released her hand, but it did not glide from his own until he moved away. 
                  "Reuben!" 
                  He looked around and stopped. 
                  "Are you not making fun of me?" she added. 
                  "Nellie!" 
                  "And do you really love me?" 
                  "O, Nellie, Nellie, how can you ask me?" 
                  Once more their eyes met. Nellie rose from her seat, rushed forward and threw herself in Reuben's arms, sobbing upon his bosom. 
                  "Do you love me?" he whispered. 
                  "You know I do;" and she twined her arms still closer around his neck. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER X. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Despair takes heart, when there's no hope to speed; 
                              The coward then takes arms and does the deed. 
                           
                         
                        HERRICK. 
                      
                   
                  FOR something like ten minutes after she had left the house of Jane, Hannah rushed along Central Avenue, her mind filled with confused thoughts, quite unconscious, however, of the attention she was drawing upon herself from many a passer-by who wonderingly stared at that wild, blank gaze that seemed riveted on some far distant object. At once she stopped and pressed her hand across her brow; she felt the cold perspiration and shivered, then-hurried on again. Another five minutes passed, and Hannah might still have been seen traversing now this and now that street. At last she arrived in the neighborhood of several lighted-up business houses. Again she halted, and this time approached the door and looked through the window-panes. She espied a gentleman at the further end of the store; she heaved a sigh and entered. 
                  The young gentleman, as soon as he discovered the entrance of the lady, without going behind the counter, walked to the front of the store, politely bowing as he came near enough, then said: 
                  "What can I do for you, ma'am?" 
                  The voice was so sweet that Hannah imagined an angel speaking to her. 
                  "I have a favor to ask of you," she said. 
                  The young gentleman gazed at her for a moment, then said: 
                  "What is it I can do for you?" 
                  "Much, sir; much, sir," she replied, lifting imploringly her sad, but still beautiful blue eyes to his beardless face. "You are a stranger to me-but what matters it-strangers are at times kinder than our own friends. I have starving children at home-I am not accustomed to begging-but, for the love of God, give me money to buy bread with." 
                  Notwithstanding her swollen face, there was something irresistibly attractive about her that did not fail to draw the young man's attention. 
                  "Will you walk back to the fire for a second?" he inquired. 
                  "No, thank you; I seem to hear my children cry for bread, and every moment now seems a year of agony to me. Pray, let me have some money, and I will bless you." 
                  "How, my dear;" and he twined his arm around her waist, and was about to press her to his bosom, and print a kiss upon her cheeks, when she, with the anger of a fury, tore herself loose and dealt him a blow that sent him reeling and bleeding half way across the store. 
                  Once more upon the street; once more at the mercy of the cold, cold wind. But what cared she now for cold or heat? She hurried on until she came to a bakery. She entered, asked for a loaf of bread. A fat jolly and round-faced baker-lad with a white apron tied around his waist and a paper cap on his head, waited on her. She took the bread and walked toward the door. 
                  "You haven't paid me yet," said the bakerlad. 
                  "Where is your master?" 
                  "He is in the beer-house." 
                  "I always buy my bread here. He knows me and-I only pay at the end of every week." 
                  Hannah was lying, and the lad could see it. 
                  "You must come in when he is here;" and he took the bread from her. 
                  She was ashamed to look around, for a small girl was in the shop buying quite a lot of cakes, and had them packed in a paper bag. 
                  Hannah once more rushed along the street toward her home, to which it was now but a short distance. Just then a child in one of the houses she was passing cried violently, and reminded her of her own starving children. 
                  She stopped, turned and looked along the street she had just passed. A wicked idea had entered her mind. Once more she retraced her steps until she came to a place where a partial concealment from any comer's view was possible, then halted. 
                  Something approaching toward her made her recommence her walk slowly. A moment later the little girl she had seen in the baker-shop passed by her. In another moment that little girl lay crying on the hard pavement, while Hannah was fleeing through an alley with a large pack of cakes in her arms. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              WHY tarries he so long, while she-that one 
                              So fond and true, so beautiful and bright- 
                              Now sits in cheerless watchfulness alone, 
                              Waiting his coming through the tedious night? 
                              And as the chimes upon the distant bell 
                              Mark mournfully and sad his lingering stay, 
                              Each echoing peal seems but the gloomy knell 
                              Of joys departed, pleasures passed away. 
                           
                         
                        SAMUEL D. PATTERSON. 
                      
                   
                  AS low as Broadwell had fallen, and as little as he cared for the bad opinion his conduct had raised in the minds of the persons he knew, and with whom he had come more or less in contact, he still dreaded the consequences that the exposure of this last act of his would entail upon him. The members of his church who had honored-almost revered-him, no longer recognized him; but he cared not. He knew that they thought him beneath their notice, but it had raised no sense of shame in his mind. He was very depraved-had committed numerous crimes, to answer a single one of which would have been sufficient to sentence him to the penitentiary, but for which he had never felt the least shame or compunction. He had been a cold and implacable villain, who had labored for the concealment of his crimes only as long as that concealment served his purpose, but no sooner had he discovered that he could no longer play the gentleman than he had thrown off the mask and appeared the hideous thing he was. All the entreaties of his wife and those of his friends who had not forsaken him at his first steps downward without a trial to reclaim him, had been vain. He had been determined upon leading a reckless life, and-he had led one. But the disclosure of Carrie having so unexpectedly fallen upon his ears, had first amazed, then maddened, and at last cowed him to the very earth. He had never committed a deed of shame without having known what the extent of the consequences might have been, and yet he had committed crime after crime without a single look ahead. But this time, aye, this time he trembled, and felt the coward spirit get the better of him. For he had listened to a disclosure the consequences of which he could not even surmise. The future was dark to him, and in whatever way he looked, danger stared at him. He imagined to see now Carrie, now Lionel, now his wife, now Reuben, and now all combined, standing before him like so many enraged Nemesises, bent upon revenge. 
                  Thus perplexed in mind and cowed in spirit he reached his home that night just as the cathedral clock struck twelve. Noiselessly-a consideration he had never before shown to his family-he ascended the two flights of stairs and opened the door, then, coward-like, crawled into the room. It had been his prayer to find his wife asleep, and-his prayer, and that without any special interference of Providence, was answered. His wife was asleep, he could hear her breath rise and fall at regular intervals. He would not disturb her, he would let her sleep on. So he pulled off his boots and walked, his feet scarcely touching the floor, away into the opposite corner to prepare himself for retiring. 
                  He had scarcely reached the centre of the room, when he stopped and listened. He turned his eyes, dark as it was, toward the couch his wife occupied. A pang shot through his heart: he could no longer hear
                      
                     her breathing. He felt that she was awake; he could have sunk to the floor for fright. 
                  He waited a moment, then moved on again. Perhaps she is still asleep, he thought, and began to unrobe. 
                  "Broadwell-" 
                  The coat was still in his hands. At the sound of that voice, though it was scarcely above a whisper, he dropped it on the floor. 
                  "Is it you, Broadwell?" 
                  "It is, Hannah." Timid and full of fear. "I thought you were asleep." 
                  She did not answer; she simply rose from the bed and lighted a candle. Broadwell blanched as he saw her still in her dress. Could it be possible that she had been apprised of his intrigue with Carrie before he had been? 
                  He had to wait but a short time to find his doubts removed. 
                  "Why ain't you to bed, Hannah?" he ventured to say, in the sweetest tones he could just then command, while she was placing the candle on the table. "I expected to find you asleep at this hour. Or are you not well, Hannah? Shall I go for a doctor?" 
                  Hannah could not open her eyes wide enough. Was this Broadwell who was speaking to her in that sweet voice? Was this Broadwell who wished to go for the doctor for her? Was this her husband? 
                  It amazed her-amazed her more than if he had come to her bedside and plunged a dagger into her heart. She felt-she knew-that something unusual had occurred to him. She could read it in his half-averted glances. Guilt and fear were written in them. 
                  She could not turn her eyes away from him, so wonderfully changed he appeared to her. He reminded her of a spaniel who had been caught stealing and was waiting its punishment. 
                  She placed the candle on the table. 
                  "Broadwell, you need not go for the doctor," she said, bitterly. "You see, I am well." 
                  "I am truly glad, Hannah," he replied, again in that affectionate tone, that only was calculated to disgust her still more. "I feared I had injured you. Will you forgive me the blow I gave you?" 
                  "Broadwell, sit down and let us talk." 
                  Again that pang shot through his heart. He did as he was bid, but Hannah, pale as death itself, remained standing in front of the table. 
                  "The children are asleep now; I brought them something to eat." 
                  "You are goo-" 
                  "Be still. I said they were asleep and had something to eat. I went out to borrow money-" 
                  "You are an angel!" 
                  "Don't interrupt me!" Still in that terribly calm voice. "I went out to borrow money, but could not get any-don't interrupt me!" her eyes flashed fire and her cheeks turned scarlet. "I went to buy some bread on credit, but the baker would not let me have it. I knew they were starving-"here she observed a pause for several minutes, when she added, spacing every syllable-"so I way-laid a child and robbed it. Now listen, Broadwell, I did this-I, a Preston and the wife of Edgar Armhold; yes, I did this, and even thought not of cursing you-" 
                  "I-" 
                  "Hold your cursed tongue, and don't make me mad before I get through with you. Yes, I did all this, and did not think of cursing you. But now I could give you poison, poison, Broadwell, poison!" 
                  He trembled from head to foot; the scandal had surely reached her ear already, he thought. 
                  "Where did you get this?" And she flung toward him the letter she had written to Edgar, and which Broadwell, as the reader is aware, had reclaimed from the post-office soon after Jane had deposited it there. 
                  He picked up the paper and recognized it at once; and, as quick as lightning relief came to him. 
                  His secret was not known; he did not care for the rest. What if she had found out his treachery? 
                  "Where did you get this?" he inquired, in return. 
                  She looked at him for a second, without uttering a word. Her eyes sparkled, and seemed to shoot from their sockets; her face turned a sickly green-white; her lips trembled, and the violent agitation wrote 'danger' on her spasmodically convulsed features. 
                  "Murderer!" she exclaimed, clenching her fists and gnashing her teeth until the blood rushed to her cheeks and dyed them a deep crimson. "Murderer!" She advanced toward him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder. "What shall I do with you? say, what shall I do with you? Shall I strangle you? you miserable wretch! And this is the reason why my Edgar never returned to me?-Say, shall I strangle you?" 
                  "I reclaimed the letter because I loved you so." 
                  A look of disdain, as only a proud, injured woman can give, fell upon his cowed and humiliated form, as she replied: 
                  "You loved me! You! Wretch that you are, you speak of love!" 
                  "I did love--" 
                  "Hold your tongue! my blood turns to gall just to hear you speak-wretch! I have not slept a wink; I was determined to have speech with you." 
                  "Hannah, forgive me, and I will do all in the future to make you and the children happy." 
                  "From this time forth we are no longer wife and husband." 
                   
                  
                      
                        THE MOONLIGHT RIDE.-EDGAR AND LIONEL. 
                     
                   
                   
                   
                  Her anger was spent. She turned away from him and seated herself by the window. Now tears flowed to her eyes and bathed her cheeks. A whole hour passed and nothing but the wind hissing from without broke the stillness of the night. At last Broadwell rose and moved a step or two toward the centre of the room. 
                  "Hannah!" 
                  She did not answer and he continued: 
                  "You spoke just now of a separation." A short pause and then-"You hate me and have cause for it. If we are to part, let us part in peace and-now." 
                  He said no more; nor was it necessary. To all purposes his intentions were plainly enough expressed. 
                  Hannah slowly raised her head and looked at him in silence. The tears stopped flowing, and her breath seemed to come slower. A new light sprang up in her mind. She reflected for a moment then said: 
                  "What is it?" 
                  Coolly, and without a tremor, he repeated, while the flickering light threw a yellow sheen over his sleeping features: 
                  "If we are to part, let us part in peace, and-now." 
                  "To part!" she said, musingly. 
                  "Yes, Hannah." 
                  "And what of the children?" abruptly. 
                  "Of the children?" You may keep them, for I know you would not like to part with them. I shall, nevertheless, provide for them as best I can." 
                  "To part!" and once more she was lost in reflection. 
                  "I think it best." 
                  Another long pause. Hannah was the first to break it. She turned her pale face toward his, then said in a voice so clear, yet dull and lifeless: "we cannot separate, I wish to God we could!" 
                  "Why can't we separate?" 
                  "Our children-" 
                  She could hold out no longer. Her heart was too full, so she had to weep. 
                  "Our children," she continued. "I must spare them." 
                  "How spare them?" 
                  "They would have to suffer for it, not I. O, God! my God!" she shrieked in the agony of her soul. "Why must children for their parents suffer?" 
                  "They need not suffer on account of our separation." 
                  "But they will, I know they will. And I would sooner die," she sobbed, "than give the bad, bad world another chance to stigmatize my children. No, no, we cannot part. The wife could smile and see her husband leave her forever; but the mother, with a mother's heart, looks only to her children and her children's welfare, and, therefore, rather suffers all injuries from their father, buries her griefs in the recess of her heart, than expose him or separate from him." 
                  "Then, if we can not part, as you say we must try to live together in peace." 
                  "Broadwell, listen to me once more." 
                  "I will." 
                  "We know ourselves too well to speak equivocally. It is best we come at once to an understanding. Things have come to such a pass that a change must take place. I will forget the past; never more recur to it. It is the future that now engages my mind. Will you from this time forth try to make a living for our children? Mind, I ask nothing for myself; I am done with the world, and without a single murmur will bear your insults, blows and curses, so you spare my children, give them food, and bring no other disgrace upon their poor little heads.' 
                  "Hannah, I will surely reform." 
                  "Are you serious, Broadwell?" 
                  "I am." 
                  "Do not revive a spark of hope in me if you intend to extinguish it again." 
                  "It was my intention to tell you, as I came home, that I had made up my mind to mend my ways." 
                  "Broadwell!" and she rose from her seat, and with her former dignified gait, advanced toward him; "Broadwell, I will believe you. I will believe that God has heard my prayers and seen my tears, and, in pity for my poor little darlings, has opened your eyes to your duties. Let us say no more." 
                  And so the two relapsed into silence, listened to the town-clock strike three, then retired to rest. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              "Trust in thee?" Aye, dearest, there's no one but must, 
                              Unless truth be a fable, in such as thee trust! 
                              For who can see heaven's own hue in those eyes, 
                              And doubt that truth with it came down from the skies; 
                              While each thought of thy bosom, like morning's young light, 
                              Almost ere 'tis born, flashes there on the sight! 
                           
                         
                        C. F. HOFFMAN. 
                      
                   
                  REUBEN ARMHOLD was happy-happy for the first time in his life. He loved, and was beloved in return. He had entered a new existence, over which joy-joy such as he had never felt before-presided. The future was no longer dark to him; he had now something to live for. Nellie had become his guiding-star, and in her eyes he beheld a light that was to show him the way to redemption. Hundreds of means his mind had conceived by which he might make himself worthy of the love he had gained. Ambition was aroused in him, and he determined upon accomplishing deeds of praise. Nellie should not only love him, but she should have a right to be proud of him. He would ascend the ladder of fame, shrinking neither from study nor labor until he had gained an eminence far beyond the reach of ordinary men. He would from this time forth devote his hours to one study or another-he had not yet decided upon any particular one-and fight his way through all impediments to success. He had gained Mr. Montgomery's consent to Nellie's hand, but the betrothal was to be kept a secret until the following spring, when Reuben would choose his future calling. 
                  "Nellie," he said to her one day, shortly after their betrothal, "do you love me as well as if I were a Christian? or does the difference in our beliefs dampen, to some extent, your ardor for me?" 
                  "Reuben, why ask this question? You know that I have no prejudices; and even if I had, my love for you would be to deeply rooted not to expel them." 
                  "It makes me strong to hear you say so," he exclaimed, a bright glow lighting up his large black eyes. "My life has been a sad one until I learned to love you; and now, Nellie, I only regret, and deeply-more deeply than I can tell you-that I am unworthy of you. But you shall have no cause to complain of me in the future. I shall do something to redeem my name. I need nothing but your smile to encourage me, and I can accomplish almost any thing. For I will look neither here nor there, but right straight into your eyes, Nellie, and it will keep me steadfast to my purpose, and guard me from temptation." 
                  Nellie looked at his noble figure with an eye of admiration. She drew nearer to him, and suffered his strong, sinewy arm to twine itself around her slender waist. 
                  "Reuben," she said, a smile curling her rosy lips, "do you know that you make me jealous at times?" 
                  Reuben laughed right out, and pressed her to his heart. 
                  "Don't! you hurt me. Yes, you make me jealous at times." 
                  "How, Nellie?" 
                  "You are so good-looking, and there are so many handsomer girls than I am, who would be glad to take you away from me." 
                  "Now, don't be foolish, Nellie." 
                  "I am not foolish, Reuben. I know what I say. You men can not be trusted much;" and she smiled so irresistibly upon him that he simply answered her with a kiss. 
                  "Then you will not love any one else but me?" 
                  "Nellie!" 
                  "Answer me" 
                  "Do you think me both weak and wicked enough to deceive you?" 
                  "No, I do not, Reuben; for I think you a man-a whole man, every inch of you a man-and that's the reason why I love you. But you go so often-I think too often-up to Clifton Avenue, and-you know I'm foolish-I don't like it." 
                  "I hope you are not jealous of Carrie Harrington?" 
                  "Yes, I am;" and she hid her face on his bosom. 
                  "Are you not ashamed to say so?" and he raised her face to his, so he could see her eyes. 
                  "Should I be?" she said, and, throwing her arms around his neck, pressed her cheek against his own. "Ain't I a big fool? I know you love no one else but me-or do you?" 
                  "Nellie, you are the first and only woman, with the exception of my mother, that I ever loved." 
                  "O, God, how good you are! And you care not the least bit for Carrie? I know you do not; do you, Reuben dear?" and she gently stroked his hair. 
                  "Nellie, ever since I have learned to know Miss Harrington, I have taken a particular interest in her. She is a good companion, and knows how to entertain a guest. Besides, I know that she has great griefs, and on that account, if on no other, I have extended to her my friendship. She seems forsaken by almost all her kin; and I thought the little I could do for her to make her happier, should not be withheld. Have I done right?" 
                  "You have, and I love you for it," she replied. 
                  And in this manner a fortnight passed, Reuben daily growing happier and happier. He had deserted the haunts of vice, and had begun to live in a purer sphere. He had heard nothing from Broadwell, Lionel, or Carrie for some days, until, one evening, while he was sitting by Nellie's side, a servant entered the drawing-room and handed him a letter. He opened it in her presence, and read aloud: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              "MR. ARMHOLD-Dear Sir: Excuse the liberty I take in addressing you. I have been looking for you for the last fourteen days, but as I have not had the pleasure of seeing you ere this, as I expected, I must beg you now, as you value my life and honor, to call on me this evening. I can not trust more on this paper. Once more, as you value my honor, let me pray you to come at once. Yours, respectfully, 
                              
                                 "CARRIE HARRINGTON."
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  When Reuben got through reading the letter, he turned his eyes upon Nellie. He observed that she had changed color, and grown thoughtful. 
                  "Nellie dear," he said, closing up the note, "look into my face." 
                  She did so with reluctance. 
                  "Do you doubt me?" 
                  She gazed into his eyes, and scanned his features. Honor shone through the former, and was written on the latter. 
                  "Do you doubt me?" 
                  She fell upon his bosom, and whispered, "No!" 
                
                
                   
                  CHAPTER XIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              I'll keep this secret from the world, 
                              As warily as those that deal in poison 
                              Keep poison from their children." 
                           
                         
                        WEBSTER'S "DUCHESS OF MALFI." 
                      
                   
                  IT was late that evening when a servant announced the arrival of Reuben Armhold to Carrie Harrington. The announcement did not take the latter by surprise; she knew that he would respond in person to her letter. And yet, no sooner had she heard his name pronounced than an unusual pang shot through her heart, and the little color the bright fire, before which she had been seated for something like an hour, had lent her cheeks, died suddenly away, and left them pale as death. 
                  "He is below, in the drawing-room; shall I tell him you will be down?" inquired the servant. 
                  Carrie thought for a moment, and then answered: 
                  "No; tell him to come up." 
                  The servant retired to deliver her message, and her mistress rose from her seat and threw herself upon a sofa. She was still thinking of the interview she had had that day with Broadwell, and now, as Reuben's steps fell upon her ears, she would have given worlds to be dead rather than to perform that part she had pledged herself to Broadwell to enact. But she was not dead, and in less than a second Reuben would be in her presence. The steps came still nearer; she turned paler, sicklier, experienced a painful palpitation of the heart, heaved a long sigh, and then-raised her eyes to gaze upon her visitor. 
                  "Good evening, Miss Carrie," he said, smilingly, extending his right hand to her. "You see that I have obeyed your order as it becomes a true and chivalrous knight, and came hither as fast as horse could carry me. But tell me, what is the matter? Do you know that your note has already made me fell uneasy? And now, while I look at you and behold your pale features, I do not feel in the least relieved of my anxiety. Is there any thing I can do for you, Miss Carrie? If there is, say so." 
                  He did not wait to be asked to be seated; he drew a chair in front of the sofa where Carrie lay, and sat down before her and took her hand in his. It was icy cold, and it trembled. Reuben gave it a soft pressure, and said, in a rather gentler tone: 
                  "You are not quite well, Carrie; I can see it in your face, and know it by the coldness of your hand. Tell me, where is Lionel? Does he know that you are sick?" 
                  Until now she had not uttered a syllable. She had simply listened to him, and had tried to gather courage to commence the part she was about to play. But his words of sympathy were poorly calculated to strengthen her in her resolution, and rather softened the heart she had intended should grow hard as steel. 
                  "Lionel is in the city, I presume," she mumbled, half aloud. 
                  "I do not hear what you are saying, Carrie. Please raise your face a little"-she had thrown one of her arms over it-"and now repeat it to me." 
                  "I said that Lionel is in the city." 
                  "Does he know you are sick?" 
                  "No." 
                  "You ought to have told him, Carrie; but since you have not done so, tell me what is the matter with you, and I shall do all I can for you." 
                  She had been lying on the sofa; now she raised herself to a sitting position. 
                  "Have you been sick long?" Reuben inquired, moving his chair still closer to her. 
                  "I am not sick." 
                  "Not sick?" 
                  She did not reply; but Reuben could see, by the strange expression of her face, that something was the matter with her. 
                  "And if you are not sick," he continued, "what is it that depresses you?" 
                  Now she turned her face, and steadily riveted her eyes upon him. One could easily observe that she was making an effort to raise her courage to say or do something. Her bosom began to heave faster, and her lips, which had been slightly parted, now seemed to stiffen out as if the nerves that passed through them had been hardened and tighter strung. 
                  Reuben watched these for a minute, then, impressed with the idea that she was suffering from a grief which she felt a hesitancy to expose, he once more took hold of her hand and affectionately stroked it, saying: 
                  "Carrie, trust me with your sorrows. Be they what they may, I will serve you. I have seen so much of misery myself, that I can very well feel for others." 
                  Had he stopped here, we believe Carrie would have been overcome by his generosity, confessed the plot into which she had entered to ruin him, thrown herself upon her knees, and asked for his mercy. But he added: "I have been so happy for the last two weeks, that I feel as if I had entered a new life, where there is nothing but love. Therefore, tell me, Carrie, what it is that weighs so heavily upon your heart, and I will help you to remove the load, and try to make you as happy as I have been made by one of your sex." 
                  This last sentence did the work. The words were too plain to be mistaken. He had fallen in love with some one, and felt transported on that account. 
                  A demon entered Carrie's soul. In an instant gall mixed itself with her blood, and ran like a stream of poison through her veins. Her whole facial expression underwent a change, and her eyes, up to this moment so sadly beautiful and open, began to lose that charm which only truth can lend them. 
                   
                  She began to hate him for the love he hinted to entertain for another. She knew well enough that she had not the least claim upon him; that he was free to bestow his affection wherever he pleased. But that mattered little. She was not now in a reasoning mood. Just to hear that another woman was happy, while she was the most wretched of the wretched, was enough to craze her mind. 
                  Why should she shrink from saving herself? Was not the instinct of self-preservation implanted in her bosom as well as in those of others? Could she save her honor by laying the crime upon the guilty party? And if she could, and thereby wipe the last stains of disgrace from her own character, would she be the happier for it? 
                  No-a thousand times no! She felt that unless she be permitted to love something, she would experience death every moment of her life. She felt that she must love, and love she would have, be it purchased at ever so high a price. 
                  She gazed upon Reuben, who sat there in silence, and, for a moment only, a faint smile-so faint that it scarcely appeared to be the shadow of a smile-stole over her lips, but, contrary to her wish, it did not pass unnoticed, for Reuben said, good-humoredly: 
                  "As long as you can smile, there is no danger." 
                  "I did not smile." 
                  Had her mind not yet been made up to save herself, she would have made it up now. For a new idea swept before her eyes, like a dim shadow, which, as it grew more distinct, raised her courage to such a pitch that what she but a minute before would have trembled to perform, she believed would now afford her pleasure to do. 
                  Reuben had risen from his seat, and was slowly walking toward the window. Carrie watched him with a sense of pleasure, for he was possessed of a very handsome figure, full of grace and dignity. Her heart laughed within her as she thought over the joys that she was about to struggle for. And yet she was not quite at ease. 
                  He turned around, and was retracing his steps. He saw that she wanted to say something, so he stopped in the center of the room. 
                  "Reuben," she said, at the same instant falling into tears, "I am undone!" 
                  He did not move away, but kept his eyes upon her as she now, with her head buried in her hands, sobbed aloud. This news had taken him by surprise. He had certainly not dreamed of that; and yet, while his glance still rested upon her, he wondered that he could have been so blind as not to have observed the change which had taken place. 
                  He pitied her from his whole heart. He saw before him a fallen, erring woman, and he would not shrink from saving her honor, if it was for that purpose she had sent for him. 
                  "Stop crying now, and speak to me," he said. 
                  The result of this was more sobs and more tears. 
                  In the presence of misery we are more like ourselves, and throw off the mask which society enjoins us to wear for the purpose of concealing our feelings. 
                  "If you continue in this way, I can't help you, Carrie," he said. "If you want me to assist you, you must be more calm, and tell me all about it. You needn't be ashamed, Carrie, for your indiscretion. Just tell me who is your seducer, and he shall marry you." 
                  "He is gone," she sobbed, "and I am ruined!" 
                  "Now don't be foolish, Carrie," he replied, consolingly, "to take on in this manner. Who is the offender?" 
                  "I can not tell you!" 
                  "This is nonsense, Carrie. You must tell me, if you want me to help you." 
                  "I can not tell you!" she repeated, sobbing louder. 
                  Reuben felt really uneasy; he scarcely knew what to do or say. 
                  "Well, how am I to help you, if you do not give me the name of the offender?" 
                  "I would sooner die than give you his name." 
                  "What would you have me do?" he inquired, perplexed. 
                  "Save me!" 
                  "How?" 
                  "O, take me away-far away, where no one knows me, and I will bless you to the latest day of my life!" she sobbed. 
                  "I will do any thing in the world for you that's reasonable, Carrie. But why conceal his name? I tell you, Carrie, I could and would make him do you justice." 
                  "I can not give you his name; I would sooner die than do it! God! O God! what will become of me?" 
                  "I told you to be calm, Carrie, if you want me to do anything. Does your brother know anything of it?" 
                  "No!" 
                  "Do you mean that he should not find it out?" 
                  "I would sooner take poison than have him know it!" 
                  "Is it still a secret?" 
                  "Not a soul but you knows it." 
                  "And you want to leave this place, and, in so doing, raise no suspicion, Carrie?" 
                  She simply nodded assent. 
                  He rose from his seat, and thoughtfully paced up and down the room. At last he stopped, and, after once more admonishing her to keep quiet, said: 
                  "Do you know of any place to go to?" 
                  "No." 
                  Again he began to walk up and down the room. He did not like the business at all; but he pitied the injured woman, and he was ready to serve her as best he could. 
                  "If we should be able to find a suitable place of concealment, by what time would you wish to leave?" 
                  "O, God! O, God! right now," she shrieked, "I cannot conceal it any longer." 
                  "Well, how could you depart and prevent suspicion? Now dry your tears, and let us talk over this matter calmly." 
                  After the lapse of a few minutes Carrie regained her equanimity and self-composure. 
                  "Have you thought of an excuse for taking your departure?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "What?" 
                  "I shall beg Lionel to let me go to New York city, where a school-mate of mine lives, and I know I can persuade him to give me leave." 
                  It is not necessary to relate what else transpired at this meeting. Suffice it to say that three days later the two left Cincinnati on the Little Miami Railroad; Carrie, as was reported, to visit a friend in New York; and Reuben, without the knowledge of any one, accompanying her. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XIV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              I under fair pretense of friendly ends, 
                              And well placed words of glossy courtesy, 
                              Baited with reason not unplausible, 
                              Wind me into the easy-hearted man, 
                              And hug him into snores. 
                           
                         
                        MILTON'S COMUS. 
                      
                   
                  It was between eight and nine o'clock on the morning of the same day that two persons, a lady and a gentleman, who had arrived at the little village of D-- with the early train from Cincinnati, were seated in the dingy room of a small eating-house, deeply engaged in conversation. Of the two the lady had the most to say, and now and then she would rise from her seat, and step, with as much haste as was possible for her, from one extremity of the room to the other. At last he rose also, and said: 
                  "Well, Carrie, do you think you would be safe enough in this town?" 
                  "I think I should, Reuben." 
                  Reuben Armhold's mind was already made up in regard to obtaining shelter for Carrie. The first thing he did was to inquire of the landlord for such persons who were in the habit of receiving boarders for some length of time. In return he was informed that the people in general never took any boarders, but that there were several other hotels like his in the town where strangers were generally entertained. This reply did not please Reuben, for Carrie had instructed him that she should only be saved from exposure if she could obtain shelter with some private family. So he left the hotel-keeper, who had requested him to register his and the lady's name in the record, and slowly walked through several small and irregular streets. 
                  He met a man who appeared to him to be of a clever disposition. He walked up to him and said: 
                  "Good morning, sir. I am a stranger here in this place who is seeking for a family who would receive a boarder for several months. Do you know any one who would do so in promise of a very liberal pay?" 
                  "I don't know of any one," replied the countryman, "who ever took in strangers, except a lady living at the other end of the down. I tell you what I'll do, I will go down with you if you say so." 
                  Reuben had found the right man to serve him, and felt somewhat pleased at his first success. The ice was broken, and he entertained not the least fear but what he would find out something before long. But before proceeding further in this business he deemed it advisable to draw the country gentleman to one side and prepare him for what could not be concealed. So Reuben placed his arm in that of the other, and commenced in a well-assumed tone of sadness: 
                  "You look like a clever gentleman, friend, and therefore I will not hesitate to tell you, in confidence, for I would not have you reveal it to any one, the position I am placed in." 
                  The countryman was happy; he was about to be entrusted with a secret, and if any thing in the world delighted him, it was the hearing of news. He drew nearer to Reuben and walked slower, while the other now added: 
                  "I am here with a young lady who is my sister, and it is for her that I am seeking a shelter." Here he assumed a sadder tone. "She was engaged to be married to a gentleman who deceived her and took advantage of her simplicity and youth. She is shortly about to become mother, and, as I desire to save my erring sister's reputation, I have taken her away from home and friends to keep her among you, good people, until she may feel well enough again to appear, unsuspected, among her acquaintances. She almost grieves herself to death, and you can imagine how I must feel, who am her own and only brother. Now, do you think that lady will take up my sister, and keep her until I shall return for her?" 
                  "I don't know," replied the man, "but we can see." 
                  Reuben pushed a ten dollar bill in the other's hand, and thus sympathy for the unfortunate girl increased amazingly. 
                  The house was reached and the woman was asked, but she could not be persuaded for any money to take the girl in. Her excuses were various, and no argument could change her resolution. 
                  In less than an hour's time Reuben returned turned to the hotel and reported to Carrie that it was impossible for him to get shelter for her. She turned white as ashes, and would have shed tears once more, if Reuben had not warned her from doing so. 
                  "There is no use in crying," he said. "If we find nothing in this town, all we have to do, is to go farther." Now he related to her how he had met the man who had taken him about town, and what all had transpired. "I felt embarrassed only once," Reuben added, "and that was when I was called upon to register our names." 
                  "How did you register them?" 
                  "As Mr. and Miss Hall; for I thought as brother I would be more likely to command respect both for yourself and me, than if I had passed myself as an acquaintance or a friend of yours. It would have raised suspicion at once, and I would not have been astonished if they had driven us from town." 
                  Carrie trembled, and inquired what he intended to do next. 
                  "I intend to make another effort with the hotel-keeper, and if I can't arrange it with him, we shall leave on the next train." 
                  With these words he descended to the barroom, and after taking a drink, invited the landlord to step out with him in the yard. In less than ten minutes the tale had been told, and the mistress of the house consulted by her husband, whether they should keep Carrie or not. The remuneration was large, the trouble apparently nothing, and-the bargain was closed. 
                  Reuben returned to Carrie, who was now lying on the bed, and said, as he approached her: 
                  "I have completed the arrangements, so you can stay here, Carrie, until you can with safety return to your home. I have paid them three months' boarding in advance, besides the hiring of a servant girl, whose special duty it is to wait on you. Here are an additional hundred dollars--. I would leave more with you, but you might be robbed; whatever you need, all you have to do is to write to me, and you shall receive it by return of mail." 
                  Carrie thanked him, then he advised her in an under tone how she should conduct herself, and what she all had to do during her stay, consoling her, and promising her to come and see her, whenever he could steal away without raising suspicion. In this manner an hour passed, and when the car, a few minutes later, carried Reuben back to Cincinnati, he did not dream that on that day he had committed the gravest and greatest error in the whole course of his life.

                              And after, this: and then to breakfast, with 
                              What appetite you have. 
                           
                         
                        SHAKSPEARE'S HENRY VIII. 
                      
                   
                  IN the morning subsequent to her arrival at the little village of D--, Carrie seated in the small and more than scantily-furnished room which had been assigned to her, indited the following letter: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 D--, December 22, 18-. 
                                 Mr. Charles Broadwell:
                               
                              According to the promise I made to you before my departure from home, I now inform you of my present sojourn. As you can see by the heading of this note, I am in D--, a small uninviting place on the Little Miami Railroad, and about a half day's journey from Cincinnati. Mr. Armhold, after considerable trouble, succeeded at last in obtaining shelter for me-not as I desired it, with a private family-but at one of the few houses in which travelers generally receive accommodation during their brief stay. My landlord is a sulky, penurious wretch, and his wife combines inquisitiveness to the amiable disposition of her husband. I am already tired of this place and only wish I had never left Cincinnati. People are suspiciously looking at me, and consider me-God knows what. I went down to breakfast this morning, and the eyes of at least a dozen ill-mannered boarders kept staring at me as long as I sat there. I could not endure it. I left my seat and hurried up the rickety old steps, back into my room, which, if I can possibly help it, I don't intend to leave again, until I may say good-bye to this place forever. I am known here as Miss Hall, and supposed to be the sister of Reuben. My boarding is paid for three months in advance, but my stay will terminate much shorter. Let me know at once, by return of mail, whether any suspicion was raised on account of my hasty departure. Also, don't forget to inform me who the lady is that had the good fortune to fascinate Reuben. Write to me all and every thing, and keep me from despairing. 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  This letter was duly mailed, and received on the subsequent morning by the person to whom it was addressed. After which the following correspondence took place: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 CINCINNATI, December 23, 18-. 
                                 Miss Carrie:
                               
                              Your note has just come to hand, and I am truly glad that you have found shelter so easily. Here, in Cincinnati, not the slightest suspicion was aroused on account of your departure, and if you evince the least discretion, and manage affairs as we have agreed upon, not only your honor will be saved, but your happiness for the future will be secured. Do not despair, for that you can do when you can't do any thing else. Besides, there is no need for it. Reuben Armhold is in love with no one; but even if he were, I am led to believe, by what I know of your character, that you understand how to prevent him from becoming any one's husband but your own. Let me hear by return of mail the state of your health, and also how you are getting along with Reuben. So far all has worked as well as we could have wished it; it is with you now whether or not we shall be successful throughout. 
                              Lionel is well, and has, like the rest of your acquaintances, not the slightest suspicion. 
                              
                                 C. BROADWELL.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 D--, December 26, 18-. 
                                 Mr. Broadwell:
                               
                              The more I think over the past, the more I get to hate you. Am I really fallen so low that I can know what I have become and not kill myself? Would to God, you miserable wretch, that you had died, as I wish the poor, living thing within me, before you left your mother's womb to contaminate the very air in which you breathe. Is it not enough that I am ruined, and must Reuben Armhold-a man of whom I know nothing but good, and who has done me so many favors-fall with me in the abyss of shame and misery? Broadwell! I can't do it! I have changed my mind! I can't ruin him. How in the name of God can I accuse him and look into his face and tell him he is the father of my child, when he is as innocent as I am guilty? 
                              No, Broadwell, I can't do it. I won't do it. I only wonder that God has not struck me dead, even to have only thought of thus accusing Reuben. I want you to come to me at once, for I must have speech with you. I am almost mad, and can't endure this sort of life any longer. I have not left my room for two days, and every minute I am tormented by my hostess, whose curiosity I am unable to satisfy. This morning she asked me what I intend doing with my child. You don't know how I felt as she propounded this question to me. I thought to sink in the ground. I could not answer her. Come to me and take me away from this place as soon as you can. 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 CINCINNATI, December 27, 18-. 
                                 Miss Carrie:
                               
                              It is a strange thing that a woman, like a chamelion its color, changes her mind every moment. I thought we had come to an understanding, and that you were bent not only upon saving your honor, but also of insuring your future happiness. I can not see for a moment why you should hesitate in carrying out our plan. What has Reuben to lose? Tell me, Carrie, what has he to lose? You accuse him of being the father of your child. Granted. Is he not a young man, and will society require any thing else of him than to do justice to you? And in what consists that justice? You know full well that he simply needs to marry you, and the outraged world will think itself appeased. Why then should you hesitate? Why will you pause in such an emergency? You want a husband for yourself and a father for your child. It is in your power to have both. Refuse them and what will be the consequence? You will be ruined forever, and so will I. I can not marry you-I have one wife too many now-but if I could, what am I but a thin, oldish, bald-headed vagabond when compared to Reuben Armhold? Is there a handsomer man than he in the city? No! What woman would not feel happy in being the wife of a man who is a man in looks and bearing? I have nothing more to add. If you wish to ruin both you and me, why-do it. I do not upbraid you, for a woman in your condition is peevish and fretful, and capable of doing any thing. Every thing is still quiet here; not a soul suspects the least. I have seen Lionel to-day. He tells me that Reuben no longer visits the club room, and that he has taken to hard study. It would not astonish me if you were right in your suspicions. Who knows if Reuben is not in love with some fair damsel? Carrie, lose not a moment. Carry out our plan at once, and our safety will be insured. 
                              I have just returned to add this postscript. There is something in this rumor. Reuben has found some one to love. Would you believe it-it is Nellie Montgomery, the girl who first flirted and then jilted Lionel. Are you willing that she should rob you of a husband and your child of a father? Carrie! Carrie! to work at once! Do you hear me? To work at once! Hesitancy is ruin! 
                              Write to me soon, and any thing that I may hear in connection with this matter I shall let you also know in time. 
                              
                                 BROADWELL.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 D--, January 2, 18-. 
                                 Broadwell:
                               
                              I have done it. Yes, I've done it, and still I live. God didn't strike me dead. Perhaps he has something worse in store for me than death. Perhaps there is no God; at least I hope so. 
                              I wrote to Reuben, and he came to see me this morning. I was sick all night, but still I had him called up to my room at once. A smile was on his manly face, and a hearty welcome shone from his eyes. God! what a change there was when he left me! Never in my life have I seen a man more wretched than he. Tears were in his eyes, and despair in his voice. I know not where I got the courage, aye, the madness to accuse him, face to face, of being the father of my child. How he looked at me and staggered back! How the healthy color fled from his cheeks, and put the stamp of death upon them! He was thunderstruck for a moment, and scarcely believed his own senses. I was afraid, such a terrible aspect assumed his face, that he would choke me to death before I could breathe another word. But he didn't; no, he didn't. He simply dropped upon a chair and kept staring at me. I had not the courage to repeat what I had said to him before, and yet the devil within me urged me to continue. "I must have a father for my child," I said, avoiding his looks, and then began to cry. His face was still as white as a sheet, and he left his chair and approached my bed. "Woman," he said, "are you in your senses, or are you mad?-for mad you must be, else you would not talk so wildly." I had soon undeceived him, and he saw the drift of my conversation. He cursed and would have killed me had he had me in a safer place. He said so, and I believe he would have done it. For in all my life I have never seen a man more agitated than he. But the angrier he got, the prettier, the more god-like he appeared to me, and the more determined I grew to possess him or die. I told him that I loved him; pleaded with him amid tears to forgive this strategy to save my honor, and get the man I loved as a father for my child. You ought to have seen him then; there was not a feature in his whole face, there was not a wrinkle on his brow, there was not a line on his lips, that did not begin to tremble. I thought my last moment had arrived, for he looked unsexed. "Hell-fiend," he shrieked, in a suppressed voice, for both took care that persons who may perchance occupy the adjoining room might not overhear our conversation, "tell me what unearthly fiend has put you up to destroy me?" And as I could not answer him I had recourse to tears. "What!" he continued, "do you think that I will suffer you to ruin me? Is this the reward I am to get for the trouble I have had with you? And is this the manner in which you propose to save your honor? I am to be the father of your child? I? 
                                 I? What else?" 
                              In this manner, Broadwell, Reuben raved on for upward of an hour; but when I at last appealed to him, and said that I would be content if he only promised to help me through, I should never expose him, he simply laughed, and replied that he would sooner be torn into thousand pieces than have anything more to do with me. That if I were not a woman, and a woman in those delicate circumstances, he would strangle me, be the consequences what they might. I know not how it is, but the greater his resistance the more pertinacious I grew. I told him now right plainly what he had to do; that he had to be the father of my child, if I ever were exposed. He refused. I told him I should go back right straight to Cincinnati, and bring charges against him. Broadwell! Broadwell! I hit the nail then. I had no sooner said it, than he blanched, and begged me, aye, begged me, not to ruin him in this manner. I understood in an instant why he dreaded my return. He was in love-yes, in love. But he shall never marry any one else but me-and if he does not marry me, at least no one else shall have him. I have as much right to him as any other woman. I know I am playing a desperate game, but when all is at stake we must plunge ahead. But let me not drift away into a different current. He cooled down, and promised to do any thing in his power to conceal this affair. Again and again he asked me how I had the audacity to accuse him! Broadwell, I believe being long in company with the bad makes one as corrupt as our associates. Had I never seen you I should have been as pure as you are now corrupt; but as it is, I am fallen too low to think about it. I have no longer a heart to pity others or even myself. I told him plainly that I wanted to save myself, and, as I knew of no other way to do it, I had determined upon making him the victim. He did not fly into a passion; I could see he had changed his tactics. He only said, that if I spared his name, he would never forsake me, but help me through this unpleasant affair. And in this state of mind, he left me an hour ago, and before this letter reaches you he will be back in Cincinnati. See whether he takes it easy, and let me know any thing that may happen. I have not written half I intended to write, but I feel exhausted, and therefore postpone the balance for my next. 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  A week later, Reuben received the following letter: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 D--, January 10, 18-. 
                                 Mr. Armhold;
                               
                              I feel very, very sick. I trust you will come by the next train. 
                              
                                 CARRIE HARRINGTON.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  To which he replied: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 CINCINNATI, January 11, 18-. 
                                 Miss Harrington:
                               
                              I am sorry I can not come, as I am otherwise engaged. Besides, I know not how my presence could in the least help you. Be patient only for a few days more, and all will be well. I need not sign my name, as you know the writer. 
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 D--, January 12, 18-. 
                                 Mr. Armhold:
                               
                              You are afraid to sign your name, and think because I can not travel now, that I shall never return to Cincinnati. Though you are otherwise engaged, I think you would have done well to come to me. Remember, I am not to be trifled with. I have once said that you are the father of my child, and you must be it as long as I live. If you don't come to see me at once, I shall come to see you as soon as I can. 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 D--, January 22, 18-. 
                                 Broadwell:
                               
                              I can not hear a word from Reuben. I have written him three letters, he has not answered one. What is he doing? O, I wish I could only travel back to Cincinnati, but I can not. He thinks he has outwitted me. But he is mistaken. Let me only be well again, and I'll show him. I have no longer a heart. I don't care a straw for any thing that may happen. I can't write more; I haven't left my bed for three days. I have two physicians waiting on me, and they are very solicitous about my health. They say if I keep on worrying myself that I will die. I must keep quiet for the present. Write to me.

                                 CINCINNATI, January 23, 18-. 
                                 Carrie:
                               
                              Keep quiet, and don't make yourself any unnecessary trouble. I feel confident that Reuben Armhold would sooner marry you than have you litigate the matter. He is-so report says-betrothed to Nellie Montgomery. If you are steadfast to your purpose, she will never laugh in his embrace.

                              That virtue must go through. 
                           
                         
                        SHAKSPEARE'S HENRY III. 
                      
                   
                  IT was on the evening of the 12th of February that Reuben Armhold sat by the side of Nellie, who was looking into his face, which had grown considerably paler within the last few weeks. 
                  "Reuben," she said, "why so sad and pensive of late? Have I in any manner displeased or offended you? If I have, Reuben dear, tell me, so that I can ask you to forgive me, and promise to be more cautious in the future." 
                  A faint smile passed over his pale cheeks, as he raised her hand to his lips and pressed a kiss upon it. 
                  "Nellie," he said, "you have not offended me. It is not that which makes me sad at times. You know there are persons in the world who care little to destroy the happiness of others; and I fear I have more enemies than is good for me. But let this not trouble you. I have learned to believe that right and justice will, if even late, always conquer the day." 
                  "Something must have happened to you, of which you have kept me ignorant. Come, tell me what it is, so I may share your troubles with you." 
                  "No, Nellie dear, I fain would have you happy always. Do not ask me why I am sad, but be in good spirits, for all will come right again." 
                  "I trust so, for I love you-" 
                  "No," he interrupted her, pressing her to his heart, "you can not love me half as much as I love you. And it is the fear of losing you that makes me so miserable." 
                  Nellie turned pale and trembled. 
                  "Why do you fear to lose me?" she whispered, looking anxiously into his eyes. 
                  "I can not tell you, Nellie. The world is so bad, and it may come between you and me." 
                  "Never, Reuben, never! I shall only cease to love you with my life." 
                  "And if you were to hear that I had done deeds that would place the mark of Cain upon my brow-what then?" 
                  "I would say they libel you, and I would close my ear to all but you." 
                  "And if their charges bore the stamp of truth?" 
                  "I should even then disbelieve them." 
                  "Nellie, I feel strong now, and can endure the worst. I have enemies-enemies who are about to destroy me-and they have found a ready tool for it. Hear me now, Nellie: As long as you remain true to me, and believe in my innocence, I am safe-yes, safe from every harm. I'd laugh them all to scorn. But if you should begin to doubt me, Nellie-NELLIE, now listen to me-if you should begin to doubt me, may God have mercy on my soul!" 
                  "Reuben, you frighten me! Tell me what it is, or-" 
                  The door opened, and Mr. Montgomery told Reuben that some one was waiting for him outside. A moment afterward he was at the door. 
                  "Do you want to see me?" he said to a boy who stood on the steps. 
                  "Is your name Mr. Armhold?" 
                  "Yes,." 
                  "Here is a note for you." 
                  He opened it, and, while his cheeks turned whiter, read: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 Mr. Armhold:
                               
                              I have just arrived with your child in this city, and am stopping at the Delbanco House. Come and see me at once, or in less than an hour I shall have you arrested. 
                              
                                 CARRIE HARRINGTON.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                
                
                  CHAPTER XVII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Murder most foul, as in the best it is; 
                              But this most foul, strange, and unnatural. 
                           
                         
                        HAMLET. 
                      
                   
                  IN one of the most extravagantly furnished rooms of the Delbanco House, fully lighted, and having a coal-fire crackling in the grate, a lady is languidly lying on a soft, downy couch. By her side, wrapped up in a warm blanket, nestles a child scarcely a fortnight old. The little thing cries lustily, as if in pain or hunger, but the mother is deaf to its appeal, and withholds from it the nipple of her breast. She is lost in deep reflection, and the bright lights of the burnished chandeliers exhibit a face as white as the snow-flake sailing in the untainted sky-a face no less beautiful than it is white. Her soft blue eyes are vaguely gazing far beyond the walls-far, far into the distance-far, far beyond the limits of all matter-vaguely gazing into the sphere of thought, where the past, the present, and the future slowly and grimly loom up, like giants of darkness, benumbing her half-bewildered senses. Her lips are thin and white, and her cheeks, so very wan, partake of that quiet and calmness which the angel of Peace lends the dying sinner, in whose heart no single hope nor fear can rouse any longer the passions from the green pool of dormancy. Her long, soft hair is neither red nor brown, but of that auburn which steals its hue from the day-god's parting blush, and its gloss from the silver lake on which the sunbeam rests. It falls in long streamlets of gold over her naked shoulders, slowly rising and falling with the faint breath that quickens the matronly breast swelling beneath the loose folds of white mull. Something divine rests upon her features; Nature sanctifies the mother with an ethereal beauty, and lends her a charm beside which all others pale. 
                  A gentle tap at the door. She hears it, and at once shrinks within herself. A little color flies to her cheeks as she raises herself up in the bed. The boy we have seen at Montgomery's, handing Reuben the note, noiselessly enters and informs the lady that the gentleman had promised to be here shortly. She does not hear any thing else; she falls back upon her pillow, and for a moment closes her eyes. The boy noiselessly steals from the room, and leaves the lady to herself. 
                  The child is still crying; the mother seems to hear it now. She places it closer to her breast, and puts the nipple in its little mouth. It begins to suckle and feel content. Nothing is heard save the crackling of the coal, and now and then a long-drawn sigh which escapes the lady's breast. She is no longer lost in a reverie, for her lips move slowly, and inaudibly articulate words, until her eyes turn toward the little head which lies upon her bosom, when gradually her features lose their tender expression which maternity had lent them, and turn cold and stiff. 
                  The light which exhibits the face of the lady, falls with the same force and splendor upon the little thing by her side. But O, what a difference their looks present! How beautiful the mother!-how terribly ugly and nature-defying her offspring! It has not the face of a human being, for a coarse, reddish hair covers both the rear and front of its head, which is in the shape, and has the mouth and nose of a hare. Its hands are no hands, and its feet are no feet. It has nothing of the human being, save the eyes, which were like those of its mother, and the upper part of its body, which was fair, fat, and translucently pure. 
                  That thing, more beast than human, is still at her breast. One more look at this abortion, and she turns away from it with disgust. Her eyes assume a different expression; something wild, something unearthly is in their glance, and her lips once more move as if articulating inaudible words. 
                  Hasty steps are heard in the hall, and a moment later the door is hurriedly thrown open, and, before the invalid has time to erect herself, Reuben Armhold, with flushed cheeks and angry looks, stands before Carrie Harrington's couch. 
                  "What do you want?" he exclaimed, in a tone that could not be mistaken. But Carrie was unsexed and grown reckless, and imagined to possess the right-she did not reason why-of demanding, aye, of dictating terms to him. 
                  "What do I want?" she shrilly answered in return; "what do I want? I want to have revenge on you!" 
                  "God Almighty!" he shrieked in despair, hurrying up and down the room, and forcing his fingers through his hair. "Wants to have revenge on me-on me! Say, what in the world have I ever done wrong to you, that you should be bent upon ruining me? Wants to have revenge! Carrie, are you mad? Say, are you demented?-or what the devil has come over you?" 
                  "Why didn't you come to me when I wrote to you to come? Did you think I should never more return? But you see I am here, and I intend staying here." 
                  "Woman, I have a great mind to kill you!" 
                  "I do not fear you; if I had done so"-and here a smile, faint as if it had come from the realm of death, passed over her pale lips-" I should have sent for some one to witness this interview. Tell me, why did you not come, as you had promised me? I should have spared you, but now-I won't. I expected the child would die. It did not die; and, as I had not the heart to kill it, I brought it to you." 
                  Reuben staggered, and his whole frame, heavy and well-knit as it was, trembled from head to foot. 
                  "You need not look, so confused," she continued, her voice growing somewhat fainter, for these little exertions had nearly exhausted her whole strength, "for you ought to have expected my return. I want you to take your child away-do you hear me? You see I am not strong; a mother of two weeks has no extra strength to waste." 
                  Reuben stopped in the middle of the room, and for some moments stared at the pale, determined face of the invalid; then his anger broke forth, and he said: 
                  "Go to the devil, woman! for I would sooner follow you there than throw any more words away on you here. Take the child away from you! Gods! Why don't you send for its father, and have him take care of it? Do you think, because I humored you while you were fretful and peevish, that I intend to continue so? No, Carrie, no! I understand your game. I am compromised in this affair too much already. I shall take good care to keep my skirts clear in the future." 
                  "Do you mean to say that you are not the father of my child?" she shrieked, her head bent forward, and her eyes shooting forth fiery glances. "Do you-" 
                  The rest of the sentence Reuben choked in her throat He had pressed the broad palm of his hand over her lips to drown her voice. 
                  "Say, what do you mean? Do you want to have the whole house up here?" 
                  "What do I care? I'd just as lief have all Cincinnati around me! And, then, you only humored me so long as you thought me fretful and peevish? And you do not intend to compromise yourself any further with me?-as if you had not compromised yourself enough already! Do you suppose for a moment that you can deny having taken me away from here, paid my boarding, and passed yourself off as my brother? Do you suppose it, for a moment?" 
                  "Woman!" and he threw himself upon a chair, wiping away the perspiration drops from his face, "what, in the name of God, do you want of me?" 
                  "I want you to marry me!" 
                  "Is that all?" 
                  "That is all!" 
                  "Well, I thought that I understood your game. If this is the reason why you have sent for me, you might have spared yourself the trouble; for, sooner than marry you, I would dash out my brains against this wall!" 
                  After a pause, she said: 
                  "Reuben, I love you-love you with a madness which controls my better self!" 
                  He laughed, full of bitterness. 
                  "No-don't laugh," she continued, "for I do love you! I have done all this to possess you! I knew I could not get you by fair means, so I employed foul ones. Forgive me, Reuben-and let me love you!" 
                  "And this is the reason why you are determined upon ruining me?" 
                  "I do not mean to ruin you." 
                  "Why, then, do you wish to taint my name?" 
                  "Reuben, marry me, and not a soul shall ever discover my shame." 
                  "Carrie, you do not know what you ask. If you ever believed for one moment that anything or anybody could bring me to marry you, you were more than mistaken in my character." 
                  "Am I then so ugly? I know I'm not, and feel that I could make you happy were you only to suffer it. 'Tis true that I can not offer you virgin purity, that I can not come to you stainless, but I should be to you-believe it, Reuben,-truer, better than any other woman living. For no one loves you better than I, and no one on earth would do more to make you happy. Tell me that you'll have me, and, if you but say so, I'll strangle this child, and no one on earth shall know of my shame. It is with you, Reuben, to open Paradise to me, or the lunatic asylum." 
                  There was something solemn in these words, and she evidently felt what she said. She threw herself back upon her pillow, and closed her eyes. She was still weak, and could not endure this prolonged excitement. There was too strong a tension upon her nerves. 
                  Reuben suffered her to lay quiet for some moments; only when she once more opened her eyes he commenced: 
                  "Carrie, if you remain in this house one day longer, everything will be exposed. Why did you come back and having come back, taken rooms in so public a hotel where some acquaintances might recognize you any moment? You must leave again tonight." 
                  "I'll do so-go wherever you will to please you," she replied. "But I can't travel on the cars-I'm too frail." 
                  "Then go on the boat a few miles down the river, and stay there until you have regained your former strength." 
                  "And the child?" 
                  "You leave with me." 
                  It was between eleven and twelve that night that Reuben Armhold might have been seen to leave the city on horseback, winding his way along the river bank until he came to a bend, when he took to the left, and was soon lost in a dark wood through the heavy foliage of which neither moon nor stars threw a single ray. For nearly an hour he plodded on in this manner, when all at once he stopped before a creek and alighted from his horse. Just then something like a stifled cry rose from under the large cloak he had thrown around him. It was the cry of a child, and that child was no other than the one intrusted to him by Carrie. 
                  Reuben had promised to take care of it when its mother relinquished it to him before her departure down the river. But what was he doing with it here, in the deep, dark woods, in the middle of the night, with no witness save heaven and his conscience? 
                  Hark! A shriek! A cry of agony, then a splash in the muddy water broke the stillness of the hour, and a moment later nothing more was heard save the clattering hoofs of the fast-flying steed, and an ominous shriek of some mischief-brooding owl, perched on the naked tree-top of its forest home.

                              To doubt 
                              Is worse than to have lost; And to despair, 
                              Is but to antedate those miseries 
                              That must fall on us. 
                           
                         
                        MASSINGER'S DUKE OF MILAN. 
                      
                   
                  ON the following morning, Carrie, scarcely strong enough to keep upon her feet, might have been seen to leave the mail-boat that had rounded to, and lay at the wharf of a small town situated half-way between Cincinnati and Louisville. She gave her trunk in charge of an expressman, while she herself slowly attempted to ascend the wharf. She soon found out that she could never reach the top of the hill for she began to totter before she had walked twenty steps. She summoned a coachman, and in less than fifteen minutes she alighted before a small country tavern, and was conducted into a comfortably-heated room, which the landlady said, she could occupy during her stay. Breakfast was sent up to her, but she tasted nothing save a cup of coffee and a small piece of light bread. By this time her trunk had arrived, and after making a hasty toilet, she doffed her traveling attire and donned herself in an easy morning-wrapper. This done, she seated herself on a chair by the window, and looked out upon the quiet, almost deserted little town, dreamily watching the few persons, who with that peculiar ease and slowness characteristic of our peaceful villagers, went to and fro. Twice she passed her hand across her brow as if to drive away some unpleasant thought; then she rose from her seat and made a slow round across the room. 
                  How quiet was all around her! Not even the noise a mouse could have made was heard either within the house or from without. Peace seemed to reign every where-every where except in her bosom-except in her mind. 
                  There was a small bed in one corner. She did not lay herself upon its invitingly snow-white cover, though she was almost overcome by weakness-she simply sat down upon it and looked upon the scant furniture, the few chairs, and small table, washstand and some other trifles that comprised its outfit, with that meaningless, dreamy glance we so often observe in the despairing wretch who has given up his struggles and has grown quite indifferent to what may become of him. 
                  Though her eyes were bent upon those objects, they saw them not. They were looking upon the mirror that now slowly unfolded itself before her mind, reflecting as if in a glass the life she had led within the last few months. One by one, slowly and in regular rotation, each scene she had enacted since she first had apprised Broadwell of her condition, passed before her eyes, and, though her heart sickened at the sight, they would come and go, come and go, and come and go again, until she closed those eyes, as if to expel them from within, and, after shrinking within herself, she threw herself upon the bed, and hiding her ghastly face under the pillow, remained in that languid position, until sleep came to her relief, and drove those ugly thoughts away. 
                  It was late in the evening when she awoke. She raised herself upon her pillow, and with a bewildered look glanced about her. A moment later she heaved a sad sigh, and nodded her head, as if to say, "I remember now where I am." A light tap at the door aroused her fully, and, as the landlady noiselessly opened the door and approached her bedside, she was sufficiently composed to greet her with a faint smile. 
                  "I have been asleep," she said slowly raising herself upon her elbow, "and almost forgot that it must be dinner-time. You have surely come to tell me of it. I thank you. I am not hungry in the least, but if you will oblige me with a glass of water, for I'm thirsty and my lips are parched-" 
                  Mrs. Walsh-it was the landlady's name-did not suffer her to complete the sentence. 
                  "Certainly," she said, "you shall have a glass of water if you desire it, but I should be more pleased if you would allow me to bring you something more substantial. It is not noon now-it is almost sunset, and you have tasted nothing since you have had your breakfast, which consisted only of a cup of coffee and a small piece of bread. Come, Miss Harrington-I believe that's your name-let me send you a small piece of steak, some coffee and toast, and I think one or two boiled potatoes would not hurt you." 
                  When supper was brought up, Carrie discovered that she had a far greater appetite than she had had for weeks, and consequently partook freely of the savory dishes Mrs. Walsh herself had placed before her. 
                  "Well, I believe I have done justice to the meal," she said at last, then once more threw herself upon her pillow. 
                  "Do you wish any thing else?" the hostess inquired, taking away the remainder of the meal. 
                  "No, I thank you. If I should need any thing else, I shall ring the bell." 
                  "Do so." 
                  Once more Carrie was alone. She rose from her bed, slowly crossed the room, and then stationed herself before the window. Every thing was quiet and peaceful as it had appeared to her at her first entrance in the little town that morning. But then the heaven had been blue and clear, now it was of a leaden hue, and from the chimneys of the peaceful cottagers' homes many a smoke-cloudlet drifted through the hazy air. It grew darker and darker, the somber shades of evening slowly passed behind the gloomy pall of night, and still Carrie stood by that window-stood there like a pale specter risen from the tomb-stood there blankly, dreamily gazing into the dark, limitless space through which the wind like demons at their midnight orgies, kept up a moaning and a howling, that, while it made the honest villagers feel sad and gloomy in their snug and well-closed rooms, threw a light into Carrie's soul and lifted from it some of that heavy weight that was resting upon it. 
                  She heaved a long sigh, and her taper fingers made quaint marks upon the window-panes. She looked at what they had accomplished for a moment, then, with one sweep, wiped them off again. 
                  How still and noiseless all within the house! Not a mouse seemed to stir itself. She turned away her eyes from the dark, gloomy outside, and for a moment looked about her room. It was just as dark, if not darker than the street. She could not see a hand before her; but she did not light a candle, though she knew that Mrs. Walsh had placed one upon the small table beside her bed. She loved solitude and night-it corresponded with her feelings-and only wished that the same darkness might enter her inner self, blot out her thoughts, and bury them in eternal oblivion. 
                  She grew tired from standing, so she seated herself upon the chair by the window, and, supporting her head upon her elbow, still looked out into the dark, limitless space. Now small snow-flakes began to fall and drift against the panes, to show their fleecy gown for a moment, and then disappear. It had begun to snow, and gradually the flakes fell thicker and heavier, laying a white coat on the ground and on the roofs of the villagers' houses. Now and then a gust of wind would sweep the fallen flakes from place to place, baring the ground here, and heaping up a mountain there; but ere the clock had struck twelve, the wind had ceased to blow with violence, and Carrie still sat by the window, still watched the large silver flakes as they earthward sped. It struck one, it struck two, and still she had not yet retired; but now a cold chill crept through her frame, and she rose from her seat, and threw herself upon her bed without disrobing. Five minutes later she was asleep, fast asleep-happier by far than she had been, aye, for years, for she was unconscious of her existence-of her misery. 
                  She did not awake until it was almost nine in the morning. When she opened her eyes she discovered that some one had been in her room already, for a warm wood-fire was cheerily crackling in the hearth. It took her but a short time to rise and make her toilet. This done she rang the bell. A little, rosy-cheeked girl, after inquiring whether she might come in, entered and asked what the lady wanted. 
                  "I want you to bring me my breakfast up into my room," Carrie said, "and after today I shall not trouble you with doing so again." 
                  "O, that's no trouble," the girl replied, smiling. "I don't mind that. What do you wish to have for breakfast? Roast-beef? mutton-chop--" 
                  "O, no, I want no meats; bring me a cup of hot coffee, and-if you have any-some toast." 
                  "But you surely want something else; you know it is a long time to wait from breakfast to dinner. Will you not have one or two soft-boiled eggs?" 
                  "Well, perhaps I can eat an egg-bring me one, please." 
                  And Carrie did as much justice to her breakfast as she had done to her supper on the evening previous. Sad and heart broken as she was, she still had a hearty appetite. She drank her coffee, ate the toast, and left two empty egg-shells on her plate. 
                  After the remainder of the breakfast had been taken away, the girl requested Carrie to leave the room for a short time until it could be brought into good order. This she did; after throwing a heavy shawl over her shoulders, she betook herself to the street. But before she had gone two steps she went back into the house, for the snow lay seven inches deep on the ground. Once more she ascended the stairs and returned to her room. 
                  "Never mind," she said to the girl who was sweeping the floor. "I do not mind the dust. You can clean up the room though I am here." 
                  So saying, she seated herself close by the hearth and watched the yellow flames as they shot with a malicious delight from the heart of the red pine log they were embracing with their fiery arms. When she looked around some minutes after, the girl was gone and she was alone. Now she threw herself upon her bed again, for she had nothing to do, and if she had had she would still have been too weak to accomplish the least bodily labor. How many thoughts now crowded upon her mind! They just flashed upon her with the lightning's speed. She could not drive them away. She had to think and think and think, and still the thoughts were there like so many inquisitors that could not be removed-could not be satisfied. 
                  An involuntary cry escaped her lips just then-those thoughts-like old, lank bats-would sit down in the darkest nooks and brood and hatch the loathsome thing they were. "I can't rest," she said impatiently, then rose and supported herself upon her elbow. 
                   
                  A moment later she was up and rang the bell. It brought the servant-girl to her door. 
                  "Bring me some book or paper to read-will you, please?" And Carrie returned to seat herself on the bed. She had to wait nearly fifteen minutes before the girl appeared again. 
                  "Mrs. Walsh said," the servant's answer ran, "that there are no books and no papers in the house. But if you could wait a little while she would try to borrow you 'something to read' from the storekeeper who gets the Cincinnati papers once a week." 
                  "Then you have no books at all about the house?" 
                  "Mrs. Walsh said so." 
                  "Well, bring me the papers as soon as you obtain them." 
                  The girl put another log on the fire, then went out, and Carrie was once more left to her own thoughts. Now, as she sat there looking into the flames, she reviewed for the fiftieth time her past. Her past! Did any woman ever have such a past? What would ever become of her? Would ever her brother find out her disgrace? Would any body else ever find it out? Such, and a thousand other such questions she tormented herself with, without possessing the least ability of answering a single one satisfactorily to her own mind. What was Reuben thinking of her, she wondered. Was he planning how to revenge himself upon her, or was he willing to take her as his wife? 
                  A strange smile passed over her wan features for a second, and then passed away again, only to leave them sadder and darker than they had been. 
                  He would not marry her. He had only promised her every thing in order to get rid of her. Her child-- 
                  A pang-a bitter, bitter pang shot through her heart. It was the first thought she had bestowed upon her child since she had resigned it. 
                  For a moment she felt that she was a mother, and yearned for her offspring. She forgot that it was an abortion-that nature had deprived it of the shape and features of a human being-and only remembered that it was her child. Tears rushed to her eyes, and sob after sob escaped from her lips, as she accused herself of having robbed it of the care of its mother, while it should lie upon her breast, and draw life and nourishment therefrom. 
                  The thought grew upon her, and made her almost wild. She leaped from her bed, and ran up and down her room, crying, "My child! my child!" 
                  Doubts and fears that had slumbered until now, loomed up like dark monsters of the deep, and spread terror through her mind. She remembered, now, with what eagerness Reuben had taken the child; how his brow knitted and his eyes shone, as he lifted her into the carriage which had taken her to the boat, while he hastened off-hastened whither?-with the child she had given him. Now she remembered some of the dark words which had escaped him at their last interview, and she trembled from head to foot; and the fire that lurks in the cat's eye when robbed of her young, wrote terror in Carrie's wildly-rolling orbs of blue, giving to her distorted face the expression of a maniac. 
                  Again she rang the bell; it was a broken bell, and sent a harsh, grating sound through the house. In less than a minute Mrs. Walsh, Mr. Walsh, the children and servants rushed into her room. They thought the sick lady was dying, or that her room was on fire. But though neither the one nor the other, as they discovered at the first glance, was the case, they were by far more surprised when they saw the flushed cheeks and flashing eyes of the lady, whom they had supposed to be too weak to leave her bed, and who ran, like one demented, from one extremity of the room to the other. 
                  "What's the matter, in heaven's name?" exclaimed the frightened hostess, approaching Carrie, whose eyes were still wildly rolling in their sockets. 
                  "My child-my child! I want my child!" Carrie shrieked in despair, tearing herself loose and throwing herself upon her bed. 
                  "We have not your child," answered Mrs. Walsh. "Tell us where it is, and we will have it brought to you." 
                  Carrie did not answer, but kept on crying for nearly fifteen minutes; then she rose up, and found that all except her kind hostess had left the room. 
                  "Excuse me, Mrs. Walsh," she said, huskily, then dried her tears. "Let me beg you for a small piece of paper, and some ink, and a pen. I should like to write a letter." 
                  Mrs. Walsh hurried from the room, and soon afterward the little girl brought in the requested things. 
                  Now Carrie got up, and sat down by the table. A moment later her pen was flying fast across the sheet of paper that was lying before her. When done, she did not read over what she had written, but closed up the letter, and directed it: 
                        REUBEN ARMHOLD, "Cincinnati, Ohio."

                              If thou neglect'or or dost unwillingly 
                              What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps 
                              Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar. 
                              That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

                  LETTERS which passed between Carrie Harrington and Reuben Armhold:

                                 Reuben:
                               
                              What have you made me do? Where is my child? How is it? I can't rest. I am crazy. 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 CINCINNATI, February 16, 18-. 
                                 Miss Carrie:
                               
                              Your note has just come to hand, and I am more than astonished at its contents. You left me with the assurance that the child should be mine, and that you would never more ask for it. I only took it from you under these conditions. Now, scarcely gone twice twelve hours, you have the audacity to inquire of me what became of it. Do you really think you can play with me? Rest assured, the child is better taken care of than if you had it. Let this suffice you, for you shall hear nothing more of me. I trust you will not trouble me further with your correspondence. I gave you the money you requested. Whenever you are well enough, you can return to your home, and no one will suspect you. 
                              
                                 R. A.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 K--, February 17, 18-. 
                                 Reuben:
                               
                              I am not satisfied with your answer, and you must satisfy my mind. I am a mother, and have the right to inquire into the child's health. Granted that I have sold you my child-what of it? Tell me what you have done with it, and whether I may see it again. I can not sleep-I can not rest until I have heard from you. 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 CINCINNATI, February 19, 18-. 
                                 Carrie:
                               
                              This is the last letter I am going to write to you. I have told you the child is better taken care of than if you had it. This must satisfy you. I know you care nothing for the child; for what woman would not thank God, were she even a wife-which you are not-if she could get rid, even by death, of such an abortion? You have given it to me, and I do not intend that you shall ever discover its whereabouts. I see the devil must have entered your breast, else you would not be bent upon destroying both yourself and me. 
                              
                                 R. A.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 K--, February 21, 18-. 
                                 Mr. Armhold:
                               
                              I am crazy, and it is you who have made me so. Why do you keep my child's whereabouts from me? Do you think I am thus to be trifled with? I shall soon show you what a woman, frantic and crazed, can do! Expect me in Cincinnati to-morrow. You will talk differently then! 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                
                
                  CHAPTER XX. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              YET is there one more cursed than they all, 
                              That canker-worm, that monster jealousy, 
                              Which eats the heart and feeds upon the gall, 
                              Turning all love's delight to misery, 
                              Through fear of losing his felicity, 
                              Ah, Gods! that ever ye that monster placed 
                              In gentle love that all his joys defaced! 
                           
                         
                        SPENSER'S HYMN IN HONOR OF LOVE. 
                      
                   
                  THAT something had gone amiss-that some great sorrow was preying upon Reuben's mind-a single glance at his crest-fallen countenance would have told. Is it then to be wondered at that Nellie, who had the opportunity to see and be with him daily, had also taken notice of this sad change? The life he had exhibited even since the day of their betrothal, his happy good humor, his almost jollity, the particular interest he had commenced taking in her, all had vanished of late, and a strange reserve, an unusual shyness, was now perceptible in all his movements. He had avoided, as much as possible, not only the companionship of his friends, but even Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery had, on several occasions, inquired of him the cause that made him shun their society, and confine him so much to his own room. At such times he had simply smiled, which even they had noticed to be a forced one, and then said that he had not felt well of late, and therefore had not wished to throw a chill over them. As it is not an uncommon occurrence for persons who feel indisposed to shun all sorts of society, Reuben's answer had proved satisfactory to his kind host and hostess, but to their daughter-to Nellie-to the woman who had been watching him with the eyes of love, who had daily observed him grow sadder, more reserved, aye, and more perplexed and absent-minded, such an answer could not have been satisfactory. She had felt that no bodily ailment could have produced such a change in him, could have so terribly depressed the buoyancy of his spirit. And impressed with this idea, and somewhat piqued at his reticency and want of confidence, she had borne for several weeks his conduct without complaint or any outer show of displeasure, and in all probability might have kept up that show of indifference for some days to come, had not something-trifling as it may appear-aroused her to a consciousness of danger, and had lifted, to some extent, the mist from her eyes. 
                  It was on the 22d of February, the anniversary of Washington's birthday, between the hours of two and three, that the postman left a letter (it was the note Carrie had written a day previous, in which she informed Reuben of her intended departure for Cincinnati,) for Mr. Armhold at the house. A servant was just taking it up to his room when Nellie passed her in the hall. Not suspecting any thing, she simply asked: 
                  "For whom is that letter?" 
                  "It is for Mr. Armhold;" and the girl moved away and began to ascend a flight of stairs. But Nellie-no, Nellie did not move away. That little white billet had sent a sharp thrust into her heart, and blanched her cheeks. For a moment she remained silent, and watched the ascending figure of the servant. 
                  "Francis!" 
                  The girl turned, and inquiringly looked into her young mistress's face. 
                  "Do you want me?" 
                   
                  "Yes-come down." 
                  She came down. Nellie waited until she was close enough, then she said, rather in a low, hoarse voice: 
                  "Let me see this letter." 
                  Her curiosity was satisfied; she saw the inscription and recognized it. 
                  "You can go now." 
                  The servant ran up-stairs, and Nellie went into her own room. She was agitated beyond expression. Her whole frame shook, and she felt a faintness come over her. The past flashed back to her mind. She remembered the letter Reuben had received from Carrie Harrington some weeks since, in which she had requested an interview with him. She also remembered that from that period he had grown so perplexed and absent-minded. A terrible doubt arose in her mind. Now, for the first time she thought of Miss Harrington's hasty departure from the city, and connected this with Reuben's unaccountable behavior. She fancied to have found at last the key to the mystery, and, despite the pain she felt, she enjoyed the satisfaction of having emerged from the dark. She sat down by the fire-place, and moved her feet upon the fender, while she looked into the flames. Her fingers were nervously playing with the folds of her dress, and now and then they would close up-cramp-like-into a hard, stiff fist, as if by so doing she was bracing herself against some nervous attack that seemed to threaten her inner-peace. A few sighs escaped her, and a few tears might have been seen in her eyes as she reflected over her situation, and what her course of conduct should be to Reuben in the future. Now she thought of doing this, and now of that, and lastly she resolved at doing neither the one nor the other, but-but what? 
                  The longer she reflected, the greater her perplexity. She got angry at herself. Throwing the poker, with which she had been unnecessarily stirring up the fire for the last few minutes, on the fender, she rose unceremoniously from her seat, upsetting the chair, then, perceptibly agitated, paced hurriedly, for some time, from one end of the room to the other. Alternately she would stop before the window overlooking the street, now covered over with a thick layer of snow that had fallen during the previous night and morning, and now considerably impeding the progress of the pedestrians. Having passed something like an hour in this manner, she retraced her steps, passed through the door, and made her way to Reuben's own apartment. She had resolved to speak to him, and speak to him she would, and that too, at once. 
                  She went in without knocking. Reuben was seated by a small deal-table, seemingly abstracted, so much so, in fact, that he did not observe his intended's entrance, until her voice, which was unnaturally cold and harsh, aroused him from his reverie, and made him turn his eyes upon her. 
                  She did not give him time to recover from his suprise; she commenced to address him before she had scarcely arranged her own scattered thoughts. Without taking a seat, or even moving away from the door, and with her eyes now widely dilated and fully bent upon him, she said, rather abruptly: 
                  "Mr. Armhold, I have come up to find out the cause of this, to me, inexplicable conduct of yours. I have observed that, from the hour you received Miss Harrington's note some three or four weeks since, you have grown so reserved and sullen, that those who had known you then, would scarcely recognize, in this dejected, absent-minded person, the same man now. I have refrained from broaching this subject, continually thinking that the duty you owe to me would open your lips to dispel the mist this mystery has thrown over my mind. I have lived long enough in darkness-I think it about time that you should speak." 
                  We feel confident that Nellie Montgomery never would have spoken in such a harsh tone to Reuben, had not jealousy, a feeling of wounded and insulted pride, aroused her anger, and for a moment cooled the love she fostered for him in her bosom. Yet she had scarcely finished the last sentence, and even while her dilated eyes were still coldly scanning his features, she repented of her bitterness, and a blush of shame came to her temples as Reuben rose from his chair, approached to where she stood, and, gently taking hold of her by the hand, led her to a seat, saying: 
                  "Nellie, you once said that you loved me. I believed it, Nellie-I believe it still. Now, in the name of that love, for the present do not urge me to assign a reason for this despondency of mine. I am in trouble-in a great, great trouble. I can not speak to you of it-at least not now-not if you were to fall upon your knees and plead to me with uplifted hands. I know my conduct must excite astonishment, but I can not help it. I shall soon-at least I trust I shall-be able to look smilingly into your face, and say to you, 'the storm is passed.'" 
                  "Am I not entitled to your confidence," Nellie replied, her suspicion of his infidelity by no means allayed by his appeal, "that you should persist in remaining silent? What am I to think of your conduct, sir, if you fear to confide in me? If a misfortune has befallen you, who but I should know it first, and who would sympathize with you more truly than I?" And then bracing herself up: "But I don't believe that any misfortune has befallen you-no, I don't; if it were simply a misfortune you would not be so reticent, and hang your head more like a criminal-" 
                  At that word he turned as white as a linen sheet, and a nervous twitching distorted his 
                      
                        "DON'T I LOOK VERY, VERY UGLY?" 
                     
                     
                      features. Turning his dark, raven eyes down upon her, his lips grew lurid, and a strange luster lighted up his pupils, as he said, in a voice that made her shrink within herself: "Stop! for God's sake stop, if you do not wish to drive me mad; for to hear you, Nellie, you, speak thus to me, will make me reckless, and then"-and here his voice mellowed down, and grew low and sad-"and then it will be done with Reuben Armhold." 
                  He nodded his head and slowly moved away to the other side of the room, and threw himself lengthways upon a settee. Just then a heavy sigh escaped his lips; it was followed by another and another, and in less than a minute he was once more upon his feet, hastily crossing the room, and, stopping a pace or two in front of Nellie, said: 
                  "Nellie, do you love me?" 
                  There was no longer any sadness in his voice. It was stern, but not harsh, and it fell upon her ears with the same chill its sound had produced upon her when he had first been introduced to her. 
                  "Nellie do you love me?" 
                  "Why do you ask me this question? I should think the position we occupy to one another should have precluded even the possibility of the existence of a doubt. If I had not loved you I should not have become your betrothed." 
                  "You are right, Nellie, and I believe you. I have never doubted for a moment the sincerity of your affection. And were it not for the great love I bear you, my Nellie"-this with considerable warmth-"I should not feel so depressed in spirit as I do now. It is only on your account that I suffer-to save you from shame that I restrain myself from doing violence, and so put an end to all the troubles at once." 
                  "I do not understand you, Mr. Armhold." 
                  "It tears my heart almost to pieces that I can not explain myself to you more plainly. Be satisfied for a few days more, and you shall know all." 
                  "Why in a few days, and not now, Mr. Armhold?" 
                  "Nellie, do not call me Mr. Armhold; I can not endure your coldness. You can scarcely know what I have suffered the last few weeks in order to spare you. Trust me, and all will yet be well." 
                  "Trust you! And who said that I did not trust you? Who can tell whether I have not trusted you too much and too long already? You ask me to wait a few days, and you will tell me all. I do not doubt that. But if I have the right to hear it then, why not now?" 
                  "O, Nellie, Nellie, do not torture me!" 
                  Miss Montgomery grew still angrier at this persistency. The blood rushed crimson to her cheeks, and her eyes flashed fire. 
                  "I tell you that you torture me!" she shrieked, with suppressed rage. 
                  "You do not love me, Nellie, else you would not urge me thus." 
                  "Are you not implicated in some way or other with Carrie Harrington?" 
                  He blanched-felt as if transfixed to the floor. 
                  "You do not answer me," she added, fancying she had struck home; "because you can not. What's up between you?" 
                  "Nellie, do not press me closer. I have told you that you shall hear all in a few days." 
                  And then he knelt down before her, and in a deep voice, tremulous with emotion, and with a face in which the agony of his soul was depicted, added: 
                  "Wrong has been done unto me, Nellie, and it breaks my heart to think of it. To tell you of it now would, I fear, lose me your love. O, Nellie, Nellie! you know not how deeply I have been humiliating myself in order to preserve your love for me! I can no longer exist without it. I do not speak like a boy; I feel it-I know it. From the hour when you promised to be mine, I have become another man. I left off all my evil ways, repented of all the wrong I had consciously and unconsciously done, and strove to become more worthy of thee. I have lived since then in a paradise in which presided but one God, and that God I saw in thee. Nellie, Nellie, do not banish me from that heaven!" here his voice grew hoarse. "I have suffered already so much-O, so much-that I could not endure more!" He lowered his head, and began to sob aloud. 
                  Nellie saw it, and felt a kind of remorse. That he was in great trouble she no longer doubted; that he loved her was equally as plain to her. But why should he not confide in her, if he be not guilty of some wrong? Why should he wish to postpone setting her at ease? Had she no feelings? Was it right in him to treat her thus? 
                  "You had a letter brought to you some moments since," she commenced, abruptly. "I recognized the handwriting; it is Miss Harrington's. I want to read that letter, and I shall not ask another question." 
                  He looked up, and his old expression-the expression he had worn while serving at Sing-Sing-darkened for a moment his wan face. 
                  "And if I show you that letter, Nellie, and let you read it, will you still think me true and faithful to you, notwithstanding the doubt that may steal into your mind?" 
                  "I can not promise you that; but to withhold that letter from me now, will not be likely to strengthen my faith in you." 
                  He rose from his kneeling position, and moved to his bureau. A moment later he returned with the letter in his hand. He did not offer it to her at once, but, stationing himself before her, said: 
                  "Let me once more entreat you to desist. 
                   
                  To know the contents of this note would simply ruin me, and make you miserable." 
                  "Let me have it." 
                  He gave it to her. In that moment the blood in his veins congealed, and made him proof against any weakness. She read (what the reader has read before) the following lines: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 Mr. Armhold:
                               
                              I am crazy, and it is you who have made me so. Why do you keep my child's whereabouts from me? Do you think I am thus to be trifled with? I shall soon show you what a woman, frantic and crazed, can do! Expect me in Cincinnati to-morrow. You will talk differently then! 
                              
                                 CARRIE.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  After having given her ample time to peruse it, though her eyes were still lowered upon that sheet, he said: 
                  "Have you lost your faith in me?" 
                  She looked up, and never before had he seen a face more ghastly; but she was quite calm, apparently, as she replied: 
                  "Mr. Armhold, I did not expect anything better of you. I only pity the lady you have thus shamefully betrayed. I need not tell you that our engagement is now at an end. Nothing but the most barefaced audacity can prompt you to say aught in extenuation of your crime. We have done with one another forever!" 
                  Nellie must have steeled her heart to have said this. She rose from her seat, coldly laid Carrie's note back upon the small deal table, and then, with a step dignified as that of a queen, walked across the room. 
                  Reuben had listened to her with his characteristic calmness; saw her lay down the letter upon the table, watched her cross the room, and said not a word. But ere she had time to gain the door, he was there, obstructing her further progress. 
                  "Nellie!-" 
                  He took her hand in his, and held it fast She nerved herself to break loose from that grasp, but she felt it to be a grip of iron. 
                  "You can not escape me," he uttered, hurriedly; "you must hear me before you go. Nellie, I am innocent; as there is a God in heaven, I am innocent! Hear me-listen to me-" 
                  "If you do not release my hand at once, I shall call upon those to help me who can make you remember your position." 
                  He fell upon his knees and kissed that hand. "Nellie, Nellie!" he shrieked, in an agonized voice, "hear me but one moment! I want to explain all to you-all, all, so you will not drive me forth!" 
                  Her face grew still whiter. 
                  "Will you release me?" she requested for the second time. 
                  "O, Nellie! do not spurn me from you! 
                  "Pa!" 
                  It was heard in that room; it was heard in the passage; it was heard in the hall below; it was heard even in the street without; but loud as it was, it fell upon Reuben's ear like the dead, dull sound of a spent cannon-ball. 
                  He rose from his kneeling posture, and, raising himself up to his full night, looked for a second upon that cold, calm face by his side; then, releasing her ice-cold hand, he said: 
                  "Pardon me, Miss Nellie, for having believed you to belong to my mother's sex!" 
                  So saying, he picked up his hat, gave a cold, formal bow, and left the apartment he was destined never more to see. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              She looked on many a face with vacant eye, 
                              On many a token without knowing what; 
                              She saw them watch her without asking why, 
                              And recked not who around her pillow sate; 
                              Not speechless, though she spoke not; not a sigh 
                              Relieved her thoughts; dull silence and quick chat 
                              Were tried in vain by those who served; she gave 
                              No sign, save breath, of having left the grave. 
                           
                         
                        BYRON 
                      
                   
                  THE fear that had come over Broadwell was of short duration. No sooner had Carrie left the city in company with Reuben Armhold, than his spirit had risen, and he had followed again in the same track that had led him, as it had done thousands before him, to utter ruin and destruction. Gambling and drinking, gambling and drinking, and gambling and drinking had become once more his regular occupation for filling up the hours of both night and day. For a day or two, it is true, after he had promised to cancel the past-to reform and commence a new life-he had come home regularly to his meals, had even brought some little money along, and had revived in Hannah's heart the hope that her husband had really changed his mode of life, and was on the unfrequented and much-deserted road that leads to redemption. But she had been sorely disappointed. He had grown worse and worse of late, and Hannah's life became daily more miserable. 
                  Broadwell scarcely ever came home now; and when he did so, he was generally in such a condition that it had been far better for his wife and children if he had remained away entirely. Brutishly intoxicated, with oaths and curses falling from his lips, he would greet his family; eat up the little provisions that Hannah had purchased for her young ones with the little money she had earned by sewing garments-for she was doing that now in order to keep her children from starving-for her neighbors. Then he would leave once more, and in all probability not show his face again for days. 
                  Poor Hannah! Dearly had she paid for her error! Not a moment in these long, weary days, as she sat there deftly plying the needle, but that she thought of Edgar-her Edgar. How many thousand tears she shed in solitude and silence, none but herself ever knew! Remorse at the wrong she had done him gnawed on her heart, and banished forever her peace of mind. She was no longer proud; O, God, no! Pride had long since died out, never to be resurrected again in her bosom. She was humbled to the dust-crushed to the very earth. There was no longer any strong passion, save that of love to her children, dominant in her heart. She was simply a frail, weak, sickly woman, beyond all the vanities and hopes of this world. There was no longer a light in her soul, and no smile upon her cheeks, save now and then, when some of her little ones would be by her side, happy and laughing, unconscious of the misery of their mother, munching the bread she had given them with as much relish as if it had been the finest pastry. "Give me strength, O God!" she would at such times whisper to herself, "to bear up under my great affliction, so I can always feed these little mouths. I can not recall the wrong done in the past, but I can work for my children; I can watch over my little Emil, and my Edgar in heaven will look into my contrite heart, and intercede for me before the throne of God!" 
                  We don't know how it is-this prayer, so fervently, so sincerely offered up-as is often the case, and with the selfsame result-seemed not to have been heard by that all-merciful Spirit which, we are taught, delights not in the misery of the human race. The work which Hannah had received from her neighbors at last gave out, and though she walked from house to house, and from store to store, wherever she went she met with the poorest success. And so her poverty became greater still. Until now she had never informed her brother of her extreme destitution; she would do so at once, and ask him for assistance. O, how the tears rolled down her cheeks as she briefly recapitulated to Newton Preston some of her grievances! She sealed the letter and sent it off. An answer came in due time. He deplored deeply his sister's misfortunes, and would do all in his power to help her. He hoped to see her in the spring-some time in May-as he was then coming out West, and then he would do what he could for her. 
                  He would come in May, and now it was only February! What should she do in the mean time? Starve? 
                  Hannah read the letter, then laid it coolly aside, and began to hide herself away from her children, to weep, for her heart was-O, so heavy! 
                  But weeping did not bring any bread into the house; she had to be up and stirring. She went to her neighbors and told them that she was taking in washing. They promised to give her some work, and she went home happy. It was a great misfortune that she had never learned to wash in her youth-how could her mother ever have supposed that it would become the last resource of her daughter? 
                  Hannah's washing did not please her neighbors, and, after having experienced the mortification of being abused and insulted by them, she was also deprived of their custom. 
                  Now she stood in the world lost indeed. Sickly, and without any employment by which to support her family, she stood upon the verge of despair. She went home, went into her little cold room, threw herself upon her knees, and once more lifted her voice in prayer. Tears stood in her eyes, and sob after sob fell from her lips. She felt somewhat strengthened in spirit, for she communed with her God. 
                  It was cold, and her children were in the kitchen, which was heated just enough to make the temperature endurable. She left her own room, and went to that of the children. She called Emil to her side, and told him to take care of the house during her absence; she would be back soon, and bring them something to eat. 
                  Little Emil, even paler now than he had been, and far more frail, promised to do his mother's bidding, then watched her as she left the house and hurried down the snow-covered street until she was out of sight. 
                  Many were the squares that Hannah passed through that evening, and many were the houses she visited on that occasion. She had made up her mind to get succor from some one; and as she had prayed to her God, the idea had struck her that his ministers would surely relieve her of her misery. 
                  O, deluded, deluded woman! She had become, during Broadwell's good standing, acquainted with many of the clergy, and she now had gone to them and had told them-O, with how many tears-of her great destitution. 
                  Sweet words, spiritual consolation, sympathy, and what not-except real, substantial help-had been offered to her in abundance. 
                  Now, all hope extinguished in her bosom, and like one blinded, she groped her way homeward. Now and then she would speak to herself, and people who were passing her stared at her in astonishment, and moved on with the impression that they had beheld a crazy woman. 
                  It was dark when she reached the entrance that led to her abode. With an abstracted air she was about to rush in, when she was accosted by a boy who was confronting her. 
                  "Does Mr. Broadwell live here?" 
                  The mention of that name arrested her scattered thoughts for a moment. 
                  "Yes; what do you want with him?" 
                  "I want to see him." 
                  "He is not in just now. What do you want to see him for?" 
                   
                  "I have a letter for him." 
                  "A letter for him? Hand it to me; I will give it to him as soon as he returns." 
                  "No; the lady told me to give it only into his hands." 
                  "I am his wife." 
                  The boy did not know what to do; but after a moment's reflection he came to the conclusion that it could not be of much consequence whether he or Mrs. Broadwell delivered it, so he simply said: 
                  "I reckon I may as well hand it to you." 
                  Hannah hurried up stairs, stole noiselessly, so her children should not hear it, into her own room, lighted a candle, and with a trembling hand opened the letter and read, while her cheeks turned ashen: 
                  
                      
                         
                            
                              
                                 DELBANCO HOUSE, Feb. 22, 18-. 
                                 Broadwell:
                               
                              I have just arrived in search of my child. Come and see me at once, and prevent me from enacting a tragedy which would electrify the whole city. 
                              
                                 CARRIE HARRINGTON.
                               
                            
                         
                     
                   
                  Hannah dropped the letter from her hand, and when, a few minutes later, a tall stranger opened the door, he found Mrs. Hannah Broadwell lying unconscious on the hard, cold floor. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Away, and mock the time with fairest show: 
                              False face must hide what the false heart doth know. 
                           
                         
                        SHAKSPEARE'S MACBETH. 
                      
                   
                  No sooner had Reuben Armhold gained the street than he became once more a changed being. Thoughts of the sufferings he had endured, ever since his flight from the home of his parents up to the present moment, passed through his mind and steeled his heart. He was once more the enemy of his race. Faith, love, and friendship-a bitter, satanic smile lighted up his stony features as he thought of them-had died in his bosom within the last fifteen minutes. He had but one feeling left, and that was hate. Yes, he hated the world with all his heart and soul. Why should he not? What joys and pleasures had ever been his, that he should regard his fellow-men in any other light than in that of selfish, heartless tyrants? Had not his father also suffered?-his mother?-his brother? 
                  Enough! He moved away from Mr. Montgomery's house without a feeling of regret. He buttoned his coat to his chin, and stuck his hands in his pockets. People, many of whom he knew, he passed but did not notice. He felt a kind of resentment toward one and all for the many wrongs he had had to endure. A kind of freezing process seemed to go on within him, congealing his blood, and with it all the finer and better feelings of his nature. "A man is a fool," he thought, "who gives way to grief. Let him expect nothing good from the world, and be as selfish as the rest, and he can never be disappointed. Let him trust no one, believe in nothing, wear a false face to hide the falser heart; let him turn every thing and every body to his own advantage, smile where a smile will pay, laugh where a laugh will be appreciated, bow here, bow there, express sympathy with this one, and join slandering with the other; yes, let him do all this, and he will enjoy existence. I'll do it!" 
                  
                     He would do it! Scarcely had that thought passed through his mind before a chill crept through his frame. He would do it! How could he? Was he not a man-a man with a heart, though it was congealed now, who could never wear the guise of baseness? 
                  No! He hated the world, and could have seen, almost with a heartfelt luxury, the whole human family consumed in one vast conflagration. No! he could no longer enjoy his existence; and if even Nellie had once more let him live in the sunshine of her eyes, his blood would have remained frozen in his veins. He had closed his heart against all gentler influences, and now passed along the street a being forever estranged from his kind. 
                  The expression of his face corresponded well with his feelings. The color had left his cheeks, making his eyebrows look blacker and the wrinkles on his forehead more conspicuous. His teeth were firmly set, and his lips tightly compressed. Every thing looked hard, stiff, and cold as the glances which shot from his half-closed eyes. 
                  But that whole expression vanished, and a smile passed over his whole countenance, as, a moment later, he reached out his hand to Mr. Broadwell, whom accident just threw in his way. Yes, he was the man for the world; he was base enough for all purposes; he had no conscientious scruples; he was villain enough not only to lie and steal, but to rob and murder; and Reuben could almost have hugged him to his bosom for the baseness of his nature. He did not think of Sing-Sing just now; he only thought of having met with a man who had warred against, and inflicted wounds upon, society, and-he loved him for it. 
                  "How do you do, Broadwell?" he said, as the other came near enough to shake his proffered hand. "I have not seen you for several days. Where do you keep yourself now? Still visit the club-room?" And, as he looked at the ex-minister's wasted figure and seedy clothes, he added: "You seem to have had a long streak of bad luck. By George, Broadwell," and he took him by the arm. "I'd steal or murder rather than lead the life you do!" 
                  Broad well did not know what to make of this. Such language sounded so strangely from Reuben Armhold, who now continued, leading the other along: 
                  "Yes, I'd steal or murder, rather than lead the life you do! What use is there for you, me, or any one to be honest? I'm sure that you have no particular cause to love the world for the good it has vouchsafed you. Where were you going?" 
                  "I was going to get my dinner." 
                  "Well, then, you come along with me. I am just in the mood to get on a spree. Let's go across the canal, get a room for ourselves, and do just as we please." 
                  They now turned to the right, crossed the canal on Vine-street, and soon were lost among their Teutonic fellow-citizens. Never before had Reuben Armhold spoken with that freedom to Broadwell, who was not slow in discovering the change in his companion's present behavior. That something had turned up with Reuben, and something very unpleasant too, was apparent. No slight occurrence would have made him lose his dignity so much as to propose to "go on a spree" with him. That this change arose about something in connection with the affair of Carrie's, Broadwell did not doubt for a moment. 
                  "Let's go in here," said Reuben, and he drew the other along with him into a restaurant. They took seats by the stove, and waited for some one to attend to them. A red-cheeked lad soon came along to inquire of them with what they could be served. 
                  "First of all, we want a room to ourselves," said Reuben; but Broadwell interposed, saying that, as he could stay but for a few minutes, it would hardly be necessary to go to that trouble. So they agreed to remain in the room below, Reuben calling for a bottle of wine, and requesting Broadwell to order such things as he wanted. 
                  Hungry as Hannah's husband was-for he had not yet tasted any thing that day-he could eat but little. That the danger from which he had thought himself escaped was not yet over, and by all appearances-for he was sure that a misunderstanding, if not something worse, had happened between Carrie and Reuben-was more threatening now than ever, he felt certain. He had not heard from Miss Harrington since she notified him, on the first of February, of her child's birth, and her intention of shortly after returning to Cincinnati; and now it was the twenty-second. He felt sure that the storm had burst over Reuben's head, and in all likelihood, having driven him to despair, he had grown too reckless or indifferent to shelter himself from its wrath. 
                  What if the truth should still come out? 
                  He shuddered, and the knife and fork he held in his hand trembled. He could not eat another bite. He raised the glass to his lips to taste the wine, but it almost choked him. The coward spirit pervaded his whole being. He fancied himself already in Reuben's grasp. 
                  "Let's drink out, Armhold, and go," he said, taking courage to look his companion in the face. 
                  "Why do you want to go so soon?" replied Reuben, who had imbibed rather freely of the intoxicating beverage. 
                  "I have some business to attend to, else I should stay with you an hour or two longer, or even into the night. But perhaps you are ready to go along with me? If so, I shall be happy to have your company as far as our ways lie in one direction." 
                  Reuben leant back in his chair, and startled his companion with an ironic laugh. "My way," he said, "leads direct to the devil; and as I am not quite ready to start, I must say good-by to you, and let you go." 
                  Another laugh-it sounded so unnatural to Broadwell-and then he raised his eyes in the direction of the ceiling, and grew silent. Not another word escaped his lips. Now and then he would empty a glass of wine, until at last his head became too heavy, and he lowered it upon the table and fell asleep. 
                  "Armhold!" 
                  Reuben did not answer, and Broadwell rose from his seat, went up to the barkeeper, told him to take care of his friend for a few minutes, and then retired from the room. 
                  Being once more upon the street, and no one to disturb him, he walked slowly back into the city, and began to think coolly over the situation. That he himself was in imminent danger-a danger that might at any moment culminate in the loss of his life-was a fact he was unable to reason away. The security in which he had fancied to have placed himself in having complicated Reuben at once disappeared, and he found himself deeper in the mire than at first. 
                  Yet, what if Carrie, having failed with Reuben, should at once expose her betrayer? What would be the result? 
                  He shook. 
                  He thought of her-of Reuben-Hannah-Lionel; and felt his puny soul grow faint within him. He walked on, deeply lost in thought. Gradually he seemed to see his way clearer. He had looked at the situation from all sides, and resolved to stake all on one game. 
                  He breathed easier, for his mind was made up. What if it is crime, blacker than murder itself, upon which his thoughts are bent? Was it not for the purpose of saving himself-of rescuing his life? 
                  He walked on with the determination of playing his cards well. He was no longer the muddle-brained drunkard; he was as sober and clear-sighted as the wiliest of the wily. He had marked out his game, and he would hunt it down. 
                  It was already growing dark when he reached the club-room. He was not disappointed in finding Lionel there. The latter had been principally making his home there since his sister's departure. 
                  Broadwell found him talking to some lounger. He went up to him and bade him good-evening, and then sat down by their side, but did not join in their conversation. 
                  "What's up with you," Lionel said, after a short time, "that you keep so quiet?" 
                  "With me?" replied Broadwell, as if aroused from some deep reverie. "Nothing, I'm sure. Why?" 
                  "I don't know. You look as though you had had nothing to eat for a week." 
                  "Do I?" and he again relapsed into silence. 
                  Mr. Harrington once more turned to the lounger, and for some time after they kept up a lively conversation; but at last, as time wore on, both gave signs of weariness, which resulted, as it generally does, in the breaking up of their tete-a-tete. The lounger rose from his seat, lighted his cigar, then slowly dragged his lazy weight away. Mr. Harrington also lighted his cigar, and after placing it between his lips, instead of following the lounger out-doors, turned toward Mr. Broadwell, who affected to be in a deep brown study, and not aware of the attention of his neighbor. 
                  "Broadwell!" 
                  The gentleman addressed slowly raised his head and looked inquiringly into the other's face, but said nothing. 
                  "Broadwell," continued Lionel, "you are in a devilish strange humor this evening. I expected to meet you here in the best of spirits, ready to play a game of draw, but with far better success than you have had of late. Nonsense, man!" as he saw him shake his head, "you mustn't give up entirely. There is no use to be down in the mouth. If you have no money-and your appearance indicates every thing but wealth-I'll loan you a stake. I have been down in the purse as low as you are now; but I'd have been ashamed to grieve over it so much as to hang my head, and almost kill myself over it. I have found out that there is nothing like keeping up one's spirits. Show once that you are whipped, and the whole world will help to keep you down. Do as I have always done: never throw down your cards; but the harder you are pressed, man, why, the more determined you must prove. You can't more than lose your game; why give it up before you must? Here," and he reached into his pocket, "take a cigar, and watch the smoke curl up. It has always done me a great deal of good; perhaps it will drive your blues away." 
                  He took a small piece of paper from his pocket, lighted it, and then handed it to Broadwell; but the latter once more shook his head and refused to smoke. 
                  "Why, don't you want to smoke?" inquired Lionel, still holding out the cigar. 
                  "No;" and he sighed. 
                  "What is the matter with you?" 
                  Now Broadwell raised his head, and looked his companion straight in the face. "I have something to tell you," he commenced, in a low voice, and after he had moved his chair closer up to Lionel's-"something that will astonish you." 
                  Here he stopped for a moment, as if unable to go on unmoved, and heaved another long sigh. 
                  Mr. Harrington could not account for this conduct, and sat there, his curiosity somewhat excited, patiently waiting for the other to proceed, which that other seemed not in the slightest hurry to do. 
                  So minutes after minutes passed by in perfect silence, when Lionel, not feeling inclined to wait all night, made a start to leave his chair. Broadwell no sooner noticed it than he laid his hand on the other's lap, saying: 
                  "Harrington, do not go away. I have come to speak to you this evening upon a very important matter. Just have a little patience with me, and I will tell you all." 
                  Lionel sat there bewildered. He opened his eyes wide to look at his companion, and wondered what this important matter he had to reveal could be. After a short pause, Broadwell continued: 
                  "Lionel, I have fallen so low that I can not count, among all the citizens of Cincinnati, a single friend. There is no need of telling you how I fell, from the highest position of honor, to what I am now. There is a reason for every thing, and there is a reason for this. Believe not that I should have sunk so low if sorrow had not driven me to despair. I am about to say good-by to this world! Nay, do not start, for I am serious; and before you are an hour older, I shall be a dead man!" 
                  Lionel opened wide his mouth, and slowly suffered the smoke to well out. After looking at the other for a moment, he said abruptly: "You're crazy," then placed the cigar between his lips again, and-smoked on. 
                  "No, I'm not crazy now," Broadwell replied, "but I have been. I wish to heaven I had died before I had seen my wife." 
                  Lionel grew more interested now. 
                  "Why do you wish you had died before you had seen your wife?" he asked. 
                  "Because then I should not have been the cause of having destroyed her whole happiness, and I would not be under the necessity of asking you to give me a decent burial." 
                  "Now, man," Lionel interrupted, somewhat indignant, "you talk nonsense again. Damn it, if you want to hang or drown yourself, why don't you do it? What's the use to tell me of it? Do you think if you are fool enough to want to take your life, I am going to keep you from it? No, indeed, not I," and he began to lean back upon his chair and rocked himself. 
                   
                  "O, Lionel, I never thought to hear such language from you." 
                  "No, nor I from you." 
                  "When I think that you are the whole cause of my unhappiness- 
                  "The whole cause of your unhappiness!" Lionel broke in, dropping the cigar from his lips. "What the devil do you mean?" 
                  "Don't talk that way to me, for I have no complaints to raise. I only know that I am the most miserable man on earth, and wish that I were dead." 
                  "Now, look here, Broadwell, I wish you to speak out. Damn it, I won't stand this. You said I was the whole cause of your unhappiness. I want to know what right you had to say so?" 
                  Broadwell took out his pocket handkerchief and passed it over his eyes, as if to wipe away some tears. Lionel saw it and softened down a little. 
                  "Tell me, what is the matter with you?" he continued, affecting some little sympathy for him. 
                  This time Broadwell came up to the mark. Looking the other straight in the eyes, he replied: 
                  "I have persuaded a woman to marry me whose heart never was mine. I only found out the error when it was too late to remedy it. Her life, my life, both our lives have been lies. Day after day, night after night, I prayed to Christ Jesus, to take away my spirit in order to release my wife from this bondage. But I did not die, and I took to drinking, then to gambling, and all the evil ways the most wicked pursue, became mine. I saw her pine and fade away under a concealed attachment for another, until my heart broke, and I determined upon making an end of me, so she might live for him she still so ardently loves. I know that she loathes the very sight of me, and though she has never uttered your name, except in her sleep, I dare not longer withhold the fact from you that my wife is dying-gradually, but surely-if I remain any longer between her and you." 
                  Never before in all his life did Lionel Harrington feel more astonished than he did in hearing this strange confession. First he could scarcely believe his senses, but as he called his vanity into requisition, and recalled his as well as her youth, when he had paid his attention, and he fancied, not very unsuccessfully, until Edgar Armhold's shadow had come between them, to her, he felt, it must be confessed, a pleasant thrill passing through his frame. 
                  "Broadwell, I believe you are demented to say this," he replied, affecting to make light of all he had heard, but the wily ex-minister, discovered in the very tone of Lionel's voice, the secret gratification his information had given him. 
                  "No, I'm not, Lionel. What I have told you is the sacred truth, and, if you can not think of any plan how to keep my wife from pining away-yes, if you can not counsel me what to do to make her happy-I have but one more favor to ask of you, and that is to give me a decent burial." 
                  After musing over what he had heard for a minute, Lionel lighted another cigar, then rose from his chair and slowly paced the whole length of the floor. Conflicting ideas, strange thoughts, now this, now that, passed through his mind, and bewildered him. He returned, after having made two rounds, to Broadwell, and said, as he sat down by his side: 
                  "I think you are mistaken. Your wife and I have not met for years, and even when we had met, I never, even for a moment, could discover that she felt the least attachment for me." 
                  "Lionel," now said Broadwell, "you can scarcely know with what sense of humiliation I have made this confession to you. Fallen as I am, I'm still a man, and have some feelings-feelings natural to a married man. But my wife is dying, and though I have committed many sins, this crime shall at least not weigh down my soul, to perdition. No, Lionel, she loves you-now don't say a word about it-go and console her." 
                  
                     Go and console her! Did Lionel Harrington hear aright? Was he really requested to visit Hannah-the woman he had once loved with a love ten thousand times stronger and purer than the love he had ever felt for Nellie or any other woman? Was he really requested to save a life from the grave by-by what?" 
                  Here he stopped thinking. The cigar was still in his mouth, and now he watched the smoke as it curled above his head. At last he dropped his hands upon his knees, looked at the unhappy-seeming man by his side, then said: 
                  "I can't go to see your wife, Broadwell-that's nonsense. You don't seem to know what you are talking about. How in the world should I console her? Damn it, I believe you are only trying to make a fool of me!". A moment later-"Even if I should go to your house, what in the world would your wife think?" 
                  "Are you not her cousin?" 
                  "I am." 
                  "Then why not go to see her? Lionel, I feel confident, if she can speak to you-if she can see you and confide in you-she will live and be happy once more." 
                  "Broadwell, I shall not go to see your wife. We have parted as enemies, and to come to visit her now, would only raise suspicion." 
                  "Suspicion of what?" 
                  "Suspicion of wrong." 
                  "Lionel," and now Broadwell rose from his seat, "I know you to be a gentleman, I need say no more. My wife's life is in your hands, do not sacrifice it. Go to see her at once, but let her not know the secret I have apprised you of, lest she would die for shame. See her as a friend, and as an excuse for your visit, say you are looking for me. I am not going home to-night for I can not bear to hear her sigh and moan again." 
                  Now Lionel also rose, and begged Broadwell to be of good cheer, and not (this he said, laughing) to be in a hurry to kill himself. He would be thinking over this matter, and then be more able to give him advice. 
                  So they parted. Broadwell stayed at the club-room, and Lionel made his way down street. He had no particular appointment, and so he strolled along, from one square to another, evidently without any aim, until he stopped before a house on seventh street. After looking up at it for some time, he slowly moved away from it, only to return to it again a few minutes later. This time he did not look up, but with a strange expression in his face, turned into the side-passage, ascended two flights of stairs, and, after slightly tapping at the door, entered the room, as we have described it at the close of the last chapter, to find Hannah lying unconscious on the floor. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXIII. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Around her shone 
                              The light of love, the purity of grace, 
                              The mind, the music breathing from her face; 
                              The heart whose softness harmonize the whole, 
                              And, O: that eye was in itself a soul! 
                           
                         
                        BYRON. 
                      
                   
                  ALTHOUGH Lionel Harrington had come in daily contact with Mr. Broadwell, and knew that the latter had no income whatever, he never suspected-never dreamed of-the extreme poverty to which Hannah and her children had been reduced. It was only after he had entered her room, which was more than scantily furnished, and after he had taken a hasty survey of its contents, that her sad circumstances fell in full force upon his mind. And yet no spark of genuine pity entered his bosom; he belonged to that class of people to which the majority of the human family belong-to that class whose natures are not sufficiently refined to be able to feel, in beholding the miseries of their fellow beings, the pangs attending them. He stood motionless at the threshold for a minute, then noiselessly closed the door behind him, and advanced to where his cousin lay prostrate and unconscious on the floor. Light as his step had been, it had the effect to arouse Hannah. She opened her eyes, and the first glance fell upon Lionel, whose form was slightly bending over her. As if awakened from a terrible dream, or saved from some pending evil by his presence, she jumped to her feet, and wildly throwing her arms around his shoulders, exclaimed: "O, Lionel! Lionel! I am so unhappy!" and she shed a shower of tears on his manly bosom. 
                  After the confession that Broadwell had made to him an hour before, is it to be wondered at that he misunderstood the feelings of his unhappy cousin? "Surely," he thought, "I must have been blind not to have suspected-aye, years ago-her love for me." Now he led, or rather dragged her to a small wooden bench, and seated her by his side. 
                  "I am deeply grieved to hear you say so," he replied, feeling at the same time a secret gratification, "and confess my more than cruelty in having so long neglected you, cousin Hannah," and he took the liberty of pressing her to his heart. 
                  "O, Lionel, Lionel-" 
                  The poor woman couldn't proceed; she was too much moved; she had heard a familiar voice call her "cousin" once more; had found some one who had known her in her better days, and who now sympathized with her, felt for her, and she was almost happy to be permitted to open her heart and weep to him; Lionel, in the meantime, attributed this outburst of feeling-her joy of meeting him-to a cause, the thought of which Broadwell had so insidiously instilled in his mind. 
                  "Cousin Hannah, I've come to help you out of your misery. You seem to have been in want, and it has told on you." Here she began to sob still more. "It is a disgrace that your husband should have treated you thus. From this time forth I want you to throw aside all reserve, and look upon me as one who is entitled to provide for you and your children, not only with the necessaries, but also with the luxuries, of life." 
                  
                     Such generosity she had not heard of for years. "And is it possible," she thought, her eyes brimful with tears, "that God has at last listened to my prayers and sent me a savior?" Lionel," she continued aloud, removing her head from the bosom upon which it had rested, "I cannot tell you how miserable I am! What I have suffered for years-what I am still suffering." 
                  "Forget all this, cousin Hannah, and only remember that your future shall be a happy one. But where is Broadwell? I expected to meet him here! Does he always stay out late at nights!" 
                  Just then her eyes discovered the letter that had fallen into her hands still lying upon the floor. A pang of jealousy shot through her heart, and, we sincerely believe, if she had had it in her power at that moment to annihilate both Broadwell and Carrie, she would have gone to the slaughter with a grim satisfaction. But they were not there, and she pressed her lips together for a minute, then a frown, that reached from temple to temple, seated itself upon her pale brow, as she said: 
                  "Broadwell scarcely ever comes home before midnight, but if he has promised to meet you here, I have no doubt but what he will keep his appointment." 
                  "No, no, he never promised to meet me here; in fact, he has no information of my coming at all. I only expected to find him here, as I was under the impression that he scracely ever left home at nights." 
                  Hannah turned paler. 
                  "He returns from the club very late some times," she replied. 
                  "I can't remember of having ever seen him there after dark." 
                  This information was more than she could stand. She felt as if she had to speak out, and give vent to her jealousy. "Not in the Club-room! "Where else? With Carrie? With that bad woman! For that my children had to suffer! For that they had to starve, while all the money was spent upon-" She rose from her seat, picked up the letter and stuck it in her pocket. Lionel watched her for a moment as she was looking through the window-pane, and a wicked thought passed through his mind. She was still beautiful, and though she had lost the contour of her youth, her figure still possessed that natural grace of which neither poverty nor ill-treatment could deprive her. He called her to his side; she turned around to look at him. 
                  "Come here, I want to speak to you, cousin Hannah." 
                  "What is it?" 
                  "About Broadwell." 
                  She left the window and came to his side. There was no longer a vestige of color in her face, as she said: 
                  "What about Broadwell?" 
                  "He is not worthy of you, Hannah," he continued. "Who knows where he keeps himself all these hours he is away from home! Instead of attending to your wants he lavishes his money upon-" 
                  "Stop, Lionel!" she shrieked in despair, and once more she left his side and repaired to the window. He could see that she was agitated-that she was weeping. He opened his pocket-book and took out several bank-notes. With these in his hand he also quitted his seat and moved across the room. He came up right near to where she stood, then stopped. He could still hear her weep-could see her tearful face reflected in the glass. She appeared to him now even more beautiful than ever. 
                  "Hannah," he said, his voice considerably lowered, "let me be your friend." So saying he pressed the bank-notes in her hand. She looked around, and as her eyes fell on the gift, her face assumed an expression of gratitude, no words, however heartfelt and eloquent, could have described. There was at least sufficient to keep her children from starving for some time, and as that thought took possession of her soul, a prayer was sent heavenward for the timely deliverer. 
                  "Lionel," she said, amid sobs, "my children had nothing to eat all day. You have come to me as the savior of my little ones. God bless you! God bless you!" 
                  She threw herself upon his bosom to weep. 
                  Lionel heard nothing-saw nothing. He only felt her warm heart beating against his own, and his aroused passion got the better of his reason. He twined his strong arms around her fragile waist, pressed her still closer to his bosom, and stamped two fiery kisses upon her lips. 
                  With one jerk Hannah released herself from his embrace, and raising her head proudly aloft, confronted him like an angry goddess-confronted him like a living picture of wounded pride and honor. 
                  "What do you mean, sir!" she shrieked, her breast heavily laboring under the excitement and agitation his conduct had aroused. 
                  "Nothing Hannah, only that I love you." 
                  Her whole face was crimson now, and her eyes seemed to roll in fire. For a minute she knew not what to do, and could not find words to give vent to her feelings. This resistance on her part, instead of bringing Lionel back to reason, excited his passion still more, and unable to master it, he was about to take hold of her hand again, when she rushed back to the other side of the room, drew from the cupboard a glittering knife, and advanced with it to where he stood. 
                  "Villain!" she shrieked, trembling from head to foot, "touch me and you are a dead man. Here, take back your money, and leave my room before I do forget myself and slay you. Do you hear me?" as she saw him hesitate. "Do you hear me? Out of my sight, I say! Out of my sight!" and she opened the door for him to depart. 
                  He walked out without saying another word. 
                  Once more alone, Hannah dropped the knife upon the floor and threw herself upon her knees, and hiding her face in both her hands, began to sob aloud. Her cup of misery was full to the very brim. She could endure no more. "O, Edgar! Edgar!" she shrieked in despair. "O, Edgar! how dearly must I pay for my sins! Take me home to you-O, do take me home to you! I can't-can't stand it any longer." 
                  Her face was literally bathed in tears, as she now raised her eyes heavenward, and with uplifted arms prayed to her maker to let her die. She did not want to live any longer, for life to her was worse than death. She wanted to go to her Edgar and kneel down before him and kiss his feet. 
                  All at once the expression of her face changed, and she grew somewhat cooler. She lowered her head and gazed intently and thoughtfully upon the knife lying a short distance from her. "And if I take my own life?" she thought "what then? Why should I want to live? It must be sweet to be always asleep-always dreaming-it must be sweet!" 
                   
                  Her eyes were still bent upon that knife. She whispered some words inaudibly to herself, then fell in a reverie. She grew paler and calmer. Once something like the shadow of a faint smile passed over her colorless face, but it brought no life into her eyes. She was thinking-thinking what? 
                  Who can tell? 
                  Could she? 
                  She reached out her arm, and a minute later the knife was in her hand. She looked down upon its shiny, glittering blade with a dreamy thoughtfulness. She turned it from one side to the other, and whispered something to herself. 
                  The door opened, and the little figure of the quiet and suffering Emil, threw its shadow along the uncarpeted floor. Hannah raised her head, dropped the knife from her hand, and broke forth in a wild, loud shriek. She jumped to her feet, and rushed to meet her child. She pressed him to her heart, and showered kiss after kiss upon his saintly face. "God! what was I thinking," she exclaimed, "in wishing to take my life! O, Edgar! Edgar! forgive me for having wanted to escape from my earthly ills, and leave my poor boy, my poor children, among strangers without a mother to take care of them. O, my dear Emil!" and she pressed him still fonder to her bosom, and her tears fell upon his calm, dreamy face-not unlike his dead father's-fast and thick. 
                  Again she prayed to God, and as little Emil knelt down beside her, his deep, dreamy eyes, and his thin, bony arms raised heavenward, she lowered her head upon her hands to weep in silence. 
                  "Mother," he said, after a short pause, "do not weep. I have prayed to our father in heaven, and he is so good. I prayed to him to make you happy-he will do it." 
                  The mother looked up, pressed the boy once more to her heart, and covered him with kisses. "And you," she exclaimed, "I wanted to rob of your mother! No, Emil mine, I want to live to watch over my little angel, that nothing may befall him. I am rich-rich in having you my darling, and I will bear all sorrows without a murmur, as long as only God will spare you, for me. I will, my dear, I will, my dear, dear boy." 
                  So saying, she laid her bony hands upon his little head and blessed him, then rose to her feet and said: 
                  "Are the children asleep?" 
                  "They are, mother." 
                  "Do you feel cold?" 
                  "A little, mother." 
                  "Bring in your comforter, child." 
                  Emil did so. 
                  The mother placed it around his neck. 
                  "Now follow me," she said, then extinguished the light, and while tears were coursing down her cheeks, left the room with him. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXIV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Ah me! 
                              The world is full of meetings such as this- 
                              A thrill, a voiceless challenge and reply- 
                              And sudden partings after. 
                           
                         
                        WILLIS'S POEMS. 
                      
                   
                  THE first thing that Carrie Harrington, after her arrival at the Delbanco House, had done, was to send a note for Reuben Armhold to the residence of Mr. Montgomery, informing him of her desire to see him at once at the hotel. Having patiently waited for him almost an hour, she rang the bell, and a minute after, the boy we have seen delivering Carrie's letter to Hannah, stood in her presence. 
                  "To whom did you give that letter?" she inquired. 
                  "I gave it to a servant, who promised to give it to the gentleman." 
                  "Then you don't know whether the gentleman was at home or not?" 
                  "No, ma'am, I didn't ask." 
                  Carrie thoughtfully paced up and down the room for a moment, then turned around and said: 
                  "Here is a half-dollar, boy, go once more to Mr. Montgomery's residence and inquire whether the letter has been delivered to Mr. Armhold." 
                  The boy pocketed the half-dollar, went on his mission, and, after the lapse of something like thirty minutes, returned to inform Carrie Harrington that he had been ordered from the door. 
                  "By whom?" she interrupted him. 
                  "By a young lady-I believe I heard some one call her Miss Nellie." 
                  The boy went out, and Carrie was alone. She threw herself upon a seat and began to study. "Then all is over!" she said to herself. "There is no use to conceal it any longer. I shouldn't be surprised if the whole city knew of my disgrace. Nellie knows it, that's certain. I am an outcast now. God, if Lionel has found it out also! He'll kill me; I know he'll kill me. But he shall never see me more-no, never. I'd sooner die now, than ever look into his face again." 
                  She rang the bell for the second time, and the boy was sent with a letter to Broadwell. An hour passed, and neither one or the other of the gentlemen sent for made their appearance. She became uneasy, restless. "I can't endure this suspense any longer," she said, with a sigh, then threw a shawl around her and left the house. 
                  Hardly was she gone ten minutes before another lady, leading a small boy by the hand, was conducted by a porter toward the room Carrie had just vacated. 
                  "It is locked, madam." 
                  "Locked?" the lady faintly asked. 
                  "Yes, ma'am," replied the porter. "Miss Harrington must have gone away within the last fifteen minutes." 
                  The lady and her boy once more descended the stairs, left the Delbanco House, and were soon lost in the street. 
                  In the mean time Carrie had reached the square upon which the club-hall was situated. She knew the house, for it had been described to her a thousand times by Broadwell. She walked up and down the pavement until she found some one leave the door. Advancing to him, she asked, while her face was covered with a veil, whether Mr. Broadwell was in. Being answered in the affirmative, she begged the gentleman to inform him (Broadwell) to have the kindness to step out upon the pavement for a moment. The gentleman was kind enough to do so, and, after the lapse of something like ten minutes, Broadwell was seen to leave the room, and join the lady on the pavement. 
                  They did not remain long in that locality. They hurried down the street as though they were criminals, upon whose track policemen were following. But ere they had time to turn the corner, a lady and a boy, who were standing on the opposite side, espied them. 
                  "Run, Emil," the lady whispered, "and see who they are. But cover up your face, so they may not recognize you." 
                  The boy sped away, but soon returned again to the side of his mother. 
                  "It is father," he said, "and a lady who much resembles our cousin Carrie." 
                  "Are you tired, Emil?" Hannah asked. 
                  "No, mother." 
                  "Then follow me." 
                  And the two, hand in hand, left the corner and followed, at a respectable distance, the two who had preceded them. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXV. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              O, take me in, a fellow mourner with thee; 
                              I'll number groan for groan, and tear for tear; 
                              And when the fountains of thy eyes are dry, 
                              Mine shall supply the stream, and weep for both! 
                           
                         
                        ROWE'S FAIR PENITENT. 
                      
                   
                  NOTWITHSTANDING the bitter cold weather, many of the streets through which Broadwell and Carrie now passed, were more or less crowded on this dark night. Hannah and her little son Emil moved silently along-now through this square, now through that, heeding neither cold nor hunger-until they arrived in a part of the city where the narrowness of its streets, the filth heaped upon each side of them, the old, quaint and gloomy buildings, and the strange faces, all of the lowest type, which they met, made her pause for a moment and cast a fearful glance around the dismal scene. Should she proceed and follow them to their destination, or turn her back upon this loathsome, impure place, and hasten home, her mission unfulfilled? She halted for a moment to reflect; but ere she had had time to arrive at any conclusion, the noise of a set of drunken roisterers that came up behind them set her once more in motion; and little Emil, led by his mother's hand, could scarcely keep up with her in her flight from the wild and reckless rowdies, who were calling upon her, in a voice more loud than musical, to stop. She knew not and cared not whither her feet led her, so they took her beyond the reach of these terrible men behind her. And not until the noise had entirely subsided, and furtive glances thrown in the direction from whence they had been coming had assured her that they were no longer on her track, did she pause and take breath. 
                  "Thank God, we have escaped them!" she whispered, and turned about. 
                  She breathed easier, for the street in which she now found herself was a public thoroughfare, lighted up, and unfrequented by the scum of society. But where were Broadwell and Carrie? She had lost sight of them, and as she glanced in all directions open to her view and could not espy them, she heaved a long sigh, drew the boy a little closer to her side, turned around, and, while the wind was sharply whizzing into her ears, retraced her steps back into the city. 
                  For nearly a half-hour she walked on without addressing a word to the boy, whose little hand she kept warm between her own, which was freezing. Only once, as an unusually strong gust of wind greeted them and made Emil's ears tingle, the mother looked down upon her child, and as she observed his face, red and shivering from cold, she stooped and pressed a kiss upon his blue lips, and then, lifting him upon her arm, threw her own shawl over him, and moved once more. 
                  "Mother, please let me down; I can walk as far as you want me to." 
                  She said nothing in return; but a big tear left her eye and rolled down her cheeks. 
                  "Mother, I don't want to be carried; please let me down." 
                  "You must be tired, Emil; and I know you are cold, for I can hear and feel you shiver. We'll soon be home, darling, and then you can go to bed and sleep well-won't you, my darling?" 
                  "Are we going home, mother?" Emil inquired. 
                  "Yes, you are going home, and I shall soon follow you. I want you to see how the children are, and if they are quiet, you slip into your bed; you need not wait for me." 
                  "But, mother, may I not go along with you? I am not sleepy, and I think I could go a good piece yet before getting tired." 
                  "No, my Emil," Hannah replied; "you must go home, for the children are all alone." 
                  By this time they had reached the square upon which they lived. Hannah lowered the boy, gave him some few more parting injunctions, and then sent him home, while she herself went in an opposite direction. We catch up with her again, after the lapse of something like twenty minutes, at the Delbanco House, before which she had just arrived. 
                  She rang the bell, and a colored woman answered the call. 
                  "Can you tell me whether Miss Harrington is in her room?" inquired Hannah. 
                  "It is scarcely five minutes since she returned," replied the servant. "Please enter the parlor, while I hand her your card." 
                  "No, no, I do not wish to send up my card. Just tell her a lady would like to see her in her own room, if only for a few moments." 
                  The servant retired, but soon returned to inquire the name. 
                  "Has Miss Harrington retired already?" inquired Hannah, undecided as to whether she should send up her name or not. 
                  "Not yet, but she seemed to be in the act of doing so. What is your name, if you please, ma'am?" 
                  "Come, girl, lead me to her room; I know Miss Harrington well, and I want to surprise her," replied Hannah, after arriving at the conclusion that it were better to withhold her name. 
                  The girl could see nothing wrong in complying with her wish; so she led her up a flight of stairs, and conducted her to the door of Carrie's room. 
                  We will not enter upon a description of the feelings of the two cousins, as the door had noiselessly closed behind Hannah, who was now face to face with the woman who, her own heart told her, had the power to destroy Broadwell, and through him his children, and upon whose face "maternity" was written in every line. But Hannah, though a wife, was not moved now by any feeling of jealousy, though the woman before her shared her husband's love. The injuries done to the wife were lost in the injuries done to the mother, and she thought not of the humiliation which Broadwell had caused her. 
                  When Carrie saw her cousin enter, her first thoughts were to order her from her room; but no sooner did she behold that sad face, that almost tottering step, that scanty attire, than a revulsion took place in her feelings, and Carrie Harrington in that instant forgot the past, all and every thing that had passed in the intervening time; and as she once more fancied herself upon the threshold of childhood, tears gushed to her eyes, and she ran half-way across the room to meet and embrace her cousin. But before she had time to execute her design, Hannah lay prostrate upon the floor, encircling with her shivering arms, and kissing, her cousin's feet. 
                  "Have pity on my children," she said, and her sobs, loud as they were, were scarcely audible; for Carrie, so taken by surprise, and moved by Hannah's wretched appearance, lost control over her own feelings, forgot her own resolves, and was once more the innocent, girlish woman she had long since ceased to be, and she wept aloud. 
                  Both lay now on the hard floor, in each other's embrace, mingling their tears of woe. Neither spoke for some time, until at last Hannah rose to her feet, and requested her cousin to do likewise. They now sat down together, and after a short pause, Hannah, having regained her self-composure, and remembering that it was late and that her children needed her presence, drew up a little closer to her cousin, and said: 
                  "Carrie, I have not come here to upbraid you." Carrie hid her face in her hands, and again began to cry. "No, I scarcely know of what to accuse you. The letter you had addressed to Mr. Broadwell fell, as you are perhaps aware, not into his, but into my hands. All I know is what I read in there, and it is enough, even had I no other sorrows, to drive me to despair and break my heart. But I've come here-I've searched for you, Carrie"-here she broke down, and her voice was forced and sad-"to beg you to have pity on my children, and not expose their father for any wrongs you may have suffered on his account. They can not help what he--" 
                  She could not proceed; her bitter feelings overpowered her. She did her face in the coarse woolen shawl she had thrown around her shoulders, and wept in silence. 
                  "Hannah," said Carrie, "your husband has destroyed my future, and if I were not too great a coward, I would end my life at once. That you have suffered much, your very looks indicate; that I have suffered no less-more than you are aware of-my heart, if not my face, could tell. It is your husband, Hannah, who has led me astray; and look at me now-see what I am! An outcast-a woman toward whom all honest folks will point their fingers, and mark out as one that should be shunned. All the contrition, all the penance in the world-you know that as well as I do-could not now redeem me from my fallen state. I have no longer a home-no longer a pillow to lay my head upon. I know not which way to turn, for I have no longer any friends this side the grave. I know not whether Lionel has yet heard of my shame; if he does not know it, the morrow's paper will apprise him of it, for--" 
                  "What have you done?-in God's name, tell me!" exclaimed Hannah, turning pale as ashes, and trembling from head to foot. "You surely have not exposed--" 
                  "I have exposed all," added Carrie, in a spirit that brought to light her own recklessness. "Yes, I have exposed all; and I should not be surprised if Broadwell was in the City Prison by this time." 
                  "O God! you have not done that? You surely have not had him arrested?" Hannah inquired almost fainting. 
                  "I have." 
                  No sooner had Hannah heard these words than a sharp pang shot through her heart, and something like a dark mist obscured her sight. Pale as she was, she turned still paler, and her eyes, with a blank, vague, and unmeaning look, peered through the window-pane into the dark outside. Thus she sat for nearly five minutes, when she rose from her chair. There was no hurry, no precipitancy exhibited in her doing so. She rose calmly, and wound the shawl around her shoulders, and then walked toward the door, without uttering a syllable or even looking back at her cousin. Poor woman! her heart was now broken; this last misfortune had done the work. She gave up now. One could see it as she moved, with an almost tottering step, across the room-her back rounded, her shoulders stooped in, and her head bent over her form. The little strength she had possessed was gone, and she felt feeble as age itself. 
                  Having reached the door, she stopped for a moment, when, her feet unwilling to serve her longer, she dropped down. In an instant Carrie was by her side, and, with tears in her eyes, assisted her to rise. 
                  "O, Hannah, Hannah, do not leave me thus! Come in and take a stimulant. O God, what have I done!" 
                  Hannah said nothing in return, nor did she look around. Being once more on her feet, she descended the flight of stairs, and made her way back into the street. 
                  Carrie's eyes were still vaguely gazing down upon that passage-long, very long-an hour after Hannah had made her egress from it. Then a heavy sigh rose from her bosom, and recollecting herself, she returned to her room. But she had no rest there, and long after midnight she was still pacing up and down the floor. She could not cry, though she felt like doing so, and her heart was unusually heavily oppressed. 
                  It struck one-two-and still she was up and awake. At three she retired, with tears in her eyes. She had come to a conclusion which brought peace to her mind. She experienced at that moment the happiness of a martyr. She would spare one and all; Broadwell, Hannah, Lionel, and Reuben-one and all were to be benefited by her resolve. On the following morning she would make a great sacrifice, and carry her resolve into execution. Thus she fell asleep, and the smile seen hovering around a dead angel's face lighted up her own features, giving them an expression of peaceful resignation. 
                  At five o'clock she awoke. She dressed herself hurriedly, took a hasty breakfast, and then, after throwing a warm shawl around her, stepped out into the street. An early newsboy was leaning, muffled up to the chin, against the lamp-post a pace ahead of her. As she came along, he pulled out a morning issue, with the usual "D' you want to buy a paper?" and as she passed him, he added, "All about the murder!" 
                  She stopped as if she had been stunned. Something spoke to her of danger. She returned and bought one of the newsboy's Enquirers. She looked at its headings. The letters were of unusually large size, all caps, and it required but a single glance to become acquainted with its meaning. Carrie had seen enough at that single glance; her whole frame seemed to break asunder. Death was written on her face, her teeth chattered together, her knees shook, and her feet felt heavy, as she hid her face in her shawl, rushed back into the house, and fled up stairs to find-a stranger in her room. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XXVI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              Twice it called, so loudly called, 
                              With horrid strength, beyond the pitch of nature; 
                              And murder! murder! was the dreadful cry. 
                           
                         
                        JOANNA BAILLIE'S DE MONTFORD. 
                      
                   
                  THOUGH Broadwell did not return to the coffee-house across the canal, the barkeeper, nevertheless, did take care of Reuben Armhold, and suffered him to enjoy an undisturbed sleep, which was not broken until the clock struck ten. 
                  "Where am I?" he muttered to himself; and as he looked about he recollected distinctly how and with whom he had come there. Not knowing that he had slept so long, he was considerably surprised not to find Broadwell, where he had left him, by his side. 
                  "Where is the gentleman who came in with me?" he inquired of the barkeeper, of whom he had just ordered the cigar he was lighting. 
                  "The gentleman? O, yes; he went away long ago." 
                  "Long ago!" he echoed. 
                  "Yes; and he told me to take care of you for a few minutes," added the man. 
                  "He did?" and Reuben became thoughtful, and looking at the smoke of his cigar for a minute or two, he called for his bill. "Or did he pay for it?" he inquired, as he handed the money over the counter. 
                  "Not he," said our Teutonic friend, grinning from ear to ear. "No, not he; he did not look as one who felt inclined to pay for any thing." 
                  Reuben having settled the full bill, buttoned up his heavy coat, and stepped out into the street. "I wonder what made him leave me in this manner?" he thought, and a feeling of anger rose in his bosom for the man whom he, a few hours ago, began almost to like on account of his utter depravity. "What if he knew of my difficulties? Would he lend me a helping hand? Would-" A strange thought flashed across his brain, indistinct at first, but growing clearer and clearer as it took possession of his mind. "Could it not be possible"-He put his hands in his coat-pocket, and increased his speed as he crossed the canal and made his way into town. "By G-d, it is so!" He walked still faster, seeing neither here nor there, until he reached the club-room, where he inquired, after a fruitless search, whether Broadwell had been there. As chance would have it, the inquiry was addressed to the same person who had been requested by Carrie to call Broadwell out upon the street. 
                  "Yes," he replied to Reuben, "he was here, and went away again. In fact, a lady-I could not see her face, for it was vailed-had had him called out, and I saw him hurry away with her. I bet my life on it, she was one of his fast ones. Ain't it a strange thing that a man, after having resigned being a minister, forgets every thing pertaining to that profession except his licentious ways?" 
                  Reuben did not stay to listen to the last remark. He was once more on the street, a peculiarly grim seriousness sharpening his features. He was soon on his way down Seventh-street, inquiring now and then for a certain house number. At last he stopped; it was before Broadwell's dwelling. Just then little Emil was about to enter in the side passage. Reuben stopped him. 
                  "Who are you, boy?" 
                  The fragile child shrunk within himself, for the stranger's voice was harsh. 
                  "I am Emil Armhold." 
                  Reuben looked at him, and fancied to see Edgar as he had been in his childhood. 
                  "Emil Armhold is your name?" he said, kindly, taking the boy by the hand. "Where is your father?" 
                  "In heaven, mother says." 
                  A tear, against his own will, forced its way into Reuben's eye. "I don't mean him," he said, his voice fearfully hoarse. "Where is Broadwell?" 
                  "He is way down town; mother and I just saw him walking with my cousin." 
                  "What cousin?" 
                  "With Carrie, we thought, but we were not quite sure." 
                  "Where are they now? Don't fear me, child; I would not hurt you for all the world. Where are they now?" 
                  "I don't know; mother and I lost sight of them." 
                  "And where is your mother?" 
                  "I don't know. She told me to go home and take care of the children. Why? Do you want to see her?" 
                  "No." 
                  Again Reuben was on the tramp. This time he went in a more fashionable vicinity, and shortly afterward entered the clerk's office of the Delbanco House. Having examined the register, he inquired: 
                  "When did Miss Harrington arrive?" 
                  "She arrived this evening." 
                  "I should like to see her." 
                  The clerk called a boy, and sent him up to the lady's room with the gentleman's card, but he soon returned with the information that the lady was out-gone, perhaps, to Mr. Broadwell's. 
                  "Why to Mr. Broadwell's?" Reuben inquired, eagerly. 
                  "Because Miss Harrington has twice sent me to his house, and as I could not find him, has, perhaps, gone after him herself." 
                  Reuben went out again, and once more turned into Seventh-street. It struck half-past eleven when he reached the vicinity of Broadwell's home. Here he stopped a moment, undecided whether to proceed up stairs or wait below. He resolved upon going straight into Broadwell's dwelling, and wait there for his coming. He was terribly in earnest to settle their difficulty there and then. Thus determined, he approached the passage through which one had to go in order to reach the third floor, occupied by Hannah. 
                  He was already in the yard, when a strange voice, evidently from above, drew his attention, and he stopped to listen. Presently some one rushed down stairs, five steps at a time, giving him scarcely time enough to conceal himself. But he did succeed in concealing himself in the rear of the house, where he had the advantage of seeing without being seen. 
                  The man sped through the passage, and Reuben, who had recognized him, stole from his hiding-place, and once more, with a grim smile upon his face, stepped out upon the street. 
                  When Hannah returned home, some few minutes later, and opened the door of her room, what must have been her surprise to behold, upon the reeking floor-right in the center of her room-a man lying murdered, besmeared and bespattered with blood.

                  THE stranger whom Carrie found in her room wore the garb of an officer of the police force. On seeing her he advanced a few steps, and, without taking the least notice of the excitement under which she labored, he inquired in a cool, feelingless voice, whether the name of the lady he was addressing was Miss Carrie Harrington. 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  She threw herself upon a chair, and with trembling hands was in the act of raising the journal she had purchashed on the street to her eyes, when the policeman took out a paper from his pocket and while looking down upon it, said: 
                  "I have a warrant against you, Miss Harrington. I am sorry to be under the necessity to inform you, that you will have to come along with me." 
                  She lifted her head and stared at the stranger, as if she had not comprehended him. 
                  "A warrant against me?" she exclaimed, in a piercing tone, while amazement sat upon her pale transparent brow; "I to go along with you? Who are you?" 
                  Not in the least angered, the stranger, a half smile playing on his lips, replied: 
                  "I am, as you can see by this star," pointing to the lapel of his coat, "an officer in the service of the city, holding a warrant in my hands to arrest you, by the order of the Chief of Police. I am sorry to tell you that you have to accompany me at once to the station-house." 
                  "O no, O, no," she cried. "You surely can not mean me-" 
                  The police officer interrupted her at once. He was not particularly fond of "scenes;" and as there were indications of a bright "scene," he thought it best to cut it short in time. 
                  "I see no use in crying," he said, putting the warrant back into his pocket; "for it won't remedy the case one particle. All they want you for is, I believe, as a witness in a murder case. The preliminary trial is to come off sometime during the day. I do not know," he continued, "why you should hesitate at all, ma'am; had a brother of mine been murdered, you would not find me slow in giving in such testimony as would throw light upon the mystery." 
                  Up to this time Carrie's eyes had been resting on the officer's face. Now she lowered them, and, as she did so, her head drooped upon her bosom, the Enquirer fell from her hands, and her arms dropped heavily down by her sides. 
                  She had fainted. The last sentence spoken by the policeman had told her the whole tale. On the street already she had read the caption- 
                        MURDER! BROADWELL, THE SUPPOSED ASSASSIN, FLED TO PARTS UNKNOWN. A GREAT MYSTERY INVOLVED! A CHAPTER OF CRIME ABOUT TO BE BROUGHT TO LIGHT.
                     
                   
                  There was no need for her to read the article under it; for who the victim was had flashed across her mind at once-even before the policeman had finished his sentence. It could be no other than her brother-her own Lionel. 
                  The officer was no sooner aware of the lady's state of unconsciousness into which his information had thrown her, than he rang the bell, which brought, a minute later, a servant into the room. 
                  "This lady has fainted away," he said, very composedly. "Have you some water handy-vinegar, perhaps would do better-to resuscitate her again?" 
                  "Yes, sir;" and the servant ran to a dressing case standing at the other extremity of the room. It took her but a minute to have the requisite restoratives; and, while she is busily engaged in applying them, let us pick up the paper and acquaint ourselves with the particulars, as far as they can be gleaned from the article, headed as above noted, of this murder: 
                  
                     "One of those atrocious crimes which now and then lifts its hideous head in large communities, to shock and horrify the sensibilities of the most hardened natures, was perpetrated in our midst between ten and twelve o'clock last night. The particulars, as far as we could learn, are as follows: On Seventh Street, almost near the outskirts of the city, in one of the oldest and most gloomy-looking tenement house, well known to many of our citizens as a home and rendezvous of burglars, thieves, and, as it has proved, murderers, that have eluded the vigilance of our police-force, resides a man known by the name of Broadwell, and his wife, dreaded by the neighbors on account of her quarrelsomeness and recklessly dangerous disposition, with their four or five children. On account of some reasons we deem prudent to withhold for the present Mr. Lionel Harrington, a young man of great promise and connected with our best and most highly esteemed citizens, was compelled to seek an interview with said Broadwell at the latter's house, which he was destined never more to leave alive. And had it not been for the accidental arriving of a certain Mr. Reuben Armhold before the said house, just in time to see a man, besmeared with blood, make his way from the passage that leads directly from the stairs into the street, there is all probability that the crime would never have come to light. But the gentleman, who suspected something wrong, sped after the fleeing, and apprised the police of the fact. Our reporter did not follow the posse who went after the feet-footed criminal, who had a pretty good start of them, and therefore we can not say whether or not he was arrested in his flight. Our reporter joined the posse that started back, in company with Mr. Armhold, to the premises, from which a cry of pain had first attracted the latter's attention. They now went up several flights of stairs, guided by the reflection of a light to a room, which they at once opened, and found, lying on the floor, to their great dismay, the body of a murdered man, still weltering in his hot blood, and which was at once recognized by the gentleman who had conducted them to that den of vice, as the body of Lionel Harrington. By the side of the corpse knelt a woman-an ugly and dangerous looking virago-in the act of wiping away the blood, in all probability to conceal the crime-as many others might have been concealed by her-who said her name was Mrs. Broadwell, but, to all appearance, is simply his companion in crime. She was at once taken in custody, and, notwithstanding her cries and appeals, her resistance was fruitless, and she was dragged from the room and now occupies a cell in the city prison, preparatory to the one in the State prison she is destined to occupy in the future. The Coroner's inquest and the trial will be some time during the day, and, as we do not wish to mislead or bias the minds of the readers, we will defer giving our opinion until more light has been thrown upon this atrocious affair."
                   
                  Carrie was soon restored to consciousness. After opening her eyes and looking wildly around her as if to collect herself, and while the servant was retiring with an unsatisfied and inquisitive stare at the lady and her strange visitor, she begged with tears in her eyes, the officer to tell her all and every thing, connected with this murder, as she was fully prepared to hear the worst. 
                  "Here, ma'am," he said as he stooped down to pick up the paper she had dropped and placed it in her own hand, "I think you can find all the information so far obtained." 
                  Long and silently she gazed down upon the article we have just quoted above, long enough to have read it over full a dozen times. She neither stirred nor gave any other signs of life; at last, however, a heavy sigh arose from her surcharged heart, which was followed by another and another; then, with a wild, piercing shriek, she left her seat, and wailing, as if her own heart was no longer strong enough to bear up under this last and unexpected calamity, threw herself upon her bed, and burying her face in its pillows, exclaimed amid the sobs that seemed almost to choke her: "O, Lionel! O, Lionel! My Lionel is dead!" 
                  For some time she was allowed to give vent to her grief unmolested, the policeman showing that humane feeling so unfrequently found in men whose natures have hardened by their continual contact with all classes and grades of criminals. Seeing, however, that there was no likelihood of calming the lady by any consolation that he might reach her, he simply said, after a short pause: 
                  "Miss Harrington, I truly regret the necessity of reminding you of my unpleasant duty. You will please make yourself ready to accompany me to the station-house. You need not fear any thing. In all probability you will be required simply to give in your testimony, when you can depart again." 
                  Carrie, after a little more weeping and moaning, rose, made a hasty toilet, then informed the policeman she was ready to follow him. 
                  It was between the hours of two and three of the same day that an officer presented himself in the room that had held her prisoner since she had been arrested, and informed her that she must follow him to the Police Court, where the preliminary trial was to be held. 
                  She accompanied him without uttering a syllable; she was evidently composed and prepared for the coming ordeal. But no sooner had she been conducted into the court-room, and found all eyes turned upon her, than her courage failed her, as it never had failed her before, and her knees began to shake, and her feet began to totter, and nothing save the railing, upon which she held herself, prevented her from sliding upon the floor. 
                  "This way," whispered the officer, and he led her to a seat at the extreme left of, and close by, the prisoners' bench. 
                  We have said her courage had failed on entering the police-room; and as she now, after having taken the seat assigned her, threw around her a glance from one face to another, a chill involuntarily crept through her frame, and a feeling of disgust removed all fear, and took possession of her soul. 
                  Though it is not our province now to write, and perhaps not your willingness to listen to, a treatise on propriety, we can not refrain from giving expression to our unqualified disgust at the conduct of some of the officials, whose duty it evidently should be, in remembering the respect due them as officers of the law, not to forget the dignity they should observe in the halls of justice. The trial had not yet commenced, and the court seemed waiting for the arrival of one of the supposed criminals, from whose dungeon she was momentarily expected. The court-room was crowded to overflowing, and the judge, with a calm and dignified mien, looked down from his high seat upon the many spectators, whom the importance of the case had brought hither, and whose faces, when closely observed, wore marks of debauchery, sin, and crime, as palpably as ever were seen upon the countenances of the unfortunate prisoners they had come here a thousand times to hear tried and see-condemned. Close by the judge, and to his right, sat two clerks, sleek and fat, having grown so by extortions of, and overcharges to, the poor devils who are always destined to be fleeced, but by no others more than by the unlicensed, rapacious minions of the Police Court. They were also looking down upon the crowd, now laughing, now winking, now heartlessly pointing to some poor 
                      
                        CARRIE AND LIONEL. 
                     
                     
                      wretch sitting near the prisoners' bench. To the left of the judge stood the assistant marshal, with a mallet in his hand, more like a prize-fighter than a representative of order and authority. In front of the stalls sat several seedy-looking gentlemen, who might have been mistaken for vagabonds, were it not for their total want of respect both for themselves and those around them, which at once reminded you of being in the presence of the police lawyers in search of small game. They rushed now here, now there, ever busy exhibiting their ravenous faces to the prisoners they are about, and the spectators they still hoped, to fleece. On the left of the prisoners' bench sat, around a small table, the reporters of the various city papers. One glance at their physiognomies led one to fear that the same honors they were now paying the prisoners, would some day be also their own. Responsible as their positions are, ninety-nine out of one hundred are unfit to hold them. With what little mercy do they hold up the erring creatures of the prisoners' bench, in their sensational reports-and many futures are forever destroyed by one thoughtless stroke of their irresponsible pens. 
                  Carrie, as we have said before, looked around at those hardened faces, and instead of a sense of awe, a feeling of disgust pervaded her being. Just then her eye fell on Reuben Armhold, who was seated but a short distance from her, and who must have entered the room since her own arrival. The blood rushed to her cheeks as their eyes met, and her heart began to palpitate more strongly. 
                  Once more the door opened, and this time all eyes were turned toward the new comers. Noisy as all had been, a strange stillness pervaded now the whole house, as Hannah, pale as death, but no less dignified-both in her mien and gait-than she was pale, accompanied by a watchman, was conducted through the gaping crowd to a seat on the prisoners' bench. For a moment she felt a weakness steal into her frame, and, had not the clerks seated near the judge began to smile as they gazed down upon her, she might have succumbed to the bitterness of her situation and wept; but now, humbled as she was-aye, crushed to the very dust, the native pride of the Prestons came once more to her rescue, and her heart hardened at once, and she looked-a figure of stone. 
                  The judge inquired now whether the Court was ready to go on with the trial, and, being answered in the affirmative, the marshal called "Order," after which one of the clerks read a State warrant, charging Mr. C. Broadwell and his wife, Hannah Broadwell, as the murderers of Lionel Harrington. The prosecuting attorney now rose, informing his honor that the man Broadwell had made his escape from the house in which the crime had been concocted, before the police had been apprised of the deed, but the woman, who was passing herself as his wife, (a tear came into Hannah's eyes as she heard that remark) was in court, having been caught seated by the side of the murdered man. If it pleases the honorable court, he continued, unfolding a paper he had been holding in his hand, he would read the coroner's verdict, after which he would be ready to proceed with the trial. 
                  The verdict was brief and quickly read. It simply stated the fact that a man, whose name was Lionel Harrington, and having belonged, as far as the jury had been informed, to the first families of our city, was murdered, by the use of some sharp instrument-in all probability a dagger-in the hands of some unknown person, in the room occupied by Mr and Mrs. Broadwell, on the night of the 22d of February, 18-. 
                  A police-officer, who had made the arrest, was now brought to the witness-stand, and, after being duly sworn in, informed the court how he had been hailed on the previous night, while on duty, by a gentleman (pointing toward Mr. Armhold), who was in court now, to arrest a certain Mr. Broadwell, whom he had seen rushing from his house, besmeared with blood, and fleeing for his very life. That he had followed the direction the man Broadwell had taken, but had been unable to catch him. 
                  Now another police officer was brought to the stand, and sworn in. He told the court that he went with Mr. Armhold, who had given him the first information, to the house in which the crime had been committed, and there found the woman (pointing to Hannah) sitting beside the dead man's body. That he had at once arrested her, and brought her to the station-house, from whence she had just been brought to attend the trial. 
                  He sat down, and once more all was still. All eyes were turned upon the prisoners' bench, where Hannah sat, all alone, her face haggard and wan, her eyes sunken, and her hair dry, and disorderly twisted in a knot on the back of her head. She was far from being prepossessing, and her thin, almost worn-out dress, of the coarsest texture, by no means raised her in the estimation of the spectators. His honor, the judge, now inquired whether she was ready for trial, and, being answered in the affirmative, wanted to know whether she had engaged counsel to conduct her case. 
                  She rose from her seat, and bringing herself to her full hight, informed the court that she wanted none. Having uttered this with a grace and dignity scarcely ever witnessed at a police-court, it was sufficient to make the clerks, perched on their seats, smile, which, like a contagion, soon infected the whole court, and the judge had the mortification, and the marshal and police-officers the gratification of having to listen to the poorly suppressed laughter of the unfeeling crowd. 
                   
                  "You had better engage counsel," urged the judge, looking with some pity, and a kind of respect, upon the prisoner, "to conduct this case. If it is your desire, the court will appoint one for you." 
                  "I do not require one," she said, without raising her head. 
                  The prosecuting attorney now rose, and, calling Hannah to the witness-stand, asked her, after being duly sworn, the following questions: 
                  "What is your name?" 
                  "Hannah Broadwell." 
                  "Are you a married woman?" 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "Who is your husband?" 
                  "Mr. Broadwell." 
                  "What is his Christian name?" 
                  "Charles." 
                  "Charles.-What is his business?" 
                  Hannah remained silent for a moment, and her heart began to throb faster. 
                  "What does he do for a living?" persisted the prosecuting attorney. 
                  "I do not know, sir." 
                  "You do not know? That's strange. Where is he now?" 
                  "I can not tell." 
                  "You can not tell?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Mrs. Broadwell," continued the prosecuting attorney, "now tell the court, how it was that a dead body was found in your room, and you seated by his side?" 
                  "I don't know how the dead body was brought into my room; when I arrived home I found it there." 
                  "Then you were not at home last night?" 
                  "No, sir." 
                  "Where were you?" 
                  Once more she hesitated. 
                  "Where were you, Mrs. Broadwell?" 
                  "I can not answer this question." 
                  "Why not?" 
                  "Because I can not." 
                  "Mrs. Broadwell, it will be to your interest to answer this question unequivocally." 
                  "Sir, I know nothing of this murder, and, though I was found looking down upon the corpse, I am as innocent of the crime as my own dear children." 
                  Here she broke down. Her voice failed her, and she began to weep. 
                  She was now called upon to take her seat for awhile. 
                  She left the stand, her head buried in her hands, and sat down upon the prisoners' bench. 
                  The prosecuting attorney now requested that the witnesses for the State would be called up and sworn in. 
                  The first witness called up to the stand was Reuben Armhold. No sooner had he made his appearance, than a wild scream sounded through the hall, and Hannah lay unconscious on the floor. Some of the spectators now rushed from their seats, in order to have a better view of the catastrophe; but the marshal, in his stentorian voice, called the court to order, and, after a few minutes, all was quiet once more. Hannah was unconscious but for a moment; once more she sat, calm and rigid, upon the bench. 
                  The examination was now continued. 
                  "What is your name, sir?" inquired the prosecuting attorney. 
                  "My name is Reuben Armhold." 
                  "Do you reside in the city?" 
                  "I do." 
                  "Tell the court all you know about this case." 
                  Here he recited, briefly and distinctly, how and when he had arrived before Broadwell's house; how the noise had attracted his attention; and how, a few minutes later, Broadwell had fled through the passage into the street. He also told the court how, upon his arrival with one of the reporters of the daily papers, and in company with these gentlemen (pointing to some policemen) in the room occupied by Mr. Broadwell he had found this lady stooping, or sitting, he was not certain which, near the corpse of the murdered man. 
                  "Will you, Mr. Armhold, please inform the court whether you knew the deceased?" questioned the prosecuting attorney. 
                  "I did." 
                  "Do you also know this lady, the prisoner?" 
                  "I do." 
                  "Tell the court what you know of her." 
                  "I simply know her to be the wife of Mr. Broadwell." 
                  "Do you know any thing against her character?" 
                  "In what respect?" 
                  "In regard to her mode of life; her disposition; whether she would be capable of committing murder under certain provocation." 
                  "Murder? No! Poor as my opinion is of the woman, I don't think she would be guilty of murder." 
                  Hannah covered her face and began to weep. 
                  "Do you believe," continued the prosecuting attorney, "by the knowledge you possess of the character of her husband, that he would be capable of murder?" 
                  Reuben's breast dilated, and his eyes glistened with a dangerous fire. 
                  "Believe him capable of committing murder?" he answered, full of animation. "Yes, capable of every crime under the sun." 
                  All eyes were turned upon him now. 
                  "And do you believe the prisoner here, who was found near the corpse, could have been induced by her husband to become an accomplice in this assassination?" 
                  "No." 
                  "You can sit down for the present." 
                  Reuben left the witness-stand to give room to Miss Carrie Harrington, whose name the clerk had called out. She advanced with a slow, nervous step, but before she had gone half the distance she felt herself bereft of all fortitude and strength. She knew all eyes were turned upon her, even those of Reuben and Hannah, and a sort of faintness that had come over her threatened to make her unequal to the ordeal before her. Besides, she was too bewildered to think, and, strange as it may seem, and as dearly as she had loved her brother, from the time she had entered the court-room to the present moment she had given scarcely a single thought to any thing save her own private wrongs, which still haunted and lay uppermost in her mind. She had taken no interest in the trial, and would have cheerfully left the whole scene in which the supposed murderer of her brother was examined. She did not think Hannah guilty of the crime, and as she did not doubt for a moment her innocence would be established before the court adjourned, her mind was at rest upon that score, and dwelt, as westated before, chiefly upon her own personal troubles. It was only after she had been sworn in, and the agreeable voice of the prosecuting attorney uttered her name, that she raised her head and gathered her wandering thoughts. 
                  "What is your name?" he asked, very respectfully, a tone of sympathy in his voice. 
                  "Carrie Harrington." 
                  "You are the sister of the deceased?" he continued. 
                  "I am," she replied. 
                  "Do you know this woman?" and he turned his finger toward Mrs. Broadwell, who sat there holding her body quite erect now, and keeping her eyes, in which all tears had dried up, steadily fixed upon Carrie's face, which was, if not so emaciated, at least equally as pale and sad as her own. For a moment those eyes met, and Miss Harrington thought that never in all her life before had she loved her cousin better and more unselfishly than she did at that moment. 
                  "Yes," she replied," scarcely having sufficient control over herself to keep the tears from filling her eyes, "she is my cousin." 
                  The prosecuting attorney, not knowing nor believing that such a relationship existed between the murdered man who had belonged to the best of society and the prisoner-the woman of whom the worst reports the morning papers had gratuitously published in their columns, was of the opinion that the witness must have misunderstood him. He therefore repeated the question, once more, pointing to Mrs. Broadwell. 
                  "Yes, sir, she is my cousin," she replied, almost ready to rush from the stand into Hannah's arms. 
                  "Your cousin. Now please tell the court," the prosecuting attorney continued interrogating, "whether you know of any ill-feelings that may have existed between your brother and this lady." 
                  "I know of none in particular." 
                  "Why do you say in particular, Miss Harrington?" he continued, now riveting a pair of sharp gray eyes upon her face, that seemed to pierce her very soul, and read as with a glass, its innermost secrets. She began to tremble, but scarcely knew why. A strange fear came over her, and she fancied that her disgrace, which she had so long labored to conceal, would, ere she could leave the room, be drawn from her by that man. She wanted to turn her gaze downward, but somehow she could not muster enough courage to act up to her inclination, and all she could do was-to look straight into his face. She felt that she was nothing more in the presence of that man, who could be so sweet-tongued, and yet so dangerously fascinating, than the tiniest kid in the paws of a lion. She was also aware that he looked upon her now with a far greater interest, for something-she could not tell what it was-in his half smiling, half serious expression, told her as plainly as a sign in the face can tell, that he regarded her with possessing more knowledge than any other or all the state witnesses that had been examined before her. And this opinion was now still more strengthened in her, and her fortitude continued to ebb entirely away, when she saw the smile around his lips grow more palpable, as he repeated, in a still more confiding, and in a far sweeter voice: 
                  "Why do you say 'in particular,' Miss Harrington?" Then, as if he put no importance on the question at all, or the answer she would give it, he begged her to be seated on the chair that stood behind her, but still keeping his eyes riveted upon her's, as by so doing he could deprive her of the power of giving a false statement. And he was correct. Carrie sooner would have ventured to flee from the court-room, be the consequences what they might, than to have said an untruth, while that fearful pleasant man's eyes, were so steadily riveted to her own. 
                  "I said 'in particular,'" she replied, growing more nervous "because something like a coldness had existed between them for years." 
                  "And can you tell the court, Miss Harrington," he continued, "why and how this coldness had sprung up between your brother and Mrs. Broadwell?" 
                  Of course she could, and worse than that: she did tell all she knew; and in less than an hour the secret she had so carefully concealed, and the exposure of which she had so much dreaded, was no longer entirely her own. During the examination she had confessed that she had sent a note to her brother, on the night of the murder, containing a statement of all the sufferings she had endured on account of Mr. Broadwell, and calling upon him to bring the seducer to account. 
                  It was very plain to the court how the difficulty arose between the deceased and the man whose wife was still sitting on the prisoner's bench. But whether she was herself implicated in this crime, was a question that had to be decided now, and, therefore, the prosecuting attorney continued his inquiries: 
                  "Miss Harrington, when did you see the prisoner the last time?" 
                  "Last night." 
                  "Between what hours?" 
                  "I do not recollect the precise hour; it must have been, however, between the hours of ten and twelve." 
                  "Please tell the court what brought her to your room at so late an hour in the night?" 
                  "She came to me for the purpose of begging me to spare her husband." 
                  "Spare her husband from what?" 
                  "From exposure." 
                  The examination lasted but a short time longer. All the witnesses having given in their testimony, the prosecuting attorney rose to inform the court that, though there can scarcely be a doubt left in the mind of any one here that the man Broadwell who fled was the criminal, yet the prisoner here had not proven to his satisfaction that she was not accessory to the crime. The testimony, he reasoned, showed plainly that she had become acquainted with her husband's faithlessness; and her visit to Miss Harrington, begging her to spare him, is too significant an act to be entirely overlooked. Taking all things in consideration, he deems it his duty to advise the honorable court to bind the lady over. 
                  The judge, who had been silent during the whole investigation, now gave his opinion. He confessed that the testimony was not such as to justify him in releasing the prisoner; and though he regretted the necessity of the step his duty as judge of the examining court enjoined upon him to take, he must hold the prisoner over in the sum of two thousand dollars, to appear before the criminal court. 
                  All was quiet; not a breath stirred for a moment to break the ominous silence. The judge rose from his chair, the clerks rose from their chairs, the reporters rose from theirs, the lawyers also got on their feet, which was followed by a general exit of the spectators, and in less than five minutes the court-room was deserted, and no one but an officer and Hannah were left. 
                  The former approached the latter, who was still sitting on the prisoners' bench, and tapped her on the shoulder. 
                  "Come along." 
                  She had been looking down, and must have been unconscious of his presence, who knows? perhaps also of her own, for she had been entirely startled by his touch. 
                  She looked up now, her pale face raised to his, never saying a word. 
                  "Come along;" and the broad palm of his hand was once more laid upon her shoulders. 
                  Again she shrank within herself, but this time the blood rushed to her cheeks, and anger flashed from her eyes. 
                  "How dare you-" 
                  She was not allowed to finish the sentence. The officer of the law was not accustomed to such language. The privilege of using hard words were denied to all save the policemen. Therefore, he simply said: "Hold your tongue, and come along." 
                  He took hold of her by the arm, and dragged her from her seat. Poor Hannah was now fully awake to her position. She resisted no longer, but tried to make her way to the door toward which the officer rather pulled than led her. The color had left her wan cheeks again, and despair was once more written, only still more plainly than before, upon her features. "Where are you taking me?" trembled on her blue lips. 
                  "Never mind. You'll see by and by." 
                  "O, tell me, where are you taking me?" And she stopped and raised her sad, anxious face to his. The only answer she received was another pull forward, and "to jail, as a matter of course." 
                  "To jail?" she replied almost in a whisper, and shuddered from head to foot. "O, not to jail, O, not to jail-I can not go to jail." 
                  "We'll see about that." 
                  He was just in the act of using violence in compelling her to go with him, when the door opened and one of the clerks who had attended court came in with a paper which he handed over to the officer, saying at the same time: 
                  "You can go home, madam; somebody went on your bond." 
                  The officer released his hold, and Hannah stood alone. The news did not remove the load from her heart, and her limbs, if any thing, shook more now than before. She wanted to move toward the door, from which she was scarcely one step apart, but felt herself too weak to accomplish the feat without a hold. She reached out her hand and supported herself on the door-knob. In this manner she reached the stone platform on the steps. But this was as far as she could go. She feared to risk another stile. They were covered with snow, but she didn't mind that. But right across the street, stood a trimmed-up policeman, with blue coat and yellow buttons, and whisky-bloated face, who did mind it. He fancied it his duty to drive every body away from the Court-house steps who were no police-lawyers, or some of their clients. And as Hannah had stood aloof from engaging the services of any one of them, he crossed over to where she sat, and told her to be off, and not to obstruct the way. So off she went, slowly walking over the snow, hearing nothing, seeing nothing, feeling nothing, reaching her home crushed and humiliated to the dust, with sensations known only to herself, and, as she imagined, to her God for evermore.

                              I HAVE deeply felt 
                              The mockery of the hollow shrine at which my spirit knelt, 
                              Mine is the requiem of years in reckless folly passed, 
                              The wall above departed hopes on a frail venture cast; 
                              The vain regret that steals above the wreck of squandered hours, 
                              Like the sighing of the autumn wind over the faded flowers.

                  THE morning of the 24th of February was ushered in with a drizzly rain. The weather had moderated considerably, and before the luncheon hour had expired most of the snow had disappeared both from the roofs of the houses and the ground. It was a very unpleasant day for pedestrians, for the pavements were slushy, and a heavy mist, like a stationary dark cloud, spread its murky gloom through the atmosphere. Reuben Armhold had breakfasted early, and was now on his way from the Gibson House, in which he had engaged a room for himself, to the dwelling of Mr. Montgomery. He had sent a porter twice on the preceding day for his trunks, but the old merchant had refused to hand them over, with the excuse that he had to see Mr. Armhold himself first. "Tell him I want him to call on me," he had sent him word. 
                  Reuben's first resolution had been not to comply, and rather leave every thing behind than visit once more the house in which his heart had sustained so serious a wound. But after he had duly reflected over the request, and remembered how kindly and generously he had been treated by Mr. Montgomery himself, he changed his mind, and, as we see, was on his way to make that last call. 
                  He soon reached the house. The bell was answered by a servant, who informed him that Mr. Montgomery had gone out, but that Miss Nellie wanted to see him herself. She begged him, therefore, to "please walk into the drawing-room." 
                  Reuben, however, seemed to have no inclination of meeting his former intended, so he simply requested the servant to inform her master that he had been here, and not having found him at home, hoped that his trunks would be sent to him at the Gibson House. The servant said that she would tell every word to her master as soon as he came home, but since her young mistress-Miss Nellie-had particularly instructed her not to let Mr. Armhold go away if he should call, and which he did, she would have to beg him once more to "please walk into the drawing-room." 
                  "Not now," was all he replied, then turned around to leave. Just then, and before he had had time to advance a step, he heard his name called in a voice that had once been music to his soul. For a moment he stood there undecided, his face averted from Nellie. Should he go in and hear what she had to say, or should he deny her the privilege of another word? He had no time to come to a conclusion. Nellie had ran forward and now stood by his side begging him to step in. He looked at her for a moment, then his lips curled in bitterness, and he made a step forward to leave. Nellie saw it and trembled. Her face turned ashy white, and her breath came faster. She had been praying for this moment for four and twenty hours, and now having arrived, it threatened to slip away from her unimproved. She was determined it shouldn't slip away. "You shan't leave, Reuben-no, you shan't," she said, hurriedly, stepping right in front of him, and tremblingly holding on to his coat sleeve. "You've got to go in and hear me, then you can leave if you have a mind to," and as he still stood there undecided, added, "Reuben, if you haven't a heart of stone, you'll hear me-come in," and he suffered himself to be pulled into the drawing-room. 
                  Arrived there she at once threw her arms around his neck, and began to weep. It hadn't the desired effect. Reuben's heart was not in a condition to be moved. As his thoughts wandered back at that moment to his last interview with her in his own room, when he had appealed to her, aye, upon his knees to trust him, and not spurn him away from her; when he had begged her to have pity on him as he had never begged his hardest task-master, under the hardest labor, at Sing-Sing, a frown shot across his brow, and he almost felt like thrusting her from him. But he curbed his passion and used no violence. He was determined to act the gentleman since he had entered the room, and therefore freed himself from her embrace, employing no greater force than he found necessary to remove her arms. 
                  "You forget yourself, Miss Montgomery," he said. "What do you want of me?" 
                  "Reuben-Mr. Armhold, how can I atone for the wrong I have done? Tell me, Reuben," and the sobs became more frequent, "tell me, Reuben, will you forgive me?" 
                  He did not answer her for some time, for all the evil passions of his tempestuous nature were roused in his bosom. All he could do was to look down upon her with an expression of bitterness in his face he took little pains to conceal. 
                  "No!" he said at last, his voice shriller than she had ever heard it before,-"no, I shall not forgive you. And if this is all you wanted to see me for, I just as lief might go away now, for I have no longer the least desire to look into your face." 
                  Nellie was not a woman altogether without spirit; she could raise enough of it at the proper emergency. She had not been of the opinion that Reuben could be reconciled at once, but she never suspected him capable of using such language to her. Therefore, after she had wiped the tears from her eyes, and raised her head proudly erect, she said: 
                  "I was a fool to call you in, sir. Any person knowing you as well as I do, would not have taken the pains to humble herself before you. I had done you injustice; and having found out my error, and having repented of it, deemed it my duty to ask you for your pardon. You were pleased not only to deny it, but also to add remarks intended to wound. If you have no longer any desire to look into my face, I presume the briefer our interview the more satisfactory it will be to your wishes. I have no hesitancy in saying," and here tears, against her own will, stood in the corner of her eyes, "that I have wronged you deeply, and that simply a feeling of foolish jealousy had made me forget myself so much as to spurn you from my sight. I know, sir, by the manner in which you have met my expressions of regret, that your love for me has died out, and, though I know that I shall never more see a happy hour on account of its loss, I am willing to relinquish all claim to it, if you will only say that you will pardon me, and bear me no ill-will for the sin I committed against you." 
                  "You are right to call it a sin, Miss Montgomery," he said, advancing a step, and riveting his dreamy black eyes to her face. "Yes, sin is the proper word for it. To steal from a man his heart-the richest jewel nature endowed him with-and then trample on it, is, to my belief, the greatest crime you could have been guilty of. I do not speak to you now excitedly, and, had you not led the conversation into that channel, I should not have done so. But since we are at it, and as this will be the last time, in all probability, that I shall ever speak to you upon this or upon any other topic, I will reserve nothing from your ears, so you may better understand the man whom you have robbed of his whole, whole future. No, Miss Montgomery, you needn't fear that I will insult you now; you can sit down and rest easy that I shall remember in whose presence I am." 
                  Nellie sat down, covering up her face with a handkerchief. 
                  "From the moment, Miss Montgomery," he continued; "that you promised to be mine, and you whispered into my ears that you loved me, I imagined-I do not speak now like a silly boyish lover," he interrupted himself-"that I had been transplanted into a paradise. You did not know, nor do you know yet, how much I had endured, and how lonely I had felt on earth, before I came into your father's house, and was looked upon by him as one of his family. The vividest description could not impress your mind with the full force of the feelings engendered in the bosom of him who stands alone on earth. Remember, when I came to you, it was as a grown-up orphan, as an isolated being, having not a solitary heart in whom to confide, or to call my own. What can you know, were your sensibility ever so refined, of the feelings of the wretch who has no body he can call one of his? Not taking in account all my past suffering, I arrived in this city to find myself bereft of father, mother, brother, yes, of every thing that can be dear to man. I saw you, and my heart, my whole, undivided heart went out to you, and you made me believe that you cared for the love that lay pure and unclaimed within. What cared I now for all the world? Nothing. You had smiled upon me, and I was happy. Now look, Miss Montgomery, what you have made of me! Do you know that the night of the 22d of February has robbed me of this earth's citizenship, and converted me into an enemy of all mankind? Say, what's left for me to do now? I can't enjoy life any longer, and I shall find no rest this side of the grave. I have ceased to be a boy so I could forget the past. You were my all--" 
                  "O, let me be it still!" she interrupted him, amid tears, and threw herself upon her knees before him. "Reuben, Reuben, I love you from my whole heart, more now than ever, and if you will but take me back I will become your slave forever." 
                  "No, Miss Montgomery," he replied, considerably moved, "I do not want you to become my slave. My feelings are reversed. I worshiped you once, girl, and would have died for you had my death been calculated to increase your happiness. But now, now, Miss Montgomery, that old love has died out in me, and though you are as beautiful as ever, and though your form has not lost the least of its symmetry, and your soft blue eyes look down upon me with the same innocent glance that had once the power to fascinate me, my interest for you is dead, and belongs to the things that are past and gone. Miss Montgomery, now rise to your feet, and let me depart. Had you not spurned me as you did-remember, I was upon my knees before you, begging you to have confidence in me only for a day longer-remember, only for one day longer-" 
                  "O, do not refer to it, unless you want to afflict me still more," she interrupted him. 
                  "You are right, Miss Montgomery. It were folly to refer to it now. My heart is broken, and there is nothing left for me to do-" 
                  "But to forgive me-" 
                  "But to forgive you, then go forth an altered and a much wiser man." 
                  He bowed, and as he left the room, Nellie imagined to have seen a tear in his eye. And if it had not been for that tear, to hide which he had lowered his head-almost burying it between the lapels of his overcoat-he might have seen, at a short distance from him, two persons-a lady and a boy-who had been standing, as if on guard, before Mr. Montgomery's mansion ever since he had entered it-slowly following his footsteps through the several streets he had to pass in order to reach his hotel. 
                   
                  He was still something like four squares from the Gibson House, feeling considerably out of humor, his eyes still turned down upon the slushy pavement, when Reuben fancied to hear his name pronounced-though scarcely above a whisper-very close behind him. Thinking that some persons who knew him were speaking of him, he paid no attention to it whatever, but kept up his brisk walk without as much as to turn his head to see who they were. But when shortly after, and that before he had proceeded twenty steps further, the same voice, only a little more tremulous than before, whispered his name, he raised his face, halted, and looked back. But a step behind him, leading her little Emil by the hand, stood Hannah Broadwell, her pale, transparent and emaciated face, resignation written in every line of it, modestly raised to that of the man whose brother she had so shamefully wronged. 
                  "Pardon me, sir," she said, "for stopping you on the street." She wanted to add something else, but her tongue denied her its further service. 
                  Something in the expression of her face softened Reuben's heart toward her. She was no longer the proud, haughty woman he had known years ago, and as his eyes took in that wreck-for she was nothing more than a wreck from what she had been-somehow the image of his own dead mother came before his mind, and infused him with a spirit of pity. 
                  "What is it you wish of me?" he inquired. 
                  "I should like to see you in private for a few moments," she pleaded, hardly able to repress her tears. "May I follow you to your rooms?" 
                  "No, no, not to my rooms," he replied; "but, if it suits you, I shall call at your house sometime during the evening." 
                  "I can not ask that much of you, sir, but if you will come-" 
                  "I have said so." 
                  And he was as good as his word. The clock was just striking two when he entered the room in which Hannah, with her children around her, was seated near a feebly-fed coal-fire in the hearth. 
                  "Will you be seated, sir?" she said, then whispered a few words into Emil's ear, who, a moment later, coaxed his little sisters and brothers to follow him into the kitchen. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she continued, after she was alone with him, "I have understood that if it had not been for you I should have been remanded to jail. You have had a sweet revenge, sir. But tell me, O, tell me, sir, what will become of me?" 
                  The poor woman raised her cotton apron to her face and wept. 
                  "I entertain not the least fears of your acquittal," he said, in order to console her, though he had his doubts about it. "Your total innocence of this crime will be established long before the month shall have expired. It is no easy matter to convict a person of murder; and it requires more proof than your being found in the same room with the slain, to substantiate the charge of murder." 
                  "But if they should convict me," she sobbed, "what would become of my children?" 
                  "Mrs. Broadwell, you shall not be convicted. The innocent shall not suffer for the guilty. You shall not be taken away from your children. I shall see you successfully defended." 
                  "And shall I never more have to go before court?" 
                  "No." 
                  She left the small wooden bench upon which she sat, and threw herself prostrate upon the floor, kissing Reuben's feet. 
                  "Get up, madam," he said, considerably embarrassed; "I am not fond of such demonstrations." 
                  "O, let me lie here and weep at your feet," she sobbed, tears of anguish coursing down her cheeks. "It will do me good, I know it will. Are you not my Edgar's brother, before whom I may lighten my heart? I am so unhappy-O, how unhappy!" 
                  The wretched woman kept on in this manner for some time, and Reuben listened to her without interruption. At last she rose to her feet, wiped the tears from her red, swollen eyes, and returned to her seat. Now she spoke to him of her utter destitution, that she and her children were almost starving, how she had tried from day to day to get employment, but had never been able to earn enough to buy even the necessaries of life. And as Reuben listened to this tale of woe, and looked at the fragile form of that greatly injured woman, who despite all her faults, had inherited from nature a nobility which, even in the hours of her greatest trials, spoke through her every word and act, his heart hardened toward the man who had been the evil genius alike of Edgar, Carrie, Lionel, Hannah and himself. At this moment he forgot, or at least thought not, of the hatred he had nurtured in his own bosom against Mrs. Broadwell. His whole mind was embittered against her husband, and much would he have given for the power and opportunity of revenging himself on the miserable wretch for the blight he had cast around all those he had come in contact with. 
                  "Mrs. Broadwell," he said, all the wrongs he had endured freshly revived in his mind, and lending his features an unusually hard expression, "I am willing to raise you from your fallen state, ameliorate your pecuniary condition, exert all my influence and power to establish your innocence beyond the faintest doubt, take it upon myself to provide for you in the future, if you promise-" and here he paused for a moment, "yes, if you promise-" this with a seriousness that sent an icy chill through Hannah's frame, "to reveal to me the present whereabouts of your husband." 
                  This question, though it embarrassed her to no little extent, did not take her by surprise. She expected that he would ask for her husband. She could in all truth say that she knew not his hiding place, but would Mr. Armhold believe her words? Would he not think her trying to deceive him? And would he not withhold from her then, the assistance without which, the truth of which she could not for a moment banish from her mind, she would find herself placed at the verge of distraction. She thought of seeing herself once more before the bench of justice, all those hardened faces staring down upon her; imagined to hear herself convicted of the crime of which she stood accused, saw herself hurried to prison, an iron door closed behind her, and her children-it grew dizzy all around her, and she had to close her eyes, until that weakness, which to her great relief lasted but for a moment, subsided once more. 
                  "Mr. Armhold," she replied, nerving herself to the task, for she felt the necessity of not displeasing the only man who had promised bread for her little ones, "I am a wife and mother, with obligations God and nature have imposed upon me. How hard I have striven to be true to them it will not become me to say. I have committed but one crime-a crime for which, I fear, I am now suffering-and it consists in the manner I have treated my little Emil's father. O, do not think that I have not repented of it a thousand times, and begged our heavenly Judge to have pity on my soul. There is scarcely a day, an hour, a moment, but what I think of my Edgar, who was too good for me. O, God! he never would have left his wife had he known the sufferings that awaited her-O! I must not think of it." 
                  She could not continue. Her heart was too full Again that apron was raised to her face to receive the tears gushing from her eyes. Reuben respected her grief, and watched her in silence. Thus bowed down and humiliated he had seen his mother many, many years ago. She had long since joined her kindred in that other world in which the good are supposed to receive the reward they never find on earth, but her sainted image again floated, like a vision of peace, before his eyes, and, much as he had endured in this world since her death, and hardened as his nature had become through his contact with his fellow-men, he felt like weeping himself at that moment. 
                  "Madam," he said, at the first sign she gave of being more composed, "we all have had our sorrows. It will not do to brood over them forever. It would but make us mad, and thereby add another joy to the achievements of the destroyers of our peace. All the satisfaction left for the injured must be found in revenge. It is the only thing that keeps me alive now, and to obtain which-for we have one common enemy, Mrs. Broadwell-I call upon you not to deny me the information I have begged you to grant me. Do not think for a moment that I have asked you to do something your duty as wife should spurn. The man you call your husband is our common enemy. He has destroyed my happiness; he has destroyed yours. His life is forfeited to the State as his soul to the arch-fiend of the human race. Reveal to me his hiding-place, for only on that condition will I save you from your pending troubles." 
                  Hannah wiped her eyes dry, then suffered the apron to fall back over the few folds of her scant gown. 
                  "I can not tell you where he is, Mr. Armhold, for he left his home without the least warning or information. But even if I knew where he was, I should sooner die, aye, and see my children die also, than betray his confidence. What matters it if he did prove himself unworthy of the name of husband, father, man, I am still his wife, sir, my children are still his children, and all the crimes on his part will not justify me to forget my obligations-my oath! I have sworn to be faithful to him unto death, and starvation even staring in the face of my children as it does, and the dangers to which I am exposed, and will in all probability overtake me, can not induce me, hard as it would be for me to see my little ones in their death-agonies, to perjure myself and become the accuser of their own father. Though tried as never wife and mother was tried before, I shall not lose my faith in heaven and our merciful God can not want me to save myself by doing a wrong." 
                  The poor woman lowered her head and watched her bony fingers as they nervously played amid the folds of her dress. She had spoken from her own heart, and felt that soothing spirit steal over her the conviction of right ever leaves behind it. But Reuben, as he watched her thoughtfully, compressed his lips, and a scowl was seen upon his brow. 
                  "Mrs. Broadwell," he commenced, something like a sneer in the tone of his voice, and while his eyes were riveted upon the pale face that was now raised to his, "you have spoken nicely-aye, spoken the very sentiments of my own heart. A wife should ever think of her oath, and sooner endure all wrongs than court the wrath of heaven by abusing the confidence the husband reposes in her. But tell me, madam, how am I to understand your words while they conflict with your acts? Or is it perhaps part of the principles inculcated in your heart that the same laws are not binding on the wife when her husband should perchance be of the Jewish race? I know that my brother was a faithful ful husband-you did not act out your principles then; no oath, no obligation was too sacred then to be broken. He was simply a Jew, and toward a Jew, though he was a man every inch of him, you had reserved the right to act unfeelingly. You were blind then to all those moral virtues which this knave, thief, and murderer was able to awaken in your bosom. Madam, I am sorry that I can not enter at this instance in the spirit of your words, and exalt myself so much above my selfishness as to forget my own private wrong in the admiration I am ready to acknowledge to feel for the position you deem it your duty to occupy. Mrs. Broadwell, I will also do you the justice of accrediting sincerity to your words, and therefore will not urge you, even if I knew you possessed the knowledge of your husband's whereabouts, to reveal it to me. Only one thing I shall ask of you now which, in the name of Edgar Armhold, whom you have deeply wronged, I call upon you to promise me, aye, swear to me sacredly to observe." 
                  There was a time when Hannah could have listened to these and even worse accusations without any visible effects of being moved by them. But she was no longer the woman we have known her to be years ago. Pride, courage, fortitude, and every other feeling that could have nerved the spirit, had long since forsaken her, and often did she wonder at the change that had taken place within her. Poor, forsaken being! she was humbled to the dust, and wounded to the core. If there never was a woman as proud as she, there also never was one who had to pay so dearly for that pride. Honored, and esteemed, and courted, as she had been, she was now friendless, disgraced, and reduced to the extremest penury. Scarcely with sufficient clothing to shield her and her children from the effects of this cold, inclement weather, and with not half a bushel of coal in the house to keep up the fire, and with no money to purchase a further supply when these were used up, and not as much as a crumb of bread in the cupboard-thinking over this she had been listening to the bitter taunts she was so little prepared to receive. So tears came once more to her relief, and long after Reuben had ceased to address her, her face was still hid in her apron, and sobs were still rising from her breast. 
                  "Mrs. Broadwell," he continued, after he had observed a long pause, and made himself ready to take his leave, "have you not been listening to me? I beg you to abstain from weeping, until I have told you what I demand of you." 
                  She raised her head, and he continued: 
                  "I want you to renounce, and this upon oath, all claims Mr. Broadwell has upon you as your husband. Also swear to me never more to allow him a resting-place by your side. That you will ignore his existence and change your own name. That you will never let him cross your own threshold, nor suffer your children to call him their father. To all this I want you to swear; and though I do not believe that he will ever return to you again, I would fain, as far as you are concerned, have that return made impossible to him." 
                  "Mr. Armhold, I know that my husband does not love me, else he would have spared his wife the necessity of listening to a request to refuse his rightful claims. But how, I ask you," Hannah continued, "can you demand of me to deny the father of my children, and bar the door against him should he ever feel inclined to return to me again? No, Mr. Armhold, I can not promise you this; and though I must see all my hopes depart with you, in the name of God go and tempt me not into wrong." 
                  So saying, she rose from her seat and walked across the room, but there was no longer any dignity in her gait, any grace in her movement. She stationed herself in front of the window looking down upon the narrow, dark yard, and wet the panes with her tears. 
                  Reuben also left his seat, and, as she heard him advance toward the door, a pang shot through her heart. It was to her as if the sun was setting for ever; as if the last streak of light was departing and utter darkness was stealing all around her. She could not let him go away without another appeal. Necessity knows no law, and a mother knows no limits to her duties to her children. She left the window, and hurried to the door through which Reuben was just emerging. She stopped him at once, and begged him, with tears in her eyes, not to forsake her thus. With an eloquence and pathos her despairing heart lent her tongue, she pleaded upon her knees, and with arms raised heaven ward, the cause of her children. "They are starving," she cried, "and I have nothing to give them. O, let not your Edgar's wife plead to you in vain. Help me! help me! In the name of all that's holy, help me!" 
                  She threw herself upon the floor, twined her arms around his feet, and sobbed aloud. He freed himself from her hold, dropped something from his hands, then stepped through the door without giving another look backward. When Hannah rose to her feet she discovered a well-filled pocket-book lying on the small deal-table. 
                  Reuben had revenged himself. 
                  Hannah did not ask herself long whether the pocket-book had been left intentionally or by accident. It was there-right there before her eyes-filled with bank notes of all denominations, and never did a miser look more greedily upon his glittering stores than did Hannah on the treasure lying within her reach. Quickly she snatched it from the table and hid it in her pocket. Her children should have something to eat now-they had fasted nearly for four and twenty hours-a little feast she would make for them, and she hurried from the room, went to the baker, went to the grocer, went to the butcher, went to the coal-dealer, and in less than an hour her little ones were comfortably seated around a good fire, watching their mother preparing their supper for them. She had already given them milk and cakes, and now their happy voices filled the room with laughter. Night stealthily crept on, the table was set, and the steaming viands placed upon it. The little children took their seats on each side of their mother, and, after saying grace, began to still their appetite. 
                  Hannah gazed upon them and was happy. God had heard her prayer and sent her bread. Tears of gratitude coursed down her cheeks, and with a mother's pride she looked at the smiling faces of her little young ones, who, with the exception of the sickly Emil, ate like so many hungry wolves. On the morrow she would go once more to Reuben Armhold. Something told her that he would hear her, and, for Edgar's sake and that of his child, help her through her trials. A strange peace pervaded her spirit, and the heavy load that had weighed down her heart seemed gradually to grow lighter, and something of a hope-something indistinctly bright-awoke in her mind, and lent a holy, undefiled light to her eyes. 
                  Thus hour after hour passed by. The children became sleepy, she undressed them one after another, then put them to bed. The fire was still brightly burning in the grate; she extinguished the light of the tallow-candle standing on the table, then seated herself before the hearth, and placing her head upon her arm, looked thoughtfully at the yellow flames. It struck nine, it struck ten, it struck eleven and she still sat there, still looked at those flames and listened to the breathing of her innocent children. At last she rose from her seat, stole to the other side of the room, and opened a closet, out of which she extracted a book. 
                  It was the bible. 
                  She went back to her seat and began to read in the book of Job. Tears fell from her eyes, but they were tears wrung from a contrite heart, believing in the grace and mercy of a heavenly Father. Thus she sat until there was no longer any fire in the hearth. She kissed the book and put it back in the closet. A peaceful resignation made her feel happy. All was so still, but nothing more so than her own conscience. Now she stole to the bedside of her children to see whether they were fast asleep. She straightened the cover and threw her shawl also over them so they might not catch cold. 
                  It struck one, then all was still again. She waited a moment, then moved to one corner of the room and let herself down upon her knees, and with face and arms raised heavenward, opened her heart to her maker, and breathed a long and fervent prayer to the God of mercy. 
                  It struck two, and she rose to her feet strengthened in spirit. Now she would retire and seek repose. But just then she fancied to hear a stealthy step approach her door. She listened for a moment, then turned pale. 
                  "Hannah!" 
                  It was only a whisper, but it was that of her husband, and she recognized it at once. Her heart began to beat fast, and her knees commenced to shake. She opened the door, and let him enter. "Good God!" fell from her lips, then she lighted the candle, and her eyes rested upon a being, whose appearance was hideous and terrible to behold. Broadwell, ragged and still bearing the marks of blood upon his tattered garments, stood there shaking from head to foot, his eyes wildly protruding from their sockets, his cheeks ashy and sunken, his lips blue and parched, and his thin hair stiff and shaggy. 
                  "Bread! bread! I am starving! Bread! bread!" he uttered in a faint voice. 
                  Hannah rushed for a chair, but, as she returned with it, a wild scream escaped her lips. 
                  A stranger had entered. 
                  Reuben Armhold, with eyes that were flashing fire, looked down upon her husband, and, while a wicked smile gave his face a fierce and demoniac expression, griped him by the collar, and hissed into his ear: 
                  "Clarence! Grim Castaway will be even with you now!" 
                  Before that sound had died away in the stilly air, Broadwell's hair had turned as white as snow!

                  RACHEL! 
                  
                     Crazy Rachel! 
                  If our readers will be patient for a moment, we will give them, as briefly as we can, the biography of "crazy Rachel"-the unfortunate woman, who for years had been known only by that appellation to the neighbors of Mr. John Harder, a daily laborer, in whose house, at the outskirts of the city of San Francisco, she had found, instead of an asylum, a prison-cell. 
                  In the year 18-there lived in the city of Louisville a certain Mr. Archibald Thornton, a prominent young lawyer, who, notwithstanding his lack in kindred, was, owing to his talents, education and manners, admitted in the very best of societies, and having had, in addition to these qualifications and acquirements, a very comely form and native grace, few were the young ladies indeed upon whom, if it was his intention to do so, he could not leave a favorable impression. It is true that he had the name of being a rake-the worst kind of a roue-but, strange as it may appear, the ladies, while they seemed to be shocked at the recital of some new transgression of his, simply liked him the better for it, and, while their parents advised them of the propriety of dropping his acquaintance, were seeking every opportunity possible to meet and come the more in contact with him. 
                  It was while he was thus in the hight of his glory and popularity that he became acquainted with Rachel Arnold, a beautiful brunette of fifteen summers, tall and graceful, with oval cheeks having the rich olive tint upon them; black eyes, in whose shy glances there seemed to slumber a fire that could give them, when kindled by love, an expression of an all-pervading lusciousness; a small Grecian nose, and a pair of deep-scarlet lips that now and then, as they would part in speech or smile, expose two rows of teeth which were almost as white as the virgin snow itself. She had come with her father from California to remain with some distant relatives of his, until he would have completed the business on whose account the journey had been made, and then to return with him again to their distant home across the Pacific. Little dreamed she then that ere she should see that home again her heart would be lost, and the child-girl would leave her relatives as a wife. 
                  And yet it was so. 
                  No sooner had she become acquainted with Archibald Thornton, and discovered the attention he was paying her, than her young heart, happy and delirious with a new feeling-a sensation she could no more comprehend than account for-opened to him, and all the rich treasures a blooming girl just budding into womanhood can lavish upon the man she loves, she would have laid at his feet had he felt inclined, as he had done so often before, to sacrifice innocence at the shrine of lust. Not because she was not pure, not because her heart was not as chaste as the ice upon a coral-reef, but because she loved with her whole existence and knew but one God, before whom to kneel-but one law to obey, and that was the will and word of Archibald Thornton. In her happiness, that bordered on ecstacy itself, she could listen to him for hours, and while sitting upon his knee, looking into his eyes, she wished no other heaven than feel the pressure of his passionate embrace, and the warmth of those lips as they fervently glued themselves to her own. She imagined him a superior being, a being to look up to, and often she would ask herself, as she mused over the change that had taken place in her life, whether she was worthy of such bliss. There was a peculiar reverence mixed with her love, and often when he would whisper some tender words, trivial in themselves, into her willing ear, she would feel like gliding down upon her knees and kiss his very feet. Fascinated by his looks, charmed by his speech, she lost her own individuality, and the enamored girl-woman, like the needle toward the north pole, was attracted toward the man who had gained so great a power over her. 
                  "O, Archibald," she whispered to him one day, as if afraid of her own voice, "you will always love me, and always call me your Rachel? Won't you, Archie?" 
                  A kiss upon her olive cheek, and with her youthful heart wildly beating in her bosom, she would, with her head reclining upon his manly breast and with her beautifully rounded arms twined around his neck, listen to his tender vows, and inscribe them in the colors of life-sweetening hope upon the still virgin-pure tablets of her memory. 
                  Thus the wooing. Her father's consent had been obtained for their marriage. Rachel Arnold, before she had reached her sixteenth anniversary, celebrated her wedding-day. Arrangements were made for an early departure for California, and, as soon as Mr. Arnold was through with his business, Mr. Archibald Thornton and his fond and doting wife left with him for their far-off home upon the Pacific. For a short time our married couple took up their residence with her father and stepmother, and lived happy together. Mr. Arnold lived in a small town near fifty miles from San Francisco, but a short distance from the gold-mines in which he owned the principal shares, and which yielded him an immense annual revenue. But as this was too narrow a field for the intelligence and acquirements of Mr. Thornton, and as his young wife had never been a great favorite of her stepmother, they moved to San Francisco on the following spring. Two years later Rachel had the happiness of presenting her husband, after a severe illness and a long confinement, with a daughter. The father was happy, and seemed to be proud of his swarthy female heir; but the mother was compelled to see her child given up to a set-nurse, for she was not able to still it. Here her first great grief commenced, and long before the physician declared her strong enough to leave her sick couch, symptoms of a weakening of her mind, of violent, but short as they were violent, fits of madness were discovered, and apprehensions were felt for the safety of the child, which she insisted should always linger by her side. In this manner a whole year passed by, when Mr. Thornton brought home one day a Miss Lucretia Broadwell-a lady who had been highly recommended to him-as a companion, so he informed his servants, for his wife. Mrs. Thornton, who had been gradually mending, and whose fits of lunacy had been of late less frequent and of shorter duration, all at once took a relapse, and daily grew more dangerous to the peace of the house. The servants, as they would sit in the hall, more than once whispered to one another that Mr. Thornton was a heartless man, as he showed no sympathy for his ailing wife; that some of them had frequently found him use harsh language to her, even call her by disrespectful names. Others ventured to remark that Miss Broadwell was not precisely what a good and honest companion to a sick woman should be, and that she took decidedly more pains to please Mr. than Mrs. Thornton. And then others again would add that their sick mistress was jealous, and had a right to be; for blind would be the person who could not observe the more than censurable conduct of a man who had a wife, although she be sick, toward a young lady who seemed all too ready to receive his advances-"yes, advances," they would add with emphasis and indignation, "which any modest woman would shun as the very temptation of the evil one himself." 
                  Whether there was any truth in these broad assertions and allegations we will not take it upon ourselves to answer, but the desire of Mr. Thornton to obtain a divorce from his wife on the ground of lunacy, which was subsequently granted, and his marriage shortly afterward with Miss Lucretia Broadwell, would lead one to suppose that the charges of his servants had not been entirely without any foundation. 
                  Why spin out a tale so long? 
                  Broken-hearted, and shattered in mind and body, she was sent home by her heartless husband to her father, informing him in his letter the causes that had forced him to take this irrevocable step. Mr. Arnold bore the name of being a very clever-yes, clever is the proper word-gentleman. He was a church member, belonged to several benevolent institutions, and his name always figured very conspicuously upon all lists for benevolent or other purposes, whenever there was the least likelihood of gaining a certain popularity by it. People respected him, for he was one of the wealthiest men in the country, and was always ready, provided he could obtain an office by it, to enter and encourage any enterprise. It is true that the confidence people were now reposing in him was only of a recent date, for as long as his first wife, who was a Jewess, had lived, he was somewhat under a social ban, but his second wife, a good orthodox Christian, wiped out all shame and dishonor attached to his first marriage, and reinstated him again in the good opinion of his neighbors. Now no greater wound could have been inflicted upon the pride of this precious couple than the return of Rachel as the discarded and divorced wife of Archibald Thornton. 
                  They did not feel mortifled and angry at Rachel's husband for his heartless conduct, but instead of it they felt a kind of shame in having a crazy woman added to their household. The reception the poor woman-poor, weeping Rachel-received from her parents can better be imagined than described; we will therefore simply state that from the moment she had returned she was confined in solitary imprisonment, and without the least consolement, to an attic room, which she never more left until arrangement had been made for her removal, by the direction of her former husband, who was ordered to provide for her, to a private asylum, while her little girl-motherless and fatherless-was shortly after sent by Mr. Arnold to his first wife's father-to Rachel's grandfather, who was living then in Cincinnati, and whom our readers have known as Joseph Joseph, by whose instruction, having been unable to provide for the child himself, Mr. Norton, the brother of Mrs. Arnold, brought little Ruth to the house of the Armholds. 
                  In the mean time poor Rachel was removed from asylum to asylum, but she frequently made her escape to the great mortification of her former husband, before whose door she would always knock for admittance, so he made up his mind to put the ocean between them, and for that purpose she was taken by him in company of his young brother-in-law-Clarence Broadwell, who intended to remove East to study for the ministry-to the city of New York, where Reuben Armhold, in his flight from Cincinnati, so strangely met the mother of little Ruth, and on account of which, the wretches who had had charge of her, having feared exposure, had caused his imprisonment in Sing Sing. 
                  Mr. Thornton soon found a place for his wife in the Lunatic Asylum of the State of New York. Believing himself rid of this burden, as he thought, forever, he bade farewell to Clarence and again left for home, once more to be invaded, one year later, while he was seated at breakfast one morning, by Rachel, who stood at his door, sane in mind though fragile in form, asking for her child-for her little Ruth. We believe if he had then deigned to give her a satisfactory answer, the poor and forsaken woman would have returned in peace, never more to trouble him, but live as happy as a mother in possession of a good and innocent child, and in the faith of an all-pervading mercy, can live apart from the father who has disowned and the husband who has discarded her. But thus it was not to be. Mr. Thornton had her at once arrested as an escaped lunatic, then looked out once more for a place of confinement from which, he hoped from all his heart, she would not be likely to escape again. After several days' inquiry he congratulated himself on his success in having found such a place. By the conversation he had had with Mr. Harder, who had once worked on his mines, and by what he knew of the character of the man, he felt assured that Rachel once in his clutches would as soon learn to fly as to flee from that prison-cell. According to agreement she was at once taken to Mr. Harder's house, to be in the future under the personal supervision of Mrs. Harder. This act did the damnable work. Rachel, bereft of all hope and sympathy, among a set of beings who were as feelingless as they were ignorant, and who had never learned as much as to read or write their own names, once more relapsed in her old sickness, and her mind, with the exception of very brief intervals of lucidity, became once more wandering, and she was kept imprisoned in a small room at the back of the house, the window of which looked down upon a side street, where she would now and then arrest the attention of the neighbors by her frantic shrieks and unearthly wild laughter. 
                  The children would watch her for hours, and she would open the window, protected by iron bars, and talk to them in her wild, delirious way, and be the biggest child among them. They would throw things up to her, and she would throw them back to them in a playful mood, taking as much interest in the game as if her whole life depended upon it. At other times she would not show herself near the window for weeks, and, could the curious have seen in her dirty cell, they might have discovered her lying or sitting upon a mat of straw, vaguely staring at vacancy, as if her very eyes were riveted upon some object living only in her imagination. At other times they could have seen her weep-weep bitter, burning tears, crying unto her God to release her from this unearthly bondage and take her to her far-off home; and then again they could have seen her eyes shoot forth a wild, unnatural fire, her lips covered with a frothy foam, as she would vent her curses upon her husband, upon her father and upon all the world. Then again she would be in a happier mood, and they could have seen her laugh and talk to herself, and to her little Ruth as if she were seated by her side, or find her singing, at the top of her compass, without the least coherency, songs of her youth. 
                  Thus passed by ten long, long years, and beautiful, olive-tinted Rachel had grown haggard, lean and bony. She had been fed on worse than offal; things cats and dogs would leave untouched, potato-pealing, cabbage-roots, and worse than these, had been her daily fare for years, and scarcely had a day passed by without feeling upon her back the stripes of the lash of those heartless wretches who had her in custody. Mr. Thornton had never in all these long years done more than sent his stipulated pay to Mr. Harder; but Mr. Arnold, the man who disgraced the name of father, condescended to call upon her keeper, whenever he came to the city, and that was once or twice every three years, and inquire into the health of the "girl" as he would call her, or even go to see her through the window, but, as it chanced never found her on such occasions, in a state of lucidity. He would simply leave a few dollars with Mr. Harder, enjoining upon him to take good care of his charge, then leave again. 
                  It had been now something like three years since his last visit, and one day he informed his youthful wife that he had some business in San Francisco, and would therefore take his departure in a few days. Bright and early on the following morning his coach was seen to leave his residence, winding its way down the valley, and taking him to the city on the coast. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER II. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              His hand did quake 
                              And tremble like a leaf of aspen green, 
                              And troubled blood through his pale face was seen, 
                              As it a running messenger had been. 
                           
                         
                        SPENSER'S FAIRY QUEEN. 
                      
                   
                  IT was very late that evening when Mr. Arnold's carriage entered the city of San Francisco. On inquiry of his driver where to stop, he simply answered that he wished to get out at the same hotel he had made his home during his last visit to the city, something like three years ago. The servant fully recollected the place, so, without offering any reply, applied the whip to the horses' backs, and fifteen minutes later deposited his employer before the California House. Mr. Arnold had himself conducted, after registering his name, to the room that was assigned to him, then ordered supper to be brought up (as he did not feel inclined to join the guests in the dining-room down stairs) in an hour. The porter retired without any further order, leaving the old gentleman to himself to doff his traveling attire, and make a hasty toilet. Mr. Arnold hadn't the least intention of leaving his hotel, or even his room, before the following morning; nevertheless, he took as much pains in donning his suit of fine black cloth, and in arranging his toilet, (although he was simply an old man whose business in the city, if he even had intended to transact it on this particular evening, required no such attention,) as if he were a courtier preparing for a conquest, impressed with the belief that upon his appearance his whole success with his lady-love depended. 
                  In justice to Mr. Arnold, we would remark that, to the many vices to which, owing to the influence he exerted by means of his wealth, either directly or indirectly, over the citizens of his own town and county, men of policy were willing to close both eyes and ears, the vice of truancy-of infidelity to his wife, who was, by-the-by, a very handsome, worldly young woman-could not be added. He was as faithful to his second love as the generality of old fools who, in their sear of life, when all the attraction is gone from them, fancy to possess the same power to fascinate, and command the self-same love and attachment they had so little deserved and still less appreciated in their youth. The attention Mr. Arnold was paying his toilet had a very peculiar reason-a reason which he but reluctantly acknowledged, and that but in the deepest recess of his own heart, to himself. The fact of the matter was, that he felt himself getting very old, and as that unpleasant and incontrovertible truth would, and that even against his own will, force itself upon his mind-who will not pardon him for it?-he felt a peculiar gratification, and an unaccountable consolation, in trying not only to deceive others, but likewise himself by the application of all means at his command, to make himself appear and imagine himself almost to feel younger. Notwithstanding his good living, his fine dinners, his fine suppers, his fine wines-notwithstanding his riches, his position in society, the honors that were paid him, the defference that was shown him-notwithstanding his healthy constitution-notwithstanding all this and more, Mr. Arnold was getting old-very old, and even as he looked now, dressed with all the care he could bestow upon his toilet, into the mirror before him, he fancied he detected sign after sign of decay even in those ruddy cheeks of which a youth of two-and-twenty might have been proud. All the attention bestowed upon the arranging of his white locks could no more conceal successfully the many and still increasing bald places of his pate, than his nice-fitting coat and pants, from the most fashionable merchant-tailor shop, could give his stiff and gouty figure the ease, grace and elasticity it had been gradually losing for the last five-and-twenty years. A sigh escaped him as the truth flashed across his mind that he had aged considerably of late. The additional wrinkles, like so many cuts that crossed and recrossed one another on his plump face, and divided his cheeks in so many squares of fat chunks, over which the closely-shaven skin flappily hung, seemed to mock his efforts to cheat the world and himself. Occupied with such and similar thoughts, he turned away from the mirror to take a look down upon the street from his window; but as it had grown entirely dark since his arrival he could see nothing, so he moved away with a dubious shake of his head, and took a seat by the fire in the grate-for it was early in October, and a heavy fog was pressing down the atmosphere-and patiently waited there for his supper. 
                  Many and varied are the thoughts that can and do arise in a man's mind in the space of one hour of solitary confinement, and there is no place and no time better calculated culated to set us a-thinking than a room in a strange house, occupied by us in the stilly hours of night. And Mr. Arnold was like the rest of us. But among all the thoughts that passed through his mind now, as he sat vaguely staring into the fire, there was not one in which the misery of his daughter-of crazy Rachel-lived even for a moment. She was to him as one whose place in his own heart and its affections had long since been taken up by another. He reflected, with the blind selfishness common to most natures, only over his own grievances-and what sadder grievance could one have than to be in love with earth and life, and have the knowledge of an early decay impressed upon us by so many unmistakable signs? He was therefore sadder than usual, and something akin to a feeling of gratitude awoke in his bosom for the waiter who, in serving his supper and arranging the plates on a small table, aroused him from a train of thoughts that were likely, if they had not been scattered and driven back, to follow him to his pillow and torment him in the shape of a very ugly dream. 
                  He got up from his seat by the hearth at once, and with something like relief sat down to his meal and heartily partook of it. He began to ask the boy who had remained to wait on him many trivial questions, and in this manner a light conversation ensued, in which Mr. Arnold-who was now all good humor, the looking-glass and the picture it had shown him being quite forgotten-seemed to take considerable interest. "Now bring me up a daily paper," he said, as he finally passed the napkin over his lips and left his chair by the table, to walk up and down the room with his hands meeting behind; "yes, bring me a daily paper and a good cigar-do you listen? a good cigar;" and the boy could still hear his hearty laugh after he had closed the door behind him and was moving along the passage. 
                  Both the paper and the cigar were brought. Mr. Arnold made himself more easy now. He took from his trunk a soft and comfortable sleeping-gown, and a pair of finely-worked velvet slippers. The waiter helped him to don them, then was dismissed with some "small change" for his labors. Mr. Arnold was alone at last; he raised the paper to his eyes and began to read, but soon his glance became uncertain, his head now inclined in this and now in that direction, and in less than fifteen minutes the paper dropped from his unsteady hands and he was fast asleep. It was by no means a romantic sleep, in which the sound that escaped his lips could be compared to the gentle breath of the May wind. He snored loud and lustily, and only an accidental noise, occasioned by the fall of something heavy upon the stone-passage in front of his own door, aroused him sufficiently to remember where he was and that he had lost more than two hours of the comforts and ease he might have had by retiring in time. He made up, however, for these lost hours by rising that much later than usual on the following morning. Consequently he came down too late for breakfast, but he had risen in good spirits, and fancied, after he had completed a lengthy toilet, and carefully arranged each separate article of his dress, which took something like two hours, that those traces which had made him feel so uneasy last night, had vanished from his face, and that he was looking as well and young yet as many a man who was not by twenty years as old as he. So he ordered a light breakfast to his room, which he relished with considerable appetite; and when he left the hotel a half hour later, dressed like a bridegroom, and vain as a peacock, he didn't dream that at the out-skirts of the city, in a dirty little room, scarcely eight by twelve, a woman who was his flesh and blood was literally starving, and was gnawing, while her eyes seemed to shoot from their sockets, the soles of her old and dirty shoes, in order to still her hunger. 
                  Little did he think, as he walked along the pavement, now shaking hands with this and now with that old acquaintance, that another hand was stretched out at that moment-stretched out over the cringing and wasted form of a being who had once called him by the tender name of father-stretched out by one of her own sex, by a woman who had promised to watch over the unfortunate one-stretched out not to greet her, not to caress her, but to apply the lash to her back that was still blue, bloody and swollen from the whipping she had received an hour before from John Harder himself, for having asked him to give her something to eat-some potato pealings or some cabbage-stalks. 
                  Mr. Arnold was all unconscious of this treatment to which unfortunate Rachel was just then, as she had been ever since she was confined in that cell, subjected, and when he, some few hours later, after the most of his business had been transacted, was admitted in John Harder's room by John Harder himself, who had not felt well enough to attend to his work that morning, and was received with that deference self-interest teaches the most brutish and overbearing individuals to observe toward those who fee them and from whose crib they eat, he was almost prepossessed in his favor-at least as much so as a man in Mr. Arnold's position can be prepossessed for a man in John Harder's position. 
                  The welcome being over, Mr. Arnold turned around to see whether he could espy something like a chair upon which he might venture to seat himself without soiling his clothes, and then, having satisfied himself that such a thing was quite impossible in this establishment, he drew a fine cambric handkerchief from his waist-pocket and passed it several times over the seat of the chair nearest to which he stood, then sat down upon it and asked how "the girl" was doing-how they were getting along with her. "Is she very troublesome to you?" he inquired, not because he took particular interest either in John Harder or his wife, but because he had some thing to say, and as this question just started to his mind, why not ask it? 
                  "Troublesome, you say?" John Harder, exclaimed, raising his eyebrows, and falling back a step, as if the question, coming from a man who had seen Rachel in her frequent fits of lunacy, greatly surprised him. "Troublesome, you say? Yes, Mr. Arnold, if I hadn't her in the house now, I should no more think of taking charge of her again, were you or Mr. Thornton to offer me three times the pay I'm getting now, than I would think of trying to tame a tiger." 
                  "Never mind, Mr. Harder," Mr. Arnold said, all the sympathy, as it generally happens, placed on the wrong side and with the wrong party, "I shall liberally reward you for the trouble you and your wife have had, and still may have with 'the girl.' I do not want you to take care of her for nothing. Before I go away I shall leave you some money." 
                  Thanks were profusely offered on one side, and equally as profusely acknowledged on the other, and the whole wound up with a request of Mr. Arnold to be conducted-no, not into the room Rachel occupied; he feared to come into close a proximity to her-but to a position from which he might be enabled to have a view of her. John Harder was ready to do so at once, and the two-father and keeper-left the room, ascended two flights of stairs, went first through one passage, then through another, until they arrived at its lower extremity where Mr. Arnold was requested to take up his position, while the other opened a door close by, exposing the interior of a small dark corner that was partitioned off for the exclusive benefit of poor Rachel, and was called "her room." Let us take a hasty survey of the premises and its inmate, before the door closes, perhaps never more to open either to our or to Mr. Arnold's view. 
                  Imagine to yourself a room, a very small room, perhaps no larger than eight by twelve, with walls that might have been white-washed once, but the present appearance of which indicated no such extravagance ever-at least not for the last ten years-to have been lavished upon them. They were dirty and dusty, and spider-webs hung down from the gloomy ceiling and stretched from corner to corner. A small window with iron bars was on one side, and the door on the other. Furniture this dingy room contained none. An old and torn mattress filled with straw lay upon the floor, and upon that mattress there sat a woman of something like six-and-thirty, who, unless closely observed, and even then she would be taken for ten years older, had the appearance of having reached her fiftieth year. As we look upon her-and as her father now looks upon her-her face is turned away from us. A shudder creeps through us as we behold that spare figure now, and remember it as we saw it some twenty years ago, reclining, with all the grace and elegance youth and nature had bestowed upon it, by the side of the man who had then promised to love and protect her forever, and who had since so rudely cast her aside. Her form is stooping over, and her long, bony arms are listlessly lying upon her lap. She is evidently unaware of being the object of observation, for now and then a word escapes her lips which none can understand. Her hands are always busy with the folds of her torn and ragged dress. John Harder inquires whether he should close the door again, and as his visitor replies that he would like to speak to Rachel a word or two, the woman raises her head, and looks around, while Mr. Arnold approaches. 
                  "Rachel! Rachel! do you know me?" 
                  She passed her hand over her forehead, and wildly stared at her father. For nearly two minutes her eyes were riveted to his face, then, as he repeated the question for the second time, she broke out in an unearthly shriek and jumped to her feet. But she did not approach the door from which Mr. Arnold was now slowly and apprehensively retreating. His voice, not heard for years, had at once been recognized by her as that of her father, and while she was still staring at him-staring at that splendidly dressed and well-fed old man, the past-and the disgraceful part he had taken in it-swept like a hurricane through her mind, stirring up within her the spirit imprisonment and the lash had kept down in dire subjection for many long, long years. Yes, as she stared at him, a reaction took place in her mind, and she was as sane and lucid as the man who was watching the frown that had settled upon her brow, giving her thin, haggard, weird-like features an expression so severe and terrible, that Mr. Arnold, afraid of an attack upon himself, moved several steps back. Rachel saw it, and as she loftily raised her head-a thing she had not done for years-an angry flush-a lurid light-shot from her coal black eyes, and her nerves, agitated beyond her own control, gave her features, now fearfully contracted, a diabolical expression. 
                  "Do you know me, Rachel?" he said at length. "I am your father." 
                  Good God! he her father! Wasn't it enough to make her mad on the instant. He her father! She could no longer restrain herself. Her heart seemed to burst for anger. She was sane now, and the recollection of the thousand wrongs and injuries to which she had so long been subjected, raised a tumult in her bosom. The blood-scarcely ever in a proper condition-now circulated through her throbbing veins like a stream of fire. She shook-such was her agitation-from head to foot. Her eyes gleamed dangerously, her brow contracted, her sunken cheeks turned to a lurid flame, and her greenish teeth, that once looked like polished ivory, gnashed while the seathing foam encircled her quivering lips. 
                  "You my father?" she shrieked, her thin, bony hands closing up in a hard, knuckly fist. "You my father? You? You? YOU? A curse upon you!" The waist of her dress burst from the dilation of her surging bosom. "A curse upon you! You my father! You! And this is the way to treat a daughter? This is the way? To starve her out? To starve her out? To keep her locked up and make her mad? And make her mad? Yes, yes, and make her m-m-m-a-d!" 
                  She was too exhausted to say more; for a moment an unusual tremor pervaded her whole being, then she dropped down upon the straw mat as if dead. 
                  "I presume I may close the door now?" John Harder said, with as much indifference as if he had witnessed simply a play to which its frequent repetition had long since made him accustomed. "Now, Mr. Arnold," he continued, after they had once more reached the room in the lower story, "this may give you a slight idea of the condition of your daughter's mind. If you have ever been of the opinion that time may cure her disease, I presume, after what you have just witnessed, you will relinquish it in despair. Don't you think she is stark mad?" 
                  Mr. Arnold tacitly assented to it; but if his facial expression was an index to his heart, there was something in the words she had addressed to him that left quite a different impression upon his mind. Though he did not acknowledge to himself even, that her accusations with which she had met him in such undisguised rage had the least foundation in reality, yet-yet he could not pass over it, though he strove hard to do so, with that phlegmatic indifference with which his callous nature had formerly treated the worst symptoms of Rachel's lunacy. He had had the courage for a moment to look into her eyes, and fancied to have seen the light of intelligence in every glance they emitted. He felt no compunction-no pity-no regret; and yet he had a heaviness settle down upon his mind, that depressed his spirit and made him wish that he had not seen her, or, since he did see her, that she had met him with a reception one might expect to obtain from a lunatic. 
                  John Harder, who was not slow to discover the change this visit to the crazy woman's room had wrought upon Mr. Arnold, began to inform him of the many and various ways in which Rachel's madness generally gave vent, dwelling at some length on his own and his wife's great patience with her when she was subjected to such fits, but all these remarks, and hints at better pay, fell on deaf ears-deaf because the mind was occupied with thoughts that had involuntarily intruded in the mental sanctum-and Mr. Arnold laid several bank-notes of various denominations, upon which Harder's eyes-but not as much as his wife's-rested greedily, upon the table, then retired through the door, so absently that he did not observe the sill, and almost fell over it. 
                  "I may be here again to-morrow," he said, a visit Mr. and Mrs. Harder would most cheerfully have dispensed with, but they thought it their interest to reply: 
                  "We shall be glad to see you at any day and any hour, and only hope that you will not be exposed again to such an unpleasant scene, Mr. Arnold. In the mean time, we shall do all in our power to make "the girl" as come fortable as it is in her condition to be made. 
                  This was Mrs. Harder; she had taken it upon herself to answer for both, and Mr. Harder felt considerably relieved when his visitor acknowledged in brief but appropriate language his obligations for the interest manifested in the sick girl-still called girl by him, though she was six and thirty years of age; more than that, was wife and mother-then shook hands again and took his final leave. 
                  He passed now through several streets, attended to some more business, visited a lawyer, where be stayed considerable time, then returned to his hotel. He met his servant as he went into the clerk's office, and whispered something in his ear too low for any one else, however close he might have been to them, to hear it. The servant gazed upon his employer with something like a dubious look, then shook his head assentingly and moved away. Now Mr. Arnold went straight through the hall right into the dining-room. He neither changed his attire nor made his toilet, a neglect of which he had not been guilty for nearly half a century. A plate of soup and a small slice of beef was all he took. He was a hearty eater, but to-day he had no appetite, and he rose from his chair before the remainder of the guests had half dined, and passed from the hall. At the door he met once more his servant, who handed him a slip of paper, upon which a name and the number of a street were written in a bold hand. Mr. Arnold looked down upon it for a moment, and then stuck it in his pocket. 
                  "Was he at home?" he inquired of his servant. 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "What did he say?" 
                  "He said that he would be glad to see you." 
                  Thus the colloquy ended. The servant stepped into the hotel, and his employer, after looking at the paper once more, went down the street. On the corner he hailed a carriage, gave the direction, and in less than twenty minutes he was deposited on the pavement in front of one of the most fashionable private residences that graced that elegant square. He paid the driver, the carriage rolled away, and he ascended the marble stiles and rang the bell. 
                  It was gloaming when he left the house, and as there was no carriage in a hailing distance he buttoned up his coat and made up his mind to foot his journey back to the hotel. He had scarcely proceeded a hundred paces before the door through which he had just been ushered once more opened, and this time a lady, tall and slender, stepped out upon the street. A dark brown vail hid her face successfully, but her light and graceful step, her splendid figure indicated every thing but old age. Mr. Arnold did not observe that he was followed, for the lady chose to keep a respectful distance until he had gone a considerable stretch, then she also hastened her steps. By this time it had grown very dark, and a drizzly rain had begun to fall from a leaden sky. Mr. Arnold placed his hands in his pocket-for the wind was sharp and biting-and hid his ears and few white locks under his raised collar. While thus walking along slowly-his limbs were too old to possess any unusual elasticity-a hand trembling and cold, was lightly laid on his arm, and a moment later, just as lightly removed. He shrank within himself, then stopped and looked around. By his side stood the lady, with that thick brown vail still hiding that face,-stood there stiff and motionless like a statue. 
                  "Who are you? What do you want?" he said, evidently frightened by this strange person who had so noiselessly stolen to his side. 
                  "I want to see you," she whispered hurriedly. "I want to talk to you. I have watched you, and here I am. You must satisfy me. You can not escape me. I have followed you here, and I would follow you to the end of the world, sooner than lose this opportunity. Say, isn't your name Arnold? Arnold? Arnold? Why don't you answer?" 
                  Once more her hand was laid upon his shoulder, and a strange fear sent an icy chill through his frame as she came one step nearer, and whispered into his ear, "Let us go together." 
                  Mr. Arnold had been taken so much by surprise that he scarcely knew what to answer. Thus to be stopped, in such a strange manner, and by such a strange person, on one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, at so late an hour, was an occurrence of that class he had so often met with in books of fiction, the incidents of which he had always considered preposterous exaggerations of the truth which could originate simply in the brains of some sensational writers; but that such things could happen outside of the novelist's world, could happen in reality, and that to him, was a conclusion to which this evening's experience made him reluctantly arrive. He couldn't guess who that strange woman might be, and what she could possibly want of him. He had certainly wronged no one in this city, was a white-headed old man, with no particular female acquaintances, and those few he did know were not of the class to seek an interview with him in so strange a manner. Was it a wonder then that he was dumbfounded for the moment? He knew well enough-he had lived too long not to know it-that hundreds of women were nightly out on the streets of San Francisco to lure men-especially strangers, which are so readily recognized by them as fat game-to their dens of vice, shame and licentiousness. He knew equally as well that upon old men especially-men of his age who still love, despite that age, to have a handsome, coquettish face turned upon them now and then-their wiles and attractions were offered in profusion, knowing that to persons whom the angels of love relinquish the syren voice of temptation is peculiarly sweet and enchanting. But was it likely that a woman having that object in view would have met and accosted him in this manner? Mr. Arnold thought, and rightly was he of that opinion, that she would not. He was certainly no stranger to her. He was certainly the man she had been looking for, and whom she would follow to the end of the world sooner than to lose this opportunity of speaking to him. She had said so, and he believed it. There was something so very earnest, something that gave it a particular force, in her voice. Could it be-? No! it was preposterous to think so. How should she have come here? And then this woman's voice, figure, gait, her dress and every thing, was so different to-; no, it wasn't she. This much was settled in his mind. But having arrived at that conclusion, felt he easier on that account? Far from it. And when that trembling hand once more touched his shoulder, and she had advanced a step nearer to him and whispered into his ear, "Let us go together," he fairly shook with fright. He would have given much if some one had just come along in this dark street. But as fate would have it, he couldn't espy a solitary being far and wide. The strange woman, who was looking at him through her thick vail, must have guessed the thoughts that were just passing through his mind, for she removed her hand from his shoulder, and said, as she approached still nearer to him, "Why do you fear me? Are you not an old man, and do you think I would hurt an old man? Come, let us go together." 
                  Mr. Arnold was now sure that the woman before him was neither a wanton nor a criminal, but one who was demented. Would any sane person speak as she did? He believed she would not. He was certain she would not. The woman must be demented. Arrived at this conclusion, he felt considerably relieved. The woman couldn't want anything of him; now all he had to do was simply to refrain from agitating her, until some one would arrive, with whose assistance he might rid himself of this annoyance. He was already congratulating himself for being out of personal danger, when his nerves got another and a far more terrible shock than before, to make his very blood run cold through his veins. The woman had taken hold of his hand, and whispered in a low, hurried manner: "You are afraid of me, and yet I have done you nothing that should make you afraid. Tell me, what did you do in that house? What did you say to him? Who is that crazy woman? Tell me, who is she?" 
                  He stood there as if petrified. These questions coming one upon another, in regular succession, dispelled the delusion from his mind that the strange person before him was demented. No, there was something in her tone, in her manner, in her calmness, that told him the woman before him was as sane as he, had a settled purpose for stopping him, and was not speaking at random. Who she was, from whence she came, he was at a loss to conjecture. That it was some person who knew more or less of his life he could no longer doubt. How much and what she knew of it, that was the question. He would make an end to all surmises, and speak to her. He had regained part of his composure, and the surprise being abated, his own vanity and self-importance came to his rescue, and he said: 
                  "I do not know, nor do I care to know, who you are, madame. Had I not thought that you were demented-a delusion under which I have strangely labored until now-I should not have lingered here at your bidding, and listened to your questioning me upon matters which can not concern you in the least. Where I have been, what I have said, and who that crazy woman is-though I scarcely know to what crazy woman you refer-not acknowledging your right to my confidence, or even to my acquaintance-I am disinclined to tell you. You will therefore suffer me undisturbedly to proceed on my way." 
                  As he said this the woman's grip tightened on his hand; but as he was determined to make an end to this interview at once, he jerked his arm loose and moved away without saying another word. But the woman didn't let him proceed far. She was following him close to his heels; he could hear it-he could feel it. Why did his courage fail him? Why did he tremble like an aspen leaf? 
                  That hand was once more laid upon his shoulder, and that calm, low voice once more whispered at his side: "I have followed you here, and I would follow you to the end of the world, sooner than to lose this opportunity of speaking to you." 
                  He halted. Right by his side stood that strange being, her features still concealed under that think woolen vail. He did not attempt to remove her hand from his shoulder, but said, while he mustered strength enough to face her: 
                  "In God's name, why do you follow me, woman?" 
                  "Because you have not answered me the questions I have put to you." 
                  "You had no right to ask them." 
                  "Perhaps not, and yet I want them answered. Tell me, what did you say to him? Who is that crazy being?" 
                  "Woman, I shall certainly have you arrested for dogging my very steps," Mr. Arnold said, assuming a boldness he was far from feeling. 
                  "This would not relieve you from answering my questions," she replied, quite composedly, and by no means intimidated by this threat. "Perhaps you would prefer answering them in the presence of a third party. Very well, I am satisfied. We shall wait here until some one arrives." 
                  Now the table was turned. Up to the present moment his only wish, his only hope of getting rid of that woman, was the arrival of another person. Now he dreaded that event almost as much as the presence of the woman itself. He would not wait, if he could possibly help it, so he said, as if he were affronted: 
                  "What right have you to pry in my affairs?" 
                  She moved her hand away from his shoulder, and placed it under his arm. "Come," she said, "let us walk along, and I will tell you." 
                  He didn't resist any longer. He went along with her. Resting on his arm, this mysterious woman looked like a dark shadow by his side. With an unpleasant anxiety he waited for her to begin to speak. The first words she uttered were not likely to remove that anxiety; in fact, they increased it. "You asked me," she commenced, after they had silently proceeded several paces ahead, "what right I have to pry into your affairs. Might I not answer: almost the same right you claim for yourself in controlling her destiny." 
                  Controlling her destiny! Whose destiny? Could he be so dull, or free of scruple, as to be at a loss to know whom she meant? Mr. Arnold's strange companion must have been of a different opinion, for she added, after a short pause: "What is that woman-that crazy woman-to you? Your name is Arnold. Is her name also Arnold?" 
                  She stopped speaking; she stopped walking. Her hand was once more drawn from under his arm, and stiffly-icily-laid upon his shoulder. Her face confronted his; it was still covered, but he imagined to see a pair of large black eyes glistening under that vail. "You have not answered me yet," she continued, and her other hand was laid upon his arm. "No, you have not answered me yet. What is she to you? Is her name Arnold also?" 
                  No! his mind was made up. He would not be questioned by a stranger. He would 
                     not gratify that woman's curiosity. She was some sort of an impostor, who by some means or other had become acquainted with some of his private affairs, the knowledge of which-who knew?-she wanted to use for her own personal advantage. If that was the case he would soon get rid of her. If money was all she wanted, why, bad luck to her, she should have it. He was just about to make her a proposition to that effect, when she asked for the third time, "What is she to you? Is her name Arnold also?" 
                  He passed over these questions as if he had not heard them at all, and said, with an air of independence he by no means felt at the moment, "Woman, how much money do you want? Say any reasonable sum and you shall have it." 
                  A dead, dead pause after this. The woman's hand tightened around his arm, and he fancied to feel her shake from agitation. Some neighboring clock struck the hour of the night, and its dull sound vibrated ominously through the air. It was only after its echo had died away, that she advanced again, and said: "Did you hear? It just struck eight. I must be off. Are you going to answer me?" 
                  "How much money do you want?" 
                  "I want none of your money. I want your answer, and this at once, else I'll cry for help. Yes, I'll cry for help. Do you hear this? You must tell me who that woman is?" 
                  He felt as if a piece of cold steel had entered his heart. He had again been mistaken. The woman did not want his money. She wanted information, and he came now to the conclusion to make a virtue of necessity and satisfy her to-him-unaccountable able curiosity. 
                  "You want to know who that woman is," he said, "and I will tell you. That woman is my daughter." 
                  "Your daughter?" she replied after him, once more laying hold on his arm. "Your daughter? And what is she to him? Tell me, tell me, for God's sake, what is she to him?" 
                  A gentleman was coming toward them. Should he or should he not stop him? thought Mr. Arnold; but before he had time to do either the mysterious woman had turned from his side, and was now hurrying back in the same direction from which they had come. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER III. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              THE man who dares to dress misdeeds, 
                              And color them with virtue's name, deserves 
                              A double punishment from God and men. 
                           
                         
                        CH. JOHNSON'S MEDEA. 
                      
                   
                  THE lady who had so hastily retreated from Mr. Arnold's presence, on the approach of the gentleman she had espied and recognized through her vail, did not slacken her pace nor stop even as much as to take breath until she arrived in front of the house from which we have seen her emerge something like an hour before. Now, for the first time, she turned her head and looked back along the street she had come, and, finding not a living being standing or walking on either side of it, a heavy breath, as in relief, rose from her heart, as she whispered to herself, "Thank God! he has not seen me." Taking a small key from her pocket, she hastily turned the lock and disappeared behind the door. Noiselessly, so much so that she could scarcely hear her own tread upon the carpeted floor, she passed along the hall, then up two flights of stairs then along another long hall, at the extremity of which she stopped, turned another lock, and a moment later lighted the gas in her own room. 
                  It is needless to describe that room; it differed little with other rooms in which opulence abounds. It had its fine mahogany furniture, its rich lace curtains on the windows, and velvet carpet on the floor. If any thing could have attracted your attention at all, it would have been an unusually large book-case, that stood in one corner of the room, and was filled from top to bottom with all kinds and shapes of books. They were carelessly piled up one upon another, as if they had been frequently used, and not placed there on the shelves for ornament. In so far it differed with the most rooms of other ladies. This had a book-case filled with books that were used; others had toilet-tables and ward-robes, and closets freighted down with every imaginary thing that could possibly enhance the external beauty of their occupants. 
                  We will now proceed to describe the lady herself. She had lighted the gas, and the vail that had shrouded her features was removed. The first, the second, and the third glance would have declared that face to be downright ugly. It was of a dark, very dark, color, even now unrelieved by the least tinge of red the cold, sharp wind would have called up on any other face. Its features, though regular, were not of a nature to add to her femininity. They were strongly marked, and gave more force than beauty to her face. Her lips were red and full; her nose was rather long, but not too long to harmonize with the other members that surrounded it. Her eyes were black and large, and her hair-those long, long tresses she had pinned up in a heavy crown at the back of her head-was of that glossy black we search for in vain outside of the Bohemian gipsy's camp. The whole face looked like that of a man, and left the impression upon you that never a smile had thrown its light over it. Her neck was round, and lost itself in a bust full and large, whose waist was too plump, as, in fact, the whole figure, down to her feet. She was no beauty, and had no pretentions to be one. And yet there was some one who had looked into her face and pronounced it beautiful; had studied her form and called it faultless; had watched her gait, beheld her movements, and went in ecstacy over them. He had seen those large black eyes light up; had seen those pearly teeth peep from under those tulip lips; had seen smiles dance upon her cheeks; had seen with what grace and dignity her firm limbs carried that noble body; had seen how lovely, how beautiful, she could grow under the least excitement, and he had become wild in his admiration for that Juno-like figure, in whose bosom he fancied to detect a slumbering world of love for any man who could awake it. 
                  As she stood now near the table, the light falling in full force upon her figure, you were unconsciously reminded of the amorous Egyptian Queen whose charms were the downfall of Marc Antony. What! not beautiful? Look at her well! Notice the passions as they now play upon her face and light up her eyes, and you will declare that head fit to sit so royally, upon a figure, that, in this resting pose, exhibited all the grace the vividest imagination could picture to itself. Look at her well! Don't you observe in those eyes, in those voluptuous lips, in that rounded shoulder, in that heaving bosom, something beautifully feminine? Don't you see how love could transform that whole being, and almost consume you in its passion? Can't you picture to yourself how those eyes would look, how that bosom would heave, how those lips would tremble, and how that heart would beat, under the influence of love? There would be no dilly dallying-no half-way doings. Her affection would break beyond all limits, spring forth like a mighty flame, and glorifiy with an ecstacy run riot, every pulsation of her nerves. Not beautiful? Look at that small, dimpled hand, that beautiful rounded arm, that graceful neck, and it will lead you involuntarily into speculations that would make you a permanent slave to her fascinations. 
                  The man in whose heart she had awakened a feeling of love, was something like nine and thirty years of age, and almost twenty-one years her senior. He was of that class of beings that under no circumstances, under no passions, ordinary or extraordinary, can find the least redemption for their ugly looks. He was small, almost diminutive in size, very lank and bony, with long arms and stooping shoulders, a thin, long neck upon which stuck a thin, long face, that had a sallow color, and always wore one expression, never allowing his passions, if he had any, to disturb the immobility of its features. His nose was also long, his cheek-bones were long, his ears were long, everything was long in that thin whitish, long face, except his greenish-yellow eyes, which were round and small, and restlessly moved in their narrow orbits over which a broad high forehead frowned like a precipice overhanging a treacherous sea. His hair was yellow-a yellow that didn't remind one of auburn or gold, but of that dull sand upon which the sun had never thrown a single ray. It was always cut short, summer or winter, showing off to a ludicrous disadvantage a head not otherwise eminently attractive. His thin, bloodless lips covered an almost toothless mouth He wore on all occasions his best, and that consisted of an old suit of black cloth, which had never been cut for his body, and hung upon it as loose as an old bag. He had a shuffling gait, and a peculiar drawl by which he could be recognized as far as his diminuitive form could be seen, and it was by this gait and drawl that he had been known  evening by this lady who had fled his present as soon as she had seen him come in the direction where she had stood with Mr. Arnold. She would sooner have met the arch-fiend himself than that man in whose bosom she had unconsciously kindled a passion, of which he thought while he was awake, of which he dreamed while he was asleep. But she had luckily escaped him, and at this moment he was as much forgotten by her as if such a person had never existed at all. She was thinking of other things-things that disturbed her mind and heart-mysteries she was determined to solve before she went to bed. 
                  She rang a tiny bell, then she sat down by the window, and looked out into the dark. Five, ten, fifteen minutes passed, and no one answered her call. She got up and rang again, then walked toward the stove and waited there for the result. The second summons, like the first, remained unanswered. One could see she was not pleased with it. Those black eyes began to glisten, and her lips showed signs of anger in their compressed curves. She left the stove and moved toward the door. She heard a step outside in the hall, and she waited until it died away in the distance, then passed from her room. She was gone something like half an hour; when she returned she was not alone. A gentleman was with her-a gentleman who appeared to be fifty, and might be less-who wore the marks of thought and intelligence on his still handsome face. He stepped in the room first, then she followed, keeping in the room first, then she followed, keeping her eyes upon him, until he had reached the center, near the table, then she turned back and locked the door from the inside. 
                  "What do you want?" said the gentleman, not understanding the meaning of such a proceeding. 
                  "I want you," she replied, and left the door. 
                  "And what do you want of me, daughter?" 
                  They were facing one another now, as they stood side by side, and a dead silence of several moments ensued. The lady was evidently embarrassed, for twice her lips seemed in the act of giving utterance to something that lay uppermost in her mind, but her hesitancy indicated either an undeveloped plan of action or a confusion of thoughts which the observance of a short pause might allay. The gentleman could see very well that this interview with his daughter was not likely to be of an ordinary character. He could observe that much in her face; he could read that much in her eyes. Though at no time given to laughter, and of an exhibition of youthful and pardonable liveliness, he had not often seen her so calm, thoughtful, and depressed, as she appeared to him now, standing by his side. 
                  "Father," she commenced at last, her words falling like so many pieces of lead on his ears, "I called you to my room in order to hear the truth, and nothing but the truth, from your lips." 
                  The gentleman she had called father, and who is known to our readers by the name of Archibald Thornton, felt something like a cold sensation creep through his frame as he listened to his daughter Ruth, whom we beg leave to introduce once more in the progress of this narrative. He had been a kind father to her, and his wife, her stepmother, as far as he knew, and could judge by daily observations, was equally as kind to her. It is true now and then he had noticed a little coldness of an hour or perhaps a day's duration between them, but he never concerned himself on account of such a trifle. "Women will have their spats," he would think for a moment, "and the best thing under the circumstances is non-interference." And this principle he scarcely ever violated. He had never felt curious to know whether Lucretia, his wife, or Ruth, his daughter, was in the wrong. He knew them to be women, and, as it is generally with the disagreements of women, when the matter is closely sifted, the right is with neither. Certainly his wife was only Ruth's stepmother, but why should he have been biased against her on that account? Wasn't Ruth only Lucretia's step-daughter? And wasn't it as likely for one as for the other to remember it at an unfavorable moment? Mr. Archibald had thought it was most likely, and therefore never interfered, and was determined in not interfering now should his daughter have called him up to her room for that purpose. But while he was mentally taking this resolution, her locking of the door, her facial expression, her manner of speaking, her last words 'that she wants to hear the truth, and nothing but the truth, from his own lips, raised a very reasonable suspicion in his mind that he had not been called to decide and settle some slight disagreement between mother and daughter. Consequently he said, while a faint smile passed over his handsome old face: "Have I ever told you any thing else but the truth, daughter? Why doubt me now? What interest can I have in withholding the truth of any thing from you? Come, and speak to the purpose, Ruth; what is it you want to hear or know?" 
                  Mighty must have been the suspicions she was harboring in her mind, else these words, so gently and affectionately uttered by a father who had, ever since she had returned to his home some eight years before, been so very good to her, would have dispelled them at once. 
                  "I want to hear and know," she said, "what that man who came to see you this afternoon is to you and me." 
                  He blanched, and, with all the control he had over his feelings, he possessed not the skill to master them this time. This request of his daughter had disconcerted him, and the change, though it was but ephemeral, of his facial expression, told her that her suspicions were not unfounded-in fact, that she had struck home. She had a quick wit, and thought the best thing she could do, since she believed herself on the right track, was to follow up her success before her father had time to rally himself. Hence, with her eyes still resting on his face, and her voice somewhat clearer and sharper, she slowly added: "Is he my grandfather?" 
                  Archibald Thornton would have staggered and fallen had he not supported himself on the table near which his daughter was still facing him. For a moment his lips trembled, but only for a moment, then he called up a smile to his face, and replied: "Who, daughter? Who?" He raised his hand and gently stroked her calm, stern brow and cheeks in a quieting, coaxing manner. 
                  It had not the effect it was intended to have. Up to this moment, though now and then doubts had entered her mind, she had thought her father all honor, and, having believed him incapable of any thing unworthy, esteemed as well as loved him. But at this touch, so uncalled for, and that of a man not given to such outward manifestations of affection, her old suspicions were aroused with increased force, and something like a feeling of disgust swayed her bosom, and a sense of insult to her understanding embittered her mind, as she felt that hand gently touching her skin. She did not recoil from that touch, though with a quickened sensibility he felt the cheek under his palm grow cold, stiff and hard, as she answered: "You know whom I mean. I mean Mr. Arnold." 
                  His hand fell listlessly to his side, and once more his lips began to quiver. "Let us sit down," he said, and he turned away to get two chairs. When he returned with them from the opposite corner, he seemed to have acquired his self-composure, for he added, playfully, as he pointed to one of the seats, "Sit down, Ruth, and tell me who put that nonsense in your head." 
                  "Father, it is no nonsense," she replied. "The old gentleman with whom you were locked up this afternoon is no other than my grandfather. Do not deny it-do not deny it, for I know it-my heart tells me so: he is-he is my grandfather." 
                  Up to this moment Archibald Thornton had felt distressingly uneasy; but no sooner had her feelings been expressed in words, and he discovered that "only her heart" had told her so and so, "Only her heart!" as he inwardly laughed, he felt angry at himself for having suffered fear to suppress his better judgment. 
                  "But it is nonsense, daughter," he said. "I am really at a loss to understand why you should look upon this gentleman, or upon any other whose business should compel him to visit me in my house, as your grandfather. Your mother's parents, like herself, have long, long years ago paid their last debt to nature. This gentleman to whom you refer resides in the country, and is quite a stranger in this city. He came to consult me in regard to some administration to which he has been appointed. He is no relative of yours, and even knows not that such a person as my worthy daughter exists. And is this all you have called me up for?" he added, and smiled. 
                  "Father! father! do not deceive me. This man is in some way or other connected with my destiny. His name is Arnold, and there was a time when I was called Arnold. He came to see you in regard to some crazy woman. Father! father! do not deny it. That crazy woman is-O, God! I tremble even to think of it-say, say, is it not my mother?" 
                  Despite the control Mr. Archibald Thornton had over his feelings, this question, so agonizingly put, startled him. 
                  "Ruth," he said, "I must confess you have surprised me. Such a preposterous idea can scarcely originate in a sane mind. That crazy woman your mother! But, before we proceed farther, Ruth, how did you come to question me? What do you know about this old gentleman, or about the woman you are pleased to call crazy? Remember, daughter, the consultation that was had in this house this afternoon, was private, and witnessed by none. How did you discover the gentleman's name, and that the subject of our conversation was of a crazy woman?" 
                  "Father," she replied, looking him straight in the eye, "I have never deceived you, and I shall not deceive you now. I have been listening, yes, listening at the door when you were closeted together this afternoon. The name of Arnold had struck my ears, and I could not withstand the temptation, and I had to listen." 
                  "And what did you hear when you did listen?" Thornton inquired, feeling in his pocket, and afterward bringing out a small knife, the blade of which he playfully began to handle. 
                  "I heard nothing distinctly, father," Ruth said, "except now and then a word, a sentence, which led me to believe, when put together, that the unfortunate woman who was the subject of your conversation, and whom you called by the name of Rachel, was my mother." 
                  "How much have you overheard of our conversation?" 
                  "Much, father, and yet I would give-why, my life!-to have heard more of it." 
                  Mr. Archibald Thornton rose from his seat, closed up the small knife, and returned it to his pocket. "Ruth," he said, calmly "you have this day insulted me more than I am likely to forget in the few years I have to live yet. To be suspected by my own daughter of a wrong, a crime, the nature of which is so revolting to my understanding, marks an era in my life nothing-even not all your kindness toward me in the future-will be able to obliterate.' 
                  He said nothing else. Ruth's eyes followed him as he withdrew. Long, very long in the night, she still sat upon that chair, vaguely staring at the empty space, and thinking over what had transpired to her on this day that was now drawing to a close. Could she have been mistaken, and had she really done her father wrong? Was it possible that she had not heard aright, and that the unfortunate woman of whom she had heard them speak so long and so earnestly, was nothing to her? She tried hard to convince herself that she was wrong, that she had done her father injustice, and that her ears had deceived her, but somehow her suspicions, after being driven away and allayed for a moment, would return to her in double force, and oppress her heart with an unaccountable heaviness. Something was wrong, she knew it, she felt it. Her father had not convinced her, as she would like to have been convinced, of the fallacy of her supposition. How had he met her charge? How had he answered her question? Had he told her who that man was? Had he told her who that woman was? 
                  No! 
                  She felt angry at herself. She had determined on putting her father to the severest test, and what had she done? Asked a question or two, and then suffered him to depart under a pretense of wounded pride and dignity. She had always been sufficiently self-possessed-why had she not been so at this time when it was required most? 
                  She retired, dissatisfied with herself, just as it struck twelve. Strange, confused, and unpleasant, were her dreams that night. Never before had she been so restless, and only after the cock had heralded the morn did she fall into a quiet and peaceful sleep. It had a salutary effect both on her looks and constitution, for when she rose some few hours later she felt quite refreshed and strong. She made a hasty toilet, then went down stairs to the dining-hall. Breakfast had been taken by the rest of the household, she was informed by the servant, something like a couple of hours before. "Is father at home?" she asked, as she sat by her coffee, "or has he gone out already?" 
                  "He left right after his meal," said the girl, helping her young mistress to a piece of toast. "He told your mother that he would not be home till night." 
                  "Did he tell mother why he would stay out so long, and where he was going?" Ruth asked. 
                  "He did not tell her any thing else in my presence," answered the girl, "but in the hall he met your uncle Meely, to whom I heard him remark that he need not say any thing to you about it." 
                  Ruth dropped her spoon, as if it had grown hot in her hand, looked reflectingly for a moment at the opposite wall, then turned around and gazed straight in the girl's face. 
                  "About what does he not need to say any thing to me?" 
                  "I don't know about what, Miss Ruth," was the reply. "I did not hear of what they had been speaking; when I passed through the hall, your father was just going to the door with your uncle Meely following him. And these were his words: 'Meely, you needn't say any thing to Ruth about it." 
                  "And then father went out?" 
                  "Yes, he went out after that, just as a white-headed old gentleman rang the bell-" 
                  "The bell and-" 
                  "Your father took him by the arm, and hurried away with him at once." 
                  "Did Meely see them go away?" 
                  "Yes, ma'am, and, if I mistake not, he went away right after they did." 
                  "Do you think he followed them?" 
                  "I don't know, Miss Ruth." 
                  How should the girl know? What a foolish question of her to ask! She hadn't watched. She hadn't suspected anything extraordinary or wrong in the going out either of the one or the other. 
                  Ruth started from her chair and left the dining-room, just as the hall-door opened to admit the gentleman whom she had seen on the previous evening and who was small, lank and bony, with yellow eyes and yellow hair, and who had taken it in his head to fall in love with his sister Lucretia's stepdaughter. It was Meely Broadwell, brother of Clarence and Lucretia, and one of the attaches of Thornton's household. He had made his love known to Ruth on many occasions, and notwithstanding the unmistakable signs by which she had indignantly rejected his advances at all times, he had still been bold enough to persist in his persecutions with a mad hope of conquering at last. He was generally employed in the office of his brother-in-law, Mr. Thornton, as a copyist of briefs, deeds, agreements etc., etc. Ruth could not imagine what could be the reason of his leaving the office at this hour of the day, and that, too, during the absence of her father, and come home. She appeared not to notice his approach and hurried on in the opposite direction, in the hope of reaching the back step that led to the second and third floors, before he could stop and address her. In this she was successful. But when she arrived at the head of the stairs she had the mortification of finding herself side by side with Meely. 
                  "You have red cheeks this morning, Ruth," he said, turning his yellow eyes admiringly upon Ruth's countenance. "Cold weather always brings the healthy tinge to the face of the young. It is splendid out doors, and as I sat in my office and looked at the clear blue sky, I thought of going home and beg you to take a walk with me for an hour or so. Will you go with me?" 
                  "No!" 
                  With any one else but Meely Broadwell this decisive "no" would have settled this part of the conversation for once and all; but this answer by no means discouraged him from further efforts, as he had not expected any thing else to his question. Like the great Scotch chieftain, he would try again; perhaps his second effort would be more successful. 
                  "Upon my word, Ruth," he said, following her along the passage, "I did not expect to meet with such a rebuff. Tell me what I have done amiss to you, that you should begrudge me a civil answer? I politely invited you to walk, thinking that you would to some extent appreciate my readiness to serve you, and what was the result? You insulted me in return; yes, Ruth, you did. You might have declined my invitation with less cruelty to me, I think, and the result, as far as it concerns you, would have been quite the same, while you could have spared me this unnecessary pain. Don't think, Ruth, that in order to possess delicacy and sensitiveness it requires those external beauties of form and feature which nature thought proper to deny me. I am ugly, deformed, and possess no charms by which to attract and fascinate a woman; but the want of these very charms, Ruth, makes me that much more sensitive of an injury wantonly inflicted on me. What wrong have I asked of you? I have begged you to suffer me to take you out walking, and the first thing it pleased you to do was to insult me in return." 
                  "I did not wish to insult you, Meely," she replied, stopping in the middle of the hall, looking down upon the long-faced, yellow-eyed dwarf by her side, whose thin, long fingers were nervously playing with the lapel of his loose black coat; "and you know I did not. You have so often forced me to be harsh to you, when I should have thanked you from my very heart had you spared me that necessity. I have repeatedly and distinctly tinctly told you that you could show me no greater favor than by sparing me from your gallantry and attention. Why do you persist in a course of action that makes you loathsome in my sight? I would respect you, if you were only to suffer me to do so; but you won't. You follow me like an ugly ghost-like an evil genius. I have no love for you-never will have. I think it is about time that this much should be clear to you. Now, if you have a desire to drive me from my father's house, you have only to continue your persecution, and it can be accomplished." 
                  "I do not wish to drive you from your father's house," he said, apologetically, as he watched that noble figure-in its fullest ripeness-look with a withering look down upon him. "What offense have I committed in loving you? And is it a fault of mine, that that passion is so deeply rooted in my heart that I cannot destroy it? And will you hate me now because I was bold enough to confess it to you? Ruth, Ruth, I know were I handsome as I am ugly, my allegiance, my devotion, my love for you would flatter your vanity as they now insult your dignity. But I have not come to reproach you, Ruth, nor to urge my claims to your affection. I have come to ask you for a walk to show the world that you are not ashamed to be seen with me on the streets. What can you know of my sufferings? Who should have told you how I have become the laughing stock of all my friends, who sneer and jibe at me? "Your own niece would consider it a disgrace to be seen on the street with you," they say in derision of me, and the poor heart in this ungainly form weeps bitter, bitter tears that they should've told the truth. You are ashamed to acknowledge me as your uncle," he continued with a little excitement, that lighted up his yellow eyes and yellow face, "and it is that what grieves me most. It is you who have embittered my life and have driven me to the verge of despair. It is you who are the cause of all my unhappiness. It is very easy for you to deny from the world that you once did look with a favorable eye upon my aspirations to your hand and heart, but your own conscience must rise in judgment against you, when you now, after I have become your slave, trifle with the affection you have once so assiduously sought and encouraged." 
                  For a moment Ruth could scarcely believe her senses. These words, as they fell from the oily tongue of that dwarf-like figure, were so unexpected, and the charge they contained so unfounded, that she thought of treating it as a joke-as an ill-timed joke, as a matter of course-until she saw him approach, and, coaxingly-despicably coaxing-raise his sanctimonious face to hers, and think of attempting-for it was scarcely an attempt yet before Ruth, as if by intuition, repelled the insult with indignation-to twine his long, thin arm around her waist. In an instant the blood boiled in her veins and rushed to her cheeks. The truth flashed upon her at once. That wretch was not joking; he was terribly, determinately, and disgustingly, in earnest. She shrank away from him before he had time to pollute her with his touch, and was in the act of dealing him a slap in the face, when, as she looked down upon that puny creature, his yellow eyes, like those of an abject slave, still raised to hers, a laugh of derision escaped her lips, and her uplifted arm fell to her side without inflicting upon herself the shame and insult of having stooped to offering him a corporeat punishment. "Wretch!" she said-he turned instantly green, and his eyes seemed to retreat in their sockets-"you can not raise yourself to the hight of my contempt," and proceeded on her way along the hall. She had not gone five steps before she heard his voice call after her. It said "Ruth" sweetly, dispassionately, and clearly-said it in a tone and manner that sent a thrill through her frame. She knew that voice-knew the sweeter it sounded the greater its insincerity. Her first thought was of moving on as if she had not heard it at all, and-she moved on. She expected him to call her the second time, and she resolved to heed it no more than the first. But he didn't call, and her courage failed her. She had not heard him move away, and she still felt his wicked, yellowish eyes upon her, as if they would devour her, though she could not see them. Her heart palpitated loudly as she moved along now slower and slower. She was but five feet from an angle in the hall; could she but pass around it, and feel that those eyes were no longer upon her, she knew she would breathe easier. She made one-she made two steps hastily forward. Only three more. Why don't he call her again? How it would make her fly around that corner! Another step-won't he call?-she would stop a minute-only a minute, then go on. 
                  But she didn't go on; she turned around and her eyes traveled down the whole length of the hall. Right on the same spot, and in attitude in which she had left him, still stood Meely Broadwell. He did not seem to have moved an inch. The only change she could perceive was in his facial expression. That pleading look had disappeared entirely, and something like a smile-or something that was an ugly shadow of the reverse of a frown-appeared now and then, but only at intervals, to leave a light, like that seen in a cat's eye, upon his undisturbed face. He did not say a word as she looked down at him from the other extremity of the hall; nor did he seem surprised at her stopping. He simply began to move forward, not for a moment taking his eyes from her, until he came by two feet to where she stood, then stopped and said: 
                  "I was irritated, Ruth, to have spoken to you as I did. Don't think of it any more, and I will promise not only to master my feelings in the future, but become your faithful friend, and banish such silly notions as love, affection, etc., from my head. Why should I trouble and persecute you-the only being I ever felt an interest in in all my life-with an attachment against which your better nature must revolt? No, Ruth, as I saw you walk along this hall just now-like a queen, Ruth, yes, like a queen at whose feet a king might be proud to kneel-I perceived the enormity of my unwarranted assumption, and felt convicted as a felon before the tribunal of my own conscience. Ruth, pardon me. Do not bear a grudge against me-do not. I know I uttered a falsehood-a shameful falsehood-when I said that you had encouraged me in aspiring to such things to which such as I have not the shadow of a claim. But I am so miserably unhappy-look at me, and I know you will feel a kind of pity for this unloved, dwarfish figure-is it a wonder, then, that I am at times in outs with the whole world, and find myself in the, humor of doing and saying the most wicked things in spite of anybody I think that that spite would gall and wound? But when my anger has subsided, and I find reason return to me again-O, how I then regret the mischief I have wrought! And I regret now the bitter words I have said to you. Promise to forgive me, Ruth. Say, will you forgive Meely Broadwell-poor, unloved and ill-tempered Meely Broadwell?" 
                  Ruth looked down for a moment upon that wincing figure-that thin, dwarfish, unfavored being who humiliatingly had lowered his elongated head upon his breast-and all the wrath and anger his conduct had excited in her bosom turned at once into a feeling of pity for the wretch, and she said: 
                  "Meely, I have spoken harsher to you than I should have done had you not aggravated me just when I was in the worst humor to receive it and the least prepared for it. You know I have an ugly temper, and many times I forget myself in saying ugly words which I do not mean, and feel sorry for when they are said and past recalling. Here, Meely, is my hand; I hold it out to you as a token of reconciliation. Let us be friends together in the future, and from this moment cancel from our memories the transcripts of past wrongs." 
                  She held out her hand to Meely openly, freely and magnanimously, and with what feelings and sensations it was clasped and pressed between those long, bony fingers, future events, perhaps better than his words, will be able to explain. 
                  "Ruth," he said, warmly-unfortunately with a warmth, which more than aught else was displeasing to her, for it lacked that indefinable something which convinced you of its sincerity-"I take your hand as a token of reconciliation, and promise not only to cancel from my memory such words and acts of yours which, on account of the pain they had occasioned, might have outlived the moment, but to acknowledge that you have been more than justified in your past treatment toward me." 
                  "Don't put all the blame on yourself, Meely-" 
                  "But I do," he interrupted her. "Even this morning, Ruth-yes, this morning I irritated you, when I knew that your thoughts-O, Ruth, Ruth, what right have I to speak of what has been perplexing you for the last four-and-twenty hours?" 
                  A pang shot through her heart. All she had ever said or done to him, or he to her, was forgotten at this moment. Her old suspicions-no longer suspicions now, but facts known to others, facts she had only surmised intuitively-once more hovered like a dark, heavy and immovable shadow over her mind, and banished every thing else from the realm of thought. She moved a step forward, nervously laid her hands upon his slanting shoulders, then looked anxiously first toward one extremity then toward the other of the long, narrow passage. She espied no one, and her head, for the first time in her life, was laid upon Meely's cheek, as she whispered into his ear: "Do you know-say, what do you know?" 
                  "You are too excited to hear-my sister is looking at us. I'll meet you in your own room by-and-by." 
                  They separated-Ruth moved around the corner, while Meely turned his steps in the direction from which his sister-Lucretia Thornton-was approaching him.

                  ARCHIBALD THORNTON'S second wife was what the world would call a truly handsome woman. She was now between two and three and thirty, enjoying the best of health, and would have considered herself happy had she been able to present Mr. Thornton with an offspring. But she was barren, and fancied that her husband, her friends, and her acquaintances, looked down and pitied her on that account. The misfortune-to a woman of her nature, a great misfortune-of having never been blessed to become a mother, had given her many sad hours and made her shed tears, when alone, in abundance, but not near as many as the thought that every one who knew her, believed her unhappy and an object of pity. Starting out with this idea, and determined to deceive the world, she had resolved upon a mode of life-a life for the public eye only-that would successfully conceal the ever-present, the ever-living, the ever-gnawing pain of her heart. For years now she had been declared not only one of the handsomest, but one of the liveliest ladies-if not the liveliest-that frequented private soirees, concerts, balls, theaters, and so on. How she could laugh, sing, dance, and flirt! Why, she had more courtiers at her feet than the most successful belle of the season. And she had truly deserved them. Never had a gentleman had occasion to complain of her want of attention or appreciation. In what ever a woman could encourage a human butterfly, Mrs. Lucretia Thornton was the quickest to perceive and the most liberal to offer. What did she care for scandal or for the scandal-mongers? What if they did say her conduct was, to say the least, questionable? Was it not preferable to be thought to be too much woman than not enough woman? Was it not less shame to have too much than not enough affection? And her husband-Mr. Archibald Thornton! What had she to care for the opinion of others so long as he feels either too indifferent or too sensible to find faults and raise complaints? If she did flirt, was it behind his back and at places and times when he had neither chance nor opportunity to see it? Had she not always invited, even to her very house, in the very sight and to the presence of her husband, those brushed-up, dressed-up, frizzed-up, two-legged male toys, who felt proud-like a gang of geese, one after another-to follow in her train? And had she ever in her married life entertained a single thought that was in conflict with truth, honor, and her plighted vows? 
                  Had she asked herself that question twice four-and-twenty hours ago, we believe, in all sincerity, that she could have answered it satisfactorily to her own conscience, and boldly faced each and every accusation that might have been raised against her purity. It is true she had flirted-flirted boldly in defiance of every rule established for the conduct of married women-but this was the whole extent of her indiscretion-and as it had successfully, as she thought, deluded the world, and impressed it with the belief and opinion in regard to her barrenness she had labored to establish, she did not care the snap of her finger for what other consequences her conduct carried along. Certainly she had been heartless, at times, to her train of admirers. One after another she had allowed to bask in the sunshine of her eyes, to find encouragement in her glances, pleasure in her laughter, happiness in her tete-a-tete, and ecstacy in-no, here her cruelty commenced. It is as far as she had allowed them to go-who ever aspired for more had fallen from her grace and was doomed to be banished ignominiously from the magic circle of which she was the life and light. 
                  All this up to twice four-and-twenty hours ago. 
                  This was Thursday; on the preceding Tuesday evening she had attended, in company with her husband, a gathering of friends at the mansion of Mr. Wilhoyte-one of the merchant-princes of the metropolis-to welcome and celebrate his return from China, a country in which he had cultivated the acquaintance of a certain Clermont Harland, a gentleman whose mental attainments were of the highest order, and who had returned with him to California and accepted the hospitality of his house. Mrs. Thornton, in due time, had had this Mr. Harland introduced to her, and, before the evening had passed by and had seen the guests repair to their respective homes, she had discovered-a thing she could have discovered, had she cared to do so, years ago-that her heart, true and faithful as it was, had been far from being entirely taken up-so that there was no room left for another-by the love for Archibald Thornton. Before the evening had half drawn to a close she had shown the cold shoulder to the swarm of butterflies that had hovered around her every step, to court and encourage a conversation that had sprung up between herself and that handsome stranger who had taken a seat by her side. How differend she had found him from the rest of men she knew! How learned, experienced and traveled! What a store of knowledge and information! How eloquent and unpretentious when he spoke! How considerate and attentive when he listened! His tone and manner varying without the least affectation. His voice never falling to a whisper nor rising bombastically! Just enough enthusiasm to give animation to his words; just enough modulation to prevent monotony. An artist unconscious of his art! An enchanter unconscious of his charms! 
                  As regards his personal appearance she had found it no less attractive than his mental acquirements. A woman of three and thirty supposes herself to be just of the age to be able to define and admire a handsome man. And according to Lucretia Thornton's idea of a "man," that dark-eyed, dark-haired, dark-faced-for the sun of the southern clime had deeply bronzed it-man of thirty summers, was more than passing handsome. She had closely observed those classic-almost effeminately beautiful features; the calm brow, the arched eye-brows and long-fringed lashes, that small, straight acquiline nose, those thin, gently curving lips, and that strange and unmistakable expression of thought, refinement and self-control that was visible in every feature, and had felt an interest-undefinable as it was now-for that man as she had never felt for any one else before. "Mr. Harland," she said to him, as her husband advanced toward her to notify her of the lateness of the hour, "you must not forget to call at our house during your stay in the city My husband-" he had just stopped opposite to them-" and I shall be happy to number you among our friends. Shall we have the pleasure of seeing you at Thornton Mansion (Mr. Archibald's magnificent residence was known all over the city by that name) on Thursday evening? Mr. and Mrs. Wilhoyte have already accepted the invitation. Few other friends will join us. Mr. Harland, shall we have the pleasure of your presence on that evening?" 
                  "I shall do me the honor of calling." 
                  And this was Thursday morning. Lucretia Thornton had risen early and had joined her husband at breakfast that morning-a thing she had not done for years. Mr. Thornton, at any other time, would have noticed this, but to-day his mind was occupied with graver matters. She had laughed and chatted as she had never laughed before, and when he had told her that he would likely remain away not only during the whole of the day, but that his return would in all probability take place late, if at all that night, she could scarcely manage to conceal the joy this information gave her. Mr. Clermont Harland to come to her house when her husband would not be there to watch her every movement! Not that she had the least intention of forfeiting the most trivial rule of propriety-not that she harbored an evil thought-not that she- 
                  Well, she had received that information with joy, and she didn't care to analyze the cause of that feeling. 
                  "Meely," she said now to her brother as she came up to him, "I'm glad to find you at home. It saves me the trouble of sending for you. Come into my room, I want you to do something for me." 
                  I have no time to spend with you now," he replied, with a show of irritation, and walking away from her. "I can never be about the house a moment unless you are pressing me into one service or another." 
                  "Meely, I don't want you to talk to me in this manner, do you hear? Just tell me, do you want to come into my room or not?" 
                  He hesitated a moment before he complied. He turned around sulkily, then followed his sister slowly around the corner and entered with her a cozy little room. "Sit down, Meely," she said, "and hear what I want of you." He rubbed his long, bony hand, and raised his small yellow eyes to his sister's handsome face. "You know Archie-" (she always called her husband by that abbreviation) "won't be here to-night. Mr. and Mrs. Stephens, Mr. and Mrs. Rosegay, Mr. and Mrs. Wilhoyte, and several other guests are coming for supper. I want you to do your utmost to entertain them, Meely. Were Archie here he would do it himself, and most creditably, too, but as in all probability he will not be here, it devolves upon you, in his absence, to officiate and do the honors of the house. Do you hear me, Meely? I want you to pay a little more attention to your personal appearance than it has been your custom to do." 
                  Meely Thornton was truly astonished at this request. Never before had his sister hinted at his personal appearance. Never before had she cared whether he was attired in rags or the finest of cloth. What could she be up to? There was certainly some thing hidden behind this unaccountable manifestation of care in his behalf. He would find it out sooner or later. For the present his curiosity was not as great as his discretion, and he refrained from questioning her. He wanted to go away, and he knew of no way to get away sooner than by promising to comply with his sister's request, and though he intended to do as he had always done, and that was pretty much as he pleased, he stopped all further arguments and entreaties and said he would act as he had been bid. This done, he excused himself, and slowly drawled out of the room. Few minutes later he was closeted with Ruth, who had been anxiously waiting for him. What happened at that conference, strange and terrible events which we are bound-though our heart sickens at the thought-to relate, will show and fully explain elsewhere. For the present we would only remark that it was near noon when the dwarf, with a grim smile resting on his sickening face, was seen to leave Thornton Mansion only to return to it again an hour before dark. It was in the lower hall that he had to experience the mortification of meeting his sister for the second time that day, though he managed, as he always did, when he felt inclined to do so, to hide his anger from her. But his appearance on this occasion was enough to surprise her. His boots and pants were literally covered over with mud, his coat and vest were torn, and his hat was crushed and out of shape. "Where in the world have you been, Meely?" she exclaimed, falling back apace, and looking down upon him. "What have you been doing? You certainly have not been fighting? Good gracious! look at your coat! look at those pants! And is this the attire in which you intend to do the honors of the house this evening?" 
                  "I shall put on another suit for the occasion," he said, trying to appease and get rid of his sister, though he knew full well that he hadn't another pair of pants or coat to his name. 
                  "Well, it is about time that you were at it," she replied. "In less than two hours the guests will arrive, and, as I feared, Archie will not be here to receive them. By the by, what is up between you and Ruth? She has been down inquiring after you more than a dozen times." 
                  "What can she want of me, I wonder?" he said, and slunk away, as if he did not know with what eagerness his return had been looked for. He moved up one flight of stairs, then another, and shortly after-just in the condition in which he had come home-he knocked at a small door. Ruth handsome as ever, but paler than usual, stepped out on the sill and confronted him. 
                  "Have you seen him?" she inquired eagerly. 
                  "Yes." 
                  "Have you seen her?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because she lives simply in your imagination. I was at her grave, from which I have just returned fully satisfied of the injustice you have done in harboring such terrible suspicions against your father." 
                  She looked at him for a moment, then heaved a heavy sigh and turned back into her room, leaving Meely standing alone in the long dark passage. She did not see the bitter, malicious glance that shot from his eyes as she turned away from him, else she would have cursed herself for having revealed to him her secret thoughts. But she had not seen it, and now reproached herself for her suspicions she had harbored against her father. Her mother told her that guests were expected, and in consequence of which she had made a suitable toilet for the occasion. She did not expect that she would meet this night a man she had known in childhood-a man who had had her first and only love-a man who would recognize her, but whom, much as her contact had been with him in years gone by, and much as her contact with him would be in years to come, she would never identify as her foster-brother-EDGAR ARMHOLD!

                  THE sumptuous supper was over and the guests among whom were Mr. and Mrs. Wilhoyte, Mr. Clermont Harland-by which name Edgar Armhold shall be known to our readers in the future-had withdrawn themselves to the drawing-room below. Neither the host, Mr. Archibald Thornton, nor Mr. Meely Broadwell, brother of the hostess, had made their appearance to do the honors of the house. Mrs. Thornton had excused herself for the absence of her husband already at the dining table, and the visitors, with the exception of Clermont Harland, to whom the rendered excuse did not seem to be quite clear and satisfactory, entered fully in the spirit of enjoyment, without bestowing a further thought on the absent host. The assembly was far more numerous than Clermont Harland was led to believe it would be at the time his invitation had been tendered and accepted. Not only Mr. and Mrs. Stephens, Mr. and Mrs. Rosegay and Mr. and Mrs. Wilhoyte, but at least a dozen other couples-principally young persons of both sexes-were here in full dress, evincing by their display of finery an ostentatious love of show, extravagance and wealth, which did not escape the eyes of Mr. Harland, who was simply attired in a plain suit of black, unrelieved by anything save by a snowy white shirt-front, collar and wristbands. But notwithstanding this plainness of dress it was but a little while before he was pronounced by the ladies the handsomest man in the room. They crowded around him with eagerness, and overwhelmed him with questions, that only a man whose mind was well-balanced, whose vanity was not easily aroused, and who had the tact to understand when, how and what to speak, could meet, however trifling some of these questions were, with that appreciative display of interest and attention, that is alike flattering to the querist, and creditable to the queried. It was with no little pride, and with a strange feeling of something like guilt, that Lucretia Thornton withdrew him to the further end of the drawing-room, as the musicians struck up for a waltz, and the ladies, who had been some standing, some seated near him, were met by their partners and led into the mazy whirl. 
                  "You do not dance," she said to him, after they had taken seats, "else I should insist on your joining this waltz. See, how happy all these faces are! What smiles that we cannot interpret! What whispers that we cannot understand! What hand-pressures we cannot see nor feel! I wager that many a heart now thrills with love as the hot life-blood is quickened by those unseen touches! O, Mr. Harland, is it not strange that such trifles can make one so unspeakably happy?" She leaned over to him a little more, so that her shoulder almost touched his, and her handsome eyes were lusciously raised to his calm, dark face. 
                  "I do not call it a trifle, Mrs. Thornton," he remarked, thoughtfully gazing down upon the handsome, languid beauty by his side. "Every passion of our soul, every thought in our mind, has a language of its own by which it makes itself understood. A pressure of the hand, the stamping of the foot, the frown, the sneer, the smile, the look, are but a few of the thousand mediums through which our passions speak and our thoughts translate themselves. The touch itself, which you say can make one so unspeakably happy, would be a trifle indeed, were it not the mute language of the soul, capable of sending a message of love with all its attending ecstacy to the yearning heart without any further agency. No, Mrs. Thornton, a touch can scarcely be thought a trifle, when we consider it has the power to send the blood warm through our veins and transplant us into the seventh heaven, or can chill our heart to the core, extinguish the light of hope, and seal up for ever the fountain of our joys and happiness." 
                  "Mr. Harland," she said, quite entranced at the manner and matter of his speech, and after she had watched the mazy waltz for a brief space-"Mr. Harland, I am both proud and happy in the privilege of listening to your eloquence. Your remarks are so full of truth, beauty and poetry, that I can scarcely find sufficient words to express and assure you of the pleasure I am deriving from them. But it is strange to me, sir,-and I trust you will pardon me for my curiosity-that a person whose gifts of nature and of study attractive as yours are, should abstain from enjoying the pleasures a fond, willing and yearning heart swelling in the bosom of some fair maiden, should feel more than blessed to share with you. No, do not think me inquisitive-at least not more so than is generally attributed to our sex-if I beg of you the reason why you refrain from dancing? Is it perhaps because you cannot dance, or that it is against your principles-your religion?" 
                  "No, no, Mrs. Thornton," he said, quietly, "it is on account of neither. There was a time when I did dance, and even enjoyed it much. But that time is passed-passed never more to return. You see," he added, smiling, "I am no longer a child-no longer of the age in which dancing affords that pleasure one in younger years derives from it. I am getting old, Mrs. Thornton, and though I love to watch others in their exhibition of the grace of motion, I would no longer join in it myself." 
                  She laughed-laughed loud and musically, as she playfully raised a soft, white, cambric handkerchief to her face, and said:- 
                  "Why would you no longer join in it yourself? Don't say that you are too old to dance, for gentlemen twice your age would laugh at the assertion. Why, Mr. Thornton, who is nearly if not already fifty, still dances. O, if you were my husband-" and here she raised her soft and languid eyes to his thoughtful face, "I should tease the very life out of you until you would lay aside that reserve and assume that spirit-that physical activity-which in a person like yourself would be enough to create and keep alive in me-O, Mr. Harland, what a strange, irresistible power and influence you men can exercise over us!" 
                  She lowered her head upon her heaving bosom, and her jeweled fingers began to play with the rich folds of her dress. She heaved a soft sigh; at least Mr. Harland fancied to have heard one rising plaintively to his ear. He could account for it in no other way than by supposing-why he supposed so he did not take the time to investigate-that her married life, the life of that gay woman by his side, had perhaps a dark shadow crawling, unperceived by the world, between itself and the sun that were to give it warmth. Where was her husband? Why had he absented himself when he was aware of, and had himself given, the invitation to the guests assembled in his house? Why had he not joined them at supper? Why had he not made arrangements so he could at least be present now? All this flashed across Harland's mind at once and strengthened him in his opinion. He did not fancy for a moment that he himself was the shadow that stood between Lucretia Thornton and her husband. He did not dream of the passion he had unconsciously awakened in her bosom, and in order to satisfy the cravings of which she had recklessly determined upon a course of conduct that in its wild progress could but entail misery to herself and upon him she had set her mind upon bringing to her feet. 
                  "I must confess," he said, after a short pause, as she raised her eyes once more to his, "that man can exercise a great influence, either for good or evil, over the fairer and gentler sex; but it is equally as true that the influence of woman over man is far greater. How many miseries could be averted on either side if we but understood our respective missions, and exercised our influence timely and properly! Who could not recall to his memory events-sad, sad events-that the influence, the irresistible power, of the opposite sex could not have changed had the inclination to do so been equal to that inherent power? I have no doubt that I should be a different man if I had a wife to make me happy and to please. She would, at all events, by her goodness, if she be good, and by her beauty, if she be beautiful, have it at command to raise me by those two powerful agents far above the ordinary class of men. What truly good woman could not lift the most trifling being, if she but understood how, from the pit in which he has fallen? Yes; what truly good woman, if she could not raise the man she loved to that moral worth her influence over him should have been able to effect, would not feel a secret satisfaction-a holy consolation-at the many attempts she had made? Her influence over man is great, and will, notwithstanding its apparent ill-success, reap sooner or later a munificent reward. This thought alone should keep the spark of hope alive in woman's breast, and paint the future with brighter colors than disappointments and adverse fortunes throw around the present." 
                  "Mr. Harland," she said, after silently watching the play of his handsome features, "it is a lucky thing for you that I am a married woman. Were I single I should throw myself at your feet and worship you, but as I am married, and owe obedience and fidelity to my husband, I can only offer you-what I have a right and am still able to offer you-my sisterly love and everlasting friendship. Accept it, Mr. Harland, accept it and make me happy." 
                  She held out her hand to him as they sat side by side, and he took it between his fingers and held it tenderly for a moment. "You accept it, then?" she said, as she felt his soft touch, that sent a thrill through her bosom, and made her wish her own husband at the bottom of the sea. 
                  "Yes, I accept it, Mrs. Thornton," he replied, relinquishing his hold on her hand, "and trust that during my stay in this city I shall give you no cause to regret the undeserved kindness you have shown in honoring me with your friendship." 
                  The waltz was at an end, the music ceased, and the dancers, all flushed and panting were leaving the floor, and taking seats in pairs around the room. Mr. Harland raised his eyes and watched the dispersing group with some interest. Close to the door, in conversation with Mr. Wilhoyte, he beheld a lady he had not observed until now. He could see, that while she was listening to his friend, her eyes were bent toward him. "Who is yon handsome woman by the side of Mr. Wilhoyte? She must have entered during the dance, else I should have noticed her before now," he asked. 
                  "Why, Mr. Harland," she said, with a smile, "this is my daughter-Miss Thornton. I did not think she would join us this evening, as she complained of an head-ache. But why do you look at me so strangely? Is it because I call that tall lady my daughter, though from her looks one would scarcely think her a child of mine? And, in fact, she is not. She is simply my step-daughter. Come, allow me to present you to her." Now she rose, and a moment later, her arm resting in his, Mrs. Thornton crossed the room and presented him to her daughter. 
                  "This is Mr. Harland, Ruth-" here he changed color, for at that instant he recognized in that pensive, stately woman before him Ruth Arnold, his foster-sister-" who is honoring us with his presence. I take pleasure in introducing him to you. But I see you are just now trying to make Mrs. Wilhoyte jealous, and as I, like the rest of my sex, find a grim pleasure in seeing a jealous woman, I would not disturb your tete-a-tete that is so eagerly watched from the opposite side by the lady in question. So come along, Mr. Harland, and see what effect your efforts can produce upon my humble self, in my unprotected state." 
                  She laughed and hurried Clermont Harland away, but not until he had once more looked into the face of Ruth, and read unhappiness thereon. From the moment of his recognizing his foster-sister, a feeling of uneasiness had come over him. He tried his best to conceal it from his hostess, but he felt that he failed in the attempt. It was eight years since he had seen Ruth, and the whole Past, with its sad lessons, came back afresh to his memory, and made him, against his will, inattentive and absent-minded. Mrs. Thornton perceived the change, and attributed it to something she might have said to offend him. She grew reserved on her part, and determined upon finding out the cause of this strange transition. 
                  "Mr. Harland," she said, almost in a whisper, as they stopped before the window overlooking a garden, whose tall trees were reaching out their stiff, naked arms in all directions, "I have offended you in something, and my heart feels as numbed and cold as these branches around which the night-wind moans of the dead and the dying. Tell me how I have courted your displeasure, and I will sue for pardon." She pressed his hand for a moment, then turned a little to one side and lowered her head upon her bosom. 
                  Clermont Harland felt guilty of an impropriety. He had been too much taken up by his own thoughts to remember the attention he owed to the lady to whom he must have shown himself rude, else she would not have noticed the change that had taken place in his conduct. "A thousand pardons," he said, the blood for a moment rising to his cheeks, "a thousand pardons, Mrs. Thornton. I am the offender, not you. I blush to plead guilty of having allowed my mind to wander back over scenes where the brightest of my hopes lie buried, at a time when common politeness should have taught me to close my eyes to all save you to whom I owe the honor of my presence here." 
                  "I will not listen to you further," she interrupted him with a smile, her eyes raised to his, "I am happy in knowing that I have not offended you, and only regret that your mind should be able to call up any but pleasant, joyful images of the past. You owe me no apology, and-I shall listen to none. If some of your brightest hopes lie buried in the silent tomb of recollection, rest assured that a man like you has lost but little, as long as his heart is untouched, or not given away to one who is unworthy of such a rich treasure. O, Mr. Harland, we have all our sorrows, and many a soft and dimpled cheek is hiding and laughing over a skeleton frame." 
                  Mr. Rosegay, unquestionably one of the wisest and handsomest of men in his own estimation, which opinion of himself however, was quite in conflict with the opinion of the rest of mankind, Mrs. Rosegay not excepted, here came up with all the pomposity his self-importance could call into requisition, and politely tapping his little round fat hand on Mrs. Thornton's arm, and placing his little fat, rosy face over Mrs. Thornton's shoulders, informed Mrs. Thornton, in a voice half singing, half giggling, that the sets for the polks were forming, and the musicians were simply waiting on her to join the dance. 
                  "But my dear Mr. Rosegay," she said, "I'm not going to dance to-night. You must excuse me, indeed, and try to fill up the set without me. Will you not do that much for me, Mr. Rosegay?" 
                  She leaned over toward him, slipped her white, taper-fingers in his little fat, chunky hand, and smiled what she deemed an irresistible smile upon the fat little man. But it wouldn't do. My dear Mr. Rosegay wouldn't be put off in this manner. Highly as he appreciated that sly pressure given by her hand, and that delicious smile that made him feel as if he were bathing in a tub of oil, he was not quite willing to give up the polka she had promised him, and of which he had acquainted every one in the room something like an hour ago. No, it wouldn't do. He couldn't make a laughing-stock of himself; besides, his wife would torment him to the latest day of his life if he should allow himself to be snubbed. Mrs. Thornton has to dance with him, and that's the end of the matter. 
                  "My dear Mrs. Thornton," he said, his fat, rosy cheeks hastily retreating in the direction of his yellow whiskers as he opened his mouth to exhibit a two hundred and fifty dollar set of teeth, "I can not excuse you-indeed I can not. There is no other lady in the room, if I even were inclined to relinquish you, with whom I could fill the set. See, they are all waiting on you. Come, come, my dear Mrs. Thornton, and make us all happy. I am sure Mr. --, what is his name?-I am sure he will excuse you. Will you not, sir?" 
                  "Most certainly, Mr. Rosegay," Clermont Harland replied, "I should be sorry to be the cause of the least interruption. Mrs. Thornton-," this to his charming hostess, "however great my loss, I am willing to bear it since I feel satisfied it will further the happiness and enjoyment of the rest. I see they are waiting for you to join; let me not deprive them of your company." 
                  "But Mr. Harland," she insisted, "I really don't feel like dancing, and Mr. Rosegay, my dear Mr. Rosegay, must excuse me. I am certain if he takes the least pains he can still find some unengaged lady in this room, who would be happy to dance a polka with the best dancer on the floor." Mr. Rosegay bowed low-as low as his fat little body would allow. "Why, there sits my daughter all alone! Mr. Rosegay! Dear Mr. Rosegay! Gallant Mr. Rosegay! How can you stand idle here and ask me for a dance-me, an old woman who can not even appreciate the honor you mean to bestow-while a young lady who is even now looking at you and is yearning to dance with you, is still waiting for a partner? Are you not ashamed of yourself? I have a good mind to be offended at you." 
                  "Miss Thornton does never dance," he replied. "You ought to know this even better than I do." 
                  "Try her once. Faint heart never won fair lady, you know," she said, laughing. 
                  Even good, jolly Mr. Rosegay could at times evince a little anger and impatience, and the contraction of his round, thick-lipped mouth was one of the first moves by which he fortified himself against one and all attacks. Lucretia Thornton knew his humor, and now saw at the first glance that the little fat man's ire was aroused. Sooner than to lose his friendship she would yield to his wishes, and consequently passed her hand under his arm, and with another of her killing smiles made the heart leap in that little man's bosom, and his little gray eyes twinkle in their sockets between his little fat pug nose. 
                  "You are quite irresistible," she said to him, then bowing low to Mr. Harland, suffered dear Mr. Rosegay to lead her to the incompleted set. 
                  Once more music resounded through the room; once more the young and old were passing through the poetry of motion. Clermont Harland, left alone, felt quite relieved. He could not have endured that lively woman's conversation much longer. He had looked into his foster-sister's sad face-the foster-sister he had loved as a child, and who had warned him, on the day of her departure from Cincinnati with her uncle, Mr. Norton, not to marry Hannah Preston-and the past, with its sad history, now rushed back, most vividly, to his memory. How much he had suffered within those eight years he had not seen her! Had she been happy? Or had she had also to drink from the chalice of misery? He looked into her face-a terribly quiet, sad face-and his heart misgave him. Ruth was not happy. He could see it; he could feel it. 
                  His mind was made up. He would have speech with her. She had not recognized him, and he intended that his real name should never more be resurrected either to her or to any one else. Edgar Armhold's name died with Edgar Armhold's hopes; he would meet and speak to her as Clermont Harland. 
                  Louder and louder swelled the music; wilder and wilder grew the assembly. Ruth raised her deep black eyes, as she blushingly welcomed Clermont Harland to her side. 
                  A man of his information, knowledge and worldly experience, found it not difficult to enter upon a conversation that proved both entertaining and instructive to his listener. Finding her not of a communicative disposition, he introduced simply such topics which required no particular comment or answer. He would now and then refer to some incidents of his travels, or dwell upon topics more directly connected with some persons he had had the pleasure of meeting here this evening, but at no time did he forget the observance of those well-timed pauses, that a skillful conversationalist allows to intervene between the termination of one topic and the introduction of another. He had no particular desire for a display either of his mental or personal charms. Years, long years ago, he had lost all ambition to shine as a luminary among the bright lights in the firmament of intellect. He was, in this happy assembly, perhaps the only one whose every hope was crushed beyond the remotest chance of resuscitation, and yet the mastery he had over his feelings, and the discretion he had displayed from the moment he had said farewell, some six years before, to his home, in never speaking, to a single living being, of his own private affairs and troubles, concealed successfully the numberless struggles he had overcome-the bitter anguish that had wrung, and was still wringing, blood-tears from his heart. This unexpected meeting with his foster-sister had once more opened the wound he had fancied to be healed; and all the while he had been by the side of gay Mrs. Thornton, forced to listen to her words, his thoughts had been calling up the past, and traveling far and fast over time, space and distance, to that home and its inmates he had so strangely left-to that home and its inmates he had vowed never more to see. A feeling of kinship-a sensation he had thought impossible to be reawakened in his bosom-had drawn him now to his foster-sister Ruth, and made him look upon her with that joy the husbandman must feel whose drought-visited acres show him an uninjured, ripe, and pregnant stalk that has escaped the general devastation. But as he now looked at her, as he now spoke to her and observed her more closely, his own sadness increased, for her words, actions, smiles-her whole facial expression-said to him, as plain as signs could tell, that beneath that blooming exterior a cankering worm infected the heart within. Though unacquainted with her griefs, he pitied her from his very soul, and mentally extended to her the sympathies only a man of his delicacy and sensibility can feel for a suffering fellow-being. Having spoken to her now on several topics, and flattering himself of having gained her attention and awakened an interest for his conversation, he was bold enough, however cautiously, to contract the limits of his remarks, until they at last narrowed down to the respective parties in the room-to Mr. Stephens, to Mr. Rosegay, to Mr. Wilhoyte, to Ruth herself. 
                  "And you say you have once resided in the States?" he repeated, after he had led her to confess some of her past life. 
                  "Yes, I lived for several years among strangers in the city of Cincinnati," she replied, little dreaming that her remarks were addressed to a person in whose father's house she had found a home. 
                  "You must have been quite young, Miss Thornton," he remarked, "when you came to live, as you have said, among strangers." 
                  "O, I was a mere child," she added, "when I was taken there. I was only something like four years old when my uncle brought me to Cincinnati." 
                  Here was an opportunity offered him to inquire into the reason of her having been sent away from her home at so early a stage in her life, but with his characteristic tact, Clermont Harland did not suffer his curiosity to take advantage of a remark that would have made such an inquiry most pardonable, but which nevertheless would never have been uttered had such a probability been only surmised. Wisely he passed over it and said: 
                  "I doubt not but what you have forgotten those childish events that must have made up your daily life, while away from home." 
                  "Why do you think so, Mr. Harland? I have always heard it said, and I can affirm to the truth of it, by my own limited experience, that the recollection of our childhood, though crowded back or pressed down by subsequent and graver events, will now and then, like bright lights across the midnight heaven, flash and dart across memory's clouded firmament, with a vividness that dispels the mist and darkness time has suffered to gather over it. Forgotten the events of the long-gone past? Ceased to recollect the brightest, the happiest, days I ever had, or ever will have again, in all my life? No, Mr. Harland, I have not forgotten them. The good people with whom I lived, though now dead and buried, shall ever be remembered, and have my prayers for the love and kindness they have shown me at all times." 
                  "It is a beautiful trait in our character," Harland ventured to say, diving deeper into this discussion, "to feel a pleasure in remembering kindnesses shown to us in our earlier years; to remember them, too, when the parties themselves have gone to their final rest, and we-we-are basking in the sunshine of our own happiness, prospering in the bright smiles of fortune and success. Were you long away from home, Miss Thornton?" 
                  "I was taken to Mr. Armhold's," she replied, "when I was only something like four years old, and remained at his house until both he and his wife had been laid in their cold graves, at which time their son Edgar provided another home for me, from which my uncle took me away some eight years ago. In all I was something like six years among strangers." 
                  "Pardon me, Miss Thornton," he continued, a faint smile lighting up for a moment the classic features of his handsome face, "for displaying a little curiosity in your remarks. You tell me that you were brought as child away from your home to live with strangers, among whom you had remained something like six years, and whose kindness toward you still lived fresh in your memory. It is not often that strangers take a deep interest in the welfare of others, unless selfish motives advise such a manifestation, and it is therefore the more welcome when we find it pure and sincere. I trust that your second home was no less agreeable to you." 
                  "Do you refer to my removal to Mr. Preston's-for that is the residence to which I was introduced by Mr. Edgar Armhold after the death of his parents?" she inquired. 
                  "I do." 
                  "Well," Miss Thornton replied, "coming as I did, a poor, forlorn girl, without the slightest shadow of a claim upon their generosity, among Mr. Preston's family, it is nothing but justice to give them the highest credit for the manner in which they have treated me. One and all were kind to me, never, in word or act, making me feel, and impressing on my mind, the fact that I was simply a dependent. But O! what a vast difference between that home and the home I had had at the Armhold's! Mr. Harland, you are a gentleman, who, as I am told, and as I can hear by your conversation, have seen much of the world, and come in contact with all grades and classes of society. Perhaps you can understand the difference. It is not every person, you know, who can distinguish a difference between good treatment and good treatment. At the house of Mr. Armhold I met, as I should have met in the houses of all the poor, the wealth of the heart, shared that pure and unselfish love which sprung from misfortune and oppression, and was the only solace in their greatest tribulations. Each word, each smile, each tear, each bit of advice, each reprimand rose from a soul of love and sympathy, and went straight to the heart, awakening a responsive feeling. There was so much affection in every thing that was done and said-such a peculiar nearness and interest manifested in the consultation of the most trifling as in the most important topic, as if each member of the household was directly concerned in it. Joys and sorrows were shared alike, and the whole family was as one body, moved as by one feeling, and governed as by one mind. Mr. Harland, Mr. Harland, I shall never see such happy times again." 
                  "O, Miss Thornton," he replied, "do not say so. I do not see why you should not enjoy yourself now. To be at home-at the home where the father and mother live-where the love and protection of those to whom we owe our life follow us at our every step, must outweigh all other considerations." 
                  "I agree with you, Mr. Harland," she said, sadly, "there is no such place like home, and yet-" 
                  "And yet how few appreciate the saying! It is only when too late, when the grave covers those kind old faces, and a little white slab shows the wayfarer where the dear old mother and father are laid to rest; when we have ceased to be children and are thrown out into the world, that we miss this unselfish love and sympathy, and shudder and shed tears at the coldness and want of feeling we are destined to meet whichever way we turn our feet. It is only then, Miss Thornton, that our heart goes to mourning, and our mind calls up the thousand trivial kindnesses we failed to appreciate on account of their frequent repetitions. It is only then that experience teaches us, to our sorrow, how little we understood the value of a mother's, of a father's, love. Go from one end of the world to the other, Miss Thornton, and gather all the love that the whole human family cherishes for a stranger, and place that love by the side of that of a mother, and it will pale away at its sight, like the faintest shadow with the approach of the fiery day-god in the clear meridian sky. O, cherish your home, Miss Thornton, cherish it, and be happy." 
                  As she listened to what she considered words of wisdom and inspiration, her thoughts unconsciously reverted to the troubles and suspicions she had harbored against her own father, and her heart smote her for her un-daughter-like conduct. Why should she distrust him? What interest could he have in deceiving her? What right had she to doubt his love for her? Had he not always been good to her? Always gratified even her slightest wish? And yet-and yet these doubts were not yet entirely chased away; Mr. Arnold-the name by which she had once been known herself-and his conversation in regard to that crazy woman still obtruded themselves in her mind, and connected themselves with her own destiny. 
                  "Mr. Harland," she replied, after both had been watching the progress of the dance for some time, and she was once more gazing into his face, "do not think for a moment that I do not cherish and appreciate the advantages of a home. I do not deny that the days I have spent at the Armholds were the happiest I have ever known, and that I shall never be as sorrow-free again. But tell me, Mr. Harland," she added, trying to call a smile to her face, "does not a cloudlet sometimes obscure the brightest star? And is it not possible that even a home, with all its love and tenderness, may have its cloudlet to chill its atmosphere now and then?" 
                  "It is not only possible," replied Harland, "but probable, that the happiest hearth is surrounded by a damp, chill air. But how many of us, basking in the warmth and sunshine of those who love us most unselfishly, exaggerate our grievances, and censure by suspicion wrongs but living in our imagination?" 
                  "But is it not possible, Mr. Harland," she inquired, "that a parent might wrong a child?" 
                  "In haste, yes; but no sooner has the heart had time to appeal to itself, than all selfishness will be thrown aside, and the child will find a parent's bosom still the only sanctuary where it may have its prayers heard. A mother-" 
                  "Yes, but I have only a step-mother." 
                  Here Ruth was interrupted. The polka was at an end, and Mrs. Thornton, leaning on the arm of my "dear Mr. Rosegay," approached them from the crowd. She was flushed, and her rosy face, exposing a row of pearly teeth, was wreathed in smiles. She laughed and chatted with animation, and a mischievous glance shot from her eyes. But no sooner had she seen her daughter's face than a feeling of jealousy swelled within her breast, and sent a pang to her heart. 
                  "O, what a pity it is," she commenced, as she stopped in front of Clermont Harland, "that you do not dance. See how happy I have made Mr. Rosegay. Have I not done so, Mr. Rosegay?" The gentleman nodded assent, and grinned from ear to ear, while her own voice, with a skillfully-affected hilarity, sent its silver music through the drawing-room. "I have a good mind," she continued, "to punish you severely for your old bachelor ways. Come, Mr. Harland, and confess your guilt. Are you not inclined to a little selfishness by depriving my lady-friends-all of whom are anxious, as you can see, to have you for a brief time in custody-the pleasure of your conversation? Here is Miss Clark quite angry at me for not introducing you to her. Were it not for my discinlination to rob Miss Thornton, I should at once take charge of you myself and make you ashamed for your reticence." 
                  Clermont Harland smiled. 
                  "If I could be vain enough," he replied, "to suppose that my presence would add to the pleasure of any lady, I should feel doubly happy in the thought of having engaged the attention of Miss Thornton. However, as a wise diplomatist, I shall retire before I weary. Miss Thornton"-this to Ruth, whose dreamy black eyes were quietly, immovably, resting upon his own undisturbed features-"allow me to thank you for your attention. I hope to have the pleasure of paying my addresses to you once more before I depart." 
                  Ruth rose, bowed, then sat down again. Her eyes followed the receding form of her step-mother, who, by some jugglery or other, had got rid of Mr. Rosegay, and now was leaning on Clermont's arm. She was leading him to a seat a little apart from the rest, and quite in the opposite direction from where Miss Clark-a little, mischievous and bright-eyed girl-was impatiently waiting for the introduction that Mrs. Thornton had so faithfully and confidentially promised her. 
                  "Baby Clark," she said now, as she languidly threw herself upon the seat touching Clermont's, "must wait for an introduction until I have rested. I am really tired and worn out from this dance. I hope, Mr. Harland, you will content yourself with my company for a few moments. I know an old married woman can offer little inducement toward the entertainment of a handsome cavalier like yourself. Come, Mr. Harland, will you put up with my nonsense for a few minutes longer?" 
                  "I enjoy myself too much in your own society," he replied, "to have the least desire to exchange it for that of the handsomest and wittiest young lady in this chosen assembly." 
                  A smile wreathed the scarlet lips of the siren matron by his side. A lascivious fire was lighting up her mischievously-ogling eyes, as she placed her soft, jeweled hand upon his arm, and said: 
                  "I'll put you to the test, and see how much dependence can be placed in your professions. If my company can add in the least to your enjoyment, I shall think this social gathering"-here she faltered, looked for a moment shyly into his eyes, then lowered her head and studied the carpet under her feet-"I shall think this social gathering the most successful one ever given under the auspices of Mr. and Mrs. Thornton." 
                  Clermont Harland bowed, and, in fitting words, acknowledged the compliment. Inwardly he smiled, for, not suspecting his hostess of a guilty thought, he placed her in the category of those sentimental matrons who try to make up in their married life for the reserve they had to show in their youth on occasions when their very heart's desire pointed to the most opposite extreme. Hence he encouraged her advances, little dreaming of the breakers he was nearing. 
                  "My happiness is complete, indeed," he said, "to know myself the center object of your interest on this happy occasion. I assure you this undeserved consideration brings me under obligations to you, a life-time of devotion even can not repay. I only regret the absence of Mr. Thornton himself, who would have felt no little pride in finding his wife the life and light of this whole assembly." 
                  From any one else she would have received this flattering remark with that indifference to praise a spoiled and patted beauty loves to exhibit before an admirer whose attention is simply suffered and encouraged as long as some pleasure or advantage can be derived from it, but emanating as it did from Clermont Harland-the man whose very word could send a thrill of ecstacy through her feverish blood-she felt herself transported almost beyond endurance. She raised her eyes to his face, heaved a gentle sigh, then shook her head in sadness. 
                  "Mr. Harland," she said after a pause, once more calling a smile to her lips, and exposing her laughing white teeth, "are you a judge of human nature? And can you read the heart of woman?" 
                  "Indeed, Mrs. Thornton," he replied, "my pretensions to that art are not very great but I have often wished to possess the skill of looking into a pure woman's heart, so I could see that world of love which manifests itself in all her actions." 
                  "I wish you would read mine, Mr. Harland." 
                  "I wish so too, for a lady, happy as you are, must have a heart welling over with love." 
                  "Who tells you that I am happy?" 
                  "Grief was never yet hidden beneath so unclouded a brow." 
                  "I wish from the depth of my heart, I could coincide with you. But I can not. My own experience, my own life, tells me, Mr. Harland, what a bitter, disgraceful lie we are continually called upon to live. You see me smile, and hear me laugh, and straight you jump at the conclusion that Mrs. Lucretia Thornton is a happy woman. But tell me, sir, I pray you, how a woman can be happy-" 
                  She could not speak the rest. By her side stood a bright-eyed little girl. It was Susie Clark. Her patience had given out, and she came to be introduced to the handsome stranger. Mrs. Thornton blushed, and excused herself for not having come up to her promise. 
                  "Never mind," said the little witch Susie, "it is never too late to do good." 
                  Susie Clark was accordingly introduced to Clermont Harland, and her little, laughing, rosy mouth could scarcely repress a smile, as she, unasked, drew a chair near that of Clermont, and said, "I do all this to spite you, Mrs. Thornton. You know I love to aggravate you. I don't intend that you should have Mr. Harland all to yourself. The other girls are all too timid to give expression to their disappointment. But you see, I mustered up enough courage to break up your tete a tete. So the best thing you can do, is to take me into your confidence at once. But before you proceed with your conversation, allow me to put a question to Mr. Harland. Will you answer it?" 
                  "Certainly, I shall answer it with the greatest pleasure." 
                  "Are you offended with my boldness? Now answer me sincerely," and she looked at him with a countenance as open as unvarnished truth and as bright as day itself. "No?" and she smiled with her whole face. "No? I thought you wouldn't feel offended, and I have told them so. But they wouldn't believe me; so I told them that you had the looks of a real gentleman, and no true gentleman would misconstrue the motives of any lady. Would he, Mr. Harland?" 
                  "No, Miss Clark," he replied, smiling, pleased with her artless volubility. "A gentleman will consider every woman a lady, until her conduct forfeits his esteem." 
                  "I am glad to hear you say so, for now I feel at my ease, for I have only offended by a breach of etiquette. I should have waited until you were introduced to me according to established rules, but indeed, indeed, I could not wait any longer, so I came unasked and uncalled. Pray, Mr. Harland, say once more that I am pardoned, and I will punish myself by growing as reserved as Miss Ruth, upon whom, judging by her own remarks, you must have left an extremely favorable impression." 
                  "In order to deserve that compliment," he replied, graciously smiling, "I shall beg you to let your happy nature unbridled speak the innocence of your young soul. Why not be merry? Yes, laugh and be joyous, Miss Clark, for base and corrupted must be that man, indeed, who would wish to shorten even by a moment's duration the happiness of youth, beauty, and innocence." 
                  At that moment the door opened, and as Mrs. Thornton's attention was turned in that direction, the color fled from her cheeks, and her thin lips began to quiver from emotions of fear and apprehension. 
                  Mr. Archibald Thornton could not have arrived at a more inopportune time. Though attired with that neatness and propriety consistent with his age and profession, and with his customary pleasant smile resting upon his closely-shaven face, nodding, now here, now there, greeting first this one, then that one, as he crossed the room, never suspected, even for a moment, that the woman upon whom he doted and whom he worshiped despite her love of dress, coquetry, and admiration, was the least pleased of all with his unexpected arrival. She considered it an intrusion for which she almost hated him. After being absent to so late an hour, what business had he to come in now and mar her pleasure? Could he not have remained in his own room, and been content to know that his wife and daughter could very well make out without him? No! he had to come in and show his hateful face just-yes, just when she had Mr. Harland once more by her side. 
                  Such thoughts, and others equally as flattering to her husband, arose in her mind as Mr. Archibald Thornton stopped in front of her, receiving of the trio-his wife, Clermont Harland, and the lively Susie Clark-the salutation of the evening, with that unaffected grace and self-assurance a man of the world, conscious of his position, never forgets to exhibit. He sat down by them, and joined their conversation, which turned now into different channels, and was chiefly sustained by Clermont Harland and Susie Clark. Mrs. Thornton had little to say. She was listening with the profoundest interest to every word that fell from Clermont's lips, but no sooner would her husband offer a remark, however well-timed, judicious, and to the point, than a frown would sweep across her brow, as if even to listen to his voice was enough to irritate her. In blissful ignorance of his wife's feelings toward him, Mr. Thornton remained by her side until the music, once more vibrating through this splendid hall, called the dancers to the floor. It caused a slight interruption in their conversation-this hurrying now here, now there, from this and from that corner-which Mrs. Thornton was determined to put to good account. She would rid herself, by one means or another, from the presence of both her husband and Susie Clark. In regard to the latter she needn't to have troubled her mind. Susie was engaged for this waltz, and before Mrs. Thornton had time to shape her plans, was claimed by a young gentleman, on whose arm she lightly tripped across the room. 
                  "Since you do not dance," Mrs. Thornton said to Clermont, who was watching for a moment the forming of the circle, "let us walk, for I'm tired of sitting, into the adjoining room, from where we can undisturbedly watch the progress of the waltz." 
                  Suiting the action to the word she made a motion to rise, both Mr. Thornton and Mr. Harland following the example-the latter offering her his arm, while the former, on inquiry from his wife whether he had seen Ruth, wished them much enjoyment, then turned his steps in search of his daughter. 
                  He found her on her feet-all by herself-eagerly looking in every direction except in the one from which he was advancing. At last she turned her face; it was sad and thoughtful-sad as that of her own poor mother's on the day when she was first told that she had to be sent to an asylum-but it lighted up the moment she espied him. She hastened to his side, and passed her hand under his arm. 
                  "O, I'm so glad, you've come, father," she said, as she drew him along and stopped before a couple of chairs, upon which they sat down, "I have been wishing to see you all evening." 
                  "Indeed, daughter?" 
                  "Yes, father," she said, raising her deep, black eyes to his face, "I have been praying-from my very heart praying-for your return. Give me your hand, father. Say, will you forgive me? Say, will you pardon me for what has transpired between us last night? O, do; for God's sake, do! You don't know how much I have reproached myself for my undaughterlike conduct. I don't know for the life of me what had put that silly idea in my head. My mother is dead-I know she is, and to have suspected you of--O, father! father! how wicked I was to suspect you of wrong." 
                  Tears came into her eyes; they glimmered like so many bright diamonds. Archibald Thornton saw them, and something like a feeling of compunction entered his heart, but even at this moment he did not forget himself. He remained calm, cool, and collected. What he felt and knew, not face, nor speech, nor manner of his should betray. Would that he loved his daughter less, so he could be more hardened, and act the hypocrite to greater perfection. But with all his crimes, that weighed down his soul and his want of sympathy for all mankind, he loved his daughter-even better than his wife-and if ever he felt his conscience rise up against his crimes it was at this moment, his own Ruth-the child of that wretched woman, toward whom he had been such a remorseless fiend-looking full of love, faith, and confidence into his half-averted eyes. 
                  "Yes, father," she continued, after a short pause, and a faint smile lighted up her face, relaxing the severity of its features, "I know you will forgive your daughter Ruth, and once more take her into your grace." 
                  "Do you know," answered Mr. Thornton, in a low, impressive voice, "that our interview of last night was the cause of considerable mortification to me? I was not then able to give expression to my injured feelings. I am calmer now, Ruth-so are you-and I will not conceal from you that a repetition of--" 
                  "Father," she interrupted him in the middle of that sentence, "do not threaten me even with your anger, if you love me. Here I swear never more to think or speak of such nonsense again. I know I have been rude, insulting, and unwarrantably suspicious toward you. But do not blame me, father. It is my nature, my disposition, not only to make myself, but all those who have the misfortune to surround me, feel miserable. Do you know, father, what I think at times?" she interrupted herself, and her face grew once more sad and thoughtful. "I have frequently heard it said, and you yourself have told me so often, that my mother"-this in a whisper-"had been deranged. Father! father!-"a chill crept through his frame-"the morbid condition of my mind-is it not a kind of insanity?" 
                  Even the heart of Archibald Thornton was moved. He could not hear his own child speak in this manner. Accusing herself of having wronged him, and asking forgiveness of him for having hinted at suspicions which he knew were too well founded in truth, was almost more than he could endure. He could have braved her anger far easier than this humble acknowledgment and confiding simplicity. His crime of deception seemed to him so much greater and more horrible. So much love and confidence on one side!-so much sin, injury, and deception on the other! He thought over it, and felt the pang in his heart more sensibly. How willingly he would have spared his daughter from further pain! But the exigency of his position would not admit of it. Something had occurred during the day that made a change of programme necessary. He had sacrificed Rachel's happiness to enjoy the love of Lucretia Broadwell. Now he was called upon to sacrifice the happiness of his daughter, else receive the punishment with which an exposure of Rachel's grave wrongs now threatened him. 
                  "Ruth," he said, kindly, calling up a smile to his face, and gently taking hold of her hand, "you must not utter such nonsense again. The insanity of your dear mother was not hereditary, but resulted from natural causes, which can not in the least affect your own mind, whose soundness, thank God, was never, and never will be, a question of doubt. So let us not dwell any longer upon such an unprofitable discussion, and oblige me by driving this ridiculous notion from your mind. I want you to be happy, daughter. Do you hear me, Ruth?" She nodded in assent, and smiled, as be continued: "The silly talk of last night is forgotten--" 
                  "And pardoned?" she interrupted him, her eyes lighting up with an inward joy. "And pardoned? Say yes, and-I shall be happy." 
                  She was happy; Archibald Thornton could see it, could read it, in every lineament of her face. He mastered his own feelings, which were almost sending tears of remorse into his eyes, and assumed a well-sustained show of liveliness. It would not do to arouse fresh suspicions now. 
                  "I say yes," he answered, "and you shall be happy. But I have a favor to ask of you, Ruth," he continued, coaxingly, "which you must grant me in satisfaction of these pardoned grievances. Say, will you oblige me with a favor?" 
                  "A thousand favors, not one, father," she answered, with a happy enthusiasm," and I only feel no less astonished than insulted even to have you to think-as if I had the right to do it!-I should be capable of hesitating a moment. Ask whatever you want of me-I know you can not ask any thing that would not advance my own happiness-and, here is my hand on it, I shall obey you to the very letter." She extended to him her hand, and while it still lay in his own, Archibald Thornton replied: 
                  "You are right, daughter, in saying that I could not ask any thing of you that might prove deterimental to your happiness. I love you too much, and think too much of your own welfare, not to enjoy your fullest confidence. What I want of you is this, my daughter." He moved a little closer to her side, then added in a lower key: "I want you to think of the future, daughter. See, I'm getting old, and, though still enjoying extreme good health, might at any moment be called away from you." Ruth's large black eyes filled with tears. "You have no brother, you have no sister, when I am dead and buried, to whom you might look for love, advice, and sympathy. It is true your dear mother will always be good to you, but she is yet young, and changes might take place--" 
                  "O, father, father," she uttered, from a heart wrung with grief, "do not speak of this. You can not know how deeply it affects me. I can not hear you hint at death and dying. You can live another fifty years, father-in all probability outlive me-why then frighten me with such a picture?" The tears were fast gathering in her eyes; she could feel them coursing down her cheeks, and, in order not to call any one's attention to herself, she lowered her head over her fast-heaving bosom, and shaded her brow with her hand. 
                  "I do not wish to frighten you, Ruth," Archibald Thornton continued, after a short pause, "but a wise man makes provisions for the future in time. He does not wait to the last moment, especially when the happiness of one he loves most and dearest is at stake. It is true that I might last another half-century, but the greater probability is that I shall live another few years, and my span of life is ended. No, I do not wish to frighten you. But I desire to prepare you for the necessity of a change. Besides, I should feel the happier myself by knowing your future secured, and your life the chiefest object-the object of a husband's solicitude. Do you understand me, Ruth? I should like to see you married. I am sure it must be your ambition-as it is the ambition of every true and good woman-sooner or later to establish a home of her own. I have been thinking of late a great deal in regard to this matter, and now I only hope that you will give this subject your earliest and most unprejudiced consideration, and thereby show me that love and obedience a dutiful daughter should not hesitate a moment to offer to a solicitous parent." 
                  He paused, and Ruth Thornton slowly raised her large black eyes, now dry and thoughtful, to her father's face. It was calm and unruffled, and its well-trained features, carefully subjected to his control, defied successfully her long and steady scrutiny. At last a smile wreathed her full red lips, and she said: "Are you then so tired of me, my father, that you would like to get rid of me so soon?" 
                  "No, daughter, no, it is not that. You are as dear to me as my very life, but you are just now in the full bloom of your youth-" a deep blush crimsoned her cheeks, and her heavy fringed eye-lids drooped lower and lower over those sad, dreamy orbs, "yes, in the first freshness of lovely womanhood, no less beautiful than your own dear mother was-" how his conscience smote him to make this confession-"when I saw her for the first time in my life. Now, daughter, is the very period for the exchanging of your heart; no more propitious season can ever be found. Now listen to me, Ruth, and let us speak to one another and discuss this matter as father and daughter should speak, with all truth and sincerity. No one is here to disturb us; even your step-mother's curiosity is not likely to be aroused here as readily as it might be were we to postpone it to another time. Yes, as I stated before, you are now in your freshest bloom, and of the age to marry-" 
                  "Father, please proceed no further in this conversation. I do not wish to marry yet, indeed I do not. Let me stay with you as long as I may: I desire no greater privilege." 
                  "I do not say, daughter," replied Archibald Thornton, smiling, "that you should marry at a moment's notice. No, Ruth, I do not wish you to misunderstand me. All I desire is that you should think over this matter with a view to better comprehend your father's motives, so that, should a suitable candidate offer himself, you will not be wholly unprepared to consider his claims." 
                  "Well, father," Ruth answered, good-humoredly, "whenever such a candidate does offer himself, of which, however, there is no likelihood for some time to come, if I may judge by the success I have had in the past in the line of fascinating, there will be plenty time to consider this matter. But I beg you, father, from my heart I beg you, to let this subject rest until then." 
                  "But, my dear Ruth, what would you say if I were to inform you that a candidate for your hand and heart is in the field, and has begged me to urge his claims to your kindest consideration?" 
                  Ruth Thornton turned pale, and a pang shot through her frame. Her eyes were inquiringly riveted to her father's face. At last the blood rushed back to her cheeks, and a smile lingered in the curves of her partly opened lips. "You are not serious, father," she said, half-questioning. "You are simply having your fun by trying how foolishly credulous I can be. Is it not so?" 
                  "Ruth, I am in the fullest earnest. There is a suitor for your heart and hand, and if you love me and wish to make me happy, you can do so, to my soul's content, by looking upon his offer in a favorable light." 
                  She was pale once more, and her hand slightly trembled in her father's. She turned her eyes away from him and for a moment watched the progress of the waltz. Mr. Thornton himself appeared to be busy with untwisting his watch-chain. 
                  "Father!" 
                  He looked up, and encountered her pale, sad and thoughtful face. There was something recklessly resolute in its expression; something strangely suspecting in the steady glance of her eyes. He feared to have once more awakened a feeling of doubt in her naturally distrustful mind; and therefore felt his old wile and strength come back to him. He knew himself her match, and more than her match, as soon as she stood in opposition to him, and gave signs of independence and selfreliance. It was only her childish confidence in his love that could disarm him-that had disarmed him. 
                  "Who is the man that has applied to you for my hand?" she continued. 
                  "A man, Ruth, of whose love for you I am assured." This cool, quietly, and with all the affability of his winsome manners. 
                  "What is his name?" 
                  "You are not in the best of humor, daughter. I can see that in your looks, though, I'm sure. I have said nothing but what should have made your young heart flutter in your bosom. What lady of your age would not have had her vanity aroused by being told that a worthy gentleman would like to make her his wife? A gentleman against whom the voice of slander has never been raised-a gentleman, in fact, who is entitled to my friendship and your love." 
                  "His name, father!" 
                  "Will you listen to me calmly?" 
                  "Have I not listened to you calmly?" 
                  "You have, but it seemed to be rather the calmness of a willful obduracy than that of a contented spirit." 
                  "Father, do you wish me to smile?" she asked, considerably agitated. 
                  "Certainly, daughter, I want you to smile, and, more than that, I want you to be happy, continually happy." 
                  "Well, if you do wish me to be happy, drop this conversation at once." 
                  "I can not see in how far this conversation can possibly destroy your happiness." 
                  "Father, I do not wish to marry yet. I am perfectly satisfied with my home, unless you wish to get rid of me-you only need to say so, and I shall leave Thornton Mansion-" 
                  He laughed, laughed heartily, and took her hand between his own. "Want to get rid of you?" he exclaimed, in a half-suppressed voice. "Want to get rid of you? Why, my own dear Ruth, I really do fear you have a touch of madness in your temper? Want to get rid of you! It is just the very opposite to that I wanted and labored to effect. Fearing that I should have to lose you sooner or later, I heralded the good news that told me of a son-in-law, with whom you might enjoy, even long after I am dead and buried, my house and home. But come," he added, rising to his feet, "let us walk into the other room, and I shall explain myself better to you. See, Mr. Wilhoyte is turning this way; let us move around behind this circle." 
                  So saying, they hastened across the room, and disappeared among the several dancers, who, wearied and exhausted, were languidly moving to their seats. 
                  It was late that night when the party broke up. Mrs. Thornton, leaning on the arm of Clermont Harland, had seen Ruth leave the room, without bidding farewell to any one of her guests. She did not imagine that others had noticed her departure, and therefore was surprised, when her companion said: 
                  "I fear your daughter is ill, Mrs. Thornton. I have just had time to observe her face as she passed through this door, and I fancied to detect signs of pain on her features." 
                  Clermont had spoken but half the truth, for he had not only "fancied to detect signs of pain" on Ruth's face, but had really seen the tears as they glittered and trembled in her eyes. 
                  "Miss Thornton," replied Archibald's wife, "is subject to severe attacks of headache, and suffers considerably on that account. One would scarcely suppose that so majestic a figure should be continually troubled with bodily ailment. She has the constitution of her dead mother, and the physician fears that her life will be, I am sorry to say, but a brief one." 
                  She said nothing more. Ruth, if she should ever aspire to become her rival, is done for. No sensible man would ever marry a woman he knew to be sickly and ailing. 
                  "I assure you," Clermont Harland replied, his tender heart weeping tears of pity for his foster-sister, "that I sincerely sympathise with your esteemed daughter's state of health. I trust, however, that the future may disappoint her physician, and that many happy days may still be in store for her." 
                  They walked on in silence now, and passed into the group of visitors, who were already making preparations to leave. Clermont Harland found Mr. and Mrs. Wilhoyte waiting for him. He excused himself for this delay, and blamed Mrs. Thornton's charming society for his forgetfulness. 
                  Fifteen minutes later saw him, among the rest, leave the house. Mrs. Thornton followed him to the door, and when she shook his hand, and bade him call again, and whispered something in his ear that sent the blood to his cheeks, she did not think that Meely Broadwell stood by her side bitterly smiling like an arch-flend, while he drank in every word that fell from his unguarded sister's lips. 
                  When she met, some moments later, her husband in their room, she was so much occupied with her own thoughts, that she did not observe that he had aged ten years within an hour. No, she was too much engrossed with her own thoughts to find time to think of others. She made some few indifferent remarks, then retired, happier by far than she had been for years, to rest. 
                  "Here at least," said Archibald Thornton to himself, "is quiet. I am tired of this life and noise." 
                  "A little too quiet," thought his wife, who had been listening to his remarks, and was now thinking how much more happy that home would be if a child of here would bless it. 
                  With this thought she fell asleep. For long, long hours her husband, with a secret trouble on his mind, lay awake by her side, unconscious of his Lucretia's happiness, as she dreamed of Clermont Harland, the party, and a child that was calling her "mother." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER VI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              WHY am I mock'd with death, lengthened out 
                              To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet 
                              Mortality my sentence, and be earth 
                              Insensible, how glad would lay me down, 
                              As in my mother's lap; there I should rest 
                              And sleep secure. 
                           
                         
                        MILTON'S PARADISE LOST. 
                      
                   
                  WE will leave Mrs. Thornton to her happy dreams, and return, late as it is in the night, to her step-daughter, Ruth, whom we still find up, sitting before a bright fire kindled in her bed-chamber. She has not doffed the attire in which we have seen her at the party; has made no preparations yet to retire. Something rests heavily on her mind which would, where she even to seek her couch, keep her from sleeping. Her eyes are wide open and vaguely looking at the sporting, yellow flame-forks. No sighs escape her lips, no tear relieves her heart. The clock upon her mantel strikes eleven, twelve, one-strikes two, three, four, and still she is awake. The fire in the grate is dying out, the room is getting cold and chilly, and she rises from her seat, looks for a moment or two through the window into the dark, ominous outside, then returns to the hearth, places herself behind her chair, and once more she gazes into the grate, where nothing but gray ashes greet her sight. Her own face grows paler, quieter, and sterner, and her lips seem to move as if in the act of speaking, but no sound escapes them. 
                  Still she stands behind that chair, her hands resting on its back. She appears to grow taller, stiffer, more statuelike. Not a muscle moves in her face, not a breath disturbs the lips. For a moment she looks as if she had turned to stone, then her bosom swells and expands, she poises her head still higher, her dark eyes begin to sparkle, and the agony that weighs down her heart, is rising to her face, distorting its every feature, and robbing it of its calm. She heaves a long, painful sigh, mutters something to herself, then drops her head upon the back of her chair, and weeps and sobs. 
                  Her father had told her that Meely Broadwell had asked for her hand; she still remembers the conversation-still seems to hear him say, after she had informed him that she'd sooner die than marry Meely-"daughter, it is my desire, my hope, my only wish that you will consent to this marriage. If you can not love him, teach yourself to forget it, and be happy in the thought of having saved your father from a great-great peril. Refuse him, daughter, and Archibald Thornton's life will not be worth a penny. Shall I live or die." "Live, father, live; I shall marry Meely Broadwell." 
                  "God bless you, daughter." 
                  She remembers these words now, and weeps. She could have made no greater sacrifice had she given the last drop of blood to her father. She to marry Meely Broadwell! 
                  It strikes five. She leaves the chair, extinguishes the light, throws herself upon her couch, and tries to forget herself in sleep. 
                  It was late in the morning when she rose. Both her father and Meely Broadwell had left hours ago. In the dining-room, while taking her breakfast, she was informed by the servant, that her mother had gone out to call on the Wilhoytes. 
                  "In such weather as this?" exclaimed Ruth, for it was very slushy. 
                  "She went out in the carriage, Miss Ruth." 
                  An hour later, Ruth, notwithstanding the unfavorable weather, also left the house. Her heart was too much oppressed to let her rest at home. Every thing seemed too close and confining. She was after fresh air, after freedom-she wanted to forget herself, so she sallied out upon the street. She had no particular place to go to. It mattered little to her whither her feet led her. She would just as leave walk in one direction as in another, so she walked on now into this street now into that, and in something like an hour found herself almost at the outskirts of the city. She knew not which way to turn; she was lost! Every thing and every body seemed strange to her. It was so different here from the vicinity of her own home. The pavements were so narrow, the streets so irregular and the houses so low, dingy and dilapidated. 
                  Everything-even the strange faces staring at her-looked so ominous to her this gloomy morning. She shrank within herself and began to retrace her steps. Before she had gone two squares she stopped quite still, and one could see that she was growing paler. A moment later she doubled the veil over her face, then hurried on until she reached the corner of the square, when she stopped again, and looked along a narrow lane down which she had seen some one, whom she fancied she knew, hasten. "It is Meely," she said to herself, then followed him at a safe distance. Why she did so she knew not herself. Was it a fatality that she had come out here? 
                  Meely Broadwell passed through the lane, entered once more a long, narrow street-Ruth still following him unobserved-then stopped in front of John Harder's house. Five minutes later the door closed upon him. 
                  Ruth saw it and stopped. Her heart beat wildly, and a strange, unaccountable tremor shook her frame. What was Meely doing out here? she asked herself. Could her father have clients living in this neighborhood, the importance of whose case or cases required a personal visit of Meely Broadwell even in such disagreeable weather as this? Could it have something to do with that crazy woman? Could it? 
                  Had she asked herself why she waited something like an hour for the reappearance of Meely Broadwell, she could not have answered it satisfactorily to herself. But, nevertheless, she did wait; but Meely Broadwell didn't come. She grew impatient, but still she waited. 
                  At last the door opened, and Meely Broadwell came out. A pang shot through her heart as she espied his dwarfish figure. She had waited for him so long, what should she do now? What had she waited for? She had certainly no desire to speak or to be recognized by him. What had been her object in following him-in watching and waiting for him? 
                  She knew it not herself. No sooner did she see him emerge from the door than she turned about face and finding a side passage between two houses, hid herself in its further end. Meely passed by without observing her. A moment later she was once more on the street, following him. Ere she had gone any great distance, however, she stopped right short. The next moment saw her retrace her steps to the house Meely Broadwell had visited. 
                  She would find out what business had taken him there. Boldly she walked up to the door and knocked. A rough-looking woman admitted her; a woman in whom we recognize Mrs. Harder. 
                  "Whom do you want to see?" 
                  Ruth scarcely knew what to answer. In the spur of the moment she said: "The crazy woman." 
                  "You're too late." 
                  "Too late?" Ruth echoed. 
                  "Yes; she is dead." 
                  Ruth almost fainted; she was almost sinking to the floor. 
                  "Dead, you say?" 
                  "Yes, dead," replied Mrs. Harder, sulkily, returning to her work which consisted in cutting up some cloth which was spread out over the table. 
                  "Dead!" And Ruth relapsed into silence. Five minutes later she moved across the room, and gently laying hold of Mrs. Harder's hand, said to her: 
                  "When did she die?" 
                  "Last night." 
                  "Is she buried already?" 
                  "No; she won't be buried before evening." 
                  "May I see her corpse?" 
                  The woman turned sharply around upon her visitor, and scrutinized her with suspicion. 
                  "Why do you want to see her?" 
                  "Because I want to see her." 
                  Ruth said this softly, coaxingly, and placed at the same time, a five-dollar bill in Mrs. Harder's hand. This did the work effectually. It softened the heart at once. The linen cloth was dropped upon the table; the money carefully removed, and Ruth called upon to follow her. She was taken up two flights of stairs, and then hurried through a long, narrow passage. Here she was told to stop. It was in front of poor Rachel's cell. The woman opened the door, turned around, nodded to Ruth to come nearer, then pointed her finger toward something dark lying on a bundle of straw, and said: "Here, this is crazy Rachel!" 
                  Ruth looked down upon the bundle of straw and beheld the face of the dead. The blood in her own veins was congealed to ice before she even felt it congealing. She was paralyzed, transfixed, petrified. She stood there like a pillar of stone. Not a muscle moved in her face-not a breath escaped her lips. Her eyes were riveted on the lifeless form lying on that straw. 
                  "Will we go down now?" asked Mrs. Harder, after a short time. 
                  Ruth heard her voice grate upon her ears. She shrunk within herself as she awoke from her trance. 
                  "No, not yet," she replied, hoarsely, without removing her eyes from the face of the dead; "no, not yet. You may go down-I shall soon follow you." 
                  Mrs. Harder took the advice, and went down to her room. No sooner was she gone, than Ruth threw herself upon the corpse and shed a shower of tears. In the quiet, slumbering features, now locked in death, she had recognized the image of her mother-had recognized herself. Had the whole world come to her to say that that corpse, garbed in the commonest and filthiest of texture-had God himself descended from heaven and told her that it was not her mother, her mother who was still living in her soul-she would have called her own heart to witness, and stamped them, one and all, as base liars. Had she not seen that mother's picture-how many thousand times in her own room, where she had hung it up above her bed? And who could have looked upon that picture, and compared it with these features, though locked in death, and not have felt convinced? 
                  She threw her arms around that lifeless body, and by all endearing names, amid sobs and sighs, gave vent to the mightiest grief that ever shook and shattered a mortal frame.

                              Lays his rude hands upon her lovely limbs, 
                              And blasts her beauties with his icy breath. 
                           
                         
                        DENNIS'S APPIUS AND VIRGINIA. 
                      
                   
                  ON that day Thornton Mansion was pretty much deserted. Mr. Archibald Thornton and Meeley Broadwell had not come to dinner; Mrs. Thornton had sent word from the Wilhoytes' she wouldn't return before tea, and Ruth had only come back from her walk an hour before dark, when she locked herself in her room. The servants were somewhat astonished at this unusual proceeding, but said nothing. As it grew still darker Mr. Archibald Thornton and Meely Broadwell came home-and shortly after, the arrival of the hostess was announced. 
                  At supper the whole family was present, with the exception of Ruth. She had sent word down that she did not feel well enough to join them. As such a message from her was nothing unusual, it did not create the least surprise. Mr. Archibald seemed to be in the best of humor, so did Meely. They laughed and chatted-consider, Meely Broadwell laughed and chatted!-and were as happy and vivacious as two mischievous school-girls. Mrs. Lucretia Thornton was in a no less good humor than her husband and brother. A happy smile rested upon her lips, and a strange glow was on her temples. Her eyes were dancing in their sockets and shooting "love-glances"-an unusual thing-at her husband. He appreciated the kindness by a praiseworthy show of attention, and an extra kiss upon her soft brow after they had left the table. 
                  In the hall he parted from his wife and ascended the stairs. He wanted to see Ruth, and try to reconcile her to her fate. Meely Broadwell had deserved well of this sacrifice, and the promised reward should not be withheld. Arrived at the front of his daughter's room, Archibald Thornton gently knocked at the door, then, without waiting for a reply from within, crossed the still. 
                  Ruth was sitting before the grate, absent-mindedly looking at the flames as her father entered. She had heard his steps as he came nearer, and she turned her head partly toward him. He laid his hand upon her shoulder, and, while looking down upon her, said: 
                  "You have not been to supper, daughter. What's the matter with you? Are you sick?" 
                  "Yes, I am sick," she replied, with an indifference her father attributed to their last night's interview, then looked once more at the flames. 
                  "Do you want me to send for the physician?" and he took a seat by her side. 
                  "No." 
                  "I wanted to speak to you, Ruth," he continued, "in regard to Meely's proposition, but as you are not well enough this evening, we can defer it till morning." 
                  Ruth turned around and looked him full in the face. "You may say now," she commenced, "what you have to say. I am well enough to hear you. What do you want?" 
                  "Daughter, I want your consent-your free consent." 
                  "Consent to what?" 
                  "To Meely's flattering offer." 
                   
                  Ruth turned a little paler, once more looked into the fire, then said low and distinctly: 
                  "I'll not marry Meely Broadwell." 
                  "Not marry Meely Broadwell?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because I won't." 
                  "Not after you have promised it?" 
                  "No." 
                  "Ruth, do you know what you're saying?" 
                  "I do." 
                  "And do you know the consequences?" her father continued. 
                  "No, nor do I care to know them." 
                  Here a brief silence ensued. Ruth was still looking in the fire, and her father at her. 
                  "Do you know that your refusal will endanger my life, and threaten me with death?" 
                  "I don't know it, but if I did I should not marry Broadwell." 
                  "Ruth, consider," said her father, threatening. 
                  "I have nothing to consider. I shall never marry Meely Broadwell." 
                  He drew nearer to her, and took her ice-cold hands in his. 
                  "I call upon you," he pleaded softly, "in the name of your sainted mother--" 
                  She raised her face to his, compressed her lips, and fire flashed from her eyes, as she drew her hands from his polluting touch. 
                  "Don't call upon my sainted mother-will you?" she hissed, her cheeks turning as livid as the coals glowing in the hearth, and her whole frame shaking from suppressed emotion. "Don't call upon her, for fear God's wrath would light upon you and crush you." 
                  "Daughter, daughter, you frighten me with this incoherency," he answered. 
                  "Incoherency? Incoherency?" she echoed back to him. "I wish to God," and she lifted her eyes heavenward, "it were so, and I were mad." 
                  "Daughter!" 
                  She did not reply, but vaguely looked at the sporting flames. 
                  "My Ruth-my daughter." 
                  She turned upon him angrily and said: "Don't call me daughter any more." 
                  "Why?" 
                  She left the room without answering. When some fifteen minutes later she returned to it again it was deserted. Now she locked the door, threw herself upon her bed, and shed a shower of tears. In the mean time Mr. Archibald Thornton had gained his own room, where Meely Broadwell was waiting to hear the result of this conference. After repeating to him the substance of his conversation with his daughter, he begged Meely to abandon his suit, promising him not only a share in his very lucrative business, but half his own wealth, if that would satisfy him for the release of his claim on Ruth's hand. The temptation was great-Meely's cupidity was still greater, and the result was his abandonment of the suit. From that time forth Ruth was never more annoyed by his attention: but, grateful as she would have been for it before, it would not have troubled her now. The day that saw her mother buried, and on which occasion she was the only mourner present, saw a mighty change come over her. She grew reserved, and locked her grief within herself. She walked about the house more like a shadow than a living being, never receiving nor going into company. Weeks would pass before one of the family could extract a single word from her lips. Physicians, the best and profoundest, were called in, but all with no effect. She grew worse and worse, and, notwithstanding the grief that carved wrinkle after wrinkle on her father's brow, he could not get her to speak another word to him. His tears, his entreaties, all shows of affection, could not extract one syllable from her lips. Call me once more father," he pleaded to her upon his knees, while tears were in his eyes, "and I will die content." But the appeal was made in vain; Ruth never more spoke. 
                  Eighteen months after her mother's death her own end drew nigh. She lay in her bed, her large black eyes thoughtfully turned down upon her father's gray head. Her hand rested in his; he was gently stroking it. He had not left her sick couch for months. He had long since divined his daughter's grief, and remorse had made a prey of him. He knew that the knowledge of his crime-the great crime he had committed against her mother-was hurrying Ruth to the grave, and he wept bitter, scalding tears. As he now sat by her side, holding her hand, he fancied to feel it grow chill in his. He began to tremble, and his face exhibited a world of anxiety. Was she dying-his own loved Ruth dying? 
                  The invalid divined his thoughts, and smiled. He bowed over her and kissed her on her forehead. A moment later she lay a corpse in his arms. 
                  Good God! what tears he shed!

                              OUR time is set and fixed; our days are told; 
                              And no man knows the limit of his life; 
                              This minute may be mine, the next another's; 
                              But still all mortals ought to wait the summons, 
                              And not usurp on the decrees of fate, 
                              By hastening their own ends. 
                           
                         
                        SMITH'S PRINCESS OF PARMA. 
                      
                   
                  TIME rolled on, and over Rachel's and Ruth's graves the green, waving grass of two summers had sprouted and died away, and still Archibald Thornton mourned-still grieved. The man of flinty heart could not forget them. Rachel dead had more terrors for him than Rachel living. Her memory haunted him by day and by night-awake and asleep. It was a living torment to him-an ugly shadow, a hideous skeleton, that loomed up before his eyes, accusing him-O, in what a terrible way!-of treachery, neglect, desertion, cruelty and murder. Yes, murder. In his dreams he would see how he had mixed poison in the cup of coffee that he had reached her. For years he had prayed for her death, and now being dead, he would give-O, heavens! what would he not give!-all and every thing, could he but call her back to life once more. But what was done could not be undone, and his peace of mind was gone. Outwardly quiet, inwardly restless like a sleeping volcano, indifferent to every thing, forgetful of himself and all the world, with a mind in a morbid state, he had withdrawn himself from society to brood, solitarily, over his own sad and bitter reflections. But the world was no wiser for it. What is the misery of a single man in the scale of universal corruption and degeneracy? Who noticed it? Where was the gap his retiring made? Were there not thousands to take up the vacant space? And why then should he be missed? Why Rachel? Why Ruth? Have not millions upon millions played parts in this life's drama, and are forgotten now, as if they had never existed at all? The world goes on, and still will go on, long after we-the best of us-are dead, buried, and forgotten. 
                  No one asked into the cause of Rachel's death; no one into Ruth's. The wanderer who would look upon their tombstones and read the inscriptions thereon, would never dream that the cold clay beneath those little mounds, could it but rise and speak, would brand each word a damned lie. 
                  Mrs. Thornton, too, had of late grown sullen and thoughtful She remained at home much more than she had done before. She scarcely ever looked into her husband's face, and, whenever they met, a strange reserve was observable in her manners. For days, sometimes, she avoided him altogether. The servants began to whisper strange things about the house, but it never reached the ears either of Mr. or Mrs. Thornton. 
                  The cold weather set in; fire was once more kindled in the hearths, and the evenings began to be longer. It was on one of these evenings that Mrs. Thornton drew her chair to the fire and seated herself by the side of her husband. He was reading, or pretending to read. She waited a moment, looked at him thoughtfully, then softly twined her arms around his neck, and kissed him on his brow. He raised his eyes to her face, which was wreathed in smiles-a very picture of love, innocence, and amiability. 
                  "What do you want, Lucretia?" he said, tenderly, taking hold of one of her hands. 
                  "A kiss," she lisped, and drew nearer to him. 
                  A moment later, she embraced him again, and, as she did so, placed her lips close to his ear, and whispered: "Archie, you will be a father soon. I'm so happy;" and she kissed him again. 
                  He looked at her for the second time, then broke out into a loud laugh, rose to his feet, and exclaimed: 
                  "That's good, rich-decidedly rich. Then I'm to become a father yet in my old days. Wife"-here his voice changed, wrinkles furrowed his brow, and a wild, dangerous fire glistened in his eyes-"wife, come here!" he commanded. 
                  "What do you want?" 
                  "Come here." 
                  She hesitated a moment, then obeyed. 
                  "Look into my eyes?" he continued. "Look into them straight. Can you do it?" 
                  "Archie, dear Archie!" and she had recourse to tears. 
                  "Are you honest? Look up, I say. Are you honest?" 
                  "What do you mean?" 
                  "What I mean? What I mean?-Damn it, get out of my sight! Do you hear me?-get out of my sight!" 
                  "Archie-" 
                  "Get out of my sight!" 
                  "Ar-" 
                  "Get out of my sight!" 
                  "Listen-" 
                  He would not listen. As if stung by an adder, he jumped from his seat, and left the room he was never more to see alive. An hour later found him in his library. He was thoughtfully walking up and down the whole length of the floor. Twice he stopped before the table and examined and felt the woolen cloth that was spread over it. Then he looked about him as if in search of something. One after another-book-case, drawers, shelves-were searched, but evidently without success. At last he stopped in the center of the room, reflected for a moment, then left it hastily. In five minutes he was back, and in his hand he held a tolerably strong cord. This he laid on a chair, then began once more to walk up and down the room. Now he gave signs of restlessness, and frequently he would place his hand upon his brow. But it seemed to bring him little relief. 
                  He stopped before the chair and wanted to pick up the cord, but he moved away to the other side and turned off the gas. Fifteen minutes later a strange noise might have been heard in that room, something like a struggle of two wrestling mutes, then all was silent-silent as the grave. 
                  Archibald Thornton had launched himself into eternity. 
                  Lucretia Thornton had retired to rest, far from suspecting the terrible tragedy her husband had been enacting scarcely twenty paces from her bed-chamber. Yet a strange uneasiness pervaded her whole being and pressed down her heart. Repeatedly she closed her eyes and tried her very utmost to fall asleep-but she found the efforts useless, for sleep was banished from her mind. Where could Archibald keep himself so long? she thought. It struck nine, it struck ten, it struck eleven, and still that question did obtrude itself upon her mind. She raised herself up and listened. All was quiet; nothing save the ticking of the clock could be heard. She waited another half hour, then rose and dressed herself. This done, she took the candle, lighted it, and left the room. At the door of the library she stopped to listen; but all was as quiet within as the grave itself. Could he have fallen asleep? she thought, and she noiselessly turned the knob. She opened the door but half, and not discovering her husband any-where was about to turn back, when her eyes saw something dangling behind that door-she turned as white as snow, for a moment stood there as if petrified, then gave one wild piercing shriek, and dropped the candle on the floor. 
                  Meely Broadwell had not yet retired to rest. That piercing shriek had reached his ears, as he sat there, reading some late law-reports, before a comfortable coal-fire. 
                  Five minutes later he knew the truth. 
                  On the following morning the crape on the door of Thornton Mansion notified the passers-by of a death within. Meely Broadwell wrote out a very nice obituary and had it published in the city journals. How Mr. Archibald Thornton died was not, however, mentioned in it. That was a secret only known to his wife and her brother. 
                  In due time Mrs. Lucretia Thornton gave birth to a child. It was a beautiful child-black-eyed, black-haired, and fair-skinned. It hadn't a feature of its mother, it hadn't a feature of Mr. Archibald Thornton in its face, and still the world suspected nothing. Mrs. Thornton was rich and a lady who moved in the highest circles of society, and the voice of slander was never raised against her. Though her husband had been rather old-what of that? How many old men-men older than Thornton had been-have had additions to their families in the shape of children, and no one thought of questioning their parentage? Why should we stop now and make an example of this case? 
                  The world went on as usual. The birth of this little girl and the death of Mr. Thornton were forgotten; Mrs. Thornton mixed once more in society, and Meely Broadwell was still leading a bachelor life. Clermont Harland was still in San Francisco. He had given up all idea of returning to Cincinnati; for he had heard, shortly after his arrival in California, of Hannah's marriage with Clarence Broadwell, whom he still fancied in a prosperous condition, for the Thornton family had not heard any thing from him for some time. 
                  One day, however, a Cincinnati journal reached his hand. It contained the account of Lionel Harrington's murder, and Hannah's arrest. That very evening he took the steamer for New York. Two months later he arrived in the city of his childhood.

                              There's not a pulse that throbs not, when I hear 
                              Thy voice, thy breathing, nay, thy very name. 
                           
                         
                        FRANCES KEMBLE BUTLER. 
                      
                   
                  DURING the eight years that Clermont Harland had been gone from his home, his appearance, he knew, had sufficiently changed to prevent his most intimate friends and acquaintances from recognizing him. Consequently, when he, on the morning after his arrival, sent in his card, and finally presented himself to his old friend Mr. Montgomery, his identity was never suspected. 
                  "I have taken the liberty to call on you," Clermont said, after he had been invited to a seat, "in order to gain of you some information in regard to a certain family with some members of which, if I have been rightly informed, you are somewhat acquainted. I should not have been so bold," he continued, "had I not been assured of your obliging disposition." 
                  "Any information I can give you, sir," Mr. Montgomery replied, "as a matter of course you shall have with the greatest of pleasure. What is it you wish to know, sir?" 
                  "I should be pleased to know something in regard to the fate of Mr. Clarence Broadwell and his family." 
                  Mr. Montgomery half rose from his chair, and staring the stranger full in the face, said, in a far louder tone than was necessary: "Sir, I trust you have not come here to insult me? I have nothing whatever to do with those people; and for any one to couple my name with theirs, is to me provokingly unpleasant, to say the least of it. I can not give you any information about those people; you have certainly been wrongly directed. Good morning, sir." So saying, he rose with an offended air, and made a step or two in the direction of the door. 
                  The hint was broad enough for any one to understand. Clermont Harland also rose from his chair, picked up his hat, and said: "Mr. Montgomery, I beg to be excused if I have given offense by this question. I am a stranger in this city-" 
                  "Very well, sir," the other interrupted; "I thank no one for recommending you to me for information about such people. If you go to the police-court, I have no doubt your curiosity can be satisfied there. Good morning." 
                  Mr. Montgomery turned around, sat down once more, then picked up something in the shape of a newspaper. Clermont Harland looked at him for a moment, heaved a sigh, then bowed himself out of the room. At that moment he thought of Joseph Joseph and the opinion he had had of mankind. 
                  He made his way to the police-court; it was just in session, so he took a seat among the spectators and thought of waiting until he could have speech with some of the prominent officials. The court did not adjourn until late in the afternoon. When the judge rose he rose also, and followed him to the door. He knew it would not do to address him there upon that topic, so he only asked him at what time in the evening he could have the honor of speaking to him. The judge informed him that he could be seen at his office between the hours of four and five. 
                  Clermont Harland was punctual. It had just struck four when he entered his honor's office. It was near six when he left it. He looked sad and depressed, and his head was lowered to the ground. The judge had told him the whole case as it had been tried before him; told him, too, that Mrs. Broadwell had broken her bail, and disappeared from Cincinnati, no doubt, to follow her husband, of whose guilt there wasn't a shadow of doubt, to his place of concealment. 
                  He returned to his hotel unhappier than he had been for years. Hannah-his own Hannah-suspected and accused of the greatest crime. Of murder! His heart almost broke within his bosom. He could have shed a shower of tears had not his grief been too deep for such a manifestation of relief. How he accused and tortured himself for ever having left her! There was no longer any rest for him on earth. The angel of vengeance seemed pointing his finger at him, accusing him of being the cause of all the misery that had befallen, and still might befall, his once dearly-loved wife. And what of his own son-his dear little Emil? 
                  He stopped thinking; it would have crazed him to follow any longer that train of thought. He returned to his hotel, took a light supper, then sauntered out once more. His honor the judge had told him that a certain Mr. Reuben Armhold had bailed out, and subsequently paid the forfeit, of Hannah's release. He would find out his brother's whereabouts if he could. Information could be gained from that source he was certain. 
                  Had Clermont Harland found that brother-how much he could have heard! How much of Hannah's life with all its wretchedness might have been made clear to him! But Reuben Armhold was not to be found. He had left the city some weeks before in company with Miss Carrie Harrington. 
                  Reuben Armhold in company with Miss Carrie Harrington! Low as she had fallen, in his opinion, she was a peeress in comparison with Nellie Montgomery. 'Tis true she had sacrificed her honor upon the shrine of love and passion, but she had never encouraged a love, then heartlessly closed her heart against it. Yes, they had gone off together, both of them recklessly indifferent to their future and reputation, satisfied with the pleasures of the present, though it carried within them the germ of final ruin. They had nothing more to lose; ambition and honor were dead in both, and they rushed headlong into that world of vice, dissipation and corruption, in which they were soon engulfed and lost, never more to breathe the pure air of virtue and redemption. 
                  It was the last ever heard of them. 
                  Clermont Harland still remained several days in Cincinnati, during which time he went to such localities and visited such places where he was more successful in gaining information of his wife's bitter trials since he had left her. But no one could tell him what had become of her. That seemed to be a mystery to one and all alike. She and her children had at once disappeared. The wretched room they had inhabited was one morning found vacated, but even the people who had resided with them in the same house could not satisfactorily account for their disappearance. 
                  Still Clermont Harland had some hopes of finding them. Month after month stole over his head, and the winter's snow melted with April's sun, and the April sun grew hotter and hotter, until September blasts chilled and stole away from it its warmth, when he gave up all hopes he had of finding them here and left for parts unknown. Now he visited city after city, in some remaining longer than in others, but nowhere could he obtain a clue of his missing dears. Thus passed year after year and Clermont Harland, tired of this roaming life, finally gave up all search, and settled down in the city of New York. He was an old man now, and his own raven-locks had long since grown gray. There was no longer any elasticity in his steps, no longer any fire in his now sunken eyes. He had, owing to his continually increasing feebleness, to support himself, when walking, on a cane. But he scarcely ever went from the room in which he had made up his mind to die. Though rich and able to obtain for himself all imaginable comforts he preferred to live without the least ostentation. A small room, containing a bed, book-case, table and few chairs, made up his whole household. He had no servants and wanted none. A girl who lived in the same dwelling, and acted as house-maid to the family on the first floor, came regularly every morning to make his room in order. His meals he took at a restaurant. None knew, and no one cared to know, who he was. The people in the house looked upon him as an eccentric, miserly, old man, who, in all probability, was living on some rich relative's charity-some relative who cheerfully paid this tribute to helpless age, as long as that helpless age was content to keep its wrinkled face away from the mirror in which youth does love to see itself. 
                   
                  Clermont Harland cared not what opinion this or that person might entertain of him. He was calmly waiting for that day when he should be gathered to his fathers. His principal time was spent in seeking out the poor and afflicted in order to give them the relief it was in his power to give. While thus one evening on one of these missions of mercy, he had to pass a low grog-shop. In front of the shanty he saw a woman standing, anxiously looking through the door. Just as he was about to pass by, she turned her face to his, and begged him to be so kind as to call that man-she did not call him gentleman-who stood in front of the bar with a glass of whisky in his hand, out upon the street. But Clermont Harland could not do the bidding. He trembled from head to foot, and his frail, then and bent-up frame seemed to break asunder. The cane could scarcely support him any longer. His eyes were full of tears, and he felt like crying-crying out like a little child. 
                  He knew that voice, though it was harsh, shattered and broken now-would have known it among a million as that of his Hannah-the wife he had deserted, so many, many years ago. Now he raised his eyes to her face that wore the marks of unutterable misery. It was as pale as that of the sickly moon that hung over them, the sallow wrinkled skin scarcely covering the bones-the skeleton bones of those once beautiful cheeks. Her form was not bowed down like that of Clermont, but in its stiffness reminded him of some dead stalk that would snap asunder in its dryness if it were but slightly touched. She was poorly clad, and the cold wind played maliciously with her ragged raiments. 
                  Clermont Harland took all this in at a single glance, and while his heart wept tears of pity, a voice within him whispered: "Thou hast not lived in vain." 
                  "What man," he asked, hastily, "do you wish me to call out?" 
                  "That old man standing in front of the bar, with a glass in his hand," she replied, laying her cold, bony hand on his lean, lank arm. "He is my husband." 
                  Clermont Harland said nothing in return. He simply leaned a little heavier on his walking-stick, then entered the bar-room. The old man whom he was to call out upon the street was just raising the glass to his lips. Clermont Harland gently laid his hand upon the other's uplifted arm, and said to him, in a low, feelingful voice: "Put down this glass, my dear friend, and let me speak to you a few words." 
                  Clarence Broadwell-for it was he-turned his face toward him, and slowly returned the still untasted liquor upon the counter. As he did so, he scrutinized the new-comer from head to foot. At last-the scrutiny over-he gave vent to a half-suppressed laugh, muttered something to himself, then was about to lift the glass once more to his lips. Clermont saw it, and for the second time laid his hand upon the half-raised arm. This time Clarence Broadwell did not take this interference with the same grace and indifference. No, indeed. He got angry, and his sunken gray eyes grew bright and restless in their dark caves, and his head and arm, which had shook nervously before, began at once to increase in unsteadiness, so much so, indeed, that he spilled the whole contents of the glass upon the counter. Now he commenced to growl, and wanted to know why he was insulted by that d-d curse of an old fool. 
                  Clermont Harland saw in an instant that Broadwell was drunk; he therefore shaped his conduct accordingly. He could also see that he must have been sick, for the color of his face, the peculiar transparency of the skin and finger-nails, his bluish lips-in fact, his whole appearance was that of a person who had recently risen from a sick couch. "I have some money to give you," Clermont said, just loud enough to reach his ears; "yes, I have some money to give you, and I want you to go with me at once to your home." 
                  He passed his hand through the other's arm, and led him toward the door. Here Broadwell stopped, and said: "Suppose you take a drink with me before we go?" 
                  "No," replied Clermont; "we have no time to drink now. I am in a hurry, and your wife is also waiting for you." 
                  As he said this, Clarence Broadwell looked around and stopped right short. He wouldn't move another step. "Ain't you lying to me now?" he said. "You haven't got any money for me, no-you are just lying, and want to get me home. But you can't do it. I am going to stay here just as long as I please. Do you hear that? If you don't make yourself scarce I'll blacken your eyes for you." 
                  He pushed Clermont Harland from his side, and retraced his steps to the bar, once more calling for a glass of whisky. Just then the door opened, and Hannah, nothing abashed, walked up to the counter, took Broadwell by the arm, and forcibly led him from this den of vice. His efforts to resist were useless. She proved the stronger of the two, and, amid the rough jibes and jeers of an inebriated crew, they disappeared in the street. Clermont followed them at a little distance. He could see with what great difficulty Hannah succeeded in pulling her drunken husband along with her. He could also hear how Clarence cursed and threatened to kill her when she got home, to all of which she had not a word to reply. She was still as a mute. She listened to his oaths, threats and curses, and pushed ahead as if not a syllable had been addressed to her. Finally they reached a long, narrow alley. No gas-lamp threw a ray of light into it. It was pitch dark from one end of it to the other. Into that uninviting alley they passed; into that uninviting alley Clermont Harland followed them. He had hard work not to lose sight of them. Men and women, like restless goblins, flitted mysteriously now here, now there, now one way and then another. Still he persisted in his journey. Now he reached the middle of the alley. He could hear Broadwell's voice still in front of him. Hannah had not yet uttered a word; she was still as silent as the grave; still leading her husband forcibly along. 
                  Just then a small door opened, and a ray of light fell upon the pavement. It was a lucky thing for Clermont Harland, for without the aid of that momentary flash he would have lost sight of them. They were just turning down into another alley that was narrower, darker and dirtier than the one through which they had passed-Broadwell still cursing, Hannah still silent. At last they stopped in front of a small, dilapidated, dingy-looking, old frame-shanty. Clermont Harland saw the door open and close behind them. Noiselessly he stationed himself in front of the window. He listened for a moment to the noise within. He could not be mistaken: they were wrangling and scuffling, and Hannah-his own Hannah-was crying. God! how his heart smote him! He moved up to the door, and, as he wanted to knock for admittance, it flew open by itself. A drearier, sadder aspect could not have been seen. A dark, low-ceiled room, with but one window, opened to his view. A straw mattress was lying on the floor, three chairs, a broken stove, and an old table, were the extent of its contents. A big tub was standing on one of those chairs, with linens and other cloths. On the stove a large kettle was steaming with hot water. Hannah, in her old age, had to support herself by taking in washing. 
                  Clermont Harland neither saw the mattress, chairs, stove, table, tub of linens, nor the kettle with the steaming water. He saw only one thing. He saw Hannah lying on the floor, while Broadwell was beating her. For a moment he fancied the strength of his youth returning to him. He dropped the cane by his side, and hastened to his Hannah's rescue. Unfortunately he was just a moment too late to avert a disastrous blow that had been successfully directed at her face. At once he threw himself between her and her brutal antagonist, and separated them. Broadwell was too exasperated to know or care who was interfering. It was not the first time that strangers had come into this room to witness the row between him and his wife. Such things were not unusual. All he did now was a little more cursing and swearing, then he rose and-fell down. This frenzy had totally exhausted him, and his feet would not carry him. 
                  The fall was heavy, very heavy, for he didn't move, and he lay there as if the last breath had departed from him. Hannah, being upon her feet once more, looked down upon him for a moment, then called him by his name. He did not reply. She began to tremble from head to foot, and called once more. Again no answer. Now she began to sob aloud, and the tears that rushed from her eyes mingled with the blood his blows had brought to her cheeks. She knelt down by his side, and, while she called him by all endearing names, placed her fingers upon his pulse. "It beats! he lives-he lives!" she shrieked, then hastily rose to her feet, got a wet rag, and passed it over his temples. Broadwell opened his eyes, then closed them once more, as if in death. With the assistance of Clermont Harland, he was removed to the mattress, where he eventually fell into a heavy sleep. 
                  Up to this moment scarcely a word had passed between Hannah and her strange visitor; and even now the poor old woman simply threw herself upon one of those old rickety chairs, and began to cry. Clermont was standing but a short distance from her, and watched her narrowly. He knew not-he felt not-how tired he himself was. His whole mind was taken up with that sad spectacle before him. Hannah, his own dear Hannah, suffering to such an extent! He looked at her, and he felt like falling upon his knees and pressing the sad relic of that once beautiful form to his bosom. He saw the bloody mark upon her cheek, and tears came to his own eyes. He would wipe that blood away-yes, he would wipe it away. 
                  He made a step forward, and-poor old man!-his strength forsook him, and he fell upon his knees. Hannah, who was still crying, was under the impression that he had simply lowered himself, in order to pick up his walking-stick, and therefore did not notice the tears that noiselessly fell from the frail wreck of her first and only love. Eventually he rose, and that sad, pale face wore an expression of heavenly peace and beatitude. He felt a little stronger, and he walked, now leaning on his cane, toward the still weeping and bitterly suffering woman. 
                  "I am going away," he said, "and I want your permission to call on you to-morrow morning. I see you are in trouble, and if you will but suffer me to help you, I shall be happy to ameliorate your condition." 
                  She did not answer him in words, but threw herself upon her knees, and while she hid her face in her thin, fleshless hands, sobbed aloud: "O God! O God! don't talk to me that kindly. I have not heard such words since Edgar left me!" 
                  They wept-Hannah upon her knees, and Clermont bending over her. Five long minutes elapsed, and not a syllable passed between them. He had scarcely sufficient control over himself to keep from falling around her neck, ask her to forgive him, and call her once more his own dear wife. 
                  A heavy, long-drawn sigh, coming from the opposite corner of the room, caused Hannah to rise to her feet and direct her steps toward the straw mattress upon which Clarence Broadwell now lay awake. His eyes were wide open, but there was something strangely vague and uncertain in them, and Clermont Harland, who had followed Hannah to the sick-couch, saw in an instant that a high fever had set in. 
                  "Your husband is not quite well," he said. "Don't you think it would be better to send for a physician?" 
                  Hannah did not answer. She simply looked down-with the big tears still hanging in her eyes-upon Broadwell; upon the man who had been the destroyer of his as well as of her own happiness. Did she hate him now for all the misery he had occasioned her? Did she curse him for it? No! That bony, frail frame, with just enough life to make it conscious of its rapid decay, as it lay there, infused her with pity for the helpless, child-deserted, world-spurned wretch, and showed her with what speed we are leaving behind us youth, beauty, and even the passions, that, like clouds slashed and driven by a mighty gale, have stormed the citadel of Reason, and scattered peace and hope far and wide for evermore. 
                  "Don't you think it would be better to send for a physician?" 
                  She looked up as these words were addressed to her for the second time. She met the stranger's eye for a moment, then replied, "No; thank you." 
                  Clermont Harland could see she was struggling to appear calm-that the pride of the Prestons was still not entirely quenched. 
                  "Who is your physician?" 
                  "We have none particularly engaged." 
                  "Your husband was sick?" 
                  "Yes, sir; he had the bilious fever, and only rose from his bed last week, after a sickness of six weeks' duration." 
                  "Have you children, ma'am?" 
                  She appeared not to notice the question, and only after it was repeated for the second time, she answered, rather huskily: "We have five children." 
                  "Are they living?" 
                  "I suppose so." 
                  "Why, don't you know where they are?" he asked. 
                  "No, sir." She covered her face with her apron, and cried. The poor old woman had, like thousands of other mothers, been deserted in her need by her children, for whom she had suffered worse than starvation. 
                  "Have you any children dead?" he continued, after a short pause. 
                  "Yes, sir, a boy. O, if my little Emil had lived, I should not have to suffer so now." 
                  Here the poor old woman broke down. She sat down upon the floor-upon the cold, hard floor-and gave vent to her pent-up emotions. What did she care for that stranger? She was forsaken by God and the world, and she emptied her heart in a shower of tears. 
                  Clermont Harland was also weeping, but she did not see it, for he had turned his face away from her. Now, having partly regained his self-composure, he approached her and said: "I am going now, and, if you will let me, I shall come back to-morrow morning to see how your husband is." 
                  He didn't wait for a reply, but went out. He supported himself on his cane, and slowly groped his way through the dark. It took him considerable time to reach the end of that gloomy alley. He took a long breath and walked down the street. Here he met the young and happy, laughing and chattering, while he just left one who had at one time been as happy as they. Who could tell what was in store for them? 
                  Suddenly he stopped, and muttered some few words before him, then retraced his steps back through the same street, and back through the same alley, stopping once more in front of that dilapidated shanty and knocked at its door. It flew open again as it had done the first time, for the latch was out of repair. He espied Hannah kneeling upon the floor, before the straw mattress, applying a wet cloth upon Broadwell's feverish temples. Clermont walked gently up to her; she heard his steps and turned around, looking inquiringly into his face. 
                  "I have come back," he said in a half whisper, "to beg you for something." 
                  "For what?" 
                  "You are a washerwoman?" 
                  "Yes." 
                  "And you want to wash these clothes tonight?" 
                  "Yes, sir." She could scarcely say the words. "But I can't wash more than these to-night. Please don't ask me, sir. I am too weak. I will wash yours to-morrow if you say so, but not to-night-no, not tonight." 
                  "It is not that what I want of you," he replied, scarcely able to repress his tears. "No, good woman, I have another favor to ask of you." 
                  "What is it?" 
                  "I want you to leave these clothes untouched until you see me again to-morrow." 
                  "Why?" 
                  "Because I want you to rest to-night." 
                  "I can't do it, sir, for we're poor and need the money." 
                  He took out a purse-but put it back again into his pocket. He could not offend her by giving her money in that way. He remembered with what delicacy, when he was a little boy, and she a little girl, she had dropped a gold coin into his bundle of goods. 
                  "You shall not be suffering on that account count," he said. "Promise me faithfully, ma'am, to leave this washing untouched until morning-until you see me again, and I shall in the meantime study how to better your condition." 
                  The promise was given, and Clermont Harland took his leave for the second time, but not till Hannah had given him the name of the alley and the number of the house in which she resided. 
                  This information obtained, he departed. An hour later a wagon with wine and provisions stopped in front of Hannah's house. "They were for Mr. Broadwell," the driver said, and carried them in the room. After he was gone, Hannah for some time looked down upon the treasure-for to her it was a treasure-then threw herself upon her knees, and lifting her shrunken arms heavenward, sobbed: "God, O my good God! forgive me! You are all too merciful." 
                  In the mean time Clermont Harland had gained his own house, and was now seated before a bright fire in his little room, peacefully watching the smoke-cloudlets as they sailed from his pipe around his silver-gray head. 
                
                
                  CHAPTER X. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              THAT man lives greatly, 
                              Whate'er his fate, or fame, who greatly dies; 
                              High flushed with hope, where heroes shall despair. 
                           
                         
                        YOUNG'S NIGHT THOUGHTS. 
                      
                   
                  EARLY on the following morning Clermont Harland, accompanied by a physician, knocked for admittance at the shanty in the alley. They were received by Hannah, in whose careworn face they could perceive traces of tears. She spoke to them a few words of welcome; then, while the physician was walking across the small room toward the mattress upon which Broadwell lay, she raised her eyes to the calm, peaceful face of Clermont Harland, and added: 
                  "What have I, a poor, old and wretched woman, done to deserve such kindness at your hands?" 
                  She wanted to say more, but somehow the words stuck fast in her throat, her eyes filled with tears, and the poor woman raised her apron to her face to conceal her bitter emotions. As she did so, Clermont's glance fell upon her hands, and with a painful sensation he perceived how those beautiful, soft white hands had lost their dimpled roundness, and now were simply bone and wrinkled skin, beneath which her ebbing life-blood coursed through the swelled and bluish veins. The wedding-ring he had given her-that plain gold ring that was to have been the pledge of everlasting faith, love, truth, and fidelity-was still upon the finger upon which he had placed it so many, many years ago, but none of Broadwell's graced that wrinkled hand. What! had he not given her any pledge? 
                  His thoughts and speculations were at once interrupted by the return of the physician to his and Hannah's side. 
                  "Your husband," said the man of medicine, "has a high fever, and needs careful attention. Can you tell me, good woman,"-here Clermont informed her of the gentleman's profession-that he was a physician he had brought here to attend to Mr. Broadwell-"can you tell me, good woman, how long your husband has been sick, and what you have already done for him?" 
                  Here Hannah told the doctor, with a reticence and a reserve, in regard to Clarence Broadwell's dissolute life, so natural to a good wife, sufficient of his ways and of his late illness to enable him to give a better judgment about the invalid's disease and its treatment. After he had listened to her recital, he advised her to be of good cheer, for he would do his utmost to bring about a speedy recovery. He wrote out a prescription, gave some few other directions, then left, after promising to call again sometime later in the day. 
                  While Hannah was following him to the door, Clermont advanced to the sick man's couch on the floor. Broadwell was not asleep; his eyes were wide open, and their glance was vague and meaningless. His dry and parched lips moved incessantly, incoherently articulating words. Clermont saw at first sight that the patient was delirious, and, by all appearances, in a poorer state of health and in a more dangerous condition, than the physician was willing to acknowledge. 
                  While thus meditating and thoughtfully gazing upon the wreck of the man who had once shone forth in all brilliancy-upon the man who, to the greatest extent, had been the cause of his first estrangement with his wife-upon the man who had embittered his life, that would have been so sweet but for his shadow coming between it-and saw him now laid low, scarcely a step from the grave, deserted by his former friends, deserted by his children; an outcast even of the outcasts-none to cling to him in the sear of his life save one, and that one the only person who had suffered most at his hands, whose hopes he had all destroyed, whose whole career he had embittered with all the ills an evil genius could invent, whose fair name he had compromised, dishonored, and disgraced, who had hungered and thirsted for him, who had calmly taken his threats and curses; yes, while thus meditating over this, Clermont did not hear the approach of Hannah; and only after she had thrown herself upon her knees behind him, and her tears fell upon the skirt of his garment which the poor woman was repeatedly raising to her lips, he turned around, and, scarcely master over his own feelings, told her, in a voice full of emotion, to rise from this position, and dispense with such manifestations of thankfulness. But that was all he said. He, too, had suffered a great deal, and felt more like weeping-felt more like having a good, hearty cry-than like speaking. 
                  Hannah did not thank him in words. She looked upon that old man as an angel who must, by some means or other, have discovered the secret sufferings of her own heart. 
                  She rose to her feet, wiped her eyes dry, then approached Clarence's couch. 
                  "There will be two bedsteads brought here," Clermont said, "and other trifles, which I have ordered for you this morning. Your husband needs close attention, and I want you to suffer me-mark me, Mrs. Broadwell. I have nothing else in the whole wide world to do-to watch over him until he feels strong enough once more to do without both your and my assistance." 
                  "Good God!-O, good, good, good God!" she exclaimed, lifting her bony arms heavenward, "what am I to say to your mercy?" Then turning around, and looking Clermont fully in the face, and for a moment watching its expression, said: "Who are you, sir-you, who take so great an interest in this poor, old woman, for whom nobody cares?" 
                  What a temptation! Why should he conceal the fact from her any longer? Why not tell her that he is her own dear Edgar? Why not unload his own soul and be happy once more? Broadwell was sick, very sick-would die in all probability-and--a pang shot through his heart! 
                  He would do no such thing. "LOVE is the greatest virtue, and FORBEARANCE the sublimest courage," was Joseph Joseph's apothegm, and it was also his. He thought over it for a moment; a sad, peaceful smile-scarcely perceptible-came over his calm features, and he said, disclaiming all credit and thanks: 
                  "Good woman, you ask me who I am, and, to satisfy you, I will tell you that the little I am about doing for yourself and husband is a duty a certain society imposes upon me to perform in my official capacity. So, you see, you need not thank me for any thing. The thanks are rather due to that universal love of man, though it has become strangely perverted, but still is the first principle of our brotherhood. Therefore, from this time forth, whatever shall be done for you by me toward the amelioration of your condition, you must never forget for a moment that I am simply carrying out instructions from a higher authority." 
                  From this time forth Hannah never knew any better but what that benevolent old man, Clermont Harland, was simply an agent, as he himself had stated, to carry out instructions received from a higher tribunal. In this capacity he was received now, day after day, by his former wife, who lived by his generosity without knowing it. 
                  Clarence Broadwell, for nearly two weeks, lay in a state of unconsciousness, now and then speaking deliriously, but in a voice that was so faint and weak, that it scarcely rose, at any time, above a whisper. The physician came regularly, and Clermont Harland passed the most of his time at the invalid's couch. At last, one morning, Clarence opened his eyes, and wildy stared at his wife, and then at Harland. 
                  "Where am I?" he whispered. 
                  "You are at home, Clarence," she said. "You have been ill, but you are better now, thank God, and growing stronger." 
                  Broadwell did not hear half of what Hannah said. His eyes were once more closed, and he was dozing again. 
                  From this time forth he was recovering slowly. Clermont came day after day, and between these two old men, so different in disposition, a friendship grew up that was as fervent as it was unselfish. Thus Clarence, after listening to Harland's gentle words and voice, would speak of his own past sins, and, with tears in his eyes, repent of the great wrongs he had inflicted upon his wife-upon all who had suffered through him. Hannah, too, would listen, with tears in her eyes, as the past, with all its horrors, was again called up to her memory, but scarcely ever would she participate in the conversation. Her heart was sealed, and the wrongs she had suffered were never more to pass her lips. Only once, yes once, when Clarence spoke of Reuben Armhold's magnanimity in releasing and suffering him to escape from the arms of justice, she exclaimed: "Mr. Harland, do you think that God can forgive the sins both Clarence and myself have committed? As I look back over our career, I see more horrid spots on the record of the past than all the tears we might shed from now until God should gather us home can wipe away." 
                  Clermont Harland smiled-smiled as one whose every thought was of love-and, as he joined the hands of Hannah and Clarence, said in a voice that, in its calmness, conveyed a sweetness, fervency and holiness: 
                  "Friends, as you forgive yourselves, God will forgive you. Be good and loving in the future, and let your last days be spent in peace and happiness. Do not reprove one another, but let the gone-by slumber in the tomb of forgetfulness, and, like myself, express with Shakspeare: 
                         
                           "'Life's but a walking shadow; a poor player, 
                           That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, 
                           And then is heard no more: it is a tale 
                           Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, 
                           Signifying nothing.'" 
                        
                     
                   
                  Thus day by day passed by, when, on one occasion, Clermont Harland informed Clarence and Hannah that they would have to leave the shanty in the alley, and accept his invitation to spend the balance of their days in his own house. He told them that his own life without them would be incomplete, and his happiness depended upon their accepting his proposition. 
                  They did not refuse-they could not refuse. The invitation was tendered more like asking a favor than offering one. In less than a week from that time Clarence Broadwell and Hannah found themselves introduced in a splendid mansion, furnished richly, to which Clermont Harland bade them welcome as their future home. There were servants to wait on them and do their every bidding. 
                  This was morning; on the evening of the same day, a little after supper, Clermont Harland informed Clarence and Hannah that he would have to leave them on business of importance, and, in all probability, would not return for some days. "I have made," he added, "arrangements in the bank, that you can draw whatever money you may need during my absence." 
                  After some little more conversation he took his final leave. No one saw the tears that stood in his eyes as he left the house, and walked down the street. 
                  He went right straight to his own room-the room he had occupied for years-the room in which we have first found him. Arrived there, he seated himself in the armchair, and till far in the night he was pensively watching the flames in the hearth. At last he rose, went to a little bureau, and brought out his diary to which he had confided the events of his whole life. He looked over it for some time, then picked up the pen and added: 
                  "I have seen Hannah to-day for the last time. Clarence Broadwell is reclaimed, and I have provided for all their future wants; I can die in peace now." 
                
                
                  CHAPTER XI. 
                   
                      
                        
                            
                              EVEN such is time, that takes on trust 
                              Our youth, our joys, our all we have, 
                              And pays us but with age and dust, 
                              Who in the dark and silent grave, 
                              When we have wandered all our ways, 
                              Shuts up the story of our days! 
                              But from this earth, this grave, this dust, 
                              My God shall raise me up, I trust! 
                           
                         
                        SIR WALTER RALEIGH. 
                      
                   
                  DAYS, weeks, and months passed, and still not a word could be heard of Clermont Harland's whereabouts. His unaccountable silence created considerable apprehension and uneasiness in the minds of the two old beings he had snatched from the arms of vice, penury and crime, and raised to a state of independence, ease and luxury. What had become of him was a problem about which they often spoke and studied, and then dismissing it again with little hope of ever solving it. The first few weeks after his absence they had labored under the impression that some important business might have detained him from returning as soon as he had expected. But, then, why not write and ease their minds? It was a total mystery-a mystery they could not unravel. As days waxed into weeks, and weeks into months, and still nothing could be heard of him, their uneasiness about his safety increased. Could he have been foully dealt with? They knew that he was rich-very rich. Broadwell had been told so by the banker upon whom he was permitted to draw for any amount. Might he not, on the day of his departure, or on any subsequent day, have had a considerable amount of ready money about his person, and have been murdered? For some time Clarence and Hannah had feared that Clermont had come to an untimely end. But if such had been the case, what had become of his body? Why had he not been missed by anybody? Was it likely that a man of Clermont's means, and who represented, as he had informed them, in an official capacity, a society-an organization of no little pretensions-could simply disappear without an effort of some one to solve the mystery? It was hardly possible. Had he been foully dealt with, it would have created some stir, either here, there, or elsewhere. Hence Mr. and Mrs. Broadwell abandoned this idea, and inclined to the belief that their old friend and protector had died a natural death, and was buried, in all probability, with as little noise and ostentation as they had found him to crave and be fond of since they had first become acquainted with him. 
                  It was now a year-a long twelve-month-since Clermont Harland had left them, and the subject of his strange disappearance was once more discussed by Mr. and Mrs. Broadwell as they sat, one cold evening, before a good, comfortable coal-fire, in the home that had so strangely been provided for them. They were happy now, and, with chastened spirits, after a life of such bitter and sad recollections, thanked-from their very hearts thanked-the being who had so unselfishly saved them from vice, saved them from penury, saved them from starvation-saved them, above all, from themselves and from their reproaches, taught them to look into their souls; the being who reclaimed them and infused into them a spirit of peace and rest. 
                  "Hannah," said Broadwell, turning his wrinkled but thoughtful face toward his wife, "I have been to see Mr. Morton," (Mr. Morton was the banker with whom Clermont Harland had deposited his money) "in regard to our continually drawing on him for money." 
                  "What did he say?" inquired Hannah, in return. 
                  "Well, Mr. Morton smiled when I expressed to him my delicacy in continuing to draw on him for funds in the name of Mr. Clermont Harland. Yes, he smiled, Hannah, then told me that his instructions were plain and to the point. I sat down when he said this, for I wanted to hear all he had to say. And what do you think he did say, Hannah?" 
                   
                  Hannah, as a matter of course, couldn't guess. 
                  "Well, he told me his instructions were to honor my checks-mark me, my checks, as long as he would those of Clermont Harland, whose funds, to the amount of over one hundred thousand dollars, were in his bank, and any monies thus drawn by me to be charged to him. I told Mr. Morton then, that it is more than strange that nothing could be heard of our benefactor's disappearance, to which remark he simply expressed a slight feeling of surprise, and said that Mr. Harland would sooner or later turn up somewhere and give an account of himself. In the mean time I should, according to instruction, without the least reserve, draw on him for any funds I might want." 
                  And thus encouraged, Clarence Broadwell continued to live on the bounty of his absent benefactor. In the mean time Clermont Harland, feeling his end draw nigh, and having done all he could toward insuring the happiness of the woman he had so ardently loved, made preparations for that day in which he should be called home to his fathers. His health had been gradually failing him, his constitution had been growing feebler for some time, a cough that on several occasions had almost left him without a breath had set in, and now confined him to his room. In consequence of which he had added a servant to his household whose duty it was to attend to his wants. For hours he would sit now in his arm-chair thinking over the past-a past that had been fraught with so much bitterness-and ponder over the events that had made his long, long life a scene of struggles, from which he could take a final leave without a feeling of regret. He had no longer any desire to live; his race was run. He belonged to another generation-to a generation that had long since died out. His mission was fulfilled; others had been born to take up his place, and again others will be born to take up theirs. He would not be missed. Old, worn out and sickly, what else was left for him to do but to make peace with his own soul and die? 
                  His eyes had been growing dim, and the pleasure of reading was almost denied to him, and yet, an hour or so each day, he read and wrote. Day after day he added something to his diary, making it as complete an autobiography as his skill and memory could render it. The love that he had always felt for his Hannah-his own dear wife-was a thousand times dwelt upon with a religious fervency that bordered on sacred devotion. Yes, when he should be dead, this unvarnished tale of his life, of his acts, of his unexpressed feelings, should be handed to his Hannah, so she might bless his memory when he was here no longer to receive her pardon. Yes, she should know, when he is dead, that he had ever loved her, and that he had only parted from her impressed with the hope that his absence would make her happier. It had been a fatal error-an error of the head but not of the heart. 
                  Thus passed the days, and he felt himself growing weaker. His hours were numbered, he knew. He sat down and wrote out his last will and testament, bequeathing all he had to his Hannah, wrote her a letter to pardon him-to think of him kindly, and not reproach Clarence for things that were past and beyond remedy and recall. After sealing these documents, he laid them with his diary in his bureau, then he retired to bed, though it was scarcely noon. A strange peace stole over him, and he was happy. He thought of his Hannah, and the impression the discovery would make upon her mind. The poor old man began to weep, for he felt convinced his memory would be blessed by the only woman he had ever loved. Thus he lay on his bed-for nearly an hour-imagining to himself the happiness his former love would derive from the knowledge that her Edgar had been true to her unto death. 
                  At once a change came over his face. It grew more thoughtful, and sadder. A doubt had crept into his mind. It troubled him; it directed his thoughts to a new danger. 
                  That diary-that book he had intended for Hannah to vindicate his character-might it not be the means of creating feelings of remorse in her own breast, and cause her unnecessary tears? Might it not become, as it were, a bone of contention between Clarence and herself, fertile with reproaches on either side? It is true the confessions contained in the diary would dispel many a mist from her eyes, and awaken in her a feeling of love for the man whose beacon star she had been, but whose ship of hope she had wrecked. She would certainly appreciate him better and love him more. But would not that weaken her affection for Clarence, create reproach in all probability, and thereby destroy her own happiness? Why should he desire that his Hannah should learn to know him for what he had been? Why should he be so selfish? Supposing she should not bless his memory? Would not the act-the sacrifice he was about to make-bless itself? 
                  He rose from his bed. He was scarcely strong enough to walk as far as his writing-desk, but he reached it at last. He took a blank paper and wrote out a check for twenty thousand dollars on a bank-not Morton's-in which he had that amount deposited. He also wrote a note to the banker to forward said sum to Mr. Clarence Broadwell, who should not be informed of the donor's name. After which he added the proper direction, inserted both the check and letter in an envelope, directed it carefully, then rang a small bell that brought the servant from the other room, and requested her to carefully mail it. This done, he rested for a moment, then got up and moved toward the bureau. His diary-a work of a lifetime-his will and letter to Hannah, still lay there. He raised them slowly from the shelf and placed them on his hand. Five minutes later he had arrived with them in front of the hearth; the next minute the flame grew brighter, and diary, will and letter-were ashes and belonged to the things that were. For some time his eyes were riveted on the yellow flame that had destroyed the written record of his life, but he trembled not-he sighed not-he wept not. He had done his duty-he had raised himself above his own desires-he had made the sacrifice, and was happy. 
                  Long and thoughtfully he stood there in front of the brightly-kindled fire in the hearth-long after the last vestige of his life's record had turned to ashes. At last a faint smile passed over his pale-deadly pale features, and his thin, white hand fumbled for a moment, near his breast, beneath his cambric. Slowly he untied a piece of linen that he had worn next to his heart for more than half a century, and then his eyes lowered upon the thing his hand was holding up to his view. It was then that a bright tear trickled down his ashy cheeks; it was then that he began to tremble and feel his strength give way. "BE HAPPY." He was gazing for the last time upon the bookmark-upon that souvenir of Hannah that said to him "BE HAPPY." He kissed, it, then consigned it to the flames. He waited until it was ashes, then turned around once more to seek his couch. It was only then that he discovered his utter inability to move. His limbs had almost grown stiff within the last few minutes. A chair stood behind him, and he intended to rest there for a while, but all that he could do was to hold tight to its back-nothing more. He could not move an inch. He felt that the least attempt to raise his foot would cause his fall. An expression of pain shot over his agonized features, then he raised his sad, dreamy black eyes-sad, dreamy and black as they had been in his childhood-longingly heavenward, and exclaimed, in a broken, agonizingly-pleading voice, "O, mother!' 
                  Hardly had the voice died away when the door opened and his servant returned from the post-office. Quick as feet could carry her she flew to the old, helpless man's assistance. "What in the world," said the astonished woman, "are you doing out here? Come, let me get you back to bed: you are too weak to be up." 
                  He said nothing in return, but placed his arm around her neck for support, then made an attempt to move his foot. "I can not," he said, and lowered his head upon her shoulder and began to weep. 
                  The servant was strong: Harland, a little bone and skin, was as light as a child. She saw how helpless he was, and, without saying a word, she raised him to her arms and carried him to his bed. She laid him down, straightened out his feet, smoothed his pillow, gently threw the blanket over him, then asked how he felt. 
                  A smile rested on his face, and he said "Well." He closed his eyes for a moment; but when they opened again he found his faithful servant still standing by his side. "How do you feel now?" she inquired, leaning toward his pillow. 
                  "Better," he lisped, then closed his eyes once more. He slept something like fifteen minutes. At last he raised himself up in bed. 
                  "Elizabeth!" 
                  The woman had no need to go to his bedside: she was already there. 
                  "What do you want, Mr. Harland?" she said, gently. 
                  "Have you mailed the letter?" 
                  "Yes, sir." 
                  "Thanks, Elizabeth." 
                  She helped him lay his head back upon the pillow. 
                  "Shall I make you something warm new?" she asked him. "Some little soup or coffee? You must take something, Mr. Harland, so you can get strong again. You are only weak, that's all. A little warm soup will do you a deal of good." 
                  So saying, she moved away, not seeing the faint smile her allusion to his growing strong again, had called upon his parched and bloodless lips. 
                  The soup had been made ready during the day; all it required now was to warm it. In less than five minutes Elizabeth stood before Clermont Harland's bedside, feeding him as she would have fed a little, helpless child. 
                  "How do you feel now?" she inquired, after he had taken several spoonsful. 
                  "Much better, much better." Then he waited till she had removed the plate before he added, "Elizabeth, you have been a good servant to me, and I want you to have better times when I am dead and gone." She raised her apron to her face and wept, but he continued: "Don't weep on my account, Elizabeth. It is better for me to die than to live after I have grown more helpless than an infant. I should only be a trouble to myself, and to you, Elizabeth. My race of life is run; I have seen almost a generation die out before me; why, then, should I rebel against a fate that sooner or later would be mine, as it must be that of every living being? So stop your tears: see, I am happy." 
                  And he was happy. A strange expression of peace lighted up his thoughtful eyes, and his pale face, though wrinkled and of an unearthly color, had something ethereally beautiful about it. 
                  The servant retired to the opposite corner of the room, and all was still and silent as the grave. Clermont Harland had closed his eyes, but he was far from being asleep. His mind wandered back to the years of his childhood, then over the subsequent scenes of his life. Every incident came up before his mental eye with a vividness that beggars description. He seemed to live his life over again, but the pangs that had attended it before were not part of it now. He saw the whole mirror pass before his mind without a single feeling of pain or regret. He appeared an unmoved spectator, calmly waiting for the curtain to drop over the scenes through which he had passed, like a storm-tossed bark upon the angry main, yearning to find a harbor of rest. All the passions were dead in him now, and he could calmly survey the whole area of the past-forgive those who had wronged him, and-forgive himself. 
                  Yes, he was happy. 
                  "Elizabeth." 
                  The faithful servant had heard his voice, and she rose from her chair and noiselessly approached his bedside. 
                  "Can I do any thing for you, Mr. Harland?" she said, smoothing down the soft white pillow upon which his deadly pale face lay. 
                  "No, Elizabeth, no. I do not want any thing. I feel much better than I did. Come nearer, Elizabeth. So. Now give me your hand. That's right. You have been with me a long time, Elizabeth-a very long time, and I was not always as good to you as I might have been." Here the faithful old servant began to shed tears and sob aloud. "Now don't weep, Elizabeth, else you will make me feel heavy-and I know you don't want me to feel heavy." 
                  "No, I don't," she interrupted him, sobbing. 
                  "Then dry your tears." 
                  "I will." 
                  But it was easier said than done. Her fit of crying rather increased than diminished. He waited a minute, then continued: 
                  "I feel myself passing away, Elizabeth; now tell me that you will forgive me when I am gone for the many harsh words I have at times unnecessarily given you." 
                  "Good God! how he talks! I can't listen to him;" and she walked back to her chair, sobbing. 
                  It was quiet and silent-quiet and silent as the grave-in the room. Clermont Harland had once more fallen asleep, and the servant was watching him from the opposite corner. The minutes grew into hours, and she fancied to hear his breath as he calmly slept upon his pillow. It was growing dark; at last she could not distinguish one object from another, but she lighted no lamp. She sat watching-looking into the grate where the fire was slowly dying out. 
                  Suddenly she raised her head, and a pang shot through her heart. She couldn't hear him breathe any longer. She jumped up, and with trembling hands lighted the lamp. She looked toward the bed, and beheld Clermont Harland in a sitting posture, looking at her with a strange, bewildered look. Her heart beat fast-she scarcely knew why-as she hastened to his side. 
                  "You have slept, Mr. Harland?" she said. "How do you feel now?" 
                  He seemed to grow still more bewildered, and she repeated the question. 
                  This time he answered-answered in a tongue that she could not understand. The cold beads of perspiration stood on her brow, and she trembled from head to foot. She spoke to him again, but he understood her not. He had forgotten all knowledge of the English, and was now speaking German. His mother-tongue was only at his command. In his dreams he had seen his father and mother; they had spoken to him in the language he had been first blessed in, and when he awoke he recollected no other. 
                  The servant got more and more frightened. She laid his snow-white head back upon the pillow. He did not seem to object to it, but still continued to address her in those foreign words even while his eyes closed once more. 
                  Now she hurried from the room to summons the neighbors to Harland's bedside. When she returned, some few minutes later, accompanied by them, she found him-dead. 
                  On the following day he was buried, and a small, plain slab shows to this day where his remains lie. Thousands and thousands have passed it, and may still pass it in the future, but who will ever know the greatness of the spirit that animated the little dust lying quietly there with its mother earth? 
                  But where is the glimpse of Paradise? 
                  There, there, kind reader, where he sleeps in peace, beyond the reach of all earthly woes. 
                
             
            THE END.
