            PREFACE. 
            THE circumstances giving birth to this work will be found so fully detailed in the opening chapter, that no prefatory explanation can be necessary. But a word or two on other points may seem proper in this place. As the reader may very readily imagine-though the action of the story lies upon the coast, it is not a mere vessel, but that nobler work, humanity, springing from the hand of God instead of that of man,-which is to be found Utterly Wrecked. The work, in fact, has a double intention. First, to delineate with faithfulness, and from data acquired through long residence and experience among them, the characters of the fishermen, surfmen and shore-residents of the Atlantic Coast of the Middle States-often maligned, not seldom favorably exaggerated, and rarely well-understood. Second, to illustrate, in a single character severely limned from real life in that region, the possibility of a series of wrongs and misfortunes, without any radical evil in the victim, gradually pressing down the noblest of men, until he ceases to possess the better attributes of manhood and becomes little less than demoniac in his despairing fight with destiny. Fortunately, in the economy of human life, gleams of light will often be found falling in the darkest places; and youth, love, merriment and mischief all have their share in the sad tragedy of the coast. So abundant have been the materials at command, that the faculty of choice has been much more employed than that of invention, in the construction and arrangement of this story; and it is hoped that no objection will be taken to the point of view of the immediate present being used when speaking of events occurring thirty to forty years ago.

               CHAPTER I. 
               THE TERROR OF TOPSAIL. 
               "HILLOA! hilloa! stop!" 
               I was a boy of ten years, brown eyed and curly headed, with my brain filled with the usual distracting problems which affect country boyhood, as to the means by which a more inevitable success at marbles could be secured, or a better set be given to the mainsail of a certain schooner of fifteen inches, lying carefully hidden away from a practical brother and a mischievous uncle in the left of the old wagon-house,-and with my pockets so correspondingly filled with marbles, a jack-knife, pencils, balls of cord, wooden bits for "playing horse," pieces of lead for fishing-line sinkers, fish-hooks, combs, scraps of paper and other absolute necessaries of that observant and troublesome age,-that my anatomical developments seemed (as I now remember them) about twice as wide at the hips as the shoulders. I was hurrying to school along a causeway over the meadows, that led from the village of Topsail, a mile down the coast to the spot where stood our district school-house of hemlock joist and clapboards, with hard backless benches, ingeniously carved desks, windows that admitted the rain but kept out the light, and an oblong box-stove in the centre that always seemed to have fire in it and out of it at those precise times when its presence or absence could make the body of the pupils restless and uncomfortable. 
               I need not pause to designate the peculiar locality of Topsail, which may need close looking to find, by that name, on any of the maps prepared through the arduous labors of the Coast Survey. Enough to say that the village lies near the shore edge of Seaboard County, on the coast of one of the Middle States which presents an extended front to the stormy and encroaching Atlantic,-and that it has grown, now, to be something more than the fishing-hamlet to which only it then made pretensions,-time, wealth and piety having crowned it with the neat white spire of a village church which adds materially to the respectability of its appearance as viewed from the land, and glimmers in the morning sunlight many a mile at sea. Why it was named Topsail (or Tops'l, in shore pronunciation) may perhaps be explained by saying that the coast line was just high enough to shut away from view, at any considerable distance from it, the hulls and lower sails of the coasting-vessels continually going up and down the beach, while their topsails were always in sight; and those who know the habits of the shoremen will readily realize the epigrammatic disposition which would have applied the name to the village and one of the adjoining inlets. 
               The time of which I write (ah, these involuntary confessions of age!) is something more than thirty years ago, and the changes of that time have swept away much that in its particular period seemed worthy of lasting remembrance. That they have not altogether obliterated the recollection of that line of coast, of its aspects or the events which then made it notable, is owing to the indelible power with which the circumstances surrounding childhood ever stamp themselves upon the ready and unburthened memory. 
               "Stop, there! stop! There is a man drowned, and we are going down to see him. Come, go along." 
               The cry came down the causeway behind me, and I recognized half a dozen of my little school-fellows, their limbs in hasty motion and their faces full of the importance assumed by all, be they older or younger, who have tidings of great weight to communicate. I paused, with the satchel swinging on my arm, and the boys came running up, each more out of breath than the other, in his anxiety to communicate the first word of the important matter. 
               "Who is drowned and where?" I asked, pausing between the recollection that the pedagogue was a Tartar, of Hibernian birth and bibulous propensities, given to the habit of punishing late hours at school with a big ruler,-and the desire to witness the fascinatingly terrible sight of which the boys were speaking. Curiosity had it a little, it is probable, from the first; still, the balance hung doubtful. 
               "Oh, we don't know who it is, and don't care, so that it's somebody! He lies down by the boat-houses. Tim Wells found the body and came up to tell about it. All the folks from the village are going down. Come along!" 
                
               "All the folks from the village" effected precisely what the boys had anticipated-did more than the pull by the arm with which at least two or three of them accompanied the statement. We never can resist the 
                     propenstiy
                     propensity
                   to do what "everybody else" is doing, especially if the prudence or policy of the art is a little questionable. I slung my satchel higher on my arm, remembered that floggings did not often kill, and seldom even manned, and went down with my tempters to the beach. Time and experience have trodden a long road together since that morning and I have looked upon the sea and its shore in nearly every changing phase of glory and terror; and yet through all I remember that moment, and most of the words then spoken, with as much distinctness as if the event had happened but yesterday. 
               The clear, bright morning sunlight was glittering on the waves of the Atlantic, and shining upon their silvery spray as they dashed to the beach before us. It was a little late in the season, and the sea was touched with the intense ultra-marine blue of October, which one sometimes catches even in an earlier month from the bluff or the piazza of the Ocean House at Newport. Two or three coasters were making the long plunging motion of fair weather and smooth sea, which seemed like so many bows to the land as they swept by upward or downward, a mile or two in the ofling; and in startling relief to the intense blue of sea and sky, as many sails of outward bound vessels flashed their white wings like sea-birds, on the very verge of the horizon. Sky and sea and sunlight were all in the full glory of their beauty; yet the human form marred all, as it has so often blotted and disfigured the most beautiful scenes in nature-the human form in death, the most painful of all spectacles, whatever stoicism and would-be philosophy may say to the contrary. 
               "All the village" had indeed hurried to the beach. There they were-men, women and children-apparently the whole hamlet emptied and the fishing-houses lying between it and the shore depopulated as well. A drowned man is not such a rarity on the sea coast as to induce a very extensive crowd-it is sad to say; and I knew at once that Tim Wells must have told something more at the village than my informants had heard. No ordinary man could thus have drawn the whole section. A woman, perhaps, or some person of note-something like this seemed inevitable, even to my young comprehension. They were preparing, as I reached the beach, to take up the body and deposit it in one of the lumbering fish-wagons belonging to the district, for conveyance to the village, where the Coroner would make his unavailing quest over it. 
               "Who is it?" I heard some of the new comers ask, before I saw the body, as they tried to press their way into the thin crowd surrounding the spot where it was lying. 
               "Who? Oh, don't you know? It is the Terror himself. He is gone at last." Then I did not wonder that the whole village and all the neighboring section had turned out to behold what followed the sad end. Boy as I was, I understood something of the appropriateness of the name, and knew that he had been indeed the terror of the coast, and yet that there had been that about him which commanded respect in spite of all that might have forfeited it. 
               "Poor old man!" 
               "How did it happen?" 
               "Nobody seems to know." 
               "He has not been seen for a day or two, they say." 
               "Well, he is better gone than here!" 
               Such were the exclamations which I heard as I succeeded in doing what some of my more modest companions had failed to do,-pushed my way through the outer crowd and caught a first sight of the stalwart form extended upon the sand. 
               "Better? Yes, Heaven rest him!" This came from the lips of one of the women with bared heads and work-day aprons, who had deserted their household labors when the men left their more robust employments,-and was by far the most humane and considerate of any word that I had heard spoken. 
               Again the question was asked: "How was he drowned?" 
               "Nobody knows how it happened," was the reply of one of the persons who were about taking up the body. "He drove ashore with the flood this morning and Tim Wells found him, but he was so frightened that he only stopped to see who it was." 
               "What is the use of asking questions?" commented another of the neighbors. "It is easy enough to know how he died. No sea ever ran that could drown him, old as he was; and there is no mark of violence on his body-I have been looking to see, and there is not a scratch. He drowned himself-depend upon it!" 
               "Hush-h-h!" was the admonitory response of one of the more thoughtful ones. "Some of his relatives may be near, and there is no use hurting their feelings, you know!" 
               "Fudge!" said a bluff-spoken old fisherman whom they called Tad (no doubt Thaddeus) Wilson. "His relatives are not fools, if there are any of them around-leastways there is no occasion of their being fools. Everybody knows that the Terror of Topsail has not been responsible for his actions, this many a year. He drowned himself, without a doubt of it!" 
               "Drowned himself? It is dreadful to think so!" shuddered another of the women who stood near. 
               "Why, I should like to know!" rejoined the old fisherman. "Hadn't he a right to go away when he got tired of staying, just as any one of us would have to go home when he got tired of paying a visit? Hold your tongue, Susan Chase, and don't you go for to tell us any of that stuff that they preach sometimes up at the church-so they say, I haven't any time to go there,-about its being worse for a man to stop breathin' when he gets tired than to rob or murder or tell lying stories about his neighbors. Don't you go for to tell that, Susan Chase, for we've just heard enough of it, and we don't believe it any more than we do that sea-bass will bite at cotton wadding and think that it's soft-clam!" 
               "I should think that he might have been tempted to make away with himself, with the weight that rested on his old head and shoulders, and the cries of the drowned that he must have heard in his sleep any time this ten years back! If ever a man has excuse for suicide, he had, if it was flying in the face of God!" 
               It was a young man who spoke-evidently a man of education and refinement, sickly but intellectual looking, who had been spending the summer on the shore, from one of the near cities, and who had not hurried away when the last of September brought the autumnal equinox. He was well-dressed and showed natural superiority, so that the shoremen (the last in the world long to ignore merit or be imposed upon by any specious pretence) treated him with great consideration. 
               "Right, Squire, as a hickory thole-pin!" said Wilson. "I am proud to have a man of larnin', like you, join with an ignorant one like me in shootin' straws through some of that old nonsense!" 
               "Suicide! who says that he committed suicide?" and a thin-faced man in a threadbare black suit and a white neck-cloth elbowed his way through the crowd and stood close beside the body. 
               "I said so-got anything to say agin it?" answered the old fisherman, with a glance at the new comer which showed that he had seen him before and did not hold him in the very highest regard. 
               "Here, bear a hand, men, and help us get him into the wagon!" at this stage of the proceedings said Strong, one of the men who were about to remove the body. "The Coroner may be sometime a sittin' on him, and we must get him into Poplar graveyard before the sun sets, or there will be worse luck on the coast." 
               "What do you mean?" said the thin-faced man, lifting up his hands in that expression of pious horror which used to be reckoned a religious demonstration by others besides Mawworm. "You believe that this man has committed suicide and you know what his life has been, and yet you expect to bury him in a church-yard! This is horrible! Such a miscreant should be sent to the doctors for dissection, or buried at two cross-roads with a stake driven through him to mark the hatred of his crimes borne by all Christian men." 
               "Humph!" said Wilson, with a threatening mischief in his eye. "Nim Belden, you are a Christian man, I believe? You pray and exhort, up there in the church, don't you?" 
               "Not in the church, but at meeting," answered the thin-faced man, with a curl of the lip and nose at mentioning the word "church"-"and I trust and believe that I am a Christian man." 
               "'Spect to go to Heaven when you die, don't you?" was the next enquiry of Wilson. 
               "I hope to do so," answered Belden, taking the occasion to look in the traditionally supposed direction of that land towards which we are all travelling so slowly or backwards. 
               "Then," said the old fisherman, "the man who helps you there does you a good turn; and ef you stay here jest two minutes more, with that howlin' about makin' 'natomies of people and buryin' em with sticks druv through em, jest because they haven't happened to leave the world in a manner that suits you, you'll get where you want to go, afore you leave, for we'll keel-haul you through that surf there until your own mother wouldn't know you from a dead man!" 
               "Touch me, if you dare!" said the man with the white cravat; but his face was nearly as pale as his neck-cloth, and he did not look personally half so confident as his words sounded. 
               "Mort!-Joe!-two or three of you hand that white-throated black snake here! He wants to be a water-snake." 
               But if any one tried to do so, no one laid hands upon Mr. Belden. He appeared just then to remember a pressing engagement elsewhere, and slipped away as quickly and almost as noiselessly as if he had belonged to the reptile tribe so forcibly alluded to by the old fisherman. There was no other objection, I think, to the dead man's receiving the most sacred rites of sepulture, whatever might have been the hideous secrets of his past life and sudden death. I knew little or nothing of the name or works of William Shakspeare, then; I know far too little of those glorious records of human genius, now, though I have lived to see the great dramatist's tercentenary: but I have never heard, on any stage, the priest croning out his dissatisfaction at being forced to give Christian burial to Ophelia, and the indignant burst of Laertes: 
                      
                        "-I tell thee, churlish priest, 
                        A ministering angel shall my sister be, 
                        When thou liest howling!" 
                     
                   without being carried back to the point just recorded, of my boyish days, and seeing Tad Wilson, that grim substitute for the Danish noble, sending into such hasty exile the man who put himself forward to hurl the same horrible canon of uncharitableness against the dead man bearing so little resemblance to the gentle and wronged White Blossom of Elsinore. 
               It was settled, I think, in the minds of most of the shoremen, that the man who lay there stiffened in death, had drowned himself in the last despair of a life that had outlived hope. I was too young, then, to have much judgment of the probabilities that might have brought him to his end. I only knew what he was said to have been, and that he was lying dead before me. His tall form lay extended upon the beach dressed as I had seen him so many times in life, in heavy loose coat and trowsers of sailor blue, rusty with long wear, a red shirt without neck-cloth, and stout boots of cowhide. His hard, brown face was upturned to the morning sun, the eyes half-closed and staring frightfully; and his long white hair lay damp around his head, and fell away upon the beach, plastered with the sand. I was not old enough to draw the comparison then, but it has come to me many times since: lying there on the shore, he was peculiarly in place, to one who knew the character and history of that coast, a stout, noble vessel, bearing the marks of storm and hardship, and at last-utterly wrecked.
                
               The body was at last removed from its melancholy resting-place, conveyed to the fish-wagon, and the concourse set out for the village. Probably none was ever borne on its way to the grave, amid so strange and contradictory emotions. It was evident that scarcely one of all who had known him in life, but regarded the dead body with something akin to horror and shuddering; and yet there seemed to be scarcely one (the human black-snake out of the way) who did not blend with that sentiment one little akin to it, and say some word over or around the senseless form, bespeaking the existence of a hopeless and sorrowful pity. 
               The occurrence was one of sufficient interest to break up school for the day, even the pedagogue having a curiosity to know all that had occurred, to make himself a small hero by mingling among the knots of talkers and telling what he knew about the man of whom all knew too much, and to take the indefinite number of free drinks that might be offered him at the principal village tavern in honor of the melancholy occasion. So I escaped my flogging at school-a fact which may or may not have tended to my advantage in the days that were soon to follow. 
               Before noon, in the "spare-room" of the tavern at the village, Coroner Wyke held his inquest, picking up his jurymen from the bar-room, the little blacksmith shop and other places of similar convenience. Of course, like most other Coroners who hold inquests, he elicited nothing that had not been generally known in advance; but unlike some other Coroners who have held inquests during the nineteenth century, he escaped eliciting anything positively false and injurious. The verdict was a brief one: "Found drowned," and with it there was not even a carping newspaper to express dissatisfaction. 
               The Terror of Topsail was borne to his burial in Poplar graveyard, two miles away from the little village, southward and inland, the same afternoon. Such news as that of his death spreads rapidly, in a sea-shore section, even beyond the immediate settlement that is most interested; and though the funeral took place within an hour after the closing of the Coroner's inquest, it seemed that the whole country, for many miles in every direction, had turned out, old and young, of every station and calling, to witness the obsequies of the strange man with the stranger name. With so many persons present, conferring a patent of respectability for the moment upon the dead man, the Reverend Septimus Puddler, who came down from the back country to fill this out-station and preach the sermon, was driven to speak more favorably of the deceased than he was in the habit of doing at the burial of less wealth than thirty or forty thousand. And so the Terror of Topsail went to his long home, as his soul had but a few hours before gone into the presence of the All-seeing, to be more intelligently pronounced upon than catchers of fish or curers of souls had the power to judge the lights and shadows, the rights, wrongs and temptations, of his singular and eventful career. 
               All the years before named have gone by, and the incidents of that chequered career have never been related, that I am aware, beyond the circle of those who knew him in life. Sea-shore story and legend are voluminous, but they seldom reach far unless the immediate section happens to give birth or furnish residence to such a restless, unquiet and no doubt injurious person as a professional author. Yet those incidents have a fearful interest, while their relation necessarily involves some developments of character little known to the general public, and that do not often creep into the pages of romance. To deal with the Terror of Topsail is to deal with the men (and the women) who surrounded him in life-to spread, as it were, the very scenes among which he lived, before the eye of the reader, who may be pardoned for thinking some of them unnatural, as compared with those upon which his own eyes have rested,-to catch the very roar of the surf and the salt aroma of the sea under the south-easter, and bring them into the midst of a life in which other sounds fill the ears and other perfumes appeal to the senses. Yet the narration is worthy of being made, and the delay of so many years has been rather a matter of necessity than of choice. More than a decade after, when I came to man's estate and would have penned the record, there were yet living some who could have been pained by it, and I forbore. 
               Since then, distance as well as time has intervened; and I had almost forgotten the whole series of events, in the employments and sensations of later years, when a few months since, lounging through the vestibule of one of the places of afternoon amusement in the great city, I saw the sturdy pea-jacketed form and grizzled hair of one of the Wreckers of Topsail who had been men to my own boyhood, and felt the hearty grasp of his hard hand, so used to the oar and the cod-line, that almost crushed into pulp my own enervated fingers. Then I saw a face at the opera, one night not long after, strangely connected with that rough figure. One glance or one word sometimes unlocks the past that has been equally shut away from thought and speech; and so it was in this instance. From the moment of that glance and that grasp, with the operatic vision following, something like the woe against silence, pronounced upon the old prophets who hesitated in their duty, seized upon me, and I became again the Ancient Mariner, doomed to buttonhole not one unfortunate but a few thousands. And this is the story,-oddly blended of sorrow and joy, crime and bravery, suffering and merriment,-which I learned so long ago, before and after the sad sight that I saw when going to school. 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               THE HOME AND THE LIFE OF BARNARD NORTH. 
               THE home to which Barnard North brought his family from the rough coasts of New England, in 18-, lay within two hundred yards of the beach and something more than a mile seaward from the fishing-hamlet of Topsail. It was a very humble but comfortable little cottage, built by some predecessor in the rugged mysteries of shore-craft, but far superior to those with which the coast was studded at irregular intervals, and with many conveniences added to the original building after their removal from the East, by the care of the young husband and the taste of his wife. It had at first been merely a story-and-a-half cottage, with the end facing the sea, whitewashed without and unceiled within, the whole lower story thrown into one large room, and the sleeping apartments on the second floor reached by an ordinary ladder little less rough than those upon which the carpenters of the time carried up their backloads of pine shingles when housebuilding: before the time of which I write the one room had been divided into two, the inner ceiled and whitewashed as a "best room" while the other was devoted to the purposes of ordinary life, and a neat enclosed stairway leading up from the outer room to the sleeping apartments had taken the place of the rude ladder. In the "best room" yellow "Windsor" chairs, with bottoms of woven rushes and wreaths of gaudy flowers in staring green and impossible red ornamenting the backs, had supplanted the unbacked wooden settles of the original erection; snowy white curtains had fluttered up to the windows accustomed to the staring sunlight or rude shades of rolled paper; and the boards of the floor had grown modest and hidden themselves away under a soft though coarse conglomerate of dark fabric, woven by the lame weaver up at the village, made of list, yarn, fragments of homespun cloth, scraps of white muslin and an occasional thread of the softer pickings of hempen rope, and known from the days of the Revolution even up to the present ascendency of Wilton and Axminster, as "rag carpet." In the corner of that "best room" stood a neatly valanced low bed, sacred from use by any one of the occupants of the house, and always waiting to confer the supreme honors of hospitality. In the outer room the floor was still bare, and there were no flowers on the board-bottomed chairs; but there were well polished brass tops to the andirons in the broad fire-place, that diffused an aroma of salt through the room from the driftwood commonly used as fuel; the floor was so well polished by frequent scrubbings that the laying down of a carpet would have seemed little less than sacrilege; and cheap white crockery had taken the place of the red earthen and battered pewter once scantly filling the little unpainted pine dresser; while on the top shelf of that article of furniture there were even half a dozen books, old and thumbed, no doubt, but still evidences of culture and refinement not to be looked for at that day in an ordinary fisherman's hut on the Atlantic coast of the Middle States. 
               The causeway of which mention has before been made as extending down the coast for some miles, formed an angle immediately in front of the house and extended back towards the village, making the road over the marshy meadow, by which most of the travel between the beach and the back country was necessarily transacted. It was upon the edge of the causeway and almost in the angle formed by it in turning southward, that the house of Barnard North stood, a small shed out-house behind it at the distance of only a few yards, and a little paled garden-spot adjoining, wrested from the salt marsh by long and toilsome exertion and the carting down of many loads of fertile loam from the main land beyond, enabling the shoreman to fill up profitably an occasional leisure hour, and at least partially to supply his family with the vegetables necessary for winter use. 
               The situation commanded a full view of the sea, no other house being near, and no other in the neighborhood so well overlooking it. The village of Topsail was shut away by a long low line of scrubby woods, such as only could thrive in the immediate neighborhood of the sea, dwindling to a few stunted shrubs as the edge of the meadow was reached, where the easterly storms broke with their full force; and all beyond, except the little spot of garden ground adjoining that single dwelling, entirely bare and barren. 
               To an eye accustomed to the softer and richer peculiarities of inland scenery in that latitude, it was a desolate spot where Barnard North had fixed his place of abode. The dwelling standing so totally alone-the long trampled causeway with the bare white beach beyond, and its few scattering boats-the great wild sea stretching out to the horizon, only occasionally relieved by the passage of a fishing-boat between the shore and the fishing-ground far out at sea-now and then a glimpse of some schooner going up or down the coast-and a single white speek by day and a twinkle of fire by night showing the location of the light-house that marked the entrance of the inlet two miles above. 
               A desolate spot, in many aspects, and grandly desolate, not more from its topographical features than its historical surroundings. For then, and for many a year before, the Topsail beach, and indeed the whole coast line of Seaboard, might well have been called the burying-ground of ships. There was scarcely a yard of it that had not held, at one time or another, the dead body of a shipwrecked man, or the broken timbers of a stranded vessel, to which he had vainly trusted for safety. Scarcely a mile of it, then or after, that did not supply some suggestive view of a single mast, bleached and cracked in the sunshine and the storm, yet standing erect with a frayed rope swinging from its splitting cross-trees, to tell that once it had carried the white canvas of a vessel, and that under it an oaken floor had once borne the lives of gallant men. Beneath it, the stern or stern-post and a few of the side timbers of a stout vessel might protrude from the whelming sand, and another mast thrown prostrate, a wheel, and the remains of a shattered yawl, crowning one of the near banks, tell the remainder of the melancholy story. 
               For melancholy, there and elsewhere, has ever been the spectacle of destruction by wave and wind, whether human life has or has not perished in the same catastrophe. A fallen warrior on a battle field, is scarcely sadder to the sight than a broken wreck on shore. There is the same suggestions of broken pride and ruined strength in both-the same reminder of a conflict long sustained, but given up at last. We feel the same grief over wasted capabilities-the same hopeless pity when we remember that they cannot be revived, to fill their places of old. That nameless rhymer was moved by the true feeling when he wrote, addressing the ships in the glory of their beauty and the pride of their motion, and looking sadly forward to the day of storm and wreck and the things so sure to follow it: 
                      
                        "-Your bleaching ribs, on some deserted coast, 
                        May wear the strange, wild horror of a ghost, 
                        Or make the eyes, years hence, that o'er them bend, 
                        Drop tears as on the body of a friend." 
                     
                   And the man who can pass a shivered wreck, with the waves breaking over her in cruel mockery, and plank by plank swept away by each succeeding storm and blast-with the rotting rope swinging idly, and the broken chain rusting away to fragments,-the man who can do this, and feel no sensation of sorrow, no choking in the throat, or moistening of the eyes,-is so heartless that he should never be trusted with a hold upon the heartstrings of others-should never be selected as an adviser in grief, or a watcher beside the dying bed! 
               That beach had witnessed scenes of heroism and forgetfulness of personal danger in the rescue of the perishing, sufficient to raise the race of shoremen to the rank of demigods; and it had witnessed, too, the cold and cruel neglect of those who had no pity in their hearts for the suffering-the apathy of men outraged by charges of piracy, until they almost ceased to be human-the reckless deed of the beach-pirate and the murderer! Every exposed sea-coast of the civilized world divides this glory and this shame-the sand of Barnegat echoes back to the iron rocks of Cornwall in both-and out upon the man who would ignore the good on account of the evil, and affix an indiscriminate brand of shame upon either! 
               The shoremen of this section, in the days of Barnard North, were fishermen by profession, as they were wreckers by necessity. From the inlet above, for many a mile below at irregular intervals, the fishing boats could be seen drawn up on the beach, through the afternoons of the calm weather, waiting for the early morning that was to send them off to the "banks" for codfish in early winter, or sea-bass and porgies in spring and summer. And when the dawn was just breaking, literal fleets of those cockle-shells, each manned by one or two sturdy rowers, would be seen slipping off from the shelving beach, gliding away from the land, spreading a little sail of doubtful whiteness, to catch the land breeze and save the tough sinews, and finally lying for hours like little specks on the sea-line, while the fishermen drew in their finny spoil. Then, when the sun was westering in the same fine weather, the beach for miles would be quite alive with the coming in of the returning boats, the pleasant toil of landing the fish they had taken, and the gathering of wagons from the back country, to bear away the "catch" for consumption or a market. 
               But when the east wind came with a stronger breath-when the sea-scud came driving in for a night or two, and the breakers began to dash more heavily on the white beach and against the edge of the causeway-then the quick eyes told the omens unerringly, no fisherman launched, and the shore was deserted. The fishing-boats were all drawn up beyond the reach of the waves, and the hardy men who rowed them left the beach for their rugged but cozy homes, until the coming of fairer weather. Nothing was to be seen, when the storm had really burst, but the white breakers, as they flashed to the very edge of the causeway, and sometimes broke full over it-the fierce lashing of the baffled waves beyond; the wing of a sea gull as he revelled shrieking in the storm; and away on the sea line, sometimes, the shortened canvas of a vessel driving rapidly to leeward before the gale. 
               Sadder sights than these came when stout ships, driven in by false currents or gales too powerful to be breasted, struck on the bar that stretched away half a mile seaward, and lay there, with the sea breaking over them, until masts went by the board, and timbers gave way before the might of the waves that had grown to be sledge-hammers swung by the Titans; and wails that reached even to the shore went up as hundreds of living beings were launched at once into the sea to struggle vainly and drown miserably. Then it was that the fishermen became wreckers, or as they called themselves, "surfmen" and "shoremen." Then it was that in those cockle-shell boats the boldest and most faithful of them launched from that rough beach through surf that threatened instant death at every moment of those mad adventures; and then it was that they brought ashore many a precious freight of human life, of which the world heard nothing or heard falsely, or that they turned a sadder page in the providence of God, drowned with those they had attempted to rescue, and left other widowed wives and fatherless children to demand pity and succor from those who had little to spare and yet no heart to refuse. And it was after such scenes that those still darker ones occurred which cursed the name of the coast as they have cursed every sea-coast under the broad eye of heaven-robbing the corpses thrown on the beach by foundered ships; even crushing out the little breath left in half-drowned men, to rob them of the gold that spanned waist or made a fatal weight in pocket! 
               Among all the shoremen of that long line of coast-fishermen, surfmen, everything that was boldly and determinedly amphibious-never had a stronger arm pulled at the ashen oar than that of Barnard North, the occupant of that little cottage at the elbow of the causeway. None had launched so often in the very face of death, to come back in safety with a precious burden of rescued life or the consciousness that all human energy had been tasked to save it. His house commanding the most prominent view, for many miles, of vessels in distress, he seemed to others to be, and no doubt felt himself to be, something like the guardian of the coast; and when no help but his own was near, often in darkness as well as in storm, he launched alone, with his young wife and his children watching and weeping as the rain dashed against the pane, praying that his errand of mercy might not be fruitless, and that at least, if no rescue was possible, the husband and father might be spared to them. And within the walls of that little home, many a time and of, rescued men knelt to implore blessings on their preserver, or lay in that long stupor which succeeds restoration after half-drowning; and the liberal hands of the shoreman and his wife grudged neither food nor attention that could complete their work and bring back those to full life who had once been partially severed from it. 
               He seemed, to many, and became an object of wondering interest over broad miles of country on that account,-to bear a charmed life. Others were drowned who dared not half the perils that he habitually encountered: he came back from the rashest ventures safe; and before many years had passed after his removal to the coast of Seaboard, he grew to be known as an embodiment of a class, and to be spoken of, even on far-distant lines of coast, as "Barney North, the Wrecker of Topsail." 
               Perhaps he indeed bore a charmed life, as no doubt many do who go beyond the common risks of humanity and so place themselves under the protection of a peculiar providence; but he had a guaranty of safety even beyond this, that other men could not have dared count upon like himself. Nurtured on the wild New England coast, and sprung from a race of hardy men who had two centuries before conquered the savages and their wilderness, and half a century before begun to lay the sea under domination in the whaling-ships of Nantucket and New London,-Barnard North was almost a giant in stature and quite a giant in the strength of his sinewy limbs. He had measured six feet at twenty, and when at thirty he came upon the coast, not less than three or four inches had been added to his stature. A form well rounded, with a chest like that of the Farnese Hercules, his thick brown hair falling around a well shaped head and crowning a heavily moulded but manly face, with a deep blue eye, and dense brown beard of which the razor touched only the upper lip,-he looked, in his jaunty shoreman's rig, the very ideal of the King of the Storm and the Wreck. 
               Barnard North had better warrant for keeping the proverbial neatness of his appearance, even in his wild, rough life, than most men could have shown. The shoreman had a sweet and gentle wife, the daughter of a good family, who had left all, nearly a score of years before, to share his home, spite of the disapprobation of her parents; and between them, through all the trials and vicissitudes of that extended period of married life, there had always existed the dear fondness of early lovers conjoined with that soberer and steadier affection which grows of long companionship and mutual dependence. Of more than medium height and a figure exquisitely but strongly rounded, Rachael North, though verging at this time upon thirty-five, had lost but little of her early beauty and nothing whatever of her attractiveness. There was scarcely a line upon her pleasant face, a little too long for perfect grace, and with something of the Yankee type always noticeable; her very dark brown hair, approaching black, had not yet one thread of doubtful silver to mark the middle of the track of life; and her dark hazel eyes seemed yet to have retained the light as well as the loving warmth that had so many years before driven the handsome Triton from his usual propriety. She was indeed a fitting mate for her noble husband; and though she had by no means learned, in all those years, to share his insensibility to danger, yet no doubt the very womanly tenderness and trembling anxiety of her nature made her the dearer to the man who actually seemed to know no fear. So many years of married life, and thus far no shadow between them-the picture (one in no wise exaggerated) is worth thought and may possibly be worth envy!
                
               But not alone on the wife whom he felt that he had worthily won and honorably maintained, were the home affections of the wrecker centred. Before their coming to the Sea-board coast three children had blessed their union, and a fourth was added soon after their removal. Three were boys-the eldest, the third and fourth, each giving promise of inheriting the father's sturdy form and brave heart; the second a daughter, with her mother's dark brown eyes and gentle disposition, but with a form so much more fragile than might have been expected from such parentage, that those who looked upon her with admiration sometimes thought of the failing health that might so easily come before she had reached the full glory of womanhood. 
               Roughly as the winds might blow without, and fierce as might be the waves he was called to buffet, Barnard North knew that a haven of peace ever existed in his household, and that hope and honor dawned in the young lives that had sprung from his wedded years. He might be poor in the "Warl's gear," but who could be richer in more enduring wealth, than the man who carried a brave heart and a strong arm, trusted in God and did his duty nobly, and owned a very heaven of domestic love and honor to welcome him when the toil and the danger were over? 
               Such was the home of the Wrecker of Topsail, and such were the inmates who made it a home indeed, in the autumn of 18-his eldest son, Robert, then a fine, well-grown lad of seventeen; his daughter Charlotte, the female bud of promise of the household-a few weeks older than fifteen; and the two younger boys, William and Barnard, respectively thirteen and eleven. 
             
             
               CHAPTER III. 
               THE TWENTY-FOURTH OF SEPTEMBER. 
               THE twenty-fourth of September, 18-, has been ever since remembered from one end to the other of the coast of the United States-from Maine to Florida,-as one of the most fearful periods in the memory of the dwellers by the sea. The people of each particular line of coast believed that the gale had spent there the very worst of its violence, because it seemed impossible that the same fury could have been so widely disseminated-just as some persons, suffering under peculiarly heavy visitations of misfortune, are slow to believe that there can have been enough calamity in all God's providence to give others the same share of wretchedness as themselves. It was indeed such a day and such a night as almost justified a belief that each had been specially visited. Old men yet living speak of the violence of the wind and the mad fury of the sea on that day, as something almost supernatural, and the "September gale" is yet quoted as if no one could possibly mistake in what September the great calamity occurred. On the firm land and far away from the exposed sea coast, not only fell old giants of trees that had been deep rooted for half a dozen centuries, but low dwellings that seemed scarcely to invite the wind went with them, crashed to their foundations. Scarcely an earthquake that ever desolated the tropics huddled more frightened women and children in what they believed to be places of comparative shelter, or induced the utterance of more of those agonized prayers which arise from white lips and terrified hearts. But on the coast-ah, there seemed to fall the peculiar vengeance of the hand of God. Scores of wrecked ships, proud in the strength of man's handiwork but the day before-thousands of perished lives and a sea-line devastated as far as the eye could reach or the ear take in the accounts brought by others,-all these on that fatal day bore witness that the demon of the storm had been abroad on the most fearful of his errands. 
                
               The night of the twenty-third (the equinox, as defined by the astronomers and duly marked by the almanac of "David Young, Philom," who was the Arago and the Tuttle of that day-in America,) closed dark and sullen. The sound of the surf had increased during the afternoon from the gentle undertone of fine weather to a deep and terrible thunder-peal that vibrated the earth for miles away from the sea; the wind grew wilder and fiercer every hour, as the night approached; and the sea-scud came driving in, chill and fast, growing denser and denser continually, except as the storm wind actually tore it to ribbons and blew it away. The sea-fowl, frightened from the deep water, flew screaming near the coast, and as the night fell disappeared altogether-to what retreat from the coming storm the sagest naturalist may never know any more surely than the pet school-boy busy with his primer. 
               During the afternoon, under the warning of omen and experience, the fishing-boats along the Topsail beach were all drawn high up on the embankment and firmly secured; and the rough shoremen, their labors rendered for the time impossible, before nightfall sought their homes, as the driving rain began to blend with the gale. Fires were lighted that night in houses in which they were seldom lit so early in the season, for the cold became almost as intense as that of winter; and sitting comfortably housed, as the hoarse roar of the sea came up, these hardy men said, as they shrugged their shoulders at the thought and the chill: 
               "A wild night, and it will be a wilder one before morning! God help those who are on the coast!-they will need stout hearts and strong arms before this gale blows over!" 
               There was little sleep in the house of Barnard North that night, at least to the Wrecker and his wife-perhaps the weight of young blood may have rested upon the eyes of the youngsters, so that they forgot noise and peril and passed away to that life of dreams which is not always more peaceful than walking. Both the Wrecker and his wife knew and feared. Familiarity with storm and wreck and suffering had done nothing to blunt the kindness of heart of the strong man; and the terrors of the gale, nothing to him, seemed all that was fearful for others. For hours that night he walked the floor of his cabin, his heavy tread keeping irregular time with the beat of the sea upon the beach, that kept the house in a continual slight quiver-pausing ever and anon to approach the window and peer out into the darkness that the shrouded moonlight could only half dispel, through the rain which the still increasing gale sent whirling and dashing against the pane. 
               During all these hours Rachael North plied her needle with unsteady hand, and more as if the body needed occupation to prevent the mind becoming too powerful for it, than with any thought of making her labor profitable. All the while she was listening to the weary tread of her husband on the uncarpeted floor of that outer room, his occasional words of anxiety, and the wild rushing of the storm without. 
               "Go to bed, husband!" at length she said, as the drift-wood burned low in the fire-place and the hand of the old bull's-eye watch that hung above the mantel pointed to far past midnight. "God help the sailors, in this pitiless storm, as you say," she continued after a moment's pause; "but remember that we should be thankful for being housed and sheltered." 
               "So I am, Rachael-so I am!" said Barnard North, pausing not in his heavy walk, except to peer once more out of the rain-washed window into the thick obscurity. "So I am; but I cannot rest in peace while I hear this hoarse roar coming up from the sea that I know must swallow so many before morning." 
               "Commend them to God, Barnard!" replied the wife, who had forgotten nothing of her staid New England education. "He only can shelter them, and He will do so if it is His will." 
               "Humph, yes, I know it, and yet I do not like to trust to providence altogether!" said the man who cared to know much less of theology than of practical effort and benevolence. "You didn't trust to providence for tucking away the young ones, to-night, did you. Rachael? No-you did it yourself. Providence is a good thing when a man is drowning, but I believe a little in a good stout boat and somebody to row it. Maybe providence intended that I should be out tonight, trying to do my duty; and here I am, not doing it, while many a brave fellow may be drowning like a rat, almost within hearing. If the moon was larger and the rain and scud did not make it too thick to see anything, I should be on the beach or off it-be sure of that wife!-instead of moping here like a sick kitten!" 
               "I am very glad, then, that it is dark, Barnard!" said the fearful wife, shuddering, in spite of herself, at the very thought of such a mad exposure. "When men do not know what is good for them, it is well that they are watched over and guided beyond themselves. You have risked your life often enough to save the perishing, and the pitcher that goes too often to the well gets to have careless hands holding it and comes back broken at last! Even your strength should not tempt that of God!" 
               "True, true, wife!" said Barnard North after a moment of pause. "I could not do anything, even if I was out there; and I suppose there is no use of finding fault with what cannot be helped. I must try to shut out this roar from my ears, in sleep, if I can." He made a movement towards the door leading up to the sleeping-rooms above, then started almost as if a bullet had suddenly stricken him. "Hark! was not that a hail?" and again he was at the window, striving to peer out through that which no mortal eye could pierce. 
               "Only the moaning of the wind," answered Rachael North, after pretending to listen a moment. She spoke quickly and hurriedly, for she was doing what the recording angel had seldom set down to her account-lying! Her heart stood nearly still as she uttered those words, for she had heard, in that instant of pause, so distinctly that there was not even room for one merciful doubt, a cry of mortal terror. "Only the moaning of the wind," she compelled herself to repeat, perhaps because the words filled a silence which she dared not trust. "You are nervous to-night, Barnard! Why do you not go to bed, as you started to do?" 
               "Nervous? yes, I suppose I must be," he answered, turning on her a face racked by contending emotions. "Nervous, and who knows but I have cause to be? Rachael, I do not know why it should be so, but I feel to-night just as if some part of my plain duty was being left undone-though I cannot see any way to do it,-and as if some heavy judgment hung over me on account of it!" 
               "Pshaw!" said the wife, though her face was white and her words came with difficulty. 
               "Pshaw? That means you do not believe it, wife, and perhaps you are right. But hark! Again!" There was terrible silence in that room for the moment that followed. Then the Wrecker approached the chair where his wife was sitting, stooped his tall form and seized her arm with his strong grasp. "Rachael North, you must have heard that sound, or you are growing deaf! I heard the call of human voices, almost as plainly as if they had been sounding in that front room. Some vessel has been going to pieces on the bar, and there has been no one to answer that cry for help. Do you tell me now, that you did not hear it?" 
               "The wind, I tell you, Barnard-only the wind!" She did not raise her head but kept her eyes steadily upon that sewing which seemed just then to be of so much importance. The trembling woman could not; for, shuddering with the idea that her husband might be induced, under that terrible excitement, to rush down to the beach and plunge into some deadly and useless peril, she was again belying her ears and her heart. She had again caught that dreadful sound, in the moment of pause, and recognized it but too well; but she dared not be truthful. "Listen-you hear nothing now!" she added, as if something more was necessary. 
               "Nothing? No! It is all still, now!" replied Barnard North sadly, leaning his head upon his hands, and his hands upon the mantel. "All still-too still! There may be an hundred voices made still forever in that silence." 
               "You torture yourself, and frighten me, Barnard, without the "possibility of doing good to any one!" said the wife, uttering that truth almost petulantly. For household angels (and the Wrecker's wife had certainly so far been one of the truest of them) have means for expressing vexation, and do not always speak in honeyed words, even though the lips themselves be honeyed. 
               Barnard North turned away from the mantel, saying: "Well, Rachael, no doubt you are right. Lay by your sewing, then, and come to bed," and passed up-stairs, to the sleeping-room, to which the nervous wife, almost afraid of being left alone in the lower part of the house while such sounds grieved the air, in a few moments after followed him. 
               But broken and frighted indeed, was the rest achieved by either, during the weary remnant of that night. For the nerves of the shoreman had been wrought up to too high a tension to be calmed at once; and it was only after unnumbered tossings and turnings that at last he fell into an uneasy slumber, less refreshing than entire wakefulness-to hear in his feverish dreams the thunder of the surf and the cries of those who seemed to be perishing without an attempt at succor. 
               Rachael North, though she retired soon after her husband, did not make even his poor attempt at sleeping. Spite of the words of doubt she had spoken to her husband, she fully realized, as we have seen, and realized with a shuddering horror, for which the language has scarcely expression,-that there had indeed been a fearful tragedy enacted so near her that the cries of the perishing had power to reach her ears. And even beyond this, there had been brooding over her, during all that painful evening, a feeling of loss and sorrow-a fearful foreboding to which her heart was too blind to give a name; that desolate feeling, added to and deepened by the words of the same character which her husband had uttered the moment before retiring, until her brain seemed to be whirling on the very edge of madness, and the heart in her bosom lay like a lump of lead, that could never again be awakened to hope and happiness. There seemed to be but little, indeed, to have caused all this distraction-no personal loss had really occurred or been nearly threatened; but who knows how often or how unerringly the powers that see beyond time and space, reveal to us the future in words that we are too hurried to hear and too dull to understand? 
               The cold gray dawn at length broke over the coast, and with its first glimmer Barnard North flung himself from his bed and put on his rugged garments, while a weak, nervous stupor for a few moments sealed the senses of his wife. But a brief space elapsed before he had traversed the few yards of causeway and stood on the bluff overlooking the sea and the beach. 
               Certainly there was that in the sight which might have shaken even a stouter heart than the Wrecker's, could we believe it possible that such a heart existed. If there had seemed to be any possibility of the storm increasing from the force it had displayed the night before, it appeared now to be indeed beyond addition to its violence. The wind had swelled from an ordinary gale to be one of those fearful and long continued tempests which scarcely rage in our Northern latitudes more than twice in a century. It hissed through the air with a sound like that of a whistling bullet, blended with a wild sad moan above-the air actually producing sound by concussion with itself! The sea, lashed to fury by the gale that had now held on for so many hours, was one boiling, seething cauldron, in which anything of life seemed to have no more chance of preservation than it would had found in the wildest rapids of Niagara-in which any fabric of wood and iron fashioned and bound by the strongest hand of man must have parted like reeds or rushes. It broke on the beach with a sound of smothered thunder-the fierce sheet leaping and surging to the very top of the causeway and casting its spray a hundred feet over it-further than any man living had ever before seen it breaking, since the settlement of the coast. 
               But not in the sea and of it was the saddest sight that met the troubled eye of the Wrecker. Seaward in front of him, a quarter of a mile above and below him, whirling and dashing to and from the beach-scarce one fragment remaining by another,-were the planks and timbers of a large vessel-the broken stumps of her masts with the rigging still attached and the marks of the axe at the foot telling too well the efforts that the perishing crew had so vainly made for their lives. 
               And this was not all or by any means the worst. Mingled with the whirling fragments and dashing up with them to the beach, were several human bodies, crushed and mutilated by the broken timber, the dark clothes of the men and the light floating dress of a single female presenting a painful contrast at the first glance cast upon the scene of destruction. That death-shriek had been no imaginary one; and the Wrecker closed his eyes and pressed his hands against his ears, for again he seemed to hear it as he had heard it in the long dismal watches of the night. 
               It was now broad morning, and some of the hardiest of the fishermen from the village had arrived upon the beach. With them, too, Robert North, the eldest son of the Wrecker, had come down from the house and stood among the shoremen on the beach, his young eyes full of pity which might have been born in the face of a commiserating angel. Blue eyed and brown haired, pleasant faced, and his form already beginning to give promise of the stalwart strength so prominent in his father, he seemed almost a handsome miniature of him as he stood-the resemblance rendered more striking by the similarity in cut and appearance of the clothing worn by each. More than one of the shoremen, even in the storm of that morning and with such a scene of death compelling every thought, found time to glance at the handsome and promising boy who seemed so full of feeling for the dead and so active at assisting in their removal,-and to think how surely in the days to come he would even eclipse the fame of his father and become the very pride of the coast. 
               Long and dangerous was the effort by which half a dozen of the bodies were extracted from the surf and the broken timbers, and carried up to the little out-house behind the cottage, where they were left for examination by the Coroner and burial when the storm should abate. There Rachael North and her daughter performed for the women, and the rough but kindly hands of the shoremen for the men the last offices for the time; and the bodies were left alone to await the after duties already indicated. 
               Still the storm increased. There was less of rain, so that the danger and desolation sea ward could be more readily distinguished; but the gale, which had long before reached what seemed to be the culmination of all possibility, yet grew heavier by the hour. The "Lent Legends" had not then been written, and if they had been, the limited reading of the dwellers by the sea would scarcely have made them familiar with the lore of the West Coast of England there embodied; but thinking to-day of that terrible storm on the Seaboard shore, one cannot but be reminded of the fearful records of that time when the very demons of the storm seemed to have been unloosed to desolate the mother land-when men grew weak-nerved and women fell praying under the belief that the great day of God's wrath had come at last-when the Bishop of Bath and Wells lay moaning under the ruins of his fallen palace, when Sir Cloudesley Shovel's fleet was grinding to pieces on the Scilly Rocks, and when Winstanley plunged into a fearful death amid the ruins of that Eddystone Light-house which he had just builded with such arrogant boasting. In such hours it is no difficult matter to believe that nature has really returned to chaos, and that no power can avail to stay the great catastrophe. The stout shoremen of Topsail stood awe-struck on the causeway, when they had finished their sad work-stood to listen to sounds new even to the oldest and the hardiest. That sad moaning in the air, which has been already feebly described, had increased until it was one deep and terrible wail, almost stunning the ears and suggesting that these must be, indeed, the voices of friends howling in joy over the work of the storm. Seaward the white aspect of the water was gone, and the black waves seemed almost blown down to a level by the action of the gale. The stout bare poles on which the fishermen suspended their lines and nets to dry, bent like whip-stocks; and those who stood near enough to the cottage of Barnard North saw that ever and anon the sides of stout joists and thick clapboards were dashed in and sucked out again by the action of the wind, as if they had been nothing but pasteboard. To guard against much milder gales, the house had been secured by piles driven deep into the clay causeway and heavily pinned to the foundations, or it seemed that it might have been swept upward like a feather. But language fails to describe the sights and sounds of such an hour; those who have passed through similar scenes must after all supply most of the picture from imagination, and those who have escaped can never be brought to believe in the whole terrible reality. 
               "It thickens every moment," said one of the gray-headed and rough-coated old fisherman." In forty years here I have seen nothing like it!" 
               "It is past nateral-this here storm," replied one of the younger men, shivering at the thought as if with cold. "I do believe that there is something in the yelling of that wind, that nobody ever heard before, and that'll never be heard again; till the whole earth's blown away like a rotten foresail." 
               Shoremen are naturally as superstitious as their brothers of the blue water; and this desponding remark of a man whose heart fainted before the eternal and the incomprehensible while he would have thrown away his life like a worthless reed in the next moment on any merely human venture,-was responded to by another, older but almost as deeply affected, who said: 
               "Think so, Ned? well, I don't know but this may be the cend. It is comin' sometime they say: may be it has come to-day, and that the trumpet's blowin' in that are very sound!" 
               "I wish I'd gone to meetin' the other night when Sall wanted me to, 'stead o' goin' down to Gil Davis's!" was the reply of yet another, who thus betrayed, unwittingly, the secrets of two lives. 
               "Pshaw, mates!-there is no voice there that has not been heard many a time before, though mayhap it don't speak out that way in these high latitudes!" broke in an old bronzed and weather-beaten sailor, not long home on a visit from his last cruise in the Indian Ocean. "I've heard that scream so often that it seems as nateral as the bo's'n pipin' down to breakfast! You should weather one typhoon or an old cycloner in the Chiny seas, mates, as I did only last November, and you'd never be talkin' about goin' to meetin' and forgetin' the number of your mess, for such a cat-call as this!" 
               The old sailor spoke a little in bravado, as is not unfrequently the habit of men who have dared much and experienced more; but there was something reassuring in his words even to the hardiest who had not passed through similar perils; and perhaps there was not one present but felt a little stouter hearted when he had concluded. 
               "You are right," said Barnard North. "There is no wind blowing here that has not blown before, and no wind that is not guided by a Hand capable of managing it. But His judgments are terrible! would to heaven that I could have done something to save these perished people!" 
               "You could not-nobody could!" said one of the others. 
               "Of course not-I am glad you think as I do," rejoined the Wrecker. "It would have been horrible, wouldn't it, if any of us could have heard these poor fellows scream, and been too much discouraged or too careless to go out and try to take them off?" 
               No one marked his face as he said this; had any one done so, there might have been discovered something there, not ordinarily to be seen in the bold, frank face-an expression of shame nearly approaching guilt, and needing but little deepening to become agony. 
               "Why, how queerly you talk, Barney North!" said one of the shoremen. "No man on the coast has so little right as yourself to say what you have just said. Haven't you always done all that man could do, and a great deal more than any other man would be likely to do, I should like to know? Hasn't he, boys?" 
               "Aye! aye! aye! What is he grumbling about?" came from so many lips wet with the driving seud of the south-easter, that the Wrecker needed no other testimony of his standing among the shoremen of Topsail. 
               "I am glad to hear you say so! I shall sleep the better for it to night!" he said, grasping the hand of the principal speaker with a nervous action which did not seem to be demanded by anything that had occurred. 
               "Thank God that there are no more vessels in sight!" said one of the men, who had been sweeping the horizon as well as possible, through a pocket-glass. "One wreck ought to be enough for Topsail beach to-day, and there is nothing afloat that could keep an offing in this wind." 
               "Come-let us get these wet clothes changed, and a drop of whiskey to keep the cold from striking in," replied another, shaking himself like a water-dog. "Home is the word-there is nothing more to do here until the storm lets up." Others followed the suggestion and the movement, and took their way back towards the village of Topsail. Eyes keener than ours and judgements better than ours must decide whether all then present would have done so as readily, had the beach been strewn with something more valuable than broken planks, spars and timber-had not the experienced eyes of the wreckers told them that the ill-fated vessel had either been in ballast or loaded with iron or some other ponderous freight, that went to the bottom at once when she drove to pieces! Enough to say that the beach because for the time deserted, and that Barnard North and his son re-entered the little cottage that stood shivering under the gale, where most of the members of the family strove to drown in conversation and in-door labor the memory of the storm without and the victims of its violence that lay so near them. But neither those memories or others yet more painful were drowned in the bosoms of the Wrecker and his wife-the one pretending to read, but in a few moments dropping his head upon his hands as if painful thought completely over mastered him, and the other ever and anon looking furtively up from the mechanical labour followed by her fingers, to see a black shadow on her husband's brow, which threw a corresponding gloom upon her anxious and foreboding heart. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               THE COMING OF THE DOOMED SHIP. 
               SO passed an hour or two in the outer or back room of the Wrecker's dwelling, where all the family were assembled. The occupation of Rachael North, and the want of occupation of her husband, (except mental). have already been indicated. Pretty and fragile little Charlotte was imitating and assisting her mother, more or less, in the use of her needle; young Barnard and William, two fine, frank, hearty boys, the elder dark eyed like his mother, and browner faced than any other member of the family, and the younger blue eyed and brown haired like his father, were trying to while away the time that confined them within doors and so made them comparatively miserable, with innumerable games of draughts or checkers, played upon a board of the rudest domestic manufacture, with black and white bone buttons for pieces; while Robert, who hoped to live to become a boat-builder, was developing his mechanical genius and his talent for modeling, by shaping from a block of soft pine with his jack-knife, a coasting schooner of twelve inches, destined to outsail all the other craft of her size in the Wreck Pond, which lay half a mile back from the sea, below and under the edge of the Topsail woods. Yet all these occupations were conducted in comparative silence; for over all, younger as well as older, hung something of that indefinable feeling of evil which impregnated the whole atmosphere. 
               There had been little appetite for breakfast that morning, with the wreck on the beach, and the painful work to be done of taking up the corpses. But as it drew towards noon, habit asserted its away, if appetite gave little warning; and Rachael North arose from her work, drew out the plain pine table from its place by the wall, covered it with a cloth that if not "snowy," was near enough for neatness to that favorite adjective of romancers, when speaking of the table-cloths of cottage life,-and spread thereon the not unsavory pottage, which had been bubbling in its kettle over the fire, while it dried the clothes of father and son and supplied warmth against the chill of the September storm. Then the little circle, at a sign from the housewife, surrounded the table, though still in silence, and still with every thought merged in the storm-wind that roared around the house, and the threatening view that met the eye from the windows. They ate in silence, such of them as could eat at all-poor Rachael North felt every mouthful choking her, and at last gave up the attempt in despair. Why this was, not one of them could know, any more than they could know why the wind blew more fiercely that day than it had done in forty years before, or why the sailors on the wrecked ship of the night before had been allowed to perish in the darkness and come to be lying stark in the outhouse, waiting for their burial. There was a guest at table for whom a plate and chair had not been set-one whose influence they felt, though they did not see his form, or know of his presence-the Scythian Guest, whose staring eyes look down the long line of revellers at the board, where he has sat so many times in life, but who tastes not the viands, nor hears the loud pealing of the music, nor even recognises the faces of his old companions. The guest at so many tables to which he has not been invited by the banqueters-Death! 
               Even that meal was not to be concluded in peace. Twice the Wrecker's son, in obedience to a sign from his father, and not less, it is probable, from his own anxiety, rose and went to the window that overlooked the sea. From his first quest he came back with a simple shake of the head and resumed his place at the table; but when he rose and looked a second time, Barnard North saw him dash his face close to the wet and thickened glass, and scarcely needed his quick and anxious cry; 
               "Look! there is a ship coming on!" 
               Barnard north sprung suddenly from the table and leaped to the window. Behind and around him, with quite as sudden motions, gathered his family, leaving the table deserted and unthought of. It was as Robert had indicated by his cry-just emerging from the partial mist and rain seaward came a large ship, driving helplessly before the gale, only a rag of canvas showing and the rest evidently blown away,-laboring heavily, and driving on to a destruction apparently as certain as if she had already struck and broken up. 
               "My God!" shouted the Wrecker, "she is not a mile from the bar, and ten minutes hence no human power can save her, even if it is not already too late! I was sure that this fearful day could not close without more dead bodies strewing the Topsail beach! I was sure of it!-I knew it!" 
               Scarcely a moment had elapsed when the Wrecker and his oldest son stood on the causeway overlooking the sea, while the other members of his family crowded without the door or gazed in terror through the windows at the destruction which was so evidently approaching. Young Robert North, as he stood on the causeway by his father's side on that fatal day, the rough wind singing through the curls of his brown hair, his stout form wrapped in a thick short coat, and a low round sailor hat on his head,-seemed even more forcibly than he had done in the earlier morning the very ideal of the "sailor boy" who has since grown so popular in "Black-Eyed Susan" and a hundred other dramas: and the eye of the Wrecker glanced proudly upon him as he stood at his side, spite of the sinking of the heart within and the painful and threatening view seaward. 
               "She must go on the Point!" said the boy, clasping his hands in woful interest. "Look!-the white breakers are just ahead of her, now!" 
               "They are farther away from her than you think, my son," answered the Wrecker, measuring the distance with a practised eye. "She has sea-room yet, if enough sail could be started to forge her past the Point. But it cannot be!" he added, sadly, after the pause of a moment. "Her sails are all blown away, or there is no hand left to set them. Ha!" and the eye of the anxious man brightened with genuine pleasure as he saw a white cloud of canvas gleam for a moment between the foremast and the mainmast. "They are trying to set a mainsail on her, after all! God help them to do it, for it is their only hope. If they can make that hold for only a minute or two she may claw off enough to pass the Point without striking, and then there will be a good chance for life in the mouth of the Inlet." 
               The effort that Barnard North had been so quick to recognise was indeed being made, and as the father and son watched with straining eyes it seemed that it might be a successful one. Oh, could that canvas but hold! could the human hands that had so much cause to depends upon it, but find strength enough even to set it! Little by little the watchers saw it labors out towards the ends of the yards; and as the wind fairly caught it they saw it flap and belly with the strain, and the black side of the ship sank almost out of sight as she bent down under the pressure. Lower-lower-it seemed that she must capsize, as she must indeed have done if she had failed to gather way; but in a moment after, her dull side-motion and helpless laboring roll began to change, and lying almost on her side she surged heavily forward. 
               "Ah, they are gallant fellows!" shouted Barnard North, wringing his hands in the very impossibility of using them in aid of the perilled men. "The men who can haul out that sail under this wind deserve to escape, and if it can hold for only two or three minutes they will have a chance for their lives!" 
               And the agitation of the old shoreman at that moment was nothing to excite wonder, however little he knew of the persons who were thus making a last brave effort for life. For scarcely even the death-bed of a loved one is a harder thing to witness than the doubtful struggle for life or success of some one who deserves to achieve it as a reward for skill, indomitable energy or reckless bravery. It is but little to see any man perish, when he has shown no nerve from the beginning; as his destruction, in any circumstance of serious peril, is from the first a foregone conclusion. It is only a little pitiable to see a frightened wretch screaming for aid when no aid can be afforded, and drowning without making one effort to keep himself above water; but, oh, it is agony hard to endure to see a brave, strong swimmer striking out through a blinding surf or against an arrow current-to watch, and hope, and fear, and embrace the struggler in spirit, and wring hands that cannot aid him, and utter prayers that have no faith to give them wings, and see him on the very verge of safety, and believe him safe enough to demand a shout of thanksgiving, and then to see the tired arms go up in one last three of despair, and the waters close about that head that shall find no pillow again except the cool white sands at the bottom! Something of this was what Barnard North was feeling, that day on the Topsail beach, when the men on the doomed ship were making that last brave but almost hopeless effort, and thus battling fate to the end! 
               For a moment she gathered way under that pressure, and then they lost sight of her. A sudden dash of rain, with a gust so severe that it turned the sea before them to almost inky blackness, hid her entirely from view. So violent was that outpouring of the stormbreath that only the strongest bracing of the nerves of the watchers prevented their being swept entirely away from the causeway. 
               "That seals their fate!" said the Wrecker, his hands this time wrung in despair as they had before been in anxiety. "That main- sail has blown away like so many ribbons, for there is not a bit of canvas in the world that can stand that!" 
               When the scud drove away, as it partially did only a moment after, it was too fearfully apparent that the despairing words of the Wrecker were the truth of a prophecy. They had seen her two minutes before, with a faint hope of safety-faint indeed, but still a hope. They saw her now with that last hope gone. The heavy sail had been rent into shreds from the bolt-ropes, and was flying from her yards like the very ribbons to which Barnard North had so lately compared it; and the ship herself, losing her way, was driving helplessly upon the bar, the white foam flashing almost underneath her lee. 
               "God help them now!" said Barnard North, "that was their last chance! Oh, for a boat that could live in the sea, and three pairs of arms as stout as mine! They should not all perish, or they should have a few more to drown with them!" 
               "Look! look! she strikes!" shouted or almost shrieked the boy, as he saw the lost vessel, ceasing from the deadly roll that had struck her since she neared the bar, leap almost directly upright and settle on an even keel with a shock that sent the shiver to the very tops of her masts. "Oh, father, look! she rolls over!" 
               "I see her, my son," groaned the Wrecker. "Such a sight as I have seen too many times before, when human help could avail nothing. She has struck, indeed. Now if she will but roll inboard as she settles, there may be an hour of life for some of the poor fellows, and who knows but we may be able to save some of them? but if she rolls seaward, Heaven's mercy cannot spare them a moment!" 
               Well might young Robert North close his eyes and shut his hands over them the instant after, and the stalwart frame of his father quiver with uncontrollable emotion. For as the swell upon which the ship came in went back, they saw the black side to leeward heave out almost to the keel as she rolled outboard; and the instant following, as the next wave came bursting in and swept her deck, over her lee bulwarks dashed a dark mass of men, as so many sheep might have been seen leaping in disorder over an enclosure when chased by a ravening dog-dashed over, not of their own will but swept by the fierce besom of the wave, and were seen struggling helplessly in the mad water. Even at that distance their single dark forms could be distinguished amid the white curl of the breakers on the bar, and it was easy to believe that the gazers saw the very strokes with which they fought the blinding and whelming death; but this was uncertain, only one thing was known and that was known but too well-that fifty or a hundred human bodies were perishing there without hope of succor-that fifty or a hundred human souls were going to their last account without other immediate preparation than could have been made with the storm wind in their ears, and words of fear and blasphemy drowning every chance of thought or devotion! 
               "Not one of those men will ever reach the shore!" cried Barnard North, wringing those hard, strong hands. "They must die like drowning dogs, with no hand outstretched to save them. Oh, this must not be-shall not be! Run, Robert, hurry to the village! Tell Decker and Lewis and Radstock to hurry to the beach and bring all the other good men they can find, and we will try-. No, it is too late for that-she will break up long before you could even get there. Oh God, that they had not all gone home like a set of fair-weather cowards!-that I had only two, only one, to go off with me! There should be some lives saved off that ship, or I would lose my own in trying for it!" 
               "Go, then!" said the noble boy, starting suddenly forward. "I cannot pull an oar with you, father; but though I may be very little and only a boy, there are very few others from whom I would ask one light stroke!" 
               "You!" cried the Wrecker, turning on him a glance in which pride struggled with surprise. "No, no, boy!-your young life must not be perilled yet. Wait until your time comes, and then, when you are a man, with a man's sinews and judgment, fulfil your duty, so far as you can see it, on Topsail beach or elsewhere, and trust God for the oversight." 
               "My time is now!" answered the boy, speaking with a propriety and energy beyond his years and education-inspired, no doubt, by that same feeling which becomes heroism under the sheet of the Great Fall or on the most perilous precipices of the mountains. "My time is now-now when there is danger to be met and my father needs my arm. Try me, father, and see what I can do." 
               "Your mother, boy?" asked Barnard North, in whose mind all other thoughts were rapidly giving way before the overmastering desire to render some aid to the perishing, but who could not quite forget, even in that moment, the wife of his love, the home that might so easily be rendered desolate, and the sad omens of sorrow and loss which had made miserable the previous night to both. "Your mother, my boy, would not consent; and if she would, I dare not." 
               "Do not ask her," answered Robert North. "I know that she would be afraid of my going off; but she is not a man, you know father, and only men know about these things. We shall be safe enough-come!" 
               "Safe, my boy?" said the father, looking on his son with a pride which almost conquered the trembling agony of love. "Safe? Yes, safe as men might be under the mouths of a row of cannon just ready to belch, or sitting on a barrel of gunpowder with the fire creeping up to it! No, boy, you do not know the peril, or you would never have tempted me in this manner." 
               "I do know the peril, and I dare it!" almost shouted the boy. "See, those men are drowning, and we are doing nothing to help them. You are going off, and so am I! Come, father, the boat!" How his blue eyes lightened as he spoke!-how the bold blood of the Norse Vikings told in every word and gesture!-how certainly he, placed in the situation of the "boy who stood on the burning deck," at the battle of the Nile, would have stood there like him, or like the heroic youngster of the bursted dyke in the Netherlands, kept his finger in the hole that shut out ruin from a great city, until he lay frozen and dead at his post of honor! Robert North was right, though it may not have been given to human eyes to see that he was so. Our lives are not to be measured by days or years, or even by centuries, but by what we have done, and what we have felt-by the mountain peaks of duty that are recognised, and reached, and climbed, or by the failures made in either. Men have lived, grown gray and died, leaving children to bless their memories, and praises from other men to be recorded on their tombstones,-not half so ripe at the hour of their departure, as was this gallant boy of seventeen, on the day when he found his opportunity of heroism and sprang to meet it with a cry! 
               "God wills it so!" said the Wrecker, muttering to himself, with the same feeling, but a different thought from that which sent old Tanered of Tarent thundering over Askalon with "Deus vult!" on his banner. "I cannot tell what is to be the event. It may be superhuman success that will make the names of the shoremen ring further than they have ever been heard-it may be a terrible bereavement to Rachael North, and two funerals without even a body in Poplar graveyard-only God in heaven knows! Come, boy," he added, "you shall indeed begin to be a man to-day. To the boat!" 
               The Wrecker and his son flew up the causeway, to the spot where fifty yards beyond lay the light surf-boat that had been launched in so many a storm. As they grasped prow and stern, and prepared to run it shoreward, they looked again at the doomed ship, and, if they could have hesitated before, hesitation was no longer possible. Even as they looked they saw the mainmast go over the side, and knew that there were living men remaining on board, seizing the last feeble chances of life. 
               All possible peril was forgotten, now when it became so evident that the venture was not to be made entirely in the dark; and with firm and steady hands the Wrecker and his son dragged the little surf-boat onward to the doubtful trial. A few moments more and they would have been breasting that terrible surf for death or triumph. But their movements had been observed from the cottage, as they should have known that they would be; and before their sturdy arms had drawn the boat one half the distance towards the beach, voices were heard up the causeway, then a women's shriek followed, and regardless of the storm Rachael North and her remaining children flew down to the spot where the rash attempt was being made. Young Robert did not see or hear, so intent was he upon the first great work of his life; but the Wrecker saw and paused, while the fierce excitement of coming danger died out from his face, and the sad, troubled expression again came back to it. 
               "Why are you here in the rain and wind, Rachael?" he asked, adding: "This is no place for you, woman, or for the children." 
               "Husband, husband, what are you attempting to do?" cried the terrified woman, who knew but too well, without the question, that her husband had determined to launch his boat, for life or death,-and who should have known that when once his mind was made up to what he believed to be a line of duty, not much less could check him than would be needed to fetter mad wind and madder wave. 
               "Do you see that ship, heating to pieces on the bar, and know that there are perishing men on board of her, and then ask me that question?" was the query in reply, as the Wrecker, with the assistance of his willing son, again forced the boat onward. "I am going off to her, if God spares my life from this beach." 
               "You are mad!" cried the half-distracted wife, seizing him by the arm. "Barnard, you know that no boat can live in this sea. If you would not rush in the face of the very God you name, leave that boat where it is, and do not think of such a thing!" 
               "I cannot stop," answered the Wrecker, without releasing his hold upon the boat, though pausing in his work of drawing it forward. "What would you make of me, Rachael North-a miserable coward if not a murderer? Do you remember that wild scream of last night, that you tried to make yourself and me believe was only the howling of the wind? Would you have more dead lying in the out-house yonder, as so many ghastly bodies are lying at this moment-and know that there might have been less of them if your husband had done his duty? I would not pass another such night as the last, for ten lives, and you would not if you are the true woman I have always believed you." 
               "Barnard North, listen to me!" said the agonized wife, still keeping her hold upon his arm. 
               "Not if you are going to coax me away from my duty!" answered the Wrecker. 
                
               "Barnard North," repeated the wife, twining both her arms around his as if she could physically hold him away from his fate-"Barnard North, do listen to me, if you do not wish to throw away your own life as guiltily as if you put a knife to your throat. It is madness to launch that boat at all, today; but if you think more of the people yonder, whom you have never seen, than you do of us, do not make the attempt alone! Call help, for the love of heaven, if you will do nothing else to keep me from losing my senses!" 
               "I have help-I am not alone," answered the Wrecker. 
               "Not alone? I see no one! Where-where is your help?" almost shrieked Rachael North, with a terrible trouble upon her face. 
               "There," said Barnard North, pointing to his son. 
               "There!" and the word was spoken as if the mind did not quite comprehend its utterance. 
               "Yes, there!" repeated the Wrecker. "Robert desires to become a man this day, and I have promised him that he shall do so." 
               "Your son-my son!" shrieked the mother, recoiling as if her husband had struck her instead of merely smiting her with his words. "Barnard North, take back what you have said. You would not drown that boy, even for your wild notions of duty!" 
               "Wife!" spoke the Wrecker, and his voice trembled in spite of himself-"do not unnerve me or make yourself more miserable than you need to be. There stands the boy-your son and mine-no more belonging to the one than the other. You love him, so do I-that is, at least I think I do. I should not like to see him lying, drowned on the sand here, any more than you; and I would not put his life in danger, of my own will, even to save my own soul. But he has seen the need of something being done for those poor fellows, he has asked my leave to aid me in trying to save them, and I have given it. Ask him: if he wishes to stay he shall do so; if he wishes to go off with me he shall go." 
               "Oh Robert, oh my own son!" cried the distracted woman, clasping her arm about him, her hair dishevelled and flying loose in the fierce wind, while the remaining three children, who had all followed, stood silent and frightened but a little way behind. "Oh Robert, my son-my first-born-do not go away and leave me! Do not break your poor mother's heart and let yourself be drowned! Say that you will not go away and leave me, my son-my son!" 
               "I cannot say so, mother!" said the noble boy, thus perhaps for the first time in his life driven to disobedience to the pleading of a mother, and too much agitated even to return her agonized caress. "I have asked my father's consent to go with him, because he must go and he shall not go alone. I am not a child, mother-I am a man! Don't cry and hold me fast; we shall soon come back and bring human lives with us-never fear!" 
               "Oh my Father in Heaven!-he does not heed me-he will not obey me-he will be lost!" cried the wretched woman, falling upon her knees on the wet ground and lifting up her hands despairingly to Heaven. "Barnard North, once more I ask you to have pity on this boy and on me, if you have none for yourself!" 
               "I love you both, but I have pity on those who are perishing yonder," answered the stout Wrecker, his face full of trouble and yet displaying a stony hardness which augured ill for any person attempting to turn him from his purpose. Then he went on: "Rachael, go back to the cottage, and take your children out of this storm. You have faith in God, if I lack what my mother's teachings should have given me: pray for us, as you have never prayed before, for we have a desperate deed to do and we are going to do it or make food for the man-eaters in trying. Robert, my boy, come-we can delay no longer. Look!-there goes another mast!" and at the moment they indeed saw the foremast of the ship topple over and fall crashing to leeward. "She cannot hold together half an hour longer, and what is to be done must be done at once!" he concluded; and without another word to the other members of the family, father and son re-applied themselves to their work and dragged on the boat. 
               Rachael North did not rise from her knees. She was too much stupefied with her heavy fear and the shadow of what she believed to be a coming grief, to speak more at that moment; and with her remaining children grouped around her she gazed in helpless agony at the spectacle of her husband and her first-born rushing into what she felt to be certain death. The two remaining boys, too young fully to realize all the danger, stood speechless but unmoved at her side; and Charlotte, weak and nervous, sobbing and terrified, clasped her little arms around the one parent left her, as if she feared being parted even from her. The wild sea that broke close beside them, scattering its spray over their very heads-the fierce wind that seemed ready at any moment to lift them from their feet and dash them away landward-the driving rain that was fast penetrating through their coarse garments and chilling them to the very life blood,-all were unheeded then: there was a more terrible storm raging within the breast of Rachael North than ever wrecked vessel or desolated coast-the storm of a mother's grief and fear! 
               "Rachael North! wife!" shouted the hoarse voice of the Wrecker as he stood be- side his boat at the verge of the beach, ready to make that perilous attempt at launching-"for your children's sake, if not for your own, do not stay longer in this storm where you can do no good! go home." 
               "Home! home!" murmured the distracted wife, rising mechanically at the bidding of a voice which she had not been accustomed to disregard-"home!-what will my home be in an hour. Husband and son both gone to their death! Oh, God, spare them to me who need them so much!-spare my husband to the children who would be fatherless!-spare them for Thy mercy's sake!" 
               Never had even Barnard North, the very monarch of danger and exposure, attempted to launch his boat in such a terrible sea and at such deadly peril. Gold, piled in thousands before him, would not have tempted him for one moment: duty, duty only, as he deemed, drove him on. Half a score of times, nobly seconded by the brave boy whose nerve and strength seemed altogether beyond his years, he attempted to launch through the boiling surf at some favorable moment, between the ever-recurring "tenth wave," but as often found himself beaten back to the beach. Three times they had been on the very verge of being crushed to death by their boat as she was thrown back by the surf, and yet they persevered. One more struggle and they won. With almost superhuman skill and speed Rachael North saw them at last drive the frail boat from the beach, spring into her, seize their oars and dash the tough ashen blades into the foaming brine. A terrible sea struck the little boat at the moment, but it struck her full in the bow, the strong arms bent to the oars, for an instant again she stood so nearly upright that it seemed she must be hurled backward to the beach, then she rose astern as the wave dashed shoreward under her, and the next moment they were clear of the sand, breasting such a sea as seldom boat had lived in since the first surf-boat was launched by iron hands, but the great danger of the first adventure over. 
               Then Rachael North took her way back to the cottage with her children. She looked back as she went, and saw that the ship yet held together, though all her spars were gone now and she could endure the mad beat of the Titan sledge-hammer waves but little longer; she saw the tall form of her husband and the shorter figure of the boy-her boy!-in that deadly peril. Sick at heart she entered her desolate home, poor little Charlotte weeping in sympathy, and the boys whimpering a little because both mother and sister were crying. They probably thought it rather a fine thing than otherwise for Robert, to be reckoned so near a man as to pull an oar with his father; and then they shared the blood of the shoreman and knew but little of the meaning of the word danger. But the mother-oh, the mother, conjoined and intensified with the wife! She could no longer see the boat from the window, through the thick gathering mist and rain; yet it had gone out from her line of vision only as husband and son seemed to have gone from her life. It might yet be speeding away on its dangerous errand: it might be already tossing like a cockle-shell upon the surface of the water, with both its dear and valued lives perished,-who could say? 
               With her children sobbing around her in a strange fear which they scarcely realized, the wife and mother threw herself upon her knees, her forehead resting against the cold pane on which was beating the storm of her loved ones peril-and prayed. 
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
               SAVED AND LOST. 
               OLD and experienced as was Barnard North in the perils of sea and shore-even he had scarcely anticipated the hopelessness of the struggle which he and his brave boy had begun. Could it be of any avail, after all?-the thought rapidly glanced through his mind and produced a momentary sickening sensation there, though it did not unsteady one nerve that grasped the ashen oar-could the little boat possibly live to reach the ship?-and if she did would there be one alive to receive her aid?-and in the terrible sea on the bar could even one be taken on board such a mere shell upon the waves as that little boat, without ensuring the destruction of all? But what matter?-this, too, the noble Wrecker asked himself, what matter for the real issue of the adventure? What he held to be duty, even if it involved the sacrifice of his own life, must be done unflinchingly, and the rest left to God! Such was the spirit with which the martyrs had followed their worship in defiance of the edicts of kings and councils, and gone to the stake as the penalty. Such was the spirit with which the patriots of old had defiance the threats of tyrants and scorned their blandishments, herding in the mountains and suffering cold, hunger, and every privation, until death closed or victory crowned their efforts. Why should not a descendant of the men who had landed on Plymouth Rock and planted a colony in the midst of savage red-men and a howling wilderness, all for the sake of conscience and duty-why should not he be found risking death or a bereavement to which death would be a mercy, when called by the cries of those who were ready to perish? 
               Was his boy afraid? Did he blench now-now when the full extent of the danger was revealed to him? Barnard North pulled the bow-oar, and could look upon his gallant boy, unseen by him. Afraid? No! He could see that every nerve was bent to its utmost tension, and that his plump young hands held the oar with a grasp that had in it nothing of fear. He could not see his face, but he saw the floating of his brown hair in the gale and imagined the rest. It may seem strange, to the uninitiated, that Barnard North saw all this and thought of all this in that moment of fearful peril; but the man who has been worried by some defect in the architectural adornments of the inside of a church while the funeral sermon of the one dearest to him in life was being pronounced-or that other man who has studied dynamics and calculated the amount of resistance that would be given to the cars by his own body, at the moment when he supposed himself about to be crushed into a horrible death under the wheels of a flying railroad-train,-either of these will understand how the mind can trifle with an idle side fancy at the very instant when one absorbing thought might be supposed to monopolize all sensation. Besides, Barnard North's own hold upon the oar was as mechanical as the movements of the fingers of the woman who has been knitting all her life; and he had eyes and thought-that proud, doting father-for the least detail that concerned his boy. 
               Not a word was spoken as they gained an offing from the beach, and swept onwards beyond the surf, towards the perishing ship. In the howl of the wind and the hoarse roar of the waves, even at the three feet which separated them they would have been obliged to make themselves heard by a shout. Once Robert North, overcome by his anxiety to know the progress of events on the doomed ship, gave one quick glance over his shoulder; but he scarcely caught a glimpse before the hoarse voice of his father sounded out like a trumpet hail. 
               "Your oar! mind your oar, boy, for your life!-for your mother's life, boy!" and he bent again to his work, obediently and determinedly, as if he had been rowing a holiday race over a summer sea, with a purse and a bunch of red ribbons as the prize, instead of human life. 
               Again fell silence, only broken by that fearful howling in the air, as they crossed the remaining space intervening between the shore and the bar. The little boat went down into the hollow of the waves, and seemed buried for the last time beneath the whelming waters. Then she rose again, and seemed tossed like a cork on the very topmost crest of the wave, as if she must be hurled like a rocket skyward. But aloft or buried, still the tough ashen blades kept their stroke with never a miss, and never the faltering of a nerve; and the water that threatened to swamp them was beaten away, and only broke over them in the blinding spray driven by the sea-wind. Bent ever a noble pair than the father and his son, to the oar of boat built by human hands, on any errand of mercy? 
               They were nearing the bar, and the wrecked vessel. They could hear the screams and the wails of those on board, with occasionally a shout of joy, as one would recognise the little boat, and know that it was making towards them-faint hope for the life perhaps of one! 
               They were now in the white water of the bar, and in rapidly increasing danger. Broken seas came sweeping over them, half deluging their boat, and needing every nerve, and the most consummate skill, to prevent her being submerged for the last time. But that nerve and that skill were there, and neither faltering. They had approached very near the perishing ship-not more than a hundred yards to leeward, and in obedience to the quick, sharp word of Barnard North, pulling away a point to the westward, to avoid some of the broken spars that might else have dashed them to pieces,-when the Wrecker turned his head for an instant full upon the ship, and met there a sight that might for many a year have haunted the mind of a man more feeble in body or less accustomed to life on the coast. A terrible scene even to him-unendurably terrible to one who has never before beheld its parallel. Happy those who have been spared a spectacle capable of matching in horror the ghastliest wind-row of the battle-field; thrice happy they who hold the privilege of going to their peaceful graves without ever having a corresponding terror imprinted upon the ductile leaves of memory! 
               Twenty or thirty of those who yet survived were clinging to the bulwarks of what had evidently been a very large ship, battered and discolored by a long voyage, and apparently an East-Indiaman. The last mast had gone some time before; the bulwarks were broken and splintered; the deck-houses were carried away; and there had already occurred to the vessel that sinking of the bow and stern and upheaving amidships, destroying all the lines of symmetry and indicating that "breaking up" which, when once begun continues with the celerity of an unravelling thread. And oh, with what a grasp of death those poor wretches clung to those splintered bulwarks, and how their white faces of fear glared out through the thick air with as fearful a distinctness as if they had been not more than a yard away from the observer! How each seemed to be stretching a hand for succor, even when no such physical act was really performed, but both holding on to timber or rope with the tenacious grasp of despair! How each strained face and starting eye seemed to say, in tones more distinguishable than their white lips could utter: "What have we done, to be thus cast out from help by God and the elements? Why do you not help us? Will nobody come to save us from this death that is so sudden and so cruel?" 
               The practised eye of the Wrecker took in at a glance the whole extent and imminence of their peril-the certainty that within the next moment all on board must be beyond the reach of any succor. He saw that every scam of the doomed ship gaped wide-that every timber was so rent from that to which it had been bolted and tree-nailed, that the next tenth wave must sweep all into broken fragments. 
               Even as he looked he saw the catastrophe. The tenth wave came, higher and fiercer than those which had preceded and must follow it, as is the master passion in the human heart stronger and more wildly resolute than all its companions conjoined. Half the wave spent its force in lifting the ship almost clear from her position and throwing her down again shivered on the sand, as a child might have dashed down its discredited toy. The secondary force of its mighty energy struck her full in the shattered side, with a weight and fury that seemed demoniac, and hurled her into a thousand pieces of broken planks and timber, with a struggling, screaming, drowning mass of humanity whirled and buried within and beneath it. 
               Even the stout heart of Barnard North stood almost still at the sight. But deadly peril to himself and his son was involved. One instant more, and they would be whirled in the midst of those broken timbers and dashed to pieces without a hope. 
               "Pull for your life, boy, pull!" he shouted, through his clenched teeth. "That last sea knocked her to bits, and here she comes! The broken timbers will catch us in a moment. Pull, steady and strong! We must work to windward, boy, or your mother will have neither son nor husband." 
               Steady and strong indeed was the pull, both of father and son. Both equally realized the danger and the necessity. But the peril was more fearful than either imagined. As the ship was swept into atoms, the lee which she had formed for the approach of the boat existed no longer, and, full in the teeth of the wind and gale, they could make no progress. And it was during that anxious moment that, spite of the personal danger surrounding them, the eyes of both saw what they could not believe to be other than spectral, and heard sounds which they did not believe to be the voices of living men. For just when their glances were thrown seaward for an instant, the thick curtain of mist seemed to lift, as if it had been the edge of a skirt swept aside in passing; and what appeared to be a whale boat, with its high prow and stern, swept across the line of vision, rising and falling on the mad waves as easily as if it had been rowing an idle race on the Pacific, and a clear hearty, ringing laugh came down on the storm, from lips that should have been silent or uttering cries of horror in the presence of such destruction. But an instant-then the curtain shut down again, and the untimely laughter was heard no more; so that neither Barnard North nor his son could have said whether they had seen a boat formed by mortal hands, or heard the sound of human voices. They had but little time to think, in the imminence of that danger, for the strongest nerve and the steadiest energy seemed to avail them nothing in rowing out from that whirling mass of broken timbers. Onward it came, lifted and dashed by the power of the angry waves that were seething like a caldron in which half the world had been engulfed-lifted and dashed as if it had been nothing more than a mass of veriest splinters hurled down a waterfall. The Wrecker saw that their last hope of succoring even one of the perishing was gone-all that was left them now, was one close and deadly struggle for their own lives. 
               "Back water, boy! back water, strong and steady!" shouted the father. "That timber will make mince meat of us in a moment!" And as he applied that sinewy arm to the oar in the performance of the dangerous feat of putting his boat about in that hell of turbulent waters, he groaned almost aloud with the remembrance that all was vain-that none, after all that toil and danger, were to be succored-and that perhaps the black shadow and presentiment of the past night might be on the eve of a fatal fulfilment. 
               "Oh, if I could but have carried one ashore it would have been something!" he murmured within himself. "This is pitiless, unmerciful, oh God!" He little knew or dreamed that he might indeed carry one ashore and think that God was yet more unmerciful! He as little knew for what he was really struggling, in saving the life of that one, as a little child or a blind man groping in the dark, knows of the destination towards which either is proceeding! 
               Rapid as had been the exertion to put the little boat about, she had not quite escaped the broken timbers. Almost at the instant when they began to shoot shoreward, and when the fearful cries of the drowning were dying upon their cars in the increasing distance, a piece of spar shot whirling alongside, and with a thrill Robert North saw that a white sleeve was thrown around it. 
               "Look, father, look," he exclaimed. "There is a man clinging to that spar!" 
               "So there is, my boy!-so there is!" was the quick, nervous reply of the Wrecker. "He is yet alive, or he would have lost his hold. Back water, sharp, and perhaps we can reach him before he goes down." 
               Instantly was the order obeyed, and almost in an instant the way of the little boat was partially checked, and the spar shot alongside. It was indeed a human arm thrown around it, the white shirt sleeve mak- ing it easily distinguishable. As it swept by it came nearest to Robert, who sat farthest astern, and holding his oar by one hand, he reached over to grasp the object that seemed so precious. His hand was upon it-he had unloosed the dying hold upon the spar, and drawn it within the reach of the father, and Barnard North had just reached over to aid in drawing in the body, when another broken timber surged heavily under the stern of the boat on the opposite side, nearly overturning her. The old Wrecker had been in many such perils before-the impulse to throw himself athwart, dragging the inanimate form of the rescued man with him, was obeyed like lightning, and the boat was righted. 
               Alas, for Robert North! There must always be a sacrifice of the best and the noblest when some deed worth eternal record, is to be accomplished! The brave boy had reached too far over the side, in his effort to drag in the drowning man-his foothold was not secure-he did not instantly realize the full extent of the peril as did the Wrecker; and as the boat righted, the maddened father, too far away to grasp him, saw him lunge heavily overboard, apparently striking his head upon the very spar from which he had just drawn the drowning man-saw him disappear in a mass of whirling timber that had overtaken them in their delay-gone! down in the maddened waters! lost! 
               Lost! lost! How could that horrible thought find place, which was that moment creeping into the tortured brain of Barnard North? His son-his eldest and his favorite! More-a thousand times more-his wife's-Rachael's son-the son whom she had implored him, not an hour before, as he loved her, not to drag away from her arms and drown him! Oh powers that permit while they pity suffering!-could human agony go further? 
               All thought of his own safety was for the moment abandoned-all thought even of the insensible form that lay in the boat beside him. The broken timbers might whirl and the rough breakers threaten him with instantaneous destruction: he but sat with his eyes fixed on the spot where his son had disappeared, and glancing thence to leeward with one faint hope that he might not have been so seriously injured as to be rendered insensible-that he might have grasped at some piece of timber or spar and be yet rising again to the surface. No! no!-there was no such bewildering joy for the shoreman. Moments of agony passed and he did not reappear, and the Wrecker too well knew that, beaten insensible by the blow of the spar as he fell overboard, he had gone down where so many of the brave and noble had preceded him-drowned! 
               But a few of those terrible moments had passed when the catastrophe was rendered certain; and an iron sternness settled upon the heart of Barnard North as he turned his prow towards his desolate home. Agony had done its worst-it could do no more to enervate-all after effect was but a restoration to the normal condition of body; and though partially stupefied by that crushing blow which seemed to have fallen upon him direct from heaven, he was once more the lonely and athletic Wrecker in his boat, looking out for the preservation of the lives of others, and for his own. 
               The figure at the bottom of the boat moved. Released from the whelming waters that had so nearly been his death, those very waters, in another shape, were giving him life! The spray that dashed into the boat fell upon his face and shocked him from insensibility. There was sensation and returning animation. He would live. The Wrecker saw the movement, and remembered with a bitter pleasure that he should indeed carry home with him one life. Nay, he thought more-whether the saving of this man might not stand him in some sort of stead with Rachael North-almost relieve him from the upbraidings which her heart must shower upon him even if her lips refused to give them utterance. Poor man!-some of us have seen a dear little child making the same calculation over the possibility of mollifying parent or mistress for the loss of a broken pitcher; and there is nothing more melancholy or more touching in life. Waiving his own grief and insensibly his own proprietorship in the drowned boy, the Wrecker was really thinking how far, in the heart of his wife, the one life carried back with him might atone for that which had disappeared into the Invisible and the Inevitable. 
               Then for a moment the Wrecker abandoned his oars and let the little boat drive on before wind and sea. It might have been that he no longer thought his safety of much consequence; it might have been that the worst of the danger was really over. Sternly he leaned down to the form moving in returning life at the bottom of the boat, drew from the pocket of his rough coat a flask of brandy that had probably never paid duty at any of the custom-houses of the great ports, and forced a portion of it between the lips that were yet only half released from the set of death. Until then he had scarcely seen the face of the rescued man, and it was only then that he saw what he had been like when in life and health. He appeared to be young-not over twenty-five years of age, well-dressed, though in clothing that spoke of mercantile instead of sea-faring life, with slight, active form, pleasant face, and silky, curling dark hair and whiskers. Altogether a person who seemed to have been one of some condition, and well worth the saving from a watery grave at any cost less than that which had in reality been paid for him! 
               Directly Barnard North heard a sigh issuing from the lips, and knew that the restorative had taken effect and that there was life enough to last during the passage shoreward. Then he threw himself again upon the thwart, took in both hands the blades that had only a few minutes before filled his son's hand with his own, and taking one more hopeless look for that lost head among the broken timbers, swept away again before wind and wave towards the beach. Some merciful providence had preserved him from a peril that would have seemed inevitably fatal; and now, no longer breasting the storm, the danger was indeed far less imminent than it had been. His single strength was quite sufficient to keep the flying boat steady before the gale and the white combing of the waves; and with heart deadened within him and nerves only mechanically performing their office, he drove onward towards that home which had within an hour been made so desolate. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               A MOTHER BEREIT OF HER FIRST-BORN. 
               NATIONS have hung with hushed breath upon the event of a battle, and helpless women and children have stood almost as statues to witness the event of some struggle made by their defenders against the coming of outrage and dishonored death. Suspense is always terrible, when any issue worth the living for or the dying for is involved in that which yet lies buried in the womb of time; and the nearer to the moment when the truth is to be known, the more unendurable the excitement. Thank heaven that the end soon comes, in most instances, even if sorrow and loss be the burthen of it: not long could the mind endure those fluctuations between hope and fear; and half humanity, with a little longer trial, might become akin to the poor girl who has watched and waited for the return of her lover beyond sea, until the brain is crazed, the very thought of all other sensations forgotten, and she can do nothing more, during all the years of life, than wait and watch! There was no romance-only plain, hard reality in the exposure and the suspense, and yet it may be doubted whether the human eye and the brain it served ever kept a more agonizing watch than that fully endured by Rachael North and partially by her children, while husband and son were absent on their perilous errand. 
               The mother prayed, but prayed a wild, agonizing prayer that had far more of complaint and helpless moaning than of true dependence upon the Ruler of the Storm. Do such prayers fail to rise into the pure, clear atmosphere of faith, and are they only mocking words to which the All-father would sacrifice the glory of his nature by bending down to listen? Who knows?-who will ever know until the end when prayer is no longer necessary or possible? The Wrecker's wife may have committed a fault-even a crime; but she had no power, for the moment, to do otherwise. There was that over her eyes which seemed to blind her even worse than the storm, and a terrible sinking of the heart which forbade her to hope; and no heart lifts above when hope is a mockery. 
               So passed that fearful hour-her children gathered around her, alternately regarding the mother whose agony of fear drowned their own, and endeavoring to peer out through the misted panes into the storm. At length there was a change in the situation and the feeling-whether it was to be for the better or the worse, none could tell. Young Barnard, whose eyes had been straining for a glimpse seaward until he had alternately seen and lost, in imagination, nearly every description of occurrence ever known upon any sea-coast,-at last sprung back from the window and clapped his hands with a suddenness that started all. 
               "The boat! the boat, mother!" he cried. "See-they are coming back!" 
               "Are you sure, Barnard, sure? Oh, heaven grant that it may be so!" spoke Rachael North, as she sprang from the chair into which she had thrown herself so hopelessly, and dashed her face against the cool wet panes of the window. "No, Barnard, no! you are mistaken!" she cried, as her glance swept the sea and she saw nothing. 
               Then the boat, that had been for the moment hidden by a crest as it came on, once more emerged to sight, and the anxious wife saw it. "Yes, thank God, there it is!" she almost screamed. "It is the boat-I know it! They are safe!-they must be safe!" 
               A moment sufficed to throw again around her the rough outside clothing necessary to meet the fury of the storm, and the same space of time made ready her children to accompany her. One glance more through the window and the rising of the boat once more on the crest of a wave, showed that it was rapidly nearing the beach; and, those hasty preparations completed, the mother and her children were flying down the causeway. 
               They were on its edge, overlooking the beach. Through the thick driving of the storm they could see the boat at brief intervals; and no long time elapsed before the agonized wife and mother, peering with her anxious eyes towards it, saw that the tall form of her husband sat upright in the boat, and that he sat alone! There was no other rower! 
               "My son! my son!-he is gone, as I believed! Oh, my God!-why did they take him from me?" were the exclamations that broke from her lips as she looked; and her children, yet more frightened than before, gathered close around her as if each could strengthen the other by proximity in that moment of sorrow. 
               "No, no!-he is there; but what can have happened to him!" again broke from her lips, as she saw that the boat contained a second form, not upright at the oars but lying extended upon the thwarts. "He may be killed! My husband would never be rowing alone in that sea, if some terrible accident had not happened to Robert! Oh, what is this day to bring me?" And she dashed down from the causeway to the very verge of the sea, followed by her children, unmindful of the waves that burst so fiercely around and over them. 
               A moment, and the little boat touched the beach-a position in which, with the sea at that instant running, had she been built on the straight-keeled model of the modern "life boats," for which inventors find wealth and title while the little wooden half-moon surf-boats of the shoremen really do the work of life-saving,-she would have been inevitably thrown over endlong, crushing all beneath her, before she could have been urged up the sand beyond the reach of the next roller. Another moment, and Barnard North, darting hastily but almost mechanically over the side, had forced the little craft beyond the more dangerous waves and the fatal undertow. His wife saw that he sprang into the water alone, even as he had been rowing alone. An instant brought her flying to the boat, while it was yet in the very edge of the surf, and she was literally dragged back by her hold upon it, as the strong arms compelled it towards safety. One sudden frightened glance into it, to see a stranger lying between life and death across the seats-no son-no son!-one long hopeless gaze to make sure that the form so eagerly sought could not be concealed from her view in the fragile little boat: then the mother sprang to the Wrecker's side, caught him almost painfully by the arm, and shrieked rather than spoke: 
               "Barnard North, where is my son?" 
               A fearful question, to the man who has taken away what he cannot return. Just such a one as that which Althea asked when Meleager returned from the hunt of the Calydonian Boar; when neither Toxeus nor Plexippus could be given alive to her call; and when not even the warning of Atropos long before, nor the memory of the love she had borne the babe nursed at her bosom, could hold back her rash hand from dashing into the fire that brand upon which hung the life of the conqueror. For the moment, to Althea, the life of her son was nothing-the lives of her brothers were all; and since then there has been many an Althea, madened with grief to say and do what could only double the terrible bereavement! 
               It would seem that neither wife nor children had up to this time been observed by the Wrecker, for he gazed at her as if surprised at her presence, or as if his eyes scarcely took in and comprehended the figure before him,-then mechanically began to draw up his boat, with its still half-insensible freight, yet further beyond the reach of the waves. Did he indeed see the wife of his love, with the keen natural eyes that had been his only an hour before? Who can say? Certain it is that to the eye of any one who saw him, some question of his sight ever after presented itself-that to his dying day Barnard North never entirely lost that fixed and stony stare which had come upon him in the moment of his first great calamity, and in which he might be looking far beyond the gaze of the natural eye, or only staring at comparative vacancy! 
               "My son! my son! Barnard North, where is he?" again screamed the terrified mother, her voice rising even above the roar of the elements, as she grasped the arm of her husband with a roughness that she had never before presumed to use since the bridal hour had made them one, more than twenty years before. That agonized scream and that rough gesture were heard and seen by more than had heard the first intimation of the bereavement; for word had reached the village that another ship had struck on the bar and was going to pieces, and a number of the shoremen, all unconscious of the desperate venture and its termination, had by this time reached the fatal beach. 
               If the father's heart had been so stunned that it was for the time little less than dead, it was awoken by the distracted cries of his wife; if the knowledge of an agony beyond his own, which his first words were to cause, had thus far kept him silent, neither the motive or the restraint existed longer. Shaking off the grasp of the half-maddened woman, he lifted his heavy storm-hat one moment from his head, dashed from his forehead the thick hair which had blown over it, and answered through his set teeth: 
               "Woman, your son is gone!" 
               "Gone!" shrieked the bereaved mother, now more than ever beside herself with her terrible grief-"Gone! Gone where? Barnard North, have you dared to take away my son and not bring him back?" 
               "He is gone, I tell you!" said the Wrecker, his hard manner never changing, and no more traces of tears creeping to his eyes than if those orbs had been carved out of stone. "He is drowned! I lost him in trying to save the life of that half-dead man in the boat." 
               At that moment a new element of grief was added to that which had already been painful enough, for poor little Charlotte, who had scarcely recognised the loss before, caught the word "Drowned!" as it fell from her father's lips, and broke into such an agony of cries and tears and sobs as threatened her life and set both her brothers and half a dozen of the shoremen to caring for her welfare even in the midst of the greater excitement. 
               "Drowned! oh, my poor brother Robert! He will never come back to us in the world! I shall never see him again! Oh, my poor brother Robert! Oh father, mother, what will become of us!" Her hands wringing pitifully the while, her face white as the foam of the breakers, and hysteria probable the next moment. Others heard, saw and cared for her-for the time the mother seemed neither to hear or see; her heart was evidently lying far out beyond the surf line, wherever the body of her drowned boy might be drifting! 
               "Gone!" "Drowned!" "Poor Robert!" "The noblest boy on the coast!" "How did it happen?-does anybody know?" Such were the exclamations that broke from the shoremen as they began to realize the painful event. 
               "But this man will die yet, if something is not done for him!" suggested one of the thoughtful, who observed the situation; and preparations were at once made to remove and care for him. 
               "Where shall we take him?" "What shall we do with him?" were words that the dulled sense of the Wrecker heard, and he answered: 
               "To my house-to my house at once. Save him if you can! God knows that his life has cost me dearly enough!" 
               "What has it cost me, Barnard North?-what has it cost me?" cried the inconsolable woman, breaking out into a fresh agony of grief. "Where is my boy, I ask? Where is my boy? You took him away from me, in spite of everything I could say to you: now how have you dared to come back and not bring him?" 
               "He is lost-drowned, I tell you, Rachael!" was the reply of the Wrecker. "He has gone where many a noble man and boy have gone before him, trying to save life on this fatal coast. Woman, you know all, and you cannot bring him back again by screaming for a twelvemonth. Go home!" 
               "Home, with my boy drowned!" was the reply of the mother, the tone blended between anger and a complaining wail. "Home? Barnard North, have you no feeling for your dead son, or for me?" 
               "Go home, woman-I tell you, once more!" spoke Barnard North, in a voice that rang so sharp and stern through his set teeth that it caused the shoremen to cast a wondering eye upon him who had always spoken so gently to her-now harsh, frozen and apparently unfeeling. They were not the first, as they will not be the last, to mistake agony for coldness-intensity of feeling for its total absence! 
               The wife mechanically obeyed. Stunned and broken by the calamity, and with her lips having already uttered words that could never be recalled, she said no more for the moment, but summoning her children to her, and assisted by some of the sympathising shoremen, they went slowly up the causeway, with bent heads, regardless now of the storm, and entered the desolate cottage to which some of the others had already preceded them with the body of the half-drowned man from the wreck, whom they were faithfully endeavoring to resuscitate. 
               Barnard North slowly followed, when he had secured his boat-his head, too, bent upon his breast, and despair tugging at his heart-strings. 
               There are men capable of sudden and singular changes under peculiar circumstances; and there are circumstances calculated to change almost entirely the identity of the person affected. Both would seem to have been illustrated in the Wrecker and his surroundings; for the same frank warm-hearted and generous man who had launched that day to save the perishing, went not up the causeway on his return. This after events too well developed. For the rest-it is not for us to enter fully into the mentality of that man so sorely tried, and attempt to explain the causes that might have produced so marked and singular a change. That he had suffered a terrible shock in the loss of his son, following after the harrowed feeling and ominous depression of the night before, there could be no doubt; and the developments already made with reference to the stony gaze of his eyes even when he landed, are quite sufficient to show that most painful effect. But there would seem to have been something more-an additional shock less rare than terrible. 
               More men have become jealous of their own children, than will readily be believed by those who only skim the surface of society; and more households have been first rendered unhappy and afterwards altogether desolated, by the intervention of their own offspring between the two who were once the whole world to each other, than will ever be fully realized until all the mists and films are cleared away from human sight. It has been seen that the Wrecker, at the moment of his great loss, had the same premonition of the upbraidings which his wife would pour upon him for dragging away her child, that he had the night before experienced of the grief and loss then accomplished,-and that he even seemed to be calculating whether the carrying home of the one rescued man might not do something to make those upbraidings less severe and unendurable! This very anxiety shows how tender must have been his heart with reference to such comment upon his conduct-how defenceless he must have felt himself to be against that one tongue whose words of love and approbation had been the music of his life. May it not have been that the finding of his worst anticipations realized-those words of Rachael North which showed her child as being set higher up in her affections than all others, so that even he became but a mere subject for upbraiding, in comparison-may it not have been that this stirred some latent string of jealousy in his composition, awoke a feeling of wrong and outrage, made him hopeless, stony, stolid-almost mad? May not one word of kindness and affection even in the midst of grief-one whisper denoting that he, the husband, was after all that had occurred or might occur, the object dwarfing all others, in whose safety the most terrible of all other bereavements could be endured if not forgotten-may not this have been what the sore heart needed, and its reception or its denial the turning point between a happiness yet possible and a misery too deep and terrible for contemplation? Wo for humanity if then and in many other instances a wail has become a crime, and a bitter word done a more fatal work than could have been accomplished by bludgeon or stiletto! 
               For a time after reaching the house, Rachael North seemed to throw off some portion of the misery which had so prostrated her, and to return to her own kindly nature towards the suffering. She wept continually, and at painfully brief intervals broke out into sobs which threatened to become hysteric; but she assisted in resuscitating and caring for the poor, half-drowned and perishing man, whose welfare had cost her and hers so dearly. Half an hour of exertion, coupled with the skill in bringing back life to the lifeless, which is inseparable from long residence on the coast, strengthened the feeble flutter of breath which had first been observed, and at last restored the stranger to full consciousness, and enabled him in a feeble voice to thank them all for his safety, and convey some idea of the vessel to which he had belonged, her port and destination. 
               The rescued man gave his name as Thomas Ilillyer, and his position as supercargo of the good ship "America" from Marseilles, for a northern port on the American coast, with a valuable cargo of silks, wines, and other costly goods. He was, when life had fairly returned to him, a fine-looking young man, the general features of whose appearance have already been given as he lay senseless in the boat. He seemed to be about twenty-eight to thirty of age, was unmarried, as he stated, displayed much cheerfulness and interest in his conversation when he became able to converse without difficulty, and had evidently been accustomed to cultivated society. 
               There had been upwards of a hundred persons on the vessel when she sailed-forty of them belonging to the crew, and the remainder cabin and steerage passengers. One or two had been lost from the yards, at the coming on of the storm, and two or three others had been killed by various accidents to spars and rigging, as the danger became more imminent; the remainder had been alive when the ship struck the bar. Of all these, he only lived to tell the tale of destruction. 
               Sad, indeed, was the picture in the little cottage that night, when the dusk fell and the tallow candles were lighted to drive away the gloom of darkness and storm. There had been no heart for eating, even had the most costly food been set before its occupants; and besides the little basin of gruel for the invalid, and a few mouthsful of food swallowed by the others in the midst of a choking sensation which made it a penance instead of an enjoyment, any pretence of supper was ignored, and that outer room, where it should have been eaten, made a temporary hospital for the sick in body and in heart. Barnard North, sitting bowed down with his head between his hands, most of the time insensible even to the somewhat profuse, and overstrained expressions of Hillyer's thankfulness when he had fairly recovered his speech, and when he looked up to answer at long intervals, doing so with fixed eye, and suffering alike in word and gesture; Rachael North, alternately stony cold and feverishly tortured with anguish; the younger members of the family, hovering between unquiet sleep and agonized wakefulness, with Charlotte, weak, weeping and half hysteric; and over all, during most of that dismal period, except when the words of Hillyer compelled an answer, a silence as dismal and a shadow as dark as even the grave could have supplied. On a rude settee, meanwhile, was stretched the supercargo, as yet too weak to sit upright, though his tongue was unloosed; and beside him, unwilling to leave the house of watching and sorrow, were two or three of the shoremen, who had remained, and would remain with them through the night, while the remainder had gone homeward. 
               Over all within the cottage, except Hillyer, who had not been informed of the preceding catastrophe-in addition to their personal grief was the fearful consciousness of the dead bodies from the wreck of the night before, waiting in the out-house their melancholy burial; but ever surging up came that other and bitterer thought, absorbing and dwarfing all beside-of those whose bodies from the later wreck must be beating among the broken timbers on the shore, perhaps the handsome curly head and manly form of poor young Robert North swaying and floating crushed and bruised among them. 
               And so closed the night upon the cottage of the Wrecker of Topsail, and upon the neighboring shore. How many nights, painfully like it, have closed down and laid the burthen of darkness added to that of grief and loss, upon the hearts of the dwellers by the sea, of all times and all countries! 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VII. 
               MOONLIGHT ON TOPSAIL BEACH. 
               IT was said, at the close of the last chapter, that while a few of the shoremen remained at Barnard North's to comfort the afflicted family and assist in looking after the restoration of Hillyer, the rest of them had gone homeward. This was true, but they had not all gone home! Most of them had done so, waiting the morning and the abatement of the storm before they would make any effort for securing the property certain to drive ashore during many hours, and for taking up and burying the bodies that could not fail to accompany it, as well as those already secured and lying ready for sepulture in the out-house of the Wrecker's cottage. 
               Among those who had not gone home in any sense indicating that their labor had concluded for the day, was one Gil Davis, keeper of a low groggery and a house of doubtful reputation generally, lying under the lee of the low range of woods between the village of Topsail and the shore, and half a mile back from the beach. His house was well known to be sending abroad destruction in the neighborhood, through the bad liquor which he dealt out at scandalous profits, and scarcely less in the low gambling assemblies and lascivious dance-parties which he constantly invited; and it may have been suspected of doing more and worse, in affording a shelter to a class of thieves and freebooters who habitually disgrace every shore section, and a hiding-place for the goods which they managed to abstract from the cargoes of stranded vessels. Whether these suspicions were or were not then well developed, the fact was beyond doubt, as after events too well demonstrated. With Davis two others remained near the shore-Tom Wolf, a fisherman whose reputation well accorded with the house which he most frequented, and a companion who often "hunted in couples" with him, but of whom none seemed to know more than that he bore the ominous soubriquet of "Cain," that he was cross-eyed and villainous-looking, and that he seemed to be as friendless in the world as if he had indeed been the yet-living first murderer. They had other designs, suspected by none besides themselves-designs which should enrich them with unhallowed gain, no matter how much they might blacken the fame of the whole coast upon which they had fixed their vampyre existence. 
               When night closed down on the day which had been so fatal to the happiness of Barnard North and his family, the three persons just named might have been seen assembled in their place of usual resort-the groggery of Davis, waiting until the time should come for those operations which were as legitimate to them as any honest deed to an honest man, and whiling away the time of probation with a species of amusement much more common throughout the world than the reading of Holy Writ or the exercise of benovolence. 
               A low straggling building, standing between the wood-edge and the marsh, squalid and storm-beaten, but still tenantable; and what had been intended for one story compelled to be two by making the lower ceiling scarcely higher than the head, and the attic little more than a chicken-coop. The house long guiltless of paint, and some of the panes of the little upper windows supplanted by a hat, an old pair of trowsers and the thrustout head and neck of a demijohn. A pretence at a piazza in front of the north or most important end of the building; but the roof of the piazza half rotted away and one of the three posts fallen from its proud position, as if it, like some of the visitors, had the power of becoming intoxicated, and supporting itself ignobly against the tumbled-down railing that extended from one of the remaining posts to the bare and dingy boards of the front. A shed at the south end, shelving off from the house, and with such debris and litter around the door as might designate it to be a stable for a poor horse or poorer cow. At a little distance from the shed what had once been a light farm-wagon, bare of paint, the body broken, and the whole seeming as if it must shackle to pieces in the first rough rut it chanced to encounter. On the seat-board of this dilapidated conveyance, regardless of the rain, what might have been a single harness in better days, before more than half the straps and the buckles had been supplanted by strings and bent nails. On a post before the door, creaking in the storm-wind a swinging sign from which the rains of many years had not yet been able to accomplish the whole mercy of washing out the legend: "Fisherman's Home, by Gilbert Davis," with the word "grocery" scrawled in small muddy letters over the door itself. Such, with a pile of driftwood lying at the upper end of the building and a few old barrels and a heap of ashes balancing it at the lower-was the outward appearance of the resort which had so unfortunately fallen under the suspicion of many of the good people resident on and about the coast of Seaboard. 
               Within, on that occasion and when the night had fairly closed down, the scene was such as might have been imagined, by a close observer, from the whole contour of the surroundings. There seemed to be two rooms on the floor; for out of a door which separated them had two or three times during the past half hour been thrust the sharpest nose, the most virago like countenance and the most villainously uncombed red head bedecked with a cap with a torn lace border, that ever distinguished womanhood since the supplementary invention of the sex. This was a lady called by Davis himself and some others, his "wife," but by many others-people of irreverent tongue and suspicious disposition, his "woman"-whatever may have been intended as the hidden meaning of that noun-substantive. The lady seemed to be ill at ease and not a little out of temper, at something which she designated as "lazy" and "poking," honoring her hearers with the appellation of dirty, idle thieves, not willing to earn the salt in their pot-pie, and deserving to be taken across somebody's knee and well whaled." How nearly the cidevant Mrs. Gil Davis was correct in her description of character, as she dodged her head out of and into the door, and fired these shots into the group in the outer room,-is a matter of no consequence. Nor did her sharp epithets appear to produce half so much effect upon the persons she addressed, as did the whistling of the storm-wind and the roar of the surf coming up from the shore. 
               In that outer room were assembled the three worthies who have already been designated; and there was that in room and occupants, equally unwholesome, hang-dog and repulsive. The apartment may have been ten by twelve, with bare ceiling, low and smoke stained; with three close-shuttered windows of glass so dirty that the precaution of the shutters seemed to be unnecessary; and with the freely ejected tobacco saliva making such dark puddles among the thick white sand which strewed the floor, that there seemed danger of a high tide of that liquid, sweeping over and desolating the whole sandy territory. One end of the room was crossed by a short and narrow counter, on which stood a cheese-box, a rusted tin funnel and a couple of rusted measures of the same material. On some shelves behind it lay a few bars of soap, half a dozen bunches of dip-candles, and a few other worthless nothings which enabled the proprietor of the establishment to add to the name of tavern the fiction of "grocery"; while on the same shelves and without the counter were visible what might well have been designated as the facts of the business, in the shape of a keg of gin and another of bad brandy in the former place, and in the latter a whole barrel of New England or molasses rum, with a little puddle lying under the spigot from late drawings, perfuming the atmosphere with an aroma so atrocious that the strongest of nerves were necessary to avoid falling into a dead faint on entering the precincts. 
               At a greasy pine table standing without the counter, playing with a pack of cards yet greasier than the table, and lighted by two sputtering tallow candles which just supplied superlative to the previous positive and comparative of grease,-sat the worthy three who had been the subjects of the wifely objurgation. Gil Davis himself short and stout, not ill-looking in feature except for a perpetual and unnecessary cunning smile which might have put keen students of physiognomy on their guard against him,-and dressed (as became a "proprietor" in the presence of mere sufferance) in a dark shoreman's rig which would have been positively neat and jaunty but for its repulsive dirtiness and fishy smell; Tom Wolf, a spry little fellow with a red head, rough features, and a suit of well worn fustian; and Cain, tall, gaunt, sinister-eyed, in dark clothes that had been wool but were rapidly approaching rags, and yet the man of the three in whom a weak woman or a defenceless child would soonest have trusted, if empowered by heaven to read below the mask which more or less closely covers all human faces. 
               "Old sludge" seemed to be the game affected by these boon companions; and they were neither playing it in the strictest sobriety (for there was a tin cap of New England rum on the table, out of which each sipped at intervals),-nor yet for mere pastime (for the heaps of copper pennies, with a few worn sixpences and shillings intermixed, which occasionally changed in size and location, told a very different story). They were, in short, filling up the period of enforced waiting, by gambling-not as extensively but just as injuriously and fiendishly as they could have done with their legs under the mahogony, with plate glass flashing around them, in one of the gilded saloons of a later day in the great city. 
               The fickle goddess fortune, if casting any regard whatever in the direction of Cain, had certainly been showering frowns instead of smiles upon him; for his heap was by far the smallest of the three, while that of Davis was in a corresponding degree the largest. And it so chanced that at the moment when our attention is called to the trio, the landlord of the "Fisherman's Home" was dealing the cards, concluding the operation with a somewhat triumphant slap upon the top of the pack and a smile of even more than his usual grinning impertinence, as the bandy legs and abdominal rotundity of the Knave of Hearts came into view. 
               "One for his heels!-that makes me five," announced the successful dealer, as he dropped the cards. 
               "Yes," said Cain, slowly. "Gil Davis, do you know that that is the fifth or sixth time that you have turned Jack since we began playing?" 
               "So he has!" said Wolf, as if he had not before thought of the singular fact. 
               "Well, what if I have?" asked Davis. "Can I help the cards happenin' to lay just in that way, I should like to know?" 
               "No, can't say as you kin," answered Cain. "Leastwise, you don't help it. An' it's my opinion, Gil Davis-" 
               "What?" spoke the grocery-keeper, sharply, the smile gone from his face, and his brows knitting threateningly. 
               "It's my opinion," pursued Cain-"that them Jacks don't come up o' theirselves, and that they kind o' stick to your fingers, Gil Davis!" 
               "Do you mean to say that I cheat,-you?" and the proprietor of the groggery rose to his feet, his cards still in one hand, but the fingers of the other (the right), opening and shutting nervously. 
               "That's just what I do mean,-you! You slip them Jacks, and you know you do, Gil Davis!" was the response, the speaker still retaining his seat. 
               Quick as thought, and before any one could have expected such a movement, Davis reached suddenly over and brought his tall antagonist such a blow with his half-clenched hand on the left cheek and side of the head, that the assaulted man came near measuring his length from his chair to the floor. He did not fall, but rose after an instant, and was seen to spit into his right hand-a somewhat filthy motion, but one that in certain latitudes contains a threat which does away with all thought of its cleanliness or the opposite. No word was spoken, but Tom Wolf, who involuntarily rose between, was waiting for the blow to pass over him, that should send the landlord sprawling,-when there was another of those feminine interruptions. 
               "Ugh!-you poor, miserable, lazy whelps!" was the pleasant adjuration, from the door of the rear room. "There you are yet-gamblin' and quarrelin' and fightin', while somebody else is helpin' themselves to all the best of everything! Oh, if I had my will of you, Gil Davis, and you Tom Wolf, I could cut you up into inch bits, for a lot of miserable, shiftless, thievin' good-for-north-in's!" 
               A little interruption is sometimes sufficient to check the course of wrath as well as of love. Whether there was something in that voice which literally cowed him, or whether he was easily turned from a purpose by any accident that intervened, Cain dropped his hand, made no more demonstration to repay the blow he had received, and merely said: 
               "Well, there-there-Mother Davis, we're a goin'!" 
               It really seemed that the interruption had been effectual, not only to send the slattern woman back into her retreat without her seeing any act of hostility committed, but even to restore peace and fellowship among the scandalous brotherhood. For Cain, the aggrieved, walked away to the door which opened upon the dilapidated piazza, and glanced out at the weather. He muttered something, as he stood looking out, but those within did not hear his words or know that any sound had passed his lips. Only those powers which see the faintest shade amid the lightning flash, and hear the faintest whisper of a little child amid the booming crash of the thunder-only they heard the gaunt shoreman say: "One thing more, Gil Davis! A slap, and from him! See if I don't pay it all at once, one of these days!" When he came back towards the table, a moment after, it was very evident that the blow was forgotten in the greed of unhallowed gain; for he said, while the last dashes of the storm were yet heard pattering against the windows of the groggery, and the hoarse booming of the surf yet came heavily in through the temporarily opened door: 
               "The woman's right, boys!-this thing won't last much longer. There is a lift, and the wind pulls a mite. We shall have pickin', mind I tell you, if that there ship had the silks and laces and all them other kinds of finery aboard." 
               "Bet we will!" was the reply of Davis, who seemed, like the other, to have forgotten all about the quarrel, the blow, and the upturned Jack which had caused both. Each of the companions had by this time gathered from the table the pile of pennies which more or less belonged to him, and the greasy pack of cards had been thrown back on one of the unoccupied shelves, to be used again and no doubt quarreled over again whenever occasion might require. The proprietor went on: "Ef there's anything in looks, the moon will give a glimmer sometime before midnight; and then, you know-for we daren't try them lanterns." 
               "Nary lantern!" said Wolf, who had stepped back to the table not alone to pick up his share of the pennies, but to take another sip of the fragrant extract of molasses that stood upon it. "Nary lantern!-'twouldn't do to-night, of all nights in the year. They'll be all up at Barney North's; and the old fellow himself won't sleep well, I reckon, after losing Bob. He may take it into his head to walk to the beach, sort o'restless, like, to see if he can't find him; and then that would be awk'ard! No, we must trust to the old seud for gettin' a peep at the purties!" 
               -"Said she was French," rejoined Davis. "Don't they have heaps o' fine things in them there furrin parts? Silk, eh? Brandy, may be! It wouldn't be a bad set up for the old place, would it, Wolf, if we could rope in a few kags of the rale stuff?" 
               "Well, it wouldn't!" was the emphatic endorsement of Wolf, while Cain went again to the door, opened it a little, and said: "Hark!" 
               They listened in silence for a moment. The rain had entirely ceased beating against the house, and a sudden lull in the noise of the surf announced that the east wind bore it to their ears no longer-that it had suddenly veered to the west, and the storm was over. Then all was activity in a moment; and the ci-devant Mrs. Davis, if she once more thrust out her head from the door of the rear-room, had no more occasion to scold, and was quite satisfied. The three comrades, whose bond of union was of so evil a char- acter, went out to the front of the house, looked once more and listened. The rain had indeed ceased. The sky was still heavily clouded, but in broken masses through which the moonlight began to struggle; and the scud, even at a height which denoted the steady direction of the wind, had stopped driving in from seaward. The hour hoped for by the desperate wreckers had come, with all its most injurious opportunities. 
               Yet a few moments the three lingered around the bar-room and the miserable piazza in front, but not resuming their game, and (the truth must be told, even should it redound to the credit of men who deserve no credit whatever) drinking no more, now that they were about to engage in work that might need the sure foot and the steady hand. A few moments, and then Gil Davis, going back to the door which led into the rear-room, called out, loudly and harshly: 
               "You Sail!-send out Nink, and tell him to hurry himself if he doesn't want all the skin took off of him!" 
               Scarcely a minute had elapsed, when Nink, so loudly called for, made his appearance, rubbing his eyes and half crying, as if suddenly and cruelly aroused from sleep, and blinking horribly, even in the dim light of the tallow candle, as if a whole flood of morning sunshine had been poured into his tender orbs. Poor little Nink!-he had indeed been suddenly and cruelly roused, from his deadly sleep of extreme weariness in the miserable garret loft over the kitchen, by a jerk and a slap from the lady of the house, the first almost throwing him prostrate on the floor, and the second setting him up nearly as erect and quite as tottering as a tenpin. Poor little Nink!-once more: what a diminutive, weazen, wretched looking object he was, to contemplate with the fact in view that such jerks, slaps, sudden awakenings and other outrages on the health and joy of childhood, were much more likely to be administered to him with regularity than the food necessary to keep life within his cowering body! He was probably twelve years of age, while he looked scarcely more than ten from his size, and at least sixteen in the unnatural development of face and the sharp speculation of his restless, frightened black eyes. The face was thin and pinched; the mouth always quivering as if with some grief just met or some fear ever present; the thin soft black hair that told of his nervous temperament, cut so short that it scarcely more than covered the grinning scalp beneath; and the hands and wrists, as they hung flaccidly out from the sleeves of his fustian jacket, seemed so thin, blue and relaxed, that they might easily fall away from his body, like the severed claw of a crab, without the intervention of any marked struggle. Whither he came or through what vicissitude the poor little fellow had passed before falling into the suit of miserable thread-bare fustian and the power of the Davises, is of no consequence in this connection: enough to know that he was the most abject of slaves to the most abandoned of petty tyrants; and all that the situation contained of horror, wrong and childish suffering, may well be imagined when so much is premised. 
               "Now then-hurry out there, you good-for-nothing!-will you?" was the affectionate salutation of the slattern woman as the poor boy stood for one instant in the door, rubbing his eyes and trying to collect thought enough to know whether he was alive or dead. Then came another slap which sent him reeling out of the door if it did not aid in restoring his muddled recollections; and the boy vanished. 
               A few minutes saw Davis, assisted by the still sleepy boy whom he cursed continually and would probably have stopped to beat again had time allowed,-bringing out from the miserable thatched stable behind the house the remains of a small sedge pony, and that animal being attached, by the mingling of leather and rope harness which has before been noted, to the crazy open wagon standing in front of the shed, which had, in the daylight, the ostensible duty of delivering fish from the shore to a considerable constituency, and which often took part, during the hours of darkness, in deeds as far from its proclaimed occupation, as were those of the pseudo-fishermen themselves from the calling which they boasted to all comers. This not-too-easy act of annexation accomplished, and a few ropes and a couple of boat-hooks thrown into the wagon, the party took their way towards the beach under the broadening glimmer of the clouded moon, the three men walking, and little Nink performing the more severe labor of riding and driving the sedge pony, by no means out of consideration for his tender years, but because he was a "light weight," a little less difficult of drawing over the wet marshes than their own bulky bodies. 
               The same fear of there being a watcher at Barnard North's, to which Wolf had alluded before starting, prevented their taking their course for the beach by the causeway. They struck down the coast for half a mile beyond the clump of woods, then crossed the marsh shoreward by a diagonal bush-road seldom used and half under water, and came out on the beach a few hundred yards below the dwelling of the Wrecker. 
               All the scene of profitable destruction which they had expected, presented itself when they came in sight of the range of the wreck. The sea was yet breaking heavily, but much less violently than it had been a few hours earlier; the wind was now blowing off land, with a gentleness little suggestive of the fierce fury which it had lately been displaying in another direction; and the moon, approaching its full, had sufficiently broken through its obstructing clouds to give all the light that was needed for the wreckers' unhallowed purposes. But oh, what was the scene which that struggling moon looked down upon, hiding its face behind a passing cloud the moment after, as if the very luminaries in heaven could feel for the pains and sorrows of earth and dreaded to gaze too long upon spectacles of death and destruction! Strewed along the beach for a mile were the sad relies of the storm, and especially those of the last wreck, whose fate has been but too circumstantially witnessed. Masses of broken timbers and plank-a few of the latter yet hanging together, denothing some portions of the side or bottom of a vessel; boxes, bales, casks and bundles, rocking and rolling hither and thither in the still angry surf, and grinding on the sand with violence threatening to crush them to atoms; and amid all, glancing here and there, the white upturned faces and dark clothing of some of the drowned, glimmering and glooming in the doubtful moonlight:-a sad, wild scene of devastation, such as every rough coast has witnessed but too often since the triremes of the Phnicians first ventured beyond the Pillars of Hercules. 
               These men might, at some times, have sorrowed over the fate of the drowned, and thought of their lonely burial; at others they might have been ready to rob the dead and wrench away the last feeble grasp of the fingers clinging to a spar for life-so great are the extremes of benevolence and crime among many of the men who give character to a sea coast. They did neither, now, for they had more summary and more profitable transactions in view. But poor little Nink, looking down from his low perch on the board seat of the wagon, and seeing the white faces, no doubt imbibed enough of horror at the spectacle to leaven the whole group with an otherwise forgotten semblance of humanity. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               GIL DAVIS ON A PRIVATE SPECULATION. 
               IT needed some dexterity, and involved much danger, to venture among the drifting masses of timber, planks, casks, and boxes crashing and grating against each other with the swell-indicated at the close of the last chapter; but these men were used to their rough trade, and they did not hesitate. Two or three casks, bearing marks that they contained costly liquors, were seized, dragged ashore, and by the united exertions of the three men carried up the beach and deposited in the crazy wagon. Then some of the boxes and packages were seized in their unquiet bed, hauled up and examined. Several were found, containing rich silks and velvets, soaked with the salt water and yet retaining value enough to make them an object in the hand of the merchant; and the covers of these were at once torn off and their contents carried up the beach to the wagon, the stripped packages being left behind to prevent all possible chance of the plunder being traced to the perpetrators. Half an hour sufficed to secure goods to the amount of many hundreds of dollars, and to supply the sedge-pony all the load with which it was considered prudent to burthen him over the wet marshes. 
               Their work was done and they were about to leave the beach, somewhat hurriedly, under the impression that the lulling of the storm and the broadening of the moonlight might tempt some other doubtful person in the same direction and betray the profitable haul which they had been making,-when Davis said to Tom Wolf: 
               "Wolf, look here. Pony's loaded too heavy for any of us to ride, you see, but you know the road and you can walk along side and drive. Nink 'ud dump the whole thing into one of them pond-holes, if he tried to drive, walkin' alongside. Just take the ropes and go on, you and Cain and that little whelp. I have a little something to 'tend to here before I go." 
               "What?-private speculations and no share, eh?" was the dissatisfied enquiry of the accomplices. 
               "Not another sixpence worth, boys, as I'm alive!" was the reply, in such a tone that the "boys" believed him. "I'm not a going to pick up anything more, but I've got something to do for all our good, and you'd better know nothing about it and then you can't answer awkward questions. Just go ahead and hurry up them things to the store; and when I get my little business done I'll come across lots and be there almost as soon as you are." 
               Wolf obeyed and took the reins, starting the heavily-loaded pony towards the same diagonal road over the marsh by which they had approached. Davis walked off up the beach, and when he had proceeded a hundred or two of yards the others saw him stoop down and imagined that he must be picking up something. Yet the impression of "honor among thieves" seemed to be so great, that neither of the two remaining wreckers believed him to be falsifying the pledge just given. Wolf drove on a little further inland, and the others walked by his side in silence,-when Cain said, as if the thought had suddenly come to his mind: 
               "Drive on, Tom; and as Nink and me can't do you any good, there ain't any use of our slumping along through these puddles. Dryer walkin' up above, and we'll jest try it and meet you up at the grocery if we don't catch you before you get there." 
                
               Wolf made no objection, for he was really not that description of nervous man anxious for company at night; and Cain and the boy, the latter yielding to the command, helplessly as he did to any order by whomsoever given,-disappeared from his view over the marsh northward of the bush-road which was really more than half under water. It is probable that Wolf even chuckled a little under the idea that they would find the upper crossing still wetter than the road, and that in all probability one or both of them would be in a pond-hole up to the neck, long before they reached the higher land beyond the meadows. So he drove cheerily on with the sedge-pony, walking beside the rickety wagon with its precious freight, and occasionally whistling a little in view of some pleasant memory or anticipation. 
               The two truants from the guard of the valuables, meanwhile disappeared from his sight, and when they had done so and reached such a distance that they could neither be seen nor heard, something occurred of which the poor little fellow, at least, could not previously have had the least idea. Cain, of the heavy hand and forbidding countenance, took the boy by the collar, checked his career and turned him round so that he could look into his face in the broad glare of the then almost cloudless moon, and said: 
               "Nink, do you know me?" 
               "Yess'r, I know you-you are Mr. Cain!" stammered the frightened boy. "Please don't kill me, Mr. Cain!-I am a poor little feller and hain't been doin' nothin' to no body!" 
               "Humph!" said Cain, retaining his hold upon the boy's collar. "You seem to understand me! You know that I could kill you, and that I would do so just as quick as I would kill a black snake, if I took a notion?" 
               "Yess'r, but please don't do it!" half sobbed the boy. 
               "Well, that depends upon whether you mind me or not!" said the man with the evil eye. "I'm a goin' to do something, and you're a goin' to help; and jest as sure as you ever say one word about it until I tell you to do it, jest as sure as you refuse to tell all about it if I order you to do it-down you go into one of these pond-holes, some night, and nobody'll ever know what has become of you!" 
               "Oh, yess'r, I'll do anything, if you only won't kill me!" answered the poor little fellow, awfully frightened, and yet a little relieved with the knowledge that the dire deed was not to be committed against him at once, and that there was still a chance to save that wretched life which had so far been nothing but one long suffering. 
               "Well, then, come along with me-do what I tell you, see what is to be seen and say not one word to anybody about it until I tell you, or you die, sure?" 
               Cain released the boy's collar from the grips of his hand, and with the single additional order: "Come along!" doubled partially on their former track and struck across the marsh, nearly north-eastward, walking rapidly, leaping from hussock to hussock and literally dragging the atom of boy when there seemed to be any danger of its being swallowed up and lost in some one of the ever recurring pond-holes. Two or three minutes of such travelling, and the two were back within sight of the beach and only hidden from it by an intervening hill. Then Cain stopped, said "Be still!" and dragged the boy where he as well as himself could look over at the wreck-strewn strip of sand. They were two or three hundred yards higher up the shore than they had been when the cargo of the wagon was selected; and along the beach was slowly moving a man with a bulky and heavy bundle under his arm, that mode of carrying it occasionally varied by its being thrown over his shoulder. Both recognized the burthen-bearer as Gil Davis, but only one had any idea what was the material of the burthen which he carried, or of the deed which he was about to do-a deed so dastardly that he could not trust the knowledge of it even with those evil companions who had along known enough of him to place him in a state-prison for life if not to put his neck in jeopardy, whenever they should choose to ensure their own safety by compromising his. To any one less far-seeing than Cain of the sinister eye, it would have seemed unaccountable what that man could have been doing, a few moments before, on the spot where they had just committed their theft-breaking apart with his heavy heel some of the wooden portions of the casings in which the costly silks had been enclosed, joining with them the canvas and oil-silk wrappings that had formed their inner protection, and making up the whole into that bundle to be carried so laboriously! What could be his purpose with those evidences of guilt, which it would have seemed policy to avoid with the utmost care, for any other than an absolute madman? 
               It was only a moment that Cain looked over the sand-hill, at the man moving along the beach; then he pulled the boy again by the arm, and said: "Come-and hurry along with you!" in a low, but distinct voice, and away the two went, rapidly over the hussocky marsh, still northward and bearing a little away from the beach. A few hundred yards, and little Nink knew that they were just below the cottage and outhouses of Barnard North. All seemed to be quiet in the neighborhood; no one was stirring, though the dim light that burned in the room where the mourning family watched with the only half-recovered Hillyer, showed through the white curtain at the rear of the house, which they approached. 
               Whatever Cain was doing, he seemed to be proceeding by an intuition which had in it no element of doubt, as very soon it became evident that it contained no mixture of error. Coming up to the out-house on the south-west, (the corner down the coast and away from it), he again took the boy by the arm, said: "Not a word out of you, above your breath, or you know what I will do with you!" and drew him down into the shadow of that side of the building, away from the now almost cloudless moon. Then, shoving the boy yet closer, and ordering him once more to remain quiet, he himself rose and stretched up to the little window of the outhouse. He looked within for a moment, then stooped down, lifted up the poor little fellow on one of his stalwart arms, and put his face to the window, bidding him see what he could see, and be still. 
               Cain never killed poor little Nink, (as of course he had no idea of doing), and the stretched boy had many along day before him, previous to his going to that miserable and neglected grave to which we have no call to follow. But long as may have been his life, and plentiful as may have been the scenes of horror and suffering through which he was called to pass,-be sure that to his dying day the scene which he then witnessed, remained imprinted on the mental retina so dividly that nothing else could ever quite abliterate it. Yet what was it, indeed, that he saw? 
               The thin, dark-haired, nervous temperament of the poor boy has been already suggested, as well as the horror with which from she seat of the wagon he looked down on the white faces of the drowned, rocking and drifting among the planks and timber in the surf. But that was in the outer air, with nearness and the grin quiet of death both a little lacking. How must the spirit within his childish frame, born to agony and abuse, have writhed when he saw those dead so near him, and saw them with stiffened limbs and staring eyes that seemed to be looking into his very face! There were two windows on the side of the out-house, looking towards the sea, and into both the moon was shining with nearly its full light, throwing into prommence the few nets, fishing-poles, oars, baskets, and other paraphernalia of the wrecker and the fisherman, with which the back part of the building, and some poles which crossed it from cave to cave, were occupied. But these were nothing to command attention in comparison with that other and deadlier sight which the vision of the frightened boy took in at the moment when he was lifted to the window. In the middle of the building stood two saw-benches or trestles, with three or four unplaned boards laid over them; and on those boards, ranged side by side, lay half a dozen of the ghastly dead of the first wreck. Two of them were women-the other four men and boys. All were more or less unclothed, with the white faces sadly balanced by those uncovered white feet, which seemed to have been bleached to an unnatural pallor by the waves before they were taken from the water. At least half of them had their eyes wide open and staring-staring as if the physical had been trying vainly to look into that awful future, upon which the mental had already entered. 
               But even this was not the worst. Running down the side of the building against which Cain and little Nink stood, and immediately under the window through which they were looking, was a work-bench with a wooden vise attached, at which Barnard North (Yankee mechanic like) sometimes spent his rainy days in re-shaping an oar, or fashioning some little thing of use in domestic economy. On that bench, and consequently within less than a foot of their faces as they looked, lay still two other bodies,-one that of a man with his eyes staring hideously wide in their very direction; and upon his breast, also face upward, a little girl of eight or nine, who had been so tightly clasped by his arm when they found the bodies, that no attempt had been made to separate what was no doubt father and daughter, dead together. Full upon these, through the upper part of one of the opposite windows, the moonlight shone, nearly as bright as the light of day, and a thousand times more ghastly and weird than any other ray than that of the moon could possible be. That light shone upon the set, stony faces, not yet changed to the purple hue of coming decay, and seemed to fill the expressionless eyes with a phosphoric glitter that was reflected fearfully back to those of the gazers. Scarcely even Cain, the man who had long out lived tenderness and good-feeling, could look upon that spectacle without a shudder; and to the weak, nervous boy at his side and partially upheld by his arm, the sight was horrible-truly horrible! He shivered as if struck with an ague, tried to compose his racked little nerves, and then moaned out: 
               "Oh, Mr. Cain, don't let them catch me! don't let them catch me! That man with the big eyes is a lookin' right at me! oh, please do take me away!" 
               "Hush, you little fool!" was all the reassuring word that the harsh man vouchsafed to the frightened child whom he must have understood to be suffering so terribly that reason might give way under a much longer continuance of the infliction. Still, he let him slip to the ground for a moment, where he stood cowering and sobbing, but without daring to utter another word aloud. What wails and plaints the poor little underling uttered internally, while thus stricken with mortal fear and dread-who shall imagine them?-who, except those powers which ever keep on recording so much that we shall shudder to meet at the last day, put them upon record? And what could possibly be the motive of the dishonest wrecker, in frightening the child to obedience and then dragging him all that distance to look in at the window of an out-house occupied by fishing nets and corpses? Surely he could not be so close a student of the emotions, as to take all that trouble for the mere purpose of analyzing the child's actions and expressions of terror! Surely he could not be cruel enough to leap through mud and mire and over salt marsh all that distance, for the pleasure of frightening the poor "runt" of Gil Davis and his wife out of the little remainder of his intellects! No-there must be some other motive, very different and much more exclusively personal! what could that motive be? 
               See!-there was a shadow passing one of the moonlit windows on the eastern side of the building, and dimming the light shining in on the ghastly array of dead. Cain, who had not changed his position, saw and recognised it. Hark!-there was a sound at the door of the out-house looking toward the dwelling-a sound like that which might have been produced by trying a hasp and fumbling with a pad-lock. Cain, with ears intent and watchful as his eyes, heard all this distinctly. Then the fumbling sound ceased, and the shadow came again to the window opposite. When it did so, the rough man stooped down, said: "Look in there again, and see what you can see, but if you make a sound I will drown you like a blind puppy!" and raised the boy again so high that he could catch a view of all that occurred within the building. Then both saw that the shadow at the window was a man-that he slowly raised the sash, stooped down, took up a bundle and lowered it carefully inside, then as carefully climbed within, himself. Then they saw him unloose the bundle, which appeared to have been bound with a strand of broken rope-take from it what appeared to be fragments of wood and pieces of canvas-hide portions of them behind the nets at the rear of the building, and still other portions among those that spanned the poles above, until the whole package was exhausted. Then they saw him shake his fist towards the door of the outhouse and the dwelling that lay beyond, muttering some words of rage, hatred and triumph,-saw him glance once more around the building, but with no more indication of being affected by the dead there lying than he might have been among so many eel-pots or casks of bad whiskey,-saw him creep again out of the window, shut down the sash as carefully as he had opened it, and disappear away into the broadening moonlight. 
               They saw all this-the gratified man, and the astonished boy who had neither brain nor experience enough to make anything out of the whole proceeding. One of the two understood it all-how within that ten minutes there had been manufactured enough false witness to blast an unimpeachable character-how a deed more dastardly than his own dark soul could ever have conceived, had been successfully accomplished. But even he could scarcely have imagined, in advance, the words with which that shaking of the clenched fist towards the Wrecker's dwelling had been accompanied: 
               "Now, Barney North!-now, curse you! You have preached me a good many sermons about honesty and sobriety, and you have set more than one to suspectin' me! Wait a little bit, and we'll see if somebody else's character won't suffer a little, one of these days!" 
               Cain, when the shadow had once more disappeared from the window, glanced carefully around the corner of the out-house and saw that the manufacturer of false evidence was hurrying away by the same route by which he had approached-down the beach a little before striking across the marsh homeward. Then he came back to the spot where the shivering boy was standing, grasped him by the arm and hurried away with him over the marshes, westward: managing to say, and to be answered, as they floundered along:- 
               "Who was that you seen get into the window?" 
               "That was Mr. Davis-I knowed him in a minute!" The boy had not been so frightened as to make him misty with reference to the personality of the man who had flogged him so often and cursed and starved him so continually! 
               "Are you sure?" This was accompanied by a threatening swing of the boy by the arm, to save him from one of those ever recurring pond-holes. 
               "Please don't kill me, Mr. Cain! that was Mr. Davis; I knowed him the minute I seed him get into the window." 
               "Humph! and what did you see Mr. Davis do?" 
               "Seen him have a lot of them things off the beach-things like what we took the load for pony out of, to-night." 
               "Very well!-now what did you see him do with them?" 
               "Seen him stick 'em away behind the fish nets, and then shake his fist at somethin', as he does at me sometimes before he licks me, mutterin' bad words at Barney North; and then I seen him get out of the window and go away again." 
               The boy was very clear, as it seemed to Cain, who was quite satisfied. Not so poor little Nink himself, who had recovered from the extremity of his terror as they increased their distance from the dead-house, and who was not too entirely an abused underling to possess that commonest of foibles-curiosity. 
                
               "What did he do that for, Mr. Cain?" 
               "What business is that of yours, you whelp?" They were for the moment on a piece of firm ground, and Cain took advantage of the footing to grasp Nink by the arm with a grip which could not fail to pain him-to turn his face round again to the moonlight and stick the fore finger of his right hand very nearly into the boy's eyes, as he said." Now see here-I told you that I wouldn't kill you if you minded me. You have done it so far. Pretty well. Don't go for to make me kill you yet. If you say one word or ask one more question about what you have seen to-night, or about our going to Barney North's at all, until I tell you-look out! And mind that you don't forget anything that you did see! Think it over o' nights when you go to bed too airly-it will be good for you! Do you hear what I say?-are you again to mind me?" 
               "Yess'r, I won't say one word-not never to nobody-if you'll only please not kill me!" 
               "That'll do-now hurry along!" And along they went, splashing over the wet marshes and losing very little time by any variation from the right direction for the sake of better footing. Whatever deficiency was apparent in the short legs of Nink, for mud and water, was quite made up by the long legs and swinging arms of Cain, and so the two progressed rapidly. All this, which has taken so long a time in narration, occupied but little in reality; and very soon after Tom Wolf reached the hostelrie with the sedge-pony and its wagon-load of valuables, and some time before Gil Davis arrived at it from his longer detour to guard more effectually against detection,-Cain and his companion were on the spot, not much more muddy than the others, and certainly free from any suspicion of how far they had travelled and what they had witnessed. But what material poor little Nink had accumulated, for "thinkin' over o' nights," and how he was likely to enjoy the operation, may readily be imagined! 
             
             
               CHAPTER IX. 
               BLACK SILK AND A SUSPICION. 
               THE daybreak of the next morning after the scenes which have been detailed at such unavoidable length, brought crowds of the shoremen from Topsail and the country lying on either side of it, to the beach, provided with ropes, boat-hooks and other conveniences for drawing ashore the bodies of the dead and saving the property that might still be within reach of their sturdy efforts. For the first time since he had lived upon the coast, Barnard North was not among them, leading in the work of duty. He sat alone and absorbed, most of that day, in one of the little upper rooms of his cottage-alone, except when Rachael North, crazed, it seemed, by her bereavement, would break in upon him with loud cries after the son who could not be given back to her, and heart-broken reproaches against her husband for having forced him to death. 
               Strange-that action of the wife to which reference has before been made,-again renewed and even redoubled. Strange, that in that hour of deep and terrible affliction, which in so many cases seems the means ordained of heaven for once more bringing together those who has been temporarily separated in heart,-these two who had always borne so patiently with each other and lived so many years of happy life in each other,-should now be driven apart by so bitter an antagonism. Yet so it was. The heart that could not fear, could suffer, in its own blind way, but none the less acutely because every pulse-beat was not painfully analysed. Barnard North's heart of loving content had been put upon the rack on the previous day, and an injury done that time could give little hope of repairing: that day it seemed as if the last tension was to be demanded of it. Words were then spoken by the bereaved mother, which, if those of the previous day had embittered, now appeared to turn to very gall the heart of the Wrecker; and fierce replies were given, such as a woman seldom forgives or forgets from one whose tones have ever been kind to her. 
               But for the moment it is necessary to leave the wretched husband and his madly-grieving wife, between whom there seemed to have opened a door of unhappiness not likely ever to close again, and between whom there certainly had been established a breach of full confidence which was destined before many days to work the most disastrous consequences. 
               Some twenty bodies were taken from the fragments of the wreck, by the shoremen, and laid at length upon the beach; while others were engaged in removing as fast as possible out of the reach of the waves, the property which had been cast ashore or lay rolling and crashing in the slowly abating surf. All this latter was piled in heaps on the edge of the sandy bluff, under the direction of the District Inspector, who had by that time arrived to take it in charge and look after the interests of the underwriters. 
               It was observed, then, and freely commented upon-that many boxes and packages were lying along the shore, which had evidently been broken open and the goods extracted from them by some other hand than the viewless one of the sea. A general sentiment of indignation against the wretches who could have been guilty of the outrage was of course expressed; and none were more hearty in their condemnations, as may well be supposed, than Gil Davis and his associates of the groggery under the edge of the woods, who had so managed their arrangements in the present instance as to escape the very shadow of suspicion. It was generally voted (from some apparent clues which Davis and the other actual culprits ingeniously furnished without appearing to do so) that the people of the immediate coast were not responsible for the crime, and that it lay at the door of some of the reprobates from the "Swamp," a lawless section lying some dozen of miles below, who probably were all the while likely to go to judgement with quite enough sins of their own upon their shoulders, without any such additional imputation. 
               The Coroner of Seaboard County had meanwhile arrived, and proceeded to hold an inquest on the bodies there lying, as well as upon those which were removed from the out-house of Barnard North for examination. The inquest was merely formal, except as to any papers on the persons of the deceased which could possibly throw any light upon their personality, or any valuables in their possession. There was not, thank God!-in that instance any occasion for the legal authorities to investigate, as they have been obliged to do so many times, whether the vessels had been wrecked by stress of weather against which no human hand could battle, or whether one or both had been wantonly cast away by a hired captain, to recover a heavy amount of over-insurance, and every dead man of the wreck foully murdered! Such things have been seen on that very coast: he who writes has seen the dead lie in windows along the shore, from such an act, and the miserable wretch narrowly escaping the doom he had himself prepared for others, coming ashore in the lifeboat, half-drowned, unsuspected then by the surfmen who would have knocked him in the head like a dog if they could have known the horrible truth afterwards developed, and escaping to bear the brand of three hundred wanton murders ever thereafter upon his brow, whereas the fearfully-punished first homicide only bore the brand of one! In the instance under notice the hand of God had been too evident in a storm the violence of which outran all human memory, to make any enquiry necessary as to what the hand of man could or could not have done; and the investigation was narrowed down to the few points before indicated. Some questions were naturally asked of Barnard North as to those bodies which had been taken from the wreck of the first day, and the Wrecker choked out through his clenched teeth the little information it was in his power to render. He answered like one who had no interest in the matter-like one who would have felt no concern if a whole world, instead of a mere, matter of twenty or thirty men, had been drowned on that coast the day before! 
               The verdict was rendered, and preparations were made for the removal of the bodies and their burial in that churchyard with its long row of willows weeping over the dead, where were already entombed so many of the victims of the coast that the place had become a horror throughout the whole country-side. Carpenters had been at work since early morning, when information of the wrecks had reached the hamlets and villages lying farther away from the coast; and by the time when the inquest was concluded, there came rumbling down the lanes some of the ghastliest wagon-loads that ever made a sensitive man or a timid woman turn away the eyes in uncontrollable horror. No-not the ghastliest; for that superlative is to be found in a freight of human bodies, picked up one by one from the surf of a winter sea, some of the eyes gouged out by boat-hooks in the effort to recover them, some of the features gnawed away by fishes and some of the limbs bruised to blackness by beating among the floating wreek-timber,-all piled in, frozen and stark, one on the top of the other until the fearful load is completed, and carted away to the dead-house for examination. This is the superlative of the ghastly; next to it is that which that morning on the Topsail shore exhibited-load upon load of pine coffins! Not one coffin, in which to bury a loved one "out of our sight;" not even one humble and cheap-made box, in which a single pauper is to be carried to the first quiet repose known since his birth; but a dozen of these crudely-suggestive terrors of the carpenter's hand, piled up like bales of hay upon a wagon, and that dozen succeeded by another and yet another, and all with the remnants of humanity lying in one sad heap, waiting to fill them! 
               In those pine coffins, the examination over, the victims were laid away, with little preparation for the grave but tenderly as time and the occasion permitted. There is no necessity of following them to the churchyard, where during the same afternoon all the victims of both wrecks, whose bodies had been washed ashore and recovered, were buried, with that large concourse of people in attendance which is inevitable in country or city when something more than usually terrible has appealed to the general sympathy, and with the same simple but solemn funeral service over all-quite enough for all as for each, if the Protestant doctrine be true that" as the tree falls; so it lies;" and following the Catholic system of comprehensively embracing all in one, if the dogma of that church of benefiting the dead by services held in their behalf, is to be received as trustworthy. 
               One incident of that terrible morning which witnessed the removal and sepulture of the victims of the wreck, may serve at least partially to illustrate the madness of grief under which Rachael North, the mother so suddenly and so awfully bereaved, was laboring. When the first wagon with its ghastly load of pine coffins drove down the causeway to the spot near the house, where the inquest had been held,-the maddened mother rushed out from the door of the cottage, heedless of the hands that would have held her back-stood for a moment outside, silent, but her form convulsed and her face glowering with a feeling that seemed to be rage almost as much as grief-then put her hands to her head, brushing back her hair as if trying to clear away some mist that clouded her memory, and broke out with a wailing voice; 
               "Pine coffins! only to think-pine coffins! Have they nothing better than a pine coffin to bury my child-my Robert, in?" Then the recollection of her still worse bereavement seemed to come back. "Pine coffins? oh, Father in heaven, no!-he has no coffin! no coffin! My poor unburied boy is beating about through all the wide sea! Oh, Barnard North, why did you take him away from me and kill him? My Robert!-my Robert:-oh, what will become of me!" 
               Clasping her hands still more frantically to her head, she disappeared again from the eyes of the sympathizing neighbors, within the cottage, as the wagons drove on,-and was seen no more for the time. But within occurred another fearful tempest of upbraiding, impossible to convey in words or imagine in feelings, falling upon ears that seemed to be stone and yet completing a more ruinous effect than might have been evidenced by a less stolid reception. 
               The second day after the storm saw none of its marks left upon that section of shore, except the beaten sand-banks over the beach, a few broken timbers strewing it above high-water mark, and the shattered casks and boxes which had not yet been gathered for fuel by the inhabitants. So passed from the face of nature, but not from agonised memory, the terrible catastrophe of the twenty-fifth of September, 18-. Old men yet speak of it as the fiercest gale that has blown on the Northern coast within a century, and of more dead bodies having strewn the coast and the face of the North Atlantic, on the morning that followed that fatal day, than after any other one storm known to memory. 
               And not so faded away its recollection in the house of Barnard North, which it had so fearfully desolated by a single blow. 
               Thomas Hillyer, the supercargo, saved at so fearful a price to the Wrecker, had so far recovered, three days afterward, as to be able to leave the coast for the Northern port to which he had been originally bound; expressing, as he went away, a world of thanks, which seemed to flow from the most grateful of hearts, not only for the perilous courage which had saved him from drowning amid the broken timbers of the America, but for that assiduous nursing which had been so instrumental in bringing about his early recovery from weakness and debility. If anything could have consoled Rachael North in the early days of her terrible grief, or tempered down that grief to the level of ordinary human feeling,-it would have been the knowledge that while one life had been lost, another had been gained, coupled with the pleasant impression made upon her guileless heart by the intelligent conversation and the sympathy of the supercargo. The handsome and apparently manly fellow had made an equally favorable impression on the absorbed Wrecker and the younger members of the family, and especially upon poor little weak and confiding Charlotte, who had probably never before seen, in her life on the coast, any specimen of humanity better calculated to captivate her girlish fancy, than one of the rough pea-jacketed scions of wrecking and fish-house aristocracy, redolent of sea air and homely mischief, and the very reverse of romantic in every particular. Not even grief had power to seal the eyes of the young girl to the good looks of a man so much above the level of those whom she was in the habit of beholding, or her cars to the skilfully modulated accents of one who had conversed with women in countries so far away that she did not even know their names,-particularly when that man looked at her with such gratitude and affection, and spoke such soft, pleasant words as must have won their way to a much less unsophisticated heart. It was quite a gleam of pleasure to all,-the promise of the supercargo that some day he would come back to the coast and see the family of his preserver-a whole family of his preservers, he pointedly called them-that if the settlement of the business of the lost ship should afford him the opportunity, not many days might elapse before he should be with them once more. And so Thomas Hillyer went away. 
               But the place of the absent man was supplied, and more than supplied, in the neighborhood of Topsail beach, on the very day of his departure; and in the advent of the new comers a series of occurrences were inaugurated, not foreshadowed even by the calamities already fallen upon that devoted section of the Atlantic coast. 
               Martin Hawkins, Agent of the Board of Underwriters, came down from the city at that period, charged with looking after so much of the cargo of the wrecked ship as had been drawn ashore or might still lie within the possibility of being saved. A tall dark man, with heavy beetling eyebrows gray as the hair which showed him to be somewhat past the middle of life; and with the eyes under those brows ever peering out with a keenness which made villainy tremble, and a promise of cruelty towards any man accused, which might well make even innocence uneasy. The most valuable, because the most indefatigable and perhaps the most unscrupulous of all the wrecking agents-well known on many a mile of sea-coast, though he had never before chanced to have occasion for visiting Topsail beach; and a man for the indefinite continuance of whose life the Board of Underwriters, could they have been called upon with such a demand, would probably have dipped their close hands into vaults and money-chests and counted down half a million of dollars at any moment. A ferret of keenness, a bloodhound of determination, a tiger of cruel steadiness of purpose and insulting disbelief in the virtue of any man when sufficiently tempted. 
               But the Agent did not come down to the coast alone. The then President of the Board of Underwriters, Howland Denniston, a man who has long since gone to an account which few could meet with less tremor in view of the actions of a whole prosperous life,-had an only and darling son, twenty, just through his last year at one of the Eastern colleges, and not yet entered upon the mercantile career which was to supply him with respectability and occupation while enjoying and doubling the piled thousands of the doting father. And certainly the old President had ground for all the partiality which he manifested, apart from the close tie of blood; for a nobler fellow than Charley Denniston (no one ever thought of calling him by a more formal name, even when a respectful prefix was supplied)-a nobler, more thoroughly unspoiled, warmer-hearted or cleverer fellow in any regard could not have been found by sweeping every counting-house and drawing-room in which clustered the mercantile aristocracy of the great city. 
               He was very handsome, to any moderately-observant eye, with his erect and well-rounded figure, verging towards six feet and promising to be stout in its proportions before he should reach forty-with his laughing eye of hazel, that could yet assume a shadow of feeling and melancholy at very slight provocation-his full but well cut features, with as yet only a suspicion of the beard that was some day to hide half of them away-and his head of clustering dark-brown curls that made every female finger tingle to be playing among them, even when there was no knowledge of the rich quality of the pillow upon which they nightly rested. Very handsome:-there are yet old people on that coast who remember the first day when Charley Denniston came down, and who yet speak of him as having been the very embodiment of boyish grace just ripening into the full glory of manhood. They lived to see him-well, what they lived to see of him lies with the later portions of a story that is as yet only in its beginning. 
               The young man, "between hay and grass," as they country people say of anything in a transition state-between the "grass" of educational boyhood and the "hay" ripened in the sun of personal experience in the world,-had asked permission to accompany the Agent on his visit to the sea-shore, and that permission had been accorded by a parent at once too wise and too indulgent to wish an undue restraint held over him. He came with Hawkins to the coast, and thus-so much may be said without any infringement of those unities which exclusively belong to the future in narration-thus shaped the whole course of his coming life, besides preparing to exercise an influence upon others, of which he as little dreamed as one of the senseless timbers beating in the surf from the wreck of the lost America. 
               It will be remembered that on the morning after the wreck of that vessel, the fragments of a considerable number of packages had been seen upon the beach-those packages having evidently been opened by hands more discriminating than the cold wet fingers of the sea. To the reader of this chain of events it is no marvel that such should have been the case, the groggery of Gil Davis being borne in mind; but to the shoremen of Topsail there was something more of disgraceful mystery involved. At first it had been believed that the robbers were transient visitors from the coast below; afterwards, circumstances seemed to point in a very different direction. 
               There probably never was a section of country five miles square, without at least one resident as anxious to display all its unpleasant features before the eyes of an expectant world, as any vinegarish old maid could be to bring into strong relief the foibles and follies of all the different persons in an evening assembly into which she chanced to be thrown. Seaboard country certainly furnished no reason to doubt the generality of the rule. It had its gossips then-male and female; it has them to-day; and the last person upon whom the rocks and mountains of final indignation will fall, are likely to be those who constantly avenge humanity upon itself by making a parade of its vices. 
               In one single person, had there been no other disposed to look after the "fouling of the nest" of sectional reputation, the village of Topsail would have been abundantly able to hold up its head with all the rest of the world. At the lower or south end of its somewhat irregular and straggling street of half a mile, almost immediately opposite the "Eagle Tavern,"-stood the shoe-shop and house adjoining, of Major Jeff Taddle-wick-a "character," if character there could be where character was none. He was a little fellow, counted by the inches of his altitude, but a big fellow when the dimensions of his protuberant stomach were taken into account; with a gray eye that better knew how to peer into the business of others than to look after the interests of his own cobbler's bench; a nose Roman enough to make those who did not know him believe that he might be courageous, and setting far enough out from his face to smell anything disgraceful afar off; and hair grown grey as the badger long before forty, solely, as those who best understood him had reason to believe, from the acid of his jealous disposition striking out to the skin and blanching the hair in that somewhat remarkable manner. For the twenty years preceding there had scarcely been a scandal, affecting property or character, within the bound of a dozen miles, the foundation of which, or some important portion of the superstructure, had not eventually been traced to Major Jeff Taddlewick; and his character in that regard had already become so well established that the residents of the village and the bluff shoremen who every day came up to make its floating population, would probably have been tempted to rid themselves of him by some act of pardonable lynch-law, calling for a rail from one of the fences, a gallon of tar from the tar-barrel at the "store," and the wild-goose feathers from some "best room" bolster,-but that the scurvy fellow really had the art (when he would work) of making a shoe of unimpeachable fit, and that he could tell one of his injurious stories so wittily and well as to cover up the poison under what seemed to be very delicious sugar. 
               Major Jeff, as a consequence of this last pleasant peculiarity of his disposition, was not only endured but actually popular among a considerable class of society-the more so because he always dressed well and always pushed himself forward in any public business with the air of one who knew that without him literally nothing could be done to advantage. In the years preceding, the old militia system, which involved "general trainings" and the existence of innumerable ununiformed "slab companies," had been in vogue: Jeff had figured therein to great prominence, and come out with the rank of Major, while he did not know enough of military science to march a company into the field without blundering them against some gate-post, and while he was so miserable a coward as to have twice signed acknowledgements of libels to escape prosecution for the utterance of them, and oftener than twice fallen on his knees and begged like an abject poltroon when threatened with personal chastisement for invading the peace of a family. 
               Such was Major Jeff Taddlewick, of whom perhaps too much has already been said, as referring to one only destined to occasional prominence in this relation,-but who cannot lightly be passed over, when occasion arises to name him at all, any more than the faithful surveyor of a line of sea-coast can fail to report and buoy a sunken rock on which many vessels have already made wreck and many more may meet the same destruction in the future. 
               Of course no event like that of the wreck of the America could take place in the immediate neighborhood of the redoubtable militia Major, without his taking part in the proceedings which followed, to precisely such an extent as involved no outlay of money or personal exertion whatever; and among the earliest of those who visited the scene of the disaster after the storm was over and when there was not even peril of a wet foot, could be seen his pompous figure, strutting about with the air of being proprietor not only of the wrecked vessel but the whole line of coast where she lay. No one could offer so many suggestions of what ought to be done, without touching a finger to carry out one of them; and no eye (and it may be said no nose) peered so curiously at the broken packages which were found strewing the beach after the theft of Gil Davis and his comrades. How that man itched to bring the culprits to punishment, from the moment when he made the discovery-not by any means because he wished to subserve the ends of justice and make the coast more honest and respectable, but because every discovered crime was a fragrant new scandal upon humanity and lowered the average to nearer his own moral level! How ill he rested for a night or two thereafter; and how eagerly, when Hawkins the agent came down, he seized upon the opportunity to force an introduction to him before he had quite finished his hurried dinner at the "Eagle Tavern," and to draw him out to one corner of the tavern porch, with the air of a man who had the most important of diplomatic intelligence to make known! How he whittled a soft pine stick while he communicated the astounding information of the evident robbery; and with what a grace and adroitness he managed to convey the impression that the robbery was four times as extensive as it had really been, and that such villainies were the rule on that part of the coast, instead of being, as they really were, the miserable exception! 
               But contemptible as was the channel through which the information came to Hawkins, it none the less produced a marked effect upon his mind; and when he saw with his own eyes that robbery had really been committed, the hard, stern nature of the man was ready for any amount of investigation and any extent of cruel punishment to be meted out to the culprits if he should have the good fortune to discover them. 
               Then came an intimation to the ears of the Agent-from what quarter no one could well discover,-that the depredators had not been, as at first supposed, people from any distant section-that the stain of theft was upon some of the hands best known on that very beach of Topsail. Then, narrowing down still closer, the charge came in whispers from mouth to ear and found its way to the Agent, that the crime had been committed by Barnard North! Blindly as that charge came to him, it may not be difficult for the reader to imagine whence the information proceeded (for once, not from Major Jeff Taddlewick); for the malice which could have placed the false proofs of guilt in the Wrecker's possession, would not have been likely to rest without making them available. None of the better class of the shoremen heard the charge, as it would notoriously have been unsafe for the man who uttered such an insinuation in their presence; but it came to the ears of some of the female members of their families, and the dishonest and the inveterately gossiping alike pretended to believe what they could make themselves happier by believing. The hint came to Hawkins, as has been suggested; and a stranger to the Wrecker and holding none of that personal knowledge of his character which could have given the lie to the charge the moment made, he could only suppose it true and act upon that supposition. 
               It is very possible, meanwhile, that some of the stolen goods actually were in the house of Barnard North, little as he or any member of his family suspected the fact. Itinerant hawkers often traversed the section, selling cheap goods even lower than the village stores could afford to supply them, and occasionally blending with plated jewelry, calicoes, handkerchiefs and delaine dress-patterns, richer and costlier fabrics offered at such prices that the honesty of their attainment might well have been suspected. Some of those hawkers were in the neighborhood, only two or three days after the wreck, and silks formed a considerable portion of their stock in trade. These silks may have formed, as it was afterwards suspected that they really did form, a part of the cargo of the wrecked America. 
               When the fiend of malevolence and injustice temporarily assumes the direction of a chain of succeeding events, he does not often lack for opportunity to carry out the very worst of his aspirations. Human actions take place at his beck, precisely as the master-spirit would specially desire; and accident, folly, omission-all work together to furnish him the warp into which he may weave what infernal woof he pleases. The base calumny of Gil Davis might have been without effect, or worked only a partial injury, had not a corroboration been blindly supplied. None of the family of Barnard North were in the habit of wearing black at the death of friends; but when, so soon after the terrible bereavement of the death of Robert, one of those hawkers made his appearance at the cottage and offered, among other goods, black silks at prices which brought them but little above the cost of commoner cotton or worsted, the wretched mother seems to have felt that it would be some poor mitigation of her sorrow for her lost son, to show that sorrow in her outward appearance; and before the pedlar went away she had purchased enough of those silks to wrap her own stately form and the daintier limbs of little Charlotte, in the very garb of woe. Nothing was known by the husband of this purchase, owing to that partial derangement of grief which had made the two, always so closely bound in love and confidence, almost strangers to each other. 
               Then it so happened that one or two of the gossiping people from the village of Topsail, calling on some errand of business or condolence, had seen this silk in the process of making up, in the hands of Rachael North and her daughter; and it needed but a few hours to connect that fact with the known theft of goods from the shore, and to forge those whispers and innuendos which could blast a character as quickly and effectually as the red lightning shivers and slays the monarch pine of the woods. No one had ever known a dishonorable action of Barnard North-all had held him in the very highest esteem-he had been, as must by this time be fully understood, the very idol of the shoremen and the pride of the coast: but what character is beyond the reach of suspicion, at one time or another, while man remains corrupt and society malicious? 
             
             
               CHAPTER X. 
               TWO WARRANTS AND ONE ARREST. 
               MARTIN HAWKINS, Insurance Agent, was not the man to do things by halves, slowly, or with any marked circumspection. Charley Denniston, his companion, was a companion only and had no position entitling him to be an adviser. The blended poisons of Gil Davis and Major Jeff Taddlewick worked finely in his mental system; and the result was that before noon on the day following his arrival upon the coast and the communication of these suspicions, he had wrung out of Squire Billy Holloway, storekeeper and resident magistrate at Topsail, a general search-warrant to look after stolen property in the houses along the coast, and made his first appearance at the cottage of Barnard North, accompanied by a constable and by Charley Denniston, the later of whom had no reason to believe otherwise than that he was to see high-handed crime punished and a check administered to those shore robberies which had so seriously defrauded his father and the other members of the Board of Underwriters. 
               The visit was certainly paid at a most inopportune time. They found the Wrecker sitting alone in the outer room of his cottage, when the knock of Hawkins at the door had been answered by a hoarse and forbidding order to "Come in!"-alone, and idle, as Barnard North was not in the habit of being, under any ordinary circumstances. There was a piece of fishing-net depending from a nail by one of the windows, and he held in his hand one of the wooden needles employed in knitting that coarse-meshed trap for the finny inhabitants of Topsail inlet; but the hands were idle, nevertheless, and the eyes of the tortured man seemed to be staring into vacancy. There was not keenness enough in any of those which looked upon him, to discover the terrible suffering that lay in that hard countenance; and there were even some of them blind enough to believe that what they saw was the expression of frightened guilt! Frightened guilt, for him!-for Barnard North, whose soul was as free from guile as the salt sea-breeze from infection when it blew every day upon his bared brow!-who had perhaps never known the shame of even a momentary fright, since the day when he first donned the short jacket of boyhood! 
               But-heaven bless the young and the pure for a keenness of vision so often denied to those who are more hackneyed in the ways of the world!-there was an eye that saw the truth of the Wrecker's character, at a single glance. From the moment when Charley Denniston looked upon the stalwart form and the face that seemed so majestic in its trouble, truth answered to truth, and there was no power less potent than that of heaven itself, which could thenceforward have convinced him that the man who sat before him was a thief and a robber! From that moment he knew and understood him, knew the wrong that had been done in the accusation, and the yet more terrible wrong that was being done by this domiciliary visit. But what could he do?-what could he say?-he who was only there unnamed and upon mere sufferance? 
               Roughly and rudely the Agent opened his business. A prudent man, even seeing only what he saw, and knowing only what he knew, would have spoken and acted differently. 
               "Your name is Barnard North, they tell me," was his abrupt and uncourteous salutation. 
               "My name is Barnard North. What do you want with it?" This without rising, and without any tender of hospitality, while the voice was hoarse and harsh, and the bowed head half raised itself without the eyes giving out any of the pleasant light of other days. "My name is Barnard North-I haven't any reason to be ashamed of it, that I know!" 
               "That is as may be proved!" said the imprudent Agent, with a very perceptible sneer in his tone. "I am here to look after that very matter!" 
               "Please, Mr. Hawkins, don't speak so roughly!" Charley Denniston opened his lips to say, but he was young and bashful, and he did not speak the words they syllabled. 
               "After me?" cried the Wrecker, his old energy seeming to flash up for a moment, and his giant height rising from the chair, until he stood half a head above the tallest of the others. "After me! Man, do you know what you are saying?" 
               "Perfectly, Mr. Barnard North!" quite as insolently answered the Agent, who was not in any degree overawed by the threatening stature. "I have been credibly informed that you have in this house some of the stolen goods from the ship America; and my employers and myself are determined to ferret out this outrage, and punish all who have taken any part in it! Constable, show your warrant!" 
               The constable, a poor nobody, who had been elected to the office at the preceding town-meeting, because it was worth nothing, and no one else would accept of it,-held up the paper, though with a hand that trembled not a little. He had not liked the business from the first: he liked it still less when the Wrecker stood upright in that angry majesty. 
               "I with stolen goods in my house!" cried the Wrecker, with fearful earnestness. "By the Lord, man, you are saying what may cost you more than you know! This is the first time that any man has ever made such an accusation against me, and no man shall make it and not repent it." 
               "We shall see!" was the reply of Hawkins, again in a sneer. To do him justice, he did not at all know the man he was outraging, or intend to commit any wrong. The saving of the life of the supercargo by the man who stood before him-the loss of his eldest son in the rescue-all, by some strange chance or the propensity of humanity to communicate the evil and conceal the good, had remained unknown to him. 
               But here young Charley Denniston managed to regain his half-lost power of utterance, and more and more impressed with the truth that a great wrong was being done, began to say to the Agent, in a low voice: 
               "Mr. Hawkins, are you sure that there is not some mistake here? This gentleman never could-" 
               Making threatening advances to a tiger-cat at feeding time, and meddling with Martin Hawkins when in the line of his "duty," were two things of very nearly the same peril. There was very little of the respect due the son of his leading employer, in the tone with which he replied to the half-uttered remonstrance: 
               "Mr. Denniston, this is my business, not yours! I know what I am about!" 
               "If I should serve you right, I would beat you out of my door like a hound; but I can wait!" said North, between his clench- ed teeth. "What are those stolen goods? Out with it, before I choke you!" 
               "Silks," was the sententious reply of the Agent. 
               "Silks in my house, and silks from that ship, above all others in the world!" exclaimed Barnard North, in a tone that curiously mingled sorrow, contempt and anger. "Here-search the house! Rachael North, here, open the doors, every one of them, and tumble out everything! Let these men search the house for stolen silks!" He took two hasty strides towards the middle door, and was about to lay his hand upon the latch. 
               The noise of the altercation had been heard in the inner room, but the words had not been understood. At the sudden and violent call of the husband Rachael North threw open the door, just as he laid his hand upon it, and appeared in the passage, a half-finished dress of black silk in her hand; and in the back part of the room appeared little Charlotte, rising frightened from her chair, dropping from her lap another uncompleted garment of the same material. 
               The Wrecker staggered back with such an imprecation as had not crossed his lips half a dozen times in the preceding twenty years-staggered back as if he had been met by a blow from within. 
               "Silks!-it seems that you have plenty of them, and new ones, in your house!" said the Agent, in his sneering tone and grasping at the piece in Rachael's hands. "What are these, I should like to know!" Young Charley Denniston felt, at the instant, as if all his budding faith in humanity was blighted, never to revive again. Others, with the same youth in their veins and the same sudden disenchantment forced upon them, have a felt their faith shivered, like him; but thank God, again, that the growth thus stricken is that of an evergreen! 
               "Look like silks, and feel like 'em!" was the short comment of the constable, who had probably never before touched a yard of silk in his life. 
               "Woman!" cried the Wrecker, sharply-"where did you get that cursed stuff? Quick, out with it, before I do some mischief to myself or some one else!" 
               "Yes, woman-probably you can tell a readier story than he!" again sneered Hawkins, with a look at the officer which proclaimed that all humanity were scoundrels and he knew it, and with a cross-glance at young Denniston calculated to make that juvenile person ashamed of ever trusting any one during the whole course of his natural life. Barnard North lifted his hand with a quick motion that portended violence, but he forbore and no one observed it. 
               "Speak, woman!" again he thundered hoarsely. 
               "I-I bought it," was the surprised and faltering answer of Rachael North, whose confused and frightened manner might well have been mistaken for guilt by a keener observer than Martin Hawkins. 
               "Of course you did!" again sneered that unwarned man. 
               This was the "drop too much," and in an instant the heavy hand of Barnard North struck him in the side of the head with a force that might have felled an ox. Perhaps he had never before struck mortal man in anger (at least there were none on the coast who had ever known such a display of passion), but the restrained anger was terrible when it once broke loose, and the concentrated fury of years might have been in that blow. Hawkins went down to the floor, senseless as a steer before the butcher's axe. Rachael North and her daughter screamed with affright and fled away into the back corner of the inner room. The officer, with a momentary flash of courage, sprang forward to protect his employer, and grasped Barnard North by the arm. In an instant he, too, lay senseless upon the floor, prostrated by a much lighter blow; and in a moment more the Wrecker hauled them both out of the door as if they had been children, and closed it. Not till then did Dennison move, and not till then did the violent man seem to recognize that there was yet one of his visitors remaining within. When he did take in that knowledge he said: 
               "What do you want? Are you searching, too?" 
               "No-I came with Mr. Hawkins, but I have nothing to do with his errand," was the reply, after one instant of hesitation. "I am sure that they were wrong, and that you have only done right in defending your house and family." 
               "Indeed!" queried the Wrecker, who did not seem to be capable of comprehending, at that moment that any one could do him justice. 
               "Yes-can I do anything for you?" enquired the young man, in answer. 
               "Anything for me? No-you had better go!" said the Wrecker; and taking one more pitying look around the room and at the two women who yet cowered within with their faces covered by their hands, Charley Dennison opened the door and stepped out over the still prostrate bodies of his late companions. A moment or two of apparently troubled thought, and then with the vigorous tread of youth he strode rapidly away, through the clear September air, towards the village which had been so lately quitted by the searching-party of which he was an "honorary member." 
               Within the house, when the moment of violence was over, that occurred which showed how seldom the hand of the Wrecker was employed in violence, and how far he was from ignoring the consequences likely to follow from resistance to the law. While the two women of his household still cowered in the corner, he staggered backward and sank down into his chair, a look of strange meaning on his face. 
               "Ruined! ruined! That was the last drop!" he said, in his hoarse voice; and then his head fell forward on his broad breast as if the neck had suddenly become too weak to uphold it. 
               Without the house, but a moment or two after the departure of Denniston, two persons might have been seen gradually recovering sensibility and rising from their recumbent position-one with a look of deadly rage upon his face that was well indicated by a shake of his clenched fist towards the house where his assaulter resided, and the other with a sort of puzzled expression on his countenance, as if he did not quite realize what had occurred and how he had come to be measuring his length upon the ground before Barnard North's door. 
               A few minutes later, they were once more in the conveyance which had brought them down, and making their way back towards the village, with few words passing between them, but those few principally expressions of fury from Hawkins against "all beach-pirates and d-d scoundrels generally," and promises from the same quarter that he would "have the life of that big two-fisted robber if he could not get satisfaction out of him in any other way." 
               Something in the manner of Squire Holloway, when applied to for the search-warrant, had impressed the Agent with a belief that the heart of the magistrate was far from being in any movement for searching the shore-cottages and making arrests of the shoremen. As a consequence, for the more important processes now demanded, another and less scrupulous magistrate was sought, at a somewhat greater distance, under the advice of the constable; and within two hours after the outrage, a force of several special constables, hired and impressed into the service and armed with full authority, were on their way back to Topsail beach to make the arrest of the Wrecker. It seemed probable, however, that the journey would be made in vain-that after the commission of so high-handed an offence against the majesty of the law, he had taken advantage of his thorough knowledge of the coast and escaped beyond the reach of justice. 
               The rumor of the attempted search and the assult had already spread for miles; and among those who accompanied the second party was Gil Davis, who sacrificed, in that instance, to the demands of the common weal, personal oversight over the business of his profitable groggery, and opportunities for inflicting personal chastisement upon poor little Nink, which might never be recovered. Some, even of this second party, doubted whether there must not be some mistake in the matter, and whether any proofs of Barnard North's guilt could really be found after all; it is only justice to Gil Davis to say that he believed they could!
                
               The apprehensions of the party were by no means realized-the Wrecker had not escaped or made any movement in that direction. When the party reached the house and opened the unfastened door, after an unanswered summons-they found him seated in the same chair into which he had fallen more than two hours before, as if he had not moved since the first encounter,-and his wife and children in hopeless alarm and misery around him. 
               There was no resistance whatever-none, at least, except the sobs of Rachael North, the almost childish wails and implorations of Charlotte that they would not "hurt her poor father, who was not well," and the clenched fists of young Barnard, who seemed to wish that some one would try to meddle with his personal liberty! The strong man submitted at once to his arrest for the double crime of piracy and assault upon an officer of the law. Something seemed to have gone out of heart and spirit, during the few days which had elapsed since the death of his son,-something more, even during the preceding two hours; and he wore a look, now, as if he regarded neither life, honor or liberty as worth battling for, even at the price of a single additional blow. 
               But this was not all. The silk was, of course, taken possession of in the name of the law; and Rachael North, who, after what had occurred, would as soon have worn a garment dipped in her husband's blood,-did not again repeat the story of its purchase. It may be said, here, that with her the second shock seemed to break the first, as is not unusual when troubles follow each other very closely-that in this disgrace and peril to a husband whom she had so long loved and honored, she partially forgot her mad grief for her son-returned, at least for the time, to herself, but too late.
                
               There was a whispering between the officers and some of the party; and while Barnard North remained under watch inside, still seated in his chair, and apparently altogether apathetic-a general search for any further evidences of guilt was ordered. It is not difficult to guess, again, who suggested an examination of the out-houses, not is it strange that Gil Davis directed the latter search, and that behind the nets in the outhouse were found the broken packages, with the trade marks yet upon them, which conclusively proved that the Wrecker had been one of the robbers of the ship America! 
               The packages were brought into the house, and the Wrecker was confronted with them, with an insulting demand upon him to explain away the presence of these convincing proofs of his dishonesty. 
               "Silks in your house, eh? What do these mean, you snarling old thief of a sea-dog!" thundered out Hawkins, still smarting under the blow he had received and gloating over the triumph that was now so certainly coming. 
               He glared sternly upon his tormentor, there was half a movement to rise from his chair and a gripping of the great hands that was unmistakable; then he sank sullenly back, and hoarsely hurled out a torrent of such bitter invective, mingled with furious curses, as no man had ever before heard pass his lips. Not only his accusers, but Rachael North and her children shrank away in fear, as if the husband and father had suddenly been taken away and some frozen demon of rage and hate set in his place. Then he closed his lips and answered no more. All who had before known him became aware that a fearful change had fallen upon him; but precisely what was that change, not the wisest of them could measure. Blow after blow had produced-what?-it might be partial insanity; it might be the crushing out of the active good of his nature beneath sorrow and wrong; it might be only the waking to life of an evil and rebellious principle which seems to lie, either dormant or in activity, within the breast of every man born since the headlong downfall of Lucifer. 
               A wagon, as before, had come down from the village, carrying Hawkins and the officers charged with the arrest. It was one of the open, lumbering vehicles of the country, drawn by two horses and furnishing alike to driver and riders the convenience of a hard board seat laid across from side to side, with a sheaf of rye straw spread in the bottom for carpet and baffalo-robe. Into this rough conveyance the Wrecker was trust, when the arrest had been fully made; and in it, without more than a frowning nod of the head and a hoarse "good-bye!" in reply to the sobs and lamentations of his family, Barnard North left his home for the country prison at Clayboro, some twenty miles away. Of the situation in which that family remained behind him, it is well that there is no occasion to speak in this connection, as there are some things of which the pen lacks power to write, and that hopeless, broken, helpless group would certainly task it beyond all propriety. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XI. 
               SQUIRE HOLLOWAY'S DAUGHTER. 
               IT will be remembered that Charley Denniston stepped rapidly away, over the bodies of his prostrate companions and from the cottage of Barnard North, towards the village of Topsail, the moment after the heavy hand of the Wrecker had felled both the Agent and the constable. It may well be doubted whether he had at the moment any definite plan, further than to seek some means of relief for the man whom he felt to have been so unjustly accused and placed in a peril which he had never deserved; but if he had not, a crude idea shaped itself into form before he had proceeded many paces, which he no doubt in after days believed to have been a direct emanation from the invisible but all-powerful influences. He had been present when Hawkins demanded the search-warrant from Squire Holloway and the latter issued it, at his own house at the village; and while the Agent had seen something in the face of the Squire which made him doubtful of the extent to which he could be counted upon in penal operations against the shoremen, Denniston had seen the same expression there, which he now remembered with pleasure and an assurance of assistance in what he meditated. 
               The young man knew so little of that law which he had never before had personal occasion to tempt, as to believe that what the hand of any official had done, the same hand could undo just as quickly. He would go to the good-natured Squire, make himself known as the son of the President of the Board of Underwriters in whose behalf Hawkins was acting, state that he had himself seen enough to make him sure that Barnard North could not have been guilty of the crime charged against him, and request that the warrant might be withdrawn, or another issued to a contrary effect, or at least something done which would prevent the now doubly-incensed Agent from pursuing him to his ruin. A boy's idea, of course, and one which the very commonest knowledge of law would have shown to be fallacious,-but one which reflected infinite credit upon the heart if it did not add to the reputation of the head. And perhaps, after all, the young man was not so far astray in legal science-only living a little before his time; for had he entered the arena twenty or thirty years later he would have found no difficulty in "blocking the wheels" of any proceeding, by an injunction, an injunction upon that injunction, an order to show cause why the injunction restraining the injunction should not be set aside, and still another order to show cause why that order to show cause should not be enjoined. Nay, if public report be not the most shameless of falsifiers, he might have found a high legal dignitary keeping so limited a recollection of the proceedings of a single day upon the bench, as to issue three conflicting orders and injunctions, all bearing upon the same matter and all within that very limited period! 
               But all this by the way. Young Charley Denniston strode on towards Topsail, intent upon his errand of benevolence, however that errand might militate against the wishes or the interests of that influential body the Board of Underwriters. 
                
               An old-fashioned, low-caved, dormer-windowed house of fair size, standing nearly in the middle of the village, and fronted on the street by a grove of large cherry trees from which two or three lofty poplars pointed up like church spires, while close behind and beyond the garden clustered a range of farm buildings that denoted at least moderate thrift and prosperity in the owner:-this was the residence of Squire Billy Holloway, and it was in one of the rooms of that house that the Squire had a few hours before given audience to Hawkins and his companion, and issued that paper which the latter was now so anxious to have withdrawn or invalidated. 
               The legal dignitary was not at home when the merchant's son made summons for him by two or three sharp raps on the heavy iron knocker that studded the wide panel-door with its two diagonal bulls-eyes squinting at the visitor from near its top. "He had gone to the store"-so said the redarmed but pleasant-faced "help" who came to answer the knock-"the store was over yonder, a little way up the street, where the wagon was tied" (she said the "wagon," making no allusion to the horses)-"they would send over for him, or the gentleman mought walk over to the store and see him hisself." Charley Denniston thought that he would walk over, and immediately proceeded to put that thought into execution. How little he knew, just then, what hung upon the question whether he should traverse that hundred yards of country road or permit it to be traversed for him by the feet of another-as little as young Endymion, scarcely fairer or more worthy the love of the dwellers on Olympus, knew that there was any special fate in store for him on that night when he first walked out into the sweet Carian woods, with the June roses making reply in fragrance to the song of the nightingale that wooed them,-walked out to meet that kiss of the moon which was ever after to fever while it immortalized his being. 
               The "store" (Anglice, "shop") of Squire Holloway, where meet the converging points of his three-fold character of merchant, farmer and jurist,-was a long, broad, low building, painted of a brick-dust red, standing on the opposite side of the road from the house and at the short distance already named,-with two fronts, the one on the main street being, by a singular perversion, never used, and the other, which boasted a stoop and half a dozen more or less rickety columns, opening on an insignificant cross-road that led down to some one of the shoreward sections. The discarded front had its uses, however. Out of it stared two dusty windows, and along it ran a rambling row of wooden posts gnawed into grotesque shapes by the teeth of the hungry horses that had been tied there while their owners transacted business within, any time during the previous quarter of a century. 
               Just then there was only a single conveyance near the line of posts-that one to which the "help" had called attention; and as he passed towards the corner the young man paused involuntarily at a spectacle which would then have commanded notice in any quarter of the continent, though the efforts of importers and breeders have before this time diminished its rarity. Two such horses as champed their bits and pawed the ground at one of the posts near the corner, harnessed before an open light-wagon with the wheels of a buggy and the body of a gig, had never before met his eye, even when admiring the most costly of the turn-outs of the old families, that drove up the Harlem road or down to the Battery of his native city. They were blacks, not less than seven-teen hands in height, glossy as the oft-instanced raven's wing, and without one fleck of white to mar the picture; bodies and limbs moulded in that rare and narrow line which ensures enduring strength and yet preserves the lightness and grace of the blooded racer; chests of immense weight, necks heavy at the base but tapering towards the head and so closely curbed that they seemed really to fill the Scripture image of being "clothed with thunder"; manes and tails of glossy black with a creeping wave just visible in their luxuriance; and eyes from which seemed to flash such fierce lightnings of fire as well agreed with the champed bits and told how rash would have been the stranger's hand suddenly laid upon flank or rein. So perfectly matched that no unpractised eye could possibly have distinguished the one from the other; each without a peer in a whole broad land unless the other supplied it; a pair worthy to have whirled the chariot in which Agamemnon himself dashed into the forest of Trojan swords and spears, or to have thundered over the trodden ground of the Olympic course with a queen holding the ribands of fluttering silk; what marvel that Charley Denniston paused for a moment in mingled astonishment and delight, to gaze upon what seemed the very master-work of God in the miscalled brute creation? 
               But the young man was intent upon an errand of benevolence, and not even those black friends of beauty could chain him long to the spot where they met his view. He shook off the spell of their presence with something like a sigh of relief, and passed on to the foot of the three or four steps which led up to the stoop, at the corner. But as he did so another surprise burst upon him, not less sudden than the first and likely to be much more enduring in its effects. A clear ringing burst of girlish laughter, not loud, but distinct enough to awaken all the echoes of the little village and set half the gossips to speculating on its impropriety, broke out at the moment and checked the progress of the young man quite as summarily as the spectacle of the horses had done. Then words followed, and while his eyes were taking in what they saw of a group at the door, he could no more have conquered the desire to listen momentarily than he could have found wings and outstripped the speed of the sable span at the corner. 
               "Why no, I don't want to laugh at you, Joe; but how can I help it?" he heard from the same girlish voice that had just indulged in the laughter. 
               "Well, I think you might-I don't see anything funny about it!" he heard replied, in a much gruffer voice but one that seemed strangely broken and affected by feeling. 
               "Are you going to keep on doing it?" queried the girl, laughter still in her tones though another outbreak was restrained. 
               "Yes, I s'pose so," was the reply, a sigh concluding the sentence. "I don't know, Letty, how many times this makes, that I have asked you to marry me-" 
               "Oh, I know," answered the girl, still nearer than before to another burst of laughter-"this makes thirteen, just as many as the baker leaves of loaves for a dozen." 
               "I don't know how long I may live," responded the man's voice, yet more broken, "but while I do I shall keep on asking you to be my wife, Letty Holloway; for I can't live without you, and you know it!" 
               "Joe-" the girl began in reply, but he interrupted her. 
               -"Don't say No, Letty-that is, not for good. You don't know what you might do-you might make a man of me, yet. I mean that you might keep me one, for I don't think that I've gone so far that I'm not a man-not so far that I couldn't come back for you!" 
               Lettice Holloway spoke again, but there was no suspicion of laughter in her tones, now! How instantly the softness of true womanhood had crept into them with the feeling that changed and deepened into seriousness,-until they thrilled the hearer with that sweetness which might have crept out and sobbed away on the air from a lightly-stricken harp-string! 
               "Joe Harrison-poor Joe!-I pity you, you know that I do, but I do not love you and cannot marry you. I could not save you if I did, for if you will not stop drinking after all I have said to you with the faithfulness of a sister you would not do it to please a wife." 
               "Wouldn't I, think? I don't know-I think I would; but maybe you are right and it is all for the best. I know that I am not good enough for you, Letty, but still-"How sad were the words!-how broken was the voice! 
               "Please don't say anything more about it, Joe, just now! Don't you see that there are people in the store, waiting for me? Good-bye!" 
               She put out her hand and the man took it, held it for one instant in his own, then dropped it, said "Good-bye!" and turned away. As he did so Charley Denniston for the first time caught a fair glance at his face; and as he passed from in front of her the same better opportunity was given for one moment's survey of the face and figure of the girl, before she became aware of the presence of a stranger or hurried away into the store to attend to her waiting customers. What the merchant's son saw at that moment, may supply that description necessary at this. 
               Strangely enough, it was the man whom he had heard addressed as Joe Harrison, claiming close attention even before the pretty and graceful girl to whom he had been repeating an offer of marriage in that most inappropriate of all places-the stoop of a country store. He was of middle height, with a figure that had been pleasing before dissipation brought unnatural, bloated fulness. His face must once have been handsome, with its clear, well-cut features, his fine dark hair and whiskers. But it had evidently always been weak, undecided about the mouth and unsteady in the eyes-true index of a character more likely to be led away from the path of rectitude than to keep it steadily. Now, though scarcely more than twenty-five years had passed over his head, the face was bloated like the figure, the entire surface of skin surcharged with a pink blood-flush, and inflamed red blotches here and there showing the still more fearful marks of ruin soon to overspread the whole countenance. The eyes were bloodshot and fiery, there was a painful trembling in the lips, and a glance downward showed that the hands had arrived at that pitiable state in which a filled tumbler could not possibly have been carried to the mouth without spilling half its contents. His clothes were dark colored and had been fashionable, but they were ill-cared-for and in disorder; his head covering was a drab jockey-cap entirely out of character with the style of the rest of his apparel; and in his hand he held a long whalebone driving-whip which he seemed to fondle and caress as if there would be an irreparable loss in its going out of his possession. 
               Poor Joe Harrison, possessor of the finest span of horses in Seaboard country, if not of the very finest then to be found in the State-it was a fearful picture of human ruin that he displayed; it was a melancholy type that he presented, of a class of men just at that period becoming more and more widely disseminated over the land. Born to broad acres and a handsome fortune, an unequalled horseman and with propensities for sporting for which his candor and confiding disposition made him peculiarly unfit, always weak and always generous,-he had been an orphan at fifteen, the pet and the victim of sharpers at eighteen, fast verging towards ruin of body and fortune at twenty-one; and at twenty-five he stood ruined without hope in body, a drunkard beyond the power of limiting his cups, or passing any one of the country taverns without stopping to pour into his inflamed system more of that liquid poison which was burning away body and soul; and with so many and such hopeless mortgages on the half-tilled lands which yet called him master, that there was never a financial Hercules bold enough to attempt their redemption. His passion for horses had never died away, any more than his power of managing the wildest of them when his hand was the worst unsteadied by liquor; and a heavy proportion of the ready money that came to him from one of his mortgages two or three years before, had been employed in purchasing that span of blacks, matchless in speed as in splendid beauty, so closely attracting the attention of Charley Denniston. They seemed to be one of the resources as well as one of the passions of his life. They never knew inattention or unkindness. His farm might be neglected, his creditors unpaid: Thunder and Lightning never went ungroomed, or lacked that provender which could keep them ready for the flying speed that he often exacted of them. "Joe Harrison's horses" were far better known over the county than any minister who attempted to preach the word of life to the perishing-almost as well known as the sheriff who haunted criminals and levied upon the property of the spendthrift and the unfortunate. Perhaps they aided to keep him alive through reckless exposures quite sufficient to sap the vital energies; without doubt they formed one of the links that bound him to life and the wreck of enjoyment. 
               One of the links, and yet not the only one or even the most powerful. Those few words which Charley Denniston overheard when spoken on the store piazza, revealed one of the secrets of the poor fellow's existence. Even more than he loved his horses and the reckless speed at which they could draw him, that human ruin loved Lettice Holloway-had loved her in other days when his proposals of marriage could not be regarded as so near a jest or an insult as now,-loved her just as madly now, after a dozen of refusals and when his sober sense told him that there could be no more chance of his winning her than of coaxing one of the stars to come down out of heaven and give light at his darkened fireside. The tenacity of his attachment would have been ridiculous if it had not been so melancholy: Letty laughed at each of his repeated proposals, as we have heard her do,-then softened into that true feeling which womanhood is not apt to withhold from the humblest of attachments to herself when it has proved its enduring truth; and not seldom she saw him drive away with a tear trembling in her dark eye and a wish bubbling up from heart to lips, that he had discovered the worth of body and soul before it grew too late-that she could have learned to regard him as he desired, and become the beacon to guide him onward to a better life. This was past praying for, now: Joe Harrison was traveling the downward road at a speed quite equal to that of Thunder and Lightning; and there seemed scarcely ever a pause except when for a few moments he stood in her presence, recalled the past, again proffered his hopeless suit, and passed away to relapse once more into the hopeless slough of the drunkard's wallowing. 
               Not all this, of course, was known to the young New Yorker, even after he had overheard the conversation between the two at the door; and he scarcely found time to make the physical observations inseparable from the appearance of such a man, when taken in connection with the words he had just heard spoken by both,-when Harrison slid from the stoop with a trembling step terribly in contrast with the athletic figure which he had evidently once possessed, glanced at the new comer with red and lack-lustre eye as he passed, then untied his horses with fingers that trembled visibly, threw himself into the wagon and dashed away, the long whip cracking and the magnificent creatures bounding beneath it, but the hand apparently as steady on the rein as if delirium tremens had not already been beginning to coil its snakes around the roots of his disordered hair. 
               And what else was it that the new-comer saw, when, the human wreck removed, he found full opportunity to look into the face and scan the form of Lettice Holloway? 
               A trim little shapely figure, bewitchingly small and rounded at the waist, but with fulness enough at hip and bosom to indicate healthy life and high girlish activity. A head of dark brown curls, "black in the shadow and brown in the sun," that had been played with by the September wind and tangled in the exigencies of her occupation, until it would have seemed alike a sin and an impossibility to comb them into any presentable shape. Eyes large, very dark, but welling mischief in every rising sparkle of light; lips rose-pink, pouting and full of temptation; nose short, decided, and with a slight tendency of the nostril to elevate itself into the retrouss; hands small, and the fingers taper, but a little soiled, temporarily, by some late employment; and a marvellously saucy little foot, in a thick-soled low shoe, coming out from beneath her short skirt as if it had no cause to be ashamed of itself and did not care who saw it. All this completed by a well-fitting dress of brown-and-white small plaided gingham, a pink calico apron with bordered pockets, and no ornament whatever except a pair of cunning little drop ear-rings, that seemed to have quite enough to do to avoid being irrecoverably lost in the wilderness of curls amid which they played bo-peep. Such was Lettice Holloway, destroyer of hearts at Top- sail village and for many a mile surrounding it; was it any wonder that poor soft-hearted, weak-brained Joe Harrison could not quite shake off the thrall but returned to his tormentor with all the blind devotion of the moth fluttering around his destroying candle? 
               Just as Harrison stepped to his wagon the young girl saw the new-comer and observed how intently his eyes were fixed upon her. Instantly the red blood flowed up to check and brow with the force of a torrent: it may have been because she believed that he might have heard a part of the singular conversation so lately concluded-it may have been because she saw the evident admiration in his eyes and observed how handsome were the eyes that expressed it. No one can quite answer for the compelling power of a young girl's blush: enough that she of all others has the privilege to display that heaven-ordained signal of modesty, without the right of any other to call its motive in question. 
               As for Charley Denniston, if he had paused in momentary admiration of Joe Harrison's horses, he had full warrant for standing speechless in the presence of youth, grace and beauty such as this so suddenly set before him. He was yet very young, and could no more command feeling or manifestation than check the flow of blood in his own bounding veins; ten or twenty years later, grown far less worthy the love of a virgin heart, he might have been able to school both, and look upon the most glorious creation of God's hand in womanhood as only worthy the patted applause to be bestowed upon an actor or the cold smile of approbation vouchsafed to a picture by some popular artist. 
               Knowing her, from her name, to be the daughter of the official of whom he was in search, it was the young man's intention to address her; but the eyes spoke instead of the lips and the latter were silent. Some time before he had sufficiently recovered himself to frame into words the enquiry he meant to utter, the blush upon the girl's face had given place to a smile compounded of pleasure and mischief (here was a handsome young fellow, more discomposed than herself at a first meeting, and that was something for the rural coquette!) and she had disappeared within the store, in response to a call which seemed to be imperative. After a moment or two spent in recovering his lost self-possession, the visitor followed, and to eyes accustomed only to such mercantile transactions as those of a great city, still a third spectacle was presented, scarcely less interesting than either of the others upon which he had stumbled while in search of a relenting magistrate. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XII. 
               CHARLEY DENNISTON AS A CHAMPION. 
               A long, low-ceilinged room, long even for its width, the rafters bare of plaster but nearly hidden in the strange fruit that clustered there, hanging from nails and pegs and covering them as if they had been branches of some great tree-the fruit curiously mixed of hams, wood-saws, water-pails, long fishermen's-boots, wash-boards, yellow tarpaulin coats and overalls, cooking-kettles, tin dippers and scoop-nets; with here and there a cluster lying in nearer to the main trunk, in the shape of a row of brooms and another of long-handled hoes, shoved in behind "cleats" and touching the ceiling itself. Two long counters running down nearly the entire length of the room, with a cross or L at the end of one, leaving only a narrow entrance to the forbidden territory behind. Down the front of one of the counters a row of barrels with some of the covers removed, and on the same counter a pair of scales and a box of cheese, indicating that on that side of the building groceries and heavy goods were dispensed. Behind that counter, from its height to the ceiling, shelves covered with soap, candies, packages of tea, candles, papers of nails, crockery, articles of hard ware, snuff, tobacco, pipes, and a few drugs and medicines. Over the opposite counter a similar row of shelves, but partially filled and covered with coarse cotton shirtings, sailor stripes, printed calicoes, fustians, coarse broadcloths, flannels and homespuns, with a corner devoted to smaller packages and a loose array of hosiery, woolen gloves, ribbons, pins, combs and the little knick-nackery in some one of which nearly every country household manages to find itself deficient every day of the three hundred and sixty-five. 
               Behind the cross-counter, or L, a row of shelves filled with shoes of every shape and proportion, from the coarse brogan of the farm-laborer to the slipper of the hobbedehoy and the tiny foot-covering of the toddling three-year-old. On either side of this row of shelves a door, that to the left leading down to those subterranean regions in which salt codfish, molasses and rye-whiskey awaited customers; and that to the right, with ascending stairs leading into the back part of the building and to a room the use of which will very soon make itself apparent. 
               Such was the aspect of Squire Holloway's "cheap dry goods and grocery, hard and tin ware and boot and shoe store," in all inanimate particulars, at the moment when Charley Denniston set foot therein. But there were other aspects, more changeable but quite as interesting. From the door leading into the cellar emerged a shock-headed boy of twelve or fourteen, Miss Lattice's lieutenant or second-in-command, who attended to the coarser details of business,-bearing a jug filled with molasses, from which he was wiping the spilled rivulets of sweet stuff with his fingers, then licking the latter to satisfy two tastes at once. Near him and in waiting stood one of the fishermen from the coast, straw-hatted, fustian-trowsered, bare-footed, and with an air of salt dampness about clothes and person,-bearing a damp bag and waiting impatiently for a peck of salt to cure his lucky catch of fish. A stout negro bare-footed like the fisherman and covering a large proportion of the floor with his pedals of unrestrained growth, was trying the spring of a hay-fork to be used in the gathering of the fall crop of salt hay from the marshes; and to complete the picture of the customers, a youngster of six, sent by one of the neighboring spinsters for what he graphically designated as "free eggs' wuff of snuff," had chanced to let two of them fall upon the floor while waiting, seriously to the damage of their integrity of shell, and was down on his knees on the floor, blubbering in anticipation of the flogging he was to receive on his return, and vainly trying to replace the slippery yolks in the coverings from which they had been thus prematurely hatched. 
               Miss Lettice herself, lithe of limb and active of disposition, long before the young man entered the store, had flown behind the counter devoted to dry-goods, and was just then endeavoring to gather up some of the neglected threads of her business by selling half a dozen yards of cotton print, through which the proverbial "straws" might very easily have been blown, for a few cents per yard, to a thin, miserable-looking woman with a faded dress and a cotton shawl, who seemed to think the purchase (as indeed it may have been) one of the notable events of her life, and who felt the texture of the worthless stuff, and held it up to the light, and required double assurance as to the durability of its colors, with much more of interest in the transaction than some republican princess of the metropolis displays in ordering a whole cart-load of Naples silks and Lyons velvets at il palazzo di Stuardo.
                
               To her entered, striding in just as the young New Yorker had crossed the threshhold, Mr. Steve Battersby, a six-foot haw-buck of the up-country order, magnificent in ill-fitting Sunday clothes, riding-whip in hand, and his whole manner indicative of that meanest of human positions, being a "small triton of the minnows"-the spoiled, coarse and arrogant heir of one of the "rich men" of a neighboring section. 
               "Look a'here, Letty, give us some cigars, and be quick about it!" was his salutation, more offensive in manner than in words, and whereat Charley Denniston had an indefinable impression of the mingled duty and pleasure of occasionally knocking down a fellow being. Such an address to her! The young man, without knowing why or really being at all aware of the fact, had begun to champion, in his mind, the pretty girl behind the Squire's counter, and required little provocation to do it bodily. But he need not have troubled himself with the thought. Letty Holloway was quite as capable of championing herself against ordinary verbal vulgar impertinence, as she was of looking bewitchingly handsome and irresistible. Of course she heard the demand, but she paid just the same attention to it that she might have done to the mewing of one of her pet kittens. 
               "How many yards did you say you thought you would want, Mrs. Rice?" she asked very coolly of the woman with the cotton shawl, who had not decided upon any number of yards. 
               But before the woman could reply, the hawbuck burst out with: 
               "Did you hear what I said? I want some cigars, and want 'em quick!" 
               "Eight yards?-yes I think that will be enough." This remark, totally oblivious of the smoker's demand, again directed at her special and silent customer. 
               "Look a'here, Letty Holloway,-if-" 
               How far the hawbuck might have gone with his profane adjuration, is uncertain. The young girl, deigning him an instantaneous side-glance that was much more difficult to bear than total neglect, also favored him, at this stage of the proceedings, with the following, directed to the shock-headed second-in-command: 
               "Jem, that pig wants a straw to put in his mouth-get it for him and stop his grunting!" 
               Jem, dirty-fingered (from the molasses), as well as shock-headed, stepped behind the grocery counter, and handed over a box of cigars almost bad enough in quality to have been sold for ten or fifteen cents each during the fourth year of the great rebellion. The hawbuck put down his hand to select, but unfortunately, at that moment, he espied something on the face of the boy, that did not please him. The boy, in short, was grinning from ear to ear, in enjoyment of the treatment of the customer by his young mistress, and there was a low chuckle going on in his throat, indicating that at an early moment he might break out into a guffaw. The hawbuck did not like disdainful laughter directed at himself, even from a shop-boy: very few of us do! Besides, he was a rich man's son, and accustomed to be bowed to with obsequiousness, the country over. He could not find any one else so convenient for cowing down at that period, so he scowled at the boy, and objurgated him at the same moment: 
               "Grinning at me, you little-" 
               Doomed to be interrupted again! Just so much more was necessary to provoke an outburst from the shock-headed boy, and he broke into a loud chuckle, which seemed likely to choke him, the chuckle being suddenly interrupted by a sounding slap from the hand of the hawbuck, taking him in the neighborhood of the left ear and cheek, and giving him a knowledge of astronomy which he might have been slow to acquire during his limited winterings at the district school. 
               "Take that, you-saucy little whelp!" (the dashed expletives must be forgiven, often as they occur; such men as the hawbuck cannot possibly speak, even at this day, without an oath every fifth word.) 
               How darling little pussy-cats, with soft velvet paws and fur that one cannot caress too often or too fondly, turn into small tigers with fur erect and protruded claws that rend like so many knives,-no one has much idea; but that such a metamorphosis does often occur, all can testify. 
                      
                        "Trust not to night-old ice, or snow 
                        That some spring day may see, 
                        Or slumbering snakes, or words that flow 
                        From the girl upon your knee," 
                     
                   says the brave and wise old Thorsten Vikingsson, in the "Sagann ad Fridthiofe Fraekna,"-the cream of which axiom may be skimmed into the plainer English of-Don't trust too far the good-humor and for bearance of a merry and mischievous little woman! 
               At that blow to a helpless and humble dependant, Lettice Holloway fired as if she had been a small powder-magazine and the rough hand something that supplied the electrical connection-fired as she might not have done if the same blow had descended on the saucy pink little ear that played bopeep with the ear-drops from beneath her curls. In about three seconds, Jurgensen's time, she had forgotten poor Mrs. Rice and her immediate need of calico, and was around the counter in front, face flushed and eyes flashing, arms akimbo after a manner which would have beseemed somewhat older years than hers-confronting the hawbuck and hurling out a few quick, sharp words from her lips quivering with indignation: 
               "Steve Battersby, you brute, not a cigar or anything else do you get, here! Now get out of this store as quick as you can, and don't come inside of it again, mind!" 
               For a moment the hawbuck cowered before the angry girl, then the rough sullen nature asserted itself and he growled out: 
               "Who the devil are you, Let Holloway, to order people out, I should like to know! Nothing but a low-lived shop-girl! I will go out of here when I please, and come in again when I please!" 
               All this while Charley Denniston had been standing near the door, a few feet from Battersby and a silent auditor and spectator of the whole affair. But if the hawbuck had known how his fingers were tingling and how the blood was surely working its way up from the extremities towards his brain, he might have wished him to be somewhat farther distant. In truth the young man would have given any reasonable sum for an excuse to take up the girl's quarrel and make a violent assault on the human cur. What were his feelings, then, when Letty Holloway, immediately on delivery of Battersby's ultimatum, turned short around to him, blushing a little, perhaps, but as earnest in her purpose as ever was missionary when he went over to the Coast of Africa to supply the natives with human ragout,-and said: 
               "I know I am taking a liberty, sir, but you look like a gentleman and a nice fellow-" 
               Oh, the blood that flew up into Charley Denniston's face, just then!-forced up by the united powers of astonishment, pleasure and indignation! 
               "-You look like a gentleman and a nice fellow. Would you mind taking the trouble of just putting that man out of doors?" 
               Perhaps never was son of New York merchant before or since set at such an employment and at so short notice; but then most assuredly never before or since has one owned precisely such an employer as Lettice Holloway. It is doubtful whether he had ever found occasion, three times in his young life, to lay his hand upon any person in anger or earnest, even amid the insolence and violence of a great city; but from the moment when the young girl spoke, he no more doubted his ability to perform her strange behest than he questioned its propriety. Propriety?-forsooth! Love makes lions out of lambs, quite as often as it transforms the beast of ravage into helpless and inoffensive mutton. Without a word in reply, the young New Yorker made a half step forward towards the aggressor. 
               "Put me out-you! I'd like to see either one of you do it-that's all!" 
               Such were the words of Mr. Steve Battersby. Valiant hawbuck!-he included the young girl, it will be noticed, quite as much as the man, in the list of those whom he would "like to see put him out." He did see the operation, and feel it, much quicker than he had any reason to expect. For when the last curse was uttered, Charley Denniston, quite as mad beneath the influence of a new feeling as ever was toper under the glass of brandy which just brought him up to the fighting point,-made a sudden dive forward, fending off his frantic blows without any idea how he did it, caught him fairly inside the guard and partially around the arms, and in a series of violent waltzing whirls interrupted by short digressions of pounding, brought the hawbuck to the door and sent him headlong through it and off the stoop, just in time to fall into the embraces of a dusty fellow with a flour-bag turned inside out, who was approaching the store, and to inaugurate a second clench between the two, which left Mr. Steve Battersby with badly-braised face and his clothes in such a state as indicated that he must have been run through some mill-hopper in company with a few bushels of very smutty grain. 
               The hawbuck did not return to settle the question of his ejectment; bullies are nearly always cowards; and how he and the man with the flour-bag finished their supplementary dispute, before Mr. Battersby, his fine clothes spoiled and his temper in a still worse state of disarrangement, leaped to his horse and rode away, is a matter of no consequence to the further progress of this narration. Enough to say that Denniston, when he had seen his antagonist fairly launched from the stoop, instantly turned and re-entered, to find poor Mrs. Rice, the woman with the faded dress and cotton shawl, her hands up-lifted in astonishment and alarm, uttering such helpless exclamations as "Oh, deary me!" "Who ever'd ha' thought o'seein' the like in this round world!" and "Oh, Miss Holloway, won't one or the other of 'em be killed?"-to find the shock-headed boy still standing behind the counter, as the safer place, chuckling a little, and his mouth so distended by a hideous grin that there was danger of the disjointing of the neck;-to find the salty-aromated man from the coast just arising from a basket of eggs in which he had unwittingly sat down in the extremity of his amused surprise,-and to find the prime mover in the sudden onslaught standing nearly where he had left her, her arms no longer akimbo, but her hands on hips to support her in the convulsions of a fit of laughter which seemed to shake her from curly pate to dainty toe, while the same music peal which had rung a quarter of an hour before at Joe Harrison's proposal, was chiming up among the boots and baskets on the ceiling, at the hawbuck's discomfiture. 
               A nice specimen of girl to be the presiding spirit of a mercantile establishment!-so smiles Miss Prudence Propriety and so snuffles Deacon Droner Longchaps and so groans the ponderous Rev. Jeremiah Poundtext, at this juncture. And the fact is admitted, with this apologetic addition-that for the existence of such a female mercantile anomaly in the rural and marine county of Seaboard, the writer is much less responsible than Squire Billy Holloway himself, the happy little wife who had long before finished her work and gone to her rest, and the secret influence which seem to watch over the hereditary transmission of leading propensities. 
               But Charley Denniston came back from the door, as has been already recorded: where at the young girl instantly flushed to a most painful redness, as if under the feeling that she had been guilty of a most dreadful impropriety in making such a requirement of a stranger,-then, as she met his frank, open, handsome face, with an answering flash upon it and no sign whatever that he held her lightly for the act, recovered her equanimity and held out one of the little hands that even labor could not make otherwise than soft, taper and rosy,-and said, with just enough casting down of the bright eyes to make them more irresistibly piquant and dangerous: 
               "I am really ashamed of myself, sir-asking so much of a total stranger; but indeed I thought that you looked as if you would not mind doing it, and I did not wish to disturb father." 
               The young man took the little hand that was extended-oh yes, be sure that he took it, and that, exceeding his privilege, somehow he managed to take it in both of his. And it was in a voice more broken and passionate than any tone he had used since the advent of manhood, that he said, in reply: 
               "Miss Holloway-you must excuse my knowing your name, for I have already heard it several times since I came-pray do not apologize for anything that you have said or done. That brute deserved all the punishment he has received, and I am only grateful to you for allowing me the privilege of doing, at your order, what I wished to do of my own accord!" 
               "Did you, indeed? Then I was not wrong! I am so glad to hear you say so!" and the bright dark eyes lifted themselves for one moment to his face, shining over his mental world from the new horizon and then veiling themselves again as some of us have seen the morning sun throw a first broad, clear glance over the wakening world, then coquette and play at hide-and-seek with the rosy clouds, and at last for a time hide itself completely behind them, to break forth again, a little later, in ten times brighter and more bewildering glory. The eyes dwelt for quite that instant on the young man's face, before she completed her words of self-gratulation: "I am so glad that you are a nice good fellow and don't scold me like everybody else when I do something that suits me!" 
               "Scold you?" Charley Denniston asked that question with the same surprised air as he might have displayed if some one had hinted in his presence at stabling horses in the nearest church or committing the minister on a charge of sheep-stealing. 
               "Scold me? yes, of course-everybody but father. But I forgot-would you tell me your name, now that you know mine?" 
               "Oh yes, with great pleasure," answered the young man, who might have thought it no great cross to give her his name, in more senses than one. "You must excuse me, Miss Holloway, for not giving it before. My name is Denniston-Charles Denniston, though most people call me 'Charley,'-of New York." 
               "They call you 'Charley,' just as they call me 'Letty,'" the young girl mused in a sort of merry, reflective chirp. "Now I know that you must be a good-natured clever fellow, or they would never do so." 
               This time the red flush that once more crept up to the brow of the Squire's daughter was quite answered by one that rose to the forehead of her ally, at this naively frank commendation. Mrs. Rice meanwhile waited patiently for her calico, as if any time next week would do as well, and the progress of sales was suspended, except so far as the shock-headed Jem could succeed in bearing the world of commerce on his own narrow shoulders. Lettice Holloway and her new acquaintance were still standing very near each other, at the door, and the young man asked, with his voice much lower than it had before been; 
               "Miss Holloway, may I ask you an impudent question?" 
               The young girl looked up. "Yes, I don't mind impudent questions, much I think, if they are only good-natured." 
               Charley Denniston laughed, in spite of himself, at so naive a reply. 
               "Had that man any cause to be angry with you, that he treated you so rudely?" 
               "No-yes-" and here the young shopkeeper grew painfully red-redder than she had been at any previous period of the conversation. 
               "Well?" 
               "Yes, I suppose he has been vexed and angry at me, any time the last year, because-" 
               "Well?" 
               "I don't know what right you have to ask me such a question, or why I should answer it, but I will. Steve Battersby does not like me, because-because I did not like him. There, will that do?" 
               "Phew!" The whistle was quite involuntary, but unavoidable. "Do you know that he is the second man I have seen since I came here, and they both-. Do they all do so?" 
               "Fall in love with me? Yes, I suppose so. Stop, now, Mr. Denniston, don't you think that I have paid you enough, for putting that man out of doors? I like you, but I am not going to tell you everything! Did you want to see my father?" 
               The young man colored again a little, at this broad hint that he was presuming, and presumed no further. His answer was one of a business character. 
               "Yes, Miss Holloway, I wished to see the Squire as soon as possible and if I had no been spending the time in such pleasant company, I should say that I have already hindered too long." 
               "Father is up-stairs, in the office. Go up those stairs, if you please, and you will find the office at the other end of the long chamber. Father is there. Good day, sir. Now I must attend to my customers." 
               Almost by the time the words were spoken she was again behind the dry-goods counter and endeavoring to repair some of her long injustice to the poor woman with the cotton shawl, by measuring off for her those few yards (good measure, under her fingers,) of cheap calico; and as the store thus resumed its normal condition of heterogenous but profitable trade, the visitor cast one more pleased glance back at the high-priestess, passed up the steps and ascended towards what had been designated as Squire Holloway's "office." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               THE DISCOMFITURE OF WIDOW BENSON. 
               IT really must have seemed to young Charley Denniston, that day, if he had any sensation left to realize the fact, after his meeting with Lettice Holloway,-that the demons of laughing mischief were nearly as rife and active, in and about the centre of the village of Topsail, as they could ever have been around Schirk and Ehland, districts of the Hartz Mountains, at any Walpurgis midnight when they were visited by the imagination of Goethe. Laughter as he approached the porch, laughter within the store; and now, as he neared the office, another burst of it, the prevailing tone gruff and hearty, but blended with the shrill squeal of a much younger voice apparently in the last agony of cachinnation, and both with another sound that gave the impression of strong, hearty feminine scolding, in a voice much more forcible than amiable. Then a female form broke out at the door, very stout and red-faced, and with a big yellow-silken caleche bonnet in its hand-broke out and rushed for the stair-way, nearly upsetting the young New Yorker, and leaving behind her a chorus of laughter in two voices, not interrupted by any conflicting sound. What could be the secret of such proceedings, in a spot supposed to be so hedged about with gravity, if not divinity, as the private office and erewhile court-room of a dignified justice of the peace? 
               In order at once more fully to understand the character of the man whom pretty Lettice Holloway had unavoidably accepted as a father, and the reason of this incongruous burst of merriment,-it will be necessary first to allude to the long-established character of Squire Billy Holloway, and then to go back in point of time, in the narration, to something like a couple of hours before this catastrophe. 
               There probably had never been a more intrinsically just or useful man than the Squire, holding on shoulder one corner of the broad ermine of justice, since the first conception of the science of law. More thoroughly ed- ucated men there might have been many; more practically able men there could have been but few; and of more incorrigible devotees of the great twin sciences of merriment and mischief, there had probably never been one ushered into mundane existence. Letty Holloway came by her laughter and her mischief honorably and naturally. As a boy he had been an athlete and a leader in all the harmlessly wild sports of his time. Tradition said that he had assisted in removing more village gates and supplying their places with others that did not fit so accurately-piled more tin pans trap-sticked over doors that were expected to open very noiselessly, when some of his young companions were coming home late from "courting"-eloped with more indispensable garments from the edges of bathing-pounds-been, in short, the terror of more very stupid or very proper people than any one young reprobate within a radius of a hundred miles. Years, sorrows and the responsibilities of life had somewhat calmed him, but they had by no means sobered, the latter word being taken in its usual acceptation. The whole country had learned to confide in him, but the whole country had not learned to be precisely certain when or how some trenchant bolt of his mischief might fall, causing confusion which generally resulted in the detection of imposture or the relief of the unfortunate, but making immediate victims the reverse of comfortable for the moment. 
               The Squire was past fifty, but there was always a twinkle in his bright gray eye, a quiet smile lurking around the corners of his genial mouth, and a very halo of good feeling spanning the broad brow under that dark hair rapidly changing to silver, and informing the whole of that bluff, healthy, hearty form which years seemed to have robbed of its elasticity only to make it more substantial and enduring. Spite of his jests and offences against the law of gravity, his was a clear conscience; for in not a single instance could he lay the charge to heart, of having led one otherwise peaceable man into litigation; and he had always shown his repugnance to contests between man and man, by reasoning away slight differences or laughing the holders into so ridiculous a position that they were often ashamed of having made any publicity of them. He had come to be, consequently, a sort of general arbitrator and peace-maker, much more than the man of sharp legal precedents and maxims which his commission gave him warrant to be; and many an hour that might profitably have been devoted to personal interests, yielding him golden return, had been spent (perhaps not less profitably) in reconciling small bickerings and keeping fees away from the pockets of other lawyers as well as his own. God bless the memory of the good old, merry, mischievous, inactive magistrate!-and lightly lie the turf above him, now that the world is filled with a race of men who seem never to have read that clause of the Sermon on the Mount-"Blessed are the peacemakers!" 
               On that September day in question, an hour or two before the coming of Charley Denniston to the store, Squire Holloway became aware, looking from one of the front windows of his office up-stairs, that the Widow Benson was bearing down upon the building, sailing large, as one of his marine neighbors would have said, and threatening, with her bulk and the energetic character of her stride, to demolish any smaller opposing body with which she chanced to come in contact. The Squire was just then lying back at case in his office chair, and smoking, while Rod, his office-boy and clerk, seventeen, red-haired, freckled-faced, and nearly as mischievous as his master, was perched on a high stool at the desk, lazily copying some papers that did not seem to be wanted in any peculiar haste, and surreptitiously taking occasional lunches of one of the avant-couriers of the yellow-covered novel, hidden under the desk and easily reached. 
               The Widow Benson, as we have said, was approaching rapidly, and though she might be destined for some other port, the Squire had an instinctive idea, from the rapidity of her walk and the flourishing of her blue cotton parasol, that there was law in the wind. He had once previously had a visit from her, on a legal errand, several months before, and on that occasion had come out with damage from the encounter, as did most of those who sought either to lead or oppose the elephantive virago. Attempting to advise her, then, he had been ordered to "shut up, till he knew what he was talking about;" and finally, after remaining half an hour in silence while his client let off a corresponding amount of rigmarole, he had been met with the counter and indefensible charge of "sitting like a fool, gape! gape! and neither answering yes nor no!" 
               Under such circumstances, it might have been supposed that when the Squire saw his client approaching with an air which bespoke "business," he would temporarily vacate the premises and be "out" until she was gone; but he took no such precaution. Perhaps he was a little better prepared than before, for any emergency that might arise. 
               The Widow was very hot and puffy when she arrived, as beseemed a woman weighing over two hundred pounds, after a mile or two of very fast walking on a day no cooler than one in September, and when her blood, too, was heated by the remembrance of wrongs and outrages too terrible to be endured. The Squire, meanwhile, as she surmounted the stairs from the store, and entered, was luxuriously calm and quiet, looking as if no wave of trouble had ever rolled over his-not "unruffled bosom," for they wore ruffles in those days, but plaited shirt-front. 
                
               The Widow Benson was forty and a fraction-the fraction more or less than ten. She was fat enough to be ponderous, and ugly enough, with her yellow rhinoceros hide and the three big warts upon her nose, to have frightened to death her helpmate, John Benson, in five years after marriage-at least people accredited her with that exploit. There were others, ill-natured enough to suggest that the poor man had died of a different affliction-a disease of the ears and brain, superinduced by excessive oratorical efforts on the part of Mrs. Benson. Certain it was, and had been, that the widow Benson had a tongue-an organ in full play and capital train, that could drown the notes of any ordinary brass band, or the din of a village bar-room, on election evening. 
               The widow, on this occasion, took the seat offered her by Rod, and commenced fanning herself with the big caleche bonnet of yellow silk. The Squire had thrown away his cigar, as good mariners do when very heavy weather is coming on-but retained his seat, his hands in his pockets, and a strong propensity to whistle manifest in both corners of his mouth. Rod took advantage of the presumable corning occupation of his chief, to desert his copying altogether and plunge into the delicious intoxication of his novel, in which, at about that period, Lady Matilda and her eleven lovers, all twin brothers, were getting so charmingly involved that no fear existed of their ever being brought out of their entanglement. 
               The widow began her tale of grievance. The Squire lay back in his chair and listened. She was very peculiarly situated-as who, by the way, is not-their own story being taken as a criterion? She had a neighbor named Samuel Walker, against whom she had a double cause of complaint, serious in both aspects: the first, that the villain, Walker, persisted in doing serious damage to a tract of timber land belonging to her, by keeping open a certain drift road through it, for his own use exclusively; and the second, no less serious, but scarcely so explainable, that Walker would not take at their full value either her charms or her hints, and visit one of the Domins in her company. The Squire listened calmly for a few moments, and then, finding that she had really no cause of action against Walker, and that the amount of abuse contained in the recital was of that slanderous character requiring a listener as well as an utterer, took the risk of interrupting her with: 
               "Mrs. Benson, are you aware that you are talking very harshly of Mr. Walker?" 
               "Harshly? the wretch! no!" fumed the widow. "I am not making him out half as bad as he is." 
               "At any rate you are proceeding ex parte," said the Squire. 
               "Ex what? Oh, you mean that I am only telling you a part of it. Wait a bit, and you shall have the whole, or my name is not Becky Benson!" 
               "Humph! how am I to know the truth of all this?" enquired the Squire, who evidently thought it time, at any risk, to stop the torrent of vituperation. 
               "So you doubt my word, do you!" foamed the widow, growing still redder in the face than ever. "Now I just want' you to understand, Squire Holloway, if you've got brains to understand anything, that I'd just as lief have Sam Walker hear every word that I'm saying, as not Drat him!-I wish he was here, and you'd see if I'd take back one word!" 
               "Oh, if that is the case," said the Squire, very blandly, "it is all right. Now then, Rod!"-and he motioned to that dignitary to put himself in position for special service. "Rod, there, Mrs. Benson, can just take down what you say, and I can send it to Mr. Walker, and then you wont require to tell it all over to him at another time. Rod, go to work." 
               Rod put away his novel, upset the inkstand in doing so, sprang down and wiped up the ink, climbed back again and was ready to write, in much less time than has been consumed in relating the event. 
               "Now then, Mrs. Benson," suggested the Squire, noticing that the clapper of the human mill had suddenly stopped. 
               "Look here, Squire Holloway," said the widow, in a feminine growl that was very threatening, "if this is the way that a poor lone woman is to be treated, I'll know the reason why! Can't I speak a word, unless that impudent good-for-nothing-I don't see what you want him about here for, at all!-is to be set to writing it down! No, not another word will I speak, if he is going to write!" 
               "Rod, you needn't mind-go on with, your copying," said the Squire, who had been applying a test of the credibility of narration, to which he was somewhat addicted, (Not all of us, by the way, in making an every-day narration, would like to have "Walker" present or "Rod" setting down our every word for repetition to the other parties interested). Rod went back to his book and took up the same chapter, in which Lady Matilda and her suite, stopping to gather cocoa-nuts on the steppes of Siberia, had not long before been attacked by nineteen brigands armed from crown to heel, and the Baron Wilhelm was just putting the last of them to flight with a twenty-foot sapling pulled up by the roots. 
               "Now then," benignantly remarked the Squire-"go ahead, Mrs. Benson; the difficulty is removed." 
               "Yes," said the amiable widow, "and its well he is removed, or I would have removed him-drat him! Well, as I was saying-" and the narration went on. 
               How long it went on before the Squire went off-i.e., to sleep, there is no means of ascertaining. Certain it is that at the moment when she reached the most exciting period in her excoriation of Walker, she looked towards the man of law, and something in his appearance failed to please her critical eye. It may have been that some sound, nasal in its character, rising on the still air of afternoon, offended her critical ear. With a bound she sprang from her chair, the yellow caleche bonnet waved in one hand-planted herself full in front of the Squire and bawled out in such tones as had no doubt often of old struck terror to the heart of the now happily-delivered John Benson: 
               "Squire Holloway, drat your picture!-do you mean to listen to me, or go to sleeping and shoring there like a hog?-say!" 
               "Certainly, ma'am!-go on," said the Squire meekly, and rousing himself so quickly, if he was asleep, that the widow would not have been quite prepared to swear to his lapse of attention. 
               "Well, then why don't you answer? Here I've come to you for an opinion, and told you the whole story, and you haven't said a word about it since I began. Ain't you going to give it to me, say?" 
               "Mrs. Benson," said the Squire, solemnly, "I did not like to interrupt you, but now I think that I understand the case sufficiently to give an opinion that will save you any further trouble. Here, Rod; that book!" and Rod forthwith hauled down the first that came to hand, which happened to be a volume of Rollin's Ancient History, and which the Squire proceeded, with an air of even increasing solemnity, to open and to read at the commencement of the invasion of Rome by the Northern barbarians. 
               Erudition is quite as welcome outside the walls of colleges as inside-(perhaps because it is quite as rare): and there is nothing so grateful to the ignorant as to believe that they are being addressed as if they knew something. The widow Benson was mollified when the Squire took down the big book; she was delighted when he opened it; and her countenance assumed an expression of unaccountable serenity, and her head nodded complacently, when he had discussed a few paragraphs. She did not exactly appreciate the connection, it was true, between the wood-lot and the drift-road, and the big words about wars and slaughters that rolled from the legal tongue; but she considered that it must be all right, and she was satisfied. Rod, still perched on his stool, left off the perusal of that supplemental chapter of the romance, in which the Lady Matilda had just been catching fish for her dinner through the windows of her dungeon two hundred feet below the bottom of Lake Sanguenoir,-and crunching a few apples with discretion, listened attentively to what he would have been too indolent to read at the expense of his darling romances. 
               The Squire read on. The widow listened, in a state of glorious confusion. Five, ten, twenty pages of history-the Squire was very fond of historical reading, and thought the occasion a good one for the general rubbing up of his rustiness. Thirty pages gone over, and the widow gave token of weariness. She yawned, in so threatening a manner that she might well have been suspected of cannibalism; and two or three times she winked awfully. Not so the Squire, who seemed never to have been fresher; and Rod fell into such a state of suppressed cachinnation as made his fourth apple dangerous. 
               At length the widow, tired out and without a particle of brain remaining, made a sign for the reader to stop; but he shook his head and waved his hand majestically, and only interpolated in the exploits of Thedoric the Visigoth the following remark: 
               "Mrs. Benson, your case is a solemn and serious one. You have been deeply wronged, in a manner for which only the darkest ages of antiquity can furnish a precedent. This being the case, it becomes necessary to make the deepest research into the origin of law, to lay a proper foundation for the extended proceedings which will be found necessary. You have asked me for an opinion, and I am about to give you one, deliberately." 
               Just then an alarming thought struck the widow Benson. 
               "Squire, you ain't going to charge me for all that, are you?" she asked, drowsiness and anxiety blended in her tones. 
               "Mrs. Benson, not a cent!" answered the Squire, waving his hand majestically. "Justice is free not sold, Mrs. Benson, I am proud to say!" and then he read on, apparently as fresh as when he began that experiment on female patience and ignorance. 
               But human endurance has its limit-a remark which may have been made before, at some dim and distant era of literature. Within the next ten minutes the widow began to nod, in a very un-Homeric fashion, under her previous fatigue and the weight of Rollin's erudite stupidity,-then raising herself again like a lion shaking the dewdrops from his mane, as if to repudiate the suspicion that she had ever known the meaning of the word "drowsiness." 
               Then came the time when exhausted nature could endure the strain no longer. The widow Benson made one more convulsive effort to stop the ever-increasing torrent of great words rolling from the legal lips; and then her head fell over on one shoulder, and she slept-slept such a sleep as it was believed John Benson never enjoyed between his marriage-night and his burial-slept with such a compound snorting rumble and roar as must seriously have disturbed the rats domiciled behind the ceiling of the old building, and made them think of changing their quarters with a view to safety. 
               Then the Squire desisted, wiped the perspiration from his brow, lit another cigar, and lay back in his chair with the air of a man who felt that he had performed a great action in a creditable manner. If he chuckled, he chuckled silently, and Rod for some fifteen minutes managed to avoid disturbing the sleeper by a single antic-an exercise of self-denial altogether unparalleled in the history of that amiable young person. 
               But this calm was temporary and treacherous. After a few moments that grand total of enjoyment which had been accumulating under the red hair and waistcoat of master Rod, grew too mighty for suppression. The fun of the whole thing-the big words and grave face of the mischievous Squire, and the figure of the ponderous and yellow-faced old woman snoring away in its half-bent condition on the chair-all this became overpowering-overwhelming. He began to chuckle-snorted-strangled; and in the effort to control himself lost his balance on the high stool and went over headlong into the lap of the widow, nearly tumbling her at length on the floor and quite arousing her from her slumber to the belief that she was being assaulted and murdered. And this last contretemps-so much better than he could possibly have arranged-quite upset the equanimity of the Squire. While the widow was rubbing her eyes and taking in through all her obesity the fact that she had been tricked and trifled with-and while Rod, entirely oblivious of Lady Matilda and her mysteries, lay kicking and screaming with mirth on the floor,-the master of all the mischief broke out into a thundering bass of laughter which seemed to fill the whole building with sound, while he rose up, and sat down again, and grew purple in the face, and controlled himself and burst out again, and behaved like the veriest spoiled old boy that ever shamed the grey hairs of fifty by the ungovernable merriment of eighteen. 
               This-the chorus of the two laughers and the enraged exclamations of the widow (whose words at this juncture need not be put upon record) formed the unique trio heard by young Charley Denniston as he ascended the stairs and approached the partially open door of the office; and it was the widow Benson, taking her last farewell of Squire Holloway with a blending of exclamations which included howls of rage, oaths of respectable calibre and the blowing of an entangled porpoise,-who dashed out and disappeared past him, just as the Squire flung the big book at Rod and dropped back into his chair completely exhausted and in some danger of apoplexy. 
               It is not to be supposed that the young New Yorker, an entire stranger to both the actors except as the one had met him for a few minutes some hours before-became possessed of all the facts just recorded, immediately on his coming upon the scene of action; nor would they have been recorded at all, in this connection, but for the reason before given-the desire of developing as broadly as possible the character of Squire Billy Holloway and of affording some clue to after events with which he was to be connected. Charley Denniston managed, in a few moments, to extract from the mirthful dignitary enough hints of what had lately occurred, to give him a laughing insight into the causes of the ponderous woman's discomfiture; and if the Squire did not have occasion to tell him all, we may be reasonably confident that the young man justified the reticence by forgetting to tell him what had occurred below stairs under cover of the reading of Rollin and the uproarious merriment-how he had been bewitched by a pair of bright eyes of which he, the Squire, was in some sort a proprietor-how he had been snared and tangled amid a mass of unmanageable curls, set trembling like a schoolboy in the presence of a pair of pouting and kissable lips, and turned into a prize fighter by a nod from a head quite as compelling as Jove's. 
               As to the matter in hand-the whole affair furnished another proof how seldom we succeed in the precise thing attempted, how often we ignorantly perform something else quite as important. Charley Denniston, it seemed highly probable, in that visit to the universal and heterogeneous store at Topsail, had found a new impulse and direction for life: he had done nothing whatever to ameliorate the condition of Barnard North. 
               When Squire Holloway became fully advised of Denniston's errand, and informed of the events that had already taken place at the cottage of the Wrecker, he seized the young man by the hand with a grasp which proved how much he appreciated the generosity in a stranger, and said: 
               "I wish the devil had the whole pack of them! Gone to arrest Barnard North, have they?-the nearest to an honest man on the whole coast, and the bravest, I am sure. And I must be fool enough to issue that warrant, in the dark. Never mind, what is done cannot be undone!" 
               "Can nothing be done, Squire?" 
               "Nothing until he is really arrested: then we may do something for him, by a habeas corpus. They can't harm him much, you may be sure of that. The devil take the whole pack of them, I say again! I will do anything I can to keep the best man on the coast from being wronged and disgraced." 
               Charley Denniston thanked him, in his own name and that of humanity. 
               "But you-you are a noble fellow, even if you are a New Yorker!" continued the Squire, who probably had no exalted impression of the people of the great city. "You must come and see me at my house, again, and take dinner with me, and see Letty-that is my daughter. Perhaps you did see her, by the way, as you came through the store?" 
               "Yes, I had that pleasure for a moment," was the somewhat hesitating and a little embarrassed reply. How soon, even in the first blush of a flirtation, or what may grow to be one, we learn to tell something less than the whole truth of what has occurred to us in the one presence! Young Charley Denniston was a splendid fellow, with a brave, true, honest heart, and altogether unspoiled by the world; but even he could modify a statement, if not falsity it, at very brief notice, and with reference to a woman of whom he had never even heard half an hour before! 
               "Letty is a good girl," the Squire ran on, rambling a little and making a sort of verbal ollapodrida quite appetizing to that particular listener. "A good girl, if she is my daughter and attending a village store. She will like you, I am sure she will. How the old woman did boil out and rush down the stairs, didn't she? And they are arresting Barnard North, the best man on the coast?-I wish the devil had the whole pack of them, I say once more!" 
               Then his face, which had been reasonably serious for a few moments, suddenly lighted up with what may have been either a happy thought or a mischievous one, and he spoke to the boy, who had recovered from his convulsion of laughter and climbed back on his stool: 
               "Rod, when you went down street a little while ago, did you see any of the men from the share, at the tavern?" 
               "Yes, sir," answered the boy-"Uncle Zeke Robbins was standing on the stoop, and I thought I saw Radstock going in the door as I went by." 
               "Humph!" said the Squire, musingly. "Well. Rod, I am afraid that some of them may not know what is going on down beach. Stick your hands in your pockets, whistle, and lounge down to the tavern, as if you had nothing in the world to do. If you find any of them, and they don't know of this search-warrant and arrest, drop a few words in the way of information, to say that I issued the warrant this morning, and that you are afraid there may be trouble. Go, now-off with you, and do it quietly, mind!" 
               Master Rod disappeared, to execute his apparently-harmless mission which on its face indicated that Squire Billy Holloway had so general a supervision over the intellects of the section as to be unwilling to leave any one in ignorance of a current event,-but which may have conveyed, to one who knew all the men and all the circumstances, an intention on the part of the legal dignitary to have the process interfered with a little before it reached that stage of ripeness known as habeas corpus. And very soon after him young Charley Denniston took his leave, disappointed in his benevolent effort at thwarting Hawkins, but after accepting (oh, how gladly and readily!) the old Squire's invitation to dine at his house and be introduced to his daughter; and his brain somewhat in a whirl with the variety of odd characters and singular incidents, one vision of odd grace and saucy beauty included, which had fallen under his observation within scarcely more than an hour spent in the little sea-coast village of Topsail. Ah, Charley Denniston!-Charley Denniston!-there was yet more joy and more suffering than you knew, as inevitable results of this visit; but of that hereafter. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               WRECKERS IN COUNCIL. 
               WHATEVER may have been the supposition of Squire Holloway when he dispatched Rob on his errand, it was not really to be supposed that this accusation against Barnard North could have been made without attracting attention among the wreckers and shoremen with whom he had been so long associated,-or that his arrest could have been accomplished without exciting indignation among the number to whom his hand had done so many acts of kindness and who had been either the companions or the spectators of so many of his deeds of almost reckless bravery. There may have been a few-those ignoble souls, conscious of their own demerits and correspondingly ready to believe that against others which could bring them nearer to their own level-there may have been some of those who believed the accusation, or who pretended to believe it; but they were few indeed. Warm hearts beat under the rough blue jackets and coarse Guernsey shirts of the shoremen, as they have always beaten under such covering since the first surfman dared deadly peril in his cockle-shell boat, in other climes and other ages; and the circumstances of the loss of young Robert, already known along more than forty miles of coast through that system of personal communication and general interchange of intelligence which out does the telegraph-these circumstances alone would almost have made a saint of the martyr, in their estimation, even had there been no previous reason for holding him in respect and regard. It may readily be believed that there was joined to this a feeling that the reputation of the whole coast was assailed, when its best man was arrested and carried away to prison on a charge of piracy; and who does not know that many a man, too proud or too indolent to take much care of the details of his own reputation, will fire like a train of gunpowder when an insult is thrown upon the hamlet of his birth or even the the place of his temporary residence? 
               Certain it is that a feeling of very excusable indignation possessed the community who occupied the humble cottages lying along the eastern side of the little village of Topsail and thence extending in a straggling line towards the sea-shore,-and that when it was rumored that day, in the dingy bar-room of the "Eagle Tavern," before alluded to, which stood on the west side of the main street and at the bottom of the slight knoll at the north end of the village, with a swinging sign-board decorated with a yellow eagle on a blue ground and in a state of upstretched strangulation,-that Barnard North had knocked down the Agent of the Board of Underwriters and the officer who dared to accompany him on such an errand as his attempted arrest,-a general shout went up from the rough but generous-hearted fellows who chanced that day to be enjoying the hospitality of the rusty box-stove, the sanded floor, the hacked pine counter and the dusty bottles and dirty glasses that made a tempting row behind it. This feeling even went so far that a close-fisted curmudgeon named Walker (the same, by the way, who enjoyed the drift-road and the peculiar friendship of the widow Benson)-a man who had never before been known to apply his money to any other use than swelling the bulk of a stocking-foot purse carried in his pocket,-was seen on that occasion to open it with an oath of satisfaction and invite all who were in the bar-room to drink with him! At any other time this circumstance might have been deemed extraordinary enough to demand a rural committee of investigation as to his sanity, but just then the sorrows and wrongs of poor Barnard North had power to crowd the thought away. 
               Later in the day the loungers at the tavern (there happened to be a rough east wind blowing, and no attempt could be made to pursue their avocation on the fishing-ground) heard of the issuing of the second peremptory process for the arrest of the Wrecker, and that a wagon had again gone down the causeway with a deputy-sheriff, four constables, and the Agent, all determined to make the arrest, living or dead, and convey the body of the delinquent at once to the county jail at Clayboro. It needed but little, just then, and especially after Rod arrived from the Squire's office and gave them the hint with which be had been entrusted,-to arouse to a somewhat dangerous pitch that indignation which had before appeared to be only smouldering; and any prudent man, measuring the brawny arms and well-knit figures of the men drinking at the bar, smoking short pipes or playing dull games of dominoes in the different sections of the bar-room,-would have judged it better at least to seem a friend, in that company, than an enemy. 
               "Going to take the old man away, are they?" ("old man" is very often a term of confidence and endearment in certain communities)-so said Dick Decker, a bluff-built, round-faced fellow of five-and-thirty, very nattily dressed in blue for a mere shoreman, and with a grasp like a vise and a smile like a sun-burst. "Charged with stealing! He steal a piece of silk?-eh, Uncle Zeke?" 
               "He steal-steal be cussed!" answered Uncle Zeke Robbins, the person addressed, who was quite enough of a "character" to be worthy of a second glance after a first introduction. In dress he affected gray sattinets, but in face and figure had no affectation whatever, nature having supplied him with all the oddity in appearance that could be necessary under any circumstances. He was not more than five feet eight in height, but his broad shoulders, long arms and heavy hands showed him, even at fifty-five, the equal of most six-footers in bodily strength and endurance. Beneath his heavy iron-gray hair there were set in a brown and wrinkled countenance two funny gray eyes which took off all notice from the remainder of the man for a considerable period. They were by no means set straight in the head, and yet no description would be given in saying that he squinted or was cross-eyed. The orbs could be rolled at will, and yet each of them had a predilection. The right, or starboard toplight, (as he would himself have designated it) would sometimes, though seldom, look straight forward: generally it seemed to be cast down at an angle of thirty or forty degrees; while the left, larboard, or port, was cocked up at a corresponding angle, seriously puzzling any one with whom he was speaking, to determine what was his real point of attention. He was generally accredited with being able to see more, at the same moment, than ordinary men: in truth, when working, years before, in connection with one of the ship-yards at the East, and employed in going through woods to select the proper material for ship-timber, they had been in the habit of saying of Uncle Zeke that he had had those eyes arranged to order, so that while with one he could scan the lower trunk of a tree, with the other he could at the same moment be paying attention to the upper limbs and branches. When to this is added the fact that he had a mouth of most quizzical drollery, always rolling about and evidently enjoying that indispensable "quid,"-and that when he spoke he had the habit of lolling over his head on one shoulder, something like that of a bird when unsettled in mind,-some idea may be formed of that outer man whom all the shoremen called Uncle Zeke Robbins. 
               "He steal a piece of silk!" indignantly repeated that personage. "He'd rob a henroost just as quick! I've knowed him, of old!" 
               "Jest as ef he wasn't able to buy a piece of silk, ef he wanted it!" said another, who looked poor enough not to be able to buy a silk hat-band-cost, four cents. 
               "Got to be tuk up, jest for knocking a fellow down in his own house!" was the indignant comment of Sim Radstock, another "character," who was just then whittling out a four-inch surf-boat from a piece of soft pine with a six-inch jack knife, and who like Uncle Zeke, needs, for the purposes of this narration, something more than this "mere mention." 
               Simeon stood, in his shoreman's boots, dark tight trowsers tucked inside the legs of the boots, red shirt and round cap, about six feet three, with a general mould that would have been Appolonian if it had not been Herculean. His round bullet head, covered with short brown curls, seemed too small in proportion to his body, and denoted, what indeed was the fact, that the mental did not quite keep pace with the physical in his composition. He was young-not more than twenty-four or twenty-five; and the ruddy brown face, blue-eyed and good natured, was really handsome, telling something of what Richard Cur de Lion might have been in the days before he married Berengaria and flung away the welfare of his kingdom on the madness of the Crusades. Report said that Sim, like Cur de Lion, had a ready hand, as he certainly had a large and heavy one,-and that more than once, provoked out of his apparent good nature, he had practised upon imprudent people that system which he seemed to hold so lightly in the case of Barnard North. A strong man in every physical sense of the word, with some indications that he might become a hard one, and a certainly that he would always be as unmanageable as a yearling bull; and yet that strong man had a cardinal weakness which will hereafter make itself painfully apparent: with an unconscious recognition of the doctrine of opposites, this man who could have bent an iron bar like a whip-stock or slung a barrel of liquor on his shoulder like a smuggler's keg, was crazily earnest, though as secret as earnest, in his worship of the delicate, nervous, helpless daughter of the Wrecker-poor little Charlotte North! What is it they say of the ivy clinging around the oak?-surely sometimes the oak seems most to need the parasite and commences the attachment which is to end in beauty or ruin. 
               But enough of this, for the present: we have to do, now, with the shoremen at the "Eagle Tavern," who knew as little about philosophy as of Sanscrit, however they may have illustrated it in the most unmistakable English. 
               "Cuss them Insurance Agents!" again broke out Uncle Zeke, after a moment of silence. 
               "You don't like 'em, do you, Uncle Zeke!" replied Dick Decker, with the air of a man who was quite aware of the fact but did not object to hearing it reiterated. 
               "Not much!" was the sententious reply of Uncle Zeke, who took that opportunity for a long pull at a glass of hot whiskey and sugar which had been for some minutes watched by him, top and bottom, with his two errant eyes, while under preparation by the slow hands of the bar-keeper. 
               "Ever had any special trouble with 'em, to make you feel so?" persisted Decker, who may or may not have been fully aware, long before, what reason the old man had for his peculiar dislike. 
               "Y-a-a-s,"slowly answered Uncle Zeke, the run of whose "jawing-tackle" was being momentarily smoothed by the hot whiskey and sugar. "Y-a-a-s-some of you ought to remember it" (perhaps some of them did, but no one said as much!)-no, you was too far up the beach. Well, I'll tell you all about it! Don't like 'em, eh? No, I bet I don't! I'd kick one of 'em, quicker'n I would a dog!" 
               Uncle Zeke illustrated the occasion by removing his quid, in deference at once to the hot liquor and the story; and then all parties knew that something of peculiar interest might be expected. 
               "It was about twelve years ago, down at the lower Inlet," Uncle Zeke went on. "Come out one morning from our fishing-hut-me and Tom Barnes and Soger-you all remember Soger, and what a lazy cuss he was till you got him started? Well, it had stormed mighty hard the night before, and been darker'n Egypt, but we hadn't heard anything that sounded like a wreck. Come out about daylight, as I told you, and-by the big bull-porpoise!-there was a fore-and-aft schooner hard on the bar, the sea makin a clean breach over her, and her decks swept about as clean as Walker's barn floor, there, when he's hunted up the last grain of rye with spy-glass, after thrashin'." 
               A moment of general laughter at Walker, who did not seem to consider the compliment paid to his thrift any unfavorable one; and then the narrator proceeded: 
               "Well, she looked as ef she might have been a coaster of a couple o' hundred tons-been down to Wilmington or Newborn for naval stores. Masts rockin', but not gone yet, and nothin' showin' on deck. Sea mighty heavy, I tell you! We went back to breakfast, and when we come out again, took another look at her. It was lighter, then, but still we couldn't see anything on deck. Stop!-yes! Why, what on earth did I see, and how on earth did I see it? Eyes are sharp, boys, sometimes, when there's work to be done. I ran back to the old house-got my glass (it was a good one, used to belong to Captain Jenks, of one of the Liverpool liners, and he give it to me when his owners got liberal and give him a silver-mounted one, one trip)-got my glass, I say, and got a sweep on the schooner. Ef I didn't see a human hand, with the five fingers of it waving back and forrard, so-then I never hooked soft crab-that's all!" 
               "A human hand!-where was it?" asked half a dozen of Uncle Zeke's auditors, in a breathless way, which showed that they had never before heard all that story, at all events. "Didn't you see anything but the hand?" 
               "Nothin' else, boys-wait, and I'll tell you! I seen it just above the deck, pretty well aft, and on the larboard side. The schooner had come on with head up-beach, and had heeled in shore as she struck. Well, I thought whether that could be a hand, right down there on the deck, and what kept it waving. I give the glass to Tom, and he took a look. I asked him what he seen. 
               "'Looks like a rag, flutterin' about there,' he said. 
               "'Man!-it's a hand. Don't you see the five fingers movin'? I said. 
               "'Looks like a hand, but nary time-it can't be!' said Soger. 
               "'Ef it was a hand, and dead, it wouldn't be wavin'; and there's nothin' alive on that boat!' said Tom. 
               "'Maybe so,' says I, 'but I don't jest believe it! There's somebody livin' there, or there's a raal nateral curiosity, and I'm a goin' to see.' 
               "'Don't believe it,' says Soger, 'but ef you're a goin', I'm a goin' too!' 
               "'So am I,' says Tom, 'but cuss me ef I don't believe we'll all go to soak!' 
               "Well, we had a tough time of it-the toughest I ever seen, but once. Filled the boat three times before we got her off, but come out all right, and all got aboard again each time-a little wet, probably! It was no smooth thing, goin' up to that schooner, even on the lee side; for the devil was havin' a water-holiday and the sea was rippin', some!" 
               As the old man became more and more warmed up with his recital, he began to emphasize more and more in this half-bragging manner, peculiar at times to nearly all people of rough and, adventurous lives; while his auditors hung upon his words with more of a chill in the blood than any of them were in the habit of experiencing. 
               "Where was I? oh-as we come pretty near the schooner, Tom caught a look over his shoulder, and halloed: 
               "By the Holy, Joe, it is a hand!-a hand through a hole in the deck, and it keeps a-wavin'!' 
               "'Thought so!' says I, and that's all I did say, for Tom hadn't minded his oar while he was lookin', and we come pretty near goin' for it. But we got her head to it again, and in a dozen pulls more we was aboard of the schooner without mashin' the boat, though 'twas a close chance for it. We sprung on deck, Tom and me, while Soger fended off the boat. Sure enough, jest alongside of the cabin-hatch on the larboard side (she was a flush-decker, mind) there was a hand, and a mighty white hand it had been afore it was so watersoaked, stickin' out of a hole in the deck jest large enough to let it come through, and wavin', wavin', backwards and forwards, jest so! I grasped hold of it, and though it was very cold I could feel that there was life in it. I thought that I heard a bit of a scream down under the hole. Then I was sure it was a woman that owned the hand, and alive one! 
               "The axe came out from under them thwarts pretty lively, and I went to choppin'. The whole taffel-rail" (taffrail) "had gone over end-ways, and jammed the cabin-doors so that they couldn't be opened, and the sea was breakin' over the stern a little too lively to try movin' it; so that whatever was in the cabin had no way of gettin' out, and there was no way to get at 'em but by cuttin.' I tell you what, boys, there was no time to lose, for the little white hand had stopped wavin' and was hanging like a wet dish-rag against the broken splinters; but it was mighty ticklish cuttin' around it. Tom held it up, so that my axe shouldn't hurt it, and I chopped away. Tuk me a good while, it seemed, to get that hole big enough for gettin' into the cabin, but I did it at last. There was a woman, sure enough-with just enough of life left in her to breathe and moan, but not enough to speak. 
               "It took near a day after we got her ashore, before they could bring her fairly to herself, at one of the houses back from the beach; but they did, and she lived. She was the Captain's wife, and must ha' been a brave one if there ever was one! One of the other passengers was in the cabin with her, dead. The Captain and all the others seemed to have been carried overboard. Somehow or another one of the fallin' timbers had broke a hole through the deck; and the poor woman had stuck her hand through it, as her only signal of distress, and kept wavin' it, even when she was a' most gone! Now, boys," Uncle Zeke concluded-"now you know all about it." 
               "No we don't, Uncle Zeke!" said Decker. "We don't know anything about it, yet! What has this got to do with the way you hate Insurance Agents?" 
               "Oh, I forgot!" resumed Uncle Zeke. "No, it isn't all; but I'll tell you, cuss 'em! The weather turned good, the next day after we boarded the schooner, and they saved all the cargo out of her. One of them scoundrels come down to the beach to see about the cargo; and would you b'lieve that he accused me and Tom and Soger of goin' aboard to steal! said there was a pipkin, or a shovel-and-tongs, or somethin' of that kind, missin' out of the cabin, and he knowed the sea couldnt have washed that out! I threatened to drown him, and made sort of preparations to do it, and he left! But the sneakin' villain actually had the imperdence to publish them suspicious-that was what he called 'em!-in the city papers, and they went the rounds, ruinin the character of the shore, and makin' me swear, half, that I'd never risk my life again, to be called a thief, if all the people that went up and down the coast drownded at my own door!" 
               "The devil take 'em!-and he will, some time or other!" was the mingled and indignant comment from half a score of voices. 
               "Yes, and I've been insulted at a public table for belonging on the line of coast, among a nest of thieves and pirates," said Decker,-"insulted at the very time I was lame from an injury received-you know when I night broke my leg, boys, going on board that Liverpooler,-trying to save life in one of them packet-ships. But your insult, Uncle Zeke?-it never was contradicted by the papers, of course!" 
               "Of course not!" answered Uncle Zeke, taking a survey of Decker's hat and boots at the same moment. "The cusses knowed it was a lie when they published it, and what was the use of contradictin' it afterwards?" 
               "We had forgot all we were talking about, listening to your story," said Sim Radstock. "What are we going to do about Barney North?" 
               "Goin to do?" said Uncle Zeke, doubtfully. "Why, what can we do?" 
               "A good deal, ef we was only to try!" answered Sim, making a motion with his sledge-hammer list at the same moment, which indicated that something could be done to anything that happened to come under it. 
               "What do you mean?" asked Decker. "Lick the Agent?" 
               "That for part," answered Sim, who really seemed to be suffering under forced suppression of the physical energies. "Something else, too, I'm just thinking. What do you say to stopping Barney North's going to jail?" 
               The proposal was a rash one, but it fell on the ears of men who had done still bolder things, and whose minds were just then a little embittered. All looked at Sim, as if he might have had some tempting morsel in hand which each would like to take but felt some hesitation about the prudence of accepting. 
               "Twont do!" at length said one of the calmer or less venturous. 
               "Won't it?" answered Radstock with a sneer. "Ef there's half a dozen of you that has pluck enough to defend the honor of the coast and do one good turn for a man that has done a good many for all of us,-why I say that we'll jest duck that Agent-or tar-and-feather him, I'm not particular which, and let Barney North go back about his business." 
               "But 'twouldn't be helping him any, after all that!" said Dick Decker, who felt that he had something in the way of character at stake, and who withal possessed a little of that uncommon quality called prudence. "They would arrest him again, if they wanted him,-and by-and-bye catch the rest of us, one by one-though that matter's not much consequence!" 
               "No!-the devil take that!" cried Radstock, who by this time was probably almost as intent upon having a difficulty as upon helping the father of little Charlotte North. "What do you say, Uncle Zeke? Have you got stomach enough to pay 'em off for an old score?" 
               This was touching Uncle Zeke in a tender spot, and he could not resist the temptation, coming in that particular shape. Mephistopheles, as every one knows, would not be half so dangerous if condemned always to wear the red breeches and the cock's feather, which might not produce the same fascinating effect upon all others as upon poor coarse-minded Martha Struelin. Give him plenty of different suits and plenty of different baits, and he is the next thing (thank God, only the next!) to omnipotent. Uncle Zeke, with all his age and experience, had his price; and Sim Radstock paid it on the nail by that suggestion about "old scores." 
               "Ef you say so, boys," was the old man's reply, "Uncle Zeke won't be lagging." 
               "Hurrah for Uncle Zeke!" cried Radstock, now getting fairly embarked in his element. "Uncle Zeke's younger than the rest of you, now! Let's go down to Barney's-quietly, you know-and throw the whole devilish bilin' of 'em into the Wax Hole!" (The said Wax Hole being, be it known, a peculiarly miry and quicksandy pond-hole at a short distance below North's, and so called because it was impossible to extricate from its sticky embrace anybody or anything that chanced to fall into it.) 
               "Humph!" said Uncle Zeke, again hesitating: but his hesitation was cut short by the hurried entrance of an insignificant little man in a tarpaulin, red shirt and dirty blue trowsers, who seemed to have the faculty of always being everywhere, seeing everything and knowing everything, in advance of all others. 
               "Well, boys, what do you think!" said Burt, the new-comer, tossing down half a glass of raw whiskey for which he had especially visited the hostelrie. "They've got Barney North in a wagon, at last, and are taking him off to Clayboro." 
               "The devil they are!-where are they?" cried Radstock, springing down from a table beneath which he had been swinging his long legs. 
               "Just striking into the lane below, about this time," said Burt. "They'll be up opposite the village in a few minutes. Don't you want to see 'em and see the last of poor Barney?" 
               "Yes-we are agoin' to see 'em!" replied Radstock, who, with his companions, sometimes played that dangerous game called "bluff," during bad weather, in the fishing-houses. "Goin' to see 'em, and maybe go a little better-eh, Uncle Zeke?" 
               "You can just bet we are!" said the old worthy, and that word was the key-note of the general resolve. 
               There was no longer either hesitation or delay. All the shoremen who were present, to the number of a dozen or fifteen, followed Radstock rapidly out of the tavern, across a field and a little belt of scrubby woods that opened a few hundred yards below, on the road leading back from the coast towards the higher country and Clayboro. Scarcely a word was spoken during their rapid walk, and they had no exact concert of action; but they meant mischief-a mischief more excusable than those will believe who do not know the terrible hardships and the bitter wrongs to which the dwellers by the sea, as well as those who make their homes upon it, are too often subjected. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XV. 
               A RESCUE THAT WAS NO RESCUE. 
               THERE is almost as often a favoring deity presiding over the commission of any contemplated violence, as over the more peaceful and more creditable events of life. The shoremen reached the spot, known by the country people as the Ditch, which the wagon containing the prisoner must pass, at precisely the proper time for the prosecution of their enterprize. They had just crossed the low fence dividing the belt of woods from the common, and leaped the broad ditch which ran up at that point from the salt-meadow,-when they saw an open wagon come lumbering slowly up the road a quarter of a mile below. As it came nearer, they could see that the driver sat on the seat-board in front, the Underwriters' Agent, Hawkins, beside him, and the officers seated on a mass of straw at the bottom of the wagon, the tall form of Barnard North, also seated on the straw, looming up in their midst, but his rough hat drawn partially down over his brow, and his head bent forward on his breast. The condition of the road-wet and overflowed by the late storms-did not allow of rapid progress, and the wagon came up at a trot but little faster than a walk. 
               At sight of more than a dozen men standing suspiciously in a cluster at the side of the road, the Agent, especially after the experience of the morning, evidently suspected mischief; for the shoremen saw him turn to the driver, and the moment after the whip was applied and the horses began to labor over the wet road with their heavy load a little more rapidly. Hawkins at the same time put his hand into his breast-it might have been for a pistol, but if he had one he did not draw it. Perhaps he did not really apprehend an attempt at rescue of so formidable a character as to demand such a deadly weapon. Perhaps he really carried none-no man but himself ever knew. 
               "Hallo, there!" cried Sim Radstock, as the wagon came up,-pointing, as he spoke, apparently to some part of the harness or its coupling to the wagon-"That is a pretty way to fix your harness, I should think! How the deuce did you get along so far without breaking down?" 
               The driver instinctively pulled up, disarmed of all suspicion by the tone of address, and instantly sprang to the ground to look after the imaginary difficulty. In an instant more Radstock had sprung upon the front of the wagon, grasped Hawkins in his arms as if he had been a child, and half leapt with him, half flung him to the ground, managing to land, however, on the top of him. 
               "Some of you help Barney North!" shouted Radstock by the time he reached the ground with his captive, and in a tone loud enough to have commanded an army; and half a dozen of the shoremen, at once leaped into the wagon and grappled the surprised and bewildered constables, scarcely one of whom attempted any resistance. One of them did manage to show the butt of an old horse-pistol, the loading of which was problematical; but this was taken from him by Uncle Zeke and thrown into the ditch, so quickly that the rest scarcely saw it, and with the words: 
               "Them things don't go along shore! Better not try it, ef you don't want a broken head!" 
               The Wrecker partially raised his head, at the stoppage and disturbance, looked around him, but uttered not a word and made no attempt to leave the wagon. He was scarcely observed by the shoremen, however, who knew nothing of his conduct under the second arrest, and who naturally supposed that he would move where he pleased, now that durance was removed. The constables were by that time out of the wagon, but such of them as resisted, overpowered by numbers and lying helpless in the road. 
               "Here, Uncle Zeke!" cried Radstock, the moment after landing with his prisoner helpless under his heavy weight. "Here, Uncle Zeke, pay this fellow off for your other cussed Insurance Agent, while I take care of him for what he has done to Barney North!" 
               "What are you going to do with me, you scoundrels?" thundered Hawkins, loudly as he could in his prostrate condition. "You are interfering with the law, and I will have every man jack of you punished for it till you smart, if I die for it!" 
               "Hold on a bit!" said Radstock, binding his arms with a bandanna handkerchief. "Better not crow before you are out of the woods!" 
               "What are you going to do with me, I ask?" again demanded Hawkins, in no faltering voice, for that he was not a coward we have already seen. "What have I done to you, you reprobates?" 
               "Disgraced the whole coast by laying false charges against honest men," said Uncle Zeke, whom this demand brought into the field as spokesman. "Done that, as many another scoundrel before you has done! Cuss you!-I had my good name ruined by jest such a whelp as you, years ago; and here goes Barnard North, the bravest and best man between Ponticoke and the Cedars, to prison and the devil knows where else, for nothing. That's what you have done!" 
               "Nary a prison!" was the emphatic comment of Sim Radstock, who had just finished his double-knot. 
               "Do you mean to murder me?" asked the Agent, now a little frightened in spite of all attempts to keep up courage. 
               "Tut! no!" said Dick Decker, "I hope you don't think that we look like killing people, even if we do look like thieves!" 
               "Murder? oh no!" said Radstock, who had a sort of grim humor, not seldom associated with moderate intellectuality and a large measure of violence in the composition. "We wouldn't call the killing of such a feller as you, 'murder,' no how! Spoil the characters of honest men, who risk their own lives to save life and property that little deserve it, would you!" And in his indignation he showed a strong propensity to administer a series of kicks to the fallen man, which Robbins prevented, uttering, mean while, the consoling assurance: 
               "No, Mr. Insurance Agent, cuss your blood, we're not goin' to kill you, quite!" 
               "Well, what the devil are you going to do with him?" Sim Radstock asked, as if very certain that something needed, for the man's own welfare, to be done at once. "I don't see anything better to do, than to jest take one of those horse-lines and hang him to a scrub-oak, or let him drop here into the ditch, with a bit of a stone tied to his neck, like a blind kitten." 
               "Neither one," said Uncle Zeke, who had probably been all that time making up his mind on the all important subject of revenge for wrongs of a dozen years before, on an entirely different person, who could have had no connection with the unjust act! "You aren't going to be either hung or drowned, with my consent; but you'll just get the devilishest duckin' you ever had sence you was a small boy and your mother scrubbed your dirty hide on Saturday night." 
               "Duck me!" began the captive man, intending no doubt to follow the word with either threat or entreaty; but Uncle Zeke cut him short with: 
               "Oh, you'll like it better than either hangin" or drownin', when you come to try 'em all! Catch hold of one his legs, Sim!" 
               In another moment, spite of his objections, the poor Agent was soused into the muddy and turbid brook, which at that point contained some three feet of water. Radstock held him by one leg, and Robbins by the other; and though he kicked and struggled, with his bound hands he was powerless as a child. He remained under water, at every plunge, long enough to set him choking and strangling-a suffering which he mingled thickly with oaths and threats. A dozen or more plunges quite exhausted and half drowned him, and he lay almost insensible by the side of the ditch. Then the avenging shoremen desisted. 
               "Now you know a little how surfmen feel, when they are half blinded and more than half drowned, doin' the work you pay 'em so well for, you Yorker," said Sim Radstock, giving him a little poke with his foot. 
               "Publish any more of them pretty stories about us in the newspapers, and see of we don't drown you all the way instead of half, you miserable cuss!" added Uncle Zeke. 
               "Now get up!" said Radstock, untying his hands. The Agent, partially recovered from his stupor, staggered to his feet. If he had a pistol in his breast pocket, it was decidedly dampened and useless after that immersion. "Now get into that wagon and be off with you!" he continued-"Stop! what in the name of all that is holy is this? Barney North hasn't got out of the wagon at all! Here, one of you hold this fellow, for fear he will jump into the ditch again--" 
               "Yes, he likes it so well!" dryly commented Uncle Zeke, taking particular occasion to inspect the top of his mud-plastered head and the soles of his sodden boots, with those two diverging eyes, at one and the same moment. One of the other shoremen taking the weakened and half-dazed man by the collar, Radstock and Uncle Zeke both went up to the side of the wagon, where yet sat Barnard North, no restraint over him now, and yet as much a prisoner as he had been before the attempted rescue! 
               Apparently he had scarcely turned his head to see any of the violent proceedings just accomplished; it was almost certain that he had not moved his limbs from the position in which they were when the wagon drove up. He sat as if momentarily expecting his captors to resume their places in the wagon and drive on with him. 
               "Why, what the devil does all this mean, Barney North?" asked Uncle Zeke, astounded at such a spectacle of inaction. 
               "Yes, what are you sitting there for?" asked Radstock, in the same surprise. 
               "No-I've been watchin' him, and he hasn't made any move to get out. Something must be wrong," said Dick Decker, in a low voice to his astonished companions. 
               "One would think, Barney North," continued Uncle Zeke after waiting a moment longer for a response, "that you didn't thank us for takin' you out of the hands of these ere pirates and makin' a free man of you again!" 
               For a considerable space there was yet no answer, and the Wrecker glared on those who were doing him that mistaken kindness, as if he scarcely saw or scarcely recognised them. Then he spoke, but his words seemed to come through set teeth, and neither his eyes nor a muscle of his face moved in sympathy: 
               "You are right-I don't thank you." 
               "You don't want to be free? You, Barney North, want to be carted away like a thief, and don't thank the old friends who've put themselves in a tight place to serve you!" said Uncle Zeke, his errant eyes so set in unusual motion by surprise that he might have been taking a solar observation with one and making a geological survey with the other, at that particular juncture. 
               "Well, that turns me keel upward, clean!" said Sim Radstock!-not elegantly, but graphically. "What do mean by it?-say, Barney North!" and for the moment Sim almost so far lost respect for him as to forget that he was little Charlotte's father-"Ain't you going to get out of that wagon?-Say!" 
               "No!" answered the Wrecker. 
               "He is crazy!" exclaimed Radstock and Robbins, each aside to the other, and almost in the same breath. "I tell you, Barney North," added Uncle Zeke, with one more faint hope of bringing him to his senses,-"get out of that d-d wagon and go home!" 
               "Home!" cried Barnard North, and the words seemed choked out, as before, in the mighty effort of a suffering heart to break and be once more at peace-"Home!-where is that? Home?-I have no home!" 
               "No home!-where is your cabin?" asked Uncle Zeke, who saw more and more confirmation of his suspicion. "Where is your wife? Where are your--" and he hesitated for an instant in the recollection of what had so lately occurred-"where are your children?" 
               "Home? wife? children? Oh, my God!-why will they treat me so cruelly!" broke from the agonized heart of the man who had himself never done a deed of cruelty in his whole life. Then he went on evidently speaking much more to himself than to any who heard. "What is my home?-a place I have made a hell! My children?-my noble boy is drowned. Rachael North says that I have murdered her child-her child, just as if he was not mine, too! Home?-no, I am never going home any more! Are these fellows never going to drive on?" 
               Apparently that rapt sense had seen or known nothing of the violence which had been committed. To bring about such a result of mental and bodily paralysis, through what an ordeal of torture must that big, manly, once happy heart have been passing! 
               All the shoremen became aware, now,-slowly, and as words of doubt and wonder circulated from mouth to mouth,-that that fearful breach of law and personal exposure to that law's vengeance, had been committed without result. In a moment after this conviction fairly forced itself upon them, the officers found themselves released. Every grasp seemed to have relaxed with the hope which had given it tension: there was no use holding them in durance longer, if Barnard North was determined to remain a prisoner. Hawkins, the Agent, too, found himself free-he scarcely knew when or how; though neither the muddy water from his clothes nor the rage from his heart shook off quite so easily as the violent hands which had held him! 
               "Will you get out of that wagon and come with us, Barney North?" asked Uncle Zeke, once more, as the shoremen stood ready to leave the scene of their triumph and discomfiture. 
               "No!" 
               Not another word was interchanged. No apologies-no promises-no threats: all that might have been and that might have been expected, was crushed away before the stony grief and madness of the bereaved man. Hawkins did not even curse, and Sim Radstock did not even double his huge fists with a threat of using them upon some one who stood in his way-two indications that something unusual had occurred, quite as conclusive as is the gathering together in amity of the beasts in the East Indian jungle, a proof that the blinding tempest of God's breath is abroad over the frightened land. 
               Slowly, sadly and silently, the whole body of shoremen took their way with bent heads, through the little belt of scrubby woodland, back towards the tavern. Then the driver once more mounted his seat, and the shivering and half-dead but indomitable Hawkins again took his place beside him. The constables, entirely uninjured, again took their seats beside the Wrecker on his straw, and the wagon slowly moved on towards its destination. Probably not more than a quarter of an hour had elapsed since its stoppage: certainly, no more profitless outrage had over been committed, unless, indeed, there was some compensation in Uncle Zeke having wreaked a part of his long-delayed vengeance on Insurance Agents,-and in Sim Radstock's having enjoyed an opportunity for proffering service, however little it availed, to the father of Charlotte North. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               BARNARD NORTH A PRISONER. 
               SLOWLY, on the evening of the same day of the attempted rescue, the wagon containing Barnard North and his captors rolled through the long muddy street of Clayboro, the local seat of government of Seaboard Country, within which lay Topsail beach and all its dependencies. A mile in length along the main street-pleasant in summer but most gloomy and desolate in winter, was Clayboro; the elms and sycamores which so pleasantly shaded the street at the one season, shedding their leaves in the most dismal and helpless manner in the fall, and preventing a melancholy spectacle of naked and complaining branches, as they writhed and groaned under the fierce winds of winter. 
               Hard clay, forming an unexceptionable trotting-ground for the jockeys and sporting-men of the town and neighborhood, was the main street when the summer weather had been fair for a week or the hard frost of winter stiffened it into the consistency of brick; but when the rains of autumn or the thaws of spring had disturbed its componency, a more hopeless mortar-bed through which horses must plunge or pedestrains founder, was never presented to the shuddering view. Two miles per hour along it, at such periods, would have been considered very respectable racing speed; and men with cattle weak of limb managed to have as little business as possible up and down that thoroughfare, at any time when passers-by were scarce or the murky state of the atmosphere made a signal of distress difficult to descry. There was a tradition among the last men of the neighborhood, doubted by some but emphatically endorsed by others, what a coal-carter from the Southern pines, finding himself and his team at about the centre of the street at sunset of one peculiarly muddy day in spring, and hopeless of extricating himself before dark-had complacently wrapped his muddy horse-blankets around him, lain down in the bottom of his smutty wagon, and slept calmly until morning, when he recommenced his journey with a successful deliverance. 
               Through such a chaos of mud, and under the wrestling limbs and over the fallen foliage of early October, the Wrecker was borne onward to the county Court-house and the county jail. A staring red brick building contained both, with a square barrack-roof and imitation columns of gray stone fronting the upper story, while no attempt had been made at a column for the benefit of the dingy piazza below. Damp, cold, uncomfortable, dirty, and cheerless generally was Clayboro Court-house; and the refractory free negroes and rough population of the section were believed to be much more influenced towards good behavior by the fear of getting into its dismal cells and windy passages, than by any dislike to confinement or dread of the disgrace accompanying. Two or three attempts had been made to burn it down-attempts which legal proclamation attributed to the prisoners who happened to be confined there at those special times, but which common rumor quite as confidently laid to the charge of certain public-spirited citizens of the less-scrupulous order, who considered the whole thing a blot on the landscape and a disgrace to the county town. It is unnecessary to say that the mouldering stone and brick and the timbers of sodden and half-rotten oak would not burn, under any moderate provocation, and that the only result brought about by the incendiary attempts was increased dilapidation and discomfort. For it was a well-known fact that when any public building or bridge in or about Clayboro, or indeed anywhere in the county, became damaged or out of order, the Board of Chosen Freeholders, who held the public purse-strings in their hands, at once commenced holding meetings to take the matter into consideration, and spent so much time and money in holding those meetings, and the adjourned meetings to which they gave rise, and the dinners which both demanded, that by the time they became ready to advertise for proposals for making the repairs, there were no funds left in the treasury to be applied to any such purpose, all parties had grown tired of the job and its discussions, and it went over to the next year and the new Board, who pursued the subject in the same energetic manner until they lost the papers and forgot it altogether. Much money was believed to be saved to the public purse by this system: there is no certainty but that if the county could have had two such Boards in power at one time, it might have gone untaxed, as the public property would certainly have remained unrepaired, until doomsday. 
               It was to quarters kept under supervision by such guardians of the public weal, and to the company of the men who usually haunt such abodes of crime and misery, that the lately generous, manly and free-limbed Wrecker of Topsail was about to be consigned! 
               Part of the civil force employed in the capture belonged at Clayboro, and necessarily the arrival was expected. Few residents of the town, except such as had business at the sea-shore, had ever seen Barnard North; but all had heard and known of him. Always, until the present time, they had heard and known of him as the type man of the shore section-the bravest, most devoted and noble of all whole cabins studded the beach line: now (and the time need not be long for changing the whole standing and position of the best man in the world)-now they were prepared to regard him as a dangerous and fearful man, wicked as powerful, hunted like a wild beast and fully deserving his treatment! 
               From the long wooden piazza of the "Washington House," which sported as a swinging sign an effigy of the Father of his Country, four times re-painted in different equestrian and forensic positions, a part of each washed away by the storms, and presenting a jumble of red, blue, green and yellow arms and legs, which might have been a dog-fight and might have been the Capture of Andre; from the front without any piazza, of the "Clayboro Hotel," over the way, which sported a swinging-sign still larger, with an improbable blue ship on red waves on the one side, and an equally improbable horse, with the neck considerably larger than the body, on the other side; from the gabled front of the "Seaboard House" (was there ever a country-town without as many as three taverns clustered in aggravating rivalry?)-thrust out contemptuously to the street and disdaining any sign except the name of the house and the cognomen of the proprietor, which perhaps ought to have been all-sufficient, seeing that the latter was Hoch Deutsch and of seven syllables; from the door of the dingy and dirty oyster-saloon, with its red balloon outside and suspicious eatables in the windows; from the doors of the half dozen stores on the same street, at which everything was sold (as at Squire Billy Holloway's, at the other end of the county,) from a plough to a gallon of molasses and a yard of tape by which to carry it; from the post-office which idle men visited ten times a-day for letters and papers which they did not expect, that they might have an excuse for looking over those of others and "seeing who had any;" from the tailor-shop, in the window of which, his legs cramped up on a three-feet sewing-board, the same lame tailor jerked his elbow or retailed scandal and shabby coats, during sixteen hours of every twenty-four; from every place fronting on the main street of Clayboro the idle lounged out towards the Court-house as the wagon with its tall prisoner drove up, hands in pockets and eyes and mouths alike distended, waiting to see the committal of "Old North, the Beach-Pirate," as he had already been named, during the last few days, by gossip and the newspapers. 
               The longers observed, as the wagon drew up at the iron gate of the Court-house yard, that Hawkins, the Agent, who had been very neatly dressed when he came down from the city,-had a mashed hat down over his eyes, clothes slimy and muddy, a face which seemed to have needed washing for a week, and a scowl upon his face, boding no good to that "some one" against whom his anger might happen to be directed. Their gaze, however, was more concentrated upon the tall man, of herculean figure, who sat on the straw at the bottom of the wagon, between the two constables. His rough felt that they observed to be drawn down even more closely than Hawkins', over the brows; and they could see that the heavy jaws were set with iron firmness, as if in pain. He did not move when the wagon stopped, and one of the constables was obliged to lay his hand upon the broad shoulder, to arouse him. 
               The head of Barnard North moved slightly, at the touch, and he turned a glance of stony coldness on the officer, which seemed to have the effect on that person of a basket of small icicles emptied down his back. 
               "Keep your hand off me!" was all the words he said, but it sounded dangerous; the event of the morning was not forgotten, and the constable involuntarily stepped backward for the length of an arm. 
               "What do you want of me?" continued the Wrecker, who at length seemed to see that the touch had been necessary and for a purpose. 
               "We want you to get out: this is the Court House," answered the constable. 
               "Humph!-if you want me out, take me out!" was the reply, not delivered as the mocking taunt in which the same invitation has often been given, but as if he no longer regarded himself as anything more than a piece of inanimate matter, to be carried about wherever wanted, but alike lacking power, will and obligation to move itself. 
               The reply was, however, considered a witticism by the crowd assembled within hearing; and as they regarded the stalwart figure of Barnard North, and calculated that his weight was more than two hundred pounds a coarse laugh ran around the circle, with remarks like: "Good for the pirate!" "A nice little load to move!" "Yes, take him out and carry him, Brown!" and other equally delicate drolleries. Once more, then, the Wrecker slowly swept with his eye the faces and figures surrounding him, and upon each who caught his eye fell a sudden silence, for hatred and scorn were not more marked in that glance than was the black despair which scorned life and defied death; and we often pay to recognised suffering a reverence like that accorded by savage nations to the mentally unfortunate-a reverence too often denied to unobtrusive virtue and goodness. 
               Barnard North had yet made no movement to leave the wagon, and the officers be- gan to grow impatient, especially as Hawkins, who had already made calls which they were denied, at the three taverns intervening between Topsail village and Clayboro, had at once sprung from his seat on their arrival, and was endeavoring, with a glass of hot toddy at the "Clayboro House," to wash out the remainder of the slimy brook water introduced into his throat during the ducking. 
               But at this moment the Sheriff of the County approached-a stout man with bald head and benevolent face, who had been closeted with a party of friends at the "Washington," "transacting some kind of county business," the bar-keeper said to those who had asked after him during his disappearance, though the chambermaid, clearing up the room an hour or two after, found a strong smell of evaporated whiskey therein, as well as a piece of lemon peel, a ten cent piece, and the eight of spades, all under the table. 
               Filling though he did an office recognised as requiring a hard and unbending man to hold it to his own and the public advantage-Sheriff Parker was warm-hearted and generous, too fond of political life and its surroundings, and by far a better steward of the interests of others than he had ever been of his own-a fact which Wall Street bankers and Broadway merchants, whose motto declares this an impossibility, will be slow to believe. Whether he performed the last painful duty imposed by law, in taking the forfeit life of a murderer-or saw to the closing of a door which shut in some miserable being from the outer world for many a long month and perhaps for ever-or went through the cruel legal forms which broke up the worldly prosperity of some unfortunate debtor,-he did each of his offices with a kind and sorrowing heart, as well as with a courtesy of speech and manner rare in that time and section, ever wishing that his errand could have been one of kindness and benefit instead of punishment or constraint. He had a weakness for punch and division-loo, which eventually told heavily against his private fortune; but when all was gone or only the wreck remaining, he yet retained one fortune of no mean value-the kindly regard and noble pity of all with whom he had been associated. 
               Such was the man who advanced to the wagon containing the captive, waved off with his hand and an imperative movement of the head those who had approached too closely, and said kindly, addressing the prisoner: 
               "Mr. Barnard North, I suppose?" 
               "That is my name," answered the Wrecker, apparently surprised at being so respectfully addressed. 
               "Will you do me the favor to alight? This is the Court-house, and it is my duty to beg that you will put yourself under my charge, as the Sheriff of the County." 
               "The Court-house-you are the Sheriff-you want me to go with you-to jail," he responded, speaking forcibly and by jerks, as if his words came from some influence outside of himself. 
               "Yes," said the Sheriff, "such is unfortunately my duty until you have an opportunity to clear yourself of the charges made against you, which I have no doubt are altogether false." 
               It is worthy of note that Sheriff Parker had a somewhat indiscriminate habit of declaring his belief in the innocence of persons accused, but that his single glance at the whole manner and bearing of Barnard North really impressed him with the belief that the shoreman was a person of true heart and noble spirit, the victim of circumstances, unfortunate and ill-used. 
               "Humph!-I thank you for your good opinion," was the reply of the Wrecker North, and without another word he rose from his position in the wagon, sprang nimbly though heavily over the side, and was ready to accompany the Sheriff. One of the constables made a motion to take hold of his clothes, but the Sheriff waved him off with a gesture which happily the Wrecker did not perceive. 
               "Be so kind as to take my arm," said the good-natured official, and together they walked up the Court-house yard to the building, followed by most of the crowd who had witnessed that singular debarkation. Hawkins had finished his supplementary toddy and returned, in time to join them at the porch, where a regretful remark on the part of the Sheriff at the appearance of his clothes induced half a dozen muttered oaths and prepared the Agent to be much more intractable than he might otherwise have thought necessary. 
               The Wrecker was taken into the reception-room, used as a room for grand-jury conference on the opening days of the terms of court,-only those concerned in the arrest being admitted so far into the penetralia of the house of justice. 
               "You have no doubt seen the warrant for your arrest, Mr. North," said the Sheriff, in a tone as apologetic as if he had been pleading for good treatment after an offence he had himself committed-"and it becomes my unpleasant duty to keep you in confinement here until the meeting of the court at November term." 
               "I know it-keep me!" was the sententious reply of the Wrecker. 
               "With only this frivolous charge against you-" the Sheriff commenced to add, when he was interupted by Hawkins. 
               "Frivolous charge! Frivolous charge, indeed!" said the harsh voice of that worthy, not yet too much softened by the toddy. "Heading a gang of shore-pirates, stealing valuable property, and assaulting an officer of the customs-if you call that a frivolous charge--". 
                
               But in his turn the Agent was interrupted. 
               "A lying charge, and you are one of the liars!" said Barnard North, in a low and concentrated tone that seemed to come from his broad throat without the opening of his mouth; and though he made no movement to fell the Agent as he had done once before, his nervous hand at that moment clutched itself together with a grip that would have ground to atoms any substance of ordinary tenacity. 
               "Gentlemen! gentlemen!" expostulated the sheriff, as if two of his bosom-friends had fallen into a trifling dispute and he was afraid of something worse. 
               "I mean what I say!" answered Hawkins, doggedly. 
               "And I!" responded Barnard North, in a tone not more amiable. 
               "Never mind," said the Sheriff, "I was going to say that, the commitment being made on so slight a charge, if you, Mr. North, will give me your word of honor that you will make no attempt at escape--" 
               "I protest against any such arrangement!" put in Hawkins, who knew what was coming and still tasted the salty slime in his mouth. 
               "And as Sheriff of the County, Mr. Agent-what's your name?" suavely said the Sheriff, who could be dignified on occasion-"I must be allowed to do my own business in my own way. When you come to be shut up-" 
               "I!" echoed the Agent. 
               "Yes, you," answered the Sheriff, where at there was some disposition to laugh on the part of the constables. "When you come to be shut up-ha! ha! you may do as you like about taking a cell or remaining outside-that is, you may be allowed to do so; but now-" 
               "What do you mean, sir-r-r!" and Hawkins' voice fairly rolled and whirled with indignation. 
               "I mean," said the Sheriff, blandly as ever, "to give this gentleman a chance to be more comfortable than he would be in a cell." 
               "Infamous!" said the Agent. 
               "Sorry you think so!" answered the Sheriff, and then he turned his attention again entirely to the prisoner. "I was going to say, Mr. North, that if you will give me your word of honor to make no attempt at escape-" 
               "He made no attempt at escaping from the wagon, coming up-even when he might have done it just as well as not," said one of the constables. 
               "If you will give me that promise," the Sheriff went on, "I shall be justified in not committing you to a cell, but giving you the freedom of the interior of the jail." 
               "I shall give you no such promise!" said Barnard North, in that cold, hard voice which it seemed that no kindness could melt. 
               "You will not!" responded Sheriff Parker, naturally surprised. 
               "No!" answered the Wrecker. "I have been dragged here like a pirate and a thief: use me like one, and have done with it!" 
               "He knows himself and what usage he deserves, better than any one else can do!" sneered Hawkins. 
               "Humph!" said the accused man, in a tone of contempt and scorn. 
               "I say, once more," said the Sheriff, "that if Mr. North will give me his word-" 
               "And I say that I will not!" again and more petulantly spoke the Wrecker. 
               "In that case," continued the Sheriff, "though I shall very much regret the necessity, I have but one course. I shall be obliged to commit you to one of the cells, Willis," to a turnkey who was within the room, "is not No. 20 one of the cleanest and most comfortable?" 
               "I think so, Sheriff," answered Willis. 
               "Then get the key, and come with us." 
               Five minutes afterwards the Wrecker of Topsail, whose free limbs had never yet since manhood known one moment of forcible restraint before that unfortunate day, entered his prison cell. The Sheriff, the turnkey and one of the constables went in with him. His stony gaze relaxed for a moment, and his eye seemed to rove around and take in all the details of the miserable apartment which was to be his abode until the law should free him from injustice or consign him to a worse and more loathsome prison. 
               Few there are-sad proof of the universality of crime and suffering!-few there are of any age and experience, who have not, in one place or another, looked on the inside of the gloomy and loathsome walls of a prison-foul from the continual damp and mouldiness which comes with the absence of heaven's sunlight; rank with odors that seem to have been left behind them by all the squalid, the guilty and the unfortunate who have there made their abode until they went forth to freedom or a worse punishment; dismal with the unending and unvaried sight of cold stone and rusted iron; hideous with the knowledge that it is for the time a living tomb in which those who have died from human respect by the reality or the suspicion of crime, are to be entombed. Few there are, as we have said, who have not seen the inside of a prison cell, enclosing themselves or some one in whom their hearts held painful interest; and a dungeon in one place is a dungeon in another, except as a Black Hole of Calcutta may occasionally arise to dwarf the horrors of a Bastile; and over the doors of one and all are written these words, much plainer than the old Italian poet saw the farewell to hope inscribed above the gates of the Inferno,-"Misery and disgrace to all who enter here and occupy!-they go not out as they came-between them and the world henceforth exists a barrier that can never again be overleaped." 
               No. 20 of the jail at Clayboro had a door of heavy oaken wood, stapled and barred with iron, and with a loop-hole of six inches square, through which the criminal could gaze or be stared at during the hours of daylight;-a single high window, with its crossed bars of massive iron; a low wooden bedstead with a thin straw mattress and a coarse dingy cotton coverlet; a stool, and one or two clumsy vessels of earthen. 
               Barnard North did not shrink at the prospect as for the first time in his life he entered a prison cell. He seemed to see all in a moment and with a single glance around; then his gaze grew cold and stony again. 
               "Never mind the Agent," said the kind-hearted Sheriff, as they passed within. "Give me your word not to attempt to escape-I want no oath from such a man as I believe you to be!-and the freedom of the jail and the whole Court-house is yours, with much better lodging than I can possibly afford you here." 
               "Once more-no!" was the cold, hard and apparently thankless reply of the Wrecker, who did not seem capable, then, of being thawed back to humanity by any ray of even extraordinary kindness. 
               "You shall be made as comfortable as possible, here, then," continued the Sheriff, who represented the other side of the mental condition and apparently could not be hardened. "Willis, see that the mattress is changed, and tell your wife to bring some more bed-clothes. And now evening is coming and I have some other business to attend to, Mr. North. Make yourself as comfortable as possible, and I'll see you early to-morrow. Good night!" 
               "It is all good enough for a thief and a pirate. Take no trouble on my account. Good night!" This was all the reply that even the continual warmth and kindness of the good official could draw out from the hopelessly-frozen human fountain. 
               Sheriff Parker and the turnkey left the cell; the door clashed to with a grating, jarring sound and the noise of the shooting of heavy bolts into their sockets; the half dozen of squalid heads of detenus in the other cells fell away from the holes where they had exhibited themselves; the crowd who had gathered at the Court-house door and streamed within slowly dispersed to other business (or other amusement); and the Wrecker of Topsail, over whose brow for so many years had played the healthful breezes of the Atlantic, while he toyed with the free waves as with a plaything-breathed the damp, confined, loathsome air of a prison. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               THE SYMPATHY OF THE SEA-COAST. 
               IT has been said that no attempt could be made to describe the misery and desolation in which the family of Barnard North were left, when the husband and father was dragged away to jail. Yet that attempt must be made; for desolate and hopeless as they were, many a household over the broad earth feels the same measure of misery every day that we rise in comfort and freedom and the blessed absence of outrage and bereavement! But a few days had passed since the very spirit of humble happiness nestled among the Wrecker's household; now, the cup of wretchedness seemed already nearly full, without the shuddering lips being at all prepared for the draught by preceding circumstances. It yet remained to be seen how much could be added before that cup of misery really became full to running over. 
               Bitter was the self-reproach that fell upon Rachael North when she realized how utterly broken and changed, in so short a time, had become the lover of her youth-the husband of her happy middle age. Dear to her as her boy had been-terrible as had been the agonized wail breaking from heart and lips when she knew that his dear form was drifting lifeless among the white-capped waves of the sea or lying in deadly slumber on the sands of its bed-the memory came back to her, before any long time had elapsed, that there was something more in the world, even than her child. Her husband-her brave, noble, generous husband: had not her wild reproaches done even more than his bereavement to drive him into that state of stony madness? Had she but remembered the generous errand on which her boy had been led out to death, and remembered, too, that the son was his as well as her own-had she mingled her grief with his, instead of overloading his almost bursting heart with useless reproaches-had she striven, yet, to make his home that place of refuge from all wrong and unkindness which it had been in other days, all might not yet have been lost! Then, too, had not that unfortunate purchase of silk for an unaccustomed mourning, made without his knowledge or consent, given excuse for the search and the seizure, her husband might still have remained with her, the fountain of grief for their dead son might after a time have flowed gently if it did not dry altogether, and once more the vision of their lost happiness might have returned, chastened but sanctified. 
               Ah, self-reproaches!-how surely ye come at some stage of every mistake and every wrong! How surely, too, ye come when the angel has gone by-when it is forever too late for useful act or amelioration! There are those, it is to be believed, who think that they offer some atonement for the past wrong in the present sorrow; but they err: neither duty nor necessity pays any debt beyond that required at its hands for the mental outlay of that very moment! 
               Such were the feelings of Rachael North as she saw the wagon that bore her husband move away from the door of her cabin-as her children gathered around her and clung to the folds of her dress, asking, with wondering eyes and choking sobs, as mere infants might have done, "what they were going to do with father," and "if he would ever come back." How could the desolate wife and mother answer? How could she know what was to be the issue of all this violence? 
               Perhaps the saddest sight of all was the Wrecker's daughter-poor little Charlotte North. Old enough to have been a stay and comfort to her mother in that dark hour, but evidently weak beyond hope-weeping and sobbing and wringing her delicate little hands until it sometimes seemed that they would be dislocated or disfigured, and uttering words of such painfully childish grief and sorrow that she might have been believed a child often, instead of a girl of sixteen, verging on womanhood. 
               But the Wrecker's wife was not left to bear her grief and fear without companionship and sympathy. Residence in the country has its disadvantages, as compared with abode in the great city-especially when eyery detail of household work is pried into through the window or over the wall of the back yard, or an inventory of the family numbers and cleanliness taken by keeping count of the clothes on the line hanging out over the lawn from the wash-room, or the street-door watched to see the face of every visitor who enters and time him by the clock as he goes away. All these are disadvantages; but there are compensations. No one grieves, or suffers, or starves, alone and without helpful sympathy, unless by wilful withdrawal of self from the chance of meeting it. A famishing next-door neighbor does not often agonize over the aroma of the roast meats being served for dinner so near him; nor does the dance go on and the music sound and the carriages dash up and drive away all night, at one house, while in the very next a corpse is lying with closed ears and stiffened feet, and around it the mourners weeping blood from their hearts as the hot, scalding tears fall from their fevered eyes. No-God bless the country for this, amid the curses that will ever be hurled against its narrow-minded bigotry and its injurious intermeddling: it has communion, and sympathy, and assistance for the suffering! 
               Several of the wives of the fishermen from the neighboring cottages came in, that day, to tell the wife of the Wrecker the sorrow which they felt for the woman so suddenly and doubly bereaved. And no hollow and empty expressions of sorrow were theirs-such as too often, in the visits of condolence of the fashionable world make it doubtful whether the visitor most wishes to express an actual sympathy, or to satisfy an idle curiosity. Warm hearts have the women of the coast, in almost every locality where the roar of the surf blends with the hum of civilization; and not a few of those who stepped over the threshold of Rachael North that day, brought some little article of home luxury in their hands, as if they believed that even grief and shame would be less poignant if the body was properly comforted. 
               They found the hopeless woman sitting in the inner room of the cottage, buried in such grief as not many of them had ever before witnessed, her face hidden in her hands, and the hot tears of grief and self-reproach trickling through her fingers, while the choking sobs that racked her whole being were scarcely restrained. Poor Charlotte, sick with sorrow, fear and weakness, had sobbed herself nearly into insensibility, and lay curled up on a homely lounge, (little more than a covered bench) that occupied one corner of the apartment. 
               In their own rude and untutored way (sometimes the most effective that even art could devise) the women attempted to console their stricken and grieving sister. 
               "Barney North will soon come back to you, Rachael!" said kind-hearted Mary Collins, the Plump, handsome and radiant little black-eyed wife of Sam Collins, a fisherman just then absent up the coast,-herself well known in all the neighborhood as the unpretending angel of the sick-room, and the consoler of all who chanced to fall into trouble, whatever their errors or their faults. "Barney North will soon come back to you," the little woman repeated, smoothing the hair of the sufferer as if she could thus charm away the trouble from her brain. "Everybody knows that he is too noble to steal; and when they come to know all about it, they will know that he did just what he ought to ha' done, in knocking down the good-for-nothing whelp that insulted him!" 
               "So I say!" chimed in Polly Brown, who was an echo of her neighbor, never doing anything of her own will and judgment, but always following beneficially where led by her idol. "It will all be right, Rachael, depend upon it-when the truth comes to be known." 
               "The truth may never be known!" broke out the wretched woman, the flood-gates of whose feelings were at once opened by this sympathy. "He may die in prison, as many have done before him. My boy is drowned; my husband is crazy and gone to prison! Oh, I am the most wretched woman in the world, and I don't see why God will punish me so!" 
               "Everybody says that when they have a bit of trouble; and I don't blame you," said Mary Collins, still smoothing and patting the pained head with both her gentle hands. "Have a good cry, dear, and then you will feel better." 
               Perhaps nothing could have been said, so well calculated to cheek the grief and rouse the spirit of Rachael North, as this kind woman, a little her inferior, always, in social position (ah, they have "social position" and the different strata of society, good people, on the wild sea-coast as well as along the fashionable streets of the metropolis!), playing mentor and treating her something as she might have done a child. Besides, there is something in company and consoling words; and some remembrance of her early education and that trust in Providence which had never before forsaken her, came back to the sorrowful wife. She allowed herself to be persuaded, by degrees, that the law was not always inconsistent with justice, and that her husband might indeed at no distant day be restored to liberty and to her. 
               The wife of the Wrecker was about at this poise between hope and despair, when there occurred a single new arrival which put a different face on the whole matter and neutralised all the good which the visitors had done. Mrs. Pheny (supposed, though not conclusively, to be Euphemia) Chasey, the type female gossip of Topsail, as Major Jeff Taddlewick was the male-long-legged, thin of frame and sharp of feature, with a pair of gray eyes which could peep and lighten with equal facility,-came flying in at the door, her bonnet half off her head and her shawl hanging by one corner, with: 
               "Oh, Mrs. North!-oh, neighbors!-you don't know what goings on there have been up at the village! I'm afraid your husband, Mrs. North, is gone, now, to a certainty! Though to be sure, he never was of much account-never good enough for you: but-" 
               "Hold your tongue!" flamed Mary Collins, but the warning was useless at that period. Rachael North had apparently heard the first part of the sentence but ignored the remainder; and she tottered up from her chair, just as Charlotte screamed out: "Poor father!-what are they going to do with him and what will become of us all!" and relapsed into her helplessness and sobbing. 
               "What-my God!-what has happened now?" cried the wretched wife. 
               "Oh, they have had a fight up at the Ditch, and that precious husband of yourn, if you will own him for a husband, has killed one of the officers, and they have tied him neck-and-heels and took him on up to prison, where he'll be hung, sure-though none of us will think the worse of you, Mrs. North-you can't help it!" 
               "Hold your tongue!" again spoke Mary Collins, with a still stronger emphasis on the last word; but it was again too late-the mischief was done. 
               "Killed a man!-my husband a murderer! Oh my God!-this was all that was wanting, to kill me!" exclaimed the stricken wife. She staggered a moment-made a clutch at the air as if she saw some supporting form in it-then fell headlong and senseless to the floor in the middle of the room, while Charlotte sprang up with another scream and the exclamation-"There-mother is dead!" and tumbled down beside her. 
               "I do wonder if they really will hang him!" Mrs. Chasey added, in a tone expressive of the curiosity which no doubt she felt, as she certainly felt nothing else! 
               "Look what you have done, with that long tongue of yours, Pheny Chasey!" said Mary Collins, dropping on her knees and raising the head of the fallen woman, who was entirely insensible. "Get some water, quick, some of you!" 
               "Yes, just look what you have done, with that everlastin' long tongue, always a gabblin' and a backbitin'!" echoed Polly Brown, who had dropped down to raise the other head (that of Charlotte), but amended by carrying the girl bodily to her lounge and dropping her there. 
               "Yes, you've done just enough!" said Miss Betsey Morris, a tall and rather stout old maid of thirty-five or forty, with heavy dark brows but very sweet brown eyes under them-a rugged face but a good one, and hands that might have belonged to a man, for size and sinewy character. "Pheny Chasey, I just believe that whole story's a lie, and that the devil sent you here to torment the poor critter!" 
               "Me lie? me?-you nasty old thing!-" 
               "Pheny Chasey," and the voice of the stout spinster trembled. So did her hands, trembled and clutched, only Mrs. Chasey did not see them. "Pheny Chasey, just put on your bonnet and go home, before you say another word, or you'll wish you had!" 
               "Pooh! who cares for you? I won't stir a step till I get ready, you miserable old critter that's been running after all the men, and couldn't-" 
               Perhaps Miss Betsey Morris really had been anxious to secure a husband, any time during the previous twenty years, but that constituted no reason for her being taunted with the fact in that immediate connection. And such allusions are not pleasant, to either sex, whatever the provocation. Miss Morris' heavy eye-brows met in the middle. That phenomenon meant mischief, in the eyes of those who knew her best, for she was not in the habit of speaking without being ready to act out the "faith that was in her." 
               "You won't go, eh? Now just you get out of this house as quick as you can, or I'll help you!" 
               "Touch me if you dare, you black-faced fright!" 
               In about the space of thirty seconds there- after, Miss Betsey Morris had made what might be called (in sea-shore parlance) a "dive" at the gossip, caught her round the waist, and slung her through both doors into the little door-yard in front-the second who had been ejected through the same doors that day, by different sexes, and yet in the same quarrel. When fairly out of the door and no blow as yet interchanged, the evil genius of Mrs. Pheny Chasey enabled her to struggle hard enough in her antagonist's vigorous embrace, to free her right hand and visit her with a sounding slap on the cheek, while she poured out epithets which we have no occasion to chronicle. Her evil genius, certainly; for in an incredibly short space of time following, while the gossip succeeded in scratching the face of the spinster, enough to enrage her and disfigure her a little for a week or two-the bonnet of Mrs. Pheny Chasey was torn into shreds; her hair sent flying about her ears, in defiance of side-combs and all such means of confinement; and the hands of Miss Betsey Morris, first the right then the left, applied to the two sides of her head with such vigorous and sounding slaps as must have left her with a confused notion of her where abouts and even her identity. 
               A couple of minutes placed the garrulous lady hors du combat, and sent her off up the causeway village-ward, with flying "colors" in one sense if not in another, her upper-clothing being reduced to "strseamers,"-and with muttered threats and shakings of the fist towards her triumphant antagonist, which the latter regarded with about the same proportion of fear and trembling that the Hudson River palisades would dis play when a drunken Irishman threatened to dig them down with his shovel! 
               Then Miss Betsey returned to the house, with a parting admonition addressed to her discomfited foe, which the latter was not very likely to hear at her distance: "Call me an 'old maid,' will you, Pheny Chasey! Next time you do it, and tell any more of your lies around where I am, Bill Chasey won't know you from a bag-full of butcher's-meat when you go home,-mind that!" 
               Rachael North, meanwhile, had been raised from the floor, borne laboriously up the narrow stair, and laid on her bed of loneliness. She was insensible to all words spoken, and yet retained a painful consciousness, for her lips kept muttering what no one could understand. Half an hour afterwards she was permanently an occupant of that bed, with ice around her head, delirious, and with every indication of brain-fever, while still she occasionally moaned out a few words, of which those who attended upon her could recognize: 
               "Killed a man-Barnard-my God!-going to hang my husband!" 
               Mary Collins, regardless of any need of her that might exist at her own house, at once installed herself a nurse and housekeeper, with some difficulty scolding and coaxing Charlotte into an assistant. The poor girl, recovered from her first fright, seemed to be anxious to do anything that lay in her power, but to display no energy of character or will, and to be totally useless except as continually directed. The rest of the women prepared to go homeward, one or two of them to return on the morrow and assist in the care of the sufferer, and Miss Betsey Morris (of their number) to make some corrections in her own deranged toilet and conceal so far as possible the marks made on her face by the ghoul-like claws of Mrs. Pheny Chasey. 
               But before night Dick Decker, Uncle Zeke Robbins and two more of those who had been concerned in the affray with Hawkins, came down to the cabin in a fish-wagon. From them Mary Collins and the family learned what had really occurred at the Ditch, though poor Rachael North was far beyond the reach of any immediate explanation. 
               "They'll have the whole of us, for that job, before many days, I expect!" said Dick Decker, after relating the exploit and its failure, "and I thought that before they got us and maybe shut us up till November, we'd just look down and see how Barney's folks were getting along." 
               "Poor enough!" said Mary Collins; and she related the Chasey falsehood and its effect. 
               "Blast all sich she-suckers as that!" was the emphatic comment of Uncle Zeke. "They're wuss than Insurance Agents; and them's the meanest things I ever knowed besides!" 
               "Worse than stingarees!" replied Dick. "And I wish there wasn't a law against cuttin' out their mouths when we catch em, as we do with the skaits!" 
               No visit of idle curiosity, either, was that of Decker and his companions, in which Sim Radstock would unquestionably have taken part, but for the timidity (strange quality in so colossal, bold and rough a fellow!) which made him more easy anywhere else than in the presence of his child-idol, when suffering. 
               Their errand was, to enquire into the immediate circumstances of the family of the Wrecker, and to offer any aid that seemed to be really necessary. What might be the fate that should fall upon himself and the other actors, in the violence of that day, Decker was likely not to know very nearly or to care at all; but he was far-seeing enough to be aware that the sudden deprivation to the family, of its head, and the stoppage of the process of Barnard North's labor on the fishing-grounds, might seriously embarrass them, if it did not plunge them into actual suffering. It was not likely, (and that the other shoremen well knew,) that this man, winning his bread, like themselves, by the un-remunerative toil of the fishing-boat, and the ill-paid labor of wrecking for the Under-writers, and with a hand ever open to give to those poorer than himself-could have laid by anything beside the mere house and lot he occupied, against a day of disability. 
               "Anything in the house?" Decker asked, drawing Mary Collins away a little distance, out of earshot of the others. 
               "Yes-some provisions in the closets, and a kit of fish, and another of beef in the pantry," was the reply. "And there's near three dollars of silver in an old black tea-pot up there on the top shelf. I think that's about all they have got, though neither Charlotte (poor thing!) or the boys, seem to know anything about how they are situated." 
               "Better than nothing, Mrs. Collins-better than nothing," said Dick. "But it won't probably last half as long as they keep Barney shut up. Is she very sick, do you think?" 
               "Very sick-fever in the head-troublesome always," said the home-angel. 
               "You are going to tend her?" 
               "I guess I am!" was the spirited remark, accompanied by a look at Decker, which implied that she should like to know when she did not attend at any sick-bed within a mile of the little hamlet. 
               "Yes, I knowed you would," said Dick. "You're always doin' something of the kind, Mrs. Collins." 
               "Hold your tongue, about that!" said Mary Collins, modestly, though she did not look as if much displeased. 
               "Well, here is a little money that Uncle Zeke and the rest of us made up as we come along-" 
               "Hold your slack, Dick Decker!" broke in Uncle Zeke, who had evidently been listening. (Poor Decker seemed to be commanded to hold his peace, by everybody, just then!) "What does Mary Collins care who give it, so that poor Barney's family gets it?" and the old man took that opportunity for surveying the whitewashing of the ceiling with one eye while he examined the chairs and rag-carpeting of the room with the other. 
               "-That Uncle Zeke and the rest of us made up as we come along," repeated Decker, heedless of the interruption; and he handed Mary a handful of silver which may have contained eight or ten dollars. "When that is out, we'll try another haul." 
               "If I wasn't an old married woman and Sam away, so that I have to behave myself, I'd kiss you, Dick Decker, and you too, Uncle Zeke!" said Mary Collins, as she dropped the handful of silver into the teapot and replaced it on the shelf. "Now we shall get along nicely." 
               "Yes, if poor Mrs. North doesn't get any worse," said Decker; "and if she does-why we must do the best we must do the best we can for her-that's all. But where are the boys?" 
               Barnard and William, the two remaining sons of the bereaved couple, were loitering-sadly at the door, in that listless state so natural to the half-man and half-boy when death, serious illness or heavy misfortune is in the house; and they came up at once at the call of Mary Collins. 
               "You can't row much, but you can pull a bass or cod-line I b'lieve, Barney?" Decker said, addressing the eldest. 
               "Yes sir, a little-pretty well, father says, when I'm with him," answered the boy, his voice falling almost into tears at the close of the sentence, as he realised yet more deeply the absence. 
               "It won't do for you two young ones to go off with the boat, alone, or there might be more mischief," Decker went on. "Willie, here, is large enough to do all the chores that will be necessary about the house-suppose you go with me, Barney, and see what you can catch in my boat when I have an empty seat." He did not say, however he thought, that by this arrangement, too, there would be one mouth less to feed and one unfortunate less to care for, in the broken household of Barnard North, while its unfortunate head was languishing in a prison! 
               "If you have room for me, and if mother isn't too sick for me to leave her, I should like to go with you," replied the mannerly boy. 
               "We'll see about all that!" said Decker. And in a few minutes it was so arranged-that young Barnard North was to accompany Decker in the morning, and do the little in his power to provide for the necessities of his family. For the rest the generous-hearted shoremen intended to provide, to the last cent at their disposal, so long as poverty and sorrow hung above those who held such a claim to their exertion. Then the party, so prompt in either violent or benevolent action, took their way homeward, leaving a first night of the absence of father and head to fall upon the household of the Wrecker. Leaving Rachael North to suffer in semi-insensibility; and the Doctor from the village to wonder whether that terrible shock to the brain had not been sufficient to unseat reason and sap the very foundations of life; and Charlotte to mourn weakly and wander around the house with no purpose; and Mary Collins to pursue that work of unostentatious kindness for which the sheaves of reward already began to pile in to the golden granary of heaven, gathered by the sickles and borne home by the wings of angels. 
               Weeks were to roll over the cottage of Barnard North, before its mistress recovered from the repeated shocks she had experienced-weeks during which that kindness of her neighbors would not fail, as it must not. For in the thick-gathering troubles, not half of which had yet spent their force on the head of the devoted family, there needed the patient help of man as well as the goodness of God, to preserve life and reason. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               WHAT CHARLEY DENNISTON BAGGED ON THE TOPSAIL MARSHES. 
               IT will be remembered that young Charley Denniston, when he left the office of Squire Holloway on the day of the arrest, did not do so until he had accepted an invitation to dine with the Squire at an early day and be introduced to his daughter. But something not then noted may now be put upon record-that the young man's stay on the coast was not likely to be a long one, and that when he accepted the invitation he did so for a very early day indeed-no later than two days after! To "trust no future, howe'er pleasant" is a very good rule, in love-making as well as in gold speculations on Wall street; and the lover, incipient or fully established, who can calmly submit to a longer interval before the next sight of his mistress, when a shorter one can just as well be arranged, deserves never to have another loving woman nearer than at telescopic distance, for the balance of his natural life! Charley Denniston, though young and modest, had not that fault, let us be assured; and perhaps we may be able to forgive him some few others. 
               After the failure of his errand with the Squire, the young man hurried back to Topsail beach and the cottage of the Wrecker, to find that the second arrest had been accomplished and that the wagon containing the prisoner had moved off on its way towards Clayboro. Then his heart failed him, so far as any hope of immediate aid to the wronged Wrecker was concerned, and he went slowly back to his lodgings at the Eagle Tavern in Topsail, with his brain so filled with sorrow over the hard fate of one whom he believed to be an innocent man, and joy over the discovery of a new human (female) gem whom he felt very like "mining out"-that he had, at times, very indefinite ideas whether he was walking or flying-whether the road of sand-loam over which he travelled lay in Seaboard, Tophet or Arcadia. 
               Hawkins, who also held his temporary domicile at the Eagle, was gone away to Clayboro, wet, muddy and malicious; and it was only after reaching the tavern that the young man became aware of the events which had occurred at the Ditch, with so promising a beginning and so impotent a conclusion. The Agent, whether he remained at Clayboro for the purpose of finishing out the purification of his throat diffiled with ditch-water, or whether he was keeping watch over the building that contained his caged bird, did not return to Topsail during the day following; and Charley Denniston, who could not think of revisiting Squire Holloway's until the time set by invitation, and who could not be expected to take much pleasure in the low company, bad liquor and stale tobacco-smoke of the bar-room, fell into a resource which may not have reflected much credit on his strength of mind or acuteness of moral perception-what the sporting men designate as "shooting," the good people of the country sections, "gunning." 
               The salt marshes and meadows below Topsail, seaward, were reputed to be the haunt of innumerable descriptions and untold quantities of game birds, which it was alleged that any sportsman could bag by the dozen brace in a few hours; and every spring and fall marvellously-attired gentlemen came down from the great city, with guns only one remove in excellence from those of Manton or Westley Richards, with game-bags of great capacity, and with dogs whose intelligence would have put him of Montargis to the canine blush. Then the popping of guns could be heard for miles in every direction, and people traversing the roads needed sharp watch to avoid being caught in range of a charge of Spring Valley shot, No. 6. Legend said that they generally enjoyed "great sport," and no doubt they did so. The "oldest inhabitant" was alleged once to have dined off the contents of a game-bag locally filled by one of these gentry; but the then existing generation had been unfortunate, and the nearest approach to great sporting success, in memory in the neighborhood, was the case of a pale and intellectual looking gentleman who had "shot" all day without injuring a feather, accidentally popped over his own dog at night-fall, and been so affected in mind by the incident as to go away the next morning without remembering to pay his bill at the tavern. 
               Such was the sporting promise of the Topsail marshes; but into beating them, with a gun borrowed from his landlord and without any dog except such as followed and barked at him from the different houses,-young Charley Denniston was tempted (from the ennui of a dull day and the absence of Hawkins); as many another young man has been induced to do, in the hot blood of youth, that of which he was heartily ashamed when he had grown older and wiser. 
               This same Charley Denniston, let it be understood, has not been introduced into this veracious narrative with any intention of subjecting him to ridicule, however much some of his actions may demand the use of the risible faculties. As a consequence, it is impossible that his adventures on that day of amateur sporting should be fully record- ed-how he fired at birds something less than half a mile in distance, without any appreciable damage to the feathered tribe; how he spent a quarter of an hour, in one instance, attempting to get within range of a desultory but unfrightened bird of limited dimensions, to discover at last that his flint (percussion caps had then been scarcely invented) had all the while been missing from the lock; how be grew so intent on the pursuit of one covey of game as to pay little attention to his feet and fall into a treacherous pond-hole to the depth of his knees; and how, late in the afternoon and after an amount of exertion which should have fitted him (at a later day), to follow the Pathfinder up the most difficult of the Rocky Mountains, he at last bagged a bird, genus snipe, species sandpiper, weighing two ounces avoirdupois, including feathers, and so thin in body as to create the suspicion, when his condition of flesh was examined, that he must have been for sometime previously consumptive or otherwise invalided, rendering him weak of wing and limb and liable to easy capture. 
               Propriety, and the respect due to a hero, render it impossible to carry this description more closely into particulars. Enough to say that, thoroughly famished, weary of leg and with his one snipe in bag, the young man reached the Eagle Tavern at nightfall, to find that Hawkins had not even yet returned. As he passed in through the bar-room, intent upon seeking his room and the aid of a wash basin before supper, the irrepressible Rod, Squire Holloway's clerk and factotum, was just coming out, after transacting some business with which he had been entrusted, with one of the habitus of the place. 
               The young neophyte in the temple of legal drollery of course recognised the New Yorker at once, as he was just then one of the celebrities of the gossiping-village; and a recollection of the affecting episode of the Widow Benson, the day before, perhaps conjoined with the memory of the pretty girl below that office, made the recognition as instantaneous on the part of Denniston. Rod had probably seen thin game-bags before: at all events his mischievous eyes lighted up with delicious malice, as he asked: 
               "Eh, been gunning, Mr. Denniston! What luck?" 
               "Humph! about what might have been expected-nothing. That is, one bird, and I forgot to throw that away. Here it is!" was the answer of the sportsman, fumbling among the meshes of his bag and throwing the attenuated morsel to Rod, who laughed, went to the door and saved the owner any further trouble, as well as showed his appreciation of the sporting success, by launching it into the street. Then Charley Denniston, thus relieved, passed on up to his chamber; and Master Rod, his errand done went back to report to his principal. 
               That was a hearty supper, however incongruous, discussed by the half-famished fellow half an hour after; and that was a deadly slumber, produced by thorough exhaustion, in which he was plunged an hour still later. If he dreamed, it was of a phantom snipe, that evaded all efforts at capture, until Lettice Holloway started suddenly up in the path, caught it in her little white hand without difficulty, and handed it to him with a mocking curtsey and a laugh which seemed to ring over the entire neighborhood. 
               The dinner hour is an early one, in Seaboard County, to-day: it was still earlier at the period with which we are dealing. It was at twelve o'clock that Charley Denniston had promised to call at the office of the Squire, to dine with him at his house at one. And if nearly all the time elapsing between his awaking at nine, and the twelve at which he was "due" at the office, passed in making up a toilet more careful than any that he had before shown to the good people of Topsail, who shall blame the son of one of the wealthiest of the city merchants, going to pass muster under the eyes of a young lady who had shown, only two days previously that she had bright eyes and a very independent faculty of using them? And who could better afford to be careful of his personal appearance than the handsome and fresh-looking young man, on whose face neither age nor sorrow had as yet been allowed to set one line to mock the grace of his surroundings? 
               It was with such a pleasant tremor at his heart as he had never felt when coming into the presence of the loveliest girls of his native city, that the young man that day approached the stoop of Squire Holloway's unromantic and most utilitarian "store." He must pass through it, to reach the upper room: should he meet the tangled curls and pouting lip and merry dark eye of Lettice Holloway on that perilous passage? 
               No-whatever had chanced to that young lady, she was not there officiating in the high places of trade. The shock-headed second in command was in sole charge of the business, and an acute observer would have noticed that he seemed to be swallowing painfully, even when attending upon customers, as if he labored under the necessity of getting down a large amount of candies, raisins and other delicacies, within a limited period. 
               Having the question as to the presence of the Squire in the office above, answered in the affirmative, Denniston ascended the stair and once more approached the dispensary of justice for the Topsail district. Again, as before, he heard voices as he approached the half-closed door, though there was no laughter and no enraged old woman put him in bodily peril. He could see within, without being himself observed. Rod was seated on his stool, copying; the Squire occupied his big chair, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth, and there was some one near him whose voice could be heard though the figure was unseen. The voice, as the young man recognised at the first word, was that of the Agent Hawkins, loud, arrogant and ill-tempered. Denniston paused to listen, before causing any interruption by entering. 
               (Par parenthese, and as the young man knew afterwards-this was the state of affairs actually existing. There were but two magistrates at Topsail or in the vicinity-Squire Holloway, and a rival at some two miles distance, from the latter of whom Hawkins had procured that second warrant which secured the arrest of the Wrecker. Depending upon him, but with small faith in Squire Holloway, Hawkins had come down from Clayboro that morning, full of "threatenings and slaughter" against the men who had maltreated him at the Ditch, and determined to have them arrested without one hour's delay, so that he could finish with them and return to the city at the earliest possible moment. Alas!-when he reached the abode of the rival justice, posse comitatus at his back, he had found a vacancy where erewhile stood that proud statue of legal dignity-the Squire was gone Eastward, for a week! But one resource remained-to force the necessary warrants from Squire Holloway, however lukewarm and unwilling he might be. He had reached the office a few moments before Denniston, and told his story to the magistrate-that official not keeping a face straight enough, meanwhile, to mollify the crabbed humor of the ill-used Agent.) 
               "And now I tell you, Squire Holloway, that we have spent time enough, and that I demand warrants for the arrest of every one of those men!" Hawkins was saying, when Denniston first recognized his voice. 
               "Humph! y-a-a-s, I heard you say so before, and there is no occasion of being so loud about it," answered the Squire, slowly and nonchalantly, and giving his unlighted cigar a roll around the mouth which seemed to refresh him amazingly. 
               "Well, are you not going to issue them?" queried the Agent, his voice quite as loud and decided as before. 
               "Y-a-a-s, of course, by-and-bye! Got the names, or do you want a warrant of arrest against the whole coast?" 
               "The names?-certainly I have the names. Here they are-or where the devil are they?" and the Agent looked anxiously around for a piece of paper which he had certainly held in his possession when he entered, but of which he had not taken sufficient care, during the heat of his relation, to prevent his laying it down on the desk in readiness for use, so that Rod, who knew that it must be something of inimical character to his friends the shoremen, could quietly appropriate it, read the names, twist it up into the dimensions of a lamplighter, and poke it through a small hole in the wooden wainscot, at the bottom of which, inside, it was at that moment peacefully reposing. The legal character is too sacred for any supposition that the Squire had seen the paper, noticed what it contained, and observed the proceedings of Master Rod; though there was certainly something in the nonchalance of his asking after the "names," capable of giving rise to so painful a suspicion. 
               "Do you find them, sir?" asked the Squire, blandly. 
               "No I don't!" answered the Agent, wrathfully. 
               "In your pockets, perhaps," suggested the Squire. 
               Hawkins made another despairing plunge of his hands into his pockets, where he knew that the paper could not possibly be; then glanced at the desk and the floor, saw nothing to comfort him, and at last broke out: 
               "The paper was here a moment ago, and somebody has taken it away-perhaps destroyed it." 
               "Is that remark intended to apply to any person in this office?" asked the Squire, with a severe dignity which did him infinite credit and certainly must have cost him considerable effort. "Myself and my clerk are the only other persons here. I will lot him answer for himself. Roderick, have you seen any paper belonging to this gentleman, since he came in?" 
               "I, sir? no, sir? certainly not, sir!" answered Rod, who was so busy in copying a law-paper with great rapidity that he could not even look up from his work. 
               "That, then, sir, narrows the charge down to me, if you intend to make it. I am not much in the habit of being insulted in my own office, with the charge of stealing papers, but-" 
               "Oh, d-n it, I didn't mean to charge you with stealing any papers!" half apologized and half raved Hawkins, who was not quite crazy enough to place himself in that position. 
               "The explanation is satisfactory," said the Squire, blandly. "If the paper that you allege you had, is gone-" 
               "Allege that I had?-d-n it, I tell you, sir, that I did have a memorandum, with the names of every one of those scoundrels, that it had taken me a day to collect." 
               "The paper that you had, then," corrected the Squire. "Though really, Mr. Hawkins, I must request you to discontinue the use of profane language in this office, not alone out of respect to the supposed dignity of my position, which may or may not be conceded, but because I owe the parents of that young man, my clerk-" and he nodded in the direction of Rod," some account of the mode in which his morals are cared for while he is in my employ." 
                
               It has already been demonstrated that Rod's risibles were not under the most vigilant command; and the last exordium of the Squire was certainly not of a character to keep his humor within bounds. He began to snicker, then coughed to disguise the sound, and at last broke out into a snort which could not be mistaken for any other human emotion. 
               Hawkins had before been suspicious: now he became confident. That young wretch was not likely to be moved to laughter without some cause connected with the conversation and his errand; he was being laughed at, mocked and outraged! 
               "What the devil does all this mean?" he asked, savagely. 
               "The young man's laughing?" asked the Squire. "Oh, that is hysterical, I assure you-a family, affliction, perhaps brought on in the present instance by agitation of mind at your improper words and my anxiety on account of him." 
               This was a little too much-too transparent for any man not much more obtuse than the suspicious Hawkins. He was fiery red in an instant. 
               "Do you mean to issue the processes, or do you not, Squire Holloway?" he asked, in a tone between thunder and growl. 
               "The processes?-yes-give me the names," answered the Squire, as blandly as ever. 
               "The names?-d-n the names! I don't believe, justice of the peace as you call yourself, that you wish to aid the course of justice in this matter-that you are anything else than an accomplice with those infernal beach-pirates, ready to shelter them in any of their villainy." 
               "And I don't believe," returned the Squire, in a tone that had not a bit of badinage in it, "that there has been any villainy, or that you want any warrant, except a warrant to play off some of your town insolence upon country people, or that you know the first thing of what you are talking about. And now, sir, if you have let out the most of your bad temper, unless you have some other business that you have not named, the sooner, you leave this office, the better!" 
               He seemed in earnest-Hawkins believed, with good reason, that he was so. 
               "Oh, don't, alarm yourself!" he answered, fiercely. "You needn't be afraid of any man's staying in this cursed hole any longer than is necessary; and as for any further business with you-I'd do it with the devil first!" 
               "Very likely! Every one to his taste!" said the Squire, drily. "If you will go, good morning." 
               Hawkins clapped his hat on his head and flung out of the room, without waiting to return the polite salutation. No doubt that at the moment he did set down all the people of Topsail and the adjacent country as thieves and the accomplices of thieves; and he certainly had some reason for his ill-opinion, for his three days on the coast had been anything but rose-colored in adventure or amiable in treatment. 
               As he dashed out of the door he ran full against Charley Denniston, who had not calculated upon so sudden a departure and stood too nearly in his track. It really seemed that he could not approach the Squire's office without first becoming an involuntary listener and then falling into a collision with male or female in a state of upset equanimity-the more strange, as the Squire himself was always alternately so placid and so merry. 
               "What are you doing here?" was the Agent's rough salutation as he recognized the son of his President. 
               "I? oh, I have to see Squire Holloway on a little business," answered the young man, with some hesitation and the least shade of a blush. 
               "Humph! you have, eh? And what business is it, I should like to know? Mixing yourself up, young man, with any of the intrigues of these thieves and vagabonds?" he added, with a sudden recollection that Denniston had taken the part of the Wrecker in the first arrest at the cottage. 
               "Mr. Hawkins, I do not know what right you have to speak to me in this manner, and I will not permit it!" spoke the person so sharply interrogated. 
               "You won't eh? And who is to hinder me, I should like to know!" 
               "I will hinder you, if my father and the other members of the Board of Underwriters have not respect enough for themselves to employ a gentleman to transact their business!" was the response, given with flushed cheek and flashing eye. How rapidly the mere boy, within the past two or three days, thrown out of a quiet and hum-drum existence and plunged into the midst of excitement of mind and body (ay, and of heart!) was becoming the self-reliant man, ready to fight the battle of life as it should be fought, against all comers! 
               "Young man, you came down here under my charge, and at my orders; now I order you to pack up your traps at once and return to the city, without another word of insolence!" stormed Hawkins. 
               "And I order you to attend to your own business, and keep your impertinence for some of your underlings-not for me!" was the reply. 
               "I will report your conduct to your father, if you are not back in the city before I reach there!" threatened the Agent. 
               "And I will make any employment in the Board of Underwriters too warm for you, if you dare open your mouth to my father of anything I do or say?" was the equally threatening rejoinder. 
                
               "Stand out of my way, boy!-before I forget that you are your father's son, and settle with you on the spot!" was the furious conclusion of Hawkins, as he brushed by and strode across the wide chamber and down the stairs, no doubt on his way to look once more for those lost "names" and a more manageable justice. 
               And "Touch me if you dare-you unmannerly brute!" was the Parthian arrow aimed at him by the young man, as he went by. 
               A quarrel about nothing, certainly; and yet by no means a quarrel for nothing. At any other time than when he knew that he had been overheard in a bluster of violence, the Agent would have chopped off his own right hand sooner than spoken insultingly to the handsome and popular son of his principal employer. And had not the arrogant attempt to lecture and dictate to him as a boy, been made in the presence of the father of Lettice Holloway, it is very doubtful whether the usually mild and gentlemanly Charley Denniston would thus have hurled back insult and defiance in the face of a man so much older than himself, and one whom he had always been taught and accustomed to respect. Ah, there is more in time and place than in any mere word that can be uttered; and old Arnold of Thorndean was right when he wrote, nearly two centuries ago: "Many times, bethink you, it is less the heart of the maiden that yieldeth to the fervor of the lover who is leaving her no soul against the judgment, than the influence of the moon, that looketh tenderly down the while, and the leaves that do seem to be lisping the whispers of angels; and the right hand oft staineth itself with the red drops of murder, not so much because there is a dire enmity that may not be sated but with the life, as that there are evil opportunities, or most lamentable surroundings, or eyes looking on, before which it seemeth cowardice to be other than violent and evil." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               A DINNER AT SQUIRE HOLLOWAY'S. 
               "I am glad to see that you have got in safe," laughed the Squire, as the young man, after the exit of Hawkins, passed into the little office, through the door of which he had seen both the legal dignitary and Rod, surprised but amused spectators of the encounter without. "Glad to see, too, that you are punctual in keeping your engagements. But what do you feed that man upon, up in the city, that makes him so ferocious?-broad-axes and nail-gimlets? Why he would have all the shoremen along the coast in dungeons, and feed them on mouldy bread and rain-water, on the charge of tampering with a quill tooth-pick, if he could have his way!" 
               "Oh, Hawkins is not always so bad a fellow as he seems just now," answered Denniston, as he returned the Squire's cordial shake of the hand and nodded to Rod-the latter personage being yet on his stool and suffering under a broad grin which might have been the residuary legacy of his late prank. "He is always very faithful and energetic," the young man went on, "but he has the bad habit, I believe, of thinking the worst of every one accused, and he does not seem to understand the broad, hearty freedom of the people along the coast, at all." 
               "No-especially when they manifest that freedom by swabbing him through a muddy ditch!" laughed the Squire, still more merrily. "Oh, we people connected with the administration of justice cannot say anything in favor of such acts, you know; but it was too good, wasn't it! I forgot-you must naturally be on the other side of the question, and desirous of seeing at least some punishment meted out to those whom you believe to be robbers." 
               "I have no anxiety of the kind," answered Denniston. "I was born in the city, but I hope that I have liberality enough to be a citizen of the whole country instead of a little part of it; and I only wish that Hawkins would drop the whole thing and not persecute the poor fellows who were only doing what they believed to be rude justice to one who was maligning the character of their coast and its people." 
               "Those 'poor fellows,' as you call them, can take care of themselves, depend upon it, and Mr. Hawkins will have the worst of the bargain before he finishes with them, or my name is not Holloway!" said the Squire, rising as he spoke and once more taking the young New Yorker by the hand. "But you are none the less a brave, generous-hearted young man, apparently not a bit spoiled by money, fine clothes and an education; and I am almost as glad to have made your acquaintance as if I had found the son that Heaven denied me." 
               Squire Holloway was not looking closely into the young man's face as he spoke, or he would have seen, towards the close of his remark, that a hotter flush had crept up to the brow than that forced there a few minutes before by the arrogance of Hawkins. As if he had "found a son"-ahem! 
               "And now to the house and to dinner," continued the old man. "One o'clock is our dinner hour, and we never miss it unless the house is on fire or we have nothing to eat. Besides, you do not know my daughter yet; and I understand from Rod (this young scamp tells me everything) that Letty intends to surprise us with some magnificent roast fowl-probably a ten pound capon, in addition to our usual joint of beef." 
                
               The Squire smacked his lips a little in the anticipation, but the moment after fell into a different train of thought, and said, with a lower and sadder intonation in his voice; "Poor Letty!-she has no mother, now, and I have never had any other children who lived. She is daughter, son, wife, everybody to me-my right hand, in business as well as in the house, Mr. Denniston! You will excuse an old man's fondness; but we must not let her dinner spoil. Come along, and let that young scape-grace have the office all to himself for a good laugh, for he seems to be swelling like a toad in the effort to keep from venting it in your presence." 
               True pathos and absorbing paternal feeling, with recollections sad enough to make the heart bleed and the voice quiver, lying at the bottom of all that mischief and merriment which made the visible structure of the life of the good old Squire! Who, that did not know him well, would have believed that such a thing could be possible?-who, that has studied human nature long and lovingly, fails to know that the rippling fountain of laughter, and the sadder, quieter well-spring of tears, lie so near each other, habitually and in any other breast than that of a fool, that some drops from the one are continually flowing over and blending with the waters of the other? 
               Master Rod, by the way, did seem to be a little more afflicted with irrepressible laughter than was at all necessary on account of Hawkins' rage and his own exploit with the paper sent into privacy through the hole in the ceiling. The moment that the Squire and his visitor were gone, he tumbled down from his stool in a perfect succession of chuckles, interspersed with bursts and guffaws which seemed to be escaping like "bottled" steam, for the safety of the whole structure; and finally settled into a break-down in the middle of the office floor, regardless of the effect which the movement might produce in the store beneath-that performance intermingled with short shrieks of laughter and broken sentences expressive of the very highest order of personal enjoyment. 
               "Oh Jeminy!-isn't she one of the girls!" was the first intelligible sentence that he uttered. "And don't I wish that I was old enough and rich enough! But never mind that, you know!-you can just bet there'll be fun in that old house by-and bye!" 
               Whether that prognostication referred to the coming time when he should be "old enough and rich enough," and whether Letty Holloway was the object of the boyish admiration which so enthusiastically developed itself,-there was nothing in the soliloquy to indicate. Master Rod finally composed himself sufficiently to go on with his copying though there must have been occasional illegal lines in that law paper, consequent up on involuntary jerkings of the pen at the beginning of a suddenly renewed attack of choking laughter. 
               The shock-headed second-in-command was still in charge of the mercantile interest, as the Squire and his guest passed through the store on their way to the house. Pretty Lettice-the young man thought-was neglecting her usual avocation to honor her father's guest by taking especial care of the roasting of that ten pound capon; and blessings on her plump little rosy fingers that could turn to any needed branch of female employment with such readiness! She was not in the store, nor yet in view within the house, as they passed through the antique bulls-eyed door, entered a wide hall, with its Georgia-pine floor bare, but scrubbed and polished clean enough to have been used as a dining-table; then into a cozy little apartment at the left, which was evidently a favorite haunt of the owner of the mansion, though other members of the household might occasionally become "tenants on sufferance" during his absence. 
               Supplied with that somewhat rare luxury for the time and the section, a bright-hued, small figured English carpet, the little room was warmed and lighted by it and by the flickering flame of a fire of hickory wood, leaping and crackling with an evident enjoyment of being consumed in so good a cause, on a pair of polished brass andirons thrown well back into the brick fire-place, that filled one corner of the apartment. An antique, brass-bound writing-desk of dark wood on the side next the window, was flanked by a wide lounge covered with chintz, three or four chairs made comfortable by cushions in spite of their high runged backs and awkward shape; and a settee for two persons, dark in wood and dingy in the cloth that covered it, said to have come over to Plymouth Rock with Holdfast Kingsfear Holloway, in the Mayflower, more than two centuries before. In the corner opposite the fire-place stood a book case of dark mahogony, law-books and half-forgotten classics peeping through the small heavy-sashed panes of its doors-perhaps the very book-case in the back of which the patriot General David Forman made his hiding-place for days in 1777, when the Hessians and refugees hunted him so fiercely through Seaboard. And still in another and remaining corner, slowly and gravely ticked a Dutch brass-clock reaching from floor to ceiling, with carved monsters ornamenting the case, the moon and seven stars performing unexplainable evolutions at top, and a bell that when it struck the hours sounded through the whole house like the chiming of virgin silver. 
               "Here we are, and you are very welcome to the poor house of a country Squire and shopkeeper, Mr. Denniston!" said the owner, when they were within and the door closed. 
                
               "And I am very glad to be here, where you have so many means of enjoyment gathered, and where so evidently you find the true comfort of life," said the young man, bowing in reply before he took the proffered chair at a distance from the merrily-crackling hickory. 
               "Passable-yes, yes-good enough; and I am glad that you like it," answered the Squire. "Yonder through that door lies what we call the 'Parlor,' though it is not often used except when some of Letty's grand company comes down from the city or from away up-country where they are prouder than we are just here. Letty has a bit of finery there, too, that they call a 'piano,' which you shall hear her play, some time. The kitchen is over yonder on the other side of the hall, and our little dining-room in front of it, on the street. But this is the room where I find most enjoyment, and where I spend most of my leisure. And by the way-you have not yet seen my daughter. An old man's welcome is worth very little unless younger lips endorse it." 
               The Squire rose as he spoke, and opened the door leading into the hall. 
               "Perhaps Miss Holloway is busy-do not let me trespass upon her time," suggested Denniston, who, in spite of the fact that every pulse in his being was tingling with desire to see the mischievous dark eyes and the pulpy red lips once more, had an indefinable impression that the "introduction" had better take place under cover of the bustle of sitting down to dinner, so that the tacit falsehood he had told might be the less easily detected. 
               "Busy?-well, what then? She is never too busy to come when I call her." 
               He stepped out into the hall and called: "Letty! Letty!-come here!" 
               "I am busy, father!" came ringing back, through some open doors, from a room at a distance. 
               "Never mind your being 'busy': come here, I tell you!" 
               The Squire returned and resumed his place in his chair, leaving the door ajar; and the next moment there was the light tread of feet in the hall, the door swung open so gently that it seemed to have given way of itself, and Lettice Holloway stood once more before the dazzled vision of the young New Yorker. 
               It was certainly a severe test to which her father had exposed the young girl-calling her into the presence of a presumed entire stranger from the very midst of the avocations of the kitchen; and a man more thoroughly versed in the really polite usages of society than Squire Holloway would have been slow to subject her to it. But it is doubtful whether Venus Aphrodite ever looked more radiantly lovely than when she first flashed up from the sea-foam, at very short notice, the moment after Saturn had cast the limbs of the maimed Uranus into the Peloponessian; and women there are-her true children-who can be depended upon to be never en deshabille, whether they have just sprung alarmed from the pillow or been caught by the unlucky eye in the most unprepared of costumes and the most unromantic of occupations. 
               How truly beautiful and how unstudiedly graceful, spite of all the disadvantages of dress uncared-for, Lettice Holloway appeared at that moment! Charley Denniston had thought her bewitching, two days before, when waving off with such delicate consideration the addresses of a man who could not be otherwise than disgusting to her sense of propriety,-and magnificent when fired by anger at the insults of another: now she was literally ravishing-at least to him, and his opinion may have been the matter of most consequence involved. That small plaided gingham (which he remembered as if he had himself worn it all his life) had seemed singularly becoming at the store; but how could it compare with that dark gray homespun stuff, high in the throat, close fitting the rounded bust, short in the skirt, ah, those beech-sapling ankles and those saucy feet! and that bib-apron of indigo check, covering all the front of the dress that could be periled by her household avocations? Then the sleeves drawn up from the lower-arm and pinned to the shoulder, leaving exposed such a charm of plump and dimpled flesh as made the beholder wish that long sleeves might be forever tabooed by the demands of housekeeping, and those perfect mouldings of dainty nature never hidden. Then the cheek, flushed a little by the heat of the fire that was supposed to be giving the last touches of brown to the "ten pound capon," and flushed a little deeper at being subjected to critical examination in such a costume; and the lip pouting even a little more than visual at the interruption to her labor; and the dark eye beaming with merry mischief that underlay a heart of more earnest feeling, as the sunshine sometimes seems to be sleeping down at the very bottom of a lake of calm dark water; and the wealth of clustering dusky curls, just long enough removed from their morning toilette to be free without untidy disorder;-ah, Charley Denniston! Charley Denniston!-you had full warrant for that tingle of the young blood, that leaping of the heart into the mouth, that heavy beating of the pulses at the temples, that feeling that words would be sacrilege and silence the only acceptable worship. 
               "My daughter, Lettice Holloway-Mr. Charles Denniston, of New York," spoke the Squire, introducing, the moment that vision of girlish loveliness had fairly come within the door. 
               The young man had risen from his chair as she entered, and amid such a tumult of conflicting feelings that he scarcely knew wheth- er he stood upon his head or his heels, he managed to utter something about "pleasure of making Miss Holloway's acquaintance," "honored by having the privilege of visiting at so pleasant a home," etc.; and the young lady herself, commanding her face for a time with wonderful skill, had just commenced a sweeping curtsey in reply, when the good or evil genius of her nature triumphed, and she burst into a clear, ringing laugh-such a laugh as her auditor so well remembered hearing once before,-forgot the lady in the girl, ran across to the spot where he was standing, and caught both his hands in hers, shaking them warmly, while her words probably surprised the good old Squire as profoundly as an earthquake and two comets could have done by simultaneous appearance:- 
               "What's the use pretending?-How d'ye do, Mr. Denniston? I am very glad to see you-again!" 
               Minx! She accented that last word-her past accomplice in deception felt that she did, and that all chance for evasion was annihilated. 
               "Eh, what did you say, Letty? 'again'? Why, what does this mean? Have you spoken to Mr. Denniston before, then?" 
               "Yes-the truth is, Squire, that I did meet Miss Holloway, for a moment-" the young man was beginning to say, with some blind idea of helping the girl out of what he believed must be a scrape, when she interrupted him with: 
               "Oh, pshaw! you are not half telling it! Yes, father, Mr. Denniston spoke to me in the store, and I spoke to him, day before yesterday, when he first came to see you at the office." 
               "And this deception-this concealment?"-the Squire began, with a look of no pleasant wonder on his face; but he, too, was destined to be interrupted. 
               "Well,-if it can be called deception or concealment-I suppose-that is, Miss Holloway did not give me leave-" 
               "No, I should think not!" interruption on interruption. "The fact is, father that Mr. Denniston met me under rather odd circumstances, and I really thought, at first, that I should never tell you at all!" 
               "What?" and the face of the Squire was how decidedly troubled, at the idea that anything could have occurred, so serious as to need concealment like this, on the part of his only child. 
               "Stop, please, let me tell it!" the young girl went on, preventing Denniston. "I made a fool of myself, of course, as usual and I did not like to tell you. Steve Battersby came into the store, that day, just as Mr. Denniston was standing there waiting to see you,-and he used some of his swearing impudence to me and slapped Jim in the face because he was not waited on quickly enough; and I am afraid that I took the liberty of asking Mr. Denniston to put him out of doors, and that he did it!" 
               "Did it? yes, as willingly as ever I ate my dinner: just what the scoundrel deserved!" said Denniston, his tongue loosened by this direction of the conversation. 
               "Humph! and that was the reason of your not telling me that you had met-either of you?" 
               "All my reason, certainly!" answered the young man, who perhaps was not aware that at that moment he was lying most magnificently! 
               "And all mine, of course," said Miss Lettice, falsifying in only a less degree. "I was very much ashamed of it all, afterwards; but was it very wrong, father?" 
               It would scarcely have been "wrong," just then, had a murder been acknowledged instead of that girlish frolic; for the rounded arms were around the Squire's neck, and the head of glistening curls was buried on his breast as he sat, and it would have needed a very different sort of man from Squire Billy Holloway to harbor any other feeling towards her than admiration, even had he recognized that any absolute wrong had been committed-as he certainly did not. What, just then, must have been the sensations of the impressible young person who saw that caress, from which he was shut as far away as Lucifer from Paradise! 
               "Very wrong? no, you sly puss! not wrong at all!" said the proud and happy father, raising the curly head and kissing the ripe lips-whereat Charley Denniston grew if possible, yet more distracted. "The only 'wrong' there was about it, lay in your being such a couple of sheep-faces, and making me introduce you, like an old fool, when you knew each other already." 
               "I am really very glad that you approve"-again the young man began. 
               "What my daughter asked and what you did? Yes, by Jupiter! Let me see any scamp insult her, without being punished-no matter how rich and high-blooded he may be! And for you-you are a splendid fellow and I thank you for beginning your acquaintance with her so well." 
               In his earnestness the Squire had reached over and grasped Denniston by the hand, with a pressure that showed how hearty were his words; but that he had not entirely yielded the practical for the romantic was shown by his drawing from his fob the moment after, a massive silver watch not less than eighty or one hundred years of age, bull's-eyed, like the door of his house, and with the glass over the dial no larger than a sixpence, as if the maker had considered time very precious and only been willing to arrange for letting it out in exceedingly small quantities. Appealing to this, (as if the clock was to be ignored altogether) he found that the dinner hour had been going by unnoticed during this little episode, and actually shov- ed his daughter out of the room with the exordium: 
               "There, now, run away, puss, and look after the dinner. It ought to be on the table this moment!" 
               "And so it would have been, if you had let me alone to attend to it, instead of calling me away for nothing!" was the saucy and laughing reply, as the charming high-priestess tripped off to prepare for the rites of the table. 
               Only a few moments had elapsed, and the Squire and his visitor had scarcely yet begun to compare notes as between age and youth, the country and the city,-when the stout female "help" clattered in with her heavy shoes and announced: 
               "Dinner is ready, and Miss Letty says that it'll get cold if it stands long waitin'-'specially the capon." 
               "Why there should be so much stress laid on that particular capon, in the way of both hints and warnings, the Squire had no idea, though he certainly thought of the matter once or twice; nor was there any nearer explanation of the "help," grinning from ear to ear of her broad countenance, as she mentioned the attractive bird, then turning away her head and trying to look unreasonably demure as a penalty. 
               Dinners are seldom interesting, except to those who partake of the dainties they comprise or who join in the wit and merriment which sometimes follow them. And there was certainly nothing of mark to be expected, in the simple noontide meal of the country Squire, except that fair hands had taken more care than usual in its preparation, and that there was an unaccustomed guest to share in it. Squire Holloway's family, as he had said, was narrowed to himself and his daughter, and there were only themselves and the one guest to surround a table made for a much larger number, and do honor to a dining-room that would quite as well have accommodated (and did accommodate, when his field-hands and hired men were called in to their noontide meal) at least fifteen or twenty persons. 
               The good old fashion of tea at dinner had not yet been discarded, then, at least in Seaboard; and Miss Letty held the place that had once been her mother's, at one side of the snowy-clothed table, with a massive plated tea-service around her, antique as the clock and appetizing in the hint of plenty which it gave; while opposite her sat the single guest (our word for it that twenty years later he could remember how and where he sat on that occasion); and at the head of the table the Squire, a huge towel spread over his lap as a napkin, and carving knife and fork in hand to distribute the substantials provided. 
               No dinner at Delmonico's or the International at Niagara, this-with a dozen of courses distributed over two hours of weary waiting and the guest doubtful on arising whether he has dined or merely entertained the phantom of a dinner. The stout help waited; but the roast sirloin was already on table, and beside it smoked potatoes of mealy lusciousness, and half a dozen other kinds of vegetables, all fresh from field or garden; and new bread with crisp brown crust, and the puffy inside, as it was broken (not cut-out upon such vandalism, with hot bread, outside of the "fire limits!") threatening early demolition to the great plate of fragrant yellow butter that flanked it; and the milk-cup, called upon for contribution to the tea, poured pure cream blended in color of the buttercups and white clover among which the sleek healthy cattle had been pastured; and it was, in short, a country dinner of the olden time-what more can be said of it! 
               Charley Denniston would doubtless have better acquitted himself during the first sections (they could not be called "courses") of that dinner, had not pretty Lettice, her dress unchanged, but sleeves down and apron changed to white, sat opposite and occupied his eyes a little too much of the time for very rapid progress. He ate respectably, but not well or with unerring judgment: no man can feed soul and body at the same time and with the same devotion possible when taking only one description of nutriment! 
               As for Squire Holloway-the truth must be told-during the early stages of that dinner he did not do either himself or the viands full justice. Haman had his Mordecai, Lee his Washington: Squire Holloway had-that capon! The Squire had-the truth must be told once more-a peculiar fondness for roast capon, not only with turkey at Thanksgiving and Christmas, but as many times on either side of those festivals as the royal birds could be stuffed and coaxed into proper condition. Why Letty had not served the capon at the same time with the beef (do not be horrified-white-waiscoated "artists" at the Maison Dore!), thus allowing choice, or at least put it on the side-board within view, he could not imagine; and the wonder worried him a little. 
               At last, and when the sirloin had not yet received quite all the attention to which it was entitled (i.e., when neither of the male parties at the banquet had as yet quite eaten themselves into repletion,) the good Squire could endure the anxiety no longer. If he ate much more of that inferior delicacy known as beef, he would certainly have no room left for that superior delicacy known as a fat capon. He paused, laid down his knife and fork, and said to Letty whose face just then was such sweet calmness that it would have shamed a bouquet of freshly plucked blush-roses: 
               "Letty, my dear-you had something else roasted, I believe?-the-" 
               "Oh, the roast fowl? Certainly, father. Why, I ought to have brought it in sooner, before you had made almost all your dinner without it. Tut!-what a forgetful, thing I am!" 
               She rose at once, to go out into the kitchen after the dainty, while the "help," who had been standing by the side-board, for some reason also darted away, as if there was to be a race for the bringing in. 
               "Why don't you keep your seat, Letty?-Let the girl bring it in!" 
               "No-she might let it fall, heavy as it is and she so clumsy;" and away went the thoughtful young mistress herself on the momentous errand. 
               Charley Denniston had noticed a liberal display of large pewter dishes in the oaken side-board and the shelves crowning it; and more than once, through the half-opened door of the kitchen, he had caught sight of more of that useful metal in culinary piles and rows; but he could certainly have had no idea of the existence of so massive a piece of dining-plate as the moment after emerged from the kitchen door, borne in the hands and supported on the arms of Miss Lettice, and held with such a grasp as at once showed its value and the preciousness of the dish it contained. A sort of deep dish, half tureen, not less than two feet long and one and a half wide, polished to the full capacity of the metal, and closed with a rounding corner of the same material, under which a whole sirloin or a half-grown roasting-pig might almost have reposed in comfort. It seemed, with the known burthen inside, a heavy load for the bearer, who leaned back to her work with a full acknowledgment of its weight and a charming additional rose-color on her face which had no doubt been caught from the hot stove in passing. 
               The beef had not been removed, but on a part of the large table immediately in front of the Squire the young girl laboriously and carefully sat down the enormous dish, then with all gravity and decorum lifted off the heavy cover and displayed to their ravished eyes that wonderful "roast fowl"-certainly one of those triumphs of the culinary art not easy to be duplicated by any Soyer, male or female, and quite as difficult to forget by those enjoying the privilege of witnessing the magnificent production. Had the curly headed girl suddenly turned to be the Daughter of Herodias and brought in the head of a second John in that immense "charger"-had she changed sex as well as identity, become Perseus and exhibited there the Gorgon head and the blood-dripping locks of Meldusa,-no more blank surprise could possibly have fallen on either of the two male guests at table-no steadier, stonier gaze could have been fixed and riveted in the eyes of one!
                
               And what was it, then, that the diners saw-the Squire in the bliss of total and thunder-stricken ignorance, the young man in an intuitive knowledge that was a thousand times more dreadful? 
               In the middle of that capacious dish, covering perhaps four inches square of its square half-yard of extent-lay a little cluster of springs of parsley and thyme, somehow bearing a melancholy diminutive resemblance to such a bed of the broken ends of branches as the skilful hand would temporarily supply for one terribly wounded or suddenly prostrated by mortal illness. In the middle of that fragrant bed lay the roasted remains of a bird that had originally been framed some two-and-a-half inches in length, but that now seemed to be shrunk to less than two inches. Headless, its poor little clipped wings turned upward as if they had been two arms amputated at the elbow and lifted in pitiful entreaty, its knobbed legs, severed in the same manner, painfully suggestive of the stumps of a Chelsea prisoner belonging to the kingdom of Lilliputa,-what was the traditionally mournful fate of Cock Robin, who at last found burial after assassination, to this? 
               But even the worst has not been told-how shall the sensitive mind, and the yet more sensitive pen, which weeps great black drops of inky blood, find words for the remainder! Murder is generally cowardly as well as always terrible; but what is the moral guilt of the man who slays a stalwart giant, in high health and able to make energetic defence-to the mingled crime and meanness of assassinating a one-legged cripple or a feeble, tottering remnant of humanity-wasting away with consumption! Think, then, what was the state of affairs in this instance! Not enough that the atom of bird-life had been microscopic, it had been invalid as well. No one could fail to see, in that breast of which the skin merely covered the bones like a tightly drawn drum-head-in that meagre thigh, that skeleton fore-arm and that attenuated thread of neck,-that whether from hereditary disease in the family, early indiscretion, or severe and wasting labor and late hours, the poor bird, when set upon and slaughtered, had been tottering on the verge of inanition and death-Pegasus among mettled steeds-Calvin Edson of humanity-literally "the shadow of a shade." 
               Having deposited the precious morsel in its appropriate place on the table, laid the carving-knife and fork beside it and removed the cover, Lettice Holloway sat, down, her face calm, even grave, as should be the face of any one immediately after the performance of an action likely to reflect lustre on a whole future existence. 
               Squire Holloway gazed-he wondered-at last he spoke: 
               "Letty, you minx!-where is your roast fowl? What the devil does this all mean, eh?" 
                
               "My skeleton snipe, by all that is holy!" broke out Charley Denniston, who had been intently studying the anatomy of the bird, knew that there never could have been a second as poor and diminutive, and thus gave vent to "the truth that was in him." 
               "Eh, what!" said the Squire, the shadow of a great coming convulsion looming on his broad face. 
               "Yes," said Letty, demurely, with riotous mischief in her eyes but a command of face which should at once have procured her expulsion from the ranks of "blushing maidenhood"-"yes, Roderick brought it up to me last night and said that he thought you would probably like to have it for dinner to-day, as a bit of a surprise; and so I cooked it." 
               "Confound that young wretch!-I shall certainly strangle him!" muttered the victim. 
               "It is not very fat or very large, and it almost seemed to me to be a pity to kill it," apologised Letty, "but as Rod said that Mr. Denniston took a whole day to get it-" 
               That remark ended the conversation. Squire Holloway, who had gradually taken in the whole of the joke of the "roast fowl"-the "capon,"-exploded like a bottle of shaken soda-water, laughed until the room shook and the tears ran down his cheeks, and had he been at that moment engaged in eating, would certainly have become a subject for surgical assistance. Charley Denniston reddened to the roots of his hair at the idea of being thus quizzed by a young scape-grace of a clerk and the girl with whom he was more nearly in love than he had ever before been with anything that bore the stamp of womanhood,-then caught up the contagious merriment and the thought that the young girl must like him or she would never take so much trouble to torment him, and himself fell into such laughter as could only be excelled by the roaring bass of the Squire. And pretty Letty herself-while certain choking sounds came in from the kitchen, indicating that the "help" had at last begun to indulge her long-suppressed cachinnation-pretty Letty herself, for the first time aware how broad was the jest and how signal the liberty she had taken with one who was almost an entire stranger, blushed as red as any peony in the little garden behind the house, sprang up from the table and ran away, laughter rippling on her lips, but the tears of modesty and a deeper and truer womanhood welling nearer to her bright eyes than she had experience to understand or could have mustered frankness to acknowledge. 
               But let it not be supposed that this was the end of the dinner of the old Squire and his guest. No-had it been, not even the mirth could quite have compensated for the disappointment. But when, a few moments after and when Lettice Holloway had lost her blushes with her laughter, half a dozen of fat quail, roasted to a turn, flew in and alighted in the very dish so lately occupied by the unfortunate snipe-then the "Capon" was forgotten or only remembered as a faint type of better things to come. And when, still later, a big peach pie came in, its crust so crisp without and so light within that it seemed to have floated down from some culinary heaven like a great browned snow-flake; and when beside it stood a cold, yellow-cream-mantled rice pudding, into which the essential richness of all the departed summer's clover, in cream and butter and milk, the pulpiest rice from the marshes of Hindostan, the purest-grained sugar from the slave-tilled cane-fields of the sunny South, and the most fragrant of nutmegs that ever grew on the far-away shore of the Spice Islands, all seemed to have plunged and nestled and baked in loving communion, intent to shame the ambrosia of the gods and to make Jove regret that Juno never had rice in the Olympian larder,-then, be sure, the very sense of content grew full and the diners saw the blooming high-priestess of the feast surrounded by a halo that had love for its crown but mingled its base with the less spiritual mists of sated appetite! 
               Ah, Lettice Holloway!-pretty, winsome Lettice Holloway!-faint, romantic shadow of a glorious reality of the time!-in all your budding girlhood, in all your glorious womanhood, you may never have done anything better than the preparation of that dinner! For had you been fishing for hearts instead of appetites, who knows that a more enticing bait could have been discovered, than that which first provoked then satisfied the sense, blending with all the undertone, of mirth that bore no sting and of modesty so genuine that it needed not to be dragged forth and boasted every hour! 
               Was Charley Denniston madly in love when he left that table, as he had certainly been more than half in love before? And was there a fluttering under the loose boddice of the Squire's daughter, such as the young birds make among the trees when the morning sun is rising that will soon awake them to full life and song? We shall see, at a later period: rough men and sterner events crowd in upon the memory now, and youth and maiden must fall back to give them precedence. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XX. 
               THE MODEL ARREST OF BUSH INLET. 
               MR. AGENT HAWKINS has been seen in somewhat embarrassing circumstances in his pursuit of the men who had outraged the law and violated the sanctity of his person-his laboriously-obtained list given to the rats, and one more justice-of-the-peace in the County of Seaboard seeming very necessary. But enough has been observed of him, also, to indicate that he was not the man to falter either in a duty or a revenge, after only a single trial; and we may be sure that in the present instance, once foiled, he braced himself anew for the contest. 
               Various long and tedious rides and the expenditure of more money were needed, to discover again the lost names of the leading conspirators and to find a magistrate willing to issue the necessary warrants. But the money was no more spared than the labor grudged; and within three days after the abortive visit to the office of Squire Holloway, with the aid of one of the up-country constables who chanced to be a renegade native of the shore section, and with the supplying to that constable of enough successive quarters to put him in good humor and enough tumblers of hot toddy to make him reasonably communicative,-the names of the three ringleaders were again obtained, and warrants secured, under the hand of Squire Elkanah Brewer, who transacted business in the edge of the pines, southward-for the arrest of Simon Radstock, Ezekiel Robbins and Richard Decker, on the charge of resisting the course of justice in the attempted rescue of Barnard North, and of an aggravated assault on the person of Martin Hawkins, Agent of the Board of Underwriters. 
               But, the warrants thus obtained, their service was quite another matter. The constables who had taken part in the arrest of the Wrecker seemed to have formed an unfavorable idea of the coast as a field for the operations of justice; and one and all either refused to stir in the matter, except under special requisition from the Sheriff, or made so many excuses and kept so carefully out of the way when wanted, that the suspicion of their bearing some sympathy towards the accused seemed a not unnatural one. Here money came in play again, however; and after another free expenditure of that moving power by Hawkins, and the display of corresponding energy on the part of Matlock, the lawyer whom he had retained to prosecute his insulters to the full extent of the law-ten men were actually found and put into commission for the three-fold arrest. 
               Ten men-but nine of them were nobodies as compared with the leader. For foremost among them was Gaunt (otherwise William) Thompson, a constable from the pine country section lying southwest of Clayboro-a man of much experience in serving writs on civil action, and who made his boast that he had never yet been foiled in any business which he had undertaken. He derived his doubtful cognomen from his long, thin figure, with its sharp face, and head thrust forward-characteristics which certainly gave him some resemblance, in an exaggerated form, to Charley Denniston's poor attenuated snipe, before that unfortunate bird suffered sporting assassination. 
               Martin Hawkins was not the man to shrink from personal presence in any difficult affair; and he reached Topsail village on the morning following the completion of these arrangements, with his ten men and his three warrants, confident of bringing to speedy justice the reprobates who had at once damaged the majesty of the law, his own clothes, his personal comfort and his dignity. Two covered wagons contained the party; and at a little before noon they drew up before the Eagle Tavern, from which, on that very morning, Charley Denniston had taken his departure from the turbulent bustle of the fishing-hamlet to the staid quiet and repose of the great city. 
               The fishermen had landed from their morning catch, and many of them had already strolled up to the village; but it was an astonishing fact that on that particular day, of all the scores of shoremen who were always to be found at or about the village or the beach, the three particular persons for whom those warrants were issued should have been missing! Sim Radstock and Uncle Zeke Robbins, it was religiously affirmed at the tavern, had gone to North Carolina from Bush Inlet, two miles above Topsail beach, on a coasting-schooner, only that morning; while Dick Decker had heard the day before from his father, who was suddenly taken ill, and had gone into a neighboring State to visit him. The latter was not expected back within the fortnight, and might stay even longer in the event of his father's illness proving mortal; and the others might be absent, the loungers at the hotel added (with a look up at the clouds to see whether they were having a fair wind down the beach,) an indefinite period of time ranging between one and two months. 
               Hawkins raved internally, for to him it seemed probable that the bold rioters, expecting a visit from the county authorities, might really have fled in the directions indicated, waiting for the pursuit to relax and be abandoned. They would wait in that event, he mentally swore, at least half a century before the pursuit should be abandoned, for he'd be--the rest is of no consequence. Not so Gaunt Thompson, the keen and the experienced: he saw at once that the cortege had been watched and reported on its way, and that the parties most liable to arrest had merely gone into temporary retirement. To attempt to find them by any regular search, Thompson well knew would be little less than madness; but he had a talent for "strategy" which at a later day might have made him famous in the historical annals of some nation not above employing finesse in war; and he believed that something might yet be made out of the venture, by prudent management. 
               Hawkins was by this time in that state of disappointment and vexatious defeat which the gambler feels when he has lost the second thousand in the attempt to win back the vanished first-that condition of mind which stops at neither trouble nor expense in the accomplishment of a revenge; and he broke out: 
               "I will give one hundred dollars, cash down, to any man who will catch me either one of those d--d scoundrels within three days!" 
               One hundred dollars constituted, for Seaboard in those days, "a good deal of money, John!" as some local Solon Shingle from whom John Owens studied, might have remarked if called upon to pronounce an opinion. And there were no doubt some persons present, at the making of that offer, fully capable of betraying friend or father for that sum; but how could that sum be earned, within three days, against men who would not be within reach in a briefer average than four weeks? 
               "You keep still, and don't make any such ridiculous offers! I'll attend to it!" Thompson said in a low voice to Hawkins as he sat beside him on one of the front seats, and giving him a nudge with the elbow at the same moment. Then he added, for the edification of the bye-standers. "Wall, devil take it-if them fellers has gone away, you know, why they've gone, and we've nothing else to do but to go back and wait. But you can just tell 'em when they come back again, that they've got to be nabbed, for my name's Gaunt Thompson, I can go through any kind of a hole, like a weasel, and I always catch my feller when I go at it!" 
               Many of the shoremen smiled, and perhaps some of them chuckled a little, at the ease with which the constable had fallen into the trap; but of course that official was altogether oblivious. Those who do not wish to see have very bad eyesight, and the keen man just then felt the necessity of being atrociously stupid. But Hawkins saw and felt no such necessity; and he was only prevented another explosion that might have spoiled all the constable's plan, by another and sharper poke in the ribs and the muttered adjuration, 
               "Devil take it!-keep still! I know what I'm about!" 
               Hawkins, silenced if not convinced, said no more, and directly Gaunt Thompson went on: 
               "Well, turn about, drivers, and let us go back. If I can't catch these fellers to-day, I've got some other work that I can do, and I can't afford to spend time looking at tracks when there's no rabbit!" 
               So the wagon turned about and drove back up the street as if going Clayboro-ward-Hawkins sulky and displeased-Thompson cunning and triumphant. But when they were driving on at some distance and entirely beyond reach of hearing, the constable held some conversation with his employer, which had the effect of giving an entirely new aspect to the affair. 
               "Why see here," he said: "Mr. Hawkins!-by the way, did you mean what you said-that you'd give one hundred dollars, over and above regular fees, to catch one of them fellers, or the whole three of them?" 
               "Of course I did," replied Hawkins, indignantly. "You don't know me, and you don't seem to be good for anything, or you would never ask that question!" 
               "Umph!" grunted the constable-"very smart you are, and I'm a fool! Now see-that hundred dollars is mine-just as sure as you are a man that keeps his word! I'll have 'em in one day, let alone three!" 
               "What!" exclaimed the surprised Agent. 
               "Just what I said," pursued Thompson. "A pretty man, you are, to be half detective and call yourself an Agent! Why, boys could play marbles on the crown of your hat and make bonfires in your coat-tail pockets, and you wouldn't know it! I'm Gaunt Thompson, I am, and they can't humbug me in that manner!" 
               "What is it that you mean?" enquired the Agent, still testily. 
               "Why, this-you York slow-motion," chuckled the constable, his long head thrust forward and his sharp nose seeming to snuff the one hundred dollars. "If you hadn't been green enough to feed to horses, you'd have known that not one of them fellows has gone away at all-any farther than the Inlet above, maybe,-and that them cusses at the tavern is a lyin', just as the others would ha' done for them if they'd been in a tight place. No, no!-they don't catch Gaunt Thompson with such bait as that-he's smart, he is, and knows 'em like a book. Now I've flung 'em off the track and made 'em believe that we've gone back up-country, we'll just let both wagons go back, with five of the men; then the rest, you and myself, will scoot across the woods yonder, after it's dark, to the head of the Inlet, where I know a man that'd sell his own mother to make sassage-meat, if he could only get enough for her. We'll hide there, and if they haint gone away-and I'll swear they haint,-see if we don't nab 'em, and I get my hundred dollars-and I ain't going to divide that with nobody, mind!-before forty-eight hours has gone! Do you understand me, now?" 
               "Yes, I believe that I do understand you, and you certainly understand these d--d wretches better than myself," answered the Agent, in a less querulous tone of voice than he had before used since the day of his repulse at Squire Holloway's. The human hound was fast running his game to earth: why should he not feel more amiably than when he only had him at the long distance of a view halloo? Perhaps the very dog from whom the human hound derives his name has the same variations of hope and fear, discouragement and gratified blood-thirstiness, as he alternately loses scent and catches it, courses with difficulty and runs the poor victim home to death. The fate of the hunted animal may perhaps not apply very closely to that of the shoremen of Topsail-upon that point we shall presently be satisfied; but the hound instinet is inevitable in all the hunters of men, from Fouch of Otranto, chief of the blood-hound spies of the first Napoleon, to Martin Hawkins, self-elected scourge of the Atlantic coast. 
               "Well, then, that is all settled, and I'm to have the hundred dollars!" said Thompson, after his employer's extorted commendation. "Now, then, to obey my orders, every one-yourself included." 
               Both wagons were accordingly drawn up in the lee of a strip of woods a few hundreds of yards further on, in a few minutes there-after, and the arrangements for the new enterprise completed, the drivers, with five of the men and the two wagons, being sent homeward, with instructions to all parties to make as much noise as possible about the absence of the shoremen and the temporary abandonment of the attempt to secure them, with the additional information that Gaunt Thompson, out of sorts and discouraged, had gone away to the city for a few days, to solace his professional sorrows. 
               This very prettily concocted story, authentic enough to have come from the "reliable gentleman" or the "intelligent contraband" of artist Tom Nast, being put en train, the wagons with the five men labored away; and Hawkins, Thompson, and the remaining four men went into ambush among the scrubby oaks and dwarf pines stretching down towards Bush Inlet, where we have no occasion to follow them, the more especially as the black ants of the sand-hills and the brown gnats of the meadows kept them such effectual company that when they sat, wearing away the long hours, they had reason to doubt which of the two elements, earth or air, was just then the most inimical to personal comfort. Enough to say that the long-wished for dusk came at last, and that under its friendly shelter they skulked through to that hostelrie of which Thompson had made mention, half a mile from the head of the Inlet,-and that there they found both the shelter and the treachery of which they were in search,-the whiskey-dispensing Judas, who always pretended to be one of the dearest friends of the shoremen, selling them without compunction the moment that the word money was mentioned, and immediately imparting the information that neither of the three persons in request had gone away at all-that all three had been in hiding during the past day, either on shore or on board one of the coasting-vessels lying at Bush Inlet. 
               Ha! ha! here was success, already. Ha! ha!-Thompson had reckoned keenly and well, and the hundred dollars lay within full view! So the constable, offensively familiar (especially as his personal habits were rather spirituous than spiritual), averred to the Agent, with a slap on the back, which under any other circumstances would have brought him a knock-down as guerdon. 
               The constables and their employer lay quiet in their ambush during the night-if quiet can be consistent with the free use of a dirty pack of cards at division-loo, and a liberal indulgence in strichnine whiskey, for both of which commodities the locality was at that time somewhat famous. The Agent, it is true, attempted to sleep for two or three hours, but the mosquitoes and the bed-bugs jointly repulsed him from the dingy bed, by the two democratic laws of majority and first possession; and he finally submitted to the greasy cards and the whiskey-and-water, as by far the nearest endurable of two unendurable evils. 
               At length, an hour before daylight, the welcome signal for departure was given. Leaving the tavern, and as many of the vermin as would consent to be abandoned in that summary manner,-under the guidance of a small boy who at once knew the route and the persons of the men to be arrested,-they made their way before full dawn across the meadows and the remaining strips of scrubby woods lying between the head of the Inlet, where they had before been ensconced, and its deeper and broader portion, where the creek joined the flow from the sea and made a snug little inland harbor for the coasting-vessels. This was Bush Inlet proper, a collection of two or three respectable-looking houses and a dozen cabins, scarcely to be dignified by the name of village, the estuary stretching away seaward below it, and opening into the ocean some two miles above the residence of Barnard North, with a high white light-house forming a beacon by day as well as by night, on a spit of land at its southern extremety. Here lived most of those residing in the section and connected with the coasting-trade; and at the two or three tumble-down little docks lying along the side of the Inlet, or anchored off in the narrow stream, were always to be seen a small fleet of coasting-schooners and sloops, preparing for sea, waiting for hands or charter, or put in from outside stress of weather. 
               Here, before the day had fairly dawned, the party again secreted themselves, in a little store-house standing near one of the rickety docks, half filled with spare oars, small spars, fishing-nets, eel-pots, oyster-baskets, barrels and shore lumber generally-and affording an excellent view, through the loose clapboards and the ill-fitting doors, of the half-dozen vessels lying in the stream, as well as of the low groggery on the opposite bank, that there displayed its inviting sign of the "Coasters Retreat," painted with pitch on a whitewashed ground, very near the edge of the dock. 
               All was quiet until a few minutes past sunrise, at which time life and movement became evident on one or two of the schooners. Such of their crews as had been sleeping on board then came out on deck, yawned, looked up at the morning sky, noted the direction of the wind, sky-larked a little with each other, and displayed other symptoms of having wakened late, but too early for any actual employment in waiting. 
               On board the Jane, a fine schooner of one hundred and fifty tons, lying in the stream nearly opposite the store-house, more activity was noticeable than on either of the others. Six or seven men-altogether too many for her crew-showed themselves one by one from the companion-way; and after a time the boy pointed out-unparalleled luck for Hawkins and magnificent show for Thompson's one hundred dollars!-not only the tall and powerful form of Sim Radstock, but the round, active figure of Dick Decker, and the slight stoop of Uncle Zeke! There were the birds, all ready to be caged, sure enough; and while Hawkins gloated over his vengeance so near its consummation, Thompson actually began to make calculations how he should expend a sum so much beyond his wont to receive for any one operation. 
               There was a yawl lying at the little dock, and for the purposes of justice no permission to use it was considered necessary. Thompson, ever keen in details, as became an old hunter of men-observed that the boat belonging to the schooner was hanging at the davits, so that his men, unless they should take a fancy for plunging overboard and swimming to the bank, could not possibly escape before he could reach the schooner with the yawl. How his force of six could get the three men ashore, in case they did not wish to land-probably did not enter into his calculation. 
               In five minutes after all these observations had been made, Hawkins, Thompson and the other officers skulked out of the storehouse by the back door, then quickened pace as they came into view, rushed down to the dock and took possession of the yawl. In two more they were rowing off to the schooner-only a hundred of yards, but quite far enough to make two or three upsets and duckings probable. 
               Our three friends of the Ditch, after an early breakfast of fried pork, hard bread and black coffee, were enjoying a morning promenade on the deck, assisting their digestion with pipes, short enough and black enough for Irish "dhudeens,"-when the officers were seen to make their way round the corner of the store-house and down the dock to the boat. 
               "There's some fellers, and they act as if they was comin' aboard!" said one of the men belonging to the schooner, as the half dozen entered the yawl. 
               "So they are!" replied Sim Radstock. "Wonder who they are and what they want? Can't want us, of course!" 
               "Them's officers-I know the cusses like a book!" said Uncle Zeke, who was indulging in one of the short pipes and had the advantage of being able to keep a general survey of things celestial and terrestrial at the same time. "I don't know what they're after, in course; but they're ugly lookin' devils, 'specially that scap-net handle!" alluding, apparently, to the long, thin figure of Thompson. 
               "Why, by the holy-" Dick Decker began to say, but Uncle Zeke took the words, as the phrase is, out of his-mouth. 
               "Yes, Dick, I've been a seem' what you mean. That feeler in the starn-sheets is the Insurance Agent, sartin-the same one we hauled through the Ditch!" 
               "It is-as sure as the devil is a land-turtle!" corroborated Sim Radstock. 
               "Humph, well-let 'em come!" said Uncle Zeke, who at that moment found it necessary to take a celestial observation which came very near to employing both of his eyes at once. 
               "What do you mean, Uncle Zeke?-let 'em come aboard?" asked Griffin, the captain of the schooner-a rosy-faced fellow in a natty sailor-rig and a Greek cap which he had picked up, one time, in exchanging provisions for fruits with a Smyrna-man out two hundred days. It was very evident, from his motions, that Griffin and his men stood ready to "repel boarders" if such a nautical proceeding should be found necessary. But as evidently Uncle Zeke did not think the situation one to warrant such a resort to extremities. 
               "Yes, I guess so-I think we can manage'em!-come boys-both them topsail halyards is foul!" was his somewhat singular comment-singular to a landsman, at least. 
               The yawl was by this time nearly alongside the schooner, and with a word to Griffin Uncle Zeke calmly and deliberately commenced ascending the main shrouds. He was followed in this action by Decker, while Sim Radstock, who nearly weighted down both, drew his stout form up the fore-rigging at nearly the same moment. So close a watch as that kept on the schooner's deck prevented any attention being paid to the events taking place among her top-hamper, and not one of the volunteer crew of the boat saw the ascending exodus. Half a minute had not elapsed, and the yawl had scarcely touched the side of the schooner, when the three were sitting cozily on the cross-trees, chatting and smoking as uncon- cernedly as if the whole lower world was altogether an abstraction. 
               "Help them gentlemen aboard, Jim!" Captain Griffin gave order to one of his men as the boat touched the side. No one can positively say that he winked or made other suggestive motion, at the same time. The man obeyed, and "helped the gentlemen aboard" with a skill that reflected much credit on his education in the amenities of a mariner's life. Gaunt Thompson, naturally the most eager (consider that one hundred dollars!) pressed forward first, and Jem gave him his hand to assist him in the ascent, but by some unaccountable awkwardness that could scarcely have been on the part of the sailor-perhaps by a sudden lurch of the boat-the constable was thrown forward so violently that while the yawl shoved out from under his feet his toes caught on the rail of the schooner, and he fell on board, full length on the deck, his long sharp nose the first thing to strike the planks, and his general appearance, when he rose, that of a very angry man with disfigured face and knees abraded. The push given to the boat was just sufficient to shove it off from the side of the schooner at the moment when the second constable, who followed Thompson, had his foot on the gunwale. He lost his footing thereby, and fell between the boat and the schooner, up to his neck in the water of the Inlet, somewhat cooled by the winds of October, but happily catching the gunwale with his hands, the third drew him in, shivering perceptibly and uttering forcible words not set down in any dictionary. Thence he was transferred to the deck and the second successful boarding accomplished. By that time Hawkins, who had been gnashing his teeth a la human blood-hound, in the stern of the yawl, pressed forward, intent on his prey and only half aware of what had happened to his companions-laid his hand on the schooner's rail and looked upward to make sure of his footing. At that precise moment it so happened that the black cook-boy rushed up from the companion way with the slops of the breakfast in a huge pail, and threw them over the side, of course without being aware that any one was in the way (how could he have known?) and the unlucky Hawkins received the whole bucketful of coffee-grounds, greasy dish-water and refuse eatables in his upturned face and thence down his whole expanse of breast and front. There is no doubt that for the instant the Agent would have been glad to go back again to the slimy water of the Ditch, as an exchange for that insufferable compound of all that was sour, vile and villainous in liquids. He coughed, strangled and sputtered, as he scrambled over the rail to the deck; and the moment after the calm precincts of Bush Inlet became resonant with such a volley of hard, compact, solid oaths as must have made the snipe among the sedges flee to refuge under the apprehension of some impending calamity. So far as could be ascertained from words uttered under such disadvantages, the Agent d-d the whole coast, every man who lived upon it, every vessel that sailed from any port in it, every mouthful of food eaten or prepared, and every nigger who had ever come over from Africa or been spawned on the continent. 
               Either cruel accident had done its worst, or there was less spite existing against the remaining three of the pursuers, for they managed to get on board without any mischance worth recording. 
               Before Hawkins had quite disembarrassed himself of his whole load of invective, Gaunt Thompson, smothering his oaths (the duty of an official) was on his feet and taking a survey of the deck and the people upon it. Neither of the three whom he sought was to be seen. Of course the catastrophes of the boarding had been quite sufficient to distract any attention that might otherwise have been directed to the tops; and the indications were that the fugitives must either have gone under decks or jumped overboard. 
               "Well, sir-what is it you want?" asked Griffin, who had compelled his face into some approach to gravity, as became the captain of a fore-and-after on a state occasion. 
               "I am a deputy sheriff," answered Thompson, his voice thick and husky with the rage that had not been spoken, "and these men are constables. We hold warrants for the arrest of three men who were on board this schooner only a few minutes ago-Ezekiel Robbins, Simeon Radstock and Richard Decker. Where are they?" 
               "Yes, where are they?" interposed Hawkins, in a growl. "You don't know me, but you shall-the whole cursed pack of you! I am Martin Hawkins, Agent of the New York Board of Underwriters; it is on my information that those scoundrels are to be arrested, and d-n me if I don't arrest every man who attempts to hide them!-do you hear that?" 
               "Sure you see 'em here?" asked Captain Griffin, leering at Thompson and paying no attention whatever to Hawkins. 
               "Sure as death!" replied the constable, "and wherever they are they had better come out, for my name is Gaunt Thompson, I can go through any hole where a school-boy can stick himself, and I'm never fooled when I go to arrest a man!" 
               "No?" said Griffin half in question and half in surprise. "Well if you are sure that they were here only a few moments ago, they must be here yet. Let me see-Jem, did you hear anybody fall overboard?" 
               "One of the forrard deck-hands was drowned early this morning-nobody else that I know of," answered renouncing Jem, the same who had "assisted," in the ascent of the side. 
                
               "Well, if they didn't fall overboard, they must be somewhere else," continued the coasting Bunsby, taking a survey, with a sweep of his head, from taffrail to bowsprit. "Oh, that must be them, above there!" 
               Thompson followed the direction of Griffin's eyes, and so did Hawkins in a moment. There they saw the three men, very nearly in position to arrest, but not quite, as any landsman can bear witness who has tried doing any work additional to holding on, forty or fifty feet above decks! Both the persons most deeply interested were too entirely thunderstruck, for the instant, to speak. 
               "Well," said Griffin to Thompson, interrogatively-"there they are; why don't you serve your warrants? I'm not hiding them, you see!" 
               At about that period, had Hawkins, Thompson and their associates not been too much absorbed with affairs in the rigging, they might have observed the black cook-he of the slop-bucket-drop suddenly over the side of the schooner into the boat, remain a moment, and then spring up again. Shortly afterwards it would have been evident to a close observer, had such a person been present, that the boat leaked! 
               "Come down, in the name of the law," roared Thompson to the men in the tops, when he had sufficiently recovered from his astonishment to speak. 
               "Come up, if you want us!" came back the reply, in the stentorian tones of Sim Radstock. 
               "Yes, and mind you don't fall!" was the supplementary adjuration of Uncle Zeke Robbins, who must have been amazingly enjoying the scene on deck with one eye, while he gloated over the distant sunrise with the other. 
               "I tell you, Captain-if you call yourself the Captain of this schooner-you'd better get those men down and let the law take its course, or it will be the worse for you!" growled Hawkins. "I'll teach you, as I have done some other people, what it is to resist the law!" 
               "Why, Lord bless you, we're not resisting the law, any of us-at least I'm not!" blandly answered the Captain. "Why, see here-I'll help you, instead of resisting. Hello, above there!-you'd better come down! Here are some warrants to be served on you fellows-do you hear!" 
               "Ya-a-a-s, we heard before!" responded Uncle Zeke. "I told 'em to come up, ef they wanted to serve anything. We shan't go away!" 
               "Yes, let 'em bring on their potatoes, if they want 'em dug!" added Radstock, putting in an old Joe of the farmers. 
               "If you really want to serve them warrants, I think you'd better go up," said Griffin, mildly as ever. "If you ain't much used to rattlins you've got to be careful and hold on with both hands, and then there's no danger of falling." 
               "I go up there!" gasped Thompson, while Hawkins was at once too indignant and too much horrified to respond. 
               "Yes-I don't think they're a comin' down," continued Griffin. "They're busy aloft, lookin' out for a south-easter." 
               "Doing what?" roared Thompson. 
               "You needn't be in any hurry about it, howsomever," continued the captain. "The schooner belongs here, so that's she's part of the county, wherever she is; and you can take 'em any time in the next two or three days-any time before we get inside of Ocracoke." 
               "What do you mean?" was the atonished rejoinder of the constable. 
               "Only that time's up, and we're off," replied the captain. "Got some pitch to bring up from Car'lina, and goin' to be in Old Tar River in three swings of a snatch-block. Steve, how's the tide?-turned yet?" 
               "Settin' down, Cap'n-don't you see?" 
               "Yes, up with that hillock, and be lively. You'll want more pilot-bread when we get below, for these 'ere fellers-these ere gentlemen, I mean-are a goin' along-" 
               Three men were by this time jerking around the windlass with a will, and the officers began to realise what was threatened. The schooner was really heaving up anchor for a run down to North Carolina, and in five minutes more they would be carried off from business and their families, not to mention certain treatment that as "belligerents" they might possibly receive. 
               "Come, men, we will go ashore again," said Thompson to his companions, moving towards the side where they had left the boat. The constable saw the situation and realized his own helplessness, at a glance; and he was old enough in experience to receive and accept what could not be avoided-even the deprivation of one hundred dollars! Hawkins, with all his experience was much more arrogant, self-willed, and by no means so prudent. He strode up to Griffin, with a threatening gesture, at this juncture, and roared out: 
               "You carry me away to North Carolina, or anywhere else, if you dare! Take us a foot from this place, until after we have made the arrest we came to make, and if I don't make every d-d one of you smart for interfering with the execution of a legal warrant, my name is not Hawkins! I want to know if you hear that!" 
               "Ask that man to speak louder-we don't hear him-he seems to have mud in his throat," roared down Sim Radstock from the cross-trees, and making a very offensive allusion to the Ditch, which he well knew that Hawkins could not fail to understand. He met no reply, but if he could have seen the infernal rage depicted on the face of the Agent he might have thought that he was answered quite sufficiently. 
               At that juncture Captain Griffin, of the good schooner Jane, who had been singularly placid all the while, felt it incumbent upon him to say something that could not be called placid-and he said it. He stood up very squarely before the enraged Agent, with arms akimbo, while there was something jollily piratical about the bronzed bluff face under the Greek cap, and delivered himself as follows:- 
               "See here-I don't know much about you, except what you say about yourself; and I don't want to know much more, I'm captain of this schooner, and generally know my own business. I don't want to 'interfere" with the execution of a legal warrant, as you call it: there's the men up at the mast heads-if you want 'em, go and take 'em-I don't hinder you. But if you go to using any more of your threats here, or think that you can keep my schooner lying still when I want her to go about her business, for the sake of letting you stand here and look up the rigging all day, you'll find yourself very much mistaken, even if you don't come out with a wet jacket and some water inside, Mr. Hawkins, and be d-d to you!" 
               Even the Agent by this time began to see the untenability of his position. He ground his teeth with rage but said no more, following Thompson and his companions to the side, where the constable had just paused to hurl at the men aloft the pleasant notification:- 
               "Never mind, my fine fellows:-we'll catch you when you come back-every mother's son of you!" 
               "Bet you will!" encouragingly assented Uncle Zeke, from his vantage-ground aloft. 
               "Why the boat is half full of water!" exclaimed one of the constables, who had been about to lower himself down into it. So it was: the small black rascal of a cook had merely pulled out the plug from the bottom when he went over the side of the schooner a little while before-that was all. 
               "So there is water in her!" endorsed Griffin, taking a glance over the side, and very much surprised. "You'd better stay aboard and take a run down with us. But if you must go ashore, I guess the yawl will carry you, the little distance you have to go." 
               Whether she would or not, the experiment needed to be tried, if a longer voyage was not to be endured, for the anchor came home and the Jane began to move slowly down the Inlet with the tide. Hawkins, Thompson and their followers, making this discovery, plunged over the side into the boat as rapidly as if the water already did not reach her thwarts. Half-leg deep and very chilly as well as very mortifying; but there was no alternative. With hard pulling and poling, and swearing harder than either, they succeeded in getting her to the dock and making their landing before she sunk-standing on that now-welcome refuge to see the Jane gliding down the Inlet, her main peak and the head of her jib going up to give her steerage-way, and the three fugitives leisurely descending from the tops, where they seemed to have terminated their watch and found their south-easter. 
               Gaunt Thompson and the other constables were back at Clayboro before night. How the story of their adventure, and especially of the "hundred dollar" incentive, reached that place before them, it is difficult to say; but it seemed to have done so, and Gaunt Thompson was missing from public observation for a month. Hawkins shook off the muddy water from his boots if not the dust from his feet, against a line of coast which had certainly used him very inhospitably,-and left for the city the next morning. He had either given up his revenge as too costly in the way of personal comfort, or determined to concentrate it on the ruin of the one victim whom he had succeeded in arresting. 
               The good schooner Jane, Griffin commanding, dropped down the Inlet about a mile, then came back again to her old anchorage with the flood-tide, making the shortest "trip to Car'lina" upon record. 
               It may as well be said, here, that no further attempt was made, then or afterwards, to arrest either Radstock, Robbins or Decker. Perhaps that result was partially due to the success of the effort just recorded, and partially to the events fast gathering in the fortunes of Barnard North, so impressive and startling as to dwarf all others connected with the coast-line of Seaboard. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               THE MURDER IN COURT. 
               THE November term of the Oyer and Terminer for the County of Seaboard was to witness the trial of Barnard North for the crime of beach-piracy. The case had naturally excited much attention, at home and abroad, coupled as it was with the sad circumstances of the loss of his son in the great storm of September; and much comment had quite as inevitably been excited. It had met much comment among the press of that and the neighboring States, and of the large cities-not so numerous, so wealthy or so influential then as now, but moved, it is to be presumed, by the same varied motives, creditable or the reverse, that to-day make it alternately a curse and a blessing. Some of the newspapers of the State in which the County of Seaboard was located, alive to the insults and injuries which had for years been heaped upon it by those of other States not similarly situated as to extended line of coast, and alive, too, to the wrong which had habitually been done the wreckers,-vented indignant comment upon the treatment shown a brave and noble man who had risked and perilled so much and through so many years for the interests of humanity,-and instanced the whole affair as another proof how habitually ill-paid were bravery and self-denial. 
               Very different, generally, were the comments made in the larger cities, when the case came under notice,-and especially in the commercial metropolis much of the trade of which swept within sight of the light-house at the mouth of Bush Inlet. For years had the presses of that city (which happily has no name) found one of their most popular topics in the vilification of the people of the neighboring states; and the exaggerated details of a shipwreck never came amiss, especially if some act of heartless neglect, cruelty or dishonesty-some "Criminal Indifference to Human Life!" "Men Left to Drown Without Aid, in the Very Sight of Hundreds!" or "Felonious Robbery of the Dead by Fiends in Human Shape!" could be made to add point and vigor to the narration. The arrest of Barnard North as a land-pirate was duly chronicled as one instance of an approach towards merited punishment, and there the good journalists naturally rested as men do who feel that they have done their whole duty. They would have taken good care not to contradict the story of his guilt, had the falsity of the whole accusation been made apparent under the sublimest guarantees of Holy Writ; for do not fifty read every word of a scandalous chronicle, where one even glances at the vindication limping lamely along after it?-were they the guardians of character of those miserable wretches who were always causing them so much trouble?-and who could expect them to falsify their own record, once made, or to take away the most telling point from a sensational narration? 
               The whole immediate neighboring country was of course alive to the importance of the trial about to take place; and a larger concourse of people had never gathered at Clayboro on the first day of any criminal term-not even in the great murder-trial of a few years before, when Hoxley was tried for slaughtering his wife and child with an axe, hacking their bodies to pieces and cooking them to atoms in a farmer's feed-kettle,-than crowded in from all quarters, on horse and on foot, in wagons, carts and carriages, on the day for which the trial of indictments was set down by the thin, brown-haired, spectacled, silent, but astute and able Presiding Judge Nichols. 
               There had been little hesitation in the finding of an indictment against the Wrecker by the Grand Jury, on the opening day of term. Public opinion-so said the newspapers-required that the atrocious and often-repeated crimes and villainies of the sea-coast should be thoroughly examined into; and the distinguished body of men composing the Grand Inquest, of whom the foreman was well known to be a shameless rake and an abandoned gambler, and many of the members better known for rapid living and fast driving than for any other special qualification,-considered the opportunity a good one for sub-serving the cause of morality and good order, and proving their own high tone and character, by making an example of a man who had never dined with them, drank with them, or even endorsed a renewal note for their benefit! 
               Only one witness in the case was brought before the grand jury by the Prosecuting Attorney for the County. This was Mr. Gilbert Davis, alleged to be one of the most respectable hotel-keepers and retail merchants on the whole line of coast-an entirely trust-worthy and estimable man, whose straight forward relation of the finding of the stolen packages in the out-house of North's cottage, and of the discovery of the silks in the possession of his family, could not possibly have left a doubt in the mind of any except the most sceptical of men. The bill of indictment was found (so asserted a leaky member of the grand jury, who generally forgot his oath of secrecy when that oblivion would make him more popular at certain questionable dinners) without dissent or hesitation. 
               It was a bright, cool, frosty day in November-that Wednesday set down by the Presiding Judge, as before mentioned, for the trial of indictments; and by consent of the prisoner and of the counsel on both sides, the case of The State vs. Barnard North, was to be the first called on the Calendar of the day. In addition to Webster, the Prosecuting Attorney, the State was represented by Green, an Ex-Attorney-General, and two or three counsel of lesser note. For the prisoner appeared an eminent counsel named Bartlett, who had filled both judicial and political positions with honor, and who has since that time borne the reputation of the republic in able hands, and died universally regretted, as a Foreign Minister,-a man of tall and erect form, genial face, brown hair rapidly changing to gray, and most persuasive oratory. He had been retained, very much to his satisfaction it was believed, as he warmly sympathized with the persecuted Wrecker,-by the funds and the influence of the shoremen, aided, there was little doubt, by those of Sheriff Parker himself, and materially increased, there was no doubt, by a small package handed in one day by Squire Billy Holloway, a part of the contents of which might have come out of his own purse, and the remainder from the free heart and gener- out hand of Charley Denniston. Mr. Bartlett's junior (there were but two defending), was a very young and boyish-looking man, named Colton, who made little figure, as yet, at the bar, but who was already known in private as remarkably able in working up a case, and as one of the most extraordinary of persons for the discovery of secreted evidence. 
               The little town of Clayboro was even more crowded and overrun on the day of trial, than it had been at the opening of term. The hotels were besieged by hordes of men and horses, and their bar-rooms filled with noisy and ever-shifting crowds, whose conversation, between the imbibation of liquors and the whiffs of strong cigars, was singularly blended of speculations on the coming event, horse-talk, reports and estimates on the crops of corn and potatoes, and a world of other incongruous topics certain to be discussed by idle tongues and listened to by unoccupied ears. The petty saloons (Lazaruses of the Dives bar-rooms) had each constantly its little crowd of customers; and a perfect barricade of oyster-wagons, beer-carts and other impromptu stands for refreshments, lined every fence in the centre of the town and even gave to the Court-house yard the appearance of having been secured against a cavalry-attack. Not all the people assembled thinking of Barnard North or caring for his fate-oh, no!-for wherever an opportunity afforded some sly farmer was negotiating a sale which it might have cost him money and trouble to make at another time and place; wherever a quiet nook offered, some shrewd politician was boring for nominations or button-holing for votes, in view of the coming December election; and whenever the constantly-moving wagons and foot-passengers left a hundred yards of clear space in the street, horse-jockeys were spinning their more or less spavined and wind-broken scions of Eclipse and Sir Henry, with a view to "swaps" which should accommodate both parties or sales which should prove the foundation of a fortune to both buyer and seller. 
               The court-room was densely packed at an early hour. It was a large square room with low ceiling and bad ventilation, occupying nearly the whole extent of the second floor of the building, with a raised space of some six feet wide and twenty long, at the upper end, closely shut in by panel-work for the judges; a lower space, but also raised, adjoining, with chairs for the jurors on either side, and the large round green-baized table for the lawyers in the centre; a small space with heavy low railing around it, used as the prisoner's-dock, adjoining the still heavier railing which separated this from the common lobby occupied by the spectators; and the seat filled by the crier of the court, with the witness stand at the immediate left, within three feet of the dock and on the right side. The witnesses, as sworn and when giving their testimony, thus stood very near to the prisoner in the dock and almost directly in front of him-a fact which it will be necessary to remember, for the better understanding of the later occurrences of that day. 
               The judges were seated-the Presiding Judge with two Associates of the county bench; and the round table nearly filled with lawyers, with a sprinkling of representatives of different newspapers within the State. Not one was present from any of the journals of the metropolis: why should any have been?-had not they already done their whole duty in the case-pronounced the man guilty and helped to make an outlaw of him for all future time?-what had they to do, now, with the trifling question of his possible innocence? The lobby was crowded to suffocation with men of every age, dress and condition, among whom those familiar with the shore section of the county would have recognized a large representation of men who followed various occupations on the coast. Hard faces-many of them; but anxious, nearly all-little accustomed to see one of their own companions placed in the position of a prosecuted criminal, and with an amount of awkward but earnest sympathy manifest in their startled looks, reflecting more of credit than it suggested of ridicule. All the peculiar friends of the Wrecker were there-be sure; regardless of threat or warrant directed against their personal safety: here the pleasant bronzed face and quiet attitude of Dick Decker; there the tall and powerful form of Sim Radstock, the head leaning on the closed fists, the lips "chewing," and the whole figure suggestive of repressed activity; and at his side Uncle Zeke Robbins, not even the solemnity of the place able to drive the quizzical draw from his mouth or prevent him from inspecting the chandelier with one eye and scanning the carpet under the lawyers' table with the other. None of Barnard North's own family were present, as Rachael North was not yet sufficiently recovered from her long and dangerous illness to warrant the exposure, and her testimony with reference to the silk had been taken by commission, and as it had not been judged politic to agitate the accused man with the sight of any of its younger members. 
               Every eye, with whatever twisting of necks, was strained towards the door of the courtroom, during the few moments which elapsed after the presiding judge had given the order to "bring in the prisoner," and before the two deputed constables returned with him. A simultaneous rising, in spite of all the proprieties, took place when at last the towering form was seen to enter the doorway and as the constables pressed forward, with a little difficulty, through the crowd, towards the prisoner's dock. 
               Barnard North was dressed in the rough but respectable clothes of his life on the coast-dark woolen lower-garments, with a heavy pea-jacket, and his narrow-brimmed tarpaulin in his hand; his heavy hair showing a little of grizzling, and no care in arrangement, his beard long and uncombed, and his massive throat open and unbound. Those who saw him more closely observed that his month of imprisonment had not paled his face, but that the eyes were heavy, sullen and threatening, and that a frown rested upon the broad forehead, for which it would have been vain to look on that open and manly brow only two months before. No one saw him glance around on the assemblage as he entered; and if his sight took in the judges, the lawyers and the whole ensemble of the upper part of the room, it must have done so as he looked straight before him, for he did not seem to move his head or change his expression. 
               The jury was empannelled, and the preliminaries of the trial proceeded, with no marked features to demand special narration. The indictment was read, with all its ridiculous mass of falsehoods and verbiage; a few words of opening were spoken by the Prosecuting Attorney; and then the witnesses were called. There would be but few for the State, and for the defence none were expected except those who might be called to bear testimony to the former irreproachable character of the accused Wrecker. 
               Hawkins, the Agent, had not returned to be present at the trial as expected, though there was no doubt that his money and additional funds contributed by the Board of Underwriters in their associated capacity, had been duly received to nerve the hands of the prosecution. But Thomas Hillyer, the supercargo, the saving of whose life had cost Barnard North so fearful a price, was present and called as the first witness. He gave, with a reluctance which all saw and many could understand, his testimony as to the identity of the silks found in the house of the Wrecker, with a portion of those which had been under his charge on board the lost ship America. A piece of the recovered silk was handed him, and it bore damning evidence. The hands of the sellers had not been ready enough for their profession: on one corner of that silk there yet remained one of the trade-marks of the French exporters, which rendered the identity certain. Two or three times, while giving the fatal evidence, the supercargo glanced at his preserver whom he was thus perforce assisting to destroy; and if true sympathy and interest were not written in those glances, who shall say that the human eye is not always a braggart and a liar? 
               The constables who had accompanied Hawkins at the time of the search deposed to the finding of those silks of which this fragment formed a part, in the house of the Wrecker and in the active possession of his wife and daughter: then Gilbert Davis was called as a witness to the finding of the broken packages which once enclosed those very silks, in the out-house of the prisoner. 
               Could Gil Davis-thus temporarily called, through the formality of law, by a full name to which he had long been a stranger-could Gil Davis have seen Colton, the young lawyer for the defence, closeted with his old associate Cain, three days before, in one of the upper rooms of the Eagle Tavern at Topsail, and again that very morning in his own office at Clayboro,-he might have stepped less confidently to the witness-stand. But we go blindly, most of us, along dark roads from which we have ourselves carefully put out the lights, and yet wonder that here we stumble over an obstruction and there plunge helplessly down a precipice at the bottom of which lie death and doom! Gil Davis, more carefully dressed than usual, stepped to the box with a jaunty swagger of gain and a satisfied leer upon his face, which may have been the last feather breaking the camel's-back of patience under wrong! 
               For the first time, as Davis took the oath, the face of Barnard North was observed to change. The cold, stony look was gone from the eyes for the moment, and he leaned hard against the front railing of the dock, as if to be as near as possible to the man whose evidence, told in advance by the leering face, was to complete his destruction. A thief and scoundrel he had known that man to be, for years; as a thief and scoundrel he had more than once exposed him: he could understand, apparently, technically true but blindly false in reality as all the other evidence might be, why the groggery-keeper should be his enemy; and there seemed to be relief in this something that he could touch and realize, in the midst of all the bewildering darkness. 
               The testimony of Davis was clear and to the point. He had been one of those who assisted in the search for the stolen goods, had seen them in the possession of Barnard North's family, and had himself discovered, in the company of some of the officers, the broken packages carefully hidden behind some oars and fish-nets in the out-house. 
               To the surprise of all, Davis was not cross-examined, the senior for the defence, Bartlett, remarking that they should probably call him on their own behalf in a few minutes, requesting the Presiding Judge to instruct the witness to remain. The court at once directed him to do so, and Gil Davis leaned against the railing which separated him from the body of the spectators, immediately in front of the crier's seat and not three feet from the prisoner. 
               With Davis the evidence for the prosecution closed, and Bartlett, again to the surprise of all when the importance of the case was considered, waived any opening for the defence before calling witnesses in that be-half. He merely said, in a loud, clear voice that no one in all the court-room failed to hear: 
               "Call William Cain!" 
               Rough-faced, sinister-eyed and ill-dressed, that habitu of Gil Davis' groggery pressed forward from the back bench where he had been sitting unobserved, and made his way to the witness-stand. But he did not come forward alone, for by the hand he held and partially dragged that poor little, weazen, frightened-eyed morsel of humanity, Nink, the underling of Gil Davis and his own companion in that stealthy watch through the window and over the drowned bodies in Barnard North's out-house, which will be so well remembered. If it could have been possible for the child to be more thin, nervous and terrified-looking, than when he was last seen harnessing Gil Davis' sedge-pony or dragged by Cain across the pond-holes of the Topsail marshes-certainly that change had been accomplished. How much of it was due to the overwork, the lost sleep and the beatings laid upon his poor little shoulders by the groggery-keeper and his virago, and how much to the frightful visions of dead men which he must have seen in the darkness and stillness of late past midnights,-it is not for blind humanity to decide. 
               Barnard North shrank momentarily back, in spite of himself, at this singular appearance, for of all the witnesses possible for his defence, any of that scoundrelly crew, habitually harboring at the groggery, must have seemed to him the least likely. Davis gave an uneasy glance around, and another at Cain, as any villain, not too well trained will do, when brought face to face with a partner-in-iniquity of whose purpose he has not been advised. There is no confidence between the brotherhood of crime, and the face of one is always a threat to the other. He could not know what evidence Cain was there to offer: what had he not to fear from treachery or want of caution? God help any of us, when our hold upon respectability, perhaps upon liberty or life, is dependent on the fealty of the habitually false! But when the eye of Davis fell upon the boy-that miserable underling whom he had kicked and cuffed and cursed-that unconsidered atom before whom he might incautiously have said and done so many things that would have been carefully hidden from his elders,-then the eye of the bold bad man blazed a moment with lurid fire, to sink the instant after, dark, sullen and full of fear, in the premonition of a falling ruin for which he had made no preparation. At that instant, wanting nothing more and only oppressed with a vague dread, he would have leaped the railing and dashed away through that dense crowd, out of the court-room and the building, had such a thing been possible. Such a thing was not possible; he might as well have flung himself against a grating of welded iron bars as that wedged, compact mass of humanity. 
               Bartlett, the senior counsel, took his seat, and Colton rose. Cain, still holding poor little Nink by the hand, had already been sworn by the clerk. The boy seemed frightened and ready to drop: the sinister eye of the man was fastened and remained full upon Davis, whose glance cowered beneath it even more than he could himself have been aware. One of those inexplicable impressions of something impending, more important than anything that has preceded, which sometimes fall upon whole assemblies, rested upon the before-swaying crowd in the court room, and the slightest sound could for the moment have been heard almost as distinctly as thunder. 
               "You have heard the evidence given in this case by Gil Davis?" Colton asked of Cain. 
               "Every word of it," was the reply. 
               "You have heard him describe certain packages found in an out-house belonging to the prisoner at the bar?" 
               "I have." 
               "You recognize those packages, as having seen them before?" 
               "I do." 
               At this moment there was a shuddering sensation in the court, which grew into sound, and the officers took a moment to quiet it. The impression was deepening. Barnard North was leaning forward, scowling under his bent brows, and the whole audience seemed to be following his unconscious example. Colton went on: 
               "Where did you see those packages before?" 
               "Under Gil Davis's arm, and in the out-house." 
               Gil Davis started up from the half-reclining position which he had before held, and hurled at Cain a glance of menace. But the sinister eye did not fall before it. 
               "When and how did you see them?" Colton questioned. 
               "On the night of the twenty-fourth of September." It seemed strange how far above his position and the record of his past life, was just now the language of this man-clear, concise and grammatical, with no taint of the slang of low life or the idiom of the sea-coast. Suddenly he paused in what apparently had been his intended answer to the whole question, turned to the Presiding Judge, and asked: 
               "Honorable Judges and gentlemen, may I tell the whole story-some of it that began long before this case?" 
               The question was a singular one, but Judge Nichols was no ordinary man and seemed to read the fact that some dark mystery was hidden-a mystery better told than kept. He nodded, and with that nod in view neither of the counsel objected to what was, at the least, extraordinary and irregular. A different course might have been pursued, could the next words have been anticipated. 
               "That man's name is not Gilbert Davis-it is Lemuel Carter." 
               "Ha!" from the lips of Davis, now ashy white. The hand of one of the constables was on his shoulder in a moment. 
               "I know him, and I wish him, as well as the Honorable Judge and the court, to know me. I am, or rather I was, William Mathews." 
               "You!" The word came like a cry blended of surprise and agony, from Davis, who thereafter uttered no sound but stood like one paralyzed, brow lowering, but face white and whole frame nerveless, while the sinister eye glared full upon him and no voice interrupted that narration so certainly beyond the ordinary routine of a court. 
               "I was a merchant, in a small way, at one of the towns on the North Carolina coast. No matter where-he knows, and so do I. Remember, Honorable Judge and gentlemen, that I am under oath, and if my word is doubted because I have been an outcast and a jail-bird-yes, an inmate, once, of a State-Prison!-I have a witness here" and he made a motion with his head towards the boy, "who has never been disgraced and must be believed. He saw what I did, six weeks ago, and can say that I speak the truth. You will not doubt him." 
               Ah! here, then, was the secret of the forcible dragging away of poor little Nink, across marsh and pond-hole, through the ghostly moonlight, to become a joint witness with himself of the nefarious transaction of Gil Davis! The broken-down man, outcast and jail-bird, had been lawyer enough to know that his own word might be doubted and thrown aside as worthless, but that the boy, miserable and uneducated as he was, would yet carry that sacred stamp of credibility-which he had so long before and so shamefully bartered away! An insignificant atom of humanity; but how much to him, that night and that day, in the one long-deferred but inevitable purpose of a life. 
               "I object to all this, as irrelevant and improper!" the Prosecuting Attorney rose to say, at this moment. 
               "And I submit that it is relevant, as affecting the character of the last witness for the prosecution!" replied Bartlett, for the defence. The Judge nodded, and with no farther immediate interruption that extraordinary relation went on: 
               "I was a trader, Honorable Judge and gentlemen. That man, who calls himself Gilbert Davis, was my clerk, Lemuel Carter. He seduced and ran away with my wife. He lives with her to-day, as his wife, though they have never been married. The blow broke me down-I became a drunkard and a miserable thing! In a drunken fight one of my eyes became partially torn out, and it grew to be the deformity you see. No one who had known me before could have known me after that. Five years ago I found Lemuel Carter on this coast, as Gilbert Davis. My wife, ruined like myself, a scold and a slattern, was living with him. I did not love her any more-no, I hated her; but the old would rankled. Worthless as she was, I could not see her his and not swear to be his ruin before he died. Ever since I have frequented that house, and neither knew me, I have worked with Gil Davis-robbed with him-ay, robbed with him. I have sat at the same table with my wife, month after month, and she did not know me. I did not take that man's life, though I could have done it fifty times-that would not have been revenge: I was waiting to disgrace him as he had disgraced me, beyond hope, in public and before men. 
               "Again I must protest against this remarkable rigmarole, that has nothing whatever to do with the case of the prisoner!" said the Prosecuting Attorney, once more rising. 
               "The witness must confine himself to facts bearing on this case," said the Judge, with some severity in his tone. 
               "Honorable Judge, I will do as I am bidden," Cain went on. "Well, on that night, the twenty-fourth of September, after the worst of the storm was over, we three-Gil Davis, as he calls himself-look at him, there, and see if he looks like denying it!-went down to the beach to steal goods." 
               "Damnation!" muttered Gil Davis, but the hand of a constable was again on his shoulder, and though writhing like a worm and at the same time chafing like a tiger, he again managed to keep silence. 
               "We went down with a wagon-Gil Davis's wagon. That night, before we started, he did what he had never yet done-struck me. He struck me, here in the face. I had hell in my heart, then, worse than ever before, but I did not kill him, though I might have done so if I had not heard her voice, taking all the man out of me. We went down to the beach, by moonlight, and picked up a wagon-load of the silks and wines from the ship, tearing off the heavy packages from the dry-goods and throwing them on the beach. When we started to go home, Gil Davis told Wolf and me, with the boy, to go back with the load, as he had an errand to do up beach. I knew it must be something worse than stealing, or he would not have gone to do it alone. I made an excuse, sent Wolf home alone with the wagon, took this boy, and followed him. Didn't I, Nink?" 
               "Oh yes, Mr. Cain, you did! you did!" corroborated the poor little fellow, before any voice could bid him to be silent. 
               "We saw him, over the sand-hills, making up the broken packages into a bundle that he put under his arm, then going over the meadow towards Barnard North's cabin." 
                
               "Well-well-go on!" interrupted Colton, no longer able to restrain the questioning lawyer within him. "You saw him go towards Barnard North's cottage with a bundle of packages?" 
               "I did." 
               "It was moonlight, was it?" 
               "Bright moonlight, then." 
               "Well, did you see anything more?" 
               "Yes, we followed him, just so far behind that he could not see us, got behind the out-house where the dead bodies from the wreck were lying, and waited for him to come up." 
               "Devil!-I will have your life for this!" hissed Davis, but it is doubtful whether many heard him, at that moment. 
               "We saw him climb into the window of the out-house, over some of the dead bodies, take in the packages, and hide them behind the oars and fishing-tackle. Didn't we, Nink?" 
               "Oh yes-oh, Mr. Cain-don't say anything more about it!-them dead men is a comin' after me now!" whined the poor little fellow, who could not have given any stronger evidence that he had indeed been present at such a scene. 
               "Then we saw him shake his fist at the house, and say: 'There, Barney North, d-n you!-that will pay you for giving me a bad name!' or something like it. Then he climbed out of the window and hurried away." 
               The excitement in the court, for some minutes before, had been absolutely threatening. Spite of the general wish to hear, the nervous systems of all had been wrought up to such a pitch that perfect quiet was impossible, and there had been some low buzz of voices blended with the uneasy shuffling of feet, which even the constables could not succeed in silencing. Gil Davis, fury in his eyes and his hands clutching with mad impotence, yet stood by the rail, though it was evident that he had the spring as well as the ferocity of the tiger in him. As the last link of the chain of his ruin and Barnard North's acquittal was forged, a loud cry-half of delight, half of execration, burst from the crowd, beyond any power of the court or its officers to quell. Judges, lawyers, spectators, all were on their feet; and there is no doubt that through the minds of many in that assemblage ran the idea of summary justice to the irredeemable wretch thus shown in all his soul's black deformity. Only a few saw and no one could ever accurately describe the awful denouement which followed immediately after. Those who recognized anything saw the giant form of Barnard North suddenly upheaved to its full height from its sitting position-saw his long arm and heavy hand upraised-heard something like a hoarse growl of madness or of that ungovernable rage which so nearly approaches it-and the next instant the iron hand came down as if it had been a sledge-hammer, full on the head of Gil Davis! He fell as if the blow had indeed been given with a sledge-hammer or a butcher's-axe-his skull crushed in upon the brain-dead! While two of the constables seized the violent hand, two others raised the prostrate form from the floor; but they raised a corpse. Not starker had lain the bodies of the drowned in Barnard North's out-house, making a horrible memory for the dwarfed, starved underling. The evil man, stained with an hundred crimes and last stained with the blackest and worst-bearing false witness and attempting to ruin a character that really knew neither spot nor blemish,-had gone with that sudden death of the angry hand and that sudden leap of the soul which accompanied it, to that great account which few can think of meeting without a shudder of dread quavering the voice of prayer! None may know, until the secrets of all hearts are revealed, what had been the working of those agonies of shame and wrong which drove the Wrecker of Topsail to madness-madness that thus far culminated in that one fatal blow. 
               Such a scene as followed the "murder in court" (as it is even yet designated in the local traditions of the place where it occurred)-the wild cry of surprise and alarm that went up from the whole assemblage as the terrible truth was communicated from one to another-the struggle of all, bench, bar and people, to get nearer to the place where the dead man lay and where above him stood his slayer, grim, erect and stern, once more frozen into stone-the cowering figure of poor little Nink, the face stamped with a new dread even worse than that which had rested there so long-the baleful sinister eye of Cain, his work of revenge so fearfully done, that glared down upon the dead man like some evil star at the moment before its setting-the faces pale with fear or actually livid with horror, but a few, sternly, wildly just, radiant with exultation at the quick punishment of a deadly wrong-the enquiries of those who knew not what they asked, the answers of those who answered nothing-the cries, the oaths, the shouts, with the pounding of the staves of the officers and their hoarse voices calling for "order in the court!" that nothing less than the death of all present could have re-established,-such a scene may well paralyze the pen and defy description. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXII. 
               A WIFE REJOINING HER HUSBAND. 
               THERE could be but one immediate sequel to the terrible scene last witnessed in the court-room at Clayboro: a sudden adjournment of the court, in the midst of confusion almost unparalleled in the history of such assemblages, and the remanding of Barnard North to his cell in the jail, more closely guarded than before, and to await his trial now, on even a more serious charge than beach-piracy or resisting the course of justice-for willful murder done by his hand, in the presence of hundreds, on the body of Gilbert Davis alias Lemuel Carter. 
               Not one of those present at the trial, and who had been witnesses of the dastardly attempt made by the groggery-keeper to blast the character of a brave and noble man by manufactured testimony of the most nefarious description-but was fully aware of the justice of the blow which had taken away his life. Perhaps there was not one but would have been glad, any future consequences to the Wrecker himself prevented, to see that summary justice then and there administered. Many there were who did not hesitate to give expression to this opinion in the matter; and there were enough in the court-room, who, had the arm of the civil authority been temporarily withdrawn, would have considered it a privilege to carry the Wrecker in triumph through the streets, as a mark of their hatred to such villainy as that which had been practised against him, and their admiration for the quick and sudden revenge of the iron hand. 
               Justice, however, had its harsh work to do; and not even the cognizance of the provocation given, could hide the fact that willful murder had been committed. Allow such homicide as this to be held justifiable, and within a week every man would be judge and executioner, every man would carry his life and the lives of others in his hand, and a perfect pandemonium of violence and bloodshed could not fail to be inaugurated. Regretfully but inevitably Presiding Judge Nichols signed with his own hand the bench-warrant committing Barnard North to take his trial at the next term of the court for the crime of murder; while the lesser and pending charge, that of beach piracy, was withdrawn by the Prosecuting Attorney, and a nolle prosequi entered, at the instance of the court, on the ground that it had been virtually disproved and that its continuance could only embarrass the progress of the coming trial for the grosser offence. 
               The body of Gil Davis was removed to Topsail on the day following, under the charge of an undertaker belonging to Clayboro; and it spoke volumes for the self-control of the shoremen in the neighborhood of his late residence, that they permitted the body of a man whom living they suspected and despised, and who had died in the very commission of one of the basest crimes known to humanity,-to come home in peace to the groggery and to the slattern virago-not a wife, as all were now well aware-who alone would be likely to grieve over him. He was even followed quietly to the grave by several of the shoremen, a day later-a grave in the hard, white sand, under a little belt of pines a few hundreds of yards westward from the place where he had lived and sinned. A single female walked behind the coffin on that occasion-a female dry-eyed, and yet apparently bowed to the very ground by sorrow and shame; and there were some who noticed that one figure not belonging to the procession was to be seen at a little distance from the grave as it was being filled up-Cain, the reprobate and abandoned, his sinister eye glaring with baleful light on the scene and on the clods which began to hide away from his sight the man whom he had so justly, so long and so impotently hated. But before the procession moved away from the grave, he was gone-whither, none knew; and whither, least of all knew the wreck of female humanity, who from that burial-place went back to that den of iniquity, to become a yet more degraded part of it, to be shunned, hated, lost away from all worthy sight, enveloped in misery as abject as her crime-friendless, except that one poor little atom of dwarfed boyhood, Nink the beaten underling, clung to his remaining tyrant and tormentor, and eventually passed away with her from the memory of men. Neither has occasion again to cross the page of this narration. 
               Barnard North was re-committed to prison from the scene of his late trial, as has been already said. No word escaped his lips while being removed from the court-room to his cell; nor was kind-hearted Sheriff Parker able to extract from him, in the preparations for his comfort which he made in a recommittal which could not be for less than two months and might be for a much longer period,-a single token of thankfulness for the kindness or even of care for his own personal comfort. He threw himself heavily upon one of the stools in his cell, when he re-entered it, rested his elbows on his knees, dropped his head between his hands, and appeared to withdraw himself from any knowledge or care for the circumstances in which he was placed, or the prison world around him. And there and thus, for the time he must be left, even as those who best knew him were obliged to see him shut away, and go back to their own avocations. 
               Some of the returning shoremen carried the intelligence of the desperate deed done in court, down to Topsail, on the same evening of its occurrence; and the kind lips of Mary Collins broke it as gently as possible to Rachael North on the morning following. Weakened and debilitated as was the suffering wife, and only so far recovered from her attack of brain-fever as to be able to totter around her room-it might have been expected that this added blow would kill her. It did not do so: on the contrary she seemed to gather beneath it, the moment it had fallen, energy which it might have been well for herself and her tried and tempted husband if she had exhibited at an earlier period in their joint misfortunes. Six weeks of separation from the wedded companion of so many years had been enough to roll back over her mind all that they had suffered and enjoyed together, and to remind her how trifling are all other losses when compared to the blow which separates husband and wife who have truly loved each other. Ah, how sad that such knowledge almost always comes too late!-that it is the last vanishing glimpse of the wings of the home-angel we see, not the glory of its plumage when it is coming towards us or nestling beside us! 
               Bitterly the wife upbraided herself, at that juncture, for the maddening words which she had addressed to her husband in the hour of their heavy grief, and the averted face which she could not but feel that she had worn towards him during the few days that had intervened between their bereavement and their separation. His fierce anger and partial madness she felt-and felt but too justly-to be in some degree her own work; and the true affection of a wife, stunned and benumbed for a time, but neither destroyed nor forgotten-prompted a resolution which may easily be anticipated by those who have studied the sex that furnished Gertrude Von Der Weyde, moistening the blackening lips of her husband dying broken on the wheel, and the wife of Lavalette accepting a dungeon and probable death in his stead. She would join her husband-share his imprisonment, now that months must elapse before he could be restored to liberty, even if he should not be severely punished for the act of fatal justice he had committed. 
               "My husband is in prison," said the just-awakening wife, when she had informed Mary Collins of her determination, and that unspiritual angel of common life would have persuaded her that she owed duty to herself and children which should debar her from such a sacrifice-"My husband is in prison and must lie there for long months. He is maddened with shame and wrong, or he would never have done the violent deed they tell. Do not attempt to persuade me against it-I will go!" 
               "And the boys?" asked Mary Collins. 
               "Barnard will be all winter with Decker, and Willie-" 
               "Willie can go with Radstock, or Uncle Zeke, or some of them. But Charlotte?" 
               "Mary Collins, you have been a good angel to me," answered the wife. "I know that if I asked you to do so, you would take Charlotte and care for her as no one else besides a mother could do." 
               "Rachael North, I would," emphatically answered the good little woman; "but I do not think it would be best, for your husband's sake, to let him feel that the cabin was shut up and that he had no longer a home for himself and his family." 
               "Perhaps you are right," said Rachael North, feebly grasping the hand of Mary Collins from the rough arm chair where she had been lying half buried in pillows and bed-clothes. "Charlotte!" and the young girl, who had up to that time been sewing in the opposite corner of the room, rose and approached her mother. Ah, Rachael North, it was a young mistress you were preparing to give the cottage, in that fragile thing of fifteen, with that delicate silken brown hair, those drooping eyes, that trembling lip, that gentle, pleasing, compliant and almost helpless expression of face, and that nervous and incapable temperament-of whom no close student of physiognomy would have failed to say: "Poor girl!"-God pity and help her if she is ever thrown into trouble or placed at the mercy of the selfish and cruel!" 
               Rachael North could not have seen all this through the eyes that had lately wept so much, even had she known the study indicated: as it was, she only saw before her a girl verging on womanhood-her only daughter, and the one upon whom she must depend, in her new resolution, to preserve the shadow of what had so lately been their happy home. 
               "Charlotte," said the mother, "I am going away-going to Clayboro to stay with your poor father." 
               In an instant the tears were in the eyes of Charlotte, and she was sobbing; and yet it must be said that she was weeping and sobbing childishly, as an infant might have done when its mother was going away for a visit, not as a woman who realized what was the stern necessity dividing the family. 
               "Do you think that you can keep the house, here, after I am gone, so that Barnard and Willie can have a place to sleep, if Mr. Decker and the rest of them will attend to your having things to eat and good Mrs. Collins will come down once in a while to look after you and help you along?" 
               "Yes, come down very often, Charlotte, if you need me!" put in the benevolent woman, who would have made the same promise to keep crossing the Atlantic, if necessary-and fulfilled it! 
               "I will try, mother-but oh, I shall be so lonesome!" answered the poor girl, who had really little thought or anxiety beyond that fact. 
               "You must be a woman, now, Charlotte, remember!" continued the mother as if the necessity made the possibility. No easy thing to do-girlhood leaping into womanhood with a bound, except through sorrow and suffering too painful to contemplate; not easier than it is for poor little ten-year-old Charley, of the other sex, to keep from shrinking away from the hobgoblins that he sees lurking behind the white grave-stones as he passes the church-yard gate in the moon-light, because the stern, strong voice of forty has bidden him: "Be a man, and forget all about such nonsense!" 
                
               And so it was arranged. Charlotte was to be housekeeper, with the help already indicated; and the boys, finding what employment they could from the kindness of the shoremen, were still to make their home at the cabin. The next day Dick Decker-well aware that late events had done away with any danger of arrest in which he might yet have stood for the violence at the Ditch,-came down the causeway with a fish-wagon laboriously washed-out and filled with the requisite quantity of board seats and clean rye-straw; and so escorted, Rachael North bade farewell to the home so suddenly desolated, and followed her husband into imprisonment. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               THOMAS HILLYER'S IMPRECATION. 
               ON the day after his re-commitment the Wrecker was visited in his cell by Thomas Hillyer, the supercargo whose life he had so dearly bought with that of his son (none knew then, how dearly!) He had reluctantly borne testimony against his benefactor on the trial; and the Wrecker, even when he seemed to see nothing, had marked the emotion with attention. We dearest love that which has cost up most dearly; and there is no bond towards another, so strong as having conferred upon that other an obligation, until the service has been repaid by too signally black an ingratitude! Perhaps no other human being could have entered Barnard North's cell, in whom he would have permitted himself to feel more interest-whose visit would, indeed, have come so near to receiving a welcome. 
               There was that in Thomas Hillyer, calculated to win upon others than the Wrecker of Topsail. He has already been described as he lay in that insensible condition in the boat, on the day of his rescue; but Barnard North had not before seen him showing to such admirable advantage as in the present visit. He saw that the slight form was well-knit and athletic; that the silky dark-brown beard and hair, gracefully worn, framed a warm eye and pleasant face; that he dressed well and with just that amount of affectation of the sailor which his several voyages as supercargo might justify, while it went far on the road to the Wrecker's heart; that his manner was easy and confident as well as confidential-that he was, in short, a fine-looking young man and an exceedingly enjoyable companion. And was he not really, to some extent, his son?-for had he not given him life again when without his aid the breath of life must have been fled beyond recall? What wonder that the heart of Barnard North warmed towards him-that no visit could have been more grateful? 
               "My best friend!-the saviour of my life!-I am sorry to see you here again!" cried the supercargo, springing forward and grasping both the large hands of the prisoner in his, as Sheriff Parker personally brought him in and then left the cell. "I hoped to see you free to-day-free, as you ought to have been!" 
               "Humph!" replied Barnard North. "Free? Am I not a beach-pirate? Didn't you hear them swear to it? Didn't they find the proofs in my shed of my being a scoundrel? What right have beach-pirates to be free?" 
               There was a bitter mockery in his words, but even more in the tone of their delivery. But Thomas Hillyer saw that this feeling was by no means directed at him or intended to pain him. He saw and marked, too, that the man seemed to be oblivious, for the time, of those terrible scenes which had occurred at the close of the trial. He scarcely knew how to recall his knowledge and was puzzling over the necessity, when a flash of recollection seemed to come over the Wrecker's face and he himself opened that fearful subject, speaking in a heavy, dull, sullen tone, but one betraying neither tremor of the nerves or sorrow for the deed: 
               "A pirate? Yes, I said it, and so did Gil Davis! Wonder if he will ever sneak into my shed again with his cussed beach-plunder, and then try to swear away the character of an honest man!" 
               "I think not!" Hillyer answered, a little horrified, in spite of himself, at this particular phase of the Wrecker's conversation. "Gil Davis is not likely to bear false witness against any one again!" 
               "Then he is dead, d-- him?" half rising from the side of his straw pallet, on which he had been sitting, and peering into the face of Hillyer with an expression which literally sent the blood curdling to his heart. "They said that he was dead, but I couldn't quite believe them. Why, the beach-pirate must have a hard hand, to kill a strong man with a mere tap like that!" and he held up his powerful hand in the dim prison light and seemed to measure the size and weight of the iron knuckles with a complacency that was little else than horrible. 
               "That hand was a firm and strong one, for my sake," said Hillyer, after thinking a moment, striving to turn away the recollection of the Wrecker from that theme, and to introduce the offer of some personal service that might lie in his power. "But for that hand I should have made a meal for the sharks, several weeks ago, and the waves might have been knocking my bones about, any where between Montauk and Hatteras!" 
               "Do you say so, young man!" exclaimed the Wrecker, a feeling of real pleasure showing itself for the moment on his face, as he stretched out the same hard hand and grasped that of the supercargo. "I am glad to hear you say so, for it cost me more than my soul was worth to do that one good deed, and I would not have you forget it!" Then the pleased light went out from his face, his head sunk between his hands, and he bowed down helplessly. 
               "When I do forget it, or forget the gratitude I owe to the man who saved my life, may the same hand that took me from the waves throw me back and drown me there!" That was a solemn imprecation and one the like of which humanity should be slow to utter; but the supercargo meant the words he spoke. Frithiof had a much more harmless purpose than the deadly sacrilege of burning the shrine of the White God when he first strode into Balder's temple; and perhaps we are nearly all Hazacls hurling indignant denial in the teeth of some prophet of shame, at one period or another of our lives! 
               "I don't believe that you ever will forget it!" was the reply of the Wrecker, this time without raising his head: "I shall not, be sure of that!" 
               "I have nothing to do, now, for days," the young man resumed, once more endeavoring to approach the errand on which he had apparently come. 
               "Cannot you tell me of something that I can do to prove that I have not forgotten or undervalued the service rendered?" 
               "Ha!" said Barnard North, his head raised again and a look of interest once more sweeping over his face. "Yes, you could do something for me. I have a wife-you remember her. They tell me that she has been very sick; and I have children yet. The boys at the shore will not dare, I suppose, to come and see me now. If you could-yes, I will ask it of you, though I did not think that I should ever ask a favor of mortal man again-if you could go down and see how they are getting on, and let me know--" 
               "I will go this very day-this very moment!" cried the supercargo, grasping his hand with a warmth that not even the frozen Wrecker could easily doubt, and an alacrity which spoke volumes for his anxiety to do good with all possible speed. "It was the very thing that I came here to propose. The shoremen will not let them want, I know; and if they would, I would not, while I had a shilling left to feed myself!" 
               A little boastful, this, but what matter? There have been braggarts who were brave men, and benevolent people who did not always take care to hide from the sinister hand what was being done by the dexter: so let the promise stand for what it was really worth, here and for eternity! 
               "God bless you!" broke from the lips that had been cold and hard for so many days. The iron hand wrung that of Hillyer painfully: the rough giant had become a child. The supercargo felt that he could speak no more, just then, and returning that grasp as well as he was able, he left the cell to fullfil his promise. But as he went out he looked back for an instant and saw that the head of the Wrecker had once more sunken beneath his hands-and that he was as silent and apparently as helpless as before. 
               That afternoon Barnard North's solitude was again disturbed, and in a manner yet more calculated to shake his equanimity. Kind old Sheriff Parker himself again unlocked the door of his cell, and said, in a voice betraying emotion altogether out of place in an official who has to do with crime and suffering:- 
               "Another visitor for you, Mr. North-a lady: one that I think you will be glad to see." 
               A tall form in black stepped that moment within the cell, and at the same time the door clanged heavily to and the Sheriff was gone. The form was that of a woman; and a black veil concealed her face, even as the black crape shrouded her figure. Such a mourning presence as the men of America were compelled to look upon, nearly every hour of busy life within those long, sad days when the best blood of the republic was soaking its soil and the gaunt shadow had clanked his bones over the door-step of nearly every household in the land. But Barnard North saw and felt through all that sad envelopment, and knew that his wife had come to visit him in prison. She spoke no word, as yet, but tottered towards him with the step and gesture of one who was very weak and suffering. The Wrecker had risen from his seat on the side of the wretched pallet, at the entrance of the Sheriff; and he, too, stood for the moment silent. Through his wrung heart and tortured brain no doubt ran the remembrance of all that had been suffered by both and between both, in the last few weeks of misfortune and shame. But however that might have been, over the mind of the husband there certainly came the memory of other and happier days, and of the step that had never before faltered beside his own during nearly twenty years of wedded life. He held out his brawny arms and opened his broad bosom to the waiting woman, with one word which told alike of love which had never been dimmed, and of sorrow which even that love could never more quite roll away. 
               "Rachael!" 
               The heart of the wife responded, and her lips gave out the same cry of love and despair as she flung her wasted and feeble form upon his broad and sinewy breast: 
               "Barnard!" 
               But even then came a revulsion, in the one if not in the other. Scarcely had his arms closed around the form dearer to him than anything else in life, when over the features of the Wrecker there crept again that dark shadow, making them like the granite or black basalt of some of the crumbling oriental monuments; and his voice grew hoarse and harsh. 
               "Why did you come here, woman?" he asked, after one moment of silence and when the arms of the wife had not yet been lifted from his neck. "This is a prison-do you not know it? What have you done, that they have brought you here?" 
               "A prison? What then? Is not my husband here?" the poor wife found words to utter. "Did you not want to see me, Barnard? are you sorry that I have come?" and she twined her arms again around his neck, and sinking with her own weakness drew him to a seat beside her on the pallet. 
               "Sorry?-no, I am glad to see you, Rachael North!" was the Wrecker's reply. "But you have no right to be here in this miserable den, while the blue waves are flashing and the free winds blowing around your old home. This is a place for robbers and murderers-for those who have red hands and death in their hearts; and sorrow and wrong have put between us a wide gulf that can never be crossed again. Go home, Rachael North!-go home!" and the voice of the speaker seemed to bear the same tone of mingled command and suffering that his wife had noted in it when he used those very words on the day of their terrible bereavement, weeks before on the beach of Topsail. 
               "Do not send me away-oh, Barnard!" was all the reply the poor wife could make, as she twined her arms still closer around the stout figure; and leaned her head, from very exhaustion, on the breast so convulsed with the very bitterness of feeling. 
               "You are sick-weak-you will die, here!" the Wrecker went on. "I tell you that this is no place for you! Besides-" and his voice sank to a fearful depth and solemnity with the words-"this is the cell of a murderer! This hand is red, they say! See!" holding up his iron right hand before his wife's shuddering gaze, as he had done only a little while previously, in the sight of the supercargo. "I cannot see the blood upon it, but they tell me it is there! They let us kill a mad dog, and think it a brave deed to prevent his biting any more; but they call it murder when we rid the world of a lying wretch whose foul tongue would poison a thousand lives!" 
               "Barnard, oh Barnard, do not talk so!-I am sick and weak, and cannot bear it!" moaned the poor wife, sliding down from her seat on the pallet beside the Wrecker and kneeling at his feet on the cold, damp floor of the cell. "You may be a murderer to others, Barnard, for I do not know the law or what they call murder: you are nothing of the kind to me, but my husband-the husband of other years-the only man I ever loved or shall ever love until I go to judgment-the father of my-my-" and here the voice of the unhappy woman quavered and she broke down at last into tears and light sobs-"my children." 
               "Rachael North," said the Wrecker, looking her steadily and even keenly in her face as she knelt and looked up to him-"why did you come here?" 
               "Do you not know, Barnard?" was the answer. "I came to share your imprisonment. I have been sick-very sick-you know that I have been sick-or I would have come before." 
               "Humph!" said the Wrecker. His face showed, by some freemasonry of expression that only his wife's quick eye could understand, that his mind was unpleasantly reverting to her unfortunate upbraidings on that day which saw their paradise first entered by misfortune. 
               "I know what you would say," she answered him in a voice low, pleading, almost wailing. "You believe that I have once forgotten the duty of a wife-that I have treated you with reproach and unkindness at a moment when you, too, were in grief, and when you needed sympathy and kind words as well as myself." 
               "Well, Rachael North-well?" said the Wrecker, enquiringly, as she hesitated a moment. 
               "-I acknowledge my error, Barnard," she went on. "I know, now, if I did not know it before, that strong manhood can be wrung by grief and injustice, quite as much as our own weak, loving natures. But oh, Barnard, remember how hard it was to lose my first-born-the beautiful boy who had lain on my breast and smiled up in my face in the first years of our married love! Think how I adored him, believe that I did not forget or cease to love you above all others, and pity and forgive me!" 
               Whatever of human feeling yet lingered in the half-frozen heart of the Wrecker, could not avoid turning its tender side towards the wife at such an appeal; but he did not make any motion, then, to clasp her or to raise her. He rose erect himself, as if by an effort, and said, looking down at the still kneeling woman: 
               "Rachael North, I have yet one question to ask you. I tell you once more that this is the cell of a murderer. My hand is red-they say so, and it must be so-but do you know how it was reddened?" 
               "I do!" was the response, and the wife rose to her feet. 
               "They have told you all?" 
               "I suppose so-yes, they have no doubt told me all." 
               "Now then," and the Wrecker once more held up his hand full before her, and gazed at her with a stern, hard, enquiring glance-"now then, do you see any blood upon it?" 
               "I?" questioned the puzzled woman. 
                
               "Do you see any blood upon it? You know that with that right hand I killed a man. You know how and why I did it. You tell me that you wish to share my imprisonment. I do not say that this narrow pallet might not be made wide enough for two, if they could lie close enough to each other, in heart as well as in body. Had I killed any man or a dozen men, in defence of my own life or in preventing crime against others, no one could say that my hand was reddened: I wish to know whether you see it reddened now! Answer me-was that blow murder, or the vengeance of God!" 
               "These are fearful words, Barnard!" the wife spoke, shuddering. 
               "Answer me, once for all!" repeated the Wrecker, "and then I shall know whether or not I have a wife. Was the blow that I struck, a crime or an act of justice? Did I right, or wrong?" 
               "Right!" answered Rachael North, in a loud, strong but convulsive tone that was almost a scream. 
               "Right! ha! ha!-who said that there was the blood of a murderer on my hand!" cried the fierce voice of the Wrecker, as he sealed the reconciliation by closing his arms once more around the yielding and now almost fainting form of his wife, and renewed, for the first time during that interview, on lips and brow, the kisses that had never before for so long a time been absent from either, since the night when he won her promise to be his, in the long-past years and on the far away coast of New England. Kiss close, husband!-cling fondly, wife!-who knows how many kisses may fall, how many embraces be exchanged, before the great black shadow descends and the lips so warm and tender grow cold and damp and senseless as the stone of yonder prison wall over which the slimy vermin creep and the drops of fetid moisture trickle? 
               Before he left Clayboro for Topsail the same afternoon, Dick Decker paid a visit to Barnard North, who, now somewhat softened by the presence of his wife, received him with that courtesy and gratitude so eminently his due. The Wrecker knew intuitively, apart from what he had been already told, how much his family must owe the generous young shoreman; and there was something of the past in his grasp, as he shook Decker's hand. 
               "I am glad to see you, Barney, but not glad to see you in this place," said Decker, warmly, as that grasp was interchanged. 
               "A good enough place for me, Dick!" answered the prisoner, on whom any allusion to the place seemed continually to jar. 
               "Don't say that, Barney North, or I shall be sorry for coming to see you at all!" replied Decker. See here-you know that the boys have stood by you always, even if you didn't quite thank 'em,-and that they will stand by you to the last! If anybody has a word to say agin you, let him come down to Topsail and say it-that's all!" 
               "Don't mind me, Dick Decker-I'm cold and hard as an icicle, now-a-days, I believe!" said the Wrecker. "Maybe she" and he pointed to Rachael North at the other end of the cell, "may do something to thaw me. I do thank you, Dick, and all the boys, for your kindness; and if ever I live to get out--" 
               "You shall get out, by the living Lord!" was Decker's inelegant but expressive oath. "You shall get out, or we'll burn-" 
               "Hush-h-h!" spoke the Wrecker, for at that moment one of the turnkeys approached the door, and the threat was not concluded. In a few moments he left the cell, promising to see the imprisoned man again at an early day, and to look after the welfare of the little family on the coast, and leaving Rachael North in a kind of honorable imprisonment within the limits of the jail, to share her husband's captivity. 
               The turnkey who let him out did not know Dick Decker as one of the heroes of the outrage on Hawkins and of the attempted arrest at Bush Inlet: had he possessed that knowledge he might better have understood the air with which the shoreman, as he was shown out of the jail-yard, examined the general aspect of the building. Was he speculating on its comforts as a place of residence for himself, in the event of a second attempt at arrest being more successful than that on board the schooner?-or had he other reasons for wishing to know the internal arrangements and the strength of the building in which Barnard North was imprisoned? Questions which can no more be answered here than Dick Decker would himself have answered them if the turnkey had followed his eyes, suspected his pre-occupied whistle, and chosen to be inquisitive. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIV. 
               VISITING THE FATHERLESS IN THEIR AFFLICTION. 
               THOMAS HILLYER, the supercargo, as before noticed, had left the cell of the Wrecker an hour or two in advance of Rachael North's entering it, and he had done so with the full intention of carrying out his promise to the imprisoned man. He was for the time entirely at leisure, having been thrown temporarily out of employment by the wreck of the America; and he was sufficiently well-to-do in the world to have no necessity of immediate occupation. With the shoremen he had that sympathy which sea-faring men, whatever their description of employment on shipboard, seldom fail to contract for even those who live in sight of blue water; and he had met rescue at the hands of one, and very great kindness from all, in the peril through which he had so lately passed. It is not strange that he should have been quite willing to satisfy at once his sense of duty and his desire of pleasure, by going down to Topsail and looking after the family of the captive Wrecker, albeit the winter storms were beginning to visit the coast and he could find none of the summer attractions of that section. 
               Was there any remembrance of the weak, simple, confiding little girl who had assisted to restore him to life when he lay on the very borders of death in the Wrecker's cottage-running through his mind, blending with his other inclinations and urging him shoreward? The most momentous events in our personal as well as national histories seem brought about by motives and accidents totally inadequate to such results; and the career of the supercargo in his connection with the family of his rescuer may be found to furnish no exception to the general rule. 
               Hillyer proceeded shoreward the same afternoon, and reached the little village of Topsail at nightfall. The bar-room of the "Eagle" was partially filled with shoremen as he entered, and it needed but a moment to discover that the great topic of conversation in the neighborhood continued to be the imprisonment and the peril of Barnard North. Several of the shoremen, who had seen the supercargo at the time of the loss of the America, and others who had met him but a few days before at the trial, recognized him at once; and when, in response to some interrogations, from the habit of making which, even the denizens of the sea-coast are not exempt, he told them that he had come down to look after the welfare of the Wrecker's family and to see what efforts were being made in his behalf,-his hand was cordially grasped by a dozen rough palms in succession, and he found himself in the midst of temptations to drink, which had they been duly honored, would within an hour have overturned a much hardler head than he could boast. Anxious enquiries were made of the supercargo as to the spirits in which he had left the imprisoned man at Clayboro; and he then for the first time learned that Rachael North had that day gone to share the fortunes of her husband. He then and there learned, too, something of the attachment of the shoremen to one another, and the feeling which they collectively bore towards all opponents and persecutors. 
               "There aint much money on the coast," said Uncle Zeke Robbins, who acted as one of the spokesmen on the occasion, contem-plating one of the knots in the board ceiling with one reflective eye and with the other selecting a favorable spot for expectoration on the sanded floor. "We don't have much at any one time, bekase you see as how we don't steal, as your city folks say that we do! If we did, we'd have more." 
               "Good for you, Uncle Zeke!" broke out several voices, from those who had very little idea what was passing, but who had an indefinite impression that Uncle Zeke must be defending the credit of the sea-shore and that a little applause was necessary. 
               "Not that I mean to speak anyways agin you," explained Uncle Zeke to the supercargo, "but that exceptin' here and there one, the whole boodle of your city people haint got conscience enough to bait a hook for mummychug! But as I was sayin', we haint got much money, and yet we don't mean that Barney North shall suffer. Jest you tell him when you go back, that some more of us would come up and see him, only that we don't think it prudent, jest now; but that the last boat 'll be sold off of Topsail beach and the last fishermen go to diggin' clams with a peck-basket and a handrake, for a livin', afore we let the lawyers hev the best of him for want of somethin' to pay the others!" 
               "That's the talk, Uncle Zeke!" said Tom Collins, husband of the good little woman whom we have seen assisting the Norths in their sorest distress. "Uncle Zeke is older than some of us, and can talk glibber, but we all mean the same." 
               "And some of us means more!" interposed Cur de Lion Sim Radstock. "Law or no law, they'd better be keerful what they do with Barney North, or some of us may have to visit 'em without our hands in our pockets! We don't like jails-we don't! They're cussed contrivances for botherin' honest men, while the rogues always manage to keep out of 'em! If there was a few less of 'em we'd be all the better off." 
               "No more don't I like 'em, Sim Radstock!" said Uncle Zeke, looking hard (at least with one eye) towards the last speaker, "but it isn't best to say everything you know! Jest tell Barney North we'll tend to him-that is all you need say." 
               "So I will," answered Hillyer, who had been temporarily overwhelmed with the flood of sea-side eloquence. "And, gentlemen, you know that I owe Barnard North something, and something to you all. You will find that I have a few dollars to help him, when the time comes. And there is nobody up at the county town who believes that the case will go very hard with him, under any circumstances." 
               "That's a good hearing!" said Tom Collins. 
               "Ya-a-a-s," said Uncle Zeke, slowly and as if in deep thought. "But meought I ask you, Mister Hillyard, what you call 'goin' very hard with him'?" 
               "Why," answered the supercargo slowly, not really having weighed the matter before "-why-they will not be likely to find him guilty of murder." 
               "Humph!" drily remarked Tom Collins. 
               "Whew-w-w!" said Uncle Zeke, with a prolonged whistle. "You mean that you don't think they'll hang him?" 
               "Yes, I mean that," replied the puzzled Hillyer. 
               "Well, I should rayther think not!" was the comment of Uncle Zeke. "But is that the only kind o' 'goin' hard' with him that you kin think of, Mister Hillyard? Do you think they'll shet him up?" 
               "Yes-shet him up for knocking' the brains out of that devil-fish that ought to have been brained long ago?" asked Sim Radstock. "Do you think so? I'd like to see 'em!" 
               "I am sure I cannot tell what the law may do, even after all that his friends can urge in his behalf, and when the provocation is fully considered," said the supercargo. "But we must hope for the best and do the best we can." 
               "Just so," answered Uncle Zeke, laconically. "And I s'pose there's some folks that think there's a good deal gained when a neck is saved from stretchin' and the whole body's stuck in a dirty prison for so many years that the man wishes it was a grave!" he went on, in a low voice. "Perhaps you don't know jest what it is for a man who has been used to have the free wind a-blowin' in his face and the bright sunshine a lookin' down on him as if he was somethin' that belonged to it and it liked him,-shut up where he can't feel the one nor see the other-used wuss than a rat or a mole, and half starved on mouldy bread and stale slops, at that! Ef you don't jest try it for a little while, and you can fancy what it must be for ten years or a lifetime. I tell you that I'd rather die at once and have no more brother about it-woudn't you, Sim?" 
               "You can bet I would!" responded that athletic giant. 
               "And ef they try that on Barney North, and pretend that it's that cussed everlastin' 'law' "Uncle Zeke went on, "you'll see sport before long, and-" 
               "Now you shet up!" warned Sim Radstock. 
               "So I will," answered Uncle Zeke, apparently aware of some reason why he should do so; and very soon the circle of shoremen broke up and most of the party left the tavern. Hillyer taking lodgings there until the following morning. 
               When the supercargo drove down to Topsail beach that morning, to pay his visit to the family of the Wrecker, when half way from the village to the shore he overtook Radstock, who had not gone fishing for the day,-walking towards the shore. There was a spare seat in the wagon, and the offer of a ride, after the country habit, was as natural as its acceptance. As a consequence, the two were together when they reached the causeway in front of the cottage; and as Hillyer sprang out and made preparations for tying his horse to one of the drying-stakes standing there, the shoreman, springing over the other side of the wagon, strode off for the beach without waiting to see any of the family. 
               "Hallo!-why do you not wait to see any of them?" asked the supercargo, in surprise, remembering the attachment which the young shoreman had always manifested to the person of Barnard North, which he had no doubt must extend to other members of his blood. 
               "Oh, I am in a hurry to look after my boat," answered Radstock, who was in no hurry whatever and would have given anything at his command for courage enough to meet the shrinking, sensitive little girl whom he saw so seldom and thought of so continually. 
               "Come back, I tell you!" again Hillyer called, and impelled by some power for which he could not himself account, the young shoreman obeyed. At that moment the door of the cottage opened, and Charlotte North came out, accompanied by that home-angel, Mary Collins. 
               The supercargo had no eyes to see the worshipping devotion at the bottom of the big manly heart within the shoreman's giant frame-such insights are not given to us all, or always. But he could see the awkwardness with which the young girl and Radstock met-the shuffling, shambling effort made by the latter before he could take the little hand that was tendered him-the struggle which it cost the man who would have dared single combat with the fiercest wave on the sea or the deadliest wild beast on the land, to utter the simple, stammering; 
               "How do, Miss Charlotte?" 
               "Why Sim, you scarcely come down to see us at all!" said Mary Collins, at this juncture. "What on airth's getting to be the matter with you?" 
               Charlotte North's eyes were on him at that moment-so were those of Thomas Hillyer. The shoreman's face became crimson to the very roots of his hair. 
               "We thought that you didn't care anything about us at all, now that father was gone away," said the young girl, with something like a weak pout on her really pretty and budding lip. 
               That accusation of all accusations, was too much for the poor fellow who-to use once more a homely expression that never grows old-loved the very ground she walked on. He colored yet more deeply, if such an accession of color was possible-tried to speak and merely uttered a jumble of words in which "Miss Collins," "Miss Charlotte" and "they knowed he'd do anything in the round world for 'em" were alone recognizable-then broke down entirely and strode away towards the beach with a muttered apology about being "in a hurry," and disappeared from view behind the sand-hill at the edge of the causeway. Disappeared from view but not beyond sight; for had all the terrors of sea and shore been at that moment behind him, Sim Radstock could not have forborne pausing to see how easily the supercargo was paying his respects to both women, how easily and with what pleasure they seemed to received them. Then he muttered, not ill-naturedly but despondently, before he strode on to the work that really awaited him: 
               "Pshaw!-I'm not good enough for that girl, and never will be! She's a lady, young as she is, and I'm nothing but a fisherman! Some of them city chaps that can talk-I can't talk a bit!-will get her one of these days, and what business have I to grumble, if they only make her happy?" 
               "What a great stuttering fool!" was the comment of Hillyer, uttered half aloud, as the shoreman blundered out his last word to Mary Collins and turned away. Ay, a fool, Thomas Hillyer. The dictum of the world and the verdict of society being taken as a test; but some day when the balance of true worth is adjusted, not far nor long this side of heaven, some of us who have readier tongues and more polished manners may stand shamed and abashed in the presence of the brighter and better residuum left by death from such rough, big-hearted, blundering men as Sim Radstock, who may never in all their lives have worn a presentable coat or spoken a word worthy of human record! 
               The reception of the supercargo by little Charlotte North was full of a gladness very pleasant to his appreciation of self, and in no wise strange when the impression made upon her during his recovery from illness is remembered. His welcome by Mary Collins (who had not yet left the cottage since the departure of the mother) was not less cordial, almost seeming to embody gratitude for some imaginary good rendered to herself. Hillyer, fulfilling the duties of his call, remained some hours at the cottage; and his quick eye took in the simple grace and artless manner of Charlotte, much more fully than it had done during his three days of invalid residence under the same roof, weeks before. The young girl, who had really little to do while Mary Collins remained as her guardian and assistant, had neither occasion or art to disguise the pleasure which she found in his society; and not an hour elapsed after the coming of the supercargo, before he found himself relating some of the most notable of his adventures by sea and land, Charlotte North a deeply interested and wondering listener (ah, those Othellos of every age!) and the pleasant face of Mary Collins, moving about at the household work left unfinished by the absent mother, expressing little less of satisfaction. 
               Two days passed before Thomas Hillyer went back to Clayboro with his messages to father and mother from the little family at the cottage; and only a few days elapsed before he returned to remain in the neighborhood for a still longer period-a favorite with the shoremen from his good humor, intelligence and appreciation of their manly qualities; and a favorite still more at the cottage, where little Charlotte was often alone by day and at night only accompanied by sleepy Barnard and William,-not only for his companionable qualities, but because he seemed to the simple children to form a link between themselves and their absent parents. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXV. 
               THE SECOND TRIAL OF THE TOPSAIL WRECKER. 
               THE winter storms had swept over the rough coasts of the County of Seaboard, driving the shoremen from their sea-side avocations, and shutting them up in their cabins to mend their nets or knit new ones, in their outhouses to fabricate boats or oars or fishing-tackle for the summer use,-or sending them out to employment in the pine woods or elsewhere in the wild country beyond, where they could find transient manual labor for the eking out of their scanty and hard-earned subsistence. The long extent of beach had been made desolate by the wearing beat of the surf-even more desolate by human foot seldom treading it, except on some day following a storm, when fragments from perishing vessels or goods thrown overboard in the fury of the gale might be expected to wash ashore. The fishing-boats had lain for weeks in a long line, bottom upward on the causeway, out of the reach of the sea, the snow whirling and drifting at times among them, but soon melting away in the salt air,-only at rare intervals one of them disturbed, as some over-hardy fisherman would tempt the cold and the winter sea for a few hours among the mammoth cod on the fishing-banks, or when the rougher duties of the wreck demanded a strong pull to save life or property. 
               The winter winds had shrieked and raved around the cabin of the Wrecker of Topsail, not altogether lonely, but with a poor little girl of sixteen as its house-keeper, and two still younger boys her occasional companions, except when Mary Collins or some other of the women of the hamlet would still brave the rough weather for the sake of looking after the welfare of those whom they felt that they held partially in charge. There had been another visitor there at times-the supercargo, who had spent a portion of the early winter in the city from which he had previously sailed, but much more of his time at Clayboro and between that county-town and the sea-shore. Twice during the three months elapsing between the November term of court which had witnessed the first trial of Barnard North, and the day in the February term which was to look upon his second,-Hillyer had brought Rachael North down to Topsail to visit her children, and back again to the place of her husband's imprisonment. 
               The winter winds had whistled and moaned through the leafless trees and around the old Court-house and jail at Clayboro; and the Wrecker had heard them as he sat gloomily alone or a little less gloomily in his wife's company, and remembered how they were sweeping over the wild sea-shore, and how they were beating at the doors and windows of the little cabin on the causeway. The presence of Rachael North had seemed, at first, to awaken the Wrecker for a little time from his coldness and torpor; but gradually the same feeling had crept back over him, and the poor wife had seen every day more and more clearly that the very foundations of his natural being were broken up-that no wrecked ship on Topsail beach, her masts gone and the mad waves straining apart bolt from plank, and plank from timber, had ever been more unlike the same vessel when she carried a cloud of snowy canvas and the lives of hardy men, than the moody, saturnine man, half a maniac and all unsettled in hope and intention, was unlike the strong, brave-hearted, generous man who had been the pride of the coast and the hope of the perishing. Not even to good old Sheriff Parker and the officers who visited him with the kindest intentions, was he always courteous; to his lawyers and the few men who came up from the coast to see him he seemed a little and only a little more communicative; and to her he was seldom unkind but generally silent, sometimes for a moment fierce, but always hopelessly sad. What he could have hoped, what feared, must always remain a mystery: not even the wife who had come to suffer by his side could force a glimpse of the tortured heart within. 
               A heavy snow-storm had raged over the whole country during the week preceding the trial. The snow-banks were yet heavy and unbroken over the fences and in the narrow lanes; and nearly a foot of trodden snow lay in the streets and covered up the frozen mud of Clayboro. Sleighs and sleds, disused for all the winter before, had been handed down from the hay-mow or dug out from the heaps of rubbish in the wagon-house; and through-out a wide district young blood was active and young lovers merry with the roguish opportunities offered by the good old-fashioned sleigh ride. 
               The air was piercingly cold on that morning which was to set the judgment of the law on the desperate deed of Barnard North; but neither drifted snow nor frosty air could hold back the crowd of curious visitors from every section of the country to the county-town on that momentous occasion. Two trials of the same man for widely-differing crimes, within three months, was certainly enough to throw the quiet rural pulse into commotion; and not even the chill of the deep-lying snow could reduce it to its usual equable beat. 
               The long main street of Clayboro, before described as it appeared when the first winds of autumn were whistling down it, was that day filled with every description of snow-vehicle ever constructed to meet the taste or the necessity of cold-weather riders-from the square old family box-sleigh with its upright back as uncomfortable as the corresponding portion of one of the old Puritan pews, which was at that time considered the height of luxury in conveyance-to the rough jumper with its runners of plank or saplings, built in two hours and with its box of unplaned boards for a body. Bells jingled and tinkled everywhere-all descriptions of bells that had sound or the idea of sound in them; from the heavy straps of round sleigh bells under which the teams of some of the wealthier people were hidden and loaded down, to the single open bell which might once have done duty on some bell-wether of the flock, and now tinkled at the ear of a steady-going old horse, or even the cow bell pressed into service and booming at the neck of the same reliable animal. The day of sleigh-robes was yet to come, and their places were at this time supplied by heavy blankets and counterpanes which swung from the backs of the sleighs or were wrapped around the feet of the riders. 
               All the noise, bustle and confusion of the previous gathering were repeated in the town, but now in an exaggerated proportion. The bar-rooms were more closely besieged than ever; and from the doors as they opened for an instant to admit or exclude a visitor, would rush out streams of air steaming from the hot stoves, the breaths of the densely packed occupants, and the fumes of liquors and tobacco. The sharp winter weather had prevented the gathering of temporary booths and sutler-wagons in the streets and along the lines of sheltering fences; but the visiting public were by no means debarred of their luxuries thereby, for the fact enured to the additional patronage of the low oyster-saloons and groggeries, and the enriching of the bar-tills of the "Washington," the "Clayboro" and the "Seaboard." 
               Within the Court-house, too, the aspect of affairs was an exaggerated duplicate of that presented on the former occasion. The bill of indictment had of course been found without hesitation on the opening day of term; and long before the time when the old bell which had once rung a welcome to the Father of his Country as he marched in from the hard-won battle of Seaboard-Plains in 1778, tolled out the hour for assembling to that most remarkable trial, the court-room was densely packed and wedged with a mass of human beings through whom the judges, the lawyers and officers of the court found extreme difficulty in forcing themselves. 
               At the opening of the court, Presiding Judge Nichols again occupied the bench, assisted by several of the local judges, and the same bar which had appeared at the former trial were again to be found in their places at the round table, though augmented now by the presence of well-known counsel from other counties and even from neighboring States, so wide-spread had become the knowledge of the "murder in court," and so pervading the excitement which could not fail to attend its judicial investigation. 
               Bartlett, the senior counsel for the defence, as before-sat at the round table as the case was called, with his head between his hands-his face pale and anxious and his lip contracted as if with bodily suffering. There was ever that peculiarity in this well-known criminal lawyer, that he seemed to bear the actual burthens of his clients; and a close observer might very often detect upon his face a pretty conclusive index as to the position of the case in which he was for the time interested. There were those then present who saw on his expressive features serious doubts as to the fate of his client, and a real anxiety for his welfare which the unworthy rarely had power to excite. All that man could do for the protection of any one accused, was sure to be done by Walter Bartlett, who was naturally a defensive lawyer as some have been legal blood-hounds always thirsting for conviction; but there are cases-and no man better knew the fact-in which evidence is the master of effort and eye-sight overbalances the subtlest reasoning. Barnard North had wilfully slain a man, in the presence of hundreds and under the very shadow of the awful figure of Justice: however terrible the provocation known to have existed, how could human ingenuity explain away the deed of homicide? 
               Once more the Wrecker was brought into Court by the officers and edged with difficulty through the dense crowd to the prisoner's dock. This time he was not alone. Rachael North, in deep black and with a face on which sorrow and anxiety seemed within the last few weeks to have wrought the ravages of years, was at his side, her heavy veil partially raised from the moment of entering. The Wrecker himself, too, showed the traces of his imprisonment and of that comparative squalor which even D'Orsay or Brummel would have contracted in three months of criminal confinement. His hair was longer, perhaps a shade grayer-his beard wilder and less carefully kept; and the air of the prison cell, imperceptible before, seemed to hang around his heavy suit of frayed and faded blue. Those who looked closely saw that his face was thinner and bleached from its ruddy health of complexion, and that his eyes looked wildly out from beneath their overhanging brows. Rachael North dropped heavily into the chair offered her beside the dock, and the Wrecker took his stand within it, his large hands gripped firmly upon the massive railing. 
               There had been some sensation in the court as the prisoner entered; but it passed away, and there was almost breathless silence as the jury was empannelled and the indictment read. Less time consumed in the former operation, then, than could possibly be occupied now in the same effort; for so many doubts and quibbles had not yet arisen in the public mind as to the sanity of any man who committed a criminal deed or the propriety of any punishment whatever if a certain measure could not be secured,-and not yet had that meritorious system obtained, by which every man who has intelligence enough to read or judge of the merits of any case, is carefully excluded from the jury box in favor of those who have duly hugged their own blissful ignorance! At the conclusion of the reading of the indictment some murmurs were heard from the crowd in the lobby, among whom were well known to be a large proportion of shoremen from the whole line of coast; and a single voice spoke aloud the words "A lie!" when the formal accusation of murder in half a dozen possible and impossible forms was completed. But the disorderly person was not discovered; and under the quick rising of Judge Nichols from his seat and the sharp ring of the crier's voice with "Silence in the court!" order was at once restored. 
               "Barnard North, you have heard the indictment: how say you-guilty or not guilty?" came deliberately and impressively from the lips of the Clerk-words that each has reason to pray, even before aspirations after health and prosperity, may never be addressed by the stern voice of authority to him or his! There was a general movement of anxiety and some motion indicative of rising, as every one seemed to be leaning forward to catch the response, the nature of which, however, could not be doubtful. Rachael North was seen to lean heavily forward against the railing of the dock, and there was a motion of head and body as if she was sobbing with uncontrollable emotion. 
               "Guilty!" was the answer that came, after a single moment of pause, from the bearded lips of the man who might have been the Viking of the Vikings,-in a deep, harsh, grating voice, as if hate, rage and despair were all concentrated together and hurled out upon mankind in the single word! 
               "Guilty?-you do not mean that!" spoke Bartlett, quickly and earnestly but in a low voice, as he rose from the table and sprung to the side of the prisoner. "Barnard North, what do you mean by palsying the hands of your friends and telling a falsehood against your own life, in this manner?" 
               "Did the court rightly understand the plea of the prisoner?" asked the Presiding Judge, in a voice husky with emotion; adding at once; "Let the prisoner repeat his plea, so that all can hear it." 
               "Guilty!" again spoke Barnard North, in the same tone, and without reply, either by look or word, to the anxious solicitation of his counsel. 
               "If the prisoner wishes this to be recorded as his plea," said Judge Nichols, still in the same tone of emotion, "it is right that he should be aware that he is pleading guilty of murder in the first degree, called for by one of the counts of the indictment, and that the jury can have no option, under such a plea, but to find him guilty, under the instruction of the court, of the highest crime known to the law." 
               The Presiding Judge had perhaps gone a point, in those words, beyond either legal precedent or propriety; but he was no doubt willing to take his chances, both before the people and at the bar of God, on such a course of conduct; and there are men like him, even to-day, who do not strain after undue convictions for crime, and who scorn to use those advantages held by the law against either the ignorant or the reckless who may form the weaker party. 
               Barnard North made no answer to this tacit appeal of the Judge; but his wife rose with an effort from her position, startled the court with one long cry of agony and fear which made every limb shiver and every cheek turn pale, and uttered the heart-rending words: "Barnard North, in the name of God!-would you kill both yourself and me at one blow? Guilty? You are not guilty, you know you are not, as every one in this court knows it!" 
               But here even the strength born of excitement failed the overwrought woman, and she sunk heavily back in her chair, while Bartlett threw himself before the prisoner, as if to stand in the breach made by his maddened will,-and addressed the court in words long remembered by all who heard: 
               "May it please the Court-this is madness-rank, errant madness! My client, who has committed no crime, would murder himself, and this honorable court would perhaps sit calmly by and permit the sacrifice,-under some terrible apprehension. I protest against such an immolation being permitted, in the name of all that is revered in law and honored in the characters of those who administer it!" 
               "Mr. Bartlett, these observation are irregular," said Judge Nichols, but in a low tone and with a manner which showed that he only did so as a matter of form and not of feeling. He said no more, and Bartlett went on, with scarcely a pause: 
               "My client evidently understands the Court to ask whether he killed the man Gilbert Davis, alias Lemuel Carter. That he did so, we are well aware. Many here present-myself-this honorable Court-saw the blow which so suddenly punished the most dastardly crime known to humanity-a crime worse than a thousand murders, because it strikes at the very foundation of society and makes all administration of justice impossible. Perjury and the deliberate preparation of false evidence with intent to destroy!-think of what that man committed, that brought him to his death. We all saw the deed of violence, I say; but neither I, nor those of the spectators who saw the deed, nor yet the Court, believes that he committed the crime of murder-that he committed any crime of which the law is called to take cognizance, in ridding the earth, under the sudden and irresistible influence of a just resentment, of a mosnter who had too long burdened it. Not one of us, had the case been ours, and had we possessed the strength which God had given to my client and which he had so often and so nobly exerted in the cause of perilled humanity-not one of us but would have struck such a blow and gloried in having done the deed! Not one of us thought, at the moment of witnessing the homicide, that any crime whatever had been committed in the act. I appeal to Judge, to spectators, to all-which of you thought of crime the moment after Gilbert Davis fell dead!" 
               The speaker paused, and just for one instant perfect silence fell within the court-room. Involuntarily each, from Judge to spectator, without doubt at that instant turned the vision inward; and if they did so, which of them did not realise the profundity of the truth then spoken-that at the moment referred to no one had thought of crime in the connection! Then the lawyer went on: 
               "And now I ask for justice-no mercy but justice-in the name not only of Barnard North but the whole wronged and outraged world! I protest against this mad plea being received and put upon record, even if the prisoner is reckless enough to offer it! The Court, then, and not my client, would be doing a murder at which the whole earth must shudder while heaven drew back with no power to forgive!" 
               How every word of those low, sweet but penetrating tones rang through the court-room, and how they stirred every pulse until it beat in very agony! The judges could scarcely keep their positions, and at one moment nearly all the audience were on their feet. 
               "The Court must receive a plea made, if it is persisted in," said Judge Nichols, mildly, when the last echo of that voice had died and the restraint been removed-"but the Court would at the same time go beyond the strict line of its duty to urge a retraction of the plea. The prisoner may be taking his own life by the course, and he should be well advised before he adopts it beyond recall!" 
               "Barnard! Oh, Barnard!" broke in words of pain from the lips of Rachael North, who was wringing her hands as she had been on that fatal day on the coast. 
               "My client has only answered in one word," pursued Bartlett, on whose face the light of a new thought seemed at that instant to glimmer. "Will not the Court instruct him to answer more at length and more explicitly, so that we may all understand what he means by the plea of 'guilty'?" 
               "The Court gives the prisoner full permission to do so, and would be glad if he would do himself the justice of an explanation of what he himself understands by his plea," came the answer of the Presiding Judge. 
               All eyes were bent painfully on the giant form of the Wrecker, who perhaps at that moment stood as no man had stood before him since the arraignment of the first homicide. He was silent and apparently immovable, his strong hands still gripping the heavy railing in front. Could nothing move him? Had he no care for his own life or for the lives of those who had been so dear to him within a period that could yet be measured by weeks? Had he turned to stone?-had he gone stark mad under the pressure of shame and wrong? Then came once more the pleading cry of Rachael North, and she flung herself upon the top of the railing of the dock, grasping his arm with a tension which might have been exercised by his own iron fingers, and screaming, so that every word rang through the court-room like a cry of mortal anguish: 
               "Oh Barnard North! my husband. Speak to them!-do speak to them! Why will you destroy yourself and kill me!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVI. 
               THE QUIET THAT FOLLOWED THE TRIAL. 
               THE excitement in Court at the moment closing the last chapter, was positively fearful, especially to those who knew how madder than all the waves of the sea and all the gathered beasts of prey of the forest, is manhood when aggregated into a mob! What might not be the result of that scene for which no precedent had ever been set in the law-books and no parallel furnished by the history of jurisprudence? The unusual begets the unusual, and sometimes its unnatural child is the impossible! Legally or illegally, what was to be the end? Many faces presented an appearance of anxiety which made them almost as noticeable a spectacle as the man who formed that central and singular figure. More than half the spectators had risen from their seats, and of those who retained them it seemed that the larger proportion were fettered there by nervous weakness rather than kept back by apathy. The Presiding Judge bent his keen and anxious face toward the prisoner's dock; and the local judges by his side gripped the railing of the bench before them almost as severely as did the Wrecker in his place of restraint. The lawyers at the table had all looked up from their making of notes, and stared with faces of blank amazement at the man who was setting them so strange a lesson in the difficulties of criminal law. Every breath was hushed, until through the oppressive silence came an adjuration, from other lips than those of a woman: 
               "Barney North, who has made a lyin' fool of you? Why the devil don't you answer for your life!" 
               It was a strange and irreverent climax to that solemn hush, and a gross outrage upon the propriety of a court-room, that must at any other time have been severely punished; but if any one of the constables had a suspicion of the quarter from which the voice proceeded, not a step was taken towards it. For at that instant the Wrecker spoke again, in a harsh, grating, guttural tone, and every ear listened as if listening for a life. No man can tell what his chance word may accomplish, for good or evil; and what the solicitation of his counsel, the warning of the Judge and the heart-broken pleading of his wife had been apparently powerless to do, seemed to have been done by that voice which Barnard North so well recognized as coming from one of those who had shared his rough pleasures and rougher perils on the coast! Is comradery sometimes even stronger than the ties of blood? Who knows?-certainly there was that in this interruption and its effect, which might go far to support such a theory. 
               "You want me to answer, do you?" spoke the Wrecker, his head once more erect but his brows lowered and the heavy eyes looking out almost in black defiance from beneath them. "You want me to answer the question you ask? How can I answer it any better than you have done it yourselves? You know that I killed Gil Davis-that is, you saw me strike him, and they say that he died from the blow. I suppose you call that 'murder,' and if so, why, I murdered him. You'd better send home all these people, and not run the county to expense, tryin' me, when you know all about it already! I killed the man-leastwise I am ready to suppose that his skull would crack like an egg-shell or his neck break like a rod of black ash. I suppose it is your duty to try why I did it, and whether I did right or wrong. I can't tell ye. I can tell ye why I did it-" 
               Here the Prosecuting Attorney rose, very much excited and said: 
               "May it please the Court-this is altogether irregular and outrageous!" 
               "Sit down, Ben Walker!-sit down!" cried Bartlett, without rising, and in a quicker, sharper, more anxious voice than any man in that court had ever heard him use; and the Prosecuting Attorney, looking for the moment into the face of the Presiding Judge and seeing no sign that he was to be supported, sank again into his seat with a look of impatience on his face. 
               "The prisoner at the bar will proceed!" said the Judge, mildly, and his voice evidently broken by contending emotions. "It is the desire of the Court to have his full plea, in whatever shape he chooses to make it." He cast a glance at the local judges who sat beside him: each of them nodded in silence, and after a moment more of pause the Wrecker went on: 
               "I said that I could tell why I killed that man, though I couldn't tell whether the act was right or not, accordin' to the law books. That man-Gil Davis, with another name, as they say-was a beach-pirate and a scoundrel. It is a rough thing to say about a dead man, but I've got to say it if I say anything! He made his livin' by stealin' off the shore or anywhere else where he could lay his hands upon anything worth takin' and by keeping a groggery where he sold bad liquor that made men good for nothin' and kept them away from their families and their business. They did say that he kept a gambling-house, too, but I don't know anything about that-only hearsay. Well, such men and their places bring a bad name on all of us, when people don't say too much good of us any way; and I have tried to catch him in his tricks. He was too smart for me, generally, but he always knew that I was lookin' out for him. Two or three times he had tried to get even with me; but maybe some of the boys on the shore liked me, and he didn't hurt me any more than a snappin' dog. Bye-and-bye there came a big sorrow on me-" 
               There were sounds of laboring and suppressed breath in court, and hard hands wiped away tears that were flowing down unaccustomed channels. Nine tenths of all in the court-room, long before that time, had learned what was that "big sorrow," and through what a God-like exercise of self-sacrificing bravery it had fallen. The Wrecker himself for a moment broke down, and his hands crept up unwittingly to his face, then sunk down again and none could tell whether or not he had shed a tear. Rachael North leaned against the railing of the dock and sobbed convulsively. 
               "-Bye-and-bye there came a big sorrow on me: I lost my boy-my oldest boy. I won't say how I lost him. Maybe there's some of the people here who know; but I lost him, drowned under my very eyes and when my hand could almost reach out and save him. That man, when I was in the very midst of my sorrow, took the chance to ruin me, and he did it! He made everybody believe me a thief and a scoundrel-" 
               "No, not everybody-not everybody, Barnard!" Rachael North broke out, regardless of all that should have restrained her; but even that interruption was unnoticed, in the pressure of the general excitement, and the rough narrator proceeded. 
               "He made the whole country think me a thief, and he flung me into a prison. I had never been in a prison before; and such things don't feel good or sound well to us who have been brought up where the wind and the water are free. I would rather have died, but I didn't-we can't always die when we wish, any more than we can always save those we'd give our lives to keep! Well, after I had lain in prison until I suppose that half the man had gone out of me and some devil came in instead of it-they brought me up here. Then I saw that black villain stand before me, trying to swear away my character and my liberty; and I heard from the lips of one of his own scoundrels whom he had ruined long ago, that he had done all this to destroy me; and then-and then-" 
               Here the narrator paused for an instant, as if he could not go on; and in that pause Bartlett leaped to his feet with a suddenness which electrified the whole assemblage, throwing out his low, sweet voice in a tone that swelled almost to thunder in its volume and distinctness, and catching the word from the faltering lips: 
               "And then-then you struck him to the floor, Barnard North, without intending absolutely to kill him-without knowing whether you would kill him or not-struck him as any honest and outraged man should have done, if we are not to become a nation of cowards and milk-sops-ridded the earth of a black-hearted wretch-did what heaven's lightning does when it falls on the guilty head and no man questions it-did your duty-committed no murder! Clerk of the court, record the plea of the prisoner-'Not Guilty!'" 
               "I protest-I except-" began the Prosecuting Attorney, again rising. 
               "Protest and except as much as you like!" said Bartlett, his voice raised, and his whole mental and bodily system laboring under extreme excitement. "Clerk-record a plea of 'Not Guilty.'" 
               "The clerk will record such a plea," ordered the Presiding Judge, dropping quietly back into his seat. "Clearly the intention of the prisoner is to say that what he did was done under intense provocation that for the moment deprived him of the use of his rea- son, and that he had no deliberate intention to commit the crime of murder. Let the plea be set down as 'Not Guilty.'" 
               "Oh, thank God! thank God!" sobbed the poor wife, again audibly, as she sank back in her chair, from her half-standing position against the railing; and a buzz of congratulation went round the court, that it needed the full voice of the crier, loudly exerted, to repress. The crisis was past, and overstrained feeling could once more flow back into natural channels. The prisoner at the bar seemed the least excited, meanwhile, of all gathered within the close-packed walls of the court-room. 
               Thenceforward there was little of complication in the course of the Wrecker's second trial, which yet presented some of the most singular features known to the history of criminal prosecutions. The testimony of two of the constables who had witnessed the homicide, and of the surgeon who had examined the body of Gil Davis, was all that the State thought it necessary to offer; and the defence could offer none except that of a few of the shoremen, who pressed eagerly forward when called, as to the upright, honorable and even benevolent character which the Wrecker of Topsail had always borne, previous to his misfortunes. Of the three or four who have thus far most prominently figured in this narration, only one was called-Uncle Zeke Robbins; and he probably produced more sensation in the mind of the Presiding Judge by the undeniable fact that he was looking him straight in the face with one droll eye, while the other was studying the motions of the lawyers at the green table-than even his graphic certificate of character effected in the minds of the jury. 
               "You ask me what kind of a man Barney North allus wus, afore this trouble happened to him?" said Uncle Zeke. "Well, all I kin say is that if God A' mighty-savin' your honor's presence-ever made any more jest as good men as Barney North, he kept the rest of'em home and didn't let 'em come down here! I'd ha' traded my own brother away for him, any time, if I'd ever be'n so fort'net as to had one; and I'd ha' helped drown the man that said or done anything agin' him, jest as quick as I would a blind puppy! I don't know as I kin say much more, gen'l-men!" 
               "No-that will do, Mr. Robbins," said Bartlett quietly referring to his notes for the name. "You could not say more, if you spoke a week!" Nor could he! Homely and ill-delivered as was that testimony, in bad grammar and from a mouth awry, which of us would not hold ourselves prouder than any crowned king in the universe, to have those who know us best and meet with us most intimately, speak the same words in our behalf, warm alike from lips and heart, in the day of question! 
               No long time was consumed in the taking of the small amount of testimony thus involved; and it is to the credit of both leading counsel to say that no attempt at seizing an undue advantage seemed to be made by either. 
               When the Court adjourned for the day, as the evening lamps were just lighted within the frost-gemmed windows of the town, and the Wrecker and his wife descended again to the cell where he was confined-even the hard face of the prisoner was lighted up with more of human feeling; and the kindly and cheerful looks of the thinning crowd through whom they pressed to the door of the courtroom, showed that the extreme peril of the situation was believed to be over. 
               It was ten o'clock on the morning following, when the bell rung for the re-assembling of the court; and so deep and intense was the interest yet remaining, that every place within the spacious room appeared to be filled, before that hour, with the same form and face which had vacated it on the previous evening. It might almost have seemed that the whole audience had retained their places, inert and speechless as the suite of the Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, all the night long, until the bell had acted like a tocsin and called them again to sense and action. 
               By mutual consent any arguments on the part of the junior counsel were waived, and the summing up of the seniors alone depended upon for placing the case in a proper light before the jury. So rapidly had sympathy for the accused grown among the audience, under the circumstances accompanying the opening, that nearly all seemed to expect an unconditional acquittal or a verdict of "justifiable homicide." Not so with Bartlett, painfully aware of the obligations supposed to be laid upon men by statute, and skillful in reading the faces of others as he was imprudently candid in allowing his own to be perused by any one who would take the trouble to read carefully. He saw hard faces in the jury-box-only two or three of them, it was true, but enough to interfere with the generous impulses of the others, to make an acquittal difficult, and even to threaten a conviction on some one of the higher counts of the indictment. Ah, those two or three hard faces among softer and more impressible men-those Pharisees of the jury-box, who seem to be perpetually tithing the mint and annise and cummin of what is called "the strict letter of the law," and aiding to ignore, more than half the time, the judgment, mercy and truth for which that law was really established!-who has not seen them in their places of temporary power and wished that they could be bartered away for a corresponding number of feet of stone wall or cord-wood? 
               But in that box there were sympathizing faces as well-earnest faces, behind which no gazer could doubt the existence of warm hearts and enlarged views, coupled with de- termination to do substantial justice, so far as evidence could indicate in what direction it lay, and illumined by those aspirations after light from beyond natural sources, without which humanity is but a clod waiting for the life-giving principle to be imparted. It was upon the latter that Walter Bartlett opened his battery of eloquence-his flood of alternate withering sarcasm and plaintive appeal, intermingled with enough for practical purposes, of those hard, dry statements of law and fact without which, to some of the best of men, appeal and argument are alike powerless. 
               "Look on the prisoner at the bar, gentlemen of the jury!" he concluded, while the Wrecker still seemed to keep his hard, heavy eye upon him as if he could even suspect, now, that fervent, impassioned manner,-and while the sad eyes of Rachael North seemed bent upon him in piteous pleading and her clasped hands motioning a prayer that his words might find entrance to every heart. "Look upon the prisoner, gentlemen! See what he is, standing there in his great grief and shame! Think of what he was, but a few short weeks ago, when his hand was the readiest and his arm the strongest of all who on our wild sea-coast battled for the best interests of humanity-when the open sea was no more expansive than his heart, nor the storm wind stronger than his noble purpose! Look at him now-think of him then; and remember that virtually no act of his has come between his past prosperity and his present suffering-that the hands of others have really wrought him all this shame and wrong. He was arraigned here on a most shameful charge, perilling his liberty and ruining his character. Nearly all of you, no doubt, were here, when that charge was disproved and the very tongue that uttered it blistered by detection. At the very moment of discovery that black-hearted liar stood before him-within reach of his arm-so close that it had but to fall and the deed was done. If for one moment he erred, giving way to the honest and indignant impulses of his nature, and if that momentary forgetfulness cost a life, can he be held criminally responsible? No!-a thousand times, No! He did not strike to kill-he struck to punish! Accident, and no doubt some physical malformation of that man who was mentally so deformed, made the blow fatal. For assault-and-battery, or contempt of Court, both of which my client unquestionably committed, he might have been indicted with some show of justice; but for murder or even for manslaughter-the very idea aims at the right of personal protection of every man in the community. And which of you, who saw that day the clenched fists and glaring eyes of the convicted liar in the moment of his detection, can say that he was not ready to spring at the throat of the man he so hated-that the prisoner, shut up and hampered in his box, did not see the threatening motion more quickly than others, and in that blow merely exercise the unquestionable right of personal self-defence? I tell you, gentlemen of the jury, that this prosecution, under any of the counts it includes, is wrong!-shameful!-monstrous! If for one moment he went beyond the bound of manhood's privilege, and went farther than he intended, has he not already been sufficiently punished? Ask the face pale and sallow from confinement within loath some prison-walls!-ask the heart-broken wife who with those clasped hands of mute entreaty begs you to give her back her husband! Justice is not vengeance: only those should be restrained of liberty who prove themselves unfit for it by the commission of premeditated and indefensible wrong. This Court is called upon-you, gentlemen, are called upon-not for mercy-we scorn the word!-but for justice-that justice which will restore to liberty, and protect in the enjoyment of that liberty, a man all whose antecedents have been noble, manly, and except in one moment of overwrought feeling, worthy of all imitation! Hark!" and as he spoke every auditor found himself listening as if for some far-off sound that must not be lost at peril of a life-"hark! do you not hear the roar of the waves on Topsail beach, the how! of the winter storm-wind that is ever sweeping there? Both are demanding at your hands, with the irrepressible voices of nature, the freedom of this man who has so long dared the one and ridden the other, in the holiest of all interests known to self-sacrificing humanity!" 
               Among the many hundreds who swayed hither and thither under that impassioned appeal, few forgot it for many a day; and when it closed and the counsellor sat down, wiping from his broad brow the sweat which effort and excitement had forced there in thick-hanging beads-a buzz of admiration and assent followed, instantly checked again by the harsh voice of the crier: "Silence in the court!" Even the hard faces were somewhat softened-the more sympathetic members of the jury, with half the audience, were in tears-and it would have been safe, at that moment, to presume on a verdict of unconditional acquittal for the prisoner. 
               It was under very different circumstances that the Prosecuting Attorney, Walker, rose to speak that "last word" which legal practice, for some occult reason which not all the world are yet able to understand, has accorded to the stronger party instead of the weaker-to the accuser instead of the accused. He was a tall, dark man, with a delivery hard but fluent, and little swayed by the softer emotions. Like many other men bred to the law, he considered it a duty to win when once enlisted in any cause; and only the evident sympathy of the court and the spectators had kept him in the present instance within that strict bound of courtesy and forbearance which he had undoubtedly maintained. Now, with that "last word" at his command, he seemed to have forgotten that influence, and he threw his whole might into the task of representing the act of the prisoner as one of wilfully murderous character. How the hard faces set again as he uttered his opening words!-how the sympathetic faces dried their compelled tears and put on a look of hopeless pain instead! Oh, words! words!-when hurled out by learned and eloquent lips, how much more powerful and more deadly are ye than the cutting hail of heaven or the iron storm of bullets in battle! No man can measure your might or your influence: wo to him who uses ye wantonly or in premeditated wrong! One by one the beautiful creations of Bartlett fell before the subtle assaults of the Prosecuting Attorney; one by one, position after position was rendered untenable, until the eye of the prisoner glared on him with a ferocity which few men would have cared to encounter with the opportunity for vengeance nigh at hand. 
               "Never," he said, "since the first impromptu court of justice was empanneled for the protection of life and property in some rude and barbarous age, has a crime of the same atrocity as this upon which you are called to pronounce, been set on record. A murder in court-think of the phrase and what it means!-the prisoner at the bar, because some words spoken do not chance to please his sense of personal dignity, taking upon himself, in the very presence of the Judge sitting for the trial of his previous crime, the functions of judge, jury and executioner, and sending out of the world, without one instant's mercy that the victim might have time to syllable a prayer,-a man who stood there as a witness and consequently under the twice-sacred protection of the law! The falsehood of the testimony of that victim has been assumed, but not proved: if that man was a vagabond, what was he who discredited his evidence and made the accusation against him? one infinitely lower in the social scale-one ten times more likely than the comparatively respectable Gilbert Davis, to have spoken falsely! It is evident, from the prisoner's own confession in his plea, that there was, and had been for years, bad blood between himself and his victim; who can say that the second and more favorable witness may not have been suborned by the many and active friends, of the prisoner-yes, the many and friends, gentlemen of the jury!" and he swept his eye round the courtroom as if he saw and distinctly recognised every man who had shown sympathy for the Wrecker in his face-"at once to clear the guilty Barnard North, and ruin the innocent Gilbert Davis whom he hated? Nay, to go one step further-who can say that the blow which killed him may not have been aimed in a transport of hate and malice which had been seething for years and could no longer be restrained, instead of being the vaunted revenge of outraged honor! A crime has been committed, in the public sight and in open defiance of the very ministers of law; that crime cannot and must not be made a virtue by any false sympathy, however speciously excited by eloquent paid advocates and weeping women! That crime must be expiated, or henceforth the boldest homicide will be held the best member of society, and the very name of law will become a scoff and a mockery!" 
               But when once warmed with his subject, the Prosecuting Attorney was not the man to pause at the boundary of either prudence or propriety. He met the warm eulogiums of his opponent on the noble character of the shoremen, with broad allegations of their well-known habit of violence and their more than doubtful reputation on the score of honesty. He alluded to the fact that a rescue had been attempted in the case of the very man on trial, and officers of the law maltreated and nearly murdered. He pointed to the shoremen as a class from whom such men as the prisoner might be expected to be derived-men of the high hand and the revengeful heart; and he demanded that an example should be made at once-a fearful example, not soon to be forgotten. 
               Could the lawyer have seen the flashing eyes and the knitted brows of many who occupied the more obscure portions of the court-room, he might have paused in his bitterness of denunciation; for such men as those whom he scourged are fiery in their enmity as they are ardent in their friendship, and upon no back does the lash of injustice fall with an effect longer to be remembered. Many a deed of violence has been born of such words: they are ever unwise utterances. But if Walker had failed to produce so favorable an effect upon the audience assembled, he had succeeded in moving the jury, in a different direction, quite as forcibly as his opponent; and in the increasing number of hardened faces, and the hot dryness of every eye in the jury-box, as he sat down, might have been discerned a feeling then bearing quite as heavily against the prisoner as the touching and eloquent appeal of Bartlett had left them disposed in his favor. 
               Probably in a long life passed in the practice of criminal law, Presiding Judge Nichols had never at any moment stood in a more delicate position than that now devolved upon him. That his sympathies, as a man, were with the prisoner, was beyond question: that as an officer of the law, fulfilling one of its very highest functions, he saw conviction and punishment a thing almost inevitable, is equally certain. The sympathy which would probably bias the action of the jury towards mercy, if the desire of his heart could find utterance through his lips, would be a contravention of that most solemn of oaths under whose shadow he sat. In this dilemma but few words best became him, and but few he uttered. Nicely and with delicate consideration he balanced the conflicting sides of the momentous question, reminding the jury, meanwhile, that the facts of the case were well known and by no means involved in mystery, and that they, not he, must decide what crime, if any, had been committed by the prisoner in the act for which he stood arraigned. 
               Night had again closed upon Clayboro Court-house and town, when the jury retired to deliberate. At his own request Barnard North was not removed to his cell during the recess ordered by the court, but sat in the dock, his head leaning on his left hand and his elbow on his knee, while Rachael North crept close to the railing and reached through her hand to take his hard, large palm in hers, awaiting the event with feverish fear and anxiety. The Wrecker himself, during that period of inevitably-awful suspense, the end of which must take away life or liberty or send him out again into the world a free man,-seemed to be as little shaken as he had been throughout the least trying portions of the ordeal. 
               One of the constables went out, unbidden, as a large part of the audience dispersed to obtain some refreshment, waiting the call of the Court-house bell to re-assemble,-went out, and returned with some plain food which he put into the hands of Barnard North and the wife who seemed now to be his shadow. Neither rejected the food, but neither ate as in ordinary life. The husband choked down a small portion of the nutriment, seeming even in that action scarcely to move his set teeth as another might have done; while the wife toyed with a few crumbs, gave up the futile attempt, and drew back into the partial shadow cast by the dock beside which she was sitting. So condemned men often eat, they say, when the executioner is waiting without-forcing down food in bravado if not from necessity: so those who are bidding them farewell for the last time, find the swallowing of a mouthful impossible, and the living fast while the dying eat! Was the awful shadow of death, then, looming over the Wrecker of Topsail, that these conditions of the execution morning were being so unwittingly but so certainly fulfilled? 
               Something more than an hour passed, and then the loungers in the bar-rooms and in the vestibules of the Court-house were startled by the suddenness of the expected summons. The old bell again tolled out with its heavy iron clang, announcing that the recess of the Court was over-that the jury had agreed upon their verdict, and that the fate of Barnard North, so far as it hung on the voices of his fellow laymen,-was definitely sealed, Rapidly the truant Court and the spectators came crowding back to the room, now dimly lighted by twenty or thirty candles in the heavy candelabra hanging from the ceiling, and by a few others dispersed over the judges' desk and the lawyers' table. One by one, escorted by the constables, the jury followed their foreman back into the room and resumed their places. What is it that these men, invested with a transient but a fearful power, have to say of you, Strafford?-Russell?-Charles of England?-Louis of France? For as they speak-and they are mortal and very fallible-the life-blood courses on in your veins or you lie to-morrow headless clods! What is it that these men say of you, Barnard North, Wrecker of Topsail? 
               "Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?" asked Presiding Judge Nichols, for the time taking that duty out of the hands of the Clerk, and speaking in a voice which slightly quavered in spite of himself. 
               "We have agreed," answered the foreman, rising. 
               "How say you?-Is the prisoner guilty or not guilty, on any of the counts named in the indictment?" 
               "Guilty of manslaughter in the second degree," was the answer of the foreman, delivered slowly and firmly. 
               "Mr. Clerk, poll the jury," said Bartlett, retaining his seat, his face shadowed by grief and disappointment and his voice husky and broken. 
               The Clerk rose. "Peter Brown, is this your verdict? William Wilson, is this your verdict? John H. Somers, is this your verdict?" and so on through the whole monotonous twelve; but, alas! to each demand there came back the conclusive answer-"Yes!" and the last hope was swept away! No other word-no recommendation to the mercy of the Court-a bald, blank conviction, however low in count! 
               No one present saw the face of Barnard North change at the announcement of a verdict which must consign him for a term of years to the State Prison. (At that time, and in that State of which the County of Seaboard formed a part, the penalty for the second degree of manslaughter was not less than two nor more than five years in that disgraceful confinement). No one saw the face of the Wrecker change, except as a firmer compression of the lip may have been noticed, or a tighter grip of the fingers on the railing of the dock; but Rachael North gave one long, low scream in which mental agony was terribly expressed, started to her feet, cast one frighted glance at judge and jury, then gave vent in a voice between a wail and a scream to the words: "My husband guilty! You cannot say that he is guilty! Oh, my God!" and fell heavily for- ward on the floor towards the table occupied by the lawyers. Pitying hands at once raised and bore her from the room, her husband only taking one single glance at her as she was borne away, and uttering no word of either anxiety or direction. 
               There was a low, growling undertone of discontent with the verdict, observable in the back part of the court-room, and several persons caused disturbance by leaving the room immediately after Rachael North had been carried away. Low in count as that verdict unquestionably was, if any law for the punishment of homicidal violence was to be regarded-the bulk of the audience had been swayed by the incidents of the earlier portion of the trial, and expected an unconditional acquittal. Such, too, had been the hope of the Wrecker's wife; though there was no reason to suppose that Barnard North himself, from the moment when he had been outraged and surprised into taking the life of Gil Davis, had believed that he could entirely escape punishment. But there was a muttering thunder in this growl of discontent from the shoremen and country people in the back of the court-room, the event of which could not very well be calculated. 
               Two or three times the crier was obliged to raise his voice loudly, with his stereotyped cry of "Silence in the Court!" and two or three of the constables, staff in hand, were obliged to threaten the malcontents somewhat roughly, before the partial tumult subsided. Then, though not with his usual popular background of silence, Judge Nichols discharged the jury and ordered the prisoner to be removed, the court to be adjourned, and the convicted man to be brought up for sentence on the following morning. All seemed to understand, either of their own knowledge or as others gave them the whispered information, what that sentence would be-the lowest in the power of the kind-hearted Judge, but still terribly severe for the ruined man who had been virtually driven into crime as well as punishment-two years at hard labor in the State Prison!
                
               "To be sentenced to-morrow, eh?" said Dick Decker, who had been one of the troublesome people lately provoking the voice of the crier,-to Uncle Zeke Robbins, who had been another,-as both were leaving the court-room and the prisoner was about being removed. 
               "Let me see-they put them irons on 'em after they are sentenced, don't they?" was the enquiring reply of Uncle Zeke. 
               "I believe so," said Decker. 
               "Humph!-then you know time's flyin', if that's the case! But a good deal can be done in a little while, when you have the right kind of things to do it with-as Suke Beamish said when she married two fellows and ran away with the third one without be-in' married to him at all-all in the same night!" So once more commented Uncle Zeke, still in the same low voice, as they passed out through the dismal and half-lighted hall of the Court-house to the snowy yard. 
               "Yes-to-night and no later, Uncle Zeke!" was the enigmatical reply of Decker. 
               Any ear that might have caught these words caught no more, for the speakers were now out in the open yard, with the trodden snow crunching under their feet. In a moment or two after, they, with other shoremen who joined them as the crowd pressed out of the court-room, had disappeared. 
               Gradually and yet rapidly quiet fell upon the building where so lately all had been bustle, anxiety and commotion. The crowd had melted away, almost as quickly if not as silently as the phantoms of Belgrade. Barnard North, more closely guarded now than before, from the fact that he was a convicted felon, but not yet manacled as he would be after the hour of his sentence and until that of his removal to the State Prison-had been taken back for the last time to his cell. Approaching midnight began to produce its effect upon the snow-beleaguered town; one by one the rays disappeared from the frosted windows in the neighborhood; the fronts of the taverns grew closed and silent, whatever may have been the amount of activity in some of the drinking and gambling rooms in the rears, up-stairs; and only a single light, kept always burning in the head-turnkey's room, looked out over the snow from a loop-hole of the Court-house. Quiet on the town, after all the excitement of the past day; even as the sad and hopeless quiet of legal conviction had fallen on the before-unsettled fortunes of the Wrecker of Topsail. Quiet-like that which reigned in Nineveh only an hour before Sardanapalus ascended his funeral pyre to escape the devastating Medes: quiet-like that which lay on sleeping Schenectady and Deerfield in the last hours before the red hand of the Indian lit the redder torches of their conflagration. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVII. 
               FIRE, AND BATTLE, AND MURDER, AND SUDDEN DEATH. 
               A FEW hundred yards west from the middle of the town of Clayboro, on a cross street running off from the main thoroughfare, stood a second rate inn (second rate, even for that section of country), called the "Gig Tavern," and frequented a little by the fast riders of the township, and still more by the wagoners with wood and coal from the pines at the southward, and the fish-carters on their way from the shore section towards the great inland city lying some fifty or sixty miles westward. The "Gig," from its free-and-easy character not less than its comparative cheapness of charge, naturally became the shoremen's resort when any occasion of peculiar importance called them to Clayboro; and the trial of Barnard North had filled it to repletion with men from the coast line. Not less than thirty or forty of them were there domiciled, besides half a dozen of the coal-begrimmed men from the southern pines; and perhaps a more hardy or a more reckless set of men of the same number could not have been found within the seas that girt the continents. Something of the character of at least a part of these men has before been noted, in the various occurrences involved in this narration. 
               At half an hour before midnight some twenty of those men were assembled in the large drinking and smoking room (let us add, gambling room) of the "Gig," adjoining the bar and communicating with it by a door through which the fiery and exhilarating stimulants were brought in as ordered by one or another of the party. The trial of that day had concluded too late in the evening for any of those belonging at a great distance from town to have gone home, under any circumstances, and especially through the deeplying snow; and too much excitement had been accumulated during the day at that trial, to permit any one of them to sleep without the supervention of some counter excitement of drowsy tendency-liquor or tobacco. 
               Conversation had been confined to the great event just concluded, as was to have been expected; and not one of all those rough men but believed that after the exhibition of the prisoner's motive in his sudden and violent deed, he should have been immediately acquitted. Not one, probably, but had imbibed enough of stimulating liquid to place him beyond either the bounds of strict justice or of prudence. What preliminary conversation had taken place-what arrangements had previously been made for overt acts of violence with reference to the fate of the Wrecker in case of his conviction, can never be known; and any guess at them might be seriously at fault, even taking after-events as a criterion. Men who have occasion for the quick eye, the ready hand and the faculty of instant determination, in the daily peril of life on the most treacherous of elements, learn to do all things with lightning speed; and it is not easy to predicate their past upon their present. All that can be known, is that at about the hour named, nearly midnight, among the occupants of that room, holding conversation over their glasses of hot liquor, their bad cigars and strong pipes, affairs assumed a strange and threatening aspect that any man might have discerned but that few could have explained. Most of the prominent shoremen from Topsail beach were there; and seated in a clumsy arm chair in the midst of them sat Uncle Zeke, whose eyes seemed even more erratic and tangent than ever. Near him were Dick Decker and Tom Collins, and brawny figures and bronzed faces filled up the whole background of the dingy room with its untidy floor and stained walls. 
               Conversation on the all-engrossing subject had lagged for a moment, and some of the inmates of the room seemed to be listening, when there was a tap at the door and Sim Radstock entered, his face, spite of the coldness of the night, apparently heated with hard labor, and something more of the Cur de Lion swagger in his gait than was usual even with him. He took a seat, some one shoved him a glass of liquor which he tossed off at a throw, and then there was a brief interval of silence. 
               "Is there any man here who b'lieves that Barney North oughtn't to have been 'quitted by them cusses of jurymen?" asked Uncle Zeke, finally, rising at a sign of impatience from Radstock and taking occasion to make a hasty inspection of the soiled floor and the smoked ceiling at the same instant. "Ef there is any sich man, we friends of Barney North, who haven't anything agin his havin' his own opinion, want him to rise and say as much, so's we kin know how things stand!" 
               No one rose. 
               "'Cause," said Uncle Zeke, continuing, "some of us are goin' to hold a meetin' here jest now, to see what kin be done for a new trial. We don't want any one to be here that is agin us, and we won't have any one long, that's more of the yarn! Ef there's any one here that don't want to go the whole figure for Barney North and his friends, we just want him to get up and go out, without any more palaver, and nobody'll hurt him if he only keeps still!" 
               Still no one stirred. 
               "All right, I guess, Uncle Zeke!" said Dick Decker, casting a scrutinizing glance around the room, where he seemed to know most of the faces and find grounds for confidence in the remainder. 
               "Wa-a-a-I, yes, I guess so," answered Uncle Zeke, after repeating that precaution. "And if there is anybody here who expects to play foul, he had better wish he had gone out, for some one of us won't lose sight of him till he's under six feet of sod or five fathom of salt water!" 
               "Go-a-head!" importuned Sim Radstock, impatient of the delay. 
               "Wa-a-a-l," again drawled Uncle Zeke, "that any of you who don't know what's comin' may git an idea-we're a-goin' to take Barney North out o' that there prison cell before we're an hour older. Maybe some of you hain't heard of the plan afore, and may be some of you have! Is there any- body here who won't help do it? Tom, jest take a peep to see that there ain't nobody o' the wrong sort a listenin' at that door!" 
               That precaution, too, was taken, and then Uncle Zeke went on: 
               "Jest as many of you as mean to help, stand up on your feet and let's see how big you are!" 
               Every man in the room-a number of not less than thirty, now-rose with more or less alacrity, those least informed perhaps manifesting more hesitation than some of the others. Nine tenths of the men were shoremen or persons living within sound of the surf-the balance was made up of the dark faces and long forms of the coal-carters from the southward. Many of them stout and stalwart-all of them hard and rugged looking-faces much more likely to have been selected by Salvator Rosa for their picturesque ruffianism or by William Hogarth for their droll oddity, than by Peter Paul Rubens for their cherubic appearance or Antony Vandyke as types of aristocratic beauty. But faces that had little weakness, no cowardice and no indecision-faces that could be depended upon, quite as much in foul as fair weather. Among them all, as they rose, towered the herculean but athletic bulk of Sim Radstock; though, sooth to say, he was not just then the leader he looked, while that little, wiry, wry-faced old man stood in the same presence! 
               "All up, Uncle Zeke!" said Dick Decker, in an exulting tone. 
               "That will do, then-it's a good hearin', and we're all ready to go ahead!" answered Uncle Zeke. "But how many of 'em did you find, Sim?" 
               "I've been to thirty-two door-yards and wood-piles," said Sim, blowing a long breath at the recollection," and Tom and me has brought twenty-eight-axes, two hatchets and a crow-bar. There don't many of 'em take in their choppers out of the frost!" he added, with a chuckle. 
               "Where is Tom Hovey?" asked Robbins. 
               "Tom is out at old Blodgett's barn, a little ways back of the yard-least ways he was, a little while ago, carryin' straw like seven pigs when a storm's comin' on. We didn't have no occasion to take the wood very far, for there was two cord of it, all dry and split, and laid right against the board fence, intended for the use of the prison," was Sim's answer. 
               "Ya-a-a-s, well, then, we'll use it for the prison, and nobody kin blame us!" drily answered Uncle Zeke. "But where is Joe Harrison?" 
               "Here!" answered that person, still more red-faced and trembling than in October, advancing from the stove where he had been toasting himself outside with a glow from the heated iron and inside with a vigorous pull of hot whiskey. "Didn't you think I'd be here?" 
               "I knowed you'd be here, Joe Harrison-somewhere about!" replied Uncle Zeke. "I heerd the purtiest girl in the county say that she was goin' to ask you to come up-" 
               "Lettice Holloway? yes, so she did-she asked me to come up, yesterday, with some more money for the lawyers, from the old Squire and some of the neighbors; and she knew that I'd drive through purgatory to please her. But some of that money, I say, Uncle Zeke-" 
               "Well, what about it?" asked the old man, as he hesitated. 
               "Some of it came-I know it did-from that rich New York chap that has been hang-in' around the Eagle, off and on, all winter; and I'd rather carry fire in my pocket, than that!
                
               "You mean young Denniston? What hev you got agin him?" Both Uncle Zeke and the ruined young spendthrift were speaking in a lower voice and half aside. 
               "What have I got agin him? Everything! He's after her, and I've seen it! I've seen them together, and seen that she likes him-she that never seemed to like anybody before. Do you think she will marry him, Uncle Zeke?" This was said in a still lower tone and in a voice that was absolutely piteous in its pleading earnestness. And if Uncle Zeke lied roundly in reply, not all the fault could be attributed to his anxiety to keep Joe Harrison in good tune for that night's adventure-something was to be set down to pity and the desire to console, however roughly. 
               "She marry him! Bah, you haven't half lost her yet, Joe Harrison! Think she'd send you on errands if she didn't care for you? No-stick to her, and she may take a ride behind them hosses yit!" 
               "Do you think so? You don't know how good you make me feel, Uncle Zeke! What more'll you take?" 
               "Nothin' more, Joe-no time now," answered the old man to this peculiarly American mode of manifesting gratitude. "Come-where's your cattle and the sled?" 
               "Thunder and Lightning is out there under the shed!" answered poor Joe, his face aglow with new life under the double incentive of Uncle Zeke's comfort and an allusion to his horses. "I will have 'em round on the back street there in a few minutes; and if anybody else's horses can go across the country to Bush Inlet as quick as they can, I'll list give them away in the morning-that's all!" 
               "Come, then, boys-it's high water!" said Uncle Zeke, who must have had some signal in that out-of-place sea-shore allusion; and one by one the apparent conspirators left the tavern by the back door and dropped away towards the quarter of the town where stood the Court-house. Joe Harrison, who had taken the bells from his horses, paid his bill at the bar, took another drink, noisily declaring that "he was going down to the Washington to sleep-he was,-then went out to the shed, unfastened his black beauties and removed half-a-dozen of blankets from the glossy hides that glistened in the starlight-and drove half a mile round to the back street where it was very evident that he was to await an escaped prisoner. 
               Half an hour after their leaving the "Gig" had not elapsed, when the whole body of men, without attracting attention, had assembled on the grounds outside of the jail-yard at the rear of the Court-house. The wall was some twelve feet high; but two mow-ladders from a neighboring barn had been secured as a part of the spoil by the raiding Radstock, and one by one they dropped over the wall into the yard on which previous observation had shown that the iron-grated window of Barnard North's cell opened. 
               "Cuss that bell!" said Dick Decker to Robbins, in a low voice. "If the ice wasn't on the roof I could shin to that like a cat and prevent 'em ringing out any alarm if they hear us; but it wouldn't do for a fellow's neck about now." 
               "No," answered Uncle Zeke in the same tone. "We must take things as they are-as Steve Woolley said, when he robbed the hen-house and had to take all roosters 'cause there wasn't any pullets! But if we can only pry off these bars easy enough, and get along without settin' fire to the old abomination-why, we won't care about the bell." 
               Every man had brought his axe over the wall with him, and the straw had been thrown over in quantity sufficient to make a respectable bonfire. Wood there was already in the yard; and the intention of the conspirators evidently was, in the event of discovery or accidental alarm, to fire the jail by the wooden sheds communicating with it, and secure their own escape and that of the prisoner under cover of the conflagration. And it was also evident that the time before the sentence had been chosen because it would find the Wrecker in a better situation to second the effort for his rescue, while unmannacled, than he could be after the event of that fatal formality. 
               Tap! tap! tap! went the hand of Decker against the glass of the window, reached through between the lattice of gratings on the outside; and he uttered in a low but distinct voice, close to the window: 
               "Barnard North! I say, Barnard North!" 
               "Who is there?" came from the rough, harsh voice of the Wrecker, who started up from his first uneasy sleep on the pallet; and those outside heard another voice, gentler and softer, say, in intense alarm: "Oh, Barnard, Barnard-what is it? Have they come to drag you away already?" 
               "Hush!" said the voice of the Wrecker, and those without could hear him approach the window, as he called, much more loudly than prudence could have dictated: "Who is there? What do you want?" 
               "Hush, not so loud, Barney North!" replied Decker, still speaking close to the glass. "It is friends, come to take you out. Is your wife with you?" 
               "Yes," again answered the voice of the Wrecker. "Go away!; You cannot do me any good, and you will only get yourselves into trouble." 
               "Don't speak so loud, I say!" was again the response of Decker, "I tell you that we have come to take you away from those sharks. We are strong enough to do it, and we mean to! We have set you free once before, and you wouldn't go: will you go now, when you see what law is worth, and they have the doors of a State Prison opening for you?" 
               Rachael North was now fully awake, and with a woman's instinct comprehended the whole affair better than her husband. They heard her say, almost in an imprudent scream of joy: "Oh, yes, Barnard-yes! I know that voice-it is Decker! Go with them!-go with them!" 
               "Time is short and we can't wait! Will you go, if we will open this window?" again asked Decker, in a quick and anxious tone. 
               "Yes!" answered the Wrecker from within, in a voice again so loud that it seemed to peril the whole enterprise. 
               "He is willing-he will go!" said Decker, announcing his success to Uncle Zeke and the others who stood near. 
               "Yes, I heard him!" said that worthy. "That State Prison talk has fetched him: I thought it would! Now, men, to work with a will, and don't make any more noise than you would if you was hid in a briar-bush and the devil after you!" 
               In an instant a dozen axes were applied to the gratings of the window, in the effort to pry them loose-the only hope that the prisoner could be released without so much noise as must alarm the Court-house and the town and make the resort to extreme violence inevitable. 
               Two or three of the bars gave way from their ineffectual fastenings in the wall, but as one of them did so, an axe slipped partially from the hand that was wielding it and fell with a heavy bang upon the loosed end of the iron. It rang almost with the sound of a bell, and loud enough to awaken even the soundest sleeper who might chance to be in the immediate neighborhood. 
               "Cuss it!" exclaimed Uncle Zeke Robbins, and with reason. The turnkey, who slept but one room away from the cell of the prisoner, had been partially aroused by the loud words of Barnard North, but dropped away to sleep again. The thud of the iron was so heavy that, coming so soon after the previous sound, it fully aroused him, and he sprung at once from the cot where he or his alternate always slept half-dressed when noted criminals were in confinement. An instant sufficed to open the door without perceptible noise, and he ran rapidly down the passage to the rear of the building. There the voices of the men, though low, were audible, and he could discover that they were at work at the windows of the Wrecker's cell. Instantly he rapped at the door of Sheriff Parker's room, across the passage, called out: "Get up, Sheriff!-there is an attack on the jail!" In a moment more, running rapidly up to the second story, he grasped the rope of the bell which the shoremen had failed to secure; and before the men without were aware that any discovery had really been made, the dull, heavy boom! boom! boom! of the Court-house bell was ringing an alarm to the town! 
               The conspirators heard the first stroke of the clapper and knew all at once. Half a dozen dropped their axes and sprang over the wall, in the belief that all chance of success was lost and that early escape was only commendable prudence. There are such men in every enterprise-in nearly every army! Not so with Robbins, or Radstock, or Decker, or any of the thorough-paced shoremen who had been engaged in the original inception of the enterprise. 
               "Don't stand now!-down with the bars!" sang out the loud voice of Sim Radstock, again a leader the moment that actual violence was under way; and his own axe descended on the grating with a force that sent fragments of them flying at nearly every blow. Every man struck, now, without regard to the noise he made waking a township or even a continent; and bar after bar gave way and fell. 
               "They are coming!" cried some one at that moment hearing the noise within the Court-house and anticipating the worst. 
               "Fire the shed, then, and the sooner the quicker!" rang out the noise of Uncle Zeke, and in a moment the ready hand of one of the shoremen obeyed the injunction. Almost before he had done speaking the whole mass of straw was in a blaze, the light wood was kindling from it and the fire catching and running up the posts and beams of the shed which communicated with the rear or wooden side of the building. The lurid flames shot up and threw the whole rear of the jail and the snow-paved yard into bold relief. Men could be seen running towards the building from all directions, half-clothed, even in the wintry night-some armed with the muskets or fowling-pieces which they had caught down from pegs in their kitchens, some provided only with sticks of wood and pitchforks from the barns, and more than half unarmed and terrified and useless. 
               At that moment enough of the bars of the cell gave way and enough glass and sash crashed under the quick blows, to give admittance to the cell. Robbins and Decker at once sprang in and grasped the Wrecker by the arm, the glare of the fire making every object easily discernible. 
               "Come-hurry away with us, now, for the devils are all up in arms! There is a sleigh waiting for you in the lane!" spoke Decker; and the prisoner, in whom the half-extinguished idea of life and liberty seemed to be anew rekindled, prepared to obey. "Never mind your wife-they won't hurt her!" added Decker, seeing, in the red light, that Barnard North was looking towards her, where she sat cowering on the bed, and hesitating. Then he paused no longer, but sprang through the opening and was hurried towards the ladder which led over the prison wall. 
               Just then the wall was scaled from without by several persons; and at the same instant the inner door of the cell (which no one had thought to fasten or obstruct) burst open, and Sheriff Parker, with three or four turnkeys and several others who had rushed into the Court-house by the front, made their appearance-two of the turnkeys armed with muskets. 
               "The window is down-the prisoner is escaping!" cried the Sheriff, all whose kindness of heart was forgotten when there was a forcible interference with justice. "Shoot him down if he does not come back at once!-shoot him down, I say!" 
               There were probably yet fifteen or twenty of the rescuers remaining within the prison-yard, most of whom were in a hand-to-hand conflict with the new-comers from the outside; while within the jail were heard the shouts of those who were endeavoring to secure the other prisoners or save the burning building. No shots had as yet been fired, as scarcely any one knew, in the haste and confusion whether he should kill friend or foe. Some one had grasped the bell-rope again after the turnkey left it; and above the chaos of sound below, the heavy dull boom! boom! boom! still rang out on the frosty midnight air, as if the local fright needed to be as widely spread as possible. Robbins and Decker had Barnard North by the arms, and were assisting him up the wall while Sim Radstock, his axe dropped after the fall of the window-bars, was keeping the way clear by levelling all comers with such sweeping blows of his fist and arms as might have been given by the whirling spokes of a water wheel in time of freshet. 
               The forces of the conspirators were as yet evidently top strong for those of their opponents, and it was plain that the prisoner would escape and very doubtful whether the jail could be saved from the fast-increasing flames. Just at that moment Sheriff Parker caught sight of the Wrecker and recognized his massive bulk, as he reached the top of the wall and was preparing to descend on the other side. 
                
               "Come back, Barnard North!-come back, in the name of the law!" he shouted; but the response was the figure of the Wrecker beginning to descend. "He is escaping!-there he is at the top of the wall!-shoot him!" to one of the turnkeys. 
               The command was hastily obeyed-too hastily. The frightened officer raised his weapon to fire, but did what many agitated people have done before and since his time-pressed the trigger before he was aware, and the charge exploded while the musket was in the proper line but before he had raised it nearly to the requisite height. There was a piercing scream the instant after the report, and the tall form of the Wrecker suddenly disappeared beyond the wall. Was he hit? The Sheriff believed that he was-the turnkey who had fired, that he was not! No one knew, at first, from whose lips the scream had fallen, but they were all soon to discover, with the most heart-rending sorrow. Rachael North was standing near the foot of the ladder, watching her husband mount and go over, and with her hands clasped in prayer for his safety. In her dark dress (for in Clayboro jail, night after night, she had not been in the habit of removing her clothes) no one saw her distinctly. She was just in the line below her perilled husband, and that fatally mis-aimed charge of buck-shot struck her full in the left side and back, literally tearing the heart that had been so agonized. Her sad watch was done-her earthly griefs were over-the omen of the night before was accomplished, in her and not in him. With that one wild scream of mortal agony she fell back at the feet of those struggling in the yard, her dark figure at last a prominent object on the stained and trodden snow-dead! 
               Hurried rapidly across the field to the back-street where the sleigh stood in waiting, with Thunder and Lightning chafing before it and Joe Harrison sitting within, enveloped in innumerable coats and blankets-hurried there and instantly dashed away over the snowy roads towards the sea-coast, with the sharp winter night wind on his cheek and the revived thought of freedom in his heart,-Barnard North little knew what had occurred in that last fatal moment of his escape. Nor, as he afterwards looked back once or twice to see the flames and smoke of his old prison rising thick and lurid on the darkness, could he have dreamed that it was almost forming a funeral pyre for the wife of his youth and the self-sacrificing companion of his late captivity. 
               No other life was lost in the struggle. All the shoremen escaped-many of them without knowing of the calamity which had occurred. One by one, their object accomplished and a pause in the conflict secured by the horrified exclamations which followed the shooting of Rachael North, they dropped over the wall and got away, scarcely one of them even identified. Among the last to leave and yet among the most totally unsuspected in their personality (is it not nearly always so, in desperate deeds?) were the four who might probably have been called the ringleaders in that desperate venture-Robbins, Radstock, Decker and Tom Collins. 
               The whole force of the town having at last been gathered by the continued ringing of the alarm-bells, and the rotten old planks and timber needing long drying before they could be burned, the flames were subdued before they reached the body of the Court-house, and there was only another black deformity added to the appearance of the hideous building. 
               The body of Rachael North was laid out, before daylight, in one of the rooms of Sheriff Parker, and an inquest was held over it at early morning. That inquest was a brief one, and it could have but one verdict: "Accidentally shot by a musket in the hands of Peter Brown, turnkey, while defending the jail against an organized assault and firing at an escaping criminal: and the jury acquit the said Peter Brown of any blame in the occurrence." Sympathetic Judge Nichols escaped for that day, the painful duty of sentencing to the State Prison a man whom he had gone beyond the strict line of his duty to save; but he found a sadder one in looking at the lifeless but noble form, and the features which retained their look of anxious love even in death, of the wife whose sacrifice had been the price paid for his temporary freedom. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXVIII. 
               DOWN TO THE COAST, BY THUNDER AND LIGHTNING. 
               IT was a good thing that Lettice Holloway had done, if any attempt was to be made at getting away Barnard North from the clutch of the law, in sending Joe Harrison with Thunder and Lightning to Clayboro. Steam was then in its infancy, no iron bands stretched like a chain net work over the breast of the whole prostrate world, and the telegraph was as yet unheard of. These agencies out of the way, with such a span and such a driver, her orders hurrying on the latter, and her image ever dancing before his eyes-any interception of the fugitive was simply impossible. 
               Away flew the sleigh, silently down the lanes leading eastward, until they struck the main road a mile or two beyond the county-town, after which time they had what one of Barnard North's nautical friends would have designated as "plain sailing." The night was without a moon, but cloudless and starlit, and the snowy roads of midwinter can never be dark. Fences, trees, houses flew by them in the dusky light. The winter wind bit sharply, but Harrison was well wrapped against it, and the tremor of his shaking nerves told less heavily, as we have seen, when his hands held whip and rein, than in any other occupation. Barnard North, spite of his more than three months of incarceration, was yet a tough and hardy man; and one of the shoremen's pea-jackets and a couple of horse-blankets, thoughtfully handed into the sleigh, furnished all the outer clothing necessary. Then there was that within the breast of the flying man-half triumph half despair-which would have defied even a fiercer cold than that of the February night. 
               But few words passed between the two men, for miles. Joe Harrison was busy with his horses and the occasional spots of snow-bank yet remaining in the road,-and Barnard North with his own thoughts and the late events which seemed to have fallen upon him as much without warning and as scathingly as fall the lightnings of heaven. Weeks-months-had gone by since he last breathed the free air, and what had occurred within that brief lapse of time! Twice had he stood before a jury of his countrymen-he, who had always before been so spotless in reputation and so popular among his fellow men-stood once on trial for his liberty and a second time for his life! He had shed human blood within that time-he, who had before saved so many and perilled none-shed that blood madly, under however intense provocation; and he felt that the blood was not only on that hand which he had held up in fierce bravado before his wife and Thomas Hillyer, but that it stained his forehead and rested upon his heart. Again-he who had coldly repulsed all offers of kindness and refused to accept any obligation, had that night been served as few men have ever been, and had accepted the service. For him and in his behalf more than a score of men had outlawed themselves, and the thought of the true hearts who had battled for him somewhat thawed the ice around his brain. He had been mad: he was yet partially beside himself with the shame and bitterness of his mingled wrongs and errors; but he was nearer human once more during the few hours immediately succeeding the escape from Clayboro Jail, than he had been for many a long day. 
               Two or three times, as has been said, the Wrecker glanced round and backward, as they swept away from the town, and saw the flames from the burning sheds and the dull smoke rolling heavily away to leeward. Perhaps he had a thought of joy, at such moments, that the place of his torment would soon be ashes-the cell where he had grovelled, the Court-room where he had been arraigned: but within the space of a few miles the tall pines that skirted the road hid all behind from his view, and he sank back in silence into the corner of the sleigh-silent as the frosty air that bit his cheek-perhaps almost as cold! 
               Long before daylight the road began to grow familiar to the Wrecker, seldom as he had been in the habit of travelling to any distance from his place of residence. The sound of the surf began to be heard between the gusts of the night-wind. A damp, salt air began to come in fitfully to brow and nostril. They were nearing the sea-shore, then he knew-and he drew in long draughts of that air from which he had been so many weeks debarred. Draughts the longing for which only those know who have been born where the grand old sea sang lullabys beside the cradle and the pillow-where the flash of its waves gave a brighter glory to the morning light through all the long days of childhood. Draughts, the very thought of which, to the man of the coast shut away in the far inland, combines that swelling in the throat of the Swiss or the Tyrolean, when he thinks of the mountains and the "Ranz des Vaches," with that yearning to go back which brings tears to the eyes of the Scot when the bagpipes play "Lochaber" or "Auld Lang Syne." 
                      
                        "Scent to match thy rich perfume 
                        Chinese art did ne'er presume: 
                        Roses, violets, hut toys 
                        For the smaller sort of boys 
                        Or for greener damsels meant: 
                        Thou'rt the only manly scent!" 
                     
                   Sings Charles Lamb in his touchingly-quaint "Farewell to Tobacco;" but had Elia been nurtured beside the sea and then for a time condemned to breathe where never salt-water flashed and never sea-breeze blew, how different and how dearer to ten thousand memories would have been the apostrophe! It is thou, glorious old sea, our mother!-who singest the songs sweetest and most soothing to the fevered pulses of humanity!-thou who pressest most cooling kisses upon our hot brows when we suffer and are weak!-thou who bringest us even nearer to heaven than the eternal mountains can lift by beckoning us over thy boundless waves to the Infinite! 
               It was not yet broad day when Joe Harrison's smoking horses dashed up in front of the little hut-tavern with its pitch-and-white-wash sign, the "Coaster's Retreat," at Bush Inlet. No one was yet astir; but Harrison, who could not have retained so much of the man about him for any other purpose as for such an adventure-sprang instantly from the sleigh and knocked heavily with the butt of his whip at the door of the little groggery. A few tedious minutes, during which the remaining figure in the sleigh never stirred from its crouching position,-brought a grumble and a curse or two from within-then a heavy foot on the floor and the unbaring of the door. 
                
               "Well-what in the devil's name do you want at this time o'night?" was the rough salutation, as Phil Hazlett, landlord of the "Coaster's Retreat" thrust his dingy-shirted shoulders and half-bushel of uncombed head out at the opening. 
               "Call this 'night'?-I should think it was well along in the morning!" was the reply of Harrison. "Come out of that, Phil Hazlett, and don't joke! You're wanted!" 
               "Who the deuce are you? Oh, I see-Joe Harrison! I might ha' knowed the hosses!" So he might, and might have known their owner as well, when he could see him fairly, as the latter, no longer ashamed of company that he would once have held in utter contempt, had often made that doubtful locality a rendezvous with some of the wild companions who were hurrying him downward to deeper ruin, for orgies a little too rapid for the more thickly-settled sections. 
               "What the deuce are you doing here?-and who have you got in the sleigh?" Hazlett added, pointing to the figure which had not yet moved, and the face of which was entirely concealed in a slouched hat lent during the escape, and in two enveloping horse-blankets. 
               "Barnard North," answered Joe Harrison, speaking close to the landlord's ear. "He has been pretty near sentenced to State Prison since dark; and we have just took him out and set fire to the old jail so as to see to get away-that's all!" 
               "The devil you have!" was the rough but natural comment of Hazlett. "And so that's Barney! Hooray for old times! I must go and speak to him-jest a minute." 
               "Get on your clothes first, and be quick!" said Harrison. "I've just come down here from Clayboro a good deal faster than any other team in Seaboard County could ha' done it-you know Thunder and Lightning haven't been catched, yet!-but there's no time to be lost. Some of them may be after him in half an hour. Uncle Zeke Robbins and Decker told me to get him here as quick as I could, and ask you if there was any boat down the Inlet. He said you'd know the rest." 
               "So I do, ef there's any man does!" was the self-complacent reply of Hazlett, who thereupon disappeared for a moment and returned with enough clothes about him, such as they were and considering the manner of their putting on. Joe Harrison had meanwhile gone back to the sleigh, and the moment after he was joined there by the groggery-keeper, between whom and the Wrecker passed a few words of congratulation. Then Hazlett jumped into the vehicle and told Harrison to drive on eastward. 
               "Shove them ponies of your'n along down to the P'int, about as fast as they know how to go," he said. "We must see what can be done, and see pretty quick!" The sleigh was fairly in motion by this time, over a half broken road down the south shore of the Inlet, towards the open sea; and the landlord went on talking as they rode. "On'y one boat here, but one's enough if we catch her jest in time. They was tryin' to get the 'Susan' out last night, but the ice was a little too thick for 'em. Ef the tide has lifted enough this mornin', there's no knowin'. She's goin' down to Wilmington on charter, for naval stores, and that'd be just the mackerel! Well, hurry along them horses, and we'll see!" 
               Little more was spoken; and at rapid speed for the wet, icy and execrable road, the sleigh made its way for another mile down the Inlet. The heavy beat of the waves on the shore was now plainly perceptible; and rising a little knoll on which stood two or three squalid fishing-houses, they came in sight of Upper Topsail Point, or Bush village, a hamlet of a dozen or two habitations not more pretentious, beyond which, and stretching out seaward ran a long sandy point, studded half way to its extremity with a tall white-washed stone light-house. Inside the point lay a large fore-and-aft schooner, and several men were observed to be busy on her deck, while the ice around her was much broken and the tide that was coming in over the bar sent it whirling and crashing about with even troublesome velocity. 
               "Hooray!" cried Hazlett as he caught sight of the schooner. "It's all right!-she's there yet, and the spring tide is knock-in' that there ice into oven wood! We hain't got a minute to spare, though! Now, Barney North, ef you on'y can get aboard of her, they'll have a starn chase, and a mighty long one of it!" 
               The Wrecker grasped the rough hand of Hazlett in his own still harder palm, and shook it with a gratitude which his brother freemason of the shore well understood; but his lips syllabled no word. The snow was nearly all blown away or melted, so near as they were to the open beach; but not all the mettle of Thunder and Lightning had yet been exhausted, and it was at no contemptible speed that they drew the heavy conveyance down to the very edge of the sandy point. 
               There were two or three boats lying on the sand, and the united efforts of the three soon dragged one of them to the edge of the shore-ice. Then, with a shake of the hand with Barnard North and a hurried good-bye, the poor fellow went back to his horses and piled blankets upon their smoking loins as if he could never do enough to compensate them for the long and terrible labor they had just performed-performed, not for himself-no!-not for Barnard North and benevolence-no!-but because he believed that he was fulfilling what had been or would have been the behest of Lettice Holloway, and that the act might bring him nearer-what matter if never so little nearer to her!
                
               He saw, as he stood blanketing his horses, that the Wrecker and Hazlett managed to get their boat away from the shore-ice and into the "porridge" beyond. As the "Susan" was running up her main peak and the head of her jib, they succeeded in working through the floe so as to near her and be discovered. A rope was thrown, and the little boat was warped up to the side of the schooner. 
               It needed no words of explanation to Duff, the captain of the "Susan," to make him acquainted with the service desired of him-when he saw the tall form of Barnard North-as well known to every sailor and shoreman on the coast as was Topsail light-house itself,-rise out of the boat at the side of his schooner. But few more were necessary to make him acquainted with what had so lately occurred, and he gave a sailor's grasp to the hand of the fugitive. 
               "There ain't a man on the shore, or off it, that doesn't know you've been hardly used, Barney North," he said; "and there isn't one, worth calling a man, that wouldn't rather help you out of the teeth of them lawyer chaps and other land-sharks than eat soft-crab for breakfast. You'll be safe enough down in the Car'linas, and the old 'Susan' 'll put you there, once we get out of this ice, a little quicker'n anything else that carries rags!" 
               A boast, by the way, not the less hearty because the "Susan" was well known to be one of the very slowest of the coasting fleet-so well known that Duff was currently accused, among the shore-wags, of sailing up and down the beach without any errand whatever, just to see whether he could not find one boat that he could beat, once! But then whoever knew of the man who owned the slow boat, or the slow horse, or the watch that did not keep the most fautless time? Captain Duff was doing what he believed to be a creditable and benevolent action; who could have the heart to deny him his harmless little boast? 
               If Barnard North had been cruelly outraged by one portion of humanity, until his heart turned to stone and his brain maddened, was there not enough in the devoted and uncalculating kindness so many times already shown him by the shoremen among whom his life had been passed, to soften again the heart and cool again the brain? Perhaps the Wrecker thought so, as he stood once more a free man on the deck of the staunch schooner, and remembered how lately he had been the inmate of a jail and how nearly a more loathsome and disgraceful prison had opened and closed its iron doors upon him! But it is a sad truth for humanity that wrongs and injuries live long in the memory, while kindnesses and even sacrifices are soon forgotten. 
               Half an hour after the events just recorded, the "Susan," with Barnard North on board, had cleared the ice at the mouth of the Inlet, passed the bar, and was standing down the beach with that "race-horse speed" which made her the pride of her Captain; while Hazlett had managed to shove his boat back again through the ice to the shore, and Joe Harrison's peerless blacks, worse beaten out than they had ever before been since foaled, were drawing the two men leisurely back to Bush Inlet, where food and rest, of some rough sort or other, awaited men and animals. 
               Four days later, the good schooner "Susan" was off the coast of North Carolina and the bar at the entrance to the harbor of Wilmington-then, as for many years after, one of the leading ports for the shipment of naval-stores to the North, and little expected ever to become one side of a blockade-running ferry from Nassau, in defiance of the American Flag! Barnard North had been comparatively cheerful during the voyage, under the sympathetic and well-considered treatment of Captain Duff and his crew, and had insisted on performing some part of the seaman-duty to which he was by no means a stranger, though the memory of his exile from home could not have done otherwise than oppress him and render him much of the time silent if not gloomy. 
               A few additional hours brought the "Susan" to one of the wharves of the dingy and squalid little city, where she was to load with naval-stores for a northern port. The sights and sounds and climate of the Carolinas were alike a novelty to the exiled man; and for a time-especially while the picturesque and jabbering negroes were rolling the casks of pitch, rosin and turpentine down the miserable docks to load the vessel,-he seemed to have shaken off much of the heaviness that had of late oppressed him, and messed, as Duff remarked, "as if he'd been dietin' a month, and just came to his feed!" 
               But the schooner was soon loaded and once more to spread her white wings for the voyage northward. It was not safe for the Wrecker to go back with her, nor could he live without employment in that distant State and among strangers. A happy suggestion of Captain Duff, that the fishermen of Oak Island would be glad of his company and give an old hand like him, when they came to know him, a capital lay,-supplied at once the needed occupation and the means of livelihood. Twenty-four hours after, when the "Susan" left Wilmington and dropped away down Cape Fear River for the homeward run-saw Barnard North an inmate of one of the little fishing-houses on the south side of Oak Island, hand-and-glove with the bluff and hearty fishermen, and laying his giant strength once more to the oar and the heavy hauling of the drop-net, as if the occurrences of the past few months had been only a feverish dream. Ah, that blackest of all the black shadows lying behind him-the death of Rachael North-he knew nothing of it. Thank heaven, sometimes, for the impossibility of annihilating time and space!-for long enduring ignorance when eventual knowledge is to bring distraction! 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIX. 
               HOWLAND DENNISTON AND SON. 
               FOR a considerable time past the course of this narration, except as they were incidently alluded to in connection with the imprisonment and escape of the Wrecker of Topsail,-has necessarily wandered away from Charley Denniston and Lettice Holloway, two persons who are certainly entitled to receive other treatment than neglect, from both writer and reader. It may convey something like the same satisfaction which glorious old Charles Lamb, so lately quoted, gave to the Clerk of the India House when he promised to atone for coming late to his duties in the morning, by going away early in the afternoon,-to say that if there has for a time been a dearth of those young people, there is now likely to be a plethora of them-that their fortunes must now be followed, for a certain period, to the exclusion of all others' who do not happen to move in their immediate circle. 
               It will be remembered that Martin Hawkins, Insurance Agent, when parting in anger with Charley Denniston, outside the office of Squire Holloway, threatened the young man with communicating to his father some unpleasant hints of his career among the people on the sea-coast, if he did not immediately flee temptation, return to the city, and place himself under the eye of the old underwriter. It will also be remembered that Charley Denniston, hot in the blood of youth, met that threat with another, that if the Agent meddled himself with his business in the direction suggested, he would make any employment by the Board of Underwriters somewhat too warm for one Martin Hawkins! 
               One of these threats was carried out at an early day, whatever was to be the fate of the other. Young Denniston did not return to town within the time named by the irascible Agent; and the consequence of that default was the introduction of his name into the very next conversation held between Hawkins and the elder Denniston, with a somewhat highly-colored picture of the conduct of the junior while at Topsail-his taking the part of the shoremen in the proceedings commenced against them-his intimacy with Squire Holloway (whom the Agent painted as a better sort of beach-pirate, principally engaged in sheltering the more active members of his tribe from punishment for their crimes)-the possession by the Squire, of "one fair daughter," ambitious and presuming as she was handsome, and the Circe of the whole country-side-and the strong probability that the unscrupulous young lady had been setting her traps, and baiting them with smiles and perhaps with kisses, for the son of the rich merchant from the city. It might have been a little strange how Hawkins should have known all this, and would have been so, to any one not conversant with the fact that during that very visit to Topsail the Agent had been favored with a second interview with Major Jeff Taddlewick and admitted into all the real or supposed weaknesses of the entire neighborhood, the most unfavorably painted persons of all being the Squire and his daughter, because the Major had not quite been able to force his family into recognition as their equals in the three-storied society of the village. The Major it was who had strengthened the previous unfavorable opinion of the Squire held by Hawkins: and he it was who had made him aware of the danger lurking in the syren smiles and deceptive disposition of the daughter. And if the Agent, in his conversation with Mr. Howland Denniston, added a little coloring to the picture on his own account, had he not indeed been signally enough ill-used in and about the county of Seaboard, to make a little wrath and vituperation almost excusable? 
               This conversation between the Agent and his principal employer took place in October, while the son was still absent from the city; and it is not too much to say that the circumstances and the suspicions communicated by Hawkins caused the good old merchant decided anxiety. But he was one of the kindest of fathers as well as one of the truest of business men, and he seldom sprang precipitately at any conclusion involving matters of consequence. He had been too far-seeing to wish to shut up his son from intercourse with the outer world, in fear that he might derive ill instead of good from familiarity with it: he was too wise to believe, on slight allegation, that that son, all whose actions had so far been peculiarly straight forward and honorable, could have allowed himself, within that brief period, to be drawn into unworthy associations. The statement may seem incredible, but it is true: there are men in the world, however rare, who do not habitually display disrespect for their own blood by putting the worst construction upon every action prompted by that blood! There are,-rare as these, too, may be-fathers (ay, and mothers) who think of their children as younger companions, not serfs or bond-slaves,-who treat them confidently as well as confidentially and "spare the [moral] rod" when there seems to be no occasion for using it, even at the risk of "spoiling the child" [for all those useful purposes to which human cast-iron and adamant may be afterwards applied.] 
               Howland Denniston, merchant and underwriter, so thinking, though at the first moment he really intended to call his son to an account and demand of him an explanation of any position he might hold towards the Holloways, before he saw his son thought better (or worse) of it, and said nothing whatever on the subject. He saw that the young man, when in town, demeaned himself with all propriety-that his face seemed as open and honest as handsome (oh, how handsome he was, to that doting father's eyes!)-that he gave no indication of having fallen into evil company or bad practices. Confidently, perhaps blindly, he trusted him-trusted him, without either catechism or diligent enquiry. 
               Howland Denniston may have known the story of the two budding agriculturalists, one of whom planted his potatoes in the usual manner and left them to grow, while the other dug them up every day to see how they were getting on; and he may have heeded the warning conveyed. At all events, he said nothing to his son of the atrocities laid to his charge. Occasionally the young man, not yet ready to enter into business, during the weeks following the arrest of the Wrecker and his first trial, was absent from the city, unquestioned by the man who of all others had the best right to question him. It was not the father's privilege, just then to know of his whereabouts during those absences; it is ours, at this period, to know beyond a peradventure. Joe Harrison was incorrect, besides being inexcusably vulgar, when he told Uncle Zeke Robbins, at Clayboro, at February term, that "that rich New York chap had been hangin' around the Eagle, off and on, all winter;" but he certainly, between October and February, had been transiently accommodated at that hostel more frequently than he could very well explain on the score of business; and quite as certainly he had not lost his first foothold at Squire Holloway's, but eaten enough dinners and suppers there (without "caponed snipe") to benefit the hotel larder and make notable inroads upon that presided over by curly-headed and mischievous little Letty. As before hinted, he, in conjunction with the Squire, had been among the pecuniary backers of the prosecuted Wrecker, at both trials; and it is not certain that the necessity of being so had not furnished excuse (to himself at least) for more than one visit to Topsail and more than one call at the bulls-eyed door or the office where the Squire and Rod dispensed undignified justice. How he had prospered in his wooing of the high-priestess of calicoes and curds, or whether he had wooed at all, remains to be seen at a very early period in this connection. 
               But there was to be an end to the unquestioning patience and confidence of Howland Denniston, as there is to all other mundane things except a finger-ring and the revolving circle of the seasons. Winter was done, the conviction and escape of Barnard North had been known and commented upon in country and city, and March, more than half expired, was bringing the verge of another equinox,-when a circumstance apparently fortuitous brought on the long-deferred question and explanation. 
               The underwriter was sitting at the table in his little room, at his residence on Broadway, fronting the Bowling Green (city wealth and luxury then resided nearer the Battery than they do at this day to the Central Park)-one morning of that March, examining some papers which he had just taken from a huge iron chest in one corner of the neatly-furnished apartment,-when his son hurriedly opened the door, stepped within, saw the busy occupant, bowed, said "Good morning, father!" in a tone as pleasant as his face, and was about to close the door again and retire, when the voice of the elder recalled him: 
               "Stop, my son-come back: you need not be in such a hurry." 
               "I do not wish to disturb you," answered the son, still holding the door in his hand. "I merely stepped in to scribble a note, but as you are busy here I will do it in my own room." 
               "No-come in," said the merchant, laying down the papers that he had held in his hand; and the son obeyed. 
               The March day was raw and chilly, and a cosy little wood-fire flashed and sparkled in the Franklin stove, throwing a pleasanter light than that which came in at the windows from the cold, clouded sky, on the dark carpet; the baized table and heavy oaken chairs, with the big iron chest open-lidded, a well-filled book-case, and on the walls two or three choice oil-paintings which Howland Denniston had long before brought home from over sea-forming a charming background. The father drew round his chair from the table, so as to throw his stretched-out limbs before the genial glow of the fire and motioned his son to draw another chair into the same comfortable proximity, a motion which he at once obeyed. Seated thus and for the moment silent, father and son, each a feature on which the eye could dwell with content, formed a picture worth remembering. It is to be regretted, of course, that we have not the opportunity of presenting a harsh-featured old miserly ignoramus on one side of the fire, throwing the cherubic young gentleman (his son) into bolder relief on the other; and for the effectiveness of this narration it is so much more desirable that we should be able to depict a family quarrel of the stereotype drama and romance order, in which the father threatens the son with a big stick and bigger words, calling him an "infernal young jackanapes" and a "miserable puppy whom he'll bedashed if he doesn't disinherit and leave to starve;" while the son duly defies the parent, taunts him with the villainous act of siring him to lord over and crush afterwards, and proclaims his intention of "leaving him forever, on the instant," and "working, begging, starving, rather than touch another penny of his accursed gold." All this-wo for writer and reader!-may not be in the present instance: the very uninteresting anomaly is here presented of a father and a son who were not deadly enemies! 
               We have before been privileged to see the warm hazel eyes, the curling brown hair, rounded and almost beardless face, and fast-developing form of Charley Denniston; and he has more than once been called undeniably handsome. And yet it is doubtful whether many a true woman might not that day have been found, herself scarcely past girlhood, and yet disposed to think the tall and just a little portly gentleman, yet on the sunny side of fifty, with his once brown hair heavily iron-grayed, (as if to match his garments of dark steel-mixed broadcloth) his side-whiskers almost white, and the crows'-feet of time and care plainly marked under the eyes and taking away from the smoothness of his well-cut features-but with the mouth genial without weakness and the brown eye clear and sunny as ever,-it is doubtful whether many a far-seeing woman, not yet at her own maturity, could not have been found, disposed to call the father still handsomer than his son, if she would not even have been quite as willing to build around him the hopes of a life! 
               "Well Charley, my boy!" said the under-writer, when his son had obeyed him and drawn a chair towards the fire. "How are you getting on with your jolly dog's life of idleness? Almost ready to think of going to work?" 
               "Yes-quite ready, whenever you think best!" was the reply. 
               "Humph! that is well!" said the father. "By the way, I had something to say to you-have had something for a long time past, and have been too busy to say it, even if you had not been away too much of the time to give me the opportunity." 
               The clear, transparent cheek of the young man reddened slightly, though that may have been the effect of the firelight-as he answered. 
               "I am sorry, sir, if I have been away when you wished me here." 
               "Oh, nothing of consequence," said the merchant-"still-. By the way, Charley," glancing at the handsome dark travelling-suit of his son," you seem to be dressed for going away again!" 
               "Yes, sir, I am going away from town to-day, for a day or two-that is, if you have no special reason for wishing me to remain." This after a hesitation so slight that it could scarcely be noted. 
               "Where are you going?-may I ask?" 
               "Certainly, father! I am going down into-into Seaboard County." This, especially the latter portion, with a hesitation much more easily discernible. 
               "To Topsail?" asked the father, some-what quickly. 
               There was no doubt whatever, and no possibility that the firelight could have caused it-about the flush that crept to cheek and brow of Charley Denniston, at this question which showed him at once that his late penchant for that locality had been noticed and remarked upon, whether by friendly or unfriendly tongues-that his father knew or suspected something of the cause of his visits there. 
               "Yes, sir, I was going down to Topsail," he replied after another very brief period of hesitation. 
               If on the face of the young man, at that moment, there was a flush-on that of the elder there was an unmistakable look of anxiety. Perhaps neither, each wrapped in his own thoughts, saw what was betrayed by the other. 
               "Humph!" The voice of the underwriter was lower and more earnest than it had been at first, and before he spoke further he once or twice uneasily shifted the legs that were crossed before the fire. "Humph!-my son, this brings up the very subject about which I sometime ago intended to speak to you, though I have deferred it because I was very busy, because you were absent at such times as I might have found leisure, and because, as you know, I have had and always hoped to have great confidence in you." 
               The two were not sitting far apart: the son reached over and grasped the father's hand with a pressure that was cordially returned. 
               "I hope never to forfeit the confidence with which you honor me!" he said. 
               "I never expect you to forfeit it, Charley, my dear boy!" replied Howland Denniston. "And that there may not be any breach in that confidence, let us talk plainly. You are no longer a boy, but a man, and it is to the man-my companion and friend as well as my son,-to whom I am now speaking. Why are you going down to Topsail again; and why have you been there so often before, since you went down with Mr. Hawkins on a mere journey of observation, last fall?" 
               If Charley Denniston's face had before been first slightly flushed, then red, it was now scarlet. He felt, no doubt, that a great crisis in his life was reached and to be passed; and he tried to speak, but the words seemed to die away in his throat without breath. He only managed to utter disconnectedly: 
               "Father-I-" 
               "Humph!" again said the underwriter, who had in this instance been closely scanning the face of his son. "I find that there 
                  is something in that story, and I am sorry to see it!" 
               "May I ask what story it is, to which you refer?" The words came more easily, now, for there was just a little feeling-not to say anger-mingling with the previous confusion. 
               "The story, my son, that Mr. Hawkins told me when he first returned from Topsail after you went down with him to the wreck of the America." 
               "Mr. Hawkins. father?-Then I can well imagine-. Will you be kind enough to tell me what was Mr. Hawkins' story?" 
               "Ah, Charles! Then you had reason to believe that Mr. Hawkins would tell me something?" The voice of Mr. Denniston was very much troubled, now, and his face not less so. "Charles," too,-not "Charley," or "my son," as before! "What can you 'well imagine'?-and why?" 
               "Because Mr. Hawkins and myself had some unpleasant words before we left Topsail at that time, and he threatened-" 
               "To tell me everything that had occurred? So he did!-so he had a right to do, had he not? If your actions there and at that time were strictly correct, his 'threatening,' as you call it, could have had no terrors-" 
               "'Terrors,' father? In speaking of something between you and myself, have you not used a word which you did not intend?" There was plainly hurt feeling in the young man's question. The father felt it and at once acknowledged the mistake. 
               "Certainly, Charles, I did use a wrong word. I mean that if your whole action had been exactly proper, you could have had no objection to my hearing of it; and if it had not been, you must recognise the right of Mr. Hawkins, under whose charge, to some extent, you went down to the coast, to make me acquainted with the facts." 
               "Certainly-that is-provided Mr. Hawkins told the story precisely as it was, and without prejudice?" 
               "Heydey, young man! I have known Mr. Hawkins for more than a dozen years, and done business with him through all that time; and you are the first whom I have ever heard impugn his truth, even by insinuation! Do you accuse him of falsehood, Charles? Think twice before you answer." 
               Charley Denniston did think twice before he answered. He rose from his chair and walked twice up and down the room before he uttered another word. 
               "Mr. Hawkins, father, is a man of ungovernable temper and violent prejudices. I saw him begin at the wrong end with those people, of whose disposition and character he seems to understand nothing. I saw him ill-treated and outraged by them in return; and I saw him reach such a state of anger and revengeful feeling that he was almost entirely beside himself and unfit for the business in which he was engaged!" 
               "What do you say, Charles Denniston?" The old merchant, too, had risen from his seat, started up by a blank surprise, mingled with doubt, which seemed to have fallen upon him. 
               "I say, father," the young man went on, "what I intended never to say, because I am not a member of the Board of Underwriters and have really no right to meddle in their business,-but that Mr. Hawkins, in making statements about me and my doings, has removed any obligation of silence. I say that Martin Hawkins, in arresting Barnard North and forcing him to prison on a mere shadow of suspicion, was going beyond his duty, out of revenge for a violence that he had himself first provoked,-and that I should not like to be as nearly responsible for both the deaths at the county-town which have lately made so much noise in the public papers, as well as for the ruin and exile of a brave and noble man like Barnard North, as is that same Martin Hawkins, however blindly he may have gone on, believing that he was only doing his duty!" 
               "Why, my son, you astonish me!" said the underwriter, whose breath seemed partially taken away by the vehemence and yet the evident truth of his son's words. 
               "I meant to astonish you, father, if ever I did speak at all on the subject!" answered Charley Denniston, with something very like exultation in his tone. And the young fellow had even more cause for exultation than he knew; for the sharpest lawyer, much less a young fledgling of the schools, could not have devised, with his keenest wit, so effectual a mode of removing the worst impressions made upon the mind of the old merchant by Hawkins' story, and placing the present relator at an advantage over him with reference to the whole adventure at Topsail,-as that of exposing the Agent's ill-temper, hardness and spirit of persecution. 
               "And now, then, that I have carried out my threat as well as he his," the young man went on, still walking the floor and by no means at quiet, will you be kind enough, father, to tell me what Mr. Hawkins represented of my conduct down at the sea-coast?" 
               "Nothing dishonorable-only weak," answered the merchant. "But, come, Charley-sit down again! We have no reason to be excited and walk the floor, that I know of!" 
               Both fell back into their sitting positions before the fire, and Howland Denniston continued: 
               "Mr. Hawkins informed me-this is the gist of the whole affair-that one Squire Holloway, a magistrate at Topsail, but really an ally and aid of the beach-pirates, had a handsome, bold and unscrupulous hoyden of a daughter, if nothing worse, with whom you seemed to be smitten, and that both father and daughter were trying to make what they believed to be a 'good catch' out of you; while you were silly enough-. There, don't bounce up again in that manner, boy!" 
               But Charley Denniston did "bounce up-" had bounced up before the words were well out of the old merchant's mouth; and there was much more dangerous fire apparent in him than the father had ever before seen, as he broke out: 
               "Martin Hawkins lies! I am sorry to be obliged to use such words in your presence, father; but that man is either a miserable falsifier, who deserves to be taken by the throat and choked, or an equally miserable fool, not fit to be entrusted with any interest beyond the value of a sixpence." 
               "Heydey!" and the underwriter was up again, too-nearly as much excited as his son, if not as angry. "Are you mad, young man? Is this story of your being bewitched, true after all?" 
               "No, I am not mad, and I am not be-witched!" replied the young man. "Father, listen to me, for the whole truth may as well be told while we are speaking. I meant to tell you when I had a right to do so, but now as well as ever. The people whom Martin Hawkins would befoul, for his own purposes or because they have been belied to him, are among the best and truest that God's hand ever made. I know them-young as you think me-as I am: he does not-that is, for his soul's sake I hope that he does not! William Holloway is a strange man, perhaps, but a true gentleman, a peacemaker for the whole country around him, and one of the most thoroughly just men living; and--" 
               "And his daughter?" asked Howland Denniston, with a strange expression on his face, that his excited son had no power to decipher. 
               "His daughter is as strange as her father, but modest as she is virtuous! I would stake my life upon her truth, anywhere and in any manner. And the man who wins her, will win one of the brightest jewels ever set by the Almighty Hand in the crown of womanhood!" 
               "Young man-do you intend to win her?" asked the father, severely. 
               "I win her?-I?-" and Charley Denniston indubitably stammered. Such crises in life are not easy to get over, however glibly the romancers may depict them! 
               "Because, by the Lord who made me!" continued the underwriter, with an almost thundering vehemence in his tone, "if you, my only son, dare use one dishonorable art towards that girl, whether she be what you believe her or what Martin Hawkins calls her, I will forget that you ever bore my blood-I will hunt you as I would a thief to the State Prison! Do you hear me?" 
               "Yes, I hear you, and as you are my father I can forgive you the momentary suspicion," answered the young man, every nerve trembling, and yet as fully resolved upon what he felt must be a desperate deed, as ever was soldier when he set foot in the breach with the forlorn hope. "You need not fear dishonor-father! If I can win Lettice Holloway, mind-I say if I can win her, for I do not know-she shall be my wife, and my only wife, if I am obliged to wait twenty years for your consent to marry her!" 
               Red, white, almost green, by turns, stood Howland Denniston, the moment after the delivery of his son's ultimatum. Both hands were clasped to the sides of his head, as if the brain could not contain the thoughts laboring within it. There must indeed have been a struggle going on in heart and brain, worthy of record even beside the agony of the elder Brutus, or the sickness at the heart of William Tell. How he loved his son, must already have been faintly conveyed from the mind of the writer to that of every parent who reads: how proud he was of him, his goodness, his manly beauty, who but God and himself could know: how much he, the rich and honored merchant, had built upon the hope of seeing him mated with one of the proudest daughters of the proud Empire City-a daughter of that old patrician mercantile blood which he himself boasted, and bringing her hundreds of thousands to make surer yet the commercial position which he had power to give,-how much he had built upon this, who can hope to realize, that has not stood in some corresponding position and seen the turrets of the airy castle flash yet brighter at the moment when they were beginning to melt hopelessly and forever into thin air! 
               Something of what was expressed in that face Charley Denniston saw: something that must naturally be expressed there at such a crisis, perhaps he had known in advance. It is only truth to say that he was frightened at what he saw-that all the son came up in his nature, and for the moment put away all the lover. He almost crept to his father's side, took down one of his hands and held it in both his own, as he said, brokenly and half in tears: 
               "Forgive me, father! If what I have said gives you so much pain, I will recall it-every word!" 
               "And be false to yourself? No, boy!-terribly as you have shocked me for the moment, in the breaking up of half the hopes of a life, you can never recall the words you have spoken, nor shall I ask you to change them if you can only satisfy me that your attachment is worthily placed-that there is that in it which is calculated to make you personally happy!" 
               The struggle had been a hard one, but it had terminated very quickly, and terminated in a result not likely to have been reached, under the same circumstances, by many men besides Howland Denniston. 
               "Oh, father!" and in an instant the son was on one knee, which he had never expected to bend again to any except God and the lady of his love-kissing the hand of that parent whom he so loved and who loved him so dearly. He was melted-broken-altogether subdued. He could have died, at that moment, for that noblest of men, and thought it joy to go to the scaffold at his command. At least he thought that he could do so, and there was no occasion to test the idea more closely. 
               "Stop, my son-rise!" said the father, and Charley Denniston at once rose to his feet, a little chilled by something which he saw in his father's face. "I do not wish to cause misery, or even suspense, Charley, and whether wisely or unwisely your choice has been made, you have proved to me, in word and action which I cannot misunderstand, that it has been made beyond recall. So I give my consent to your marriage, when you win the girl herself-blindly, and without ever seeing her whom I am to recognise as my daughter; but I do so on one condition, and unless that condition is fulfilled, I say to you here and now, that as God sees me I will never recognise her or you if you persist!" 
               "And that condition?-father-what is it that you can possibly mean?" asked the son, awed now even more than chilled. "Lettice Holloway is not wealthy, though her father-" 
               "Hush!" said the merchant, somewhat sternly. "Do not name wealth, from such a quarter and in connection with mine! You might have formed an alliance in this city, possibly, in which your heart would have been engaged and wealth equal to our own added to what we have already accumulated. Let that pass-it is not to be so! Wealth anything less than that, is not worth the adding; and no doubt we have enough for ourselves and for all heaven's purposes with us. No-I do not ask that your wife should be wealthy. I have your word that she is handsome, and a natural lady, and that she is good and pure. All these things you should know-can know; and I believe and trust your assurance. But there is one thing that you cannot yet know, and all doubt must be cleared away, or Lettice Holloway-do you not call her so?-shall never enter my house as my daughter! I make but one condition-see, I have yielded up everything else, no matter at what cost: will you promise me that you will see that one condition fulfilled, or that you will abandon this girl and think of her no more?" 
               "Father-is that condition a possible one?" asked the young man, a strange doubt and wonder for the moment in his face. 
               "Perfectly possible-a little difficult, perhaps; but one made entirely for your eventual happiness, my son." 
               "Then I promise it, as before heaven itself!" was the reply. 
               "You love this girl with your whole heart?" 
               "Yes!" 
               "You believe that this passion is to endure as long as your life?" 
               "Yes-I am certain of it! Yes!" 
               "You believe that Lettice Holloway loves you?" 
               "I have never yet asked her, but I have seen enough to convince me that she does-yes, I have no doubt of it." 
               "And yet you need to know before you marry her. How can you ascertain beyond doubt?" 
               "By her own words! She is truthful as heaven-transparent as the day itself." 
               "Perhaps, and if she knows herself! For your sake I hope that she may be found so. But did you ever think, my dear boy, of the difficulty of a young man in your position learning whether he is loved or not? All know you as the son of a wealthy merchant-this girl knows you to be so-what chance to ascertain how much of the devotion is paid to the man and how much to the wealth?" 
               "You think this possible of Lettice Holloway?" 
               "My son, I have not even seen her-remember! But I make it an unswerving stipulation in your marrying her, that before you do so you shall convince yourself by proof beyond the power of mistake, that she would marry you just as soon and just as gladly, in poverty as in all your wealth. Now you know my condition, and my only one." 
               What moved the underwriter to this strange and poignant anxiety? Who shall say? Desire for the permanent happiness of his son, and this one point thought of to the exclusion of all others? It can scarcely have been so, in any human probability. No-for Howland Denniston, successful merchant and honored man in every relation of life, in the long past there must have been a skeleton in the domestic closet,-there must have been a knowledge, obtained through sad experience, how easily wealth can blind the eyes and buy the body, but how impossible, when the gloss is worn away and the glamour dissipated, that it can bind hearts for time and wed souls for eternity! 
               "Yes, father, I know your one condition, now, but I do not understand why it is made, much better than before!" said the son, a little shade of trouble on his winning face, but that face marvellously brightened from what it had been when something worse was dimly anticipated. 
               "You do not see why? For your own happiness, my boy!" answered the father. 
               "Well-no matter for the reason," the young man proceeded. "I have promised, and it only remains for me to keep my promise. That she is true and not mercenary-that she would marry me without a dollar, if she would do so at all-I know as well as I know my own existence. But how to prove it? Say, father!" and the face brightened still more at the thought, so easily suggested by books and plays read and witnessed-"couldn't you lose all your property, temporarily, and make me a beggar?" 
               "That plan is old, and would never do," said the underwriter, in a tone not less cheerful. "Nobody would believe the story of my sudden ruin, I am proud to say! No-my son: yours is the stake-a heavy one, if the girl is worth half what you think; and you must play for it with your own brain. You have my promise, and I have yours. God bless you, my boy! And now I must go to business, though perhaps I have been doing one of the most important pieces of business of my life, here, this morning. You were going down to Topsail-go, and good bye!" 
               "Good bye, father! I will bring you the proof you ask-or make the sacrifice you require-my noble, generous, good, darling old father!" 
               And so that strangely matched father and son shook hands warmly and separated-the underwriter to his business, and Charley Denniston once more to the sea coast and what he unhesitatingly believed to be his! But it may be said, here, that a part of the old merchant's business, that day, was to institute an investigation into the management of affairs on the coast, which eventually cost Martin Hawkins, valued Agent as he was, his connection with the Board of Underwriters-so dangerous is it to take any liberties with the young lion unless the teeth of the old one are first extracted! 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXX. 
               THE INFLUENCE OF A DEAD MOTHER. 
               ONCE more in Seaboard, after an absence that, while it had really covered only two or three weeks, seemed to the young lover-for that name may now be assumed for him without any impropriety-to have extended over several months. Facilities for travel between the great city and its most immediate dependencies were then few and miserable-what would now be called rather obstructions than facilities; just as some day in the near future, beyond a doubt, the people of that time will read of our day, when the most rapid transit for humanity has not yet reached beyond fifty or sixty miles the hour, and wonder how such hum-drum slow-coaches, unable to move anywhere within a reasonable time, managed to maintain existence outside the madhouse! No steam anywhere then, except as an infant experiment. The horse-boats had scarcely yet left the New York ferries, and Stevens was just putting on one of them, as a test of practicability, a couple of insignificant batteaux with steam-power such as might have been communicated by an ordinary breakfast tea-kettle. Beyond the immediate confines of the city, the coach or the clumsy gig by land, and the creeping packet-sloop or schooner by water, running and returning twice a week at oftenest, supplied the only link between the residents of the city and those who lived at less than thirty miles distance. It is no matter of surprise, then, that Charley Denniston, leaving the city one afternoon, did not reach his destination until some time past noon on the following day, driving through the farms lying northward, westward and inboard from Topsail, and remarking that a few hardy birds (no relation of his snipe!) were already beginning to whistle among the hedges, and that their rival whistler, the small farmer, was commencing to turn up the furrows from which the late frost had only within a few days taken its final departure. He remarked this as he rode, however much his mind may have been occupied with other and very different thoughts; for he had a quick and loving eye for nature and beauty, as perhaps his admiration of Lettice Holloway furnished the very best illustration: 
               Past noon when his hired conveyance drove through the little village and set him down once more at the "Eagle Tavern;" and very little past noon when Major Jeff Taddlewick, peering out with that sharp Roman nose and those treacherous gray eyes from his habitual loop-hole on the other side of the street, knew of the arrival and had noted it down for some additional investigation. "So that young fellow was down there again-was he! What was he doing down there so often? After that girl of Squire Holloway's-eh? And did he, a rich merchant's son, mean any good by her if he was? Not very likely! Not that he cared anything about it, even if he didn't-for them infernal upstart Holloways deserved all they could get, and worse! But he'd be cussed if he didn't mean to know all about it, before the thing was through-that he would!" (And, parenthetically, "before the thing was through" the Major did!") 
               Within half an hour following his arrival, after a very little attention to his personal appearance (he was no coxcomb, and yet good looking and human!) Charley Denniston walked up the main street of Topsail and made his appearance in the store of Squire Holloway. How much more rapidly than usual his heart beat during that walk-whether he was or was not impressed with the fact that every slattern woman looking from her door and every unkempt child playing in the road, knew of his errand at the village and was chuckling and grinning at him-how much of shame and how much of pride he felt in the consciousness that he was approaching a momentous crisis in his life-how many fears blent with his confidence, first in the unspoken love of the young girl and next in her unmercenary character-how many ordinary lives he lived during that brief progress of less than a quarter of a mile,-all this must remain untold if not unguessed. 
               He was once more within the store-that most miscellaneous of all collections-that most singular of all places to be the theatre of his search for a wife. He looked around the store with a strange palpitation of the heart, then fixed his eyes upon one particular spot with still greater agitation. Lettice Holloway was there, and alone. The "vast ocean of commerce" was for the moment casting no waifs at the feet of the Holloways. No customer was visible; the shock-headed Jim was enjoying his momentary liberty in some far-off Arcadia of black-smith shop or carpentry, where he could forge a horse-nail or carve out a wooden sword; and pretty Lettice, emulating all the busy bees of history or moral story, was sitting perched on a low step-ladder behind the counter, one leg and foot bent under her and used as a queer cushion for the seat, and the other hanging down the step-ladder and the extremity peeping out and showing, below the short dress, that swelling white-clad isthmus above the peninsular foot, with a delicious abandon that was perfectly ravishing. 
               Then the merry dark eyes looked up from the sewing, at the shadow in the door; the face assumed nearly all colors in an instant, and there was a sudden and very rapid change of position. Why it is that every woman, caught sitting on her foot, that (to us stupid males) very harmless position, immediately blushes and pretends that she was doing nothing of the kind,-is another of those interesting problems which need not be pursued to a solution. They all do it; and whether pretty Lettice most reddened at the position in which she had been discovered, or at the coming of the handsome fellow who had discovered her-is yet another problem. But she was glad to see the young New Yorker-very glad-beyond a question; for by the time he had neared the counter on the outer side and extended his hand to greet her, with: "ah, Letty!-and all alone!" (no "Miss Holloway" now!-see the progress that had been made!) she had sprung from the step-ladder, reached both little hands across the counter and was waiting for his second, with: "Mr. Denniston!-no, Charley! how glad I am to see you!" ("Charley" on that side, too!-more of that "progress" since the day of the ejection of hawbuck Steve Battersby!) 
               Then both blushed a little, as if each had been doing something shameful instead of merely giving and receiving a warm friendly greeting with all propriety. Women proverbially soonest recover from such awkwardnesses; and when Letty, smoothing down with an unconscious hand the apron over her neat, small-plaid gingham, and throwing back her refractory curls with a motion of the same innate and unacknowledged coquetry, came round the counter and joined him in that "neutral ground" outside,-she had nearly recovered her equanimity and there was mischief blending with the warm light in her eye; while Charley Denniston, who so much better knew what impended and thus had so much more warrant for being agitated-still kept the flushed color in his face and had by no means yet recovered that ease which could make him appear to personal advantage. He had the presence of mind, however, to compliment the young girl-most men can find brains for that when they have not much for any other expression. 
               "You are looking very well and very handsome, Letty!-do you know it?" 
               Know it? If she did not, words would have been wasted in conveying the information. And there was another shaking back of the saucy curls, and a glance down at the trim foot and the skirts which partially hid it away, as she replied: 
               "Do you think so, Mr. Denniston-Charley? You are such a stranger, now-a-days, that I almost forget to call you 'Charley'." 
               She had remarked his longer absence, then-even as he had hoped. One step in regard won, if no more-the young man thought; and he believed that he had really won many more. It made his head dizzy, just a little, to think of his standing so favorably in her regard. 
               "You think that I stay away too long?-you wish that I would come down to Topsail oftener, Letty?" 
               "I?" and all the latent coquetry of her nature flashed into the face and manner of the girl thus awkwardly asked to express a positive interest in a man who had never given her any more warrant than he. "I? No!-that is, I do not know why I should care about it, if you do not wish to come, yourself!" A light ripple of laughter, and just the least patting of the saucy little foot on the floor, accompanying this first alarmed rally of a nature on the verge of being made captive. 
               "But suppose that I do wish to come?" 
               "Oh, then I do not see what is to hinder you." She had a piece of twine from the counter in her fingers, by this time, and with those deft little fingers was tying it up into something that looked very much like a true-lovers-knot, glancing at it, meanwhile, with her head thrown on one side after the manner of a bird profoundly interested in some novelty of scene or sound. "And by the way, when did you come down, this time. Got here to-day?" 
               "To-day? Certainly, Letty! Do you think that I should have been in Topsail a whole day, without your seeing me?" 
               The young girl could not, for the life of her, keep a pleased little flush from rising again to her cheek; but she managed both tongue and manner very creditably. 
               "How should I know? Of course when you come here you come on business!" Did she look out of one corner of an eye at him, as she made that remark, or was it only an unfounded impression of his? "Are you going to be very busy this time? We-that is, my father, would be very glad to see you at the house, if you find leisure before you go away. Oh, I declare that I forgot!-you are a sportsman, Charley!-perhaps you come down to shoot!-" 
               "-Snipe?-no thank you!" and the peal of merry laughter that broke from the lips of the young girl was almost as merrily answered by her temporary victim, at the recollection. 
               "Well, you are a good fellow, Charley, and don't even mind my rattle!" the little tormentor said, when her peal of laughter was concluded. "I shall almost like you, some of these days!" 
               "Almost, Letty?-not quite?" and somehow the man who had been received with due shaking of hands felt it necessary to possess himself again of one of the tempting and rosy quintettes. 
               "Almost? Are you not satisfied with that, Charley? What a difficult fellow you must be! There-let go my hand!-there is a customer coming, and you don't know what stories they might be telling about me, one of these days-some of those old she-dragons with green heads!" (the green caleche bonnet then so much worn). "They are a dreadful set about here-so look out!" 
               There was a customer coming in at the moment, so that necessarily the hand was dropped, and the conversation, at least in that direction, was dropped with it. Charley Denniston, a little confused, though a good deal pleased, was somewhat at a loss to know precisely how much he had ascertained during its continuance, with reference to the young girl's feelings. 
               "Is your father at home?" he asked, as a cover to the sudden termination, as Letty hurried around the counter to attend to the customer. 
               "No, he's out this afternoon, Mr. Denniston,-will be at home this evening, I think. Will you call and see him?" 
               "Yes-be kind enough to say to the Squire, Miss Holloway, that I will call at the house this evening." 
               How naturally those two incipient hypocrites-for what else could they be called?-fell into "Mistering" and "Missing" each other, and treating each other as if approach nearer than a rod of distance was impossible,-the very moment that any third party came within sight and hearing! Bad symptoms, young people!-dangerous symptoms!-these uncandid beginnings. 
               But with that very polite and formal farewell, which might have suited the most captious prude of the village, Charley Denniston certainly left the store and strolled back to the Eagle Tavern, while Miss Lettie devoted herself to proving to her customers that she had not a thought in the world above selling corn-hoes and dispensing calico. 
               Probably both the young people indulged in a pretty vigorous and extended course of thinking, immediately after that interview; for the one knew precisely towards what all that had passed was tending and the other must have been something less than the keen, sensible girl that she appeared, if she remained in entire ignorance. But what could the thoughts of Lettice Holloway have been-open and transparent as had been her brief past, and candid and fair-dealing as all the future was to be, so far as she could know,-compared to the troop of hopes, fears, plans and suggestions which ran riot through the brain of the New Yorker? That the young girl, when he should ask her to be his wife, as he fully intended to do that very evening if opportunity was afforded, would first trifle a little, and then answer Yes to the most momentous of questions, he felt quite as certain as any young lover can be expected to feel in the presence of his first great trial. That she would be honest and unselfish in so answering, and give that reply, if she gave it at all, because she had learned to love him, and not because he was supposed to have a fortune at his command-he felt even more confidence than he did in the first event. But all this would gain nothing, for between himself and the girl would yet stand that difficult condition set by his father; and how could he devise such a trial of her unmercenary spirit as would fully satisfy that man who had no personal love like his own to plead in her behalf? All the books that he had ever read and all the plays that he had ever seen, involving trials of faith and concealments of ranks and wealth, were called up one by one during that walk back to the tavern, and during the dull hours of supper and silent thinking in his own chamber which followed it. But the truth is that Charley Denniston was by no means an inventive genius; and nothing came to him, after all, better than the plan of outraging his own feelings and the poor girl's sympathies by telling her that sudden ruin had fallen upon his family, trusting to her simplicity for cover to his own bad acting, and hoping to wring from her, during the little time that could elapse before the falsehood of his story became apparent, words of faith and acts of foundness that would carry conviction even to the least trustful heart. 
               This was the un-original and decidedly unsatisfactory determination at which only he could arrive; and this only was in his mind when that evening, an hour after supper, he knocked at the door of Squire Holloway's house and was admitted. Admitted, too, by Lettice herself, her dress that of a well-to-do country girl when the occupations of the day were ended, and her troublesome curls showing that some care had been taken to make them presentable before "company." Such a reception was pleasant-very pleasant: it was worth something to believe, the young man thought, that he had been expected with a little anxiety, evidenced by the mistress of the mansion opening the door herself instead of sending a servant; it was worth still more to note that she had thought enough of his coming to use some effort towards making herself as neat and womanly as possible. Then she seemed quite as willing as himself, he remarked, to shake hands over again, as if their last meeting had taken place a month previously instead of two or three hours. All this was flattering: more than flattering-it was encouraging. 
               With the exception of the "help" in other portions of the house, Miss Lettice was alone in it. The Squire had returned to the village and to his office, but had-unusual for him, as his daughter remarked-insisted upon aiding shock-headed Jim in the care of the store for the evening, leaving her to do the honors of the house to the expected visitor, and commissioning her to tell him, if he grew tired of Letty's company before the evening was over, to run up to the store and smoke a cigar with him. It did not seem very likely, unless the visitor was very unimpressible, that the latter invitation would he accepted; the evening closing dull and cold, with a threat of storm, did not make it probable that many visitors would drop in to make the society more numerous but less select; there was a prospect, and almost a certainty, of a long tete-a-tete between twenty-one and eighteen; and any suspicious person, aware of all the circumstances, might have thought that the astute old Squire had managed the arrangement very prettily, and his mercantile daughter played capitally into his hands, for a little love-making and possibly a declaration, which might eventually be found profitable in a pecuniary point of view and "a good thing to have in the" family! 
               Had there really been any thought of such a convenient arrangement on the part of the jollily-baronial old Squire of the Topsail Marshes, or his daughter whom kings might have wooed and queens envied? Those who knew them best would not have been likely to harbor the idea for a moment; it was only one more of those things so honestly intended-so easily misconstrued. 
               Perhaps because she felt that she was doing the honors of the house in her father's place, Lettice Holloway ushered her visitor into his special room, where he had more than once before sat, though in other company, since the day, some four months agone, when he there waited, with the old Squire, the roasting of the "capon" for that memorable dinner. There was again a cozy little fire flickering and wasting away into coals on the bright brass andirons, taking away the chill of the gusty March evening, and making the room the very ideal of one in which to read, or to chat with a friend or two, or-under peculiar stress of circumstances-to perform that pleasant but often difficult duty which our good ancestors chose to designate by the suggestive name of "courting." Pretty Lettice, a flash of undissembled pleasure in her eye, but threatening mischief curling her ripe and tempting mouth, dropped into her father's arm chair beside the lighted table, in which her petite figure came near to disappearing altogether, and took up again the work upon which she had before been employed when enjoying the luxury of Oriental sitting on the top of the step-ladder. Charley Denniston took the proffered chair on the other side of the fire-place, but felt at that moment more awkward, the first salutations over, than he ever remembered to have done before, since emancipated from the long-clothes of babyhood. He had been bold enough at the first meeting with the young girl; he had since that time before been alone with her and failed to show himself incapable of word or thought: just then, so much depending, he could not have mustered two consecutive words of that which he was so anxious to utter, had another life been the bribe. 
               Swiftly flew the deft white fingers for a moment or two of silence. Then, while biting off a thread, Lettice looked up and said: 
               "Why, how still you are, Charley! Are you in low spirits, or is it only the bad company?" 
               "Bad company-you? Pshaw, no! Low spirited, Letty? I do not know that I am. Heigho!" 
               "'Heigho!'-a sigh!-what does that mean, if you are not low spirited, I should like to know! Father was right-he can do the honors of the house better than I, and I will take his place in the store and send him over." 
               There was no doubt that she uttered this as half a taunt and half a threat, but without much intention of carrying it into execution. Charley Denniston scarcely heard her: for through his puzzled brain, at that moment, crowding away the previously-maddening image of Lettice Holloway and himself sit- ting in such a cozy little room with no necessity for leaving it except together and for a dearer,-was rushing the idea that the allegation of low spirits might be turned to account in the execution of his compelled villainy-that people who had lost all their property would have an understood right to sigh-that, in short, it was time for him to commence playing a part which would sit on him very ungracefully-that he must begin lying to the woman before whom he wished to lay bare his whole honest, loving heart, in order to obey and please a father who had educated him in the strictest reverence for truth and honor, and to make both that woman and himself happy by placing both in a false position! A strange anomaly in situation, certainly; but not more strange than inevitable under the circumstances. 
               "Lettice Holloway," he said, speaking very gravely, perhaps I did sigh. Perhaps I had good cause." 
               The young girl looked up again, half disposed to laugh at the idea, which seemed a droll one in her estimation, that he might be sighing for her,-and half alarmed at an undefinable something in his tone which suggested a more serious cause for his depression. But she did not speak, and the compelled conspirator stumbled on, dropping his head on his left hand to make the acting more effective. 
               "We have now known each other, Letty, for some four months. During all that time you have known me-or at least heard of me when you heard at all-as the son of a wealthy New York merchant and underwriter-rich, even now, through my father's kindness, and to have almost unlimited wealth at my disposal when I join my father and eventually take his place in the commercial world. Now would you think that I was sighing for nothing, if I should tell you that since I saw you last, misfortune has fallen upon my family-that unfortunate speculations have done with us as they have done with so many before-that we are ruined, beggared! 
               Now this was a very labored and stilted speech, and there were no doubt in the world persons keen enough to have discovered its forced character, but poor little Lettice Holloway was not one of them. She believed as gospel every word that the young scamp had thus conveyed by implication. 
               "Ruined, beggared? You, Charley?-Mr. Denniston?-it cannot be possible!" 
               The young man looked at her, furtively, and out of the corners of those apparently downcast eyes. And what did he see? Her face, usually so rosy, almost ghastly white: her eyes, usually so mischievous, filled with a startled expression that seemed to be blended of trouble and terror. He saw, and-heaven forgive him the terrible mistake!-for the moment he doubted her-felt that his father had indeed been right in demanding such a test. Had she really seen his love before his lips began to declare it,-intended to accept it, because it would give her wealth and position? Was that look of startled trouble the expression of her disappointment? Bitter thought!-he almost groaned aloud, without any pretence being necessary, in the agony which it forced upon him. 
               Directly, and without his being quite aware what was occurring, the young girl dropped the sewing from her lap, rose from her chair and stole across behind him where he sat. Before he fully comprehended the movement, he felt an arm laid upon his shoulder and the hand which belonged to the other arm creeping over the curls of his hair with something very like a pitying caress. He could not speak-could not stir, in pleased wonder that almost stupefied him. Then he heard-the young girl standing behind him and her hand still moving caressingly over his curls-heard these words murmured sweet and low, as if he was to hear and no one else save the All-hearing; 
               "Poor Charley!-all that money gone and you will be obliged to labor for your living, like the rest of us! I wish you did not feel so badly about it, but I suppose that you cannot help it-you who have been brought up to think that the world was full of money, to expect whatever you wished and not to know what the word disappointment means. I wish that I could cheer you up, Charley-I almost feel like calling you my brother Charley, now-I have been a little afraid of you before, when you were so rich, but now you come so much nearer to us poor country people. May I call you brother Charley?-and will you let me do something-ever so little-to make you feel less sorrowful at your great loss?" 
               A small Niagara of conflicting thoughts seemed to be pouring through Charley Denniston's head, just under the kind little hand at that moment; and the stream was compounded of reflections what an infernal young scoundrel and brute he was-how he had dared, first to try and then to misjudge that noblest girl in the world-how much superior to manhood, womanhood must be, always-and what a deliriously happy feeling there was to be found in the hand of a pure, innocent, warm-hearted young girl, touching those capillary tendrils lying so near the seat of all sensation. He tried to speak, once more, but again, though for a very different cause, he found himself in nearly the same speechless condition as at first. And he scarcely knew what he was saying, as he stammered out: 
               "Will you do something to-that is-to console me, as you say? What a good little girl you are, Letty! Call me 'brother?'-yes-anything you like." 
               "Then if you are to be my brother, you must not mourn and be unhappy over the loss of your money, while you have hands to work and health to win your way to any position you wish! went on the singular monitress, with her arm still on the shoulder-her hand still on the hair-as unsuspicious as possible that she was an electric spark and that a very extensive and dangerous powder-magazine was being perilled by her proximity. 
               "You think, then, Letty, that there may be happiness without that wealth-as much happiness without it as with it?" the young man summoned brain to enquire. 
               "Money is very convenient to have-it buys a good many things that we want, and-yes, I like money well enough," was the reply, "But no one, I think, was ever unhappy without it, who would not have been unhappy with it; and I never saw any one for whom I would give any more, with both pockets loaded down with gold and silver, than with the same pockets so light that they would blow away." 
               "And you believe that you could be happy without wealth?" he asked, in a tone scarcely audible yet audible to her.
                
               "Believe that I could, you silly fellow? I know that I could-that I can! I expect to be happy without money, all my life; for I expect to be happy anyhow, and the Lord knows that I never expect to be rich!" 
               Would this whole scene, so far as it had gone, have been quite satisfactory to Howland Denniston, as to the purity of purpose and unmercenary character of the young girl? Who can say? He must have been an unmerciful old inquisitor, if not! At all events, the ordeal seemed to his son to have been quite sufficient. 
               "Lettice Holloway, I love you! Do you-can you love me! Will you be my wife?" 
               How the two had so materially changed position within the instant occupied by the three exclamations, probably neither could have told. The instant before, Charley Denniston had been sitting, and Lettice Holloway standing, as already described: now he stood erect, his tall form towering above her, his arm around her supple waist, her curly head drawn close to his breast, and his eyes looking down, full of love and devotion, into those suddenly upraised in wonder and perhaps in alarm. But for the suddenness and the-ahem!-well, yes, the impropriety (the two being all alone), the picture presented by the progressing young lovers would have been rather a pretty one than otherwise! 
               Of course the girl yielded instantaneously, after that declaration, and cooed back her love and her satisfaction? Of course she did nothing of the kind-most emphatically! If some one will furnish us with a recipe for extracting the innate coquetry out of a woman's heart, we will engage to make all the soiled linen and greased flannels in the universe spotless, without ever a detergent. No!-Lettice Holloway had yielded at once when a call was made upon her sympathies, in behalf of one supposed to be in misfortune: but catch her allowing herself to be swept off her feet by a love declaration and an offer of marriage, in that manner! In somewhat less time than it had taken to gather her to that sudden embrace, she was out of it and standing six feet away, with both hands on her hips, her lip pouting saucily, and the words issuing from it: 
               "Well, I like that, Mr. Charley Denniston, for a brother! Was that what we were talking about, I should like to know?" 
               "Pshaw, Letty!" was the answer-a little confounded and embarrassed, it must be confessed. "You heard what I said-why do you trifle?" 
               "'Trifle'? He calls my natural indignation 'trifling'! You surely do not mean to tell me that brothers and sisters marry, in that wicked city of yours!" 
               "Of course I do, though perhaps they do not marry each other!" was the reply. 
               "Very good!-very good indeed! Why, how keen we are within the last two minutes!" and the little witch patted the small hands approvingly and laughed in a manner calculated to drive a sensitive man to distraction. 
               Charley Denniston was nonplussed-badgered-perhaps a little mortified, as many another man has been, under similar circumstances; but he very sensibly rallied under the infliction and decided that badinage must meet badinage or he should certainly find himself the loser in the contest. 
               "Well, I was a fool to ask you the question-I admit it!" 
               "Oh, you do? and why, pray?" 
               "Because I knew before I asked. You do love me and you are dying to tell me so at this moment." 
               That thrust must have hit home, for the tell-tale blood rushed to cheek and brow like a torrent. But though the face betrayed, the tongue was steadfast to its duty, fighting that last hopeless sham-fight of maiden freedom as if it had been doing battle in a more earnest cause. 
               "Impudence! I should like to catch myself loving you more than I dared to tell, at any early period!" 
               "Hold still!-pray do not move, for one moment!" What could Charley Denniston mean, by making so strange a request, in the midst of a combat of that character, and then walking off to a distance at one side and surveying the young girl from that point of view, with eyes asquint, as if she had been, a post and he an architect? 
               "Yes, it is as I feared, though I was not sure of it before!" he said, as he went back to his former position. "Your face is pretty enough, Letty, and your lips are very well-shaped, but I ought to have known better than to ask you a serious question, for you couldn't answer it. Your nose does turn up badly." 
                
               "It doesn't do anything of the kind, sauce-box!" and before she was aware of the action, Miss Lettice had given that member of her face a "smooth downward" which showed that she had probably heard the same observation, less impudently made, before. "And so you think that I love you, do you? Catch me at it! You look well enough now, to be sure-you are almost a good-looking young man, though if I were a man, and of your age, I would try to have more beard on my face. But only think what you will be by-and-bye!" 
               "Eh, and what will I be by-and-bye, prophetess?" 
               "Oh, you will be fat-fat as butter! see!" and she pointed to the full chest and well-developed figure-"your are getting stout already, and I never could endure fat people." 
               Does the reader think that this small-talk-run-mad has been carried far enough? So thought Charley Denniston, who began to lose patience in the presence of that bewitching impertinence. He had seen that she could be serious and thoughtful when the heart-emotions of others were to be considered (witness her treatment of poor Joe Harrison!) and he meant to make her so once more, before that interview concluded, or never again lay the truth of his feelings at her feet. 
               "Stop, Lettice Holloway!-stop! This trifling nonsense has gone far enough. My heart does not respond to it, neither does yours-I am certain. I love you-deeply, devotedly. I have told you so. I believe that you love me. Come here, and tell me, soberly and earnestly, that you will be my wife!" 
               Before the young girl could escape his clutch he had grasped her again round the waist, with his right arm; with the other arm and hand had again drawn her curly head close to his broad breast, with the handsome, mischievous face turned upward; and as he spoke those earnest, manly words his face, by an irresistible impulse, bent suddenly down over the one upturned to it, and Lettice Holloway felt the breath on her face of lips approaching hers in a first kiss which her lover would no more have ventured before that moment than he would have thus approached the marbled mouth of some shrined Madonna. 
               Was the spirit of coquetry yet conquered altogether? Not quite!-or perhaps there was really a startling reality in that approaching first love-kiss. For a moment she writhed and twisted like a serpent to prevent it, then broke from the stronger arm that held her, and fled, with something of terrible earnest mastering the mischief in her face-away from him and through the first door she could reach, which chanced to be that opening into the parlor of which Squire Holloway had spoken-that "best room" devoted to "company who came in squads," and where stood "Letty's bit of finery, there, that they call piano." But if the young girl's blood was up, so was that of her wooer, and she had by no means escaped. He was through the door nearly as soon as herself-too soon for her to close it if she so intended; and before she had reached the other end of the room he was again by her side-again with that audacious arm around her waist. 
               "Let me go, Charley Denniston, I say! I do not love you!-I will not let you kiss me!-I will die before I own-. Oh, what am I saying? I have been lying before you-dear, dear mother! Forgive me, mother! oh forgive me!" 
               She had slid down from the arm that held her, and was on her knees on the floor, in that brief instant-her arms outstretched towards the wall and her voice breaking down from the sharp determination with which she had begun to speak, until the last words were uttered in sobs and through unmistakable tears. The young man shuddered, as if there was really some bodily presence near them of which he had not known: then his eyes followed her outstretched arms and he caught some dim perception of the influence which had wrought so singular and sudden a change. 
               Through the open door the blended firelight and candle-light from the apartment they had just quitted streamed into the room making all the objects it contained plainly visible, and throwing a still broader ray on the wall opposite the door, towards which Lettice was kneeling. He saw-what if he had ever before seen he had not noticed-that on the wall hung a life-sized half-length in oil, of a very beautiful woman, dark-eyed and with curls like Letty's, but taller and more stately-in the puffed hair, bared arms, and short-waisted dress of five-and-twenty years before. And then he knew that he had followed the young girl into the presence of her dead mother-that she was kneeling in that presence, sobbing out her contrition for something which that mother would not have approved, as if the cold canvas could hear and the sightless eyes beam down forgiveness! 
               "Letty-dear Letty!-I did not know-I have no business here. Come to me when you are calmer!-and Charley Denniston, with true delicacy, turned to leave that strange confessional. 
               "No-do not go. Remain here-here is the place for both of us!" answered the strange girl, rising to her feet, and her sobs gradually dying away. There was no lightness, no badinage in her tone, now-it was low, soft, sweet and musical, as he had heard it that day in the store piazza when she was speaking out the truth of her nature in pity. "Charley Denniston, give me your hand." He did so, with wonder, and she went on. "Here, in the presence of my dead mother, before whom I never told a lie while she lived and dare not now that she has gone away to heaven-here I am going to answer you a question that affects my whole life and may make it something else than it would be. I ask you to answer me one question in the same presence, as you would if you stood in the very presence where my poor mother has gone. You told me, a little while ago, that your family had lost all their property-that you had become poor. A few minutes afterwards you said that you loved me-asked me to be your wife. Tell me, from your soul, would you have said the same words to me, to-day, if you had remained the rich man's son?-was I your equal before, as you think me now?" 
               Oh, how solemn that adjuration, little commanding as were the face and the figure enforcing it! What man so base as to have falsified in the answer? Alas, many-but not Charley Denniston. As the last words concluded, he sank on his knee on the very spot where the young girl had been kneeling the moment before, and said, lifting his hand towards the picture and his eyes towards heaven: 
               "As God and your sainted mother hear me, Lettice Holloway, while I was yet the rich man's son I intended to ask for your love-to ask you to be my honored wife; and I should have done so, this day, had I been wealthy as ever I believed myself to be!" 
               The merchant's son attempted to rise, but he did not do so as he knelt; for at that moment Lettice Holloway fell on her knees beside him, her arms around his neck, her head of bright curls resting on his bosom, and her lips upturned for the kisses that fell upon them like a storm of red snow-flakes, while between those kisses he managed to say: "Lettice! my own dear little Lettice!-God bless you forever for this moment!-" and she found language brokenly to reply: "Love you, Charley? Heaven and my mother who is there, know that I love you-have loved you ever since the first day that we met! I am very wild, and strange, and naughty-I know it; but I believe that I should have died if you had not compelled me to tell you the truth!" 
               "And you will never torment me again, little one? you will be mine, now, whether I am rich or poor-whenever and however I ask you?" 
               "I will be yours and yours only-your wife whenever and however you ask me-so help me heaven and look down upon me my dead mother!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER 
                     XXVIII.
                     XXXI.
                  
                
               CHARLEY'S PUZZLE, AND THE MAJOR'S SECRET. 
               IT may be supposed that Charley Denniston did not wish to hold conversation with any one-not even the father of his promised bride, on the night which thus apparently sealed his happiness, and when the growing lateness of the hour warned him to return to his bachelor quarters at the "Eagle." There are dishes of such luxury, at some banquets, that after them the most delicious of other food can only be an insult to the palate: there are hours so crowded full of the crowning sensations of a lifetime, that following them the most piquant of amusements and the most interesting of conversations must be dull and annoying. The Squire yet lingered at the store, and before he returned the young man had bidden farewell to his promised bride, at the old bulls-eyed door, with a farewell kiss returned quite as warmly and lingeringly as it was given, and with the pressure of a pair of fond arms about his neck, which seemed to linger there and make a pleasant weight for hours after they were removed. 
               It may reasonably be supposed, too, that the happy lover made his way back to the "Eagle" with the usual means of locomotion-to wit, walking with his feet and on the footpath that bordered the high road; but he certainly could not have made oath that he was not walking on his head instead of those feet-and that the footpath was not situated somewhere up among the clouds and the stars that were playing hide-and-seek with each other in the raw and gusty March night. Everything seemed changed, since he had walked over the same path two hours before; and yet, strangely enough, there came crowding on him the recollection of every time he had traversed that path, from the day when he first walked up from the tavern to make intercession with the Squire in behalf of Barnard North; and once when he paid indifferent heed to his footing and partially stumbled over a stone, he remembered the stone and that he had stumbled over it on that first day which opened so important a chapter in his book of life! Some such clairvoyance amid confusion as this, has been experienced by nearly every man at one time or another-at the moment of a deep grief or an over-whelming joy; and is there a lover who has ever known those dear night-walks over the breezy hills and by the green road-sides of the country, with the meetings at the door, and the late partings at the latticed gate under the waiting moon or the watching stars,-but can remember how once and again, when heart and brain were full of widely different thoughts, stump, or tree, or glimmering vista of distant sleeping farmsteads, has seemed to claim recognition from the loving eye, and to be as familiar as the very door-step of home? 
               Then how he slept that night in his dingy little room up-stairs at the "Eagle," or whether he slept at all-what matter? Or what matter whether around his pillow floated legions of seraphic spirits, outraging all the conditions of angelhood as seen by the old painters, by having dark curls instead of floating locks of gold, and short dresses of plain gingham instead of sweeping robes of etherial white woven in celestial looms? Youth makes little account of sleep; and there are some dreams worth twice their length in quiet slumber. Enough to say that he slept, (more or less), rose, saw in the cracked bit of looking glass in his chamber a face which he recognized as belonging to some one else than himself, breakfasted on broiled Letty (or some meat that seemed very like it), and after smoking three bad cigars in order to acquire the partial intoxication necessary, and after spending two hours succeeding breakfast that seemed unendurably long and stupid, before going to do what seemed to him more tiresome and stupid still-walked half a mile around by a bye-road in order to approach Squire Holloway's store without passing his house, and to avoid seeing or being seen by one whom he wished to see again more intensely than all the rest of the world put together! 
               Lettice Holloway was not in the store as he passed through-he had felt that she would not be, that morning of all mornings during a dozen years. Neither was the Squire. Shock-headed Jim, with candied face and molasses-smeared fingers, had the institution all to himself and informed the visitor, before he had made any enquiry, that "Miss Letty was hum ter the house and the old Squire was up stairs ter the office." And there, indeed, the Squire was found, sitting at his desk, pen across his mouth but hearty mischief in his eye, rummaging over and noting certain papers in a late decision of his own, that were to be carried up by the dissatisfied loser to that stupendous high tribunal of appeal, the Common Pleas of the County. Rod was perched on his stool, as usual, copying papers, as usual, and his face on a smirk that very much wished to expand into a broad gain-also as usual. 
               "Good morning, Squire!" said the young man, a little unconquerable trepidation in his tones, under the awful circumstances (your father-in-law-that-is-expected-to-be is always an awful personage), and with his eyes falling to the floor more markedly than they were in the habit of doing. 
               "Ah, good morning, Mr. Denniston-glad to see you, sir!" answered the Squire, dropping the pen from his mouth, rising and holding out his hand. But the young man, raising his eyes after their abasement, fancied that he saw harder lines than he had ever before noticed around the mouth, and that the materials for a possible frown were accumulating upon the usually placid forehead. The observation did not re-assure him, especially as the Squire made it evident that he was both prepared and anxious for a private conversation, by addressing Rod in a sterner voice than ordinary, with a command which sent that young person tumbling from his stool and flying out of the room as if a bomb-shell had invaded the abode of law. 
               "Roderick!" reaching over and taking a small bundle of papers from a pigon-hole-"take these papers over to Mr. Barker, and see that you are back again in an hour. Do you hear me?-go quick, and no capers!" 
               The room thus cleared of all except themselves, the Squire motioned the young man to a chair, resumed his own seat, and the momentous occasion drew rapidly to a crisis. The omens were unpleasant. Charley Denniston had no doubt whatever of the favorable result of the interview-the old man evidently liked him, and had evidently liked him from the first; and it was not probable that he would refuse his daughter's hand, she consenting, to the scion of a family of the wealth and standing possessed by his-but the materials accumulated on the forehead were certainly being built up into a frown, and what did it all mean? 
               "I hope you excused my not spending the evening with you last night, Mr. Denniston," he said, when they were seated. "But my daughter and myself could not both be away from business at the same time, and I had reason to believe that of the two you would prefer her company if you could not have both." 
               "Certainly I did-that is-I do not mean that I preferred her company, but that Letty-Miss Holloway-was very agreeable company, and that, you-you were quite excusable." 
               "Humph;" continued the Squire, with something cynical in his manner which the other had certainly never before noted in him-"you must have had a very pleasant evening, if all that my daughter tells me is correct!" 
               "She has told you?-you know all, then?" the young man uttered, in something very nearly approaching to a stammer. 
               "I know quite enough, young man!" replied the Squire, in a tone of severity which chilled his auditor quite as much as a pail of cold water thrown over him could have done. 
               "She told you, then, that-" this and nothing more the nonplussed New Yorker managed to ejaculate. 
               "That you, Mr. Denniston, did her the honor to offer her marriage, and that she was fool enough to allow herself to be persuaded into giving you a favorable answer, five minutes after you had informed her that you had not a dollar of property left in the world!-that you were, as you yourself phrased it, a beggar!" 
               There was no mistaking, just then, the severity of voice of the man whom Charley Denniston had always before heard and seen to so different an advantage,-nor could the displeased look of brow and eye be ignored. Good heaven!-was that man so mercenary, after his daughter had been proved and found otherwise? The young man thought at the moment, that one of the stars could not have surprised him much more by tumbling down from heaven and turning into a pebble at his feet; and that the course most consistent with his own self-respect would be to bid that unmasked old humbug a good morning, leave the office, and never come near it or his house again while he lived! But then, Lettice Holloway!-she was not implicated in her father's want of generous feeling-could he leave her? No!-emphatically, No! But into what a scrape had he not plunged himself by obeying his father's be best and falsifying his pecuniary position! All this, of course, ran though his bewildered brain in a moment; and there was scarcely a pause before he said, in reply to the last ungenerous observation: 
               "Am I to understand, then, Squire Holloway, that you disapprove-" 
               "That I disapprove of your making love to my daughter, and talking of marrying her, when you have not a cent upon which to support her? Certainly! Why, hark you, Mr. Denniston!-without money, what can you do to support a wife in comfort? Nothing-absolutely nothing! You have been used to plenty of money and even luxury, as I have always understood; and I tell you, in the first place, that I have no such means as would keep you and your wife-supposing that you had one-in comfortable idleness, and in the second place that I do not mean to have what little I have managed to scrape together, used up in that manner." 
               "Squire Holloway, I confess that I am very much surprised-" the young man commenced to say, cursing his stars, meanwhile, that his father's condition held him back from confounding that mercenary wretch by showing that he could buy and sell him twenty times over; but again the irascible father interrupted him: 
               "Yes, I have no doubt that you are surprised, Mr. Denniston-very much surprised. Young people generally are when older ones speak a little common sense and display a little ordinary prudence in their presence! And now I am going to surprise you again. You suppose, of course, that I am going to forbid you my house, or do some other foolery of the sort. Nothing like it. I have no objections to you, personally-believe that you are a good, clever young man, and could not wish for a better husband for Letty, if you only had the means to support her. I do not even wish you to break the engagement which it seems that you have formed like a couple of silly children. I am in no hurry for my daughter to marry, for she is a good girl and very useful; so that I need not be looking for another husband for her, and I do not care how long you keep shilly-shallying. Only do not, and you shall not, marry while you are poor-unless you get so pepery that you run away with each other, and then of course I cannot help myself. Come to the house as often as you please-see Letty whenever you wish; but remember that my mind is made up as to anything more." 
               "I am glad that you gave me that permission," said the young man, rising, and in a voice as low and broken as his spirits. "I have not been met, I confess, exactly as I expected to be, and so I do not know that I am prepared to answer you as fully as I ought. I shall accept your permission to visit your house, occasionally, during the few days that I remain in the country-that is, provided you believe that your daughter will still be glad to see me, with her new understanding of your will." 
               "She! Oh, don't worry about that, young man! She will be glad to see you-I'll be bound-every hour in the day and a few times in the evening by way of variety!-She's just spooney enough!" This was the reply, in a tone which did not seem quite as hard as some of the observations which had preceded it. 
               "I will not hinder you from business any longer, then: good morning!" 
               "Good morning!" from the Squire, who thereupon resumed his researches into the case of Wiggins vs. Thompson, stated demand $5,50, for damages done by a cow to a corn-patch, the costs of which, before going to appeal, had only reached, including lawyers" fees, $42,83. The young man left the office and descended the stairs, very soon after which disappearance the old Squire again laid down his pen, dropped back in his chair, threw up his legs on the desk, and indulged in a loud, long roar of laughter which might have been the twin brother of that vented after the departure of the Widow Benson. 
               "Ha! ha! ha!-ho! ho!" he roared in a species of guffawing soliloquy. "I am not sure this thing will not kill me yet! I am sure that if he had not got out of the office I could not have held in much longer! Suspects my daughter and myself of being mercenary and receiving his visits on account of his money, does he?-and plays such a stale trick as that to test us! Ha! ha! ha!-ho! ho! And that poor little simpleton couldn't see through the trick but took it all for gospel, and is half breaking her heart at the idea that her' dear Charley' had lost all his money! Catch as old bird as I am, with such thin chaff as that, will you! Ha! ha! ha!-ho! ho! But I've salted you nicely, I fancy, Mr. Charley Denniston, to pay you for trying to humbug me; and I do not think that I am quite done with you, yet!" 
               Charley Denniston returned to the "Eagle Tavern," that day, by the same roundabout way in which he had left it. If he had been nervous about seeing or being seen by Lettice Holloway, when he went up to the office and before he had secured her father's sanction to his suit,-he had no idea whatever of confronting her now, when he had just been so mortified and disappointed-tumbled into such a pit-hole of embarrassment and botheration. Nor did he leave the tavern again, during the day-near as she was and crazy as he really was to see her if he had only dared! The March sky was growing colder and more blustering; the east wind was bringing in the thick clouds of what is somewhat doubtfully called the "vernal" equinox; and there was no temptation to remain out of doors. There was a dilapidated fire-place in the tavern room to which he was as usual billeted. In that room he ordered a fire, which was made of green wood cut late during the winter, supplying him with smoke enough for the background of a whole field of speculations. And in that room he spent the day, ay, and the evening-by turns trying to fix his attention on the library therein contained, consisting of "Alonzo and Melissa," a well-thumbed and most life-like novel with one third of the volume torn away; "Captain Riley's Narrative" of his credible adventures in Morocco and the Great Desert; and the "Farmer's Almanac" for 18-, in the latter of which he read how to cure burns, how to prevent the pip in young chickens, and that the Yearly Meetings of the Pennsylvania Friends for that and the following year were to be held at Wain-Oak and Blackwater;-and during all the balance of the time, except when he descended to his meals, walking up and down the uncarpeted room, his boot-heels ringing confusion to all in the story below, and his brain pondering-pondering-pondering-until it verily reeled, how he could carry out his compact with his father and yet accomplish his marriage without one hour of unnecessary and dangerous delay-even before he returned to the city, if such a thing might be. 
               Suddenly Mephistopheles stood at his ear-invisible, as he is to most persons, but an audible whisperer, as he is to many. Mephistopheles recalled to his mind a hint unwittingly-of course unwittingly-thrown out by the Squire in the midst of his most cruel tirade-that "they should not marry, while he was poor, unless they got so peppery as to run away with each other, and then of course he could not help himself." It was necessary, Mephistopheles whispered, that he should remain poor, both to the young girl and her father, until the marriage should be consummated,-in order to give his father the assurance demanded; Lettice Holloway had promised to be his wife "whenever and however he should ask her;" there was enough of spring, mischief and vim in the young girl to do what many other girls of the same purity of character would not consent to do, under any stringency of promise; her eloping with him, with supposed poverty on one side and known parental displeasure on the other, would be the very best proof of her devotion and disinterestedness which his father could demand; there was no harm in an elopement, when it was meant well and had perfect security against misrepresentation; why should he not demand of Lettice Holloway the fulfilment of her promise, run away with and marry her, and thus put the whole matter at rest, at once and forever? 
               "He almost dared me to do it, in that fling about 'running away'-the mercenary old curmudgeon!" soliloquised the young man, at this stage of reflection on the whisper of Mephistopheles. It was well along in the evening when this point was reached; he had been half muttering aloud, more than once during his long colloquy with himself; and just now, confident of being alone, warmed by the thought and a little reckless of consequences he was guilty of the imprudence of breaking out at the full pitch of ordinary conversation. The room had grown warmer, too, as the green wood dried and fell gradually into a blaze; and between the heat of the apartment and the fire of his own disposition he began to feel that he needed air, and kicked open the door into the passage, just as he finished declaring his desperate resolution: "He did dare me to do it, and I will do it! Squire Holloway, if you don't find your daughter missing, before forty-eight hours, you are a sharper man than I think you, or I am a fool!" 
               People should never mutter or soliloquize aloud. If they have anything to say, they should speak boldly and at somebody; if they have nothing to say, silence is advisable. Very awkward results sometimes flow from these imprudently loud culminations of overwrought feeling. Very awkward results were to flow from Charley Denniston's outburst, accompanied by that ill-advised assault and battery upon the unoffending door. 
               Major Jeff Taddlewick had been all that day the victim of an unaccountable worry-a perturbation of mind, such as is often known to be felt by the peculiarly gifted, on the eve of great but unsuspected events. The coming of Charley Denniston to Topsail, again, without his knowing why he came, had worried him the day before. His going up to Squire Holloway's the same night and remaining there for more than two hours, while the Squire was absent at the store-his going again the next morning, that time to the store and by an indirect way-his coming back again by the indirect way-his remaining all the balance of the day within doors-all this (duly noted) had wrought seriously upon the sensitive organization of the Major Work grew distasteful (that is, more distasteful); visitors to the shop were unwelcome (because they could bring him no solution of the "goings on" which he felt certain were in progress.) So when the night fell he laid aside his apron, put on his coat and went over to the "Eagle," ostensibly for a glass of toddy and a cigar, but really, it is to be feared, to put himself into nearer communication with the mystery. 
               There the Major found the usually goodly evening assemblage in the bar-room, a few of the shoremen from below and the balance made up of a pedlar or two and a number of idle loungers belonging to the village-all hazed away in smoke and perfumed with villainous whiskey. But he found something else, much more important. All the loungers in the room were talking of the noise of the boot-heels overhead-their continued trampling backward and forward, and the certainty which seemed to exist that the man who had spent several hours in that occupation must be seriously troubled in mind. The landlord had informed them of the personality of his lodger, and some of the shoremen remembered the handsome young fellow of that name who had been down with Hawkins and afterwards believed to have been instrumental in the vigorous defence of the Wrecker. Such a man as he, the son of an eminent New York merchant, was not very likely, as they knew, to be a great criminal, trying to walk away the torments of his misdeeds; and they could only suppose, and did suppose, that he must have fallen into some difficulty connected with the tender passion. Here the occupants of the bar-room, though not a little annoyed by the clank of the boot-heels, were disposed to let the affair rest, and to be rather sorry than otherwise for a worthy young fellow who had fallen into a trouble which made him so restless. But the coming in of Major Jeff Taddlewick put another face upon the matter. When he had heard the steady pacing to and fro, and listened to the information tendered by the landlord, that "that there young feller hadn't eat hardly a drotted bit o'supper, though they'd had stewed soft-clams and fresh bread o' the ole woman's own making' and plenty of 'em!"-why then the Major, laying his finger beside his Roman nose, nodding his head and winking his eye mysteriously, confided to the company that "he knew a thing or two about that affair, and would tell them all they wanted to know, one of those days!" 
               Then the Major, pending those fuller and more important revelations which he for the time deferred, stayed the stomach of curiosty-so to speak-by imparting in strict confidence (to all) the fact that he had been aware, ever since Charles Denniston first came down to Topsail, of some secrets connected with his family, that would make people stare when they should become generally known; and that he was pretty well aware what was the matter with the young man in the present instance, keeping him in that restless and miserable condition. Thereafter, by those of the company who did not thoroughly know him, the Major ascended into additional estimation as a "keen' un," from whom no one could keep any secret away; while even those who did know him felt rather amused than indignant at the ready audacity of his lying. 
               A few moments later, the Major went back to his shop; and a few moments still later he came over again to the "Eagle" bar-room. The loungers were all yet in their places, and still, with very few interruptions, the tramp! tramp! tramp! of the merchant's son went on overhead. But there had been one important change-while absent, the Major had changed his boots for a pair of list slippers among his stock, and armed himself with a big (concealed) nail-gimlet. After talking a very few minutes following his return, he laid his finger again beside his Roman nose, winked again to the assembly generally, informed them (including the landlord, who would rather have offended the whole State government than him) that he had some special reasons, connected with the cause of justice, for needing to know precisely what was going on up-stairs, opened the door leading thitherward, and disappeared, very silently, thanks to his list slippers. 
               What the major really intended to do, in the way of spying, can only be conjectured from the big nail-gimlet concealed in his pocket. The possession of that implement would have led to the natural conclusion that he intended to ensconce himself in one of the rooms adjoining that occupied by the lodger, bore a hole in the single wooden partition, and through that hole take a general survey of the room, any papers that might be lying about, and the appearance and action of the occupant. If such was his intention (and such things have been done, before now, by the Major Jeff Taddlewicks of this spying world, for the purposes of legal evidence and otherwise), he did not carry it out in that instance. He had no occasion, whatever; for stealing quietly along the passage in the direction of the mysterious room, all that he needed to know, and much more than he expected to know, was literally forced upon him by the kicking open of the door and the loud utterance of those concluding words from within, already recorded: "Squire Holloway, if you don't find your daughter missing, before forty-eight hours, you are a sharper man than I think you, or I am a fool!" 
               It is not too much to say that the Major was literally knocked out of breath by this revelation striking him full in the face. Good heavens! abduction, seduction, every other kind of "duction," arranging in that quiet and virtuous village, and he alone to be aware of it-he alone to be the means of betraying the intention and foiling the villainy! Not that he had really any objection to such things taking place, as they were all "grist to his mill" for exposing the follies and vices of society and showing that every human being (except himself-he was virtuous) was radically and irretrievably bad,-but that there was more sensation to be made by exposing the arrangement and helping to nip it in the bud. And a villainy in that direction, too-of all directions! If there was any one thing in which Major Jeff Taddlewick had failed, through years of trial, it was in the attempt to get upon an equality with Squire Billy Holloway-to secure recognition from that legal magnate and thus worm deeply enough into his affairs to be able to sting him effectually by-and-bye. He was pretty confident that he had the clue in hand, now, that must bring the Squire to terms-that must secure recognition, gratitude, and eventual revenge for all past slights and undervaluations. 
               Within three minutes thereafter, and without waiting any further revelations, Major Jeff Taddlewick was down in the bar-room again, where, to the questions eagerly put to him by those who had remained below, (the Major was too keen to divide a valuable secret, or even a suspicion of one) he said that he had not been able to see or hear anything unusual-that the young man seemed to him, from his holding his hands to his face, to have the tooth-ache, which probably made him so restless-that he must have been mistaken in supposing that anything unusual was happening-and that he himself was sleepy and was going home to bed. To the latter end he really did go home-then changed his slippers again for boots, and within twenty minutes was knocking at the door of Squire Holloway's house, after making the discovery, by peeping and enquiring, that Letty was at the store and the Squire at the house and in his own room. 
               It cannot be said that the legal dignitary received the military one with empressement: in fact, when ushered into the room where he was sitting, he did not even invite him to take a chair. But a few minutes and a few words sometimes make a marvellous difference in our estimation of people (real or pretended); and the Major had no sooner opened his errand and his budget of news by informing his host that he had overheard (altogether accidentally) some words at the "Eagle Tavern," that evening, seriously affecting the welfare of his (the Squire's) family, than he found himself forced down into a chair and treated as if he had been the most honored guest who had ever entered those walls. 
               The story was told, with fewer enbellishments and alterations than were to be expected under the circumstances. The Major had had occasion, that evening, to pass the door of the room occupied by the young New Yorker, on his way to another occupied by a man with whom he had business; and as he passed the door of that room he had been surprised and horrified to hear the young man venting the most bitter boasts and threats that he would carry off, ruin and disgrace the Squire's daughter, in revenge, as he, the Major, believed from the context, for some fancied insult or slight received from the Squire himself. Astounded that such villainy could be contemplated, and entertaining, as the Squire must already have known, the very highest anxiety for the welfare of himself and family, he had not lost a moment in communicating the intelligence, which he begged the Squire not to disregard or treat lightly. 
               The Squire did not disregard the intelligence. He was evidently affected by it-deeply affected and it was probably the proudest moment of Major Jeff Taddlewick's life, when Squire Holloway rose from his chair, grasped him by the hand as if he had been his brother, and in a voice broken by emotion thanked him for the interest he took in his family, begged him not to mention one word of his discovery to any living soul in the village, and informed him that there was no other person in whom he could implicitly confide, and that he must depend upon him (the Major) to be his active assistant in the measures which he would immediately arrange for detecting the young scoundrel and punishing him in the most exemplary manner. 
               To be treated as a bosom friend by the Squire was much; but to be employed by him as his confidential adviser and aid, in a matter affecting the honor of his family, was more. The Major instantly resolved that he would not say one word of the affair, until it was over, to man, woman or child in the village, because doing so would endanger his confidential commission; and to the request of the Squire that he would act for him and with him, and be ready to answer at a moment's notice any summons he might send, he assured the unhappy father that he might count upon him to do anything and everything-to go through fire and water in his behalf, if necessary. 
               The Major had not been received with empressement, but he was dismissed with as much as any reasonable man could have desired. The Squire shook hands with him again, evidently very much affected, before he went away; and the Major strutted homeward and went to bed, prouder than he had ever before been since the bloodless epauletts of a slab-militia Major were first voted on his dumpy shoulders. 
               As for the Squire-his voice continued broken by emotion, even after the departing Mercury had gone beyond ear-shot of the door; but it must be confessed that the emotion did not seem to be melancholy. He lay back in his great arm-chair and laughed, just such a hearty, round sonorous laugh as he had indulged in, on the morning of the same day, in his office; and this broken, too, by a few ejaculations: 
               "Ha! ha! ha!-ah!-ah!-ah! That miserable hound is lying, of course, but there's something in it! The leaven's working, and won't there be sport! Go through fire and water to help me, will he?-well, I'll try him! Ha! ha! ha!-ho! ho! ho! Oh, this is too good!" 
               Immediately thereafter the Squire went out into the kitchen, and brought in to his room the same coarse-armed but pleasant-faced "help" whom we have seen attending at the door and assisting at that eventful dinner. He held quite a long conversation with her, there, the purport of which cannot be given; but he seemed to have set her at some task, for his concluding words, as he shoved her out at the door again and sent her back to the kitchen, were: 
               "Now you know me, you jade, and know that what say I will do. Do what I tell you-no matter how-any way-and hold your tongue; and you shall have your wages doubled for a whole year. And if you don't do it, by George I'll turn you out of the house before you are a week older!" 
               The "help" giggled a little, but said that she would "try," and took her way back to her own domain, where she laughed as freely as her employer had done a little while before; while the Squire himself, his face all one glow of mischievous merriment, which he was vainly trying to bring down to the gravity that became him, bent his steps towards the store, to release Letty and to see that shock-headed Jem did not leave more than half the windows open in the momentous operation of "shutting up." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXII. 
               THE SETTING OF THE BEDROOM WATCH. 
               SQUIRE HOLLOWAY'S permission, that the man who was not to be allowed to marry his daughter, "while he was poor," might yet visit his house and her unrestrained,-was taken advantage of at no remote period. The next morning after the lover's extended promenade and the discovery made by Major Jeff Taddlewick, saw the young man entering the bulls-eyed door again-this time his knock being answered, not by Lettice Holloway herself, but by the "help" whose instructions have so lately been indicated if not explained. Miss Lettice, however, as the woman informed the visitor, was within, up-stairs and for the moment busy, but would no doubt see him in a few minutes if he would walk into the Squire's room, while the Squire himself was at the office and would probably not be at the house during the morning. Here was more "luck" for Charley Denniston, if, as seemed probable, he had some matured plan in his mind and some words of importance to speak to his pretty finance-the "curmudgeon" out of the way, Lettice at home, the house clear of any one who could spy or intrude, and everything precisely as he could have wished it to be. So he thought, certainly, as again he was ushered into the Squire's room and the door closed upon him. 
               So he might not have thought, quite so certainly, if he had heard and seen the "help," after calling up stairs: "Miss Letty!-please to come down right away!-there's a gentleman wants to see you!" going through certain motions and uttering certain low words suggestive of a new employment which in no slight degree alarmed her physical and shocked her moral sense! 
               The Squire, like many other men who have attained competence and advancing years at the same time, had a fancy for sleeping very near his sitting-room, so that when he chose to retire he did not need to go far from his chair to his bed, and no other member of the household would be seriously disturbed by his removal. When the weather was chilly (as it certainly was just then-so near the coast and at that time in March) another of his quasi-luxurious requirements was almost always observed-to wit, the small door leading into the bed-room and in the corner of the rear wall of the sitting-room, was left open by the breadth of a hand, or less, so that the fire in the one would moderate the atmosphere in the other. Hearing, within the bed-room, of what was spoken in the sitting-room, was consequently not difficult; and the facilities for ambuscading therein were very materially increased by a second door leading into the bed-room, at the other end, from the direction of the hall and the kitchen. It is just possible that the Squire, in setting the "help" her task, had depended very materially upon this arrangement of rooms and doors, and upon the fact that his own room was the only one in which a fire was regularly kept in ordinary spring weather,-for learning, as he certainly intended to do, through that domestic channel, all the plans and purposes of the matrimonial conspirator. 
               Charley Denniston was not more than duly seated by the slight blaze in the fire-place, to wait for his inamorata, when the Squire's humble ally made her way along the hall and into the bed-room by the second of the doors named, muttering, as she did so, some words which when intelligibly put together would have been very like the following: 
               "Well, I never thought to be doin' this 'ere, even for him! 'Taint right-I know it ain't, to be spyin' onto them young folks; and yet it must be right, or he wouldn't tell me to do it! Leastwise, I daren't refuse to do what he axes me, and me so beholdin' to him; and if there's anything werry wrong the fault will be his'n and not mine-that's one comfort! I'm a goin' to do it-ony, Lord bless my soul!-what'll become of me if that ere wild young critter happens to bust into the bed-room after anything and I can't git out o' the tother door afore she catches me!" 
               Thus reassured and yet thus fearful of the consequences, the strong-armed "help" dodged into the bed-room and ensconced herself there, carrying in a small armful of bed-linen with which, if caught, she could pretend to have been doing something with the bed, and leaving the door open behind her for hasty retreat. Unconsciously she was furnishing an illustration, in this compelled acceptance of a task which she felt to be of very questionable propriety, and in her throwing upon her employer all the moral responsibility involved, of that feudal attachment and blind obedience to those holding the hereditary rank of superiors in power and wealth, which has by no means died out by a change of continents and the teachings of a republican form of government. What she was muttering, in justification of herself, was precisely the same, in effect, that the stout old crusader Wardrow spoke, seven centuries before, when at the command of a brother steeped in crime he lifted his henchman hand against the life of Geoffry of Anjou: 
                      
                        "Humph! well, I know but little of these things! 
                        'Tis their affair to THINK, and mine to DO; 
                        If this is wrong, HE must defend my soul!" 
                     
                  
                
               It was not long, for either the servant watching in the bed-room or the lover waiting so near, before Lettice Holloway came tripping down the stairs and dashed through the hall-door into the Squire's room. Daintily dressed in a light woolen stuff that seemed to become her jimp little figure quite as well as the plaid gingham-her curls not yet shaken out of the almost prim neatness of their late toilet-and the freshness of morning glistening in eye and blooming on lip,-it is no wonder that Charley Denniston thought, as he sprang up to meet her, that there were worse things in the world than owning, even in prospect, so bewitching an incarnation of girlhood. She had known that he must be the "gentleman" waiting to see her, and no doubt she had paused at the glass and given those saucy curls a passing "sleek" because they were to meet his eyes; and yet when she saw him, she could not hinder a rosy flush, like that of pleased surprise, creeping up to cheek and brow. Then the exclamation, both low-uttered-"My own Letty!" "Charley-how glad I am to see you!" Then two little hands held out, as if that was all that could be given,-and taken by two more and larger hands that only held them for a moment before they crept round the yielding waist and gathered the whole woman into the embrace of happy, permitted affection! 
               Directly, that pair of lovers who did not seem disposed thenceforth to make any secret of their content with each other (how horrified some of the fiances of this day would be at the idea of showing an equal candor!) had accomplished the marvel of sitting down without using more than one chair, though it must be confessed that to that end Charley Denniston was obliged to act as a species of intermediary chair, with a pleasant burthen on his knee, which did not seem to oppress him heavily, and with his arm forming the back as naturally as if it had been made for that especial purpose! Then they fell into low murmured conversation-such words as those meeting for the first time after betrothal might be expected to use-too sacred for this page, and too low-toned, happily, even for the keen ears of the watcher in the bed-room. 
               But very soon, in the confidence of being "all alone," those tones grew more distinct; and after a few moments the young man, with the plump little hand of his destined bride within his own, and toying with it with that hungry fondness which lovers seem to have been occasionally in the habit of showing ever since the days of Troilus and Cressida,-said, his voice low, but strong and earnest: 
               "Lettice, I am going to ask you for a great proof of your entire confidence in me." 
               "What, Charley? another so soon?" was the reply, half playful and half startled. "Do you not quite believe in me yet? oh fie! And what proof can I give you, greater than I gave you when I conquered my own wilful spirit and let myself own that I cared for you?" 
               "I do believe in you, my own Lettice, as I believe in heaven!" said the young man, fervently, and pressing the little hand he held, very close to his heart. "And yet there is one more proof, greater still, that I ask you to give me, and you must do it if you really love me." 
               "Why, you strange fellow!-but you good-looking fellow!" and Lettice stopped in the middle of her sentence, and looked up to him so bewitchingly that he took a kiss in the interval-"what can you mean?" 
               "Be mine, and at once!" 
               "What!" The tone was quick, short, decided and even startled-evoked by what terrible thought, perhaps the young girl herself could scarcely have explained. Before it was fairly uttered she had sprung from her seat and was standing four or five feet from her lover, with her lip trembling and great tears almost ready to well out of the bright dark eyes. 
               "What is the matter, Letty? Come back here!" and Charley Denniston patted his knee as if to reccommend that description of chair as always safe and reliable. And was there ever voice of the fowler-charm of the serpent-like this? We trow not! Lettice Holloway came back again, and as she felt her lover's arm around her, buried her flushed, troubled face in his bosom. 
               "Letty!-dear Letty! What ails you?" 
               "Oh, I don't know!" raising her flushed face and making an attempt to shake back the saucy curls with something of that old freedom which was never to return to the captive. "You said something, Charley, that--" 
               "That pained and distressed you?" Kissing her again, as if that would make up for any amount of pain. "I am sorry, Letty, for I must say it again." 
               "Again?" This time she did not start away from him, but her eyes looked in his face with a kind of beseeching wonder. 
               "Yes. Listen to me for a moment, Letty, and then try to believe that I know what I am saying. I ask you to give me proof of the most unbounded confidence that woman ever placed in man, by doing something strange-something unaccountable until you come to understand it." 
               The great eyes looked at him with still an added wonder, but the lips syllabled no word, and he proceeded: 
               "I am going to take you away from this house, within forty-eight hours, and make you my wife." 
               "Your wife!-so soon?-you-I"-and the voice failed in surprise and agitation, while again she staggered to her feet but did not start away from him as she had done in that moment of blind terror. 
               "Yes-my wife, and so soon. Your father, from the moment he knew that I was-that I was poor,-has refused to allow us to marry while my circumstances remain the same." 
               "I know it!" sadly, and with the head drooped and the fingers clasped low. 
               "I am so placed," the young man went on, "that my circumstances must remain the same, at least for the present, and yet that you must become my wife before they change, if they ever do. Do you understand me, Letty?" 
               "No, I confess that I do not!" the girl answered, very candidly, and lifting her eyes again with something of the old mischief peeping at the corners. "Are you quite sure, Charley, that you understand it yourself?" 
               "Confound it!" was the half muttered exclamation of the unskilful tempter, as he rose from his chair and took a turn or two across the room, musing on the truth of that homely distich which has been very often quoted and yet not often enough for human good: 
                      
                        "Oh, what a tangled web we weave, 
                        When first we practice to deceive!" 
                     
                   He was for the moment powerless and had lost much of the vantage-ground before attained, while Lettice Holloway's pride and the remains of her conquered coquetry had both taken the alarm. 
               "Father forbids my marrying you while you are poor, and you wish me-that is what the thing means, in plain words, I suppose-to run away with you?" 
               "That is what I mean, exactly!" Stopping short before her, and speaking very decidedly. 
               "And I cannot do it-will not do it! I am sorry if my refusal pains you, but I am not in such a hurry as you seem to be, thank you!" 
               "Letty!" and the young man's voice and expression of face were pained-hurt-disappointed. 
               "Oh, don't look so long-faced about it!-I am not going to run away from you, if I do not with you, you impatient fellow!" she reached out her hand, with the word, and took his, both still maintaining their standing position. "Now if I even loved you so much that I was in a hurry to leave everything else in the world and have only you, don't you see that I could not afford to run away, of all the girls you ever saw?" 
               "I? You? No! Why?" 
               "Because they have always called me a 'romp' and a 'coquette,' and what would they say of me when I finished up the whole affair by making a runaway match?" 
               "Humph!-and do you set that, Letty-tell me, now-against the happiness of two whole lives, involved in your doing what I ask?" There was just a little of vexation and disappointment (unreasonable, of course-what man ever was reasonable under such circumstances?) in the tone with which he uttered these words. 
               "No, certainly not, you silly fellow!" was the reply. And then, in a graver and more earnest tone: "I would do anything to make you happy, Charley, to make you permanently happy I mean; and I wish you could believe me." 
               "I can-I do believe you, Letty, as I believe in everything that is good above and below!" and the young man's clasp of the little hand he held ought to have been a sufficient corroboration of his words. 
               "But I do not believe that this would make you happy: I am sure that we should both be doing wrong, and that, after a while, would make us both miserable. You are a proud man, Charley, and your wife, though, she may be a rattle-pate, should have nothing to blush for in her past; and I am too proud, I confess it, to be willing to steal like a thief out of a house where I have been the mistress-honored and happy!" 
               Those were true and weighty words which the young girl was speaking: who could have expected so much calm thoughtfulness to lie under the saucy curls?-and what right had she to call herself a 'rattle-brain' at the very moment when she was thus lecturing the man whom she had selected to be the lord of her life? Charley Denniston felt the weight of those words-under other circumstances he might have recognized their binding force as guides for his own action. Not so, then-he only felt that his task was more difficult than he had anticipated, but that it must be done none the less-that time was flying, interruption might come, and what had not yet been yielded to an unexplained request must be obtained by a more direct appeal to affection and confidence. His face was a little paler than its wont, as he again took both the hands of the young girl in his, as he had held them the moment after entering-looked as steadily as he could into those eyes upraised to his with their blending of undisguised affection and troubled wonder,-and said, in those calm low tones which go to the heart so readily: 
               "Lettice-my own Lettice, listen to me. I ask a strange thing of you, to-day-I know it. Perhaps I have asked it too blindly, and yet I cannot explain more clearly what I mean. Leave this house with me, to-morrow night, become my wife, and you have my word for my will and my ability to shield you from all blame. Refuse, and you may set a bar between us which even I can never again remove while we both live. Would you do that-tell me?" 
               "Oh, no! no!" and the young girl, frightened at the thought, had already crept closer, insensibly. 
               "You have my word, Lettice, that this may be so. You have my word, too, that however poor I may be, I have the means to shield you from want-to keep you in comfort. Now, will you do what I ask-cheerfully, and without asking another question why I take this course?" 
               "Oh, Charley!-do not ask me!-to go away and leave my father-perhaps never to see him again-" 
               "You shall see him again-you shall not be long separated from him." 
               "Why will you torture me so, Charley!" almost sobbed the young girl, really torn apart by the struggle of love, duty, and that sense of propriety which her public life had rather sharpened than blunted. 
               "You hesitate still, then? See here, Lettice Holloway!" Charley Denniston's voice was stern, now, and his face was pale with what might have been hurt feeling, and might only have been determination. Before she could at all imagine what he was about to do, he had rather dragged than led her across the apartment, flung open the door of the parlor and was pointing across to the opposite wall where dimly in the light that came in through the closed blinds showed the picture of her dead mother. "See here!-less than two days ago, in that very presence, you promised to be my wife, whenever and however I should ask you, and you called heaven and your mother to witness that most solemn pledge! Do you hesitate at keeping that promise, already? answer me-Yes or No-here, where you made it!" 
               Perhaps there was something a little threatrical and calculated about this movement: we all play a little, well or ill, at times. But Lettice Holloway saw nothing except the face of the living dead-heard nothing but the repetition of that promise which she had hesitated to fulfill; and the last words were scarcely spoken when she was again in the arms of her lover, her head on his breast, and sobbing out, with all the truth and tenderness which underlay her wild nature: 
               "No-I do not hesitate! You frightened me so, and I have been fighting you again; but I did not mean to do it, and you must to help me remember that you are my master!" 
               "No, Letty-not your master: your lover-your husband!" 
               How that last word sent a new flush to her face, as she went on, pouring out her whole heart in submission to his will: "Take me, when and where you please! I know that you will not ask me to do wrong, for both our sakes. Only be kind to your poor little Letty, who gives up so much for you!" 
               The shower of kisses that rained upon lips, cheeks and eyes at that moment, might have satisfied the girl who so stubbornly but so entirely yielded point by point of her freedom, that she was not likely to be starved for demonstrations of affection, in the new and untried life upon which she was so soon to enter; and perhaps no assurance could have done more to calm and strengthen her in her resolution. Not two minutes had elapsed after this second surrender, when there were mischievous smiles blent with the tears in her eyes, and ripplings of laughter beginning to sound among the sobs just dying away in her voice. The struggle and the fear were over-confidence and trust had supplanted both; and she was already beginning to regard as a pardonable frolic, now that it was inevitably to be done, what had so lately seemed to her little less than a crime! 
               Not more than ten minutes afterwards Charley Denniston left the house of his betrothed, taking the last parting kiss which was ever to be tendered him by his unwedded bride; but before he did so, the strong-armed "help" yet hidden in the bed-room, and who had heard nearly all the preceding conversation, without understanding more of it than that the young people had finally concluded to run away together,-overheard enough in addition, to know that the bridegroom was that day to visit the pastor of the congregation sometimes attended by the Squire's daughter, who lived some five miles away, up the "mill road" leading Northwest to the Stone Mountain spur of the Blue Ridge; that he was to arrange with the minister to receive the runaways and perform the marriage ceremony, at the humble little parsonage, whenever they should arrive; that for the purposes of the escape itself, the bridegroom, "rain or shine" (and there seemed much probability of the former), would be waiting with a close carriage and and a pair of the best horses he could procure, in the lane immediately back of the house, at six o' clock (dusk) on the evening of the next day; that the bridegroom, in order to avoid undue suspicion or the possibility of any of their "last words" being overheard, would not again visit the house before the disappearance; and that when the ceremony should be over and the knot irrevocably tied, the bride should be brought back to her father's house the same evening, to learn her fate at his hands and to avoid any undue fabrication of scandal. A strange arrangement, in some particulars, and yet the strangest points in it much more easily understood by one who has followed the late events of this narration, than they could possibly be guessed by bright but loving and confiding little Lettice Holloway. 
               The expectant lover, gratified but a little blind and dizzy with his success, went his way once more to the "Eagle Tavern," first to think over and then to perfect the necessary arrangements-all easier than the last step had been; the expectant bride stole back up-stairs to the little maiden-chamber which she was so soon to leave forever or to enter with the feeling of beginning a new existence, to smooth her disheveled hair, cool the heat from her flushed face and try to prepare herself for meeting watchful eyes with a mien as light and careless as if no dangerous secret lay heavy at her heart; and the "help" waited, with an anxiety surpassing that with which she kept watch over white-peach preserves at the most critical moment of their cooking, for the coming home of the Squire from the store, and an opportunity to inform him of all the plots and plans which threatened to blow up and annihilate his domestic tranquility. From subsequent events, it would seem that she must have found that opportunity, and been favored with another confidence in return, quite as puzzling and ten times more troublesome. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIII. 
               AN ELOPEMENT IN THE EQUINOX. 
               IF there is any reality whatever in the omen which denounces the chances of happiness of that bride who marries in weather unblessed by the sunshine-then was the day set for the elopement of Lettice Holloway a most unpropitious one. It has already been said that all the meetings and arrangements just recorded took place on the verge of the vernal equinox; and in fact the day set for that culminating event was the veritable twentieth of March-that dark day in the calendar, when the sun, because it "crosses the line," is soused with cold water, pelted with rough winds, and generally treated with the same consideration bestowed upon "greenhorn" sailors when they pay their first visit to the equator. However variable sometimes as to exact date, on this occasion the expected storm, which had been gathering and threatening for days, gave token of an intimate acquaintance with the demands of the almanac, by making its appearance at precisely the proper moment. 
               No reader of this chronicle can fail to remember the events of the previous equinox-that of September. The March crossing of the ecliptic was to witness (thank heaven!) no such gale as that which had on the former occasion desolated the whole sea-coast; but if the winds were in a measure restrained, there was certainly no bound set to their alternate-the waters! The moderate easterly gale inevitable at the season had been for three days covering the sky with clouds so dense that they seemed to hang over the whole earth like a pall; and when the flood-gates were at last opened, as they were at about noon that day, some of the diligent readers of sacred history obtained a more realizing sense of the peculiar surroundings of the Deluge than they were in the habit of enjoying in that latitude. Within an hour after the bursting of the flood, the highways were half overflowed; the fields were soaked like sponges; humanity (except seriously compelled humanity) had disappeared from outdoor view; only here and there a straggling pedestrian and a rarer-straggling vehicle could be seen splashing over the drowned cross-roads: and roofs that had too much of age or too little of paint began to equalize the outer and inner conditions by admitting rain enough for all purposes of irrigation. "A mighty wet arternoon, goin' to rain harder yit!", said the shoremen and small farmers as they gathered under shelter at the stores, the work-shops and the taverns; and three days of incessant heavy rain, varied by fitful gales of more or less severity, were known to be quite as certain as any astronomical or meteorological prediction ever recorded. 
               Such was the afternoon of the twentieth of March; and the night began to close down without other change than the increasing of the easterly gale, the thickening of the clouds, and the descent of more water per hour-if there was really room in the sky for an increase of the pluvial average. All the homeless dogs and all the peripatetic pigs in the section had disappeared, hours before; the ducks had concluded that there could be "too much of a good thing," before sunset, and given up the attempt to swim in all the puddles; nature, about Topsail and the whole county of Seaboard, was taking a fresh water bath, and no one seemed disposed to be in the way of her ablutions. 
               No one-that is to say, no one who could conveniently remain under shelter. Most, who could do so, had finished up their outdoor business for the day or quietly left it unfinished; but some there were who had not found it convenient to do either the one or the other. Certain operations connected with this chronicle, for instance-had been completed; but others remained, equally pressing and difficult. 
               Among the things completed the day before, as promised, had been Charley Denniston's hiring the old close carriage (not a beauty, in any sense, nor yet new, but strong and reasonably comfortable,) belonging to the "livery" of the "Eagle Tavern," with the one pair of really respectable and able horses connected therewith. He should want the conveyance, as he had told the landlord, for at least a couple of days, probably to drive to Clayboro or even further, and would not be back at Topsail before the twenty-first. What he had really done with the "carriage and pair," was comprised in driving up the "mill road" (which we may have present occasion to describe more particularly) to Domine Ryckman's little parsonage, acquainting that ecclesiastic with the true state of affairs, (including his own name and position in the world) and exacting a positive promise to be at home and marry him and his runaway bride the moment they should reach the house on the following evening, as a safeguard against pursuit and possible interruption. This Domine Ryckman, a somewhat jolly and very kindly old Dutch parson, had promised and duly meant to perform, in consideration of the fact that the Squire's daughter would be making a capital marriage, and the other fact that a fifty-dollar bill was to reward his complaisance. This done, the young man had driven on, the same evening, to the next village, two or three miles beyond, and laid himself in wait, with his carriage-and-pair-a sort of land buccaneer, ready at the proper time to dash down from his predal lair and emmulate at least a part of historical example, by carrying off, not by galley but in a species of nondescript conveyance which might well have served for one,-his chosen "Bride of Venice." Perhaps he thought of Squire Holloway, when his loss should be discovered and his child seem to be permanently abducted-playing the part of blind old Dandolo and pursuing in hot haste: perhaps he thought of little else than the bright eyes and beating heart of her who was so soon to be "his own-own Lettice!" 
               So much had been done in that direction: something, too, and of equal importance, had occurred in others. Lettice Holloway had taken advantage of the heavy rain and a headache (the little hypocrite!-if anything about her ached, it was the heart, not the head!) to remain absent all day from the store, and confined most of the time to her own room. Squire Holloway, falling easily into the trap, had been all day at the store and only at the house long enough for a hasty dinner. The powers presiding in the kitchen had been all day boiling, baking and stewing, at their own sweet will, as if the elements in commotion needed to be propitiated by the sacrifice of fowls and the incense of crisping pastries. Rod had been sent, since noon, down to the shop of Major Jeff Taddlewick, to tell him, mysteriously, that "the Squire thought he had discovered a clue to what they were looking for," and to beg him not to remain away from the shop, for any length of time, towards night, as he might be wanted at a moment's notice. The Major had strutted, looked conscious and pompous, and promised to hold himself in readiness. Two other events had occurred, during the day, and both in connection with Squire Holloway's locomotary arrangements. The first that he had, unaccountably enough, sent his only close carriage to the wheel-wright at a mile distance, and caused his old gig, a most curious open contrivance for two horses, a dozen years old and hung upon jacks which nearly threw out the rider at every lurch on a rough road,-to be extricated from its honorable retirement of old age as a hen-roost in the back end of the wagon-house. The second that one of his farm-hands, after some minutes of private conference with the Squire in his office, had mounted a horse and ridden away up the "mill road," in the heaviest rain of the afternoon. Finally, and to close all-the Squire himself had been seized with sudden illness, not of a very serious character but sufficient to confine him within-doors, late in the afternoon, and without any prospect of immediate recovery. 
               So much had occurred, to and in connection with the persons prominently figuring in this relation, during the twenty-four hours preceding the undeniably stormy night which closed down upon Topsail and its neighborhood on the twentieth of March. And now, somewhat briefly and hurriedly-to the important events which followed. 
               At dusk, in the pelting rain and the driving wind, a covered carriage, with the horses half drowned, the driver almost invisible beneath a tarpaulin and a multiplicity of old coats, and the water beating and pouring in at every crevice in the curtains,-might have been seen dashing down the road leading into Topsail from the North-westward, turning down a side road and drawing up in a narrow lane running behind Squire Holloway's garden and out-buildings, just where a gate, opening from the garden, gave easy access to it (in ordinary times) from the back of the house. The carriage contained one occupant, who before he became a matrimonial conspirator and fell into bad practices on that account, had been the handsome Charley Denniston. He was not handsome, now, for he had been out in the rain and expected to be possibly out in it still more-had borrowed a thicker and much older overcoat than his own, with an antique slouched hat, and looked (so far as he could be seen through the dusk inside the dilapidated conveyance) much more picturesque than fashionable. But if the outside was uninviting, had he not a treasure in inward feelings?-for was not the young man outwitting that "old curmudgeon" the Squire, satisfying the most persistent doubts of his father, carrying on one of the necessary operations of circulating library romance, and just on the point of being rewarded with the undisputed possession of that flashing gem and radiant flower in the crown and bouquet of all womanhood-pretty Lettice Holloway? She had given her promise, and he knew that she would keep the appointment (however damply); his arrangements had been made with such secrecy that discovery and pursuit were almost impossible; and so he sat and waited in comparative calmness for the sound of the little feet splashing through the wet garden and varying the sough of the wind and the heavy patter of the rain. 
               At dusk, within the house of Squire Holloway, a companion picture to that within the lane was presented. Before the little glass in her white curtained chamber of maidenhood, by the light of a single candle flaring in the wind on the bureau-Lettice Holloway was arraying herself for her flight. Shedding tears as she dressed-alike at the thought of doing for lover's sake what might seriously displease the father whom she loved so well, and at the remembrance upon what a turning point of woman's life she stood. And yet smiling through those tears, as she saw in the glass her pretty face and the bewitching curls which framed it-realized that there was really some merriment in the idea of running away through such a storm to be married-wondered whether her father, so fond of pranks himself, would not be the more easily disposed to forgive hers-and thought how "Charley" must laugh when he saw what a gipsy she was making herself in honor of the equinox. Such a bridal attire was certainly somewhat astonishing. A tight boddice and short skirt of rose-colored merino, with plain little collar and cuffs and without a suspicion of jewelry to relieve it,-was being covered with a heavy hooded cloak of homespun, brown and a little threadbare with use by one and another for a dozen years; and when the toilet was nearly conpleted the great hood of this garments, large enough to cover an entire bonnet, was thrown over the clustering curls and pinned down under the chin, making the face that peeped out a mixture of gipsy girl, runaway nun disguised as a monk, and Little Red Riding Hood. Beneath the stout skirt and the bottom of the cloak peeped (also in honor of the equinox) heavy ribbed hose of spotless white wool, terminating in the little feet cased in unromantic stout shoes, with soles thick enough to defy even the soaked ground of that March night. An odd-looking little baggage, just then, beyond a question; and yet not much for "Charley" to laugh at, if he could at the same moment have caught a glimpse of his own sartorial surroundings!" 
               Very soon was this array made complete; and then the young girl, taking another and a last look around the resting-place of her maiden freedom, took the candle in her hand, closed the door that she might never again be allowed to open, and tripped down the stairs as lightly as those heavy shoes would allow. She was not a little nervous and timid, of course, under the idea that she might be met and questioned as to her motive for going out on such a terrible night, by some member of the domestic household; but it must be confessed that frank little Lettice was by that time far enough advanced on the road of falsehood to have a story all ready for such a contretemps-that "Emily Smith was sick-she was just going to step over to Mrs. Smith's and would be back before bedtime." 
               But no such interruption was experienced-if she was really doing wrong, the malevolent powers seemed disposed to give her full opportunity. No one in her father's room, where the fire-light played on the furniture, and where a tear dropped and was sobbingly dashed away as she saw the Squire's arm-chair and thought that perhaps henceforth, out of anger towards her, he might sit lonely there. Ah, those are things to think of, daughters who allow the son of the stranger to come between you and the hearts that have loved you so long-but to think of when no irrevocable step has been taken, not when the promise has been made and the garments of flight have been donned! 
               The young girl's hand was upon the door of the parlor, through which and another room she must pass to reach the back door of the main building, the mode of egress safest from observation. She opened it and passed in, candle in hand. Had Lettice Holloway been fleeing away from her home to the embrace of guilt and shame, she would unquestionably have paused at that moment and dashed away from her the garments of her temptation-as she saw the sad, sweet face of her dead mother looking down upon her from the wall. Not so, now-she was flying to no guilt: in that very presence the pledge had been given which gave her a right to flee, the wide world over, to him; and though the candle shook in the ungloved little hand and sobs burst from her bosom at the thought that she might even be shut away from that dear presence in the future,-yet the brave little heart did not falter for one moment in its determination. She did bend down upon one knee, as she might have done before some shrined saint, and she did sob audibly as she spoke these words: 
               "Forgive me, mother, that I seem to be going away from you, and ask my father to forgive me! I cannot help it, mother!-he calls me, and what can I do but go? I think you would not blame me if you were here, mother. Ask my father to let me come back to him and to you-dear, dear mother!" 
               Then Lettice Holloway rose, brushed away the tears from her eyes and seemed to compel back the sob in her throat. She passed through the door from the parlor into the rear room, unlocked that leading into the garden, blew out the candle and left it on a chair, closed the door and went out into the garden, the night and the storm. Through the wet garden, to see the carriage standing in the dusky lane beyond, and to feel that "Charley" was true and punctual. Through the gate into the lane, to have him spring from the vehicle as he caught the first glimpse of her already dripping figure, and say sweet love-words in a low voice that seemed to blend sorrow for her exposure with gratitude for her trust;-to be lifted in, and wrapped as carefully as possible, and sustained by that arm which made the very best of backs to a seat as it had before done to a chair; to be thanked, and petted, and caressed, and driven away with, out of the little lane and splashing away up the "mill road," at all the speed of which the tavern horses were capable; as if the theft were one of precious property and all the constables in the county might be in chase-or as if one royal princess of the olden time was being spirited away by a daring noble, with all the chivalry of her father's kingdom spurring in mad pursuit. Neither of those, precisely; and yet a hot pursuit there was to be, of quite as remarkable a character as any named in history-to which attention must now for a little time be exclusively directed. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIV. 
               THE CATASTROPHE OF THE MILL ROAD. 
               DUSK on the office of Squire Holloway, where that model official was sitting, not only "indisposed" but alone. The inevitable Rod was not present, and his stool seemed to be lonely without him. His last novel, only one third devoured, lay disconsolately open at an early page-evidencing that the young man must have been called away on very urgent business. There was a candle lighted on the Squire's desk, but it seemed to be devoted much more to purposes of pleasure than those of business, as the smoker, with body in one chair and feet on another, occasionally stuck the half-lighted end of his cigar into the flame and renewed its fire. Then he would replace the cigar in his mouth, smoke away, rub his hands and chuckle, apparently in blissful ignorance how the two young conspirators were outwitting him. Once in a while a low "Ha! ha!" would break out from his lips, and his whole frame would shake with merriment; and once he muttered, as if himself was good company and he had no objection to hold a short conversation with it: 
               "Oh, by Jupiter!-this is too good-too good altogether! Such a rain nobody ever saw, and it must have come on purpose! I only hope they won't back out-the young fools! But no-no danger of that: stop a duck flying to water, won't you? And my friend who want's to 'go through fire and water' to serve me-ha! ha! ho! ho!-just see if I don't accommodate him! Hallo! Well, what is it?" 
               The latter exclamation was apparently caused by the sudden apparition of Rod, the wearer of a dripping tarpaulin hat too large for him, and of tarpaulin coat and overalls, also too large and equally dripping, but with a broad grin on his face, which took away all thought from his raiment. Evidently, from the appearance of his countenance, he was in the height of human felicity; and had his awful employer not beer present, and had the tarpaulins presented no insuperable obstacle to such an exercise, there is no doubt that he would then and there have gone around the room on his hands and feet, like a wheel propelled on its spokes, and ended by standing on his head with his biforcates extended for applause. But the Squire's "Well, what is it?" somewhat recalled him to himself, and he answered at once. 
               "They're off!-they're gone! oh, isn't it jolly! Seen Miss Lettice go out of the back door, through the garden, and he put her into the carriage, back there in the lane, and away they went!" 
               "Bravo, Rod!" said the Squire. "Everything is working finely, and if you do as I have told you, you shall have a whole month this summer and an extra new suit of clothes next Christmas." 
               "Oh, I'll do it!" answered the young reprobate-"that is, if you think there won't be any danger." 
               "Danger?-danger to what?-to your own rotten neck?" enquired the employer. 
               "Oh, no!" disclaimed Rod-"it was only him that I was thinking of." 
                
               "You just do as I have told you," answered the Squire," and if there's any murder and anybody is to be hung for it, I'll be hung in your stead. If I was only a little younger, I'd go in your place, you young rascal, and be glad of the chance! You know the road, and I needn't tell you another word. Only jump quick, and see that the rope is right and that the bolt works easy. If you do as I have ordered, I will see that you have all that I have promised: if you come back without doing it, by Jupiter I'll skin you alive and then set you adrift without a penny afterwards! Now run down to the store-whisper to Tom to hurry down and tell the Major that I am sick and want him to come up here just as quick as he can; and while he is gone, get out the gig and have it down there at the door. The moment he comes down, after talking with me, let us see what you are good for! Off with you!" 
               Away went Rod, out of the office and down the stairs, still leaving a trail of water behind him at every step. In a moment afterwards one of the Squire's farm hands was splashing hurriedly down the street towards Major Jeff Taddlewick's; and it did not seem more than ten minutes afterwards-certainly not a quarter of an hour-when the military cobbler, who had been, so to speak, under arms for hours and waiting for the bugle call, burst into the office, dripping a little, in his best over-coat and a pair of his own long-boots reaching to the thighs, but his Roman nose displaying eagerness for any deed of high emprise that might chance to offer, and his whole appearance that of an incarnated active benevolence. 
               He found the Squire still alone, but very ill-writhing with agony under an attack of cramp-in-the-stomach, and mingling his groans of pain and the sippings of whiskey-and-water from a tumbler at his side, by which he was apparently trying to moderate them,-with moans over the depravity of human nature and that thanklessness of children which one William Shakspeare declares to be worse than the dental incisions of the most venomous of serpents. When he saw the Major he made a convulsive attempt to spring up and grasp him by the hand, but fell back, groaning with pain, and it was only by the nearer advance of the visitor that the friendly greeting was accomplished. 
               "Oh, Major, I am so glad that you came immediately!" he managed to utter, between the writhings of pain. "My wretched daughter has run away, as you warned me, with that scoundrelly New Yorker." 
               The Major took the advantage of a severe spasm, which stopped the Squire's breath for a moment-to remark that he was generally in the habit of being correct in his information! 
               "Of course you are!" asserted the Squire still brokenly and at intervals-"of course you are! And you shall find, Major Taddlewick, that I am not ungrateful for the very great kindness you have done in giving me a hint of what was going on. I have not been able to prevent their plans being carried out, so far; but through the hints you so kindly gave me I have succeeded in discovering what has been done and where they have gone." 
               "What?-where?" asked the Major, all ears for the dreadful intelligence. 
               "They got away with a carriage, only a few moments ago," groaned the sufferer, "and I am confident, from what I hear, that the fortune-hunting scoundrel has taken her away to Domine Ryckman's and intends to marry her there before he can be caught! Oh, if I was only well enough to follow them!" 
               "I will follow them!" loudly proclaimed the Major, who in the excitement of such a prospect of brillaint meddling no doubt forgot the pouring rain. 
               "You will-my friend-I know that you will!" said the Squire, again grasping his hand. "That was why I sent for you, the moment I discovered their flight. I have no one else to depend upon, and I knew that you would not fail me!" 
               "But how shall I go?-have you any carriage ready-If they are not soon followed they will be married before they can be caught, and that will be bad, you know!" very reasonably suggested the friend. 
               "Oh, I have thought of all that," groaned the Squire. "My carriage is broken and being mended; but when I sent for you I told Rod to get out the gig, with two horses; and no doubt he is by this time waiting for you. Do hurry, Major, do, before it is too late!" 
               "The gig? It has no top, has it?-and oh Lord how it rains!" remarked the Major. 
               "No, it has no top, and I believe that it does rain," assented the Squire. "But oh, Major, you can take an umbrella, and you certainly would not think of a little rain when the happiness of a friend was involved!" 
               "No, certainly I would not!" pompously answered the Major, straightening himself up. "I am ready!-and see if I don't overhaul'em, if there is anything in horseflesh! But stop-what can I do when I do catch 'em? I have no authority, you know." 
               "Yes, you have!-here it is!-I thought of that and wrote the warrant while Tom was gone down for you and before that last spasm came on. My daughter is under age, and I can arrest the scoundrel for stealing her clothes, which are not hers, but mine. See here!-read this, and then for heaven's sake hurry away and arrest the scamp where-ever you can lay hands upon him. I appoint you a special constable for that purpose." 
               The Major took the paper which the Squire handed, and which it is unnecessary to say had been all day prepared, and rapidly ran his eye over the following: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           Warrant. 
                           
                              STATE OF --, Seaboard County, ss. 
                              To the Sheriff or any Constable of said County.
                            
                           Whereas complaint hath this day been made to me, one of the Justices of the Peace of the County of Seaboard, on oath by Roderick Bates, that one Charles Denniston, of the City of New York, has this day stolen and carried off from the custody and possession of one William Holloway, of the township of Topsail, in the County of Seaboard, one merino dress, one cloak, shoes, stockings, handkerchiefs and other property, of more than the value of ten dollars, belonging to the said William Holloway, these are therefore, in the name of the State of --, to authorize and require you to apprehend the said Charles Denniston, if in your county he may be found, and bring him forthwith before me, or some other Justice of the Peace in and for said county, to answer the said complaint and be further dealt with as the law directs; and hereof fail not, and this shall be your warrant. 
                           Given under my hand and seal, at my office in the township of Topsail, in said county, this twentieth day of March in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and --. 
                           
                              WILLIAM HOLLOWAY, Justice of the Peace.
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "That is just the thing!-I'll have him if he is in the county!" loudly proclaimed the Major, who in the sudden possession of legal power felt almost as much prowess as proverbially belongs to a new policeman when he goes on patrol for the first time. "Look out for 'em, Squire!-I'll have 'em back to the house before bed-time-you can bet on me!" 
               "I shall never be able to thank you, Major, but pray do hurry!" groaned the Squire, in another writhe of pain. "Rod will be waiting for you at the corner of the store, and don't forget to take an umbrella." 
               By the time this last admonition was uttered, Major Jeff Taddlewick had cleared the office and was descending the stairs. Passing through the store, he grasped the first umbrella at hand, which chanced to be that of a shoreman who sent a growled curse after him,-plunged out of the door and down the stoop, to find Rod indeed waiting for him, with two horses harnessed before the open gig and himself duly installed as driver. He clambered into the vacant seat as rapidly as possible, to find that all that portion of the old leathern cushion unoccupied by the driver was soaked like a sponge and with a cool little pool of water in the middle. But what was that to a man entrusted with so important a mission and at the same time enabled to satisfy an envy and a curiosity? Nothing-literally nothing. The Major sat down in the pool, and Rod, plying his whip, dashed away in the direction of the "mill road," the old gig leaping as if it would spring from its jacks, and the mud and water splashing upwards and over them, only less liberally than the rain poured down from the overflowing heavens. 
               When the "special constable" was gone, Squire Holloway suddenly recovered from his severe attack, but he was immediately prostrated by another scarcely less severe. If he groaned no longer, he laughed-oh. how that man laughed, lying back in his chair and shaking his portly person as if the joke was altogether too good for any one human body to contain. 
               "Oh, oh! this is the very best thing that I ever saw in all my life!" he alternately muttered and snorted. "Now if that young scoundrel, Rod, only does his duty, there'll be sport enough in Topsail to last for a twelvemonth! And only think-if he doesn't, and by any chance that meddling fool does catch the two other fools, I shall have Letty and her husband before me on a charge of stealing! Oh, Lord, it is too good-too good, altogether!" as a safeguard against any injury from which state of affairs, the Squire lit another cigar and blurted out little dashes of laughter through the smoke, like a jolly good-natured old fiend. 
               If Major Jeff Taddlewick had temporarily forgotten the state of the atmosphere, when he made tender of personally following the fugitives, there is no doubt whatever that the fact was fully called to his recollection before the vehicle had splashed and whirled along more than half a mile. There was a young moon hidden away somewhere behind the thick banks of cloud, so that though the darkness was almost too dense to see the road at all, yet that point was not quite reached, and the glimmer of water and the loom of ruts and fences could be caught occasionally and with bewildering uncertainty. The wind blew with just sufficient force to make the carrying of an umbrella impossible or to turn it inside-out once in two minutes; and the rain came down with that dashing, sweeping, pouring force which is sometimes exhibited under a gutter during a heavy shower, or under an upper window in a doubtful neighborhood when the slops are being thrown into that general sewer, the street. It did not seem to come down in drops, but by great whirling bucketsful, soaking through cloth at a single dash and forming rivulets of ice-cold water down the back in a manner which would have been enrapturing to a hydropathist. Long before that half mile had been covered, the Major had abandoned any hope of going home with one dry thread upon his person, the soppy cushion below seemed to answer to the leaky heavens above, his long boots began to fill with the surplus moisture that ran down from his clothing, and he commenced to experience that soaked and chilly feeling which a long-expatriated bull-frog is supposed to enjoy for a time after return to his native element, It is not too much to say that already, within that period, the Major came very near to wishing that he had never communicated his suspicions to the Squire at all, or that, at least, he had shown sense enough to decline engaging in any such damp pursuit. But the warrant in his pocket (it must have been somewhat affected by that time!) and the esprit du corps of a member of the organised band of general meddlers, both tended to sustain his sinking spirits; and there was one consoling thought, which he no doubt laid to his soul with great satisfaction-that he might as well go on as turn back, as he could not possibly be any wetter than he was!
                
               Rod, by no means an unskillful driver and apparently delighted to have the liberty of the reins at any price, proved himself, meanwhile, a veritable son of Jehu, and drove as if speed was everything and horseflesh of no consequence whatever. With just glimmering of light enough to discern some shadow of the road, he plied the whip and whirled along, sometimes on a swinging trot and sometimes on a gallop, the wheels of the old gig sinking down into one of the rut-holes made by the spring thaw, and coming out again, with equal easy rapidity; and the body, with the two other bodies, swaying and jerking about in such a manner as to leave serious doubts whether it would not be lying in a heap of fragments within the next half-minute. It has before been intimated that the Major was timid as to his bodily safety; and more than once, when it seemed too dark and the motion of the old gig threatened total dissolution too inevitably-he suggested to Rod that "they had better slack up a little," "there was no such hurry as that," and other intimations calculated to abate the ardor of that juvenile who seemed to have the family honor so much at heart. But as those remonstrances were only met by the reply that "the old man told him to go as fast as he could, and he'd be darned if he didn't mean to do it!" accompanied by renewed cuts of the whip and shoutings of "G'lang!" to the horses,-the Major at last desisted and sank back into his seat (when he was allowed to remain in it) with a mixture of silent rage, despair and horror. 
               At some three miles from Topsail the road made a sudden descent of a little gravelled knoll, and immediately afterwards swept under a line of heavy trees and came out on the shelving sandy bank or beach of a mill-pond, at the left, on the other side of which a sawmill could be discerned in daylight, the spot giving to that particular highway the name which has before been applied to it-that of the "Mill road." The track ran along at the top of the bank, while just below it the sand shelved away suddenly towards the water. At ordinary times there could not have been more than a foot of depth, fifteen or twenty feet from the road; but already the heavy rain had begun to tell on the brooks, the dark, muddy water, with only enough of the invariable night-gleam to tell of its presence, was within two or three feet of the ruts, and six feet beyond there was a bathing depth of not less than four or five feet. 
               Master Rod, who, as driver, sat upon the right of the vehicle, descended the slight knoll, on that occasion, at a rate of speed which made the Major shiver additionally in his long boots. When they swept under the dark trees he had not succeeded in checking their speed; and as they came out at the edge of the water they became apparently a little unmanageable, shied down to the left, out of the road, and on the shelving bank, so that the driver, in drawing them suddenly round to the right, imparted to the old gig an amount of centrifugal force of which he was of course not aware, and while the horses broke loose and dragged him away (at least that was the appearance) at their heels, the gig itself, with its remaining passenger, pitched violently over, down the bank and into the pond,-the passenger, as being highest from the earth, naturally going fartherest and landing in deepest water. 
               It was a sad catastrophe-accidental as it seemed: a sudden and fatal interruption in a career which promised so much! Major Jeff Taddlewick fell, unhurt except as to his feelings and one or two slight scratches, into some four or five feet of water, where he strangled, sputtered, swore unintelligibly, and finally scrambled out and ashore, at least fully aware that he could be wetter than he had been when in the vehicle, and uttering imprecations on the boy, the gig, the horses, Squire Holloway, his daughter, the man who had run away with her, the minister who was expected to marry them, and everybody else, individually and collectively, to a degree which must have unburthened his mind if it did not improve his temper. He called aloud to Rod, when he had circumnavigated the remains of the gig and reached the bank,-but received no answer; and there is no doubt that he derived a certain diabolical consolation from the remembrance that the boy had probably been dragged away and killed by the horses. He might not have mused even so calmly as he did on the mill-pond bank, or gone trudging through the mud and the rain, on his way back, to Topsail without any nearer approach to the absolute craziness of impotent anger,-could he have seen the dexterity with which Rod, at the moment of the catastrophe, jerked up the rope which had been skillfully attached to the bolt that held the swingle-trees, and himself leaped over the side of the gig to the ground, with his horses safely in hand. And it is just possible that he would have gone back to the pond and rid humanity of a pest by drowning himself, if he could only have heard the diabolical chuckle of laughter vented by the young reprobate while he was himself floundering in the water,-or known that at that moment he was riding back to Topsail, astride of one of the horses and leading the other, with the happy consciousness in his heart of an important duty well performed, and by turns chuckling and whistling defiance, under his misfitting oil-cloth suit, to all the north-easters that ever blew over the coast of Seaboard. 
             
             
               CHAPTER 
                     XXXI.
                     XXXV.
                  
                
               EXIT LETTICE HOLLOWAY. 
               UNDER other circumstances than those existing, Charley Denniston, too, might have found the ride from Topsail, up the "Mill road," in the direction of Domin Ryckman's, the very reverse of pleasant. For the road was certainly rough and "jolty" to a most painful degree; and in the almost total darkness the driver, going at all the speed of which his horses were well capable, could not be expected to know the existence of a hole in the rut, until, like traditional Patrick with the pond in his friend's garden, he discovered it by tumbling into it and crawling out again. So that there was a recurrence of peculiar sensations in the ride, very much like those which one would expect to experience if put into a bag with several others, and shaken up and occasionally bumped down upon the floor, by some Brobdignagian individual to whom he bore the relative size of a rat or a squirrel to humanity. Then the carriage had been, to say the least, constructed several years before; and the leathern cushions, not having been re-stuffed since that time, had something of the same elasticity of surface displayed by one padded with burned bricks, rendering the descent upon them, from the jolts, solid if not particularly agreeable. Then it was dark enough, and the road seemed uncertain enough, to make a little nervousness as to the result of such blind speed, easily pardonable. Then it rained (though that fact may before have been indicated) with a freedom which reflected the highest credit upon the pluvial capacities of the coast region; and though the occupants of the carriage sat well back in it, and they were going before the storm instead of facing it, sudden gusts of wind would persist in dashing great masses of water in between the half-buttoned and flapping curtains; and the rain would persist in finding rents and fissures in the wood of the roof, through which it fell in drips and streams and ran down a shivering back or plashed into an eye at the most awkward of moments. 
               These were certainly discomforts; and yet what were they, really, to the flying lovers? Each had something more to think of than he mere question of being dry or damp, jolted or left at ease, for a ride of five miles. The journey of a whole life was before them: how was that to prosper and end? Let us do them the justice to say that neither doubted the other, for one moment; had there existed any less degree of perfect confidence than this, they might better have allowed themselves to be tumbled off the dam into the mill pond of the Major's catastrophe, where the stream was deepest and help least likely-than ridden on to a worse plunge and a living death! If either had a doubt, it was with reference to the reception of that night's work by the parent of each-by the two fathers who had alone been spared them. Would the New York merchant be thoroughly satisfied of the unmercenary character of his forced daughter-in-law?-would the bluff and jolly old Squire quite forgive the daughter and the lover who had touched him in a tender point by outwitting him? And yet we fancy that both the fugitives answered the puzzling questions in the favorable affirmative; for certainly neither had any more idea of drawing back from the runaway marital experiment than of permanently abandoning each other and allowing some one else to step into the place that each coveted. 
               As to the discomforts of the journey-the fact is that they were relative and modified by other surroundings. The roughness of the road made it necessary that Charley Denniston should support and steady his fellow passenger, which he could only do by holding his arm so tightly around her waist that he seemed to come into premature possession of his coveted domain; and the constant irruptions of the water from above and below, made certain shakings, and foldings, and gatherings up, and brushings away, imperatively necessary, which enabled him to pet the dear girl to his heart's content without seeming to be ridiculous in his manifestations. And as he gave, we may believe that Lettice Holloway received. She was demonstrating to him the love of a life: he could not too surely demonstrate to her how his true soul went out in protection to meet that confidence. So when the arm came round her and gathered her close, her whole heart was gathered with it; her head of hidden curls lay upon his broad breast with a feeling of drowsy and yet sleepless happiness that she would scarcely have exchanged for any sharper agony of rapture; and when, blending with the roar of the storm and the plash of the falling rain she heard his low love-words, calling her his own "own-own Letty," his "dear, true-hearted girl," and his "bonny bride,"-lip answered lip in words as well as caresses. Both were young, merry, even mischievous; but there was no badinage between them then-no mischief-no light word: each would have felt that anything more or less than sober, loving earnest at that crisis in life, might give the other cause to doubt the surrender of the whole heart, soul and being into the venture. 
               And so they rode on, scarcely conscious of the time consumed or the distance travelled, and so sure of an undiscovered escape that they took no thought of any immediate pursuit,-until the driver, whirling the old carriage suddenly around where a dim light came out upon the road from a couple of cottage windows, brought up his reeking horses with a sharp "Whoa!" and "Here we are!" and they found themselves at the gate of the little parsonage. 
               Then was the proper time, of course, for Lettice Holloway to have begun wavering and shrinking, with symptoms of fainting, and some difficulty in being removed from the carriage. But unfortunately the little girl did not understand all the "proprieties." It was her first time of running away to be married, and she could not be expected to understand all about it-as Major Lally, of the French Revolution, navely remarked when called upon to lay down his head on the block of the guillotine! So instead of giving way as the awful moment approached, the instant that she found herself no longer alone with "Charley," the merry, self-reliant girl came back again, and she sprung from the ricketty vehicle, into his arms and to the ground, with the vigor and readiness of a woman thoroughly alive and awake. 
               Domin Ryckman, as he heard the expected carriage, had come down the path to the gate, and was waiting to receive the run-aways,-enveloped in a shovel hat and huge cloak, and bearing an umbrella of such size that it might have been intended for a family promenade during the California rainy-sea-son. 
               "Ah, good evening, Domine-hope we have not kept you waiting long in the rain!" was the salutation of the expectant bridegroom, as he recognized the waiting figure. 
               "Good evening, Mr. Denniston-no, I only came out as I heard the carriage. And this is Miss Holloway I suppose-so muffled up that my old eyes would not know her. Well, hurry along with me into the house, children, and dry yourselves, for you must be very wet-such a dreadful night! And you, driver-drive round the corner, there, under the shed, and fasten your horses." 
               Almost before they were fairly cognizant that they had quitted the carriage, the runaway couple had followed the old Domine up the short walk, under its bowering trees and vines that now dripped rain at every touch-up the piazza steps of the low-roofed little parsonage that stood with its gable to the road,-and were ushered through the front door and into the parlor or "best room" of the house, where two big wax-candles made a perfect illumination from the mantel, while a fire of blazing oak in the Franklin shed a grateful warmth into the room and flickering rays over the sad-colored carpet, the sober furniture, and the plain white walls decorated with a framed sampler indicative of a bygone idle girlhood, and two or three neatly mounted engravings on Scriptural subjects. 
               "Now excuse me for a few minutes, young people, and dry yourselves before the fire, while I throw off these wet garments," said the old Domine, about leaving the room. Then he paused at the threshold, looked with a benevolent smile at the couple taking his advice and standing side by side before the fire, and added: "Bless your dear hearts!-I have no doubt that you feel in a hurry; but the night is a very bad one, and I really don't believe that any one has been so cruel as to follow you. Mrs. Ryckman will come in to see you, in a moment or two; and make yourselves as comfortable as you can, while you are waiting." 
               The old man, with his tall, broad figure, a little bent by time, his benevolent face, his dark garments with the knee-breeches of a past day yet preserved, and his long white hair reaching almost to his shoulders,-passed through the door leading to the commoner rooms of the house; and the "young people" were for the moment again alone. 
               "You are almost mine, now, Lettice: a few moments will make you mine beyond the power of anything but death to take away!" said the happy but bewildered fellow, in that stolen moment of privacy, and with something of the feeling of the man unused to much wealth, who counts over his gold every few minutes, for fear it may suddenly take to itself wings. "Almost mine!-are you afraid, sorry, agitated-little one?" 
               "Afraid or agitated? No!-I am nearer to laughing than crying," replied the young girl, with a flash of her old merriment, and her face, from which the enveloping hood had been removed, turning up with a bewitching struggle between the two emotions imprinted upon it. "I almost think, Charley, that running away to be married is capital fun after all, and when I get married again I do not know but I shall arrange it in the same way!" 
               But just then the conversation closed, with the coming in of Mrs. Ryckman, all ribboned evening-cap and Sunday gown, with her round face redolent of smiles that reached all the way up to the streak of gray hair that crowned her brow, and the dumpling figure speaking of a life of content if not of idleness. She curtsied low to the expectant bridegroom, then took the curly head of Lettice (who was an old acquaintance) between both hands and kissed her on the forehead, disrobed the young girl of her cloak, saw that the overcoat and hat of Charley Denniston were duly deposited on a chair at the back of the room; and by that time the Domine himself, with his gown and bands, stood before the betrothed couple, two curt- seying hobbedehoy girl-grandchildren coming in to act as witnesses and make the room less lonely, and the half-open door leading into the kitchen giving an opportunity for the few domestics of the household to see and hear that interesting ceremony which never seems to pall upon the general curiosity. 
               And so Charley Denniston and Lettice Holloway stood up side by side before the holy man, typifying that walk together, physically and morally, which they were swearing to tread through life. Strangely attired, both, for a bridal occasion; and yet the handsome bridegroom, in his neat dark travelling clothes, and boots only a little splashed with the mud of his journey, seemed as if any change in costume could only have been for the worse; while pretty Lettice, her saucy curls only a little in confusion, her cheeks flushed slightly with the novelty of her situation, and the trim ancle and shapely foot peeping out below her rose merino, giving her something of the air of the Roman cantadina in holiday dress,-pretty Lettice could have borrowed no added grace from white robe and bridal veil. They were, indeed, a strikingly handsome couple-so handsome that good old Mrs. Ryckman could not avoid exclaiming, just as the Domin adjusted his specs and began the solemn service: "Bless their dear hearts!-they ought to be married, for they are both as pretty as pictures!" 
               A few words-how very few they seemed!-that simple and beautiful marriage-service of the Reformed Dutch Church, which has bound so many for good or ill since the day of the Synod of Dort in Holland. A few words, a brief prayer, a joining of hands, a few responses, whispered low yet heard beyond the stars. Then another brief prayer, and the solemn words concluding: "In the presence of God and of these people as witness, I pronounce you man and wife: and what God both joined together let not man put asunder;" The deed so brief-so momentous-was done: the two so lately free were free no longer: a union had been cemented, that in its truth and purity might make the very angels of heaven smile with an added joy-that in its falsehood and the crime it must so engender, might give a new howl of demoniac triumph to the lips of the fallen in outer darkness! 
               Poor little Lettice!-she had borne the banner of womanhood bravely through the moment of trial; but when that moment was past-when the doom for which she was so well prepared had come beyond recall,-then nature asserted its prerogative, the room seemed to swim round with her, the voices of friends, their kisses and congratulations, came to her as through a mist, and it was only as her husband caught her to him and assisted her to a chair that she was saved from exhibiting the crowning evidence of woman's weakness. She was saved from fainting, however: the mists rolled away; and in a few moments afterwards she shared, with a recovering laugh, in the glass of old Medeira and the slice of cake which the Domine's wife brought forward as a necessary accompaniment of such occasions. 
               The ceremony over, the Domin had thrown aside his gown; and just then his benevolent old face began to be crossed and rippled over with smiles that seemed difficult to keep within bounds. Then the face of the old lady caught the reflection, and smiles played over her fat cheeks, while she shook her finger at the Domin, and called him, as she might have done fifty years before, a "naughty old boy!" Then the two female youngsters, who had taken the customary kiss of both bride and bridegroom, began laughing more openly and at last ran out of the room to indulge their mirth without restraint. There was evidently something mirth-provoking in the minds of the good people at the parsonage; and if Lettice Holloway did not become aware of the fact, Charley Denniston did, with the very least heightening of color in consequence. There might be something remarkably droll about his marriage, but all that drollery was not transparent; and the merchant's son, who paid fifty dollars for only a few minutes of clerical function, perhaps not unnaturally felt that he was entitled to be treated, throughout, with the gravest consideration. 
               But if he was in a maze for the moment, he was to be enlightened in a most extraordinary manner. For very soon after the exodus of the grand-children from the room, the old Domine stepped out to the kitchen and returned with a folded letter, which he presented to the bridegroom, commanding his face remarkably well under the circumstances. On the outside the missive was addressed to "Mr. Charles Denniston," in a hand which he did not recognize; but when he broke the seal and saw within, be certainly did recognize the hand and all the information sought to be conveyed. He read, blushed, laughed, then said something that sounded very much like smothered swearing, and at last plumped himself into a chair with the air of a man thoroughly beaten out, and held over the letter to his new-made wife, with the words: 
               "There is something for us both, Lettice, dear! Read it!" 
               Lettice Denniston (Lettice Holloway no more!) did read the missive, and it affected her; but the effect was very different from that produced upon her husband. She dropped it upon the floor, after a single reading, clapped her hands to her side, and went off into such a convulsion of hearty, ringing laughter as sounded through the whole house like a chime of bells and eventually threatened her personal health much more seriously than the agitation of the ceremony had done. The young husband fell also into laughter, by degrees, borne away much more by the memory of the time when he had first heard that merry peal, on the stoop of the store at Topsail-than by any recognition of a jest which told so heavily against himself; and the Domine and his wife, thus delivered from restraint, supplied all the remaining parts to a laughing chorus such as had seldom sounded through the sober parlor of a Dutch parsonage. 
               Mean while, what was the strange missive which had turned the pensive sobriety of the bridal hour into such unrestrained merriment, with faces flushing and sides aching? This,-nothing more or less, brought to the parsonage about two hours before by the Squire's farm-hand who had galloped away so hurriedly up the "mill road" from Topsail, and left with the Domine, with a full knowledge of its contents, to be delivered after the ceremony should be fairly concluded. Outside, as we have seen, it was addressed to the young bridegroom only: inside it had a double direction and read as follows, unmistakably in the hand writing of the jolly legal dignitary: 
               
                   
                      
                         
                           
                               
                                 Mr. and Mrs. Charles Denniston; 
                                 at Rev. Mr. Ryckman's: 
                               
                              Greeting:
                            
                           If you two young people have made fools of yourselves long enough, and think that you are better married than you could have been in my parlor, perhaps you will do me the favor to turn around and come home again. You had better hurry, for supper will be ready, and I do not like my food spoiled by waiting. 
                           
                              The very-badly-used but affectionate father of one or two of you, 
                              WILLIAM HOLLOWAY.
                            
                         
                      
                  
                
               "Oh, Charley! Charley!" the young wife found breath to say, after the indulgence of that relieving laughter. "What a pair of ninnies we have made of ourselves! Trying to cheat father, and he knowing all the time what we were doing! He is a dear, good old soul, but as funny as he is good, and I might have known better than to try playing tricks upon him. But never mind-I am going home to take my revenge by hugging him nearly to death, no matter how much he laughs at us both-though I am afraid that we shall never hear the last of this brilliant operation!" 
               By this time the laughter of Lettice Denniston was blended with a sadder and yet far happier feeling, to which she was not half so free in giving utterance. Her father was not angry with her-only amused and treating her like a child; and she could bear that! She was a happy wife, and yet she was not to be exiled from her father's house, his heart, her little bed-chamber, the picture of her dead mother! Oh, how much ridicule she could bear, when it brought with it so blest an assurance! 
               As was very natural, the affair did not strike the bridegroom in quite the same light, though he fully appreciated the old man's keenness and no longer wondered at the ease with which he had been allowed to steal away with his bride. He could laugh a little, but not freely, as yet, for mortification predominated over merriment. A bona fide elopement had a spark of the romantic about it; but what romance was there in this secret gallop for nothing?-and who likes to have a pet project, however trifling, turned away from its original purpose and made of no use or inimical? Then followed wonder as to the knowledge which the Squire had so evidently obtained hours before-who could have discovered his project and betrayed it? These considerations were very puzzling; and it was with quite an effort that the young bridegroom remembered how all this might at last prove for the best-that an elopement which had secured him a charming wife and must satisfy his father, could not be set down as a failure-that laughter, though it might tingle, would not kill-and that his dear little runaway (ah, there was the consideration which after all calmed and reconciled him!)-that his dear little runaway would not be even for a moment exiled from her father's heart, or obliged to shed one bitter tear in waiting for his forgiveness. 
               From the moment when he reached this point of consideration, Charley Denniston was himself again, laughing as gaily as the rest at what had before seemed so unfortunate and embarrassing. And it was without an effort at merriment that at last he sprang up, caught his wife of half-an-hour by the hand, and said: 
               "Come, Lettice, little wife!-what a big word that is in my mouth, isn't it, Domine?-come let those laugh who win!-put on your cloak, and let us go home to supper! Unless that rascally old Squire can chuckle you away from me-and I don't think he can!-who cares whether he is tormenting us or somebody else?" 
               A sensible conclusion, which proved that Charley Denniston was almost worthy of the bright little woman he had won. And a conclusion followed by the hasty drawing up of the carriage at the gate; and kisses and farewells between the minister's wife and Lettice; and warm shakings of the hand between the young husband and the Domine; and a multiplicity of those good wishes which are never more touching than when paid by the young to the old, and the old to the young; and the slipping into the withered old hand, of a bit of folded paper worth fifty dollars at a certain bank-counter in New York; and careful wrappings-up and pinnings-up of the young bride against the gale and the rain; and the dashing away of the rested horses, through the rain and the mud, towards Topsail, full in the teeth of the unabated storm. 
               There are no revelations to make, of that ride of five miles back from the parsonage to the village, or of the conversation, if any there was, which took place within the gloom of that old carriage. It was the first hour after marriage-the bridal chamber itself was not more sacred. If with hearts joined but hands severed, the two had sat close when they passed that road in the other direction, who will believe that they avoided each other now? If there were low words, and broken assurances of affection, and little ripplings of mutual laughter, and even kisses caught between the jolts with as much difficulty as butterflies in a summer meadow,-what then except the reflection that the laughter had fallen into sad silence long ago, and that the butterfly kisses have died upon the lips that gave them wing? 
               Once, during that ride-they were at the time just passing the mill pond-the horses shied at some uncouth dark object dimly discernible in the edge of the water, which did not seem to the driver to have been there when they drove up, earlier in the evening. And again-when they were not more than half a mile from the village, the carriage was hailed by a voice which semed to come from the middle of the muddy road: "Hallo, there!-hallo!-stop and give us a lift!" followed by less amiable words when the request was disregarded. But these were mere incidental circumstances, without any connection, so far as they could know, with the general fortunes of that eventful evening. 
               Not much more than half an hour from the parsonage-spite of mud and jolts-when the smoking horses drew up with the returned runaways at the door of Squire Holloway's residence. The time was between nine and ten o'clock; and they noticed, as they passed, that the store was closed and dark, and as they approached the house, that all the lower windows were ablaze, with voices sounding within as if a large number of people were assembled. It is only truth to say that at this discovery the hearts of both the truants sank, and that they-insensibly copying the Major-"shivered in their boots." Here was even a severer ordeal than they had expected. That maliciously merry old Squire, it was now evident, had invited his principal neighbors in the village, to aid him in receiving the married runaways and to assist him in laughing at their ridiculous position! The terrible knowledge came to both at the same moment; and it must be confessed that at that same moment a tear of mortification flowed to the eye of Lettice Denniston, at the thought that the father whom she loved so well would make her the laughingstock of the whole village,-while Charley, under a correspondingly sudden impulse, if he had but known another spot within miles of travel, where he could bestow his wife and himself for the night, would have been very likely to adopt that course and leave the merry-makers without ever a victim. 
               But when affairs seem at the worst, they are very often on the point of mending; and the reception of Lettice Denniston and her husband was not to be half so painful an affair as each had imagined. If Squire Holloway loved his joke, how much more deeply and absorbingly did he love his merry, mad-cap daughter! Make her a laughing stock for the gossips of the village?-heaven forgive the thought that had momentarily done him so much injustice! Whether the old man had maintained a spy at the door, or whether he had himself kept watch to know of the arrival before all others-certain it is that as Charley Denniston handed out his travelling-companion he found her clasped in her father's arms, felt his own hand grasped by the still energetic fingers of the model jurist, was dragged with her through the kitchen door and into a small room adjoining it, then unoccupied, and there made a partner with Letty in a running address of reception which amazingly relieved both the new-comers. 
               "So here you are, are you, young scapegraces! Run away from me, will you, baggage! And you-Mr. Charley Denniston, play your stale city tricks about 'losing fortunes,' and all that sort of thing, upon a plain country Squire! Couldn't trust us, eh? Thought we wanted your money, and had to try us! Shame on your suspicious, sir!-if it was not for this little girl, that I love better than all the world else, I should never forgive you-never! I suppose you are married, of course?" 
               "Yes, father!" penitently answered Letty, through whose brain, meanwhile, were running some strange thoughts suggested by her father's words. 
               "Yes, Squire Holloway-I suppose that I may call you 'father'-I am proud and happy to say that we are married, in spite of your prohibition!" much less penitently answered his new son-in-law. 
               "You be hanged, with your big words!" sententiously replied the Squire. "To serve you rightly, I would take you both into the parlor, tell the whole story to the neighbors whom I have invited here to-night to see me-to see me, not you, you monkeys!-and have you laughed at until you did not know where to hide your heads. But I am going to do better by you, on condition that you never again attempt to play me a trick, either of you, while you live! Not one of the neighbors in the house knows that you have run away. They all know me as an oddity, and I have invited them all here with the understanding that you had gone off to be married, in that ridiculous manner, with my full knowledge and consent. Now keep your own counsel, and you will be safe, at least for to-night!" 
               "Oh, father! you do not know how much I thank you, and how good a girl I will try to be, all the rest of my life, for this consideration when I did not deserve it at all!" half sobbed and half laughed the young wife, bestowing another embrace in token of her sincerity. 
               "And I have only to say, Squire Holloway-'father,' I know that I may use that word, now!-that you are the truest gentleman as well as one of the best fathers I have ever met; for you know how to punish with out degrading!" was the endorsement of Charley Denniston. 
               "Do you say so, young man?" replied the Squire, grasping his hand again and shaking it warmly. "Then by Jupiter I have not been mistaken in you, and you have the ring of the true metal! You might have made a mistake to regret all your life, in this night's work, if I had been some one else than I am; for stealing an old man's only daughter is no light offence, as you may know some day when you have children of your own. But that is all past, now: throw off those wet wrappers, smooth your faces, hold your tongues, and let us see how you look among 'company,' as old married people!" 
               A coquettish smoothing sweep of the hand over the curls of Lettice Denniston, with a glance in the fragment of glass that hung in the little bye-room; and almost before that was completed the father had ushered them along the hall and thrown them into the midst of his neighbors who filled the parlor and his own room, with the door open between. Not less than thirty or forty persons-married men and their wives, young men and their sweethearts-almost all plainly and some humbly dressed-were there assembled; and among them the Squire shoved his two returned truants with the cheery words: 
               "Here they are, good people!-my two babies who could not get married without going half a dozen miles through the rain to have one particular minister perform the dreadful operation!" 
               Then what flockings round the bridal pair; and what glances of admiration bestowed upon both (at least by those of the opposite sex): and what good-natured hits and sly allusions to the fearful situation in which they had placed themselves; and what enquiries of Charley Denniston, whether he was going to take the flower of their village away with him to the great city at once; and what private sneerings in the corner by a couple of vinegarish old maids, who declared that "they don't see anything about that young whipper-snapper, to make him such a catch;" and what glances of pride, sidelong from the bridegroom's eye, as he saw how all the villagers seemed to love his young wife and how easily and sweetly she moved among them all; and what pangs of momentary jealousy when the privilege of "kissing the bride" was somewhat roughly taken by the ruder young members of the male sex; and what sudden sunrise flushings of pretty Lettice's peachy cheek, when some of the badinage grew broader than she was in the habit of hearing; and what a merry, uproarious time altogether, with the jubilant Squire beaming and laughing over it all like a benevolent old sun that had a mission to make every one warm and genial and happy! 
               They had been afraid to come home-silly young runaways!-dreaded the moment of meeting with the deceived father, and the scenes to follow. And this was what they had found. Surely there are some people and some events in the world, so much better to us than we have either deserved or anticipated, that we ought to be able to bear a few disappointments without too much of hopeless repining! 
               Just then there was an interruption, of not half so unpleasant a character as that which summoned Don Juan from his ghostly feast with the Commandatore. And yet it came very mysteriously like rumor, and checked the merriment in mid career before any one could discover its precise origin. It was, in fact, the call to that supper in behalf of which the Squire had implored an early return-that supper, many of the materials for which had been so slily in preparation, during the previous two days, under the hands of his confederate "help." And what a supper it proved to be, when the whole company were marshalled through the hall and into the dining room-when some of the matrons had followed immemorial custom by placing the new-married couple side by side in the middle of the table, the biggest fruitcake before them, and the merry host exercising his functions of carver and distributor opposite, sending off a jest with every chicken-wing and a pleasantry with every plate of neat's tongue garnished with apple jelly-and when Rod, some time since returned from his Phtonian adventure, dried, arrayed in his "Sunday best," and as forcibly solemn of face as if dumping a Major into a mill-pond had been a sheer impossibility, frisked about like an animated jumping-jack, assisting the volunteer neighbor-girls in their handing around the dishes loaded with homely delicacies. 
               This is not, as James Triplet pathetically remarked to Lysimachus of his unborn comedy, a "cookery-book;" and as once before, beneath the roof of the same dwelling, the gourmand has been indicated if not shamelessly exposed, we shall be spared, here, the bill-of-fare of Lettice's unexpected wedding-supper. Enough to say that it was such an unpretending yet delicious "feast of fat things" as in many a country home, at every holiday recurrence, year after year, shames the perfectly appointed table d' hote of the fashionable hotel or the diner a la carte of the luxurious restaurant. 
               But that hymenial banquet, which had so suddenly interrupted the merriment in the parlor, was itself doomed to be interrupted in turn. The sins of that atrocious old wretch, Squire Holloway, were destined to "find-him out" a little sooner than the pos- sibility had been set down in his mental programme. Just when the feast was at its height there came a thundering rap on the big iron knocker at the bulls-eyed door, ringing through the house like a knell of doom and making every one pause with the piece of chicken uplifted on the fork or the cup of old Java half raised to the lips. No common rap, that!-not the timid "rat-tat" of a casual wayfarer inquiring his way through the storm; nor yet the light, merry, rapid manipulation of a frequent visitor sure of his welcome. There was a ponderosity about that knock which intimated that the visitor had a right to come in, on urgent business, and would take no denial; and yet it had the quick, sharp, nervous repetition of a band with the pulses agitated-even stormy. It sounded like pursuit and punishment, as the knocking at the gate of Inverness Castle may have rung to Macbeth in the gray of that early morning after the murder of Duncan; and if "False Sextus, who wrought the deed of shame," had a knocker to his palace door on the Pincian Hill, and if any one of the relatives of Lucrece paid him a visit shortly after his costly experiment with that model Roman matron (on both which points, unfortunately, history leaves us in doubt), some such warning, blustering, threatening "rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-ta-ta-a-a-t" was unquestionably the signal of his coming. 
               The strong-armed "help," the Squire's confederate, answered the door in that instance; and the moment after performing that office she came up to the back of the host's chair and informed him, in what has sometimes been designated as a "horse-whisper," with strong indications of a laugh as the undertone that "somebody was at the door and wanted to see him-right away!" Thereupon being bidden to insist on the person's coming at once into the supper-room she went back to the door and delivered her message, shortly after which event there was heard the sound of heavy feet approaching through the hall, blended with a kind of whistling, quashy squeak, such as firemen sometimes make when the pipe has been playing by mistake into their boots, or oystermen when there is a sudden leak in their India-rubbers. There could be no doubt that the approaching personage, whoever he might be, was leaving a trail behind him in which very young ducks could paddle to advantage. Then the door opened, and the man who had knocked was made visible. 
               It was the Avenger-not of Blood, perhaps, but certainly of Water Major Jeff Taddlewick, just arrived at Topsail on his long trudge from the mill-pond, and presenting an appearance which made any drinking of those suspended cups of coffee and any eating of those postponed portions of chicken, impossible except with serious danger of strangulation. His face was very wet; and a scratch, beginning at the centre of the Roman nose and extending nearly to the ear, did not render him handsomer or more amiable-looking. His hat had been lost in the marine adventure, no doubt to furnish a nest for happy young turtles at the bottom of the pond; and in its place over his plastered gray hair was wound a gaudy red-silk handkerchief which forcibly suggested piracy as seen on the stage. To say that his clothes were soaked, by pond-water and rain, would not be sufficient-they were sopped: he might have been wrung with excellent results in a time of drought. Then the thigh-boots, instruments of that suggestive quashy noise, must have contained half a gallon each, making locomotion anything but light and pleasant, and leaving it doubtful whether he had really been travelling by land, or water. A most pitiable spectacle; and yet such is the callousness of human nature that most of the people at table, when they had sufficiently recovered from their surprise to recognize the victim and his plight,-laughed-actually laughed! 
               "Ah, Major!" "Why, Major!" "Good gracious, Major!"-such were the exclamations that ran round the table, while the Squire commanded his risibles sufficiently to say: 
               "Why, what on earth has happened, Major? You look wet!" 
               "Look wet? d--n it, I think I am wet!" began the victim in reply; and he was doubt on the point of stating what had occurred and demanding some explanation of it, when his eyes wandered across the table and fixed upon certain objects there which froze the words upon his lips and left him absolutely dumb. There, at the table, at home and happy, he saw Lettice Holloway and the man who had been accused of running away with her; and there, behind them and just handing over a dish of preserves for their delectation, was Rod, the young man whom he had pleasantly supposed dashed to pieces by those unmanageable steeds! 
               There are certain single moments in life, during which we learn more than can ordinarily be received in a twelvemonth; and just then the Major experienced one of them. He was no fool, in the ordinary acceptation of the term; and as he stood in the yet unclosed door and saw those unexpected Banquos of his late adventure, there came rushing through his brain a whole avalanche of suspicions which grew at once into mountains of damning certainty. Squire Holloway, as he knew, was an unscrupulous joker; he had been played upon-he, Major Jeff Taddlewick! There had been no elopement; he had been sent on a wild goose chase (or was it a wild duck?) provided with a bogus warrant and purposely dumped into a mill-pond, to drown or crawl out in that wretched condition. In an instant rage flamed in his face, and his dignity demanded full and instant reparation. 
               "Look here, Squire Holloway!" he thundered out-"-- me if I don't believe that you know all about this-that you have been playing me a cursed trick; and if you have, I'll pay you for it, if I work twenty years to do it!" 
               "Play a trick upon a man so smart as you, Major? oh no, that would be impossible!" blandly answered the Squire. "You brought me some intelligence, you know, Major, and I set you to acting on it. That is all, Major. Won't you sit by and have some supper?" 
               "-Your supper!" raved the victim. "The next time. Squire Holloway, that I try to do you a kindness-" 
               "It will be after you are dead? yes, I know that!" was the reply. "Well, I have punished you pretty well, and I am almost sorry for it, but not quite, you infernal lying, spying sneak, that tried to pass yourself off for a friend to me, when you have done nothing else than back-bite me to every neighbor I had, any time the last ten years! Try it again, won't you, Major?" 
               "I'll try you, you cussed old scoundrel! I'll pay you for this, if it costs me my life!" foamed the Major, again. 
               "No you won't!" replied the Squire. "You are too big a coward to do what might bring your carcase into trouble! You can't stand anything, Major-not even a ride that was a little damp! Offered to go through 'fire and water' to serve me, didn't you? Well, I have put you through the water, and if you keep on in your usual track you'll get to the fire by-and-bye! Won't you come in and dry yourself and have a little supper, Major?" 
               No end would be gained by putting upon record the frightful oath with which Squire Holloway's "friend" concluded the conversation before he slammed the door and stalked out and away homeward, a wetter but by no means a wiser man. Enough of him, as Topsail and its vicinity had, then and for many a year after. Nor is it a matter of any consequence how much of the adventure the arch-mischief explained to his wondering and laughing guests. Not enough, we may be sure, to betray the runaways; and yet enough to make the severity of the jest apparent, and Rod a hero. There was no further interruption to that memorable supper, which ended at last, as long ago have ended and become mere matter of memory the days in which its company laughed and feasted. 
               Lettice Holloway was Lettice Denniston-a wondering, anxious, happy bride. The store must lose its mistress, and be as lonely, thenceforward, as the empty cage from which a song-bird has chirped its last note and flown away. The old man who loved her so was to be more lonely-how lonely none but he could tell; yet happy in her happiness and in the knowledge that she was nobly mated. The little snowy-curtained chamber was hers still-her bride-chamber now! And what Charley Denniston told her, there, while the white arms were round his neck, late that night, when the storm-wind about the eaves and the storm-drops on the pane were blending in a strangely-happy epithalamium,-what he told her of the trial to which a father's anxiety for his welfare had subjected her, but of the trust and love in his own heart which had asked no such trial-and what she replied to him, of a hope that his father's heart and arms would open to the poor, wayward little country-girl, without shame or disappointment-and what he said to her again, of assurance that none could despise his choice but all must envy him the little treasure of beauty and goodness, and merry, fond, unspoiled womanhood, that he had been so fortunate as to win,-were not all these a part of wedded love's first confidence, no more to be shaped into mimic words than the first cry of joy of a mother over her babe or the sad wail with which she gives it up to heaven? 
               And were not those confidences true as they were fond? Howland Denniston could best have answered that question, on the night when his handsome house on Broadway, opposite the Bowling-Green of his own proud city was all ablaze, welcoming home one whom he had already taken to his heart, and of whom he said in after days: "My daughter Lettice-Charles' wife,-is the merriest, dearest, noblest little woman-the best wife and mother-that I have ever met in all my long life!" 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXVI. 
               THE STRONG FISHERMAN AT OAK ISLAND. 
               THERE has been something of the sunshine of youth and love and merriment, shining on many of the late pages, in the fortunes of the Squire's daughter and those who immediately surrounded her. Alas, that wrong and sorrow follow hope and joy-that in a return to the more personal interest of the Wrecker of Topsail the dark shadow closes down and scarcely lifts again till the very end! 
               Barnard North, far back in this relation, has been seen taking his place among the fishermen of Oak Island, at the mouth of Cape Fear River, North Carolina. Something of his past history, or at least of that portion of it which embodied his wrongs and sorrows, was hinted to the fishermen by Captain Duff before he went away; but few enquiries were the result, and the twenty or thirty men who at that season of the year made their home at the Island only knew him as a brave and hardy man, the superior of all of them in shore-craft, and one who had met with misfortunes, not of his own preparing, driving him away from his northern home-perhaps for a time and perhaps forever. 
               The Wrecker, so placed, set himself quietly to his labor and was outwardly happy and cheerful. Even mentally he was no doubt so to a great extent, for though an exite he had exchanged the stifling walls of a prison for the free air and the flashing sea, and that reflection was almost enough for happiness. Yet there must have been a terrible anxiety gnawing at his heart, to know the fate of those he had left behind him, and such an ever-present impatience is quite enough for misery. To write to his wife or his children might possibly be, through his letter falling into wrong hands, to betray the place of his concealment and make himself liable to reclamation by the authorities of his State as a convicted felon. He had been advised (how, is no matter) not to write, and not to expect any letters from the North, as the same danger might arise from any letter betraying his whereabouts by its direction to him. There was no option but to wait, with what patience he could command, until the return of the "Susan" or some other of the coasting-vessels carrying naval-stores from the port should bring him intelligence from Topsail and Clayboro. 
               Weeks went by in this quiet labor and yet with this burning anxiety for intelligence from home. Of the few vessels that dropped in past the Island, none bore any mark which recalled them to his recollection. It was nearly the first of June, and the hot sun of the Carolinas had begun to tell in some degree on the health and spirits of a man owning the nativity of the cool coasts of New England, when into the little harbor came the first sail which seemed to bear along with it the airs of home. 
               Barnard North had just landed from the morning catch on the Island, and was drawing his skiff up the sandy beach, with the aid of two of the fishermen who had accompanied him-when his eye turned seaward to observe a sail coming up from the bar. Some time since the Wrecker had seen that vessel; but the eyes of the shoremen are proverbially as slow to lose the contour of a boat as they are the countenance of a friend; and he had too often seen that vessel lying moored in Bush Inlet or passing him down the beach when he lay off on the fishing grounds, to be mistaken for a moment in her identity. It was the "Jane"-the same vessel on board of which Uncle Zeke Robbins and his companions Decker and Radstock had played the trick upon Hawkins and the constables, a few months before-an operation yet so well remembered (as indeed it is probably remembered to-day) over all the County of Seaboard. 
               Without a word to his companions the Wrecker ceased pulling up the boat, motioned them to desist, threw back the oars into her bottom, set his heavy shoulder to the stern and ran her back off the beach as if she had been an Indian birch or a wicker-basket. 
               "Ki!" said one of the negroes, watching him from a little distance, "dis nigga couldn't do dat! Monsus strong man-Dat Massa North! Mus ha' had plenty ob hoecake and possum when he little, less he nebber handle um boat 's he was tree men! Ki! dere 'pears to be somefin suddenly the matter of um!" 
               So there was, but the darkey had no explanatory answer, either from the Wrecker or his own companions. With a single shove in addition the heavy boat was in the water; and then Barnard North, throwing himself into her and seizing the oars with hands more determinedly nervous than they had ever been since that fatal day when he launched to save the perishing men of the "America," dashed them into the water and swung her round as if on a pivot. In a moment more he was flying away across the reach, towards the schooner. 
               The "Jane" was coming up with a light breeze, and the single rower had no difficulty in cutting her off. As he neared the schooner he seemed to be recognized, for she luffed, lost way and lay with her sails shivering. Griffin, whose memorable Greek cap had been changed into a narrow-brimmed tarpaulin since he left Hatteras, was in the waist and knew at a glance the tall iron-gray figure in the boat. He threw a rope as it swept alongside the schooner, and almost as she touched, the foot of the Wrecker was on the deck. 
               "I am so glad to see you-heart-glad, Barney North!" said Griffin, grasping him by the hand with a grip only less forcible than his own. The Wrecker could not speak for a moment; then he choked out, huskily: 
               "Griffin-my wife and children?" 
               "Your wife? Heavens, man!-haven't you heard?" began the astonished Captain. Then he remembered himself and added: "No, how could you? There hasn't been anything down from the Inlet, I believe, since Duff came back." 
               "Griffin-I say, John Griffin, what do you mean?" he asked, still more huskily, and grasping at once the main shrouds near which he was standing, as a deadly fear came over him and weakened even his powerful frame. 
               "Your children are well," replied Griffin, unable at the first moment to master words that would convey the sad story. "I saw Barnard and Willie both, not more than a week ago; and Charlotte-" 
                
               "My wife, man?-my wife?" cried the Wrecker, starting towards the Captain as if he would seize and wring the reluctant words from him. 
               "Be a man, Barney North, and don't take it too hard!" again began the sympathizing seaman. 
               "Man," cried the Wrecker, his husky voice changed almost to the hoarse roar of the sea which had so long been his companion and playmate-"Man!-what do you mean? I ask you again, where is Rachael North?" An indefinable impression had at that moment struck the husband, that she might have been arrested, confined, and even punished, for some presumed share in his escape. That thought was madness: what was the thought to be, so soon to displace it! 
               "Rachael North is under six feet of sod, in Poplar graveyard!" said Griffin in a low voice, the tears starting to eyes not often used to weep, spite of all his hardihood,-at thought of the deadly pain which he must be inflicting. 
               "Dead! Rachael North dead! Oh, my God!" cried the bereaved husband, falling back against the shrouds as if some physical blow had staggered him from his perpendicular. 
               "Dead-yes, dead," were the three sad, conclusive words of the sea captain, in reply. 
               There was total silence for a moment, only broken by the light flapping of the shaken sails. Then the Wrecker partially raised his head, which had been dropped upon his breast, and asked in a voice husky as ever but lower and fearfully intense: 
               "How and when did she die? Tell me all!" 
               "She died by the hand of one of the keepers of your prison, the night you got away. You must have heard 'em shoot." 
               "Great heaven!" moaned the Wrecker-"they killed her, as they would have done a dog, out of spite against me!" 
               "No," answered Griffin, "they shot at you, as you was gettin' over the wall-so I heard some of 'em say,-and hit her. They didn't mean to do any harm to her, I am sure they didn't; but I don't know as that mends the matter, seein' that you have lost her." 
               "My wife!-my poor murdered wife! To save my worthless life, you were to die like some miserable beast shot down for thieving!" groaned the wretched man, his head sinking low on his breast and apparently all his strength deserting him. Little by little his giant bulk seemed to sink down into a heap, instead of sitting, on the bulwark of the schooner. Then his elbows sank to his knees and his head fell between his hands-that most painful attitude of abject despair and hopelessness,-as they had done in the little cabin at Topsail immediately after his great bereavement, and as they had done still oftener and longer during his imprisonment, before the wife who could never again creep to his side, come into his dungeon with some faint memory of bygone happiness. He spoke no more, for the time-words from the cold occupants of a vault would have been no more impossible. The schooner had payed off again and gathered way to prevent her touching on a troublesome sand-bar; and towing the boat at her side she was slowly moving up the harbor. 
               "Barney North!" said Griffin, approaching the silent figure after a few moments of this awful change, and dropping his hand kindly on the crouching shoulder. "Barney North-it is hard, I know it; for one trip when I went back I found my wife wearing black and my curly-headed boy that was so lively when I came away, gone to sleep in the church-yard; and flesh-and-blood is flesh-and-blood, old mate, whether it is wife or child! But we must bear these things, you know, when we can't help 'em! Be a man, as you've always been, foul or fair weather; and cheer up!" 
               "Be a man? I John Griffin, you don't know what you are asking!" replied the sufferer, in a voice as husky as it had been when he made the first enquiry. Then there was again silence for an instant, only broken by the creaking of a block or the ripple of the calm water as the schooner moved gently through it. Then suddenly the Wrecker sprang from his position, and raised his tall form erect as one of the fallen archangels might have stood at the instant when blasted by the angry eye of the Eternal,-his eyes blazing with a fury which showed that all his fierce and sullen madness had returned, a thousand times worse than in the first days of his persecution. He raised his clenched right hand in the air, as if he would have struck dead some other enemy who stood before him, and hissed out in tones of deadly rage and hatred through his clenched teeth: 
               "D-- them all! They dragged me from my home, as a thief, and they made me a murderer! They made me a dog and an outcast! They killed her, and they would have killed me! Give them to me here-judges, juries, witnesses, the whole cursed pack of the people who do what they call justice,-and I would glut hell with them before its time! The curse of the dead and the living fall upon them all, till they rot and die and go to the company of the devils where they belong!" 
               A fearful imprecation-in many respects an unjust one; and remarkable as coming from lips that had seldom opened with so dreadful a purpose. But the most horrible blasphemer of the present century was an earnest and devoted minister of the gospel whose reason had become suddenly dethroned. When the "milk of human kindness" curdles with wrong or sours with madness, the very goodness of the past seems to be warranty for the rage and evil of the future. And there is little doubt that the final blow to his governing reason, before shattered and tottering, had been given in the intelligence of the death of Rachael North, and that the Wrecker of Topsail was thenceforth to all intents and purposes a maniac. 
               Without another word, after the hurling out of that withering curse-without one word of thanks to those who had always been his friends in trouble as well as prosperity,-he sprang to the side of the schooner, dropped over into the boat, even before Griftin could check the way of the schooner-cast off his rope and fell astern. He did not even answer the heart-broken "Good-bye, Barney!" that the sympathizing sailor sent after him as they separated. The Captain saw him put his hands to his head and stand in that position for a moment, as if lost and uncertain what to do-then saw him drop into his seat with a force which sent the boat reeling, take the oars mechanically into his hands and pull away again towards Oak Island, as the "Jane" moved on up the river towards the town. 
               Months went by before he was again heard from, by any of those who had been his friends at the North-by any except the fishermen with whom he had been temporarily associated. And even they, it would seem (for there is a mystery over many of the events of all the period remaining to be covered by this narration)-even they knew but little of him thereafter. They only knew that his demeanor had changed from comparative cheerfulness to a fierce sullenness that more than once threatened life, between the time when he rowed off to the schooner from Oak Island and, the little time after when he rowed back again. The change was noticeable when he returned and while he lingered among them-a hopeless, sullen, taciturn man, often sitting for hours with his head dropped between his knees, and often absent for days without any one knowing whither he had disappeared,-as they told to curious enquirers from the Northern coast when after events had made the unfortunate man still more a wonder and a pity. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXVII. 
               CHARLOTTE NORTH'S BRIDAL. 
               THREE months since the revelation to Barnard North of his crowning loss, and a year since that fatal day when the good ship "America" had gone to pieces on Topsail bar, with young Robert's death its crowning calamity. A year with its universal change, and of how much change to many who have prominently figured in this relation. Rachael North in her martyr-grave; Gil Davis in that of the justly-punished thief and slanderer. Lettice Holloway Denniston, away in her city home, freshening the formal society around her, with her native gaiety caught in another and a very different atmosphere, and yet preparing for sweeter and more solemn duties than any that she had before undertaken. Poor Joe Harrison, his last mad hope swept away in the marriage of the Squire's daughter, drunkenness culminating in mania a potu. Thunder and Lightning sold out of his hands by those of the Sheriff, and the grave of public charity soon to be filled by one born to a better lot. The Wrecker an exile, and in his remaining family change as sad and startling as any yet recorded. 
               It was a quiet September night, with the chirp of the autumn crickets in the stunted shrubbery which lined the road leading from Bush Inlet towards Topsail beach, and the low mean of the sea coming softened to the ear against the land-breeze which seldom failed to blow on the coast after sunset. Barnard North was walking that road-not with the elastic step of former days, but with that dragging swing of the heavy feet which seemed to convey motion by word, in the Saxon phrase "trudging." He had come home again, precisely whence no one at the North could tell-had come home, spite of the outlawed position in which he believed himself to stand. Only an hour previously he had landed, in a boat from a strange coasting-vessel, at the mouth of the Inlet, and almost on the very spot from which he had taken his departure through the ice of the preceding February. 
               The change happening to others has already been noted; but which of them had suffered more at the hands of the spoiler, than he? A terribly altered man within the year, even in outward appearance: the change within only the All-seeing could measure. There had been only a few silver hairs on his brow, on the morning when young Robert launched with him to death: now the whole mass of heavy hair was long and grizzled, and streaked in places with those clear and decided reeves of dusky silver which age has no power to bring, but which come so often under the strokes of chronic disease or the pangs of intense mental suffering. His head had acquired something of a habit of drooping, and his very tall form showed the effect in a slight curve of the shoulders, such as those shoulders might have shown if the body instead of the mind had been the bearer of the sad overload. His brows were heavy and gray, and his forehead and mouth were wrinkled into frowns of peevish sullenness which had never been resident there during his earlier and happier days. Those who looked upon him closely could see that dull glare of the eye, with intermittent flashes of unnatural light, which bespeaks partial insanity; and when he spoke, his words came habitually short and curt, as if he grudged them to the very air. His hands quivered and at times gripped as he half-stumbled half-strode along; and sometimes he muttered sentences too low and too thick in their utterance for shaping by any mortal ear. The Wrecker of Topsail was still a giant, but a terrible and fearful giant now-a giant subjected to the same fate as those unfortunate vessels upon which he had so often looked in their extremity-utterly wrecked!
                
               Yet changed as Barnard North evidently was, and completely as his habitual feelings had been soured and broken up by the pressure of shame and wrong,-it was plain that one emotion of the past still lingered-he held loving memories of his children. He had come back to see them, from the madness and perhaps the crime of his exile-come back, though he believed that in doing so he braved his old and hated prison. He was really running no such risk, for, unknown to the shoremen at the time when the last intelligence which had ever reached him left the coast,-a pardon had been secured from the Governor, through the intervention of Presiding Judge Nichols, Sheriff Parker and others who joined with them in the petition; and the Wrecker was really free, without danger of arrest, to set foot once more on the soil of the State he had deserted. But it was through danger that he believed himself to be boldly walking in that return; and the belief marked the true depth of his parental feeling. He had been seen, a little earlier that evening, to come ashore at the mouth of the Inlet: he had been recognized and spoken with by one of the fishermen living there; and he had asked after his children and received the information with reference to them. Barnard and William, as the man told him, he believed were away for a day or two, fishing with some of his old companions farther down the beach; but the old home was not entirely deserted. Charlotte was there-oh, yes, his little Charlotte was there; and if the vindictive hand of the law would only allow him one hour beneath his own roof and then drag him away, he would go home to see the last link remaining to the love and the sex of his murdered wife. 
               Heavily the Wrecker trudged along the road in the deepening dusk; and it was full dark, though starlight, when he came out upon the causeway, a quarter of a mile inboard from his cottage. There was a light shining dimly through the window that looked up the causeway, and it showed him the location of his old home before he could otherwise have discovered it. Nearly a year had gone by since his last leaving that cabin-a captive and a dishonored man. Within that year he had been twice arraigned, had shed human blood, had become an exile, had lost the one most precious to him on earth: with what sensations must he have gazed upon that glimmering candle shining from the window of what had been the "best room" of the little dwelling!-with what overwhelming emotions must he again have approached that cradle and grave of all that had once been dearest! 
               Which of us is there, who does not pause before breaking the seal of some letter the contents of which we would almost give life to know without the delay of one instant? Which of us is there, who would not, after a long absence, see first for one moment unobserved those whom we loved and from whom we had been separated? The rough and broken old Wrecker probably did not philosophize over this feeling, but certain it is that he pursued that course at once so unexplainable and so natural. He neared the house, and the light was still burning. A curtain of common blue and white check was drawn across the lower part of the window; but the light shone clear through the upper panes, which were unshrouded, and so tall a man as Barnard North could easily overlook the string which held the shirred curtain. He trode lightly as he approached the window, paused for one instant with an indefinable feeling, then looked in upon the scene of his lost happiness. 
               There are some scenes which really have the fabled power of the shield of Perseus, about which we continually make quotations as a fable. They make us stone, or that harder substance, iron-if we have before been composed of any more plastic material. The life of usefulness and benevolence ceases from that fatal moment; and we are thenceforth dead or only alive to evil passions and accursed revenges. Almost stone, in misery, wrong and incipient madness the Wrecker had already become; but he stood face to face with the Gorgon's head at last. 
               He had heard no voices as he approached, but as he looked over the curtain two were audible-two, both of which he recognised, as he did the persons of those who spoke. Disdaining the poor remains of a settee which stood on one side of the room, and lying at ease on three chairs, his coat off and his whole appearance that of a man who made himself perfectly at home and comfortable-was Thomas Hillyer, the supercargo whose rescue, one year before, had cost the gazer so dearly and inaugurated all his misfortunes. His arm was thrown over the back of one of the chairs, and a slippered foot was dangling over another. All his attitude and expression seemed those of a man who had neither a care, a trouble, a duty or a responsibility, in the whole round of existence. 
               Beside him, or rather before him, was a very different object. Charlotte North knelt there, with clasped hands and thin, pale face, her long fair hair thrown wildly around her shoulders and her red eyes showing that she had wept long and painfully. A little taller than she had been a year before, when her father had last seen her; the same weak, fragile-looking thing, little more than a child, and yet with something in her whole manner showing that she had advanced rapidly towards sorrowful womanhood. Her dress, of common cotton calico, seemed worn and faded, as all the room showed abject poverty. Her words, as the Wrecker heard them, were at times low and plaintive, then almost rising to a scream of agony; but his ear lost nothing after he first heard and saw! 
               "Oh, don't say that you are going away!" the poor girl was sobbing. "Don't leave me all alone! Oh, what will I ever do?-what will I ever do?" 
               "There-don't go on so, Charlotte, you little fool!" was the reply of Hillyer, shifting his leg into a more comfortable position, and evidently about as much impressed by that heart-broken appeal as the stony face of a mountain ledge might be by a cricket chirping in one of its crevices. "Don't whine and howl in that manner-it will do no good, with me! You will get along well enough: I shall leave you some money before I go, you know, and-" 
               "Money? oh, don't say, Thomas, that you think money is all I need?" implored the kneeling girl. "What shall I do when you are gone? A little while longer, and they won't speak to me up at the village-I am almost afraid to go there now!-and Barney and Willie will call me a shame and a disgrace to the family. Maybe they will kill me, and oh, I hope they will, if you go away!" 
               Not even when the intelligence of his wife's death had struck him like a thunder blow on the deck of the schooner off Oak Island, had the Wrecker so reeled as with the horrible knowledge which came to him at that moment. He staggered back from the window, covered his face with both hands and almost groaned aloud; then he recovered himself by a mighty effort, and set both eye and ear so close to the panes that there was serious danger of his being seen from within if either should chance to look towards the window. 
               "I tell you that you will get along well enough, if you don't make a little fool of yourself!" repeated the supercargo. "They don't much mind what you are making such a fuss about, down here, and you know it just as well as I do. And as to disgracing the family-humph! the daughter of a man who would have been in State Prison for murder, if he had not run away-" 
               "Oh, Thomas! Thomas!" broke in the poor girl, happily in time to prevent the completion of that most atrocious sentence, and perhaps not even hearing it-"won't you do what you promised, before you go away? Won't you marry me? Only leave me a good name, and let me earn my bread working in somebody's kitchen; and I won't say a word against it!" And the poor thing crept close to the heartless lounger and attempted to lay her head upon his breast. 
               "There-that'll do, I tell you, you foolish child!" said the supercargo, pettishly pushing her away. He could not have uttered a volume better describing her than that simple word "child." She was, in spite of her approach towards womanhood, a poor, weak, helpless child. The word went home to the bursting heart of the Wrecker, and rankled there almost as bitterly as the fling at the man who had 'almost been in State Prison,' coming from him!
                
               "Oh, what will I do! what will I do!" again moaned the poor girl, rising feebly and staggering across the room towards a chair in the opposite corner. Then, when she rose, the maddened father saw how total was the ruin which had been accomplished: that helpless child, totally unfit, as yet, to be left without a mother's sheltering care, was herself within a very few months of becoming a mother! 
               "Great God!-that is the man I saved at the peril of my own life, and with the sacrifice of my poor boy!" groaned the miserable father. But just then the supercargo spoke again, and again he listened. 
               "Now, Charlotte, I have had enough of nonsense, and I do not want any more of it!" pursued the seducer. "I tell you that I shall be back from Canton in a year, and then-then I may take it into my head to marry you, if you behave yourself. Now run into the other room and get me my boots, for I must go up to Topsail to-night; and if I can find time I will come and see you again before I go away. Do you hear me?" 
               A bursting sob was the only reply, as poor Charlotte staggered towards the door to obey the command of him whom she had already obeyed so fatally. That sound may have been blended with a groan of grief and rage from the Wrecker, for Hillyer fancied that he heard something, sprang up from his chairs, went hurriedly to the window and looked out. He saw nothing: there was nothing-Barnard North had staggered away from the window, just in time to prevent discovery, and in what frame of mind and with what terrible resolutions sweeping through his brain, who shall pretend to imagine! 
               Within, the wronged, ruined child had gone after the ordered boots; and Thomas Hillyer, roused by the noise he had heard or fancied, did not again lie down, but sat upon the middle one of his three chairs, preparing to substitute them for his slippers when they came. And when his victim crept softly in a moment after, and laid them gently down beside him, he did not pay her any additional attention, but took up one of the boots, stuck his foot into the top, and paused, with his fingers in both straps and, before pulling it on-evidently occupied with pleasant thoughts. He did not laugh aloud, but he certainly smiled in his content: as why should he not? What had he, about which to worry or be sad?-what did he lack, on which to felicitate himself and be happy? He had made what might be called a "good thing" out of his dangerous adventure of the "America"-enjoyed a very pleasant spring and summer in the country and on the sea-coast, costing him very little in money, and bringing him, meanwhile, such treasures in the trusting love of a child whom he could wheedle at his will, as no amount of money could well have purchased. The conversation just concluded had produced no unpleasant effect upon him: why should it have done so? Had he come down to Topsail and thrown himself into the society of the Wrecker's daughter, with the deliberate intention of working her ruin-then there might indeed have been ground for self-reproach. But he had done nothing of the kind-he had merely been tempted into vice by the evident fondness of the young girl: he had merely allowed himself to take the chances of manhood against childhood, experience against utter ignorance, strength against weakness, which so plainly offered themselves-merely allowed himself to become her destroyer! And who could expect him to repair a wrong so altogether venial? Nobody, of course, except the poor little girl to whom in some moment of forgetful-ness he might have casually mentioned the word "marriage"-and she was what he had called her-a "little fool." Taken altogether, Thomas Hillyer felt that he had good reason to be content with the past, and quite as much with the prospects of the future. He had secured a good berth again, as super-cargo in a China ship: during his absence, which could not occupy less than a year and might extend to two if some charters to Bombay should intervene-Charlotte's "little trouble" would all be over and the cause of it faded out of the public mind if the public mind had taken the trouble to think of her at all. It was a good thing to be away during that time: when that time had elapsed, he could come down to Topsail again and renew the intimacy if he chose: if he did not choose, he should probably have no more bother with her after leaving her that evening, as he should do within a few minutes. Why, we ask once more, should not Thomas Hillyer, the supercargo, who was no model scoundrel but simply a thoroughly unprincipled "good-for-nothing," heartless and worthless-have been at that moment thoroughly content with himself and the world? Free from any bond-oh, how very free he was and how very free he felt! Young and in the very bloom of health-what a long life of happiness lay before him, to enjoy that freedom and increase that content! 
               There may be character in the drawing on of boots, as well as "reason in the roasting of eggs." For the first of the pair handed by the poor little slave of Thomas Hillyer's will was drawn on with slow and nonchalant deliberation, like that of a man who was in no hurry whatever; while the second was literally jerked to its place, every muscle alert and the whole man agitated. And what could have produced so sudden and startling an effect. Nothing new was to be seen, or heard, so far as Charlotte North, who followed both eye and ear, could discover. Nothing to be seen through the dusky windows; nothing to be heard except the low moan of the waves on the sandy beach, that was never silent, night or day, for a single moment. Yet Thomas Hillyer, who had been startled before, seemed more startled now; his eye grew strangely restless and his handsome, colorless cheek pallid as the wall. He heard something, surely! Ah, it may be that sometimes, through offences quite as "venial" as that of the supercargo in working the ruin of Charlotte North, we "murder sleep" as effectually for our waking faculties, as the dagger of the ambitious Thane performed the same office for his capacities of nightly rest. All the void air may be thenceforward filled with sights and sounds, to the eye and ear made preternaturally acute-no phantom sights and sounds, but the earlier knowledge of coming and fearful realities. 
               Thomas Hillyer was certain, as he listened, that he heard something like the rumbling of wheels down the causeway. He went to the window and looked out, while the poor girl, even more startled than he, followed him but could not look above the curtain and was obliged to pull it aside at the bottom. Both saw, though the super-cargo much the more distinctly, by the starlight, an open wagon, apparently filled with men to the number of eight or ten, drawing up at the corner of the house. No voices could as yet be distinguished-their coming seemed to be intended as a surprise. And what could so many men have to do at that cottage, so late in the evening, when there was neither a wreck on shore or any preparations to be made for the business of the morning? Thomas Hillyer, oppressed with an undefinable terror, grew so much whiter that Charlotte North saw the ghastliness of his face and was almost on the point of fainting. But both were aroused, the moment after, by hearing heavy steps tramping round the house, and then by a knock at the south door-the one commonly used by the occupants. 
               "Go-see what is wanted!" ordered the supercargo, in a low voice, as the young girl hesitated trembling. She obeyed, leaving open the door between the two rooms. 
               "Who is there, and what do you want?" she asked, in her low, plaintive voice. 
                
               "We are friends, and want to come in, Charlotte," answered a rough voice, trying to tone itself to kindly speech,-outside. 
               "Tell them that you are undressed and just going to bed!" prompted the supercargo, in a loud whisper which she easily caught; and again she obeyed. 
               "Sorry for it, then," answered another voice from the outside. "You will have to dress agin' for we're a comin' in!" 
               No one can tell precisely what fear had by this time shaped itself in the mind of the supercargo; but he recognised one of the voices, as the young girl did not, and there was nothing reassuring in the recognition. 
               "Keep them out for a few minutes, Charlotte-for God's sake! Say anything to do it!" again he prompted, in the same strong whisper. 
               "Yes-yes-I will try!" the Wrecker's daughter replied in the same whisper; then, to the men without; "Please wait a few minutes, then, while I ship on my clothes." 
               "Yes, we will wait, but hurry-don't poke about it!" came back, in the same gruff voice that had first spoken. 
               There was a wooden bar across the front or north door, that leading into the "best room" and seldomest used. Thomas Hillyer, the moment this respite was gained, took down the bar as noiselessly as possible, opened the door with the same caution, caught his hat from a chair near him, and darted out, with the evident intention to escape, though from what he could not have known,-during the parley. But he was scarcely three feet beyond the door, when he felt himself seized by a pair of strong hands, and heard the unmistakable voice of one of the shoremen of Topsail: 
               "No, you don't unhook yourself in that manner, my fine fellew! We are a little too old fishermen not to stop the holes in an eel-pot!" Then raising his voice so that those behind the house could hear him: "You needn't mind that there door any more-come round here! I've got the gentleman gripped, if there's anything in the feel of his broadcloth!" 
               The supercargo, whether from alarm or surprise, had not yet spoken a word. Now, however, he found his tongue; and there may have been a tremble of fear, as there certainly was the quiver of anger, in his tone: 
               "Let go my shoulder! Who are you and what do you want!" 
               "My name is Collins-Thomas Collins. Should like to obleege you, Mr. Hillyer, but can't do it!" answered the captor, who was really the husband of that household-angel, Mary Collins. 
               "What have I done? What do you want? repeated the captive, who meanwhile did not seem disposed to measure strength with the shoreman in a forcible attempt at escape. 
               "Well, I can't jestly say, yet," answered Tom Collins, keeping his hold. "Oh, here come the rest of 'em!-we'll talk about what is the matter, in the house." 
               At that moment so many of the shoremen as had been on the opposite side of the building, came round to the front; and without Thomas Hillyer's being fully aware whether he had walked, been shoved or been carried, he found himself within the room, where the frightened and half-fainting Charlotte was standing with clasped hands that showed a propensity to wring themselves. There, as one by one they tramped in, the faint candle-light showed Uncle Zeke Robbins, his mouth distorted into a comically-Satanic grin, and his divergent eyes at the same time examining the face and feet of the supercargo; Dick Decker, bluff and round-faced as ever, and seeming to enjoy himself hugely; Sim Radstock the giant, with his lips set hard and his face paler than usual, and something in his whole appearance indicating that he had lately been suffering ill-health of mind or body; three other shoremen, their every-day associates, whose names are of no consequence in this connection; the irrepressible Rod, Squire Holloway's clerk and factotum, who probably came along to represent the bar on this occasion, as well as to enjoy a little of that excitement from which he had been debarred ever since the adventure of the "mill-road;" and a thin man, with a very serious shaven face and black clothes of a semi-Quaker cut, who seemed likely to balance the legal display by representing the clergy. 
               Such was the array of visitors then and there presented, when all the party were within and the door closed. A pleasant party, when met for service or good-fellowship: a dangerous one, as any eye could see, when congregated for any purpose of hostility or their own wild justice. 
               Poor little Charlotte North continued terribly frightened, as might have been expected. Twice she attempted to address Tom Collins, seeming to feel nearer to him than to any one else in the company, through his wife; but twice her voice failed her and she could only choke and murmur; the end of all being that she staggered to a chair and sat half stupefied, Sim Radstock starting forward when he saw her staggering, and then falling back quite as rapidly behind some of the others, where he stood grim and silent, his face troubled and his great hands gripping dangerously. None of the others were seated; not another word had been spoken by any one since the entrance. At last Uncle Zeke, throwing a comprehensive glance over the whole assembly and the entire room from floor to ceiling, spat into his dexter claw as if he had something to grip that needed to be held tightly, and proceeded as general spokesman. 
               "Look-a-here, Mr. Hilyard," he said, "I see that there little gal is skeered, and by the white around your gills I think that you have a tetch of it; only you don't like to ask any questions. You needn't: we'll tell you all about it without askin', and with very few words. Do you see that man?" pointing to the person in black clothes, who thereupon looked longer-faced than usual. 
               "Humph, yes, I see him!" answered the supercargo. 
               "Wa-a-l," Uncle Zeke went on-"that 'ere is a minister-one of them Methodist parsons what cures people's souls with Scripter the same as we do our fish with salt. We tuck him out of his house a little while ago, and brung him down here for a bit of a job. And now he's a goin' to do it!" 
               "To do what?" the supercargo, staggered by a sudden fear, found words to gasp out. 
               "To make a married man o' you!" replied Uncle Zeke, while Tom Collins corroborated with a brief and satisfactory: "That's so!" and not all the party heard the bitter curse that ground itself out between Sim Radstock's set lips: "Yes-d-n your black soul!" 
               "To marry me!" echoed the supercargo, while the poor girl on the chair almost screamed out the same words and then subsided again into terrified silence. 
               "Leastwise you and somebody else-you couldn't very well be married all alone," pursued Uncle Zeke. "In fact, just to make a long story short, you're goin' to marry that 'ere little girl, Charlotte North, so quick that you won't hardly know you've been a doin' it!" 
               "I marry her!" almost sneered Hillyer. "I'll see you all cursed first!" 
               "You won't?" echoed the spokesman. "Wa-a-al, you'll hev your choice, you know, but ef you don't do it, it'll be bad for you! Look-a-here, young man-don't talk any more till I have had my say! A year ago-it's a year jest about now-Barney North brung you off from a wrecked ship, saved your life, and lost his oldest boy a doin' it." 
               A heart-broken sob from the victim on the chair, at this sorrowful memory. 
               "Scoundrels druv Barney North away from his home and nearly sent him to State's Prison. You said you owed him a great deal-as you did,-and promised to look after his family, with the rest of us. You've done it, Mr. Hillard-done it nicely! Look at that 'ere poor little thing, ruined in body and mor' likely ruined in soul, all along o' you! You can't do much to right her, for you're a cussed dog and the less anybody has to do with you, the better; but what-little you can do for her, you shall, or wish you had! There's the minister-there's the woman that ought to hev been your wife long ago, or been dead! Now marry her, if she'll ha' you, and be quick about it!" 
               "Oh, Thomas! Thomas! you hear what they say!" implored the poor girl, staggering to her feet and holding out her arms towards him. 
               "D-n you, and them!" hissed the equally enraged and frightened supercargo, "I'll never marry you, while my head's warm!" 
               "Yes, she does want to marry the miserable cuss!" commented Uncle Zeke, as Charlotte North again sank back in her chair and covered her face with her hands. "And now, Mr. Thomas Hilyard-time's a gettin short. Dick, let's see that old bull's-eye o' yourn." 
               Thus adjured, Dick Decker pulled from his pocket an old silver watch of dinner-plate dimensions, evidently the only timepiece in the company except that which might have been in Hillyer's fob. He extracted it with some labor, as a dentist might have drawn a tooth; then held it lying in one hand. 
               "And now, Sim, let's see that rope!" continued Uncle Zeke, addressing Radstock, who thereupon silently handed out from the pocket of his pea-jacket a skein or hank of rope, some forty or fifty feet long, pliable, and about three-eighths of an inch in thickness. 
               "Now you can't see, I'spect, the connection atween them there articles," the old man went on, addressing the supercargo with yet more of a leer upon his misshapen mouth. 
               "But seein' it's you, I'll tell you. That old bull's-eye of Dick Decker's keeps time dreadful; and if in jest ten minutes from this time-what time is it, Dick, exactly,-you don't stand out on this floor, a marrying Charlotte North as tight as the parson here can help you do it,-why then in two minutes arter-ward you'll be hangin', with that tidy little coil of rope around your neck to keep you from fallin' down, from the top of the net reel out there on the bank, which is a mighty nice place to dry other things besides nets! That's all, young man, and I hope you understand it!" 
               He did understand it, to judge by the whiteness of her face; and yet he did not bow to it, if the angry defiance in his eye meant anything. He did not fairly know those men: he did not quite believe that they would proceed to such an extremity. And yet he suddenly remembered, as if some taunting spirit had whispered the thought into his ear-how Hawkins had been treated by the same men for a much lighter offence against the coast than his,-and how they had even dared the power of the law in its strong-hold, by setting fire to the jail at Clayboro to release the father of the very girl in whose behalf they were at that moment acting. These were not pleasant reflections; and how far they might have led him to the belief that he must either marry or hang uncertain; for before he had fully come to a conclusion on that subject Uncle Zeke spoke again: 
               "You seem to be in doubt, Mr. Hilyard, whether we mean it. There aint any doubt whatsomever. Men-hold up your hands, every one of you!" Every right hand, except those of Rod and the clergyman, went up as if their owners had before done things of the same character. "We swear afore the livin' God, every one of us to hang this man, dead, afore we leave him, if he does not marry the poor girl he has ruined!" And every voice answered, as if a veritable Vehmgericht had been assembled in that humble cottage: "We swear, afore God!" 
               If Thomas Hillyer had previously doubted, he could doubt no longer. His face could not be whiter than before, but his physical system could show additional symptoms of terror, and it did so. The sweat started out on his forehead, his knees trembled as if they would knock together, and yet the craven spirit was bold for evil and would not bow to the demand of justice. 
               "I cannot marry that woman, and I will not!" he said, in a voice strangely mingling fear and defiance. 
               "I think you'd better-four minutes are gone, a ready!" said Dick Decker, timekeeper if not bottle-holder. 
               "Oh, Thomas, Thomas!-do obey what they tell you!-only make me your wife, and I'll be the most obedient little thing you ever saw in all your life!" pleaded Charlotte North, again holding out her arms towards him-oh, so piteously! But so far as feeling was concerned, she might as well have spoken to the dingy white wall at her side or the cruel sea moaning without. The only reply to that piteous appeal was a lie-a dastardly lie! 
               "I tell you that I can't, even if I would!-I am a married man, already." 
               "Married already?-oh, then what will become of me!" cried the poor heart-broken thing, dropping back still again upon her chair and bursting into sobs so loud that nobody appeared to hear the horrible oath which Sim Radstock at that moment once more allowed to escape his compressed lips. And why should any one have heard? Who, less wise than the all-seeing intelligences, could have been capable of measuring the untaught but earnest agony of that strong man, condemned to see the child-idol of his love made the plaything of a heartless scoundrel-to assist in forcing his marriage with her!
                
               "Married already, eh?" commented Uncle Zeke. "Charlotte North, don't go on so! That man's a lyin'-I see it in his cowardly eye. Leastwise he'd better be lyin', for he'll be married again, or dead, in a very few minutes more, and they say that hevin' two wives is a State Prison 'fence!" 
               "Seven minutes!" observed Dick Decker, again glancing at the bull's-eye. The sweat poured from the brow of the doomed man, and yet he could not quite succumb. 
               "Oh, let him go, Mr. Robbins-Mr. Decker!-don't hurt him for my sake. Maybe I ought'nt to expect him to marry such a poor little thing as me!" broke out the wronged child, as if to give the last proof of woman's self-sacrificing devotion. 
               "You hear her-she don't expect me to marry her!" said the craven, catching at that straw of hope. 
               "Yes, we hear her, and it makes us wuss instead o' better!" answered the shoreman. "You're a meaner hound than we thought, an' you'd be better hung than married! How many minutes, Dick?" 
               "Nine and a half-ten!" replied the owner of the bull's-eye, shoving it back into his pocket. 
               "You've made your own bed, young man!-Sim, let's hev the rope!" grimly said Uncle Zeke. His hand was upon the supercargo's shoulder with the word, and in an instant more the hot blood of the wreckers might have been beyond restraint, when the sullen, coward spirit finally gave way. 
               "No-time is not up yet!-I have not had ten minutes to consider! Another minute!-half a minute!-I consent! Marry us, and be quick!" 
               "You're a little late, Mr. Hilyard, and by rights we ought to hang you!" replied the spokesman. "Howsomever, we don't want to be hard. I thought you'd come round! Now, minister, before any of us gets out o' patience, tie that couple about as close together as Scripter will any how let you. Leastwise, tie this cuss fast o' the woman: I don't mind ef you leave her a little loose or so!" 
               The preacher, who up to this time had not spoken a word, stepped forward and drew the little book of his church's ritual from his pocket. Dick Decker took the half-fainting girl from her chair and led her forward to the spot where the unworthy hand was waiting to receive her. Uncle Zeke picked up the single flickering candle from the table, after a glance at the supercargo's head and the minister's boots, and held it so that, as he said "the minister moughtn't git to the wrong place and bury 'em both instead of marryin' 'em." Around stood the other shoremen, and behind all, gigantic, silent and grim, Sim Radstock, no doubt by far the worst sufferer through all that scene of pain and wrong. The hands were joined that should have been joined long before or held apart forever; the responses were made by poor Charlotte North so feebly that they could scarcely be heard, but by the supercargo with the loud, curt tone of defiant anger; and in five minutes, so far as the formula of human law could make them so, Thomas Hillyer, the wronger, and Charlotte North, the wronged, were husband and wife. 
               We have before been witness to a strange bridal, during the course of this narration; but how much stranger this-marriage compelled and worthlessness wedding weakness! The shoremen believed that in compelling the ceremony they were at once serving the poor child and punishing her seducer: whether they were really doing either is a question passing beyond their intention. That ceremony ended, without another word, either to bride or bridegroom, they dropped away, almost as if they had been phantoms and the daylight coming. Not many minutes after the task was concluded, the wagon was filled again and rolling off up the causeway, towards the village. And from this page where they have so long moved and acted and spoken, most of them disappear at this moment, into an obscurity thicker than the starlit veil of that September night, hanging over the Topsail marshes. 
               They were gone: the husband and wife, so suddenly thrust into that relation were alone. What visions of happiness yet to come after all her shame and misery, may have filled the heart of the little trembler! What thoughts of deadly anger, hate and injustice, were meanwhile almost certainly filling the mind of the compelled husband! He had stood without moving, since the conclusion of the ceremony-while the shoremen went out and away. His compelled wife had been leaning against the wall, near the door, overcome by weakness, emotion, the unhoped-for novelty of her situation as a married woman. He had been silent so long that she became alarmed; and she came up and laid her little weak hand timidly upon his arm, with words that should have disarmed and softened the most heartless: 
               "Thomas-dear Thomas!-you are not angry with me, are you? You did not so much hate to marry me, after saying so many times that you loved me better than any one else in the world, and when I love you so dearly,-did you?" 
               An angel was touching him-an angel bearing perhaps the chance of physical as well as moral life. He did not recognize it: it was to his bad, selfish, cruel nature-to his distorted sense,-a demon; and he dashed it away accordingly. That pleading touch unlocked the gates of abusive anger. It was with a gesture positively brutal that he flung off the caressing hand and raved out: 
               "Keep your hands off me, strumpet! You think that you are my wife, after employing these wretches to come down here and force me into the mockery of a marriage that you could not beg out of me!" 
               He had again seized from the table his hat, laid aside for the ceremony, and was moving towards the unfastened door. His poor wife came closer, in her fear that he would leave her under that terrible misbelief, and again touched his arm, as she pleaded: 
               "Oh, Thomas-do not think so badly of me and treat me so harshly! Indeed-indeed I did not know that they were coming! Do not go away and leave me all alone, now that you have a right to stay here with me!" 
               "I tell you to keep your hands off,--!" and he used a word yet more offensive than he had before spoken. "You wanted a husband so badly, Charlotte North, and now you have had one just ten minutes. You couldn't be satisfied with me, d-n you, as I was; now you can shift for yourself! I am going out of this cursed hole of a house, this minute; and I never set foot in it again, or see you-that I swear!" 
               Terrible words!-a most cruel promise! Never to come near that house again, after making it no home except he was there! Never again to see the little, thin, earnest face, so helpless and yet so loving, looking to him for light and life! How terribly that promise might be kept, beyond the knowledge of the speaker! Thomas Hillyer, rushing out of that humble cottage door into the night, on your way to Topsail, to the great city, to Canton-anywhere beyond the presence of the woman so wronged,-rushing away and leaving her to sink almost insensible on the broken settee and to sob and weep away half her weak power of life,-to what were you fleeing, less awful than the Judgment? 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXVIII. 
               HOW THE NORTHS WENT AWAY FROM SEABOARD. 
               PASSING the Ditch, (in which we long ago saw the ducking of the Agent Hawkins) on his way to the beach, the next morning after the occurrences related in the last chapter, one of the fishermen resident at Topsail found a strange and ghastly object floating there, at a point where the stream was eight or ten feet wide and contained nearly a fathom of water. With that readiness to touch the dead, born of residence on the coast where so many are ever being cast ashore, he drew up the ghastly object and found it to be the body of Thomas Hillyer, who would not go back to the Wrecker's cottage!-who would not see his wronged wife again, at least with the eyes of our common humanity. 
               How he had died was never certainly known. A coroner's inquest was impanneled at the "Eagle Tavern," within an hour after the body had been removed thither and the dreadful intelligence spread through the village; but even at this the evidence was equally incomplete and contradictory. And conjecture could go only a little further than legal assumption. One doctor alleged that there were marks on the throat, which might indicate death by strangulation: another could see no such marks and believed that the unfortunate young man had met his fate by drowning. He might have fallen into the Ditch and perished helplessly there, in the darkness: he might have been thrown there by some hand which had first disabled him by violence. There may have been one or more of the people present at the inquest and aware of the forced marriage of the previous evening, disposed to believe that the desperate man, driven frantic by the mark thus set upon his villainy, had there wilfully ended his own life. Commend us to a rural inquest, always!-no event within human knowledge can equal it in the infinite variety of conjecture and suspicion-averring all causes of death and establishing none-implicating no one in particular and every one in general! 
               Could those who sat upon that Coroner's-jury have stood near the window of the Wrecker's cabin, early the night before, and heard the pleading cries of the poor girl and the heartless answers of her destroyer-could they have seen the writhing face and heard the choking breath of the outraged father whose face glared unseen through that window,-they might have been more positive in their judgement. They might have imagined a meeting, in the dusk night, just where the Ditch drew its sluggish length out from under the dark edge of the woods,-between the maddened Wrecker, who had overheard enough to tell him that his foe was going that night to Topsail, and the man whom he had saved at so costly a price, to be betrayed by him in his tenderest of relations. They might have remembered that the Wrecker, if so he waylaid and met the doomed man, would have been unaware of all that had passed at the cottage after his own leaving it-unaware of the errand with which the wagon filled with men passed and repassed the spot where he lay writhing and grovelling upon the ground-unaware that the seducer had become, however late, the husband. They might have realized how helpless to stay the mad hand would have been the declaration, made by the assaulted man in a fiendish joy of despair, that all he had overheard had been misunderstood, that Charlotte North was his wife, not his victim,-how certainly Barnard North would have pronounced that story a cowardly lie, maddening yet more instead of disarming him. They might have imagined the few and fierce words which followed that meeting,-the terrible accusation-its angry yet feeble and false denial-the clutch-the blow-the desperate attempt at escape, foiled by a strength always unnatural and then superhuman under the excitement of partial madness-the fierce, horrible oath growled out between the taunting repetition of the supercargo's own imprecation in the jail at Clayboro: "When I do forget it, or forget the gratitude I owe the man who saved my life, may the same hand that took me from the waves throw me back and drown me there!"-then the giant strength holding the doomed head beneath the turbid waters of the Ditch, spite of all struggles, and curses, and entreaties, and piteous appeals to heaven and to him,-holding that head there until the bubbling words were checked and the struggles grew faint and ceased-until the soul of the wronger had gone to its account and only the swollen and ghastly body remained to tell the tale of demoniac revenge! 
               They might have imagined all these things, though the law could find no incident upon which to seize, and though the people who had so long too-well known the foul ingratitude of the supercargo and the dishonor of Charlotte North, would have been little likely to take any measures to avenge his fate. Why should they, indeed?-when only a few hours before, some of their own hands had been knotting a rope to hang him like a sheep-stealing dog for the very crime which was now no more than punished? Some of these people-those best informed as to late events and habits of thought on the coast,-may have seen dimly through the mystery and believed-as perhaps the readers of this chronicle may find the same temptation to believe-that the hand which once saved had at last destroyed, only one year later, by the same description of death from which the rescue had been made, and almost within sight of the spot where the mistaken benevolence had been manifested. 
               The report of Barnard North's landing, being spoken with, and going towards his cabin-before mentioned,-had spread through the section: 
               But no one had afterwards seen him, there or elsewhere: he had disappeared. Had he, too, met with some mishap, and thus made still deeper the sad and involved tragedy of the sea-coast? Some time elapsed before that question could ever be answered. 
               The coroner's inquest on the body of Thomas Hillyer had scarcely been concluded, when his fate was revealed to the poor little wife of a moment. Even before the discovery of the body, the fact of the forced marriage had become known throughout the entire neighborhood; and when the death was ascertained it seemed to be agreed, by common consent, that Mary Collins, the truest and kindest friend whom Charlotte North had ever known, should during the day go down to the cottage, where no visitor was likely to precede her, and communicate the sad intelligence as only her gentle tongue and considerate manner could do. But she was spared the trouble and the pain. Mrs. Pheny Chasey, the same unscrupulous gossip who had nearly killed the mother, the year before, by her false account of the assault of the wreckers upon Hawkins,-and who had known, earlier than most others, with the intuition of the prying and the malevolent, that relations of improper intimacy must have existed between the defenceless young girl and the attractive supercargo,-took upon herself the task of "breaking it to the poor thing," as she called the transmission of the news which made a widow within half a day of bridal. 
               The long legs of Mrs. Pheny Chasey did their errand with speed, and there was no strong-handed spinster Betsey Morris, just then, to put a forcible check upon her tongue. She burst into the little cottage, where Charlotte sat alone, sewing, as best she could through her tears, on some poor little pieces of linen and flannel and muslin that should in themselves have been enough to touch any heart not utterly calloused-burst in, out of breath and the sickly green of her face temporarily changed to red by the exertion of rapid walking,-and communicated her intelligence in that gradual and careful manner for which she had become widely celebrated: 
               "Oh, Charlotte, you poor thing!-what will become of you! Your husband's dead, drowned, and murdered, and choked to death, and swelled up with the water till he's the most horrible sight you ever seen in all your life; and there's two doctors a cuttin' of him to pieces, up at the tavern, to see what was the matter of him!" 
               Any reasonable woman should have been satisfied with that delicate form of announcement; but we have seen that Charlotte North was weak and by no means reasonable. Instead of bearing up like a Roman matron, and thanking Mrs. Chasey for her gentleness and forethought, she merely acted like a weak little American girl-gave a short, quick scream and fainted dead away on the floor! There Mrs. Chasey, who had not come prepared for such a catastrophe, kindly left her lying for some minutes, for fear she might do some injury by any attempt at restoration; and it was when affairs were standing at this interesting point, that Mary Collins made her appearance, driven down in a wagon by her husband, who had not expected so soon to revisit the scene of the previous night's adventure. 
               Why it was that when Mary Collins made her entrance by one door, Mrs. Pheny Chasey suddenly disappeared by another and set her extended limbs at once in motion homeward-is an interesting problem in mechanics and the laws of motion, which we cannot pause to solve. Enough to say that Mary, scolding out the natural wish that: "She wished to gracious there wasn't any law against selling such p'ison sarpints as that Pheney Chasey down South, for niggers!" raised the poor child from the floor, bore her to her bed, and after a time, aided by her husband, succeeded in wooing back the life that seemed to be fled beyond recall. But the succession of agitations and that heavy fall had combined to do the work for which even the gossip of Topsail might have been found insufficient; and within two hours after the arrival of Mary Collins, Charlotte North (it seems impossible to call her what she had really never been-Charlotte Hillyer)-lay still on that same bed, fighting the long battle between life and death, and her mingled hopes and fears of maternity gone by forever! It need not be said that the home-angel, who had filled the same office for her mother, watched by her side through all those weary hours, forgetting that she had a home or another duty than that of succoring the unfortunate; no can it be said what angels of less tangible shape and wider flight, their invisible wings touched with the sunlight of the Eternal Morning and their errand to do the will of the Master-watched over Mary Collins herself, blessing the "pure in heart" even before the day when she should "see God!" 
               Charlotte North lived-lived to burthen still further the kindness so freely extended to her. She was weak, pale, nervous and sorrowful, but never repining. She had not strength enough remaining for rough and heavy household duties, but her thin fingers were moderately skillful with the needle; and if she had been useless even in this, Mary Collins would not the less have cared for her, and the hardy shoremen who had so well known and loved her father would not the less have contributed to her welfare. She could no longer remain at the cabin, after her recovery, and Mary Collins took her home-never receiving a warmer smile or a more sounding kiss from her big-hearted husband than when she told him of her intention. Barnard and William, who had become two stout and handy lads, were fishing and lodging with the other shoremen; and the old home of the Wrecker of Topsail was then, for the first time since Rachael North and himself had moved into it more than a dozen years before, shut up and deserted. 
                
               Another year went by, and before it was concluded other and serious changes had taken place. The storm-winds had moaned around the little cabin as if they bore some knowledge of the sad fate fallen upon all who once dwelt there so happily. It had been locked up by Mary Collins when she carried Charlotte away; and except once or twice that Barnard or William visited it during the early part of the year to indulge a feeling for which they could scarcely themselves have accounted, not a foot had probably crossed its threshold. 
               Before the expiration of that year, not one of the family of the Wrecker remained at Topsail beach or its neighborhood-all driven away by influences having the same origin. Spite of the kindness of Mary Collins and the fatherly feeling of most of the older shoremen, poor Charlotte found her position a hard one. Envy, malice and detraction have an abiding place within the roar of the surf, even as they do in places of other location and higher pretension. Most of those who saw her as she glided like a shadow in and out of Tom Collins' humble cottage, or sat patiently sewing as if these thin, little fingers could never complete their allotted task-most treated her kindly, as one who had been "more sinned against than sinning;" but one could be occasionally found, of the Major Jeff Taddlewick or Pheny Chasey order, to torture the unhappy girl with hints at what had been, moral reflections on the enormity of certain vices for which they had probably lacked partners or temptations, and suggestions that there were "Some kind o' marriages that didn't amount to much, after all!" 
               Fortunately, a few months after the desertion of the cabin, enquiries came down by letter to Seaboard county, with reference to the welfare of the family, from some of the relatives of the Norths by the mother's side, who resided on the southern coast of Massachusetts. The families had long been separated; but some of the leading facts of the misfortunes of the Wrecker and his household had been heard even at that distance through the newspapers; and offers were soon made to remove from the scene of trouble any of the family who might yet be living and willing to accept the proposal. Poor Charlotte had little will of her own. For the sake of her dead mother Mary Collins would have wished to keep her at Topsail; but her own good was to be consulted, and arrangements were soon made for the acceptance of the invitation. An elderly relative came down from Harwich, met her kindly, and took her away to become a member of his family at that place, some six months after her first residence with Mary Collins. Seaboard was never to see her again; and yet there was to be one link between her old home and her new, which perhaps yet became dearer (because truer) than any other except the memory of her mother, that had ever surrounded her with its influence. 
               For one day-two or three months after the departure of the Wrecker's daughter, Sim Radstock-rough, big-hearted, hard-handed. Cur de Lion Sim,-disappeared from the coast and was seen no more. He had borne the loss and ruin of the little girl whom he loved with such idolatry; he had stood almost calmly by when the rite of marriage was solemnized which gave her yet more closely to another; he had refrained from killing the man whom he so cursed in his heart, because she might have suffered; he had respected her grief and her loneliness when any approach might have brought still worse aspersions upon her character. But had he ceased to love her with that mad devotion of the strong towards the weak-of the rough towards the delicate? Had he learned to consider her stained by misfortunes that had in them no touch of wilful crime?-to think her less worthy of a true man's wooing and winning? No!-God help him!-he had only, all the while, been thinking whether the day would ever come when she could so forget her grief as to think once more of sunshine on the sea and love in human faces-whether she would ever find her eyes drooping low enough to let them rest for one moment upon him!
                
               Perhaps there was not a hope in the thought with which Sim Radstock followed Charlotte North to the Massachusetts coast, forsaking, only to be near her, his means of subsistence, his old ties and associations, and forming others with that difficulty which inevitably comes after boyhood. But if he had not, one grew and assumed shape, and eventually bore fruit, almost before he could be himself fully aware of the change in progress. From the humble employment which he had found on the coast, he came to see her at her relative's house at Harwich-came again, and then came often. He was the only tie connecting her with her old home and with the lost; and he was very welcome. She was a child no longer: a weak, fragile woman, but no longer a child. If the old love was not dead in her heart, she had learned to know how hollow and how blindly bestowed it had always been; and when she grew old enough and wise enough to understand that silent, year-long devotion which could exist without hope, ask nothing and bestow everything-it may be believed that it touched her with a new sense of the worth of humanity-that it woke a new pulse within her dwarfed and half-stagnant being. At length the time came when the rough giant, gentle to her as childhood itself, broke from his forced restraint and asked her to be his wife-to let him see her every day, and hear her voice, if she felt that she could accord him nothing more-to let him labor for her and make her a home and be a brother to her in action if she did not wish to call him by any other name. And when those words were spoken, suddenly there came a light into the sad eyes of Charlotte North, that had never shone there even in her days of innocent childhood. Her heart awoke in the knowledge that an angel whose wings she had never known yet called to her out of heaven and blessed her with rest and protection; and she went up to the great strong man and crept into his arms as a punished and penitent child might have done; and so came her second and holier betrothal. 
               Years after, there was a little fisherman's cottage, with the door scarce high enough for the ingress and egress of six-feet-three, standing near the shore, about half way between Harwich and South Dennis, on Nantucket Sound; and its occupants were Simeon Radstock and his late-won wife. There were no children's voices sounding through the narrow rooms or around the door, for all Charlotte North's sad venture of maternity had been lost in one black moment; but if ever Strength guarded Weakness, to be repaid by a gratitude almost better than love, and if ever Protection assumed incarnate shape upon earth, to find its guerdon a thousand times richer than rough-handed Violence had ever gathered,-be sure that in that stalwart fisherman's home the spectacle was exhibited. 
               Both the sons of the Wrecker were driven away from Seaboard County, only a little later, by circumstances closely corresponding to those of their sister. Treated kindly as they were-as noble and manly boys and the sons of one who had long been known and respected,-they yet found their insults and their crosses. Some flippant tongue might be heard to hint at a sister dishonored and a father and mother who had been in prison. Then would follow curses and blows, involving more than the boys and those who did them such gross injustice. Uncle Zeke Robbins, Decker and Tom Collins, all of whom seemed to feel that they were godfathers to the children of Barnard North,-did all that lay in their power to enable them to follow their avocation with profit, and to make them comfortable and happy. But they were alone, as to any ties of blood; and one by one they disappeared, in that mode so well known on the coast, "running away to sea," though there was no legal authority to restrain either of them from following the bent of never-so-wild an inclination. Neither ever returned to Topsail; though years had passed before the shoremen knew that William, the younger, had died of fever, while still very young, on one of his voyages as a cabin-boy to the West Indies-and that Barnard, a mate in the China trade, had perished with one of the tea-ships coming home from Canton, in a typhoon off Madagascar. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXXIX. 
               THE TERROR OF TOPSAIL, AGAIN AND FINALLY. 
               ANOTHER year went by, with its inevitable change, its joys and sorrows, its triumphs and desolations. One morning, again in September and two years after that fatal storm which so strewed the coast of Seaboard with wrecked ships and drifting dead,-some of the fishermen, going down to Topsail beach before daylight, were surprised to see a light in the Wrecker's previously-deserted cabin-shining through the same window at which, twelve months before, the sad sight of his child's misery had been looked upon by the Wrecker himself. Some of them approached the window and looked in. A tallow candle was burning dimly in a tin candlestick on the rude mental; and on the floor lay a giant form in sleep, which one or two of the keener sighted, even with the doubtful light, pronounced to be that of Barnard North himself! 
               It was indeed the Wrecker and no phantom taking his stalwart shape-as they found on the day following. He had once more taken possession of his cottage, after two years of exile; but ah! how changed from the man who had gone out of it at the beginning of that period! Not more sad and terrible alteration in his old home, from the windows of which a part of the glass had fallen out, giving admission to the storm,-and away from which piece by piece of the humble furniture that once made the pride of Rachael North had been removed or fallen to decay. His hair was bleached almost white, and his heavy face was wrinkled and bronzed as if by reckless exposure to tropic storm and southern sun. His eye stared even more wildly than during his days of heaviest trial, from under his heavy gray brows; and the stoop in his shoulders had increased, though there seemed to be little diminution in the bodily strength for which he had once been remarkable. The few words he spoke were short, curt and growling-more than doubtful as to their entire sanity; and he evidently shunned companionship as if the sad injustice of sorrow and wrong had taken possession of him and he hated all human kind. He neither gave nor did any of the shoremen ask, any explanation of his last long absence; though he seemed to know that the ban of the law had been removed,-and though he asked after his children as he might have done after so many enemies whom he dreaded to meet, appearing relieved to learn that they had disappeared. 
               Barnard North, when he returned, had money enough for all his humble needs, and was dressed as comfortably as had been his habit, in the rough dark-blue woollen clothes of the shoremen. He bought a boat and resumed the ostensible business of fishing; and a few days after his return a rough table, some stools, a bedstead and bed-clothing came down to the cabin in the wagon of one of the fish-carters who had been entrusted by him with money to make the necessary purchases at Clayboro on his way homeward. A substitute for the carefully-kept furniture of old-as what was he but a substitute for the man who had borne his name and slept under the same roof? 
               Perhaps it was because he exhibited mon- ey for which he did not account and the source of which none knew-that a fearful report gradually gained ground with reference to him. That report was, that he had been engaged, during all his last year of absence and perhaps a part of the former, with a band of desperadoes from the Southern coasts, in piracy in the Gulf of Mexico and around the Bahama Islands! The son of the Puritan-the man all whose impulses had once been virtuous, benevolent and even devotional,-turned pirate!-enemy of the human race, because he had himself been wronged and outlawed! Could such a thing really have been? Alas, the young Bonapartes loved poetry and flowers better than war and the thought of power; Robespierre shed tears when he signed the first death warrant, the pattering of the red drops from which grew eventually to be rank showers of blood; and there are some living to-day who need not be told that the most desperate of the slave-traders daring God and humanity by the horrors of the Middle Passage, have had their nurture amid the free mountains and on the wild coasts of New England! There may have been grounds for these fearful reports affecting the life of Barnard North, and there may have been none: such things have been told of better and worse men, since his time as before it, with and without foundation. 
               At all events, these reports were sufficient to ensure the Wrecker of Topsail what he seemed most to desire-isolation. Not even garrulous Uncle Zeke Robbins, Decker and the rest of those who had two years before perilled liberty and life in his behalf,-would long persist in forcing themselves upon the society of a virtual madman, rumored to have been a pirate and apparently determined to be alone. Thenceforth he lived as he desired-the object of many sad shakes of the head and many a pitying "Poor Barney!" but seldom accosted and still seldomer speaking of his own accord. He launched his boat alone-a feat which his great strength yet remaining made seldom difficult; came home alone; and transacted his little business with the carters in as few words as possible and with a fierce sullenness which gave no temptation to hold conversation with him. It is not upon record that after his return, though almost every day he met some of those who had been truly "old friends," he ever opened his lips to any, either with reference to the wrongs and sufferings which he had endured or the life which he had been leading since the culmination of those troubles and his disappearance from Oak Island. 
               Several times he was seen by the mound of Rachael North at Poplar graveyard. But even there no one saw him weep. When observed, he was once sitting in his favorite position, with his elbows on his knees and his chin between his palms, gazing at the grave: at another time he was standing with his arms folded on his broad breast, looking down without a tear but with his face filled with a hard, stony agony, upon the spot where slept the wife of his better years. 
               Time went on, and the one year after the Wrecker's return was doubled. Wrecks, as we have said long ago, had always been frequent on Topsail beach: it now seemed that they were more frequent than ever, storm or starlight, and very often occurring within half a mile of the same spot. Gradually a rumor crept into the minds and mouths of the people, not only along the beach but the country over, that the broken, half-maddened man who occupied the cabin had more than brought back with him the old misfortunes of the coast. Then the rumor swelled to a more fearful shape and proportion-that the man who had once been in the habit of perilling life to save the perishing, was aiding storm and darkness to accomplish the work of destruction! And even with this came another, so wildly improbable and yet so strikingly dramatic, that it seemed equally impossible to credit or disbelieve. 
               The circumstances which supported the most noticeable of these rumors may be briefly given. Barnard North had been known to purchase band-iron and iron hoops at the little blacksmith-shop at Topsail, for which there did not seem to be any use in his occupation or about his boat. He had been absent from the fishing-grounds for a great proportion of the time, in the early part of the second winter, during the progress of which so many wrecks on that particular line of beach began to be recorded. The sound of the hammer had been heard within his closed doors, very often, during the time, by those who chanced to pass down the causeway. In some of the heaviest storms strange lights had been reported as showing upon the beach, both by some of those saved from the wrecks and by persons on the shore who alleged that they had seen them from a distance. Then Barnard North was known to have secured from the wreck of a coaster and rolled up to his cabin, several barrels of pitch and rosin too much damaged to be worth saving by the under-writers. Then followed, in the same connection, the story of two men, the truth or falsity of whose relation seemed to decide the grave question in one way or the other, while its credibility could really never be known until the day of the revelation of all secrets. 
               According to that story, one terrible night in the December of that year, two men who had been thrown ashore from a small coasting-sloop, a few miles below, where the creeks made it impossible to cross the country, and who had made their way up the beach until again cut off by Bush Inlet, whence they had struck inland again and reached Topsail village and the "Eagle Tavern" worn out and half perished,-averred that they had seen a strange and fearful sight on the bank along that part of the beach which would seem to have been but a few hundred yards below Barnard North's dwelling, and very near the spot where, years before, Gil Davis had secured the plunder which was eventually to prove so fatal to him. 
               They had seen a light, apparently on the beach, when a mile below, as they rounded a curve of the shore. The night was intensely dark, thick with driving snow, and the wind blowing a winter gale; and they had followed the light. Coming nearer, they had seen that the light was elevated some distance above the beach. They had noticed, too, with a shudder, that there seemed to be timbers as if from a wrecked vessel, in the heavy surf; and one of them had been sure that he saw more than one body just beyond the reach of the undertow. But surprised, curious and frightened as well as sinking with cold and fatigue, they had still pushed on towards the light, and when they approached it within a hundred yards found that it proceeded from a sort of large basket made of iron hoops, filled with blazing pitch or rosin, throwing out a low but brilliant flame, elevated some ten or twelve feet on a tripod made apparently of heavy hoop-poles lashed together at the top. This was erected at the edge of the sand-bank; and at the foot of the tripod they had seen a very tall dark man, with white hair and in heavy sailor clothes, kneeling over some object on the sand. Coming yet nearer, though with confessed trepidation, they had seen that the object was the body of a man in sea-faring clothes, beardless, and apparently only a boy in years; while the man kneeling above him was wringing his hands and muttering words of heart-breaking grief with awful curses, speaking of "his boy" and "his Robert" who had been "lost so long, to come back again at last and be murdered by his father!" The men had shrunk away, close down to the surf, without being seen by the victim of that terrible grief, had kept on their way up to Bush Inlet, and reached Topsail to make a report of so startling a character. 
               When the story was told that night at the Eagle Tavern, though the relators, if they were indeed telling the truth, had no idea of the personality of the man whom they had seen on the beach, there were some present who ominously shook their heads and agreed that the place and the description indicated Barnard North. If this was true, indeed-then the late frequency of wrecks at that particular point of the coast need be no longer a subject of wonder. For two miles above, as may be remembered, stood the light-house at Upper-Topsail Point, on the south side of Bush Inlet, and above that point for a considerable distance, the beach fell rapidly away to the westward. Vessels coming on in thick weather, intending either to shelter themselves in the Inlet or to make the land and run northward, seeing such a light as that described, would naturally mistake it for the light on the Point, and subsequent destruction would be almost inevitable before the mistake was discovered. 
               And as to the body over which the ruined man was alleged to have been kneeling with mingled endearments and curses-was there truth, for once, in the strange reports which had before reached the coast and been universally discredited, that young Robert North had not been drowned on the day of the wreck of the America, but saved by a whale-boat from an Eastern vessel that had been vainly attempting relief to some of the perishing-and carried away by that vessel, only to come back after a three-years' cruise in the far Pacific, and to drown within sight of his old home, lured to death by a false light set by the hand of his own father? 
               These were terrible speculations-how true, no one can say. Enough that they found believers as well as doubters. The Wrecker was in his cottage the next morning, and the broken timbers of a whaling vessel, with her floating casks and the dead bodies of many of her crew, lay along the beach. But no body was among them, recognizable by any as that of Robert North; nor did the most diligent search, under the fast falling snow, reveal any indication that a tripod had stood or a fire burned upon the beach, or that the maddened father could have dug a grave in the frozen sand and buried the son whom he had mourned and murdered. All was speculation, then as at first; but from that fearful night Barnard North lost his own name and the proud alternate by which he had so long been called-he was thenceforward the "Terror of Topsail." 
               Thenceforward, too, he was equally watched and shunned, but without avail as to any positive knowledge. All, or nearly all, suspected: none knew. Vessel after vessel was lost on that beach and the bar lying seaward: none could trace any connection between the Terror of Topsail and any one of those catastrophes; and yet few doubted that some scheme of mad and demoniac fury was ever being carried forward. It was the insane rage of revenge against all humanity which prompted such deeds, if indeed they were practised; for no man even alleged that the hand of the destroyer ever touched property sacrificed in such disasters. The mysterious light was often seen-at a distance: no one ever chanced to see it nearer. The whole affair was a mystery, running into local legend and thence to the disgrace of a whole line of coast and the ruin of the character of thousands: up to this time no attempt has ever been made to give it any more satisfactory explanation. 
                
               And so the Terror of Topsail lived alone-growing whiter-haired, harder, fiercer, more utterly isolated. A shunned, feared, dreaded man, against whom none thought of using measures of restraint, to whom few spoke, and yet whom all pitied in his lost estate. No other foot than his own was ever known, for years, to go over the threshold of his little cabin, of which the clapboards grew looser and poorer every year, while the outhouse where Gil Davis hid the implements of his infernal malice, and where Cain and poor little Nink saw that ghastly spectacle under the midnight moon, had long since been blown down and the fragments carried away. 
               Nearly ten years had gone by since his return, when Barnard North, the Terror of Topsail, perished by drowning, as related in the opening chapter of this narration,-and when the mingled respect and dread shown over his body by the residents of the whole line of coast, originated a design which has only now been feebly accomplished. Long before that time there had been changes in the personnel of the shoremen, through death, removal and other vicissitudes, making the surroundings little less different than those of another age. For burly Sim Radstock was protecting the last member of the family of the Wrecker, on the far-away Massachusetts shore; Dick Decker had grown tired of the coast and gone to the then fabulous Great West of "the Miamis," to learn the lesson of greater discontent and weariness when away from the sea that had sung in his ears since childhood; and Uncle Zeke Robbins, brave but queer old shoreman, with his love of wild, mischievous justice and his hate of Insurance Agents, had removed to that still farther land beyond the great sea of death, where let us hope that beneath the smile of the Master there remained no uncomeliness of feature and no distortion of vision. Of the principal characters introduced, with the exception of good old Squire Holloway still dispensing law and merriment and Major Jeff Taddlewick still disseminating scandal and bickerings, up at Topsail village, and Rod, then Roderick Bates, a prosperous lawyer at Clayboro,-only Tom Collins and his dumpling little home-angel of a wife Mary Collins, at that time remained on the coast. 
               It was from the lips of Tom Collins, then and afterwards, that many of the materials in the history of the Wrecker of Topsail were drawn. It was his son, a bluff, hearty, gray-haired man, with the frankness of his father and the genial warmth of his mother, whom I met at the side of the Aquaria more than five-and-thirty years after that morning of my school-boy days; and it was Lattice Holloway Denniston, relict of one of the proudest merchant-princes of the commercial metropolis and mother of another, her once-dark curls unthinned but changed to one glory of rippling silver, and her face radiant with the memories of a well-spent life and the hope of one still better, yet to come,-whom I saw leaning on the arm of her son as she came into her box that night at the Opera. 
             
            THE END.
