DEAR CLARK, I remember a winter evening when we sat chatting together in your san&um, sipping a mild and wholesome beverage (tea, was it not?), or answering some exaggerated shriek of the passing wind with the mild satire of a peaceful pipe. Little Elliott had climbed the paternal knee, and mis- chievous Jose hovered near, in no wise "afraid of her father." The bright coal fire sent a cheerful gleam through the room- O cosy snuggery!-and made the delicate wreath of smoke that had settled about your head appear like an indifferent halo. It was the place for that delicate coronation. The lapidary-work of this literary Mosaic was hardly yet begun; but it happened that, by a nervous anticipation, I fell a musing, in one of the natural pauses of our chat, on a certain   Dedicatory Letter. after-question which had needlessly perplexed me. At length, putting myself in communication with my heart, I heard that organ say, distinfly, "Jacques, if thou canst not find here the man to whom thou shouldst dedicate thy work, thou mayest go farther and fare worse." I have presumptuously taken my own advice. Considering our friendship, your kindness to Mr. Pepper, and the liberal use I have made of your name in these pages, perhaps it is a wonder I should ever have debated the point at all. W!,en you have inspe&ed the volume, you will have found it "full of I's within," like the Four Beasts of the Revelation; and it must be confessed, that in neither interior can we see much need of them. But it is my wish and timid anticipation one day to possess a greater fund of modesty-or the counter- feit of it-my youth and ripening worldly knowledge lending some encouragement to the desire. Take kindly, my dear Clark, these firstlings of a "vagrom" genius; and share with me the fervent hope that it may some- time "bourgeon and blossom" toward a better fruit. Your attached friend, JACQUES MAURICE.   NEW YORK, Sept. 1, 188.   PREFACE. (WRITTEN BY P. PEPPER PODD, ESQ.) --------0 .. My young friend, the Editer and part Auther of this hook, Informs me that, having wrote a great many prefaces for it-.some Hundred, 1 Understood him to say-and finding the last one somewhat poorer than the first, which he declares was not fit to be perused before a Dog or other animal, he willDepend on me to Do it for him. I gladly undertake almost Any thing for a friend like what he is: but I Confess my pulse runs up to 80 when I Surrender myself to the Task. Preface is hard to write, for the Generality of Mankind. Mankind are not use to it. When they go to write on it, they can Not think of any thing to say. It is Compleatly so now. Mr. M   said' ( remember his words): Now, no Fooling, Mr. Podd. None of your nonsense. Be plain, brief, and to the point. To Say this, is uncom- monly easy; to DQ it, is particularly Difficult. In my Opinion, a Work of Literatoor ought to be its own Excuse or else it should be Consigned to the fire, or perhaps Mutilated by    Preface.                  : Tairing. As long as the Wonderful genus of PEPPER consents tc illuminate a Book, that Book, in my opinion, can not Need a Excuse. I may be Mistaken, but that is my Opinion. But to think Different, is the Lot of Mankind. Mankind scarcely ever agrees. Mr. M   thinks perhaps he himself has not Done as well as he might, and says he is Afraid he will be Overshadowed by Mr. PEPPER'S genus, and thrown into a unpleasant Shade by that Individual That Effect will of course be Produced. Hexpect to share that Gloom with him. But we should be Proud to Prostrate ourselves at the Foot of GENUS, regardless of its size; and let our Gaze wander tp his lims and body, until it rests with Satisfaction on his glorious Feachers. Mr. M    has (1) Talents and (2) Education, but no (3) Genus; Mr. PEPPER has (3) Genus and (1) Talents, but no (2) Educa- tion; (1) and (3) hiding (2) pretty Much. From this Statement- made not without Study-it is so vividly Apparent as to be quite Plane, that PEPPER is (to Employ the Languige of Racers and inferier men), A-head. Upon my showing the Foregoing to Mr. M    ,he Remarked that I had Done it. That is what I intended. I Meant to Do it. I am glad he is Satisfied. He says he will not Detain me any Longer now, and will continue the subject of himself himself, in another Department. My Readers must not be offended if I take my Leaf before an Intro- duction. I act for Another; and when he demands, in a Imperative voice, "Go," I must of course Stop. P. 1. P.

You entered my "grounds" at a Gate constructed by that finished archi- tect, Mr. Podd; and had I not chosen to set it near my house, you might have been obliged (or get in, quite unhandsomely, the back way) to tire yourself in an Avenue dark and dreary, rough, and horribly winding: the clumsy work of the proprietor himself. That modest gentleman (who has stepped from the first person and gone aside to view himself), with a winning smile and bow of ineffable courtesy now opens the "inner door;" and having whispered an assurance that he will be ever at your elbow-explain-   BIOGRAPHCAL. ----- T is all well enough to talk of the ease with which biographies of common men-generals, statesmen, and the like, are written; it is quite another thing when the subject happens to be a genius, like Mr. Pepper. I made that discovery before I had thought of my work five minutes. Had not my good angel served me (proof of his existence was getting neces- sary) I really think I should have given up the task- appalled by my reverential notion of the poet, and a sad lack of material. Indeed, I had at last reached that pitiable state-oppressed by the necessity of say- ing something under this head, and the fear of not being able to say it-I fell to asking of the circum- ambient air, in a feeble whimper, Why was I born? in the received style of heroes (and girls) in a bad way.

I also rejoiced when the second one came into existence. I have been in a continual state of rejoicing ever since.

Thanks, dear PODD I "The World" owes you much, for this; and how fervently it is to be hoped you may get your due I I do not well know what can be added to the com- prehensive sketch of Mr. PODD's. The subject of this memoir had few adventures, during the eight years in which his genius was a-blossoming. Like that of a kindred spirit (Shakspeare,) his seems to have been rather a tame youth; affording no salient points to any but the most elaborate biographer. He did not even steal a deer, or small dog. The tranquillity of his life, during this period, was ruffled by nothing more tempestuous than an occasional thrashing at the  :! hands of his father; who seems, rather unreasonably, to have insisted on having his son do violence to his instincts by occasional vulgar work. But we may forgive the elder PEPPER these rude inflictions: he thought he was right, undoubtedly. And he was un- consciously perfecting his son's genius; for the "Divine Flatness"* is conditioned on a certain amount of suf- fering. Little did the harsh father think that while he "tanned the hide" of his son, he dusted both his jacket and mind! * Mrs. Partington. 1.;   Biographical.        21 Passing over, then, the petty incidents of those eight years: gladly leaving them to some future and more drivelling biographer, we find him  at twenty obeying the now well-defined instincts of his higher nature, and taking a stand on the ramparts of poetry, as one of the sentinels of that perfecter taste which the rude world is ever assailing. How naturally do we advert to his First Great Poem, which burst on the world more than four years ago, and dazzles it a little even now! There is some mystery connected with this poem, that does not attach to the later; ones. It was first sent to one C. Conklin Neppins, editor of a Magazine called the Quog Ladies' Litery Gem; but as he was himself a poet, of small capacity but ridiculous pretensions, he saw how imminent was the cutting of his literary throat with the razor of a greater genius, and was silent. When Mr Pepper had grown tired, waiting for NEPPINS' recognition, he sent a copy of the poem, which he had fortunately preserved, to a man above these petty jealousies, Mr. Clark, of the Knicker. bocker; and with it the following note:  "demosthenes, 4 corners, "febuerry the 5, 188.

See how    nobly the editor there addressed came to the rescue:- - "It must have been sheer envy, on the part of Mr. C.

From the time of the appearance of this poem, the "movements" of the distinguished Pote are sufficiently well known, through his own writings, and those of his excellent relative, Mr. PODD. Hence the author of this brief biography has little more to do. That little he has preferred to divide into lesser bits, which the reader will find prefixed to the several effusions of the bard, as they appear in this volume. Had not Mr. PODD already furnished an eloquent analysis of Mr. PEPPER'S character (contained in his note intro- ducing one of the poems), it would be proper for me to fulfil the whole duty of man as a Biographer, and attempt that difficult task. But, thankful that my labors have been thus essentially lightened, and con- gratulating both my readers and myself that I have now so nearly finished, I close this sadly inadequate sketch, with the expression of my deliberate convic- tion, that Fame--"if she understand herself: and she think she do "-will " never desert" her favorite PEPPER.   ASTRONOMY: IN A PAMLIAR (BUT NOT IMPERTINENT) LECTURE. --.m--.---0-  Let us reason together.--HOLLOWAY. I hope here be truths.-MEASURE FOR MEASURE. INTRODUCTORY. SELECT a clear night. Now take a plummet, and if you hold the string between your thumb and finger, so that the ball is free to move, it will not move, but point directly toward the centre of the earth. To be frank, this has nothing whatever to do with our subject. I may remark, however, that if it pointed directly up, instead of, down, it would call your attention to a number of glistening little spots on the firmament, and perhaps one large one, all of which you have probably noticed before. It you have not, you will be obliged to me for turning your attention that way: and I must say, parenthetically, I think this the dullest audience I ever lectured before.  You will please not applaud. It is of these celestial luminaries I intend now to speak.   28        Astronomy. HSTORICAL. ASTRONOMY is that science which treats of the opinions of people in regard to the heavenly bodies. In the light of this definition, perhaps it would not be proper to call it one of the " exact sciences;" but fortunately for the objects of this lec- ture it will not be necessary to class it at all. The science was invented by an Italian, whose name was Tronomi. As Christian names were unknown in the remote age in which he flourished, he was distinguished from his elder and less renowned brother in the man- ner peculiar to the period, and which still obtains among primitive nations-as for instance the aborigi- nes of America. Like many other scientific men, even of our own day, in ordinary affairs he was very much of a donkey, and of course was better known to the populace by his mistakes than his discoveries. Indeed, with the usual justice of popular decisions, he came to be called "Ass Tronomi;" and, while the name obtained, it was in time transferred from the savan to the science of which he was the founder. He was the friend of Paul, afterwards the Apostle, and died about the year twelve.   Astronomy.          29 GENERAL VIEW. The heavenly bodies have no resemblance whatever to human bodies, or the bodies of the lower animals, and are not necessarily in heaven; but the word Heaven, in an astronomical sense, is supposed to mean simply Space, and therefore may include places which cannot be found in the biblical heaven. These heavenly bodies consist of fixed stars, planets, and comets; of which, those first named are by far the most numerous; indeed, it is supposed that were the stars no larger than hazelnuts it would take an able- bodied man, forty-five years of age, twenty years to measure them- in a half-bushel measure, or rather longer by the peck. It is however believed that, upon an average, their size is somewhat greater than that of the Nut with which they have been compared. At their present immense distance from us, they are not as great objects of interest as they would be if nearer. It is thought by some philosophers that, were they as convenient to the hand as railroad stocks or government securities, this interest would reach as high as twenty-five per cent. It will readily be seen that their distance from us must be enormous, when   30        Astronomy. we reflect that none compute it to be less than two sabbath-days' journey, while some have placed it at upwards of five thousand miles. It is believed by many that, notwithstanding the anxiety sometimes evinced by poets and others to convert favorite stars into permanent residences, they would prove but indifferent lodging-places, except perhaps in the sum- mer months. In the familiar expression "My stars!" one is supposed to refer to stellar property of the above-mentioned description to which his title has been proved, and which has been duly surveyed and staked out. Upon paper, stars are usually represented as having five points; theatrical stars generally have more. These points, in the first instance, are the rays; but it has sometimes been found that the innumerable points of an actress do not make the expected raise. FIXED STARS. The fixed stars-so named by some Yankee, to signify that they have been properly repaired-are now pretty generally believed to be suns. It is a significant fact, however, that many of them have f male names. From their singular habit of twink-   Astronomy.        31 ling on all occasions, they look like so many strug- gling beetles which have been fixed to the wall with a pin. Many suppose them to have been named from this circumstance, rather than from the one first named; but I think that no one can weigh the claims of the two hypotheses calmly and dispassionately and fail to decide in favor of the Repairing Theory-as it has been beautifully named by a distinguished mo- dern astronomer, whose name I am forbid mentioning by an innate sense of propriety. No one should think meanly of the stars for mak- ing their greatest displays on the clearest nights: man, himself so arrogant, ought never to censure the pride of a little star! THE PLANETS. All the heavenly bodies of any consequence, with the two exceptions of the fixed stars and the comets, are Planets. They are between thirty and fifty in number, if we include the asteroids--and perhaps it is but kind to do so, since it is only of late these have had the justice done them to be recognised at all. The planets do not consider it a mark of disrespect in anyone to call them by their given names; though   32        Astronomy. they do not "come" when thus called, sooner than the President of the United States, or a very bad dog. They revolve about a certain fixed star which their own inhabitants have named the Sun; his real name, however, is Daniel Phoebus. This Sun gives away annually immense quantities of light and heat; which is very good of him, considering the pitch at which the times have arrived. In truth, he is sot kind and generous and unsuspecting, that many of his pretended friends are enabled to work him vast injury. The planets are remarkable for their finan- cial ability in effecting loans of the before-mentioned necessaries from him, and coming around him regu- larly year after year. Instead of returning the Sun's light when they have done with it, they distribute it broadcast among their friends and dependants-which perhaps is more creditable than keeping it to them- selves, as they do the heat; and this circumstance would afford us encouragement to hope for their ulti- mate reclamation were it not that they have continued in their present circle of dissipation beyond the me- mory of the oldest inhabitant. These impositions are likely to continue so long as their warm-hearted sub- ject has light to lend, or is represented in the pictures   Astronomy.         33 with a face of such rotundity and preternatural good- nature as must continually encourage them. VENUS, being the only female among the planets, and a very handsome one besides, should have the place of honor, and is therefore mentioned first on the list. It will excite the sympathies of the tender- hearted to learn that Venus has all her life been per- secuted-in point of fact, overwhelmed, with the impertinent attentions of the other planets. It is believed she was formerly partial to one MARS, a warlike neighbor of hers, with a remarka- bly red face; but their many quarrels and fallings-out came to disturb the harmony of the spheres to such a degree, that it was found necessary to separate them. EARTH otherefore stepped between; but while the peace has been effectually preserved, I regret to state that he has been made the subject of much unjust obloquy and reproach. It is thought, however, that Earth will keep moving on-performing his accus- tomed revolutions as per programme till further notice. JUPITER is a very good-sized planet-indeed, quite large for his age-and is expected soon to be old snough to set up for himself. He has suffered ex. 2*   Astronomy.        35 think himself handsome. He is quite vain of a num- ber of rings-only two, I think, after all-which have been presented him by some infatuated foreign planet of the other sex. He is in no way remarkable, and we pass to URANUS, or You-rein-us-who named himself out of compliment to the Sun, at a time when he supposed himself the farthest from the sway of that luminary, and that the title might serve the latter as a perpetual reminder of the allegiance of all his subjects. He is sometimes called Herschel-from the two words her and shell; but the difficulty of determining with any satisfaction what female is thus mysteriously placed in the possessive case has latterly thrown the name into disfavor. Uranus is a good planet. Little MERCURY is page and errand-boy to the Sun, who keeps the sprightly planet about his person, and may be said almost to carry him in his pocket. Being so near the fountain of heat, Mercury never freezes, and thinks nothing of going up to five hundred in the shade.

He has the appearance and actions of a vagabond, and it. is hoped he will sheet off in time to save himself trouble. This I fear quite exhausts our list of planets for the season. I may say, however, we are in constant communication with discoverers (and manufacturers) and hope to be, able soon to swell the number very considerably. MOONSHNE: AN ANECDOTE. One day, in turning over the playthings which had amused his youth, old father Sun discovered a num- ber of ten-pin balls, parts of various sets. It occurred to him that here was an acceptable present for his little planets. So, calling out-"Look sharp, my lads!" he threw them all out from an upper window, in one handful. A glorious scramble ensued. Jupiter, being very much of a gentleman, would take but four, though entitled, from his age and respectability, to at least half of them. Earth, having been unaccount- it the very-er-or, in French, Le Verrier. Some have proposed naming it Neptune or Nap-tune, as its " part," in the perpetual concerted celestial music, must, from its mortal slowness, have a tolerably soporific effect.   38        Astronomy. ably timid on that occasion, secured but one. But the forward and greedy Saturn was known to have seven after the division, if division it may be called, and is supposed to have secreted several more.  What became of the others, is not certainly known. Uranus, it seems, got several-six, it is said ; and some declare they have seen one in possession of Mars. Nobody was gallant enough to bring one to Venus, so she remained without. But the pith of the story remains to be told. He discovered that they who had been fortunate enough to secure any of the balls, had conceived the idea of having solar systems of their own; and having set their globular gifts flying around their heads, in imi- tation of their great patron, were nearly bursting in the effort to afford them the necessary light. This sight so tickled the ribs of old Phoebus, that a fit of inextinguishable laughter seized him,-so to this day it is animating his visage. In the excess of his sly humor, he allowed himself to shine on the little moons-well knowing the planets would be deceived into the belief that they were doing it themselves. It is even said that the infant planets which have sprung up between Mars and Venus are only fragments of a   Astronomy.         39 larger planet which had burst itself in the ridiculous endeavor to illuminate its moon. This, however, is not probable. The lava from eruptions, so frequent on the earth, is also thought to be no more than the per- spiration consequent on similar and super-terrestrial exertions. MORAL EPISODE. The animalcula which infest Earth--called human beings-annoy him very much by persistent attempts to excoriate him, and penetrate to his vital parts. It makes him angry also to be called "Mother Earth." In one way and another, they had at one time goaded him to that pitch: of madness that he nearly extermi- nated them by drowning. He has since been sorry he did not do the work more thoroughly. THe has however contrived another method of effecting his purpose, tiat bids fair to accomplish his end with very little trouble to himself. By the raising of little wrinkles and ridges on his skin in various places, he has divided them off into separate bodies or nations; who imagine that naturally they are each other's ene- mies, and have been long engaged trying to extermi- nate one another. At the latest dates*- there is every * Written in 1855.   4        Astronomy. prospect of a success equal to that which attended the exertions of the Kilkenny cats. They are intolerably conceited, withal; and every nation is inclined to think every other barbarous, cruel, and rapacious. There is, however, but very lit- tle difference in this respect-the human nature per- vading them all. Yet one of these is far too modest to praise itself; it is called the Yankee Nation. George Washington-an individual who flourished a sword in the eighteenth century, and left his mark- belonged to this nation; and so do a great many at the present day. We belong to it. There are over twenty-five millions of people now living in this country: and the most of these are slaves-some to others, and the remainder to themselves. [Who can think of his country without emotion I My enthu- siasm should now be pardoned; for, having carried me away, it has at length in the kindest manner restored me to society, friends, and my subject.] THE MOON, AND TELESCOPES. All nations have united in praising the Moon for Ir modesty and good sense-in both which relations she is quite above reproach, and stands unimpeached. -.us   Astronomy.         41 An "exiled Italian" once remarked, that the moon was more useful to us than the sun; because the for- mer shone in the night, when there was the greater need of light. The observation illustrates anew the extraordinary acuteness and sense for which his peo- ple have been praised so long. We, therefore, take the warmest possible interest in that luminary, and even call her the Moon, as a token of distinction and pledge of encouragement. From the intense desire of astronomers to bring the moon into something like a friendly vicinity, they have been led to the invention of instruments, whose action is calculated to entice her. The Tele- scope-a round instrument, long in use-is in great repute fori this purpose; and one species, called from its habit of mind the reflecting telescope, is said to possess a sort of fascination for her. This fact illus- trates in a remarkable manner the good sense which has been already mentioned as one of her attributes. Many claim, however, that she will come farther for a good refracting telescope than for the other kind; and a somewhat peculiar experience inclines me to this view of the case myself. r   Astronomy.  SOMEWHAT PECULIAR EXPERIENCE. A few years since I sat about improving, and, if possible, perfecting the refracting telescope. It is well known (to at least fifty men of science) that the great desideratum in this instrument is a material which shall unite in itself quite a number of nearly opposite qualities; such as, for a single instance, high "refractive" with a low "dispersive" power- there being a limit to the size of glass lenses, and consequently to the number of rays of light admit- ted from the object, on account of the rapidity with which this fatal propensity to " disperse" strengthens when we increase their size and refractive power.* * ' Achromatic telescopes"-characterized at first as a "lame invention"-are said to get over this difficulty quite hand- somely, notwithstanding their rheumatism. At the time of which I write, I had not seen them. Mr. RICHARD (vulgarly called DICK), in his Sidereal ieavens, speaks of Aerial Tele- scopes: but I have no time for such light matters. He pro- nounces the Dorpatrick (sometimes abbreviated to Dorpat) Telescope in Russia, a very capital instrument. He thinks it is capable of "multiplying" almost as fast as the Babbage Calcu- lating Machine; and that it can " bring up" anything except a family of children: domestic pursuits being somewhat out of its   Astronomy.                  43 Having observed the extraordinary amount of light which recently has been received through the Spirit- ual mediums, I conceived the idea of doing away entirely with the secondary lenses, and of filling the instrument with fourth-proof whiskey. I am re- joiced to announce that the experiment was success- ful, though unfortunate. REMARKABLE LUNAR PHENOMENA. Having at length made everything ready, and pre- pared myself by silent meditation,-not forgetting to establish a communication with the medium by means of a stop-cock in the side of the instrument,-I covered the moon with my telescope, and took a view. For a space, all was darkness. At length a voice of more than mortal sweetness exclaimed, in thrilling, technical accents,-" Uncover your object-glass !' The darkness was accounted for. In my haste and agitation I had endeavored to look through a plate of brass, of considerable thickness. I did as I was directed; and as I looked again I was not disap- 'scope. Mr. Dick is not addicted to extravagance in his state- ments. Of his predictions it is said that, mirabile dictu I they all "come true," as the darkey said of the auger.    "        Astronomy. pointed to find the moon within eight rods of me. I at ouce observed that the " man in the moon " was nothing more than a huge, fantastical erection,-in truth, a house;-whose two upper windows, being illuminated, were plainly the eyes. In one of these windows, the sash being up, a man in his shirt-sleeves was leaning carelessly, and smoking a short black pipe. As soon as he perceived me, he shaded his eyes with his hand for a moment, and then, as if assured, started up eagerly and shouted at the top of his voice,-"Maurice I my old boy,-how are you?" I replied, through my tears,-"Very well, thank you, old fellow,--how are you?" "O, so-so,-so-so," said he, as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand; "the old 'ooman's be'n complaining, lately, and I'm a little anxious on her account, but I'm very well myself." His classic language and elegant tastes at once showed me he was a gentleman of education and refinement. In the course of an animated con- versation with him, I gleaned facts which, while they are unsurpassed in interest, are of the utmost im- portance to the scientific world.   Astronomy         45 AEROLITES. The mystery which has hitherto enveloped these singular and dangerous visitants he at once and for ever dispelled by this episodical remark: "Them 'hot shot' I throw down once't in a w'ile,-how often I've thought of the fun they must make! To see a chap run to pick 'em up,- and how quick he concludes to drop 'em Hand to hear him wonder where the d-1 they. come from, too!-0-! ho! ho! hoe! 0-0-O! ho! ho! ho!"-and the excessive laughter made him turn black in the face. ECLIPSES. The marked frequency of eclipses, of late, has come to be an immense annoyance to him. Many a valuable day has been lost to him; and many a time and oft has he missed his way, being overtaken by the sudden darkness when far from home. He says we on the earth have no idea of the terrible nature of a solar eclipse at the moon. And indeed it must be terrible, in its suddenness, from the absence of that twilight shading which the presence of an atmosphere would induce.   "         Astronomy. ATMOSPHERE. A BREEZE. I inquired what possible use one's lungs could be to him where there was no air?* "( A very proper question," said he, gravely; "it?s a bore to be with- out it: but my wife is musical; and twenty times a day she gives me an ' Air, with variations,' by some windy composer,-and by the time I've heard two or three I don't want anything." On the uttering of this piece of sarcasm, a portentous face appeared over his shoulder.  "It's awful dull, up  here," said he, after a pause: "I wish, a thousand times a day, I was back to your planet." "What!"I exclaimed, in wonder,-" were you    ever one of us?" "Why, bless you. yes!" he replied; "I come here to fill the place of t'other man."  "Yes! yes!" shrieked    his *In reference to this interesting subject Professor Horn remarks as follows:--"It is no wonder that the scientific astronomer can see no atmosphere round the moon that carries vapors of water; the moon is too young yet; the moon has not 5 et matured. The moon cannot produce vegetation as yet and consequently don't require atmosphere to carry off vapor of water, until the moon arrives to her degree of perfection to- bring forth vegetation."

"Hold your tongue, will ye " said the Benedick, sternly,-" what do you know about war?" "War!" she thundered,-"-it wasn't war!-it was that foolig piece o' poetry you wrote!" "W'at piece, hussy!- w'at piece?-tell 'im 'f y' kin!--tell 'im 'f y' kin 1" said the husband, curtly and doggedly, with his hands in his pockets; upon which he ejected slowly a slender stream of tobacco-juice from between two front teeth. "What, you wretch!--do you dare to say you didn't write ' Hi diddle diddle!' and git sent here for speakin' so disrespectful of the moon!" "Wrote 't y'self, wife,-know y' did!" said the man, nervously, and looking uneasily at her from the corners of his eyes. "O-O-Oh! you villain!" she shrieked, with energy; and, with that, ran back,-her "noble form " being lost in the " dim profound " of the room. There was no time lost, however; for I had not yet begun to wonder " what next?" when- "Take that!" issued from the distance-also one of my friend's "hot shot,"--which, to his great joy, missed him and passed out at the window. The next moment an accident occurred. The " falling body"   48        Astronomy. struck the object-glass of my instrument exactly in the centre, and penetrated even unto its heart and veins-performing the office of a purge. My eyes were injured somewhat by the explosion, and became greatly inflamed. When I had returned to my friends, they took the liberty to disbelieve my account of the accident; and invented a theory which, singularly enough, when taken with the wther, precludes the idea of an experti- 7zenlam crucis,--the lunar phenomena, the damage to the instrument, and the redness of my eyes, being explained on either hypothesis. COMETS. These heavenly bodies resemble snakes in being all head and tail. They are unlike snakes in having a very fiery appearance: red snakes, much to the regret of naturalists, being astonishingly rare. Comets lead a very irregular life, and are a scandal and disgrace to all their connexions. We have seen the eagle descend from a great height and take the newly- acquired means of subsistence from the industrious hawk,-flying away from  the astonished bird as quickly as he came. Before the hawk recovers the   Astronomy.          49 ordinary use of his senses, the eagle is lost to sight, and not particularly dear to memory. The efforts of the comet are attended with the same disgraceful success. Watching his opportunity, he rushes down when the sun is so distracted by his many cares as to see nothing apart from them; and taking from that unsuspecting luminary as much fire-wood as would last him, if frugally used, twice the length of his natural life, flies away to his own country,-- wasting incredible quantities of light and heat, as he goes, in vulgar and ridiculous display. He has the unblushing audacity to come back again, after a few years, sometimes very much shorn of his splendor, and presenting a very ordinary appearance indeed. When sufficiently near, he repeats his disgrace, and provides himself with a new tail. Comets frequently rise to that pitch of -variety and extravagance that they will unfeelingly sport two, three, and even six tails, at one and the same time,-flaunting them in the very face and eyes of the injured sun.   But Justice at last overtakes the offender: six-tailed comets are never seen but once. At a time when people did not know everything- which we may suppose to have been before the 3   50          Astronomy. advent of the present generation-comets were looked on with a jealous eye.*   No sooner was the cry,- "The Comet!" raised, than one-half thought there would be war directly, and the remainder that he designed staying his stomach with two or three of the planets. While these induced a tremendous and infernal clamor by means of shoutings, tin-pans,and calabashes, the former ordered an infinite number of MJisereres to be sung, and made appropriations for ammunition and the public defences. When we con- * Much of the honor of having removed such of these vulgar prejudices as passed to this generation may be claimed by Pro- fessor Horn: "Comets should not be looked at with alarm and terror where they appear in the countries of our solar system. They can only be organized bodies, for the purpose of moving out of the great city or great empire of solar. systems into infinite space, there to collect matter, and return into the city, distributing their matter through the solar systems to nourish and compose the young planets. The long tails which they drag after them, can be nothing more than matter they leave behind them; the sun shining on it gives it the color of the rainbow." How plausible the premises, how ingenious the argument, how convincing the conclusion I Mark the play of fancy at the close. Verily, this "Horn" shall be exalted!

CONCLUSION. It is manifestly impracticable to embrace, within the limits of a single lecture, more than a tithe of the details of that science to which it may be devoted. Many astronomers, in similar cases, have tried to get in two-tenths, and have ignominiously failed. I might perhaps have touched off the "Nebular Theory" of Newton, were it not already exploded; or expanded on the "Contraction of the Earth;" or stopped to in- quire if the "Motion of .the Sun in Space" was seconded,-I might have driven the car of Speculation along the Via Lactea, only that my way was clear: but, nilly willy,* I have now reached the end.

PEPPER'S SECOND FEAT. -------- HAVING learned, soon after the appearance of his first poem, that many papers had copied the effusion, with laudatory comments, the excitable poet could contain himself no longer; yielding to the im- pulses of his higher nature, he immediately conceived and gave birth to a sentimental "Solileqy," which, with daring license, he addressed to a "Berd on the fens." Fearing the consequence of his indulging much in hasty composition (so ruinous to young authors), I affected to disparage his first poem, declar- ing he was fortunate in getting it published at all, shorn as it was of its moral, and that nothing but care and faithfulness could keep him in the place he occu pied. His reply satisfied me that I had been officious, and did not well understand him.

Alas i better that she had never been awakened !-in which case she would have awoke of herself, in a Better Place. She came to the head of the flight of magni- ficent marble steps that led to her bedroom-saw her father's stern face glowering on her from the foot- and, comprehending at once the extent of her Misery, gave an unearthly shriek, and sank upon the floor!

Their entreaties were in vain! He kept on. Why did he direct his steps toward the dwelling of Hortensia Amelia? Because his thoughts were there! He had long dreamed in silence of that Angelic Face, and often, of a dark night, had he paced before her window, braving the generally savage watch-dog, and hoping for a gleam of her lamp to cheer him. All that pre- vented his being frequently cheered in that way, was the fact of her always retiring so early.  *   * *  a   e *  a   ,  *   e *   *  0  0  *  e      *   4 What means that solitary rush-light-that angry call-that fearful shriek ?

Further directions, from Instinct or any other person, were superfluous. Knowing, through some superhuman Agency, that the window just over him, in the second story, was the one he must enter, if any-and having a secret conviction that the door was both double-bolted and strongly barred-he stepped back a few paces, and for part of an instant communed with himself.    "     The Anguished Bride. What did he do next? Any common man--con- sidering that the window was upward of twenty feet from the ground-would have done nothing. Edou- ard Blanchford was not a common man.

His very next Action--so Brave and Diffi- cult-has a tendency to make the fact still more apparent. Collecting all his energies (of which he possessed many), and receiving just then some Super- natural Aid, he ran with the velocity of lightning, and sprang through the window-dasshing the sash to atoms I and lacerating his hand to such a frightful degree that several drops of blood seemed on the point of bursting from the wound I HORTENSIA AM LTTA had had a Presentiment that Deliverance was to come through the third window from the right, looking south (the very window!) and for several minutes had been watching it with anxiety.

Touched and melted by this evidence of affection, and partly overcome by the Superhuman Effort he had made, as well as the loss of blood, Edouard asked Hortensia for a glass of water. Casting upon him a look of mingled mild reproach and Unfathom- able Love, she said: "How can you think of water, love, at such a moment?"

It was eve; or, rather, it had been eve, and was now night. Edouard and Hortensia had passed the evening in a state of bliss unspeakable-holding each other by the hand, and gazing fondly into each other's eyes. "My lovel" at length said the blushing bride, "my eyes grow heavy, and I am weary; I think I will retire." Upon which, kissing Edouard affec- tionately, she glided from his presence like a thing of grace. Edouard then rose; and, after yawning wearily, and rubbing his heavy eyes, began to pace the room furiously, and weep- briny tears, at the same time tearing his already thin hair, and rending   70     The Anguished Bride. his apparel. At last his surcharged heart found re- lief in words: "Alas! what have I done? Wretch that I am I Villain I Monster! Cold-hearted Abortion! I have doomed Hortensia, the tenderly-reared, to a life of Misery and Want! I am poor, and the World has not yet done me justice. How can I repair the Mis- chief I have done?

Ah! then we could feel that Music is a spirit, not partial in respect of tenements, but, with a sweet forgetfulness of self, tobacco, and horns, (whether of tin, or fluid mixtures,) ready to further the ends of her benevolent mission by dwelling in the humble breast of a steerer of boats. For a time we forgot the idle distinction of " passengers" and "crew," and united in heart-felt eulogiums on the wonderous skill of the enchanter. The Erie Canal is no imaginary affair-a kind of myth, that men talk about, but never see: it does not float on the sea of idea. Oh! no; it is confined by an immense number of locks; and statistical writers, in their honest moods, call it, in language singularly appropriate, a " fixed fact."

To have a favor of such magnitude granted so readily, at the risk of ema- ciating the conscience through starvation, exposure, and neglect, emboldens me to follow this career of infamy awhile longer. We will now suppose the New York Historical Society to have discovered, near Buffalo, an Obelisk-an undoubted Pompey's Pillar, which never supported anything and has long ceased to support itself; or a Cleopatra's Needle, with no " eye" to be " drilled, counter-sunk, and warranted not to cut," but beyond a peradventure a genuine article, if we may judge from the few feet of it still left above ground. Inspired by a sort of traditionary instinct, the Society above named determines to trans- port the Obelisk to their own city, for erection in the Park. It comes within the limits of our " supposi- tion" to have them consult with engineers, and finally, with any but humorous intentions, quote the language of Confucius and confess it to be "no go."

But aid is vouchsafed. Omnipotent Fancy will I   have a "streak of lightning," the plough of Time, or five thousand Irishmen, excavate a Furrow through the centre of the State; she fills it with water, on whose bosom she launches " scows," ornamented with captains, bowsmen, and  steersmen; she kindly whispers a preliminary warning,--and then, in a com- manding, rough, military voice, shouts to the column, "Advance!"  Every hieroglyphic on its time-worn surface squirms with reluctance, and all its figures "grin horribly a ghastly smile;" yet the Anglo- Saxon energy of the gallant boatmen makes light of the pillar, and it becomes a Pillar of Light: illumi- nating its own darkness by the diabolical glare of interior, stony curses. To the music of -horns and , saving of glazed hats, this venerable Relic of a former age bids farewell to the hole whence it was exhumed, and is soon lowered into, and. resting in, its "Iong home," the scow.

Truly, the "canaler" of early times may be said to have been "clothed with curses as with a garment." But the world, including the world of fresh-water " salts," is growing better: on the canal may now be found many "moral" men-yea, many "praying" men.

There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.-HAMLET. HE  other evening I sat at my table, writing. A little chilly rain was falling, and the wail of the September wind, in the trees, sounded strangely like the hum of a vast mosquito. "Thank Heaven!"I murmured, with much emotion, " the rascally pests will trouble us no more this season!"This appeared so just a reflection, I laid down my pen, and leaned back in my chair, supporting my head in my hands, spreading my well-turned legs with some compla- "ncy, and idly musing on a young female friend   A Tedious Story.       91 who (by reason, doubtless, of the rich, youthfully. pure nectar in her veins), is every season two-thirds devoured by the egregious vampires. At length, rousing from this somnolent reverie, and bending toward my task, I was surprised, and I own a little startled, at seeing an immense, venerable-looking mosquito, resting on the margin at the head of my sheet. I knew   the case demanded promptness. "Thus falls the Last of the Mohicans!"I cried, with less wit than exultation, aiming a stroke with my ruler, "That might determine, and not need repeat." On the instant, the threatened insignificant raised one of its fore-limbs with a deprecatory gesture, and, in the tiniest voice imaginable, cried, "Hold!" "Humbug l" interposes the reader: "Away with this Munchausen-this Gulliver!-Remember we are not marinesl Try again I Get a Peace I How know you it was not a miracle, like that which astonished Balaam, a few thousand years ago? To tell the truth, reader-to confide to you a favor- ite but oddish fancy of mine-I have long believed   92       A  Tedious Story. there are times when it is permitted us, if we then desire it, to have communion with the usually mute orders of inferior creation. That such intercourse has been rare, in these latter years, is no proof it is not possible; and I am sure, if a stupid animal has ever "conversed like a native," a sprightly, intelli- gent, ingenious, cunning insect might be thought to have that power.  I confess I have upon occasion addressed cows or other animals, half hoping, half believing, they would not only understand, but speak. I do not doubt I was always apprehended, and feel a little disappointment at having but just been favored in the way I have desired, and not, after all, by an animal (which was my dearest wish), but by an inlsig- nificant insect, for whose race I have all along enter- tained not only disrespect but hate. You shall presently see, my reader, there mustshave been a purpose in the sudden gift of speech to the insect, having reference to the very feelings I have mentioned. I can very readily imagine your further murmurings of incredulity, and querulous general, disapproval.  "The mosquito had no organs of speech," you are on the point of remarking.  Had the venerable donkey of Scripture? How know you   A Tedious Story.        93 this, about the organs? "But his voice would be inaudible," you protest. I think I have observed it was very faint; and one may readily believe my hearing (which is generally excellent), was on that occasion helped by some peculiar state of the air, or of my system. But I do not think it dignified to have engaged in this effort to make my relation appear plausible; per- haps I should have made no digression at all, and have depended for defense on a note at the end. I am in hopes the story will be found to speak for itself, as did the mosquito. Now I am naturally a weak and tender-hearted man; I do never needlessly afflict or maim a living thing, or indeed much mar inanimate ones. I am even particular to have my newspapers preserved, in neat files; and when one is torn, there is a certain feeling in my breast, growing out of a sense of fitness, just as carelessly torn and lacerated. But a sort of instinct has always prompted me to kill mosquitoes. I have even been led, through a prejudiced estimate, to ask, What were they made for? I own I was a little surprised with the conduct of the venerable insect; but I have since been exercised   "      A Tedious Story. with wondering I was not more astonished. Struck at once with a sense of the enormity of the act I con- templated, I dropped my weapon, and said, "I beg your pardon-I really had no malice. It was but the mere following a habit." "I have no hard feelings, sir," replied the mosquito. "I almost beg your pardon for stopping you, for I could easily have avoided the blow, and left you to your reflections; but I have looked forward to this moment for many a day. Instinct advises me the time has at length arrived when I may safely and profitably communicate with one of your race. You perceive, sir, my size is somewhat unusual; and when I assure you my age and experience are equally uncommon, you will, I hope, be ready to treat me with more consideration than you have lavished on an innumerable martyred throng of my fellows." A sigh, of considerable profundity for such a little body to heave, escaped the loquacious insect, which now paused an instant and panted vigorously for breath,---its former stock of which, considering its volume of voice, I had begun to wonder was not spent before. At length it thus resumed: "I do not imagine that anything I could say would   A Tedious Story.       95 have the effect to change the opinion your race has of mine. Indeed, my hopes did not look that way. You regard us-reasonably enough, I admit-as bloodthirsty and inhuman creatures. You jest des- perately about our 'warlike trump,' and illustrate your hate, in the absence of physical proof, by the uncomplimentary titles you heap on us, and the gene- ral tone of the language you employ against us. Thus, you would not credit the assertion that the droning sound you dread and stigmatize is a sigh of - regret at being obliged to pursue our horrid trade, in obedience to the cursed instincts of our race. We are not fond of blood, but absolutely know of nothing else that will sustain our existence. We must live,   you know."    I was about to quote here the well-known reply of Dr. Johnson to a similar remark. Smiling with melancholy gaiety, and waving a dextral limb as though asking a favor, he immediately continued as follows: "I think I anticipate what you would say; at least, I am sure there was some sarcasm in it. But, could you realize it, we are not without our import- ance in the scale of creation, and subserve a purpose   96       A Tedious Story. by much more useful than any your philosophers have grudgingly assigned to us.  This, however, though not altogether foreign to my design, is not the subject in my mind and heart at present." The mosquito here smiled grimly, and said, "It must doubtless amuse you to hear me speak of these possessions, which you have all along believed were peculiar to the genus homo; but how could I address you, without a mind; and how exhibit feeling, without a heart? and, I assure you, my kinsmen are not themselves disqualified to boast in that regard. "I will proceed to say, my object-which, I con- fess, is a little selfish--has reference more to myself than to my race in general. From my youth, sir- I see you smile again; but a lifetime is a lifetime, whether it be a man's or a mosquito's--from my youth I have been painfully conscious I am not like other mosquitoes. My life has been spent in lonely thought and distracting speculation. The bitter, jealous, utterly uncharitable tongues of detrac- tion and defamation have been busy against me almost from the hour of my birth. The wittier and more malicious of my race have cracked an infinity of jokes at my expense, while the graver and more   i          A Tedious Story.       97 respectable have consistently frowned on all the plans and new ideas I have spread before them. I have aspired, sir, to the character of reformer and philan- S .  thropist. But, alas my heart has ever stood in the way of my success. Had I been worldly-minded and sordid, my talents would speedily have asserted their claims, and secured me, in their exercise, both honor and wealth. I see you smile again; you are ready to ask in what consists the 'wealth' of the mosquito?  What! do you fancy we are for ever on the wing, and have I no home to call our own?'--as one of your great poets, Mr. Bunn, so beautifully and touchingly says? Try and think better of us. A mosquito with an ordinary sucker can draw, it is calculated, in one flight (which may consume an hour of time as you reckon it), enough sustenence from the veins of your fellow-creatures to answer his needs for a whole day. Of course, then, with the day's work so readily accom- plished, he may dispose of his time pretty much as he pleases; and were you curious enough, you might chance to find him decorating his abode, or sitting at the feet of some philosopher of our race, learning wisdom, and, I am free to admit, cunning. But I digress: I have intimated to you that I am unfor- B'          5   98       A Tedious Story. tunate as regards the relations in which I stand witch my fellows. It has all along been my fate to be mis- understood, and (of course) unappreciated. My pre- tensions to the character of philosopher have been scouted, and my general claims to excellence unmer- cifully derided. It is hard, sir," said the insect, with much emotion, and betraying once more some symp- toms of fatigue, "it is hard, when one has devoted his life to his race, to be misunderstood and suspected by the very ingrates over whom his spirit has been poured!" Here he wrung his lancet in agony, and a micro- scopic tear trembled on his eyelid. I essayed to cheer him; but, with the mournful flourish of a disengaged fore-limb, he politely waved me back to silence Having once more recovered his breath and spirits, he steadied himself on several legs hitherto unem- ployed, and proceeded, as follows: "I have no desire to bore you, either with my tongue or my ' javelin,' as we facetiously call it,-and will not, therefore, rehearse the innumerable disap- pointments and mortifying repulses that have been visited on me. I may, perhaps, be pardoned, how- ever, if I mention two of them, as they by much    A Tedious Story.       99 transcend the others, and stand, like mountains, on what I may, in this connexion, call the general plain of my life. Above a month ago, I broached a long- considered scheme for the public good, which I was confident would be received with approbation and gratitude. Expressed at length, my plan was an 'University for the training and perfecting of our youth in the art of pursuing a maintenance with safety and success.' I need not say what were my feelings on achieving but ridicule and abuse, in lieu of that long-courted fame I knew I deserved. 'Ex- perience is the only teacher,' they cried. 'But of what consequence is experience to one who has been crushed in gaining it?' I would respond. 'By my system, few or no valuable lives will be sacrificed; and thus, a reigning fear being quite dethroned, the general happiness must be infinitely promoted.' With equally cogent arguments did I sustain the other fea- tures of my plan, and combat the several objections that were urged against them. But I was a stranger, and totally unused to the employment of winning friends. I failed; was called a visionary; and was absolutely driven back to my haunts by the jeers and even execrations of the people. Nevertheless, I did   i o100     A Tedious Story. not relax my efforts to serve my kind, and in due time was ready with another plan, this time founded on a principle of benevolence still more abstract, but exacting so little of any one, and working such an immensity of good, on the whole, that I fondly hoped none would seriously object to it, while the many would at once reverse their former hard decision, and welcome joyfully my scheme and me. I will briefly explain: I discovered, quite by accident, while sup- ping on the superabundant blood of an alderman, that by a simultaneous mental and physical effort, the mat- ter usually deposited in the puncture, and operating as a local poison, might be retained; and thus the pains I had often witnessed with tears-obliged to inflict the wound, yet powerless to avert the pain- might be for ever prevented. With a heart bound- ing with joy, I made haste to proclaim my disco- very,-seeing in it a new and quite practical means of not only sparing the human race much pain, but, as a natural consequence, very much lessening the anxiety of that race to compass the extermination of ours.' l Noble insect!"I could not here avoid exclaiming. "You will presently see how highly I must needs   A Tedious Story.       101 appreciate your generous expressions," returned the mosquito, apparently much affected. "You will, I hope, believe me, sir, when I assure you that, instead of being hailed as a philanthropist, I was universally derided as a preposterous, milk-hearted ninny, and advised to by all means put in practice my darling theory without delay. There was even some talk of having me privately strangled, as a no longer tolerable nuisance. It almost broke my heart, sir," said the much-moved insect, struggling with its passion, and soon so far giving way to that tender flood as to cease entirely and vent a diminutive sob. My efforts to comfort and re-assure it were long unsuccessful, but finally were so fortunate as to inspire it with an appear- ance of cheerfulness. "I have done," it said, with a sigh. "' The gift and privilege of your human speech are at length afforded me; and I see I have not been mistaken in the one I have selected to hear me rehearse my woes, and hand my name and history down to an admiring pos- terity." "I will gladly do as you desire," I hastened to say; "and it shall not be my fault if you are ever for- gotten."   102      A Tedious Story. - The mosquito, much moved, bowed its acknowledge. ments, and seemed at a loss for expressions sufficiently warm to convey its feelings of gratitude and attach- ment. After this was gone through I remarked,!"Though I have not a superabundant stock of blood in my veins, I would be pleased to have you illustrate your discovery by a painless operation on any part of my body you may select: for, as you justly remark, it is the pain that vexes us, and not the loss of blood." ' Nothing would give me greater pleasure," said the mosquito, with an alacrity that a little surprised me, considering its hitherto air of languor. "Many of our race," it said, with sprightliness, "prefer to attack the feet or neck of a subject, as being usually less exposed to the elements, and therefore tenderer, than the hands and face; but an experienced mosquito is not so particular, and could even get a tolerable living from so unpromising a tract as a thumb-nail." With that, the loquacious insect took the air, and was at the point of alighting on my hand, when drawing back timidly, it said, "I feel it is weak to doubt you, yet I own I am seized with misgivings lest your old prejudices sur-   A Tedious Story.       103 prise your newer judgment, and I should be crushed in the general result." This notion appeared so quaintly whimsical I could not forbear laughing, as I re-assured my tiny friend, declaring that, whatever happened, its person should be held absolutely sacred. At length, appearing to have quite overcome its timidity, it alighted on that soft part of my hand between the base of the thumb and the knuckle-joint of the fore finger, and at once inserted its amiable tube. I could not help observing that now it looked uncommonly like a very common mosquito. In my speculations as to the cause of this apparent change, and general admiration of the talented pest, I now think I must have spent a good half- minute; but then I was surprised to find he had so soon finished his meal. Fancying, all at once, I felt much of the usual pain (and certainly a most pre- posterous swelling at once testified he had not wasted his time), I was about to murmur a little, when he cut me short by this most expressive gesture: Standing on the summit of the living mound his treachery had raised-which, swelling and rising every moment, seemed destined shortly to place him in apogee-he coiled one of his fore-limbs around his ensanguined   104      A Tedious Story. tube and flourished the doubled end of another before it as though turning an imaginary crank fixed in the end. He heightened the effect of this expressive pantomime by pronouncing, in a cheerful, even tri- umphant tone, the sententious apothegm, "Sold!" Upon which, staying barely to wink his sinister eye in an aggravating but wonderfully knowing manner, he took his flight. Somewhat bewildered, I rubbed my eyes a little, although I was never half so wide awake, and groaned in much bitterness of spirit, eyeing meanwhile the huge, inflamed, aching mound of poisoned flesh on my hand. "Sold! and by such a contemptible little 'cus?"I murmured spitefully, as I went in search of some hartshorn.   13 O From the fatigue of " heavy reading" nothing relieves one so effectually as a quiet and tender strain of genuine poetry-such, perhaps, as the fol- lowing :- TO  ANGELINA.

PEPPER'S FIFTH LABOR. --------- THE   poet had long been silent. The editor of the T Knickerbocker had received from  some misguided imitator, who thought to step into the shoes of his exemplar, a poem entitled, "Stanzays Adresed to mi Suetart," and which he had declared inadmissable: exclaiming with fervor: "' Is the sword unswayed? Is the  chair empty?' Mr. PEPPER  is 'himself alone I'"  At this stage, the following letters arrived, and cleared up the mystery. "We    thought it very strange," said the editor, "that a poet like himself, whose reputation has become so thoroughly esta- blished, should be content to repose upon his laurels :" "DEMOSTIENES FOUR-CORNERS, June 20, 1854.

He is playfulbut gloomy: Humor- ous but solemn: Simple but intricate: Pathetic but ridiculous. Sir: I hand you a letter from Mr. PEPPER. It reveals much that perhaps ought to be sacred. It was wrote to me, and the Autograph is genuine. I would not lose that letter for five dollars. "I send it because it contains one of those Gems that have so delighted, astonished, and entranced the civilized world. -It is peculiarly PEPPERIAN. "I send the whole letter because a Gem always looks better in a setting. His setting is wonderful. "The private life of great men is a topic at once interesting and good. Good, because it invites people to leave busy cares and live as they live. It is no damage to Mr. PEPPER, because he will be deprived of the Magazine this summer in consequence of not being within fifty miles of a post-office. He will not therefore see it.

[The origin of this fine old ballad, is enveloped in considerable mystery. It may possibly have been contemporaneous with "Clym of the Clough," or even "The Nut-Browne Mayde;" but a more plausible supposition is, that it was written about the time of (Mr. Pithaddle thinks a little before) the well-known "Robyn Hode." It is certainly a very old and very singular production; and it is amazing that neither Percy's "Reliques," Ritson's two collections, Evan's "Old Ballads," "The Crown Garland of Golden Roses," nor indeed any important work, should contain it. It seems to have existed in Folio MS. for many years, and, so far as the editor can learn, has never even sparkled from a broadside, or the pages of a black-letter tract. From some data in the possession of the editor, and furnished by the very old but still intelligent person who sang it to him, it is rendered tolerably certain that the hero, "Lewys Clarke," was the editor of a (for those days) very good magazine, called the Nyker Bogger-whatever that may have meant-and at the time the poem was written had begun to cultivate the full   "u   A  LEytell ueste of Lewys Clarke. beard-being jealous of his friend "Chlarlys Elyott," a painter, of great celebrity, because Charlys had an uncommonly fine one, of that pattern, and was much admired by the ladies. The appearance of Lewys, at that time-his beard being about a quarter of an inch in length-is said to have been formidable in the extreme. A little boy, aged four years-the son of religious parents--is reported to have been so crazed at the sudden sight of him, as to fall a swearing with great vehemence; which habit it never afterward left off, much to the grief of those excellent people. It died, of a compound curse, after lingering fourteen years in extreme profanity.] ie  first Bftte. x t ITHE (i) and lyften, gentylmen,' And well my ftorye marke; "I ihall you tell of a good yeman," Hys name was LEWYS CLARKE.

F   ON NOSES. Said Aaron to Moses, "et's cut off our noses. Siad Moses to Aaron, 'st' the fashion to wear 'em.'  HOW the above amusing and authentic anecdote has been preserved to us, would be an interest- ing question for the antiquary. Considering the lapse of time since the date of that remarkable conversation, it ought not to surprise us that so little of the lighter chit-chat of these humorous High Priests should now remain, but rather that any scrap could have clung to the memory of man for so long a period. Where Aaron acquired a notion so absurd, cannot now be learned. It would appear that the influence of the   126        On Noses. more sensible Moses was sufficient to prevent the precipitate Aaron from ridding himself of a feature which, however unornamental, was certainly useful, if not indispensable. After reading a statement so dis- paraging, one cannot help losing somewhat of that respect for Aaron which, in a general way, attaches to the cloth. No matter if his nasal protuberance was as homely as that of the little boy who complained to his mother that his nose ' grew pugger and pugger every day;" he could on no principle be excused for sever- ing it from the face for which it was made. And if the act proposed would have been one of pure wan- tonness-which we suspect was the case--we cannot find words sufficiently energetic for the adequate ex- pression of our shocked-nay, horrified feelings. On the other hand, we honor Moses with peculiar homage for his manly and dignified stand upon the nose of his friend. Note his gentlemanly deference to the opi- 2 nions and usages of the community. In his laconic but comprehensive reply he says only, "It's the fashion to wear 'em." It is proper to infer that this reply had the happiest effect upon Aaron. It presented to him the inconvenience of being without a nose, in connec- tion with the idea of singularity-of being " out of ^0   On Noses.         127 fashion;" which, in those-days-when a man at two or three hundred was still thought young-must have been the most terrible one that Moses could have sug- gested. We may also believe that Moses had a rever- ence for the nasal feature, as a feature; and that it pained his sense of fitness and proportion to imagine the human countenance as divested of it. It is this feeling with which we sympathize most deeply in the present article; for the question of fashion has come to affect the shape, rather than the existence, of the nose. It may sound oddly to some to speak of the nose in this technical way; but let them ask almost any mother to describe how, by innumerable pinches, she fashioned the noses of her offspring--redeemed them from "pug"-ness, or checked their banian-like tendency to turn toward the root-and they may be- gin to realize that the idea is not absurd. Beside the notion of mere servile imitation, in these artist-minded mammas-shaping a nose after the rich Mr. A's, or the fashionable Miss B's-two ideas may be mentioned, as having a particularly controlling effect. First, and most widely prevalent, is that of beauty. Few are insensible to the beauty or effect of a well-turned nose. After the eyes and mouth, per-   128        On Noses. haps the nose takes the first place in a description of features. "She's very pretty-that is, would be, were it not for that horrid nose!" or, " what a fine nose Mr. C. has " are expressions familiar to every one. The other idea is that of character. There is a great deal of character in a nose. That is, the nose is often made quite an index of character; not always, or per- haps often, willingly-but insensibly, and not the less surely. Both these ideas will be further illustrated in the following analysis. The Grecian nose is usually considered the finest and most noble of all the varieties. It is distinguished by its being " well planted" between the brows, and straight upon the ridge, and by its firm, well-turned nostrils. It lends dignity and grace to the counte- nance, and is significant of truth, honor, purity, and delicacy of mind. Nobleness, openness, and liberality of mind and heart are suggested by it. It may be mentioned here, however, that these signs are by no means infallible, and the same may be said in relation to those which follow. (My pocket was once picked by a Grecian-nosed thief.) The Roman nose is also much admired, as being indicative of manliness and vigor of mind, and lofti.   On Noses.         129 ness of purpose. The ridge, instead of being straight, is raised in the middle, generally so as to form an ob- tuse angle, though sometimes it has a continuous curve. This variety of nose is suggestive of strength rather than delicacy of mind, and of prudence than generosity. Both the varieties which have been men- tioned depend much for their favorable significance upon the purity of their "lines," and degree of per fection of " chisseling." The Aquiline nose is curved and hooked, like the bill of the eagle. It is usually accompanied by sharp- ness and activity of mind, but is indicative rather of acuteness than solidity. It is also an accompaniment of cunning, selfishness, and rapacity. (If the reader, or his wife, has such a nose, he will of course know the case is an "exception.") The Retrousse nose is vulgarly called the " turn-up." It is rarely accompanied by nobleness or greatness of mind, but rather signifies one absorbed by self. The possessor of such a nose may be witty, sensitive, and "thin-skinned," but rarely generous, manly, or high- souled. On this kind of nose " hats " have been sus- pended. The "Pug"-nose-the poor little pug-nose; what   130        On Noses. need be said of the pug-nose? Everybody knows the pug-nose. Not " big enough to pull," or small enough to be called a wart, it can neither be blown nor worn with satisfaction, and is only possessed by men as little in proportion as the excrescence itself. Napo- leon gave small-nosed men a particularly wide berth- and there was reason. There are modifications of all these varieties; and, indeed, a great portion of all the noses may be termed modifications. Then we have the " bottle-nose," the i( carbuncle nose," the "rum-blossom nose," the 4 squab-nose," the "flat nose," and the nose with the knob at the end. The next to the last named-variety embraces the African nose. A wide nostril denotes a deep, full chest. A very red and highly-inflamed nose is significant of " apple-jack," which is a " weak- ness." Washington had a very fine, wide-ridged Grecian nose. The Greeks are generally supposed to have Grecian noses. Wellington had a remarkable Roman nose, and most Romans have them likewise. John Randolph and Tristram Burgess had aquiline noses. "TUrn-up," and " pug" noses are not commonly sported by great men.   On Noses.         131 A race of people-thank Heaven becoming extinct -called Yankees, have succeeded in converting the nose into a musical instrument,--of wondrous power, but somewhat deficient in sweetness. It is not com- monly considered so good as the natural organ, and, it is to be fervently hoped, will in time be disused. We have only' to fancy the human countenance divested of the nose, to agree with Moses that the nasal appendage is " very good in its place." The ad- vocates of Aaron's theory are becoming rare.

A PAINTING. BY MB. tErtPER. ON   the next page but two, will be found an engrav- o  ing from a "Shove Dover," by Mr. Pepper-who, like T. Buchanan Read, is an artist-poet. The follow- ing  extract from  the remarks of J-  M   ,the eminent critic, it will be perceived, even from the engraving, are profound and lucid, as well as just: "This remarkable work is the first of its kind. We are at a loss where to place it. We cannot, perhaps, put it before the greatest of the ' Chef d'oeuvre Productions' of Landis, the cele- brated apostle of 'High old Art and Literature,'--he of 'the   138    Phrenology   of the Heavens. Capitol of this Commonwealth, contiguous to which, he 'is a native;' nor can it be placed behind that painting; for then it could not be seen at all. It must take its own place." "The chiaro-'scuro effects, in this painting, are very fine: so fine that most unassisted eyes will not be able to perceive them. Mr. Pepper's handling is quite-nay, excessively, free; and he works up his, inspirations with-in short, his brush. His color- ing cannot be excelled, for intensity of blue; while the general tone, considering the subject, is uncommonly moral. Were we hypercritical, it might be obvious to remark, that the best paint- ers of celestial scenery represent stars with five points instead of six; but of course it does not become a liberal critic to notice such a trifling blemish: the artist may have seen stars with six points. "It is interesting to note those little inaccuracies which evince the carelessness of true genius. Thus, the left fore-leg of the bear is fore-shortened too much by about the thirty-second of an inch. But how amply is this oversight atoned for in the extra- ordinary amount of intelligence thrown into the face of the bear I The tip of this celestial animals nose is full of meaning. And the grace and repose of his figure-particularly the tail-chal- lenge the encomium of every lover of extremely High Art. "The accessories are well managed; the artist has them under complete control. Indeed, they have never been managed in quite the same way before. On a careful inspection of certain marks, we cannot resist the impression that the picture was at   Phrenology of the Heavens.        139 first intended as a mere skiagram; but that the suggestiveness of the subject induced the artist to fill it up, with all that elabo- rateness of finish now observable in it.

OWING to the continued operation of those natural laws which govern the motions of the earth, and the impossibility of the sun's rays penetrating the bodies of the planets, it was night in Bugtown. I will conceal nothing: the hour was eleven, and it was dark for -as yet there was no gas in Bugtown, and the moon was away that night, attending to a little business-in fact, pursuing her reflections in the groves of Persia, where she has been, from the eari liest ages, afflicted with a passion for wandering. I am not prepared, of myself, to assert that it was very dark; but I firmly believe it was, because Rose Water, who had been standing for ten minutes on the steps of her father's house, trying to see her own hand, which she held before ner face for that purpose,   "2    The Little Frenchman. said it was; and I have no intention of disputing a lady. An insect-which, in flying about with unusual ardor, had covered itself with perspiration- happening to touch the hand of the lady, just as she had delivered the opinion ascribed to her, and light- ened herself of a ponderous sigh, she added, in a tone of considerable vexation, "And, I declare, it's rain- ing. How provoking r' A sigh followed, compared with which, the other was as nothing, in point of weight and general dimensions-the latter being decidedly longer, while at least as broad and thick as its predecessor. She then went in. [It is probable that a portion of my readers are surprised that I do not lengthen the preceding sen- tence by the addition of the word "lemons;" sup- posing, of course, that our heroine immediately engaged in some unique employment, with consi- derable energy--all of which may be expressed in that brief and elegant phrase. No; she went in, as I said-feeling sour enough, I dare say, but nothing near as acid as the fruit mentioned. Another intelli- gent and acute portion of my friends are, doubtless, ready to suggest the substitution, for "went in," of the phrase "turned in," as more comprehensive, and   one Little Frenchman.      143 savoring of probability, at that hour of the night. I confess I am not smitten with a mania for economy in words. In due time I should, perhaps, have- alluded to Rose's going to bed; though I doubt if I would have been quite so minute, in the description of that process, as Mr. Keats, in his "Eve of St. Agnes." Let all readers leave the narration of the story to me, and read on with child-like confidence in the excellence of its management.] Why had Rose Water for so long a time exposed herself to the night air of Bugtown--knowing full well, as she did, that fever-and-ague was prevalent in that section? It is quite probable that Rose had her own reasons for it. It is no affair of ours. It may not be thought particularly impertinent, however, for me to mention that she was friendly to one Count La Vendre-or "Lavender, the little Frenchman," as he was good-humoredly termed by the boys of the village-who was spending the summer in the country, his home being, since his exile, in New York city. Every one except Rose seemed to think the count of no great account, and found it difficult to account for her preference. [I fancy a sneer of ineffable scorn to be wreathing   "4    The Little Frenchman. the lips of some critical readers. Not for the titled foreigner do they feel that contempt. Oh no they already love the little Frenchman. That scorn is for me, the author. "A man who will pun," they say, in tones of cutting severity, " or attempt the ringing of changes on words, merits the contempt of the general reading public, and the reprehension of his friends"All the same to him, if he don't get it. Losing sight of even the truth, in my devotion-to a whim, I shall go on to say that-] The little Frenchman could count on one good friend, at least, in Bugtown: one whose slightest taste never ran counter to his own; one who delighted to hear him recount his Othello-nian adventures-the account of which would often make her heart beat faster than she could count; one who, to all appear- ance, received the veracious narrative without any hesitation or mental discount: counting the count as honest as any he in the county, or, indeed, the coun- try-not mentioning the continent, as unwilling to countenance that wholesale manner of statement. There I Rose went in. [Which makes the third time I have alluded to that sensible action, and lays me   The Little Frenchman.      145 open to censure on the score of redundancy in lan- guage. No one but a fool would again repeat the assertion.] Leaving her to grope her way up to her room-muttering, as she went, that the various "stories" were I' not so interesting as some she had gone through," I return to the count-whom, by the way, I do not remember to have left. The count was standing-no, I can't lie: sitting-at his window in the village hotel, at the same hour (the reader will remember-eleven-how significant ) and also chiding, but in bad English, the unpropitious elements. To add to the horrors of his condition, the wretched little Frenchman was drunk. Like any other conquered son of Gaul, he did not seem to be aware of his situation, but conversed with the in- habitants of Pandemonium, and other low society, in a strain of energetic, but tipsy volubility, that must have disgusted even the lowest of that class, and estranged for ever the friendship of the more intelli- gent devils.

[The sagacious reader has, doubtless, already guessed--much to my surprise, and entirely contrary to my intention-that our Gallic friend, the vivacious La Vendre, and Rose Water had made some arrange- ment, probably clandestine, to be consummated that night: say running away, getting married, and coming back, repentant and forgiven, after many years, with a coach-and-six, six children and half-a- dozen servants. "It would be so nice!" murmurs some pretty blue-eyed creature in curls and 'teens. "Just the plot for a short novel," pronounces her literary and elderly sister. Ge-nrls, it shall be as you say. That 2was the plan. I swear to you, that was the plan. Let us watch its fortunes.] Tile solemn tones of the village clock tinkled musi- cally and sadly as they tolled: no-struck: no- marked with feeling emphasis the hour of eleven. The hour-hand gravely pointed to the Roman charac- ters XI., on the dial-face, and, in conjunction with the more mercurial minute-hand, embraced affectionately the hour included between them. Soon the minute- r ,.lil1, with ill-tilned levity, offered to bet his brother   The Little Frenchman.      147 that he would give him eleven-twelfths of the whole course the start, and overtake him in less than an hour and a half. "Done!" said the selcf-onceited senior, forgetting his dignity in the excitement of the moment, and at once engaging in the race. Racing was no new thing to them; in fact, they were old hands at it. While this undignified farce was acting in the steeple, the little Frenchman, all unconscious of that, and nearly everything else, pursued below his eccen- tric course towards the dwelling of his charmer. When he had arrived within a block or two of the house, continuing his recitations by the way, the shocked and distressed elements could no longer restrain their grief, and wept profusely. Notwith- standing this evidence of atmospheric agony the pro- fane Gaul continued to rail, until he stood beneath the window of Rose Water. It would seem that he felt a little disappointed at the general aspect of things on his arrival. Though straining his eyes to a dangerous degree of tension, he had not been able to discern the rope-ladder hanging from the window of his Dulcinea; and it would have been a very singular discovery if he had, considering that there was none there. There was no sign of Rose; no indication of a desire on her i    "'   "8     The Little Frenchman. part to change her quarters, even though she should thus secure the " eligible, well-watered and every way desirable piece of property, soon to be sold." The count had thought he had known what sadness was, in days gone by. Indeed, he had often feelingly observed the same to Rose; but now he was certain he knew. While his feelings were getting ready to cul- minate in some affecting speech, the window above him slowly raised, and two young ladies peered cauti- ously into the darkness. "There he is!-he has come, after all," whispered Rose to her companion, as a flash of lightning for a moment revealed the dripping and melancholy figure of the little Frenchman, now rush- ing to and fro in a state of dismal distress and un- healthy  excitement. Was the elopement, then, to take place, and make a happy man of the count, not- withstanding the unpromising aspect of affairs? We shall see. At length, as the accumulative, blighting unhappi- ness of his state, without and within, came upon him with resistless force, he clasped his hands, and gave vent to his injured feelings. "By   gar! zis is tr-r riste diffecultee! I shall be mad I   ROSE VATTARE!  Vous make dem foo-ooool   The Little Frenchman.      149 of me! It is not kind! I shall str-r-rike mon head on ze wall! I vill now r-r-run!"-which intention was hardly called for, as he had been running all the while. ' Nevertheless, it served to quicken the speed of the unhappy Frenchman, who now made directly for the wall as though he were charging a battery; Suddenly he stopped and clapped both his hands to his stomach, losing at once both his color and anima- tion. The bad liquor, the excitement, the rain, and the melancholy had done their office. "H am ZEE-EE- EEK!" whimpered the miserable little Frenchman. "I will go back to ze hotel!" He was too thorough- ly plunged in distress to be aware of the smothered laugh which stole down from Rose's window, and fol- lowed him merrily a good distance. Mightily glad to reach his destination was the Count La Vendre. Shutting his door on the world with its cares and troubles, including a portion of his share in both, the still unhappy Gaul stood for a moment con- templating himself in the glass. Then, with a mut- tered "Sacre!" the little Frenchman, now thoroughly disgusted, rushed to the bed, threw himself on it, and groaned himself to sleep.   t A POEM (AND POET) CUT SHORT.

But when a man, and that man a poet: a man of imagination, feeling, sympathy, affection: has reasoned with himself, and come to the conclusion that Suicide is the only thing that can make existence supportable, we infer at once, that man has suffered, and very likely been unable to sleep much for several nights.

T^fYZ^^P "/V3 Hf E'^   ON THE CLAM. nO  THOU queer creature-thou mixture of meat 9 and drink, and miracle of oddity; thou that art neither " animal, vegetable, nor mineral :" in a word, BIVALVE!--look up, and behold thy champion! It was well thus to commence with an apostrophe to the genus. Let me now address myself to the species. Ineffable Clam!-But hold! what noise was that? Why this fearful tension? Startled Clam, allay your fears; for here no sacrificial knife is thirsting for your vitals. The mouth may "water," the inner man may " yearn "-but shall they be satisfied? The fatal steel is far, indeed, from these bloodless haunts; so are the "pepper and vinegar." In the   On the Clam.        165 light of these encouraging facts, dear Clam, dismiss your agitation; silence your "1," and be cad)m. What! harm thee, dear Clam, after this brief and interesting acquaintance? Rather than see thee in- jured, I would see dozens, yea, bushels of oysters swallowed, and feel no pity. Let us be friends, then; we are friends. There I I knew you would be open and frank with me. Now please be quiet till H Shut again   "Still suspicious." Too-sensitive Clam. But am I doing justice, either to the character of the Clam or of my own sentiments, by this untimely levity? Far from it; all Clam-dom shall bear me witness. It is impossible to contemplate these interesting objects without emotion-a watering of the eyes, and mouth. The genus Bivalve has many varieties, but in none other of these can we feel a tithe of the melancholy  interest that attaches to  the Clam. Spurned by his aristocratic relative, the oyster, and treated by humans with comparative indifference when both are subjects of contemplation, the Clam, by nature sensitive, feels his degradation deeply; and, although conscious of his many and decided   166       On the Clam. merits, submits meekly to be misunderstood and undervalued, and even to have his modesty mistaken for an ignorant and stupid acquiescence. Injured bivalve! Thy delicate organization must needs suffer many rude shocks during thy brief but troubled existence. While thy mental sufferings are of a character and intensity known only to Clams, thy body, after enduring the buffetings of many a rude wave, and the jealous attacks of the injurious oyster, is almost certain to undergo violent torture and a cruel death at the hands of the genus "homo." Inoffensive and long-suffering creaturel Is he responsible for the flavor of his flesh? we indignantly ask; must his amiable disposition change? Must he become proud and haughty like his cousin, the oyster? Must he sink his native dignity of charac- ter, and herd with his fellows, in schools, from a cowardly idea of safety? Must he leave his modesty and the mud together? The meanest and most pusillanimous Clam in existence would spurn the idea with an indignation approaching to anger, if Clams are capable of so gross a feeling. No; thanks to the native independence of his race, each Clam is   On the Clam.         167 to himself a king, and to his foes an armed republic! To an equal he never yields; to a proven superior he submits with a graceful dignity. In times of peace the Clam is a philosopher; and, as far as possible, passes his even, quiet, and peaceful life in lofty meditation and the cultivation of the graces. How rational, how pleasing a life is this! Alas! that it should be perpetually disturbed by traditions of a ruthless foe in the upper world I Ah I could these prove but airy visions whose fabric were baseless! Alas! that dread experience proves them but too true!-A dire calamity cuts short the medita- tions of genius. Into those classic haunts the rake descends; and the peaceful philosopher, feeling that resistance were worse than   useless, drops a silent tear-which, were he an    oyster, would turn to a pearl-and   sighing a tender farewell to his native mud, with Stoical firmness rises to untried scenes in another element.  These "Countried scenes" are gene- rally of a very harrowing description, and need not be enlarged upon-the single word knife suggesting as much horror as a kind-hearted person would care to have expressed in words. Even when he escapes   168       On the Clam. this almost inevitable fate, it is only to die a more lingering and cruel death from exposure and neglect; in fact, he pines away. How melancholy, then, is the compliment to human nature when we say, "As happy as a Clam!" Happy  He is never happy, even at "high-tide." Even upon his calmest reveries will intrude the painful thought, the fatal certainty, of final separation from all he holds most dear. Haplpy! When a man is happy he mingles with his fellow men. But when he is wretched, does he not brood in silence over his woes, and cultivate retirement as his only solace? Tis thus, ah yes-thus with the unhappy Clam I "Wrapped in the solitude of his own origi- nality," and giving his genius play, he may for awhile forget his woes; so do disconsolate mortals. But happy! Name it not, even in a jest. Let us not wantonly trifle with feelings doubtless more keen and sensitive than our own. There is hope that for the Clam a brighter day is dawning. Already a sense of justice inclines the lover of bivalves to victimize the callous oyster rather than his tender cousin. The oyster is gay   On the Clam.        169 because he has no fine feelings. He looks down upon the modest Clam, who does not care to enter his circle, and while rightly judging his thoughtful connexion unfitted for hollow amusement, he affects to despise while he really envies him. The oyster is light and trifling; the Clam, solid and practical. The latter may improve with time; the former must retro- grade. If we must choose, then, let our cry be, "Death to the oyster!" The question has been asked: "Do oysters ever fall in love?"I must answer, rarely, if ever; Clams, always. The ordinary oyster is incapable of the sentiment. There can be no more melancholy subject for contemplation than that of a Clam that is the victim of hopeless love.  What could sooner check the violence of mirth, and jsubdue us to a state of trembling commiseration, than the thought of a Clam in tears? But there, I touch a too tender chord. In the ardor of defence I have gone too far. If, in the absence of oysters, we are ever reduced to the melancholy necessity of dining off Clams, let us treat them gently: disengaging them quickly from the shell, and, without mangling, effecting an instant 8   170       On the Clam. deglutition. Then let us invoke the Discontented Shade, and humbly ask forgiveness: pleading a dire necessity, and engaging to so'regulate our taste for bivalves, and confirm our discrimination of the species, that we may come to look upon the CLAM as sacred.

EDITOR:--There is not a quieter person in the village than I am: I rarely have an adven- ture, and do not often have the good fortune to be astonished into a new sensation. When I am thus favored,--when I really do have an adventure,--why, all my friends are pretty sure to hear of it, sooner or later. Last night- It is really a wonder I have so commanded myselfl Perhaps you'll not believe me, but actually I have not told a single person (nor any married ones); hav- ing determined to be strictly impartial, and tell every body at once.   An Adventure in the Dark.      181 Last night- I am afraid people will not credit so strange a re- cital: it is rare, nowadays, to find any one who has seen the   but stop! let me not anticipate. Last night- I am half a mind, now, to keep it to myself. Yes -no, people will call it an idle tale: yes, I will tell it. It may do some good; at any rate it will be a relief to me. -Last night I had occasion to visit the upper part of the town, and was going up the side-walk, in the direc- tion of a certain liberty-pole. It was quite dark, and the hour was late; so I was obliged to proceed with some caution. Notwithstanding every care, I ran against a post in front of the Doctor's office, and received such a shock as I don't care to experience again very soon. A little farther on, I damaged my- self by a full length contact with the fence, in my anxiety to avoid posts, and then concluded to avail myself of the guidance it afforded. At the corner by the pole, I had taken my bearings, and was about to strike out for the fence on the next corner, when' a shrill, though faint feminine voice called out, as though from a distance:   182   An Adventure in the Dark. "Hallo-o-o-o!" I judged, from the tone, that the possessor of the voice was not so much in immediate danger, as in some sort of predicament, in the extrication from which she required aid; but I had not the slightest idea what direction I should take. "Hallo 1"I shouted, in return. "Hallo-o-o-o 1" again came from the distance. ' All right, it's up the street," I muttered, starting on. I soon discovered I was mistaken. "Don't go-I am up he-e-e-re!" As true as I am writing here, Mr. Editor, it came from the top of the liberty-pole! "What the d-- 1 are you abo-o-o-ut?"I sang out, at the top of my lungs. (I am always a little profane when excited.) "Come up and I'll te-e-e-ell you t" replied the odd- ly-situated female. Rather provoked that she had not sense enough to come down, instead of inviting me up to break down with her--yet determined not to yell again, for obvi ous reasons-I commenced the ascent. I reached the " cross-trees " with some difficulty, but to my surprise found no one there.   An Adventure in the Dark.    183 "Hallo!"I barked, a little angrily "Oh! how you frightened me!" said the female- apparently about twenty feet higher up. "Don't say another word," she went on, "and you shall soon know why I am here." "How do you stick there?"I asked. "Oh I I can't tell," she said, " it astonishes me, too. But I must hurry and tell you why I came here. I've been here at least two hours. I was going by that empty house on the corner, when I thought I saw a light shining under the door. 'Something going on here,' I said to myself; 'this must be looked into.' So I mounted the steps, and had just got my eye well to the key-hole, when the door flew open, and two horrible-looking objects, in black, seized me and ran through to the cellar door. A sort of bluish flame was coming up the stairs, and with it a smell of sul- phur that almost choked me. Notwithstanding my shrieks and struggles, they hurried me down, and left me, half dead, on the ground or pavement of the cel- lar. When I had a little come to myself, I saw that the sulphurous flame came from a large, circular open- ing in the ground, by the side of which sat a being who I at once knew must be the d--1! O! I can't   184   An Adventure in the Dark. describe him To use a common phrase--' he must be seen to be appreciated.' Black, diabolical, terrible, -he seemed to chain me where I stood, by the very magic of his awful eye! -' Ha! ha! old woman!' said he, 'have I caught you at last?-I don't know what to do with you, now I've got you. You'll set all my dominions by the ears, if I take you with me. Al- though you've done me an immense amount of good in this village, I can't make up my mind to think of you as you deserve. I positively can't keep from de- spising you.'" "Rather complimentary,  from  him/"  I re- marked. "Awful,---aifu 1!" she replied;-" but don't inter- rupt me.  'Old woman!' said he, 'you can't see me, by day-light; but many a Sunday morning have I sat on the steps of those temples, in which I am so abused, in order to observe the people as they come in. You should see me skip nimbly aside, at times, to avoid being trampled on; you should see me follow in some old fool who is soon to become my prev.- some sanctimonious hypocrite, grown grey in his whining habits of mock piety,--who has almost in- eluded himself in the list of converts to the belief in   An Adventure in the Dark.       185 his holiness.  At the church up there on the hill, I have been better pleased at one thing, than I have been in all my travels-pretty extensive, too, they have been. Not even in the larger cities, like New York, is spiritual snobbishness carried farther. They come in so late, sometimes, I can't contain myself, but skip about those ample steps for joy; I climb the lightning-rod, and tap softly on the bell, in mock- ery of their tardiness.--That's reverence, is it?- that's Christian regard for propriety, and the feel- ings of your fellow Christians?  Aha  were it not for Fashion, and especially for the respect which those pay her who can't even claim acquaintance with her, I think I should despair of quite a large portion of your fellow creatures. (For the real truth is-it is not the fashion, except in some out-of-the- way place like this, to be late at church.)-But- 1 forget myself. I shall try and like you, old wo- man. It does me good to think of all you're doing for me here.  The bickerings, jealousies, and general ill-feelings you create, incite, or circulate,-the mighty mountains you continually make of mole-hills--that kind of service saves me a world of trouble. There I   186   An Adventure in the Dark. I have bored you long enough. You will stand by me, won't you?"-What could I do but promise him? I would have done any thing to get away from that horrid place. He let me go. Before I reached the top of the stairs I looked behind, such was my curio- sity, and he had vanished; the ground was closed up, and all was smooth as before. Yet such was my fright and agitation, I rushed out, and, for safety, scarcely knowing what I did, climbed this pole, on which I have hung ever since." "Got through, have you?" said I. "Yes," she replied, '" and I'd thank you, now, to take me from this horrid pole." "Who are you?"I asked. "I would prefer not to tell you, till you have helped me down; for I'm afraid my name will prejudice you against me. I may say that I have long resided here-as I find many congenial spirits, and am heartily welcomed to half the homes in town." "I ought to know you," I remarked, "for your voice is familiar enough; but I really don't recog. nise you, and I am resolved not to assist you till   An Adventure in the Dark.     187 you make yourself known." I was thus severe, because, from all she had said, I was a little sus- picious of her. "Ohl well," she said, with forced resignation, '"if you oblige me, of course I must tell; for if you leave me here, I shall die--and I have many friends in this village who will weep for me. I belong, sir, to a nu- merous family, mostly daughters. My family name (it is one of great antiquity) is Gossip. I am some- times called Innuendo (a pretty name, I think), and sometimes, Sneer; but my proper title is Scandal. I-" Al You needn't go any further," said I; "and you won't, if I can help it. Good night, Miss, and plea- sant dreams." With that, I descended, unheeding the dismal howling of the hag (or the assurance that she had something interesting to communicate), and stum- bled along home-having run into five trees,two posts, and an old cow, besides filling my hands with slivers\ from the fence. Whether the "old woman" finally got down of herself, or was blown away in the night, I know not. She wasn't there this morning, and I discovered no   l88   An Adventure in the Dark.

CLARK, EDITOR.-SIR: Although the emotion of joy is yet agitating this mortal Frame, I can at least compose myself sufficiently to inform you that the immor- tal Poet still lives My despairing search after the Body was changed into a joyful discovery of the Soul, still in connexion with that body. Just as I was giving up the search in despair, I found him reclining upon the summit of a Shed, in the attitude in which he composed that most affecting of Poems, the ' Address to a Bird on the Fence.' His eyes were closed: Genus was sleeping. Having with some difficulty attained the elevation alluded to, I Joggled him. Over the next ten minutes, with your permission, I will drop a veil. * * *  *  *   9go    Mr. Pepper's Astonishing Ninth. "Sir: He has suffered. He is now at my home, slowly re- covering from the exhaustion and Misery, which he assures me always follow a Great Effort. , He has even ventured upon another Poem, in which we discover strong traces of his master Hand.

The Arcana of Nature are mere trifles to an Intellect like his. "I never shall forget the answer he once gave to the Proposi- tion of a shallow wise Acre. It was so philosophic and so Just. The intelligent Acre said he had no doubt that in digging to- wards the centre of the Earth, we get warmer as we go down.

THERE unhappily exists a, widely-extended preju- dice against Pharaoh. He is charged with hav- ing hindered the children of Israel from leaving their I lodgings in Egypt on the first of May, thus forcing them, by construction, to stay another year. But how he can have incurred this charge, I cannot conceive, when it is well known that this good king would not lay a straw in their way. True, we are told, and believe, that he refused to let them go: but all hard feelings must melt away when it is known that he was here playing the part of the philanthropist, if the date of the transaction would hardly let him play the Christian. 9   194         Pharaoh. There is a game with cards called Poker, easily to be learned, but wonderfully fascinating to those who engage in the practice of it. This enticing game was indulged in to a frightful excess by the younger and even the older Israelites of that day. It is well known that amongst the phraseology peculiar to that game, is found the word ' Go,' which, perverted from its integrity, means to stay, and stake more money. Now these youthful but sadly profligate Hebrews did nothing, in their leisure hours, but play at poker; and the suburbs of the city, in which they principally re- sided, would at those times ring with the technical chanting : "' I'll GO you three pieces better 1" "I'll Go you six pieces better 1" etc., etc., the sound of which discordant tumult would often reach the ears of the king in his royal palace. Filled with solicitude for the welfare of his beloved people, the good and gene- rous PHARAOH questioned with his prime minister in regard to the best means of suppressing the game, and preventing the ruin of his subjects, speaking as fol- lows:-"I don't want to say, Children of ISRAEL, d-n you, you must stop playing Poker! for that would perhaps hurt their feelings, and indeed might end in hurting mire, which you are well aware are   Pharaoh.        195 very tender. What are you forward enough to ad- vise?"Upon which the prime minister bowed three times to the ground, each time casting a little dirt on his head (which, having watched his opportunity, he took occasion to wipe carefully off on the skirt of the king's robe), and went on in, the following tiresome manner: "Your Royal Highness is aware that your Royal'Highness could put an end to those pernicious practices among a portion of your Royal Highness's subjects " "Stop there!" cried the king, with some irritation; "don't 'Royal Highness' me so much: it's annoy- ing!" "Very well, your Royal " "D-n you 1" shouted the now enraged king, 6 I'll have you drowned in my fish-pond if you say that word again 1" "As- your Majesty pleases," said the compliant minister  "As I was going on to say, when your Majesty cursed me---- "Nor 'Majesty' either," interrupted Pharaoh, get- ting a little unreasonable, which is so very odd in a king. "Well, Sir--you old fool "   196        Pharaoh. "There, now-go on," said the pacified Monarch "I think," pursued the minister, "I think " "First I've heard of it," said Pharaoh. "It's so!" said the minister, being the first record ed use of that now common expression, of which he was undoubtedly the originator. "Or at least I was thinking," pursued the conscien- tious minister. "Oh!" was the laconic interjection of the king. "I was thinking you might give out that there was one word in the Egyptian language, to hear which always afflicts you with a species of moral insanity, and " "What the d-- 1 is that?" cried the profane but otherwise exemplary king. "Oh! it's something you'll hear enough of, if you live long enough!" which was literally true. "Well, go on," said the impatient potentate. "You therefore decree that the obnoxious word shall be no longer used-that word being 'GO.' Now, if you rob a game  " "Ketch me!" chuckled Pharaoh, using a popular phrase of the day. "I ain't like the common run of kings: I don't rob. I 'take' though." Ix   Pharaoh.         197 "So do I," added the minister. "I was going to say if you take from a game its technical phrases, you destroy it. Think of it, old boy I the abolition of one little word, of two letters, will save the twelve a tribes of ISRAEL from damnation!" "Eloquent, saucy, and correct," said the king. So the edict was issued: and unjust history records, without comment, that PHARAOH would not let the children of ISRAEL GO I True, those unfortunate children "didn't like it much," as some of them remarked at the time; it was not in human nature for them to like it. But, at the same moment, they could not justly attach much blame to PHARAOH. Their feelings are perhaps sig- nificantly expressed in' the following couplet, which, at jovial meetings of the grand-children of ISRAEL, was wont to be given as a toast, and drunk with groans, and other more antique demonstrations of disapproval: "LET the toast ne'er vary, O, 'Insanity' to PHARAOH!" in which amusing lines many affirm to discover only a playful allusion to the innocent ruse of the king.   198'        Pharaoh. Many other things might be mentioned of our hero; as, for instance, his having given its name to the neighboring sea, from a bright expression of his little son, then just three years, ten months, and nine days old; who, being taken for the first time near the water, thought he detected a vermilionish shade in it, and in his laconic way cried out: "Red I See!" But PHARAOH was not one to be talked about like any common man. We are apt to insult the shades of great men by "letting on" all we know about them. This is wrong. One other little incident may be mentioned, which, as it wound up PHARAOH, may serve to wind up this sketch of him. PHARAOH, it is well known, was drowned one fine winter, while skating on the Red Sea. He was follow- ing MosES, who had " dared" him; but being a much "heftier man than what MOSES was," unfortunately "went under" at a thin place, at the same going over Jordan; which (what with his skates, etc.) we may imagine to have been rather " a hard road to travel" than otherwise, particularly as that river was not yet frozen over. It is related that MOSES went on, un- consciously, for a dozen miles or more, and then,   Pharaoh.        199 thinking it was " mighty still behind," turns around, and finding a reason for it, says: "Where's PHA- RAOH?"We may fancy the inimitable sly humor which MOSES threw into this remark, as he undoubt- edly fancied he had " distanced him," and knew well enough where he was. He had " rather left him." PHARAOH was a good man. Let him requiescat if he wants to, selecting for the locality, C, or any other convenient Red letter of the alphabet.   DECEMBER IN THE COUNTRY. r           -------- THESE falling flakes, which fill the street- With mud, Cover your cow, which slowly chews Its cud, With such a coat!-so white, and neat l-- In spite of this defence against the dews She must feel cold.

BY A QUONDAM EDITOR. ---0--- THE   LONG  AND  SHORT  OF IT. /ILHELMNA     ERNESTINA.--Will the Editor of the Prime Mover tell me what is to be done with a silly fel- low, who lives opposite us, and does nothing, all day, but sit in his window and stare at me and my sisters? Is there no way of stopping his impertinence? A   way-and an effectual one--occurs to us at once. Let the sisters persuade their father to remove to some other quarter of the city, without letting the young man know  the new locality. It must be a   serious annoyance to our fair (she must be fair) correspondent, and her (perhaps) equally fair sisters, to be bored throughout the whole of every day, in the manner   Answers to Correspondents.    213 described. We presume the young man is the son of wealthy parents; that he has discovered the secret of living without food or exercise, and that news and knowledge come to him by intuition. We judge this from the described inveteracy of the youth's habits. We have not the right to suggest that Wilhelmina Ernestina and her sisters may look through some others of the (no doubt) numerous windows in their house, or else for a few days absent themselves from their accustomed -and (it seems) habitual seats-that the enamored youth may either die of grief, or get the impression that they have gone to the country, and so go to the country too. We say we have not the right to make the above suggestions, because we fancy it would be impertinent. The sisters have doubtless long ago discovered and rejected all our plans in turn, except, we think, the first-of which we take new oc- casion to remind them. Were we of a violent temper, "sudden and quick in quarrel," and much more to the same effect, we should perhaps have advised our correspondent to procure the assassination of the offender, or resort to some dreadful display of ven- geance more condign and signal. Doubtless the pull- ing-out of his nails with red hot pincers, would very   214    Answers to Correspondents. soon have occurred to us as extremely suitable-but perhaps not, on the whole, so significant as searing his eyeballs with a fiery instrument prepared for that purpose. But we are naturally phlegmatic, and are now very cool; consequently we do not think a re- sort to these extreme measures quite the thing, how- ever just or beautiful in idea. We cling to our first suggestion; with a last reference to which, we take our leave of the ladies-not forgetting our best bow and simper. FITZ JAMES FITZ JAMES.-I am an idler, for it is my disposi- tion-my nature, to be lazy. My excuse is, I can afford to be the drone I have described; and, furthermore, I have an " aim in life," notwithstanding. I am an observer of men (and women) and manners. I am a philosopher; I intend to be a novelist. I have been engaged making a study of three frights, who live op- posite, and have ogled me, by the half day, for many weeks. They appear to be eaten up with pride and vanity, and are so idle and worthless, not to say unornamental, they must certainly be a burthen, as they are a disgrace, to their parents. It has been their habit, till recently, to divide their attention between me and the passers-by in the street. Every young man, of more than passable appearance-especially if his apparent condition betokens wealth, is subjected to the battery of their glances, and sought to be enticed by their immodest charms. The young (?)   Answers to Correspondents.       215 ladies seem at last to despair of any important impression on me, and have come to affect a prudish indignation whenever they catch my admiring gaze. As my studies in that quarter are now complete, I turn them over to you, Mr. Editor, and antici- pate at your hands such a management of their case as shall happily result (to all appearance) in a salutary reform. If Fitz James's description of the three (idle) graces be correct, we do not accept his offer to " turn them over" to us. We should be in a sad case to know what to do with such   unproductive property. Our plan is this:-Of course everybody, including every idle young lady, reads the Prime Mover. Let the three graces see Fitz James's letter. It will make them very indignant-perhaps, for a while, furious; but it will do them good. They will then see themselves as others see them: a most desirable realization. But if F. J. F. J. has exaggerated his picture in any par- ticular, we warn him of perilous consequences. We will not interpose to save him-he must miserably perish. SORROWS OF AN ORGAN-GRINDER. DEAR MR. PRIME MOVER:-I am a poor Italian. The Italians, you are aware, are born in Italyr:--0 Italy-my country l- shall I never, &c.   216    Answers to Correspondents. Forgive my emotion: I was once, sir, a Duke. I owned an island near Corsica, and was a man of considerable conse- quence. One day my island-with castle, horses, cattle, domes- tics, fowls, wife, park, children, summer-house, servants-in fine, everything I had in the world, sunk in the sea, [which is very- deep there;] and when I came back at night in my boat, [I had been gone since breakfast,] I missed my possessions very much. I had a horse that I perfectly idolized. I became exceedingly mad. "I will have some of them," I shouted, very loud; and letting down a rope with a hook at the end, I drew up, at the third haul, the very organ which I now turn for you and my other friends. "It has been my plaything in happier days; now it shall be my support and solace," I again spoke, [very loud,] to the surrounding sea. I rowed to the main-land quite cheerfully, and commenced my travels. I need not tell you I at last arrived at the Land of the Free, &c., for happily my presence confirms my story, and makes all further proof superfluous. I find, much to my sorrow and grief, [also astonishment,] that the organ is not reverenced in this land as it is in Italy. Oh, Italy! when shall I see thee? &c. I find, here, that to guide the delicate ventages of the Organ's sweet-toned stops, is not a dignified and respectable employment. Alas I where is the taste of America? in which land I am hailed with indecent familiarity by even policemen- whose savage tones, as they hoarsely shout " move on I " indicate contempt, and awaken the Italian blood in my Ducal veins. Are   Answers to Correspondents.       217 they respectful enough to a Duke, even granting that Duke is in exile, and has lost his possessions?- My talented countrymen Bellini, Rossini, Verdi and Doni- zetti, [most melodious of them all; you ought to hear me play his Finale to Lucia ] are not understood in thii country by the mass of the people. When I interpret their divine melodies, even my sweetest cadences, my most graceful turns, are all unheeded, unappreciated. A vulgar copper or two is all I get for Rossinil a curse may follow Bellini I a contemptuous "get out " is almost certain to insult the name of Donizetti. Why is this? ANGELO PAESIELLO GORGONI. Sure enough--why is it? GORGONI has ground out a pitiable case. We are afraid the mischief lies deep (probably in the pedal-base) among the organic elements of society. Mankind have many wretched quips and cranks to answer for, and among them are prominent those which are turned at the expense of the organ-grinder. Some organs, we confess it, are intolerable; they are out of tune, and out of place, always. Their tone is squeaky, and their average harmony very inharmo- nious. But (how providential!) there are degrees in organic excellence, or perhaps we should say demerit; and there are -some we tolerate-nay, admire. To 10   218    Answers to Correspondents. this latter class we gladly believe Gorgoni's organ belongs. We think no one can reasonably include, in one sweeping denunciation, the whole class of these instruments, since Thalberg has seen fit to play on a French musical contrivance that cannot compare, in tone, with some street organs we have heard, and thus dignified an occupation which before, as Angelo Paesiello intimates, has not been in much repute among us. There may be a " brighter day dawning " for our Ducal correspondent and his fellows-for the common run of whom we sincerely wish better organs, more willing and liberal listeners, and the completest ex- emption from the sneers, taunts, kicks and general injurious and prejudicial treatment of the world. Selah. A&.. \^   Mr. PEPPER'S AMAZING ELEVENTH. o---- PERHAPS it may be doubted by some over-saga- cious critics, whether Mr. Pepper--K. N. Pep- per, Esq.-is really the author of the subjoined great work.  I see no other way but to let these people go on doubting. If the internal evidence of its authenti- city is not strong enough  to satisfy them, I firmly believe that even a sight of the poet himself-swear- ing by a large-sized terrapin-would fail to convince them. Perhaps, infact, there is no real foundation for this fancy. I sincerely hope it is but a fancy. TIRKEL:   A POME. DEDEOAIT TO MR. HBULTON INTO 3 PARTS. PART THE 1TH.

The earth is * As it would be a pity should any part of this valuable paper fail of its due effect, I will do what I can to elucidate it by annexing such portions of the note by which it was origi- nally introduced to the public, as have a particular bearing on -t    the subject. Mr. Podd "was recently much struck with a brief literary work entitled 'A  hort Treatise on the County of C nondaga, and written exclusively by Dr. Thomson, of that county, botanic physician, probably with his left hand tied behind. Mr.   232        To the World. round, as we see: eclipses showing it, through smoked glass, at the proper seasons.   The seasons are four, viz.: Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter,- the last being the coldest. People have been frozen to death in this season. Seasoning is used in Victuals. Victuals cannot be eat on a full Stomach. [What say the Geologists: Red Sandstone is the oldest Rock in P. reveres the world's Benefactor and Friend, now that he has perused the pamphlet I have mentioned, and in the effusion I annex has, in his humble way (as he modestly says), emulated the classic model afforded in the Doctor's style. Mr. Podd desires me, however, to disclaim for him any hopes of having attained to real excellence, in this composition; and to say that all he really expects is some slight credit for having called the attention of men to one greater than he, and whom, he thinks, the world should not willingly let die-if herbs and praise can save him. "The Doctor's powerful essay is addressed to a reasonably large and somewhat comprehensive circle of acquaintance; thus:- "1st, To the Ladies. "2d, Mechanics, Farmers, Lakes, Rivers, Mills, Soil, Roots EHerbs, Crops, Rocks, Gravel, Land, Clay, Brick [being a thoroughly-baked one himself], Lime, Plaster, and Salt.' "Mr. Podd's is addressed simply ' To the World. "   To the World.        233 the world. It is called Red Sandstone because it is Red and Sandy. Here we see its advantage over Hair. Hair never being Red and Sandy at the s me time.] To return to the Stomach': This we could not do if the Stomach was full. FIRST FOR THE STOMACHS. Suppose a Man: Tliis we have a Right to do. Agree that he has a Stomach: Man being a Digestive Animfl. Reflect that this Stomach may be abused: Not by low Language, but by high Diet. Poor Stummy [which playful Term means Stomach], he gits Sick. Is not here a call for the healer? No more (at present) for the Stomachs. AGAIN FOR HERBS. The World has places where vegetable Substances grows: These are Plants.   Plants: Herbs. The transition is effected in a Minute, because there is no transition to make. Now, suppose an Herb. Agree that it has got into it a Juice i Which stands to Rea- son. Allow a Medicine in the Juice that hits Sto- machs.

In a commanding method, he says to the Stomach: Gil Well!   The tone of his Voice gives tone to the Stomach, and he proposes to Heal all Diseases, at a very low Charge : Considering first the number of Stomachs.     Next the World growing such immense quantities of Herbs: Which are for the Healing of the Nations. No more for the Herbs and Stomachs. ODE TO DISEASE. It is important that you should be cured.

HAVE been told that, soon after the completic of the "Tirkel," a very happy accident prevents the sudden extinction of the fire in Mr. Peppe breast, and consequent vainless sighing of the wol for a few more poems " of the same sort." Havi actually resolved on self-destruction, as intimated his last work, he stood, tall in his desperation a stockings, on the brink of a fearful precipice-a te: ble illustration of the lengths to which poor hun nature may be driven. Swinging his arms w mournful energy, he began, with awful meaning, well-known couplet:- "One, to begin; two, to show; Three, to make ready; and"---   , -  Pepper Redivivus.        237 "Four, not to go!" shouted Mr. Podd, who that in. stant arrived, in time to complete the thrilling extract and perform (himself being the only instrument) a thrilling extraction: viz., his friend from the jaws of Death! (The best professional dentist in the world would have called for his forceps.) Seizing the des- perate Pepper, he made the glad announcement that old Walters was dead,  and Hannah Jane free! That the terrible revulsion of feeling produced in the poet's breast by this overwhelming news, should have caused him to swoon with joy-who can wonder? He did swoon. About the next thing he did, when he had revived, I should judge to have been some, thing that made the following note and poem possible, even in the natural cause of events:-* North-Demosthenes, Sept. 15,1857.

"Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words That ever blotted paper."-MERCHANT OF VENICE. "Punster: A quibbler, a low wit."--WALKER. I AM   melancholy when I think how  often time and ingenuity are wasted, in efforts to distort words from  their legitimate meanings and achieve a question- able popularity by the paltry trick of childish plays upon   words.

How glad I am to know (as I have lately learned) the vice is not so rooted in his nature, by the practice of a long life, that it may not in time be extirpated! In that benevolent hope, I indulge the youth (for he is no more), and consent to the in- evitable disfigurement of this volume, both to please him, and afford the world the startling evidence of his present dreadful condition. It will be seen, that he rarely or never arrives at a good pun (if such an adjective may be coupled with so very common a noun), nor indeed does he seem to aim that way; but contents himself with wretchedly lack-lustre quibbles and forced conjunctions of similar sounds. Below is his wretched effusion; but I am not in haste to reach it.-I think he should never die: at least his shade (when he does) should "keep shady" when Dr. Johnson's approaches. (How true it is, that "evil ' communications' corrupt good manners"--and habits! I have caught myself at last indulging in the pitiful luxury of a pun! I am consoled by the reflection that it is a very good one, when compared with his, and by the resolution I herewith firmly make, never to attempt another). Indeed, from a horrible discovery I have this day made, I think he   A  Warning.         241 will never die. He called upon me, and in the course of our brief conversation confessed he was once guilty of an act still more criminal than the composing that piece.   Then I said, commiserating the poor wretch, "Sir, if you are the Wandering Jew, heaven help you." His brief and melancholy reply was: "* I am!" --and sighing deeply, he vanished with a sad grace.

AS I grow older-I am so old, now, I am almost a fool,-my taste for really fine writing grows stronger and stronger. An elegant piece of composi- tion affects me much as a fine painting does. I pre- sume, reader, you are impatient to know my ideal of fine writing. I am not only impatient but anxious to lay that ideal before you. If you have thought but little on this subject, you will be amazed at the simplicity of my method of arriving at excellence, and charmed with the ease of attaining to heights quite inaccessible before. To show the wonderful grasp of my own unaided mindI I will now condense, into one sentence, everything in my system that is at all essential. The prime and   A Delibation on Style.     251 ultimate desideratum of him who aims at nothing below the mountain-peaks of excellence in style should be the shunning all common features. Thus, he should employ only unhacknied terms; avoid all idioms; and preserve, under every phase of subject- matter, a certain dignity, a quiet loftiness of tone, beyond the reach, or indeed comprehension, of medi- ocrity. Let the composition in hand be high-sound- - ing in terms, and majestic in its, general flow,--and whether you are likely to be understood or not, you may safely count on the admiration and respect of all your readers. Let me elucidate my system. I will suppose the case of an audience assembled to witness some per- formance at the Academy of Music-a delay-and an unexpected speech by a stranger. At the risk of offending you by associating, with excellence, a very uncomplimentary shadow, I will indulge myself in two reports of the affair; the first, a humble approach to the style I worship, and the other, a re-cast of the subject, in a commoner mould. Among other and more important advantages of my system, you will perceive that, by it, length may be secured-which writers will allow is no slight advantage.   FIRST REPORT. a AN immense, luctating throng was collocated.  All ages and conditions were there commingled; senile sires, and grandames long in drear senes- cence, alternated with unablac- tated infants and the interve- nient growths of humanity. For a period there was some- thing quite lethargic in the quiet; but ere long the deferring began tg commove the people, and ominated a general con- citation-the prognostic and final diagnostic of which was the now friequent allision of hands, opertaneous curses, and streporous, vague shouts with no apparent purpose.  The catacoustic results of this re- sounding prolusion were as- tounding; the reboation by the walls commingling and unsig- nificising the sounds, and dis- tracting as well as deafening the unfortunate being necessi- tated to be a listener. But at last the effect of this popular commotion was manifest. An orgillous, ponderous, englutted, oleaginous, atrabilarous indivi- dual with a cane, took his ope- rose way to the centre of the space before the curtain; upon which, a seeming prolocutor among the people ejaculated ' Order!' and caused the tumult to subside. The obese stranger possessed rather a plebeian than aristocratic look; and his ver-   SECOND REPORT. "A regular crowd was jam- med into the Academy. Old foozles, of both sexes, were there-so were squalling brats: In ten minutes from the time the affair was advertised to come off, 'the jolliest row could be confidently looked for. Yells, hoots, claps, stamps, and groans shook the walls, and stunned everybody. Just in time to save a regular cav- ing-in of the building, a fat, pompous-looking old chap, with a solemn air, a cane, and a dull red face, appeared before the curtain, and waddled to the centre of the stage,-where he stood awhile, puffing and sweating: dike a bud) not yet ready to 'blow.' For a mo- ment ns chances of being heard seemed rather slim; but all doubts were soon removed by   meil countenance was bathed in that aqueous effusion which usually results from heat and excitement. He at once began indesinently to pour out a cataclysm of incoherent elo- quence, abounding in exple- tives and periphrasis, and ex- hibiting, throughout, a perplex- ing semidiaphaneity of mean- ing. His utterance soon be- came inspissate; and his wan- derings, in body and mind, be- trayed his familiarity with loxodromics.  He seemed en- gagcd in a luctation with his emotions. Repeated indiscreet humectations of his whistle ] had   evidently  overpowered him. He had begun to hesitate I for words, an ill-directed pty- alism was suffusing his hirsute appendage, and he was aiding his meaning with frequent grimaces and  ceiliads (being E threatened with complete ob- mutescence)-when his per- formances became unbearable to the people, who now indulg- ed in the frequent ejaculation, E -'Exsiccate!-Exsiccate!' Hiss- es aided the dehortation. -A  humorous person in the throng denominated him   ' that rare 8 plant, the Anemone,' other- c wise, the Windflower. They threatened, if he remained, to f effect his forcible metathesis, and subject his fleece to inus- tion. One well-versed in phy- t siognomy would have discover- ed in his countenance at this sl   the mighty yell of ' Orderl from a pair of brazen lungs, which cry majestically shut down the noisy crowd at once. The fat Unknown commenced his remarks; but it soon be- came fully evident that he was drunk. Nobody could make head or tail of his speech, or give the remotest guess at what he was driving at. His voice grew thicker and thicker; he stumbled awfully, and gave other evidences of being well swizzled-such as making faces, and winking significantly, to aid his meaning. The crowd were soon disgusted. Cries of 'Dry up!-dry up I' became frequent, and hisses,- hoots, shrill noises of various kinds, effectually flabbergasted him. This effect was partly brought about by the apples, oranges, &c., that showered around him-one hit-   moment strong indications of intimidation and alarm; for the expressions of displeasure were now ecumenical. The defoe- dated atmosphere was resonant with the tumult. Projectiles were traversing the whole inte- rior-impinging freely against his person. He now digni- fiedly placed his zoophoric cane under his arm, salaamed with grace, and passed majestically from the field of vision. His stately avolation, conjoined with the simultaneous sibila- tion, afforded a diverting in- stance of the overwhelming power of the popular will. The ponderous quondam declaimer, being stricken in the sinister optic by a flying missile, pro- bably proceeded to negociate for a xerocollyrium." Is comment necessary?   ting him in the left peeper. So, concluding to tortle, he drew himself up, proud but disgust- ed, bowed sarcastically, and dignifiedly cut his lucky. No use trying to stem a crowd. The first thing the greasy vic- tim probably did, after leaving, was to buy a plaster for his bunged eye."   256        L'Envoi. full, your part in that friendly chat which I should take the care to set going. I am ready, now, to lay aside, as a thing to be disused, this comic mask, with its exaggerated grin, from behind which I have some- times peeped for a moment, to set you thinking by the apparition of a sober countenance. I would love to listen, with a pleased and serious attention, to all you would kindly say: for the voice of a friend is a pleasant music to me, and is never wearisome. But this may not be. Much against my will, I must alone sustain the burden of this last commu- nion, if there be one;-on me devolves the duty of reviewing our brief acquaintance, of expressing good wishes for the future, and bidding the final adieux. As we observe, in actual life, that they who are most affected by the nearness of a separation, are the least heartened to make a flourish with their protestations; so it will become mne to cultivate a brevity, in this place, and a manner chastened by subdued emotion,- and not to weary you with prolonged and insincere assurances, or shock- your nicer feelings by the display of an unnatural gaiety. "It is certain that good Humour do wonderfully heighten Beauty," is a cheerful sentiment found in   "Envoi.       . 257 Mr. PIPS his Diary. Beauty not less of mind, fair reader,- than person. How may we promote this "good Humour," so justly valued by Mr. PIPs? Why, in no better way than by the reading of cheer- ful books. If Mr. PEPPER and I have made a book of this kind,-if it should happen to have brightened some dull faces, or lightened for the moment a few heavy hearts--why, I cannot say I am sorry we allowed ourselves to write it. I might almost address: my associate in the language of the warm-hearted Mrs. GAMP, who, at the termination of some alter- nated funereal labor, exclaims to Mrs. HARRIS with cordiality: "I hope it won't be long afore we works together, off and on, again." On second thought, it would not be possible to make that classic language apply; since Mr. PEPPER will' hardly lend himself again to the schemes of a literary speculator. But there is nothing to prevent me from again skimming the cream off a most prodigious quantity of the "milk of human kindness," and blessing the world with the oleaginous result. Stupid me! where is my pet figure of the "Museum of Fancies?"You will remember I made a great flourish with it when I bowed you in. But every   258        L'Envoi. one, now and then, "misses his figure." So you have "seen everything," have you? And now, I suppose, you want your money back. "Don't you wish you may get it!"I see I wrong you: you were but regretting the smallness of the collection. I could easily have made it larger; but I thought it wise to err on the safer side. Perhaps, so far from being displeased, you have at times half allowed yourself to think it would be a fine recreation to "make such things" yourself.  Strangle those fancies, my friend, as fast as they are born. Even the frailest, of the fabrics you admire, were not made without labor: and the artiste had not always a grin on his face. Be thankful you have the heart to laugh at conceits which to him have long outlived their point, if they ever seemed to have one. You "must be going?"  Well, good-bye:-did I hurt you? Ah! it has been remarked my grasp is hearty. I see one may be too cordial. Let me wave my hand, and say: FAREWELL.
