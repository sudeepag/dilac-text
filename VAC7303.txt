Harness the big black mare in the top-buggy. Come, hurry now; don't be long. Why don't you hurry along? John, John! Come here. Go in there and help harness that mare; that sleepy, good-for-nothing scamp never will get it done." "O, dear! O, dear!" the old gentleman groaned aloud. "What shall I do?Henry failed -+and dead! Why did he commit suicide P I can't see. I thought he was safe above this crisis." "Come, come! Have you that mare harnessed?  Jim, here! Go and call William. I wonder where he is. O, well, here he comes. There, now, get in and take this despatch to the railroad. Then hurry right back and get ready, for we must start orthe noon train for Chi- cago, to attend Henry's funeral. He's to'be buried day after to-mor- row, I believe, at one o'clock; we can get there, I think, in time, if we are spry. Now, hurry: do you hear? Why don't you start? Here, hold on - stop a minute! Stop that crazy fellow in the buggy there. He don't know what he is about," said old Ki, as he came trotting along his gray hair flying, and his red shirt sleeves fluttering in the wind. "Where. are you going?" he asked, as he came up to the carriage, out of breath. "I'm going to the Junction with this despatch," answered William, a little chagrined at being thus unnecessarily detained. "Well, what are you going to do when you get there?" "I'm going to give this despatch to the telegraph operator, and have it sent to Chicago." "Well, that will do; go ahead. I didn't know but you had forgot- ten what you was going to do."  O;         LOVE ON THE WING. William went off muttering to himself about the whimsical foibles  of his father, of whom he had learned, from trying experience, the utter uselessness of opposing any wish. We will give a little history of old Ii, as he was familiarly called by  nearly every one. His given name was Hezekiah, and to abbreviate  it they called him Ki; and as he advanced in years it became Old Ki.     L He lived, though he was not born, near the village of Skaneateles, and was known far and near as a genial, hospitable old gentleman. He was born in 1790, and during a long and useful life he accumulat- ed a large property, his estates being valued at the time of his  death -which took place in 1863--at nearly a million of dollars.  He was far .the most wealthy man in the town, owning large tracts of valuable land in both Onondaga and Cayuga counties, together  with a large and modem improved distillery, flouring mill, and wool-  len factory. Some of these mills were situated on the outlet of the beautiful Skaneateles Lake. The distillery was situated about four miles down the stream, and called the Hart Lot, -the land for- merly belonging to a person named Hart. This place he built up him- self, and it has never passed since its first purchase, out of the family's hands. His son-in-law owned it for a few years, he having met with some little financial embarrassments; but he soon after regained it, after having paid all his debts, dollar for dollar. He was a nervous, headstrong man, large and portly, weighing in his prime three hundred and twenty pounds. He was impatient of re- straint, and could brook no opposition. He was always kind and gentle to his wife, whom he dearly loved, but rough and boisterous to every- body else. Often he could be heard, at three o'clock in the morning, yelling at the top of his voice to his men to get up, and not sleep there all day. His business was varied and complicated, raising stock as well as farming, and feeding them slop from the still during the cold win. ter months; and for this particular job he routed Michael, the slop- drawer, earlier than the rest. If he didn't have a load of slop at the old farm - this farm was about two miles from the still, and three from the old homestead--by six o'clock in the morning, he was sure to get i a blowing, as old Ki termed it. These lblowings used to come when least expected, and sometimes without any provocation; for it not unu- sually happened that for a mistake, a blunder, or an accident, everybody around the place - except the one who was to blame - received a blow- , ing in some shape or other. At such times he would blow for some imaginary offence, if he couldn't find any real ones. Sometimes he   OLD KI.              7  would blow a man in the presence and hearing of another, whom he     i wished to take the hint, and conduct himself accordingly. He had four children; two boys, Isaac and William, and two girls, all of whom play important parts in this story. The daughter's hus-  band, of whom we spoke at the commencement as having failed, and  then committed suicide by throwing himself into the Lake at Chicago,  was formerly very wealthy; and even up to a short time before his sad  and untimely end, was reputed worth two millions of dollars. But he became involved in some heavy grain speculations with a reckless part- ner, who bought at higher figures than the circumstances warranted;.  and grain coming down immediately, together with some losses on the  lakes, swamped the whole holse. His name was Henry Bentley. He  owned several city lots in the heart of the city, all of which were sold.  by the sheriff. One, however, being in chancery, could not be at that  time disposed of, and consequently was allowed to remain until the de- cision of the court was heard.  Henry had three children, two daughters and one son. The oldest girl, Flora, was ten years old at the time of her father's death, and  Helen was seven. The boy Charles was three years old.  "Well, William, have you got back? It seems' to me you have      ' been a very long time. I suppose you had to stop and talk with some  of the rowdies down there." "No, sir; I delivered the message, and saw Mr. Murphy send it off, and it's there before now, in Mary's hands." "I gad, now, that's more than you know. But come in, and let's get ready as soon as possible. Here, Mike, tie this mare at the barn door. Do you hear!" yelled the old man in a rage.  "Yes sir; an' faith I'm comin' as fast as me legs can carry me."   A "Well, that's right; but don't stand thumbing your buttons when I want anything done."  "An' sure didn't I start as soon as yer hollered?"          , "I don't know. But you go over to Isaac's as quick as ever you did anything in your-lit-nd tell the folks there, if they are going to the  funeral they had better be getting ready as fast as possible, for it is  now ten o'clock, and the train starts at twelve. Do you hear? Why don't you start? What are you standing there for?"P "Faith, an' -I was listening to what yer had to say." ,  "Well, go ahead, and clipper over there, and get back, for I want to tell you what I want you to do while I am gone." "Yes, sir," and Mike was out of sight in a minute, glad to get away from him even for so short a time as that.    8         LOVE ON THE WING. The old gentleman went into the house, where he found Maria, his wife, sobbing bitterly over the great and irreparable loss her daughter had sustained. At the sight of those tears the old gentleman's firm- ness gave way, and he wept like a little child. Great tears rolled down his cheeks, and he groanedin the anguish of his spirit. "O," said he, "what will my poor daughter and her three little children do? left alone and penniless. Ha, me! this is too bad. But we will have to bring them down here, and find a home for them somewhere." "Well, come, pa, are you not going Why don't you get ready P Ma is already and waiting," said William, as he came down, all equipped and rigged for the journey. "O, yes; I forgot that I was not ready. Go out and see if that boy has returned, and if he has, tell him to hitch the black team on to the Cobb Democrat. There are no trunks to take. See if Isaac's folks are  almost ready."  "Come, come, Maria; I wouldn't sit there crying all day. I can't find anything. I wonder where my shirt is, and collar. Call Bridget, won't you, and tell her I want my shirt and collar. There, now, my boots. Where's that boy?"He went to the door, with his face all lather, and called for William. "Has that brat come back yet? If he has, send him here to black my boots."  "Yes, sir, he is hitching up the team; he will be there in a minute." "O, dear me! I wonder if he hasn't that team hitched up yet. I can move round as quick as that myself. It seems to me as if vou were slower to day than you ever was before. I don't believe you would stir any faster if the whole family were dead." "Well, say, if you are going to that funeral on the noon train, you had better get that lather off your face." "Well, now, you just mind your own business, and get that team round here; I'll warrant I'll be ready as soon as the rest of you. Send that boy here now, to black my boots. Where is John? Tell him to take that mare off, and put her in the stable, and -" "Well, say, it's a quarter of eleven now, and you haven't much time  to spare if you start right away." The old gentleman hurried in, and soon got himself in readiness; for  his thoughtful wife had brought all his clothes out, and they were hang- ing on the backs of chairs when he came in.  "Say, Maria, if you are all ready, suppose you step out and tell Wil- liam to drive over and get Isaac's folks." She looked out, and saw him driving off on a brisk trot, in the direc- tion of Isaac's house. i1E T   SETTING OUT.            9g     ' She told him he had gone. "Gone! Well, he's a smart fellow. I gad, now! .why didn't you hol- ii ler to him, and stop him, for I wanted to send word over there. But never mind; he's out of sight and hearing now. I never can have  anything done right, unless I do it myself; for every one seems to be crazy when any such thing happens."                i; "I can't see, for my part," says she, " any one as crazy as yourself. I don't believe you know whether you are a-foot or a horseback, for you start and jump at every little thing, as if you was half frightened to X death."                              -  I gad, now, they have come already. Well, go out and tell them to lX stay right in the wagon, and get in yourself. I'll be out shortly; I must go out and tell John what to do."  He went around to the horse-barn, and told John to "take Boney1 and old Sorrel, and hitch them before the oxen, and plough that tobacco  ground. Mr. English will hold the plough, and do you back up and take out every stone. Plough it good, if you don't plough more than a acre a day. I want you to drive. Drive slow. Tell English if he don't  plough it good, I will have Tom Peak at it. He can plough good. I'll' have Mike, and Jim, and Pat spread manure, and tell them to spread it fine; and if there is any coarse straw that don't cover up very good, Bill and John can come out and put it in the furrow. Now you hear, don't you?"   "Yes, sir. But say, I suppose we'll take that big number five plough. I can't find the clevis that belongs to it." "Well, go to the shop and have one made then. Now, don't bother me any more; " and off he started for the wagon.  After a short but quick drive, they arrived at the Junction just as  the train was coming in. Mike wheeled around the team, and the party alighted a short distance from the train. William always es- corted his mother; and if there were any younger ladies present, with-  out escorts, they had to wait till William had first taken care of his  mother. He rode by her side, and would allow no one else to wait on her. In this party there were five, namely, the old gentleman and his,  wife, Isaac and his wife, and William. They found a car at last, in which they could all sit together. Palace cars were not in vogue then; and if they had been, they would not run  them on this road, for it is not direct. Nothing occurred during the  trip to mar its pleasure, but it was nevertheless a sad one; they were going to escort the bereaved widow and the remains of a beloved hus- band home. Whenever the children were mentioned, tears glistened  Wi   10        LOVE ON THE WING. in the eyes of all. Even the stern old grandpa wept -he wept bitter tears for the children; for he didn't know how they would fare when he was gone, with no one to look after them, or care for them, but uncles.  They arrived in due time at Chicago, where they found the weeping widow and children mourning over the unfortunate dead. They found everything they had heard was too true; and all was sold, with hardly enough left to pay the funeral expenses; even to the household furni- ture; all had been grasped by the greedy creditors, and then there was not enough to satisfy their avariciousness. They could take no more. It is a pitiable sight to see a family bereaved, but it is more sad to see them robbed and plundered of their all. To see little children cast off without a home, and alone in the world -'t is enough to melt the hard- est heart or the most obdurate misanthrope to compassion. Children feel the pang the most bitterly, especially when a loved father is stricken down in the hour of his usefulness, in the prime of his glory. One has to be little, and suffer such a loss, to feel accurately the sorrow of such bitter grief. It was indeed sad to see with what filial tederness those two orphaned girls tarried by the cold remainsof their father, and how loath they were to leave their home when they came to take the coffin to the hearse. The sound of the wheels in the gravelled roads, and the sound of the tolling bell, made them more sad. The day was chilly, and a slow drizzling rain fell to drape the cold scene in a watery pall. Slowly the long procession moved on ;-and as the children cast a lingering look behind at the loved home of, their youth, where all their happy days had been spent, and where, except the present mournful event, not one cloud of sorrow had ever dimmed for a mo- ment the sunlight of their happiness, they burst out in a loud par- oxysm of grief, and cried, "O, mamma! mamma! don't take us away forever. Let us come back again; won't you, mamma? Let us come back and play again around the fountain, where we have so often listened to the splashing water, and watched the little fishes dart td and fro. O, dear mamma! this is too bad." "Don't, my dear children, feel so bad. We will soon find another home as pleasant as the one we are leaving. Grandpa has ajfountain, with little fishes sporting in the basin; and in a little while you will leain to love them, as dearly as those we are leaving behind." They soon arrived at the depot, and the coffin was conveyed from the hearse to the car; then the mourners entered a car, and were soon on their way home.    ARRIVAL HOME. -THE BURIAL.         11  ARRIVAL   H[OME. -- THE BURIAL.,     " ' i, CHAPTER II. ARRIVAL HOME.--THE BURIAL.                l A  HEARSE and carriages were in waiting at the Junction to convey i the mourning party home, where, tired and sorrowful, they sought l that rest they so much needed. The funeral took place on the morrow, from the home of the widow's father; and, after a short and eloquent -  address from the Episcopal minister, from the text, "If a man die,  shall he live again?" the remains were conveyed to their last and   ' final resting-place. Thus was this long and sorrowful affair brought to  a close, but the memory of it never faded from the recollection of those orphaned children. The monotonous sound of everything added to the  solemnity of the mourning scene. All spoke in whispering tones, and with sad, sorrowful countenances. The old gentleman, however, looked upon such scenes as a necessary  consequence, and, after the first day's grief, he did not allow a single  tear to flow. He was more philosophically resigned to the decrees of fate, because he knew that such things would happen some time, though  in this case it was untimely, and deeply to be regretted; but no mourn-  ing could bring back the departed, nor change his condition; therefore, after the usual ceremonies over the dead, he never allowed the subject  to trouble his mind; but he always felt it an imperative duty to pay  this last testimonial of respect to the departed dead, no matter how  . friendly or inimical the person was. If he was a neighbor or an ac- i quaintance, he always attended the funeral if it was possible. The bereaved family found a warm and genial home beneath the old  gentleman's roof. He tried to obliterate, in the minds of the children, ,  all remembrance of their sad bereavement, by his kind, social, and  genial manners towards them; and he succeeded, to a certain extent, ! by telling them to feel that they were perfectly at home. He would be their father and their friend.  But there was one who did not relish this large addition to the fam- 1 ily; and that was Bridget, the Irish nurse, who tended the old gentle-  man. The old gentleman had been troubled with a cancer for the last  fifteen or twenty years, and latterly it began to assume a more malignant i  form; consequently he had to keep doctoring it all the time. He had  tried everything far pnl piear, but had found no relief - no cessation of , i   12         LOVE ON THE WING. the acute, darting pain in his face. le paced the floor of his room many and many a long night, being wholly unable to catch a moment's sleep. He thought that his turn!would come next to go to that bourn fro;n whence no traveller e'er returned; and many a night he brooded long on the destiny of man. But he always gave it up with an impa- tient sigh, and thought how utterly useless it was to attempt to fathom the jeep and boundless unknown. He could think and preach on the subject as wisely as any one, for his mind was as well prepared to guess of these things as any one. The possibilities of a revealed religion never for a moment shed a ray of joy into his darkened soul, neither did he have the patience to read nor to listen to any one on the sub- ject. No one could know anything of it, and everything that was written or said was all guess work from beginning to end. He gladly gave to the churches, and to every charitable cause; but to believe in anything but tangible things was not in his nature. Our business was with earthly things, because we were of the earth; if there was ever anything beyond, we would have been endued with natures prepared to grapple with essences of a finer character, and to comprehend them. But now, while on earth, it was our duty to devote our attention to things which partook of earth. Thus the old gentleman reasoned; and, whether right or wrong, he has, ere now, discovered. He died in the faith in which he had always lived, maintaining to the last, that if there was merit in good works, he was safe; for his charity was his glory: and this, every one will con- fess, went far towards redeeming his other irreligious tendencies. He was not what the world calls a Christian, neither was he what the world calls a wicked man. His god was money, but his cause was justice. He never wronged any one, but was a friend to the poor, and a father to the fatherless. If any one was in trouble, he relieved them; if any wrong was being done, he reprimanded the agent with a tongue- slashing; and if the wrong-doer persisted, he was collared by himself, or the law. Late years, old Ki had been raising a good deal of tobacco, and he tried hard to find competent men to undertake the management of it. He raised none himself, it being let out on shares to those whom he could trust. He found that quality as well as quantity was a desider-  atum very much required; consequently a Connecticut tobacco-grower  coming along, was engaged, but failing to give entire satisfaction,  was, after the first year, allowed to return and raise tobacco in a more favorable clime. But the next year, 1860, the commencement of our story, a young man came along, professing to understand the busi-   A NEW  OVERSEER.          13 ness; but old Ki, a little incredulous from past experience, was loath  to engage him on account of his youth. He put him off, with a request  that he call again in a day or two, and he would see what could be done  for him. Old Ki wished a day or two for the purpose of making a few inquiries concerning the qualities of this young man for the job he had solicited. After a few of which, where he was well known, and learn- ing nothing unfavorable, he was prepared to give him a definite answer, on the next occasion of his visit. . He came on Saturday, as per agreement, and found old Ki out on the piazza, giving some lessons to the men in rather a loud voice. This rather startled the young man at first, who, being unacquainted as to the old man's eccentricities, was not prepared for such a storm; but, as soon as the old man saw some one was coming, he lowered his tones, and by the time Richard, reached the piazza, he was talking quite pleasantly; and he greeted our hero with a quiet "Good morning." "Good morning, Mr. Wood; this is a pleasant April morning." "Well, yes -hem - I gad, now, I heard that Mr. M-- said you didn't like to get up very well in the morning." "Ha, indeed! I'm of the opinion you have been rightly informed,  for I have yet to see the one who does like this early rising."  "Well, come in, and we will talk the matter over. Here, take this chair, you may break that little sofa thing."              - "Why, what a pleasant fireplace you have. I had feared that these old fireplaces had become entirely extinct, because of the alarming decrease of wood." "Wall, sir, I don't know. I have one yet, and mean to keep it as long as I have any wood. But say, Mr., -your name is Lovell, I be- lieve, - yes." As the young man bowed affirmatively. "Wall, then, Mr. Lovell, I would like to get some one to raise to- bacco; but we don't any of us intend going to school, and if you want to teach school, there is the place over on the corner;" and he pointed I in the direction of a school-house.                  I "Well, sir, I thought I was going to raise tobacco," said the young man, as he looked inquiringly into the old man's face, a little astonished  at his queer way. "Yes, that was what I wanted you for," answered the old gentleman,; smiling gently at the evident embarrassment of the young man. "But I hear you are just out of the Academy at Elbridge, and have not yet; forgotten the books you have been poring over all your life. I mean  that here was no place for students." 2    "        LOVE ON THE WING.                i "You don't object to my reading a little evenings, and Sundays, after  church, do you?"  "O, no, certainly not; but I don't want any one to take books into  the field, or hide them under the fence, or in the barn."  ", well, you have nothing to fear of that nature from me. If I raise  tobacco, I will raise it; and you won't care what I do with my leisure moments, so long as your interests are not impaired." " no; we will get along well enough, I guess. I was only indul-  ging in a little sarcasm, you know. You mustn't pay any attention to   1 what I say, - that is, you mustn't lay anything up. I like to hear my- self talk once in a while, but nothing offensive is intended."      . "O, my dear sir, I never lay anything u, though I try to avenge my grievances as I go along in the same spirit in which they are given to me. I guess we will have no trouble." The agreement was soon after concluded, and the young man went home, to prepare to resume his duties at Mr. Wood's as soon as the weather would permit. It was in early April he had agreed to, come, to assist in preparing the ground for the reception of the plants. Plough- ing the tobacco-ground was usually the first job of the spring, as it was  best ploughed twice, and the longer it'could lie before the last time  ploughing the better. Consequently, he came on the following week, made his beds, and sowed the seed, and he was ready for the ploughing, which was to commence on the morrow. The manure was first to be spread, and then, if it lay pretty thick, it was necessary to go along and place it in the furrow. As it will be some time before the plough gets up to where Richard's patch commences, we will see with how much interest old Ki watches him. He had been spreading two or three days on a five-acre lot, and not  half of it was yet finished, and two teams were all that time drawing in between, where the spread manure did not meet. The plough was fast approaching that portion of the field where Richard was at work,  when it would be 'necessary for him to. have it finished, so as to take  the plough, while the teams which were drawing manure were wanted immediately to draw some on other portions of the lot. Old Ki had  allowed the teams one day longer than he intended they should have,  in which he hoped they would finish the drawing; but upon asking one  of the teamsters how much longer it would take him to finish, was answered,-  "Faith, an' I think the way the young lad is goin' on it'll take at  least a couple of days yet to give him enough on it. He's a terrible fuller for wantin' to get enough of the manure. Don't you believe the.  .                       .   FAULT-FINDING.            15 lad went over the line, an' threw a whole row of heaps over on to his land!"  "I gad, now," he replied, "I'll see about that. You go ahead, and draw some over on Mr. D --'s. Here, Mike, come and harness the black mare, and hitch her on the wagon. Why don't you step along ? You walk as if you were a hundred years old. Come, hurry up." The boy ran, as directed, to the stable, while he hurriedly led the mare from the stall, and was about putting the harness on, when old Ki came trotting out in great haste, and inquired,- "Haven't you that horse on yet? you little, lousy brat! I gad, I'll get some one who can harness a horse in less than half a day." "How long have I been ? " tremblingly asked the boy, as he hastily buckled the straps. "How long have you been? Why, long enough to harness four horses. I gad, they'll have the lot all ploughed before I get there." "Why don't you start a-foot? You can get there afore any one can harness a horse." "Yes, then you wouldn't have anything to do. You're always plan- ning to get rid of work. There, now, give me the lines, and you go and pick over them potatoes. Don't get any rotten ones in; now mind, and look sharp," said he, as he drove rapidly out of the yard, and down the road. It was a sign of an approaching storm to see him driving like a fury towards the lot, and the Irishmen had learned that it mollified his wrath very much if he saw them moving about briskly, and attending diligently to their labors; consequently, whenever they saw him coming, they quickened their motions about one half, no one knowing on whom the fury of the hurricane would be spent. But Richard was a compar- ative stranger to them and to him, and had not yet learned any of the stratagems of the former nor of the foibles of the latter. He saw him coming, but did not know the cause of his apparent anxiety, neither did he question himself, for it might be his natural gait; but as soon as he rode up, he saw that he was angry, and that he was the head of the offending; for as soon as he came within hearing distance he began,- " I gad, now, - hem - a-hem, - do you suppose that I'm going to keep them teams drawing manure for you all summer ? I gad, I'll see; I'll see about this. I thought you knew how to raise tobacco; I thought you knew how to spread manure. I'll have some one here who can spread this as it ought to be; Why don't you scatter it all over there ? What are you leaving that wide strip up through there for ? " " Why," said Richard, looking up in astonishment, "I'm going to have some more drawn in there."   16         LOVE ON THE WING. "No, you ain't. There ain't going to be any more drawn on here. If you can't spread that all over, I'll get some one who can. I have something else for my teams to do besides drawing manure all the while." "Well, I declare!"Richard replied, as a look of disappointment settled upon his face, "I had hoped that I surely would get enough manure here where there is so much, and such ample facilities for get- ting it." "Yes, and I hoped, when I engaged you, I'd have some one who knew how to raise tobacco," he answered, his anger sensibly abating, caused by the covert flattery in Richard's friendly reply. "But, say, can't they draw in some more here? then I'll try to 'get along with the rest," Richard inquired, as he turned to go away. "Yes, they may draw some more in there; but that's all I'll have drawn into this lot." Then he turned, and drove at a reckless rate to- wards where others were engaged in the same business. It is needless to say the teams kept on drawing on that ground two or three days longer, he having apparently forgotten all about his conversation; or else he meant they should keep on till the lad had enough, without anything more being said about it. That was one of his ways. He would sometimes swear by all the saints that not another load should be drawn, when by one little word he would instantly. change his mind, and not only grant what was before desired, but even twice as much. He wanted a little coaxing, and Richard happened, though accidentally, to hit the nail right on the head. He was much surprised to see the teams keep drawing, day after day, when he expected every moment to see them drawn off; for he had made no calculations to have so much drawn on, and had spread it all over the ground, though in some places it was rather thin. CHAPTER III. TAKE SCENE AND MUSIC. O  LD Ki loved the little orphans as dearly as if they were his own children, and he often held them on his knees and listened to their childish prattle. Flora used to read to him the daily papers, after the morning's duties had been dispensed with. They attended the dis- trict, school on the corner, a short distance from home, and every even-    "AKE SCENE AND MUSIC.           17      ii '7 ing they followed him from place to place until he seated himself on the veranda, and was prepared to listen to their grievances or their joys. And on this occasion Flora had some complaints to make re-i garding the ill treatment she had received from Bridget, and the abu- sive and wicked language she had used. "O, well, Flory, never mind; I will see you are not hurt. If she says anything more to you, come and tell me. My little children shall not be abused here." "Why, grandpa, you said just so before, and she was just as bad and wicked to me the next day. She killed that little chicken I brought in from the barn, and she said she wouldn't have anything of the kind around the house; and, don't you believe, she called me a little naughty brat. . I ain't naughty, am I, grandpa?" "Why, no ; I always thought you was a good little girl. I'll see that she lets you alone after this.' "O, grandpa!" chimed in little Helen, "when are you going to let us have a sail on the lake It looks so nice to be out there on the    ' bright waters; and, hark! there's the music. O, isn't it nice! I wish I was out there how. May I go, grandpa?" she asked, in girlish glee, as she ran up to where he was sitting, and pleadingly looked up into his face. "Why, you crazy girl! what would you do out there on the lake alone? You can hear the music here just as well, and can look out over there  and enjoy it all in fancy, without running any danger of being drowned. Some time, though, we will have a sail, when the water is smooth, and there is no danger of upsetting. But we will all go together, when we go, and have some one experienced to manage the boat." This conversation took place late in the month of May, as the trio sat on the veranda, which looked out on the broad and beautiful Skane- ateles Lake, while the band were out for the first time this spring, breathing the rich' melody of their souls on the still, quiet scene. It was a scene of surpassing loveliness, with the silvery moon sending aslant her beams of light upon the lake, and reflecting from shore to shore the dim outline of trees and houses, hills and plains. All was lit up with a gorgeous beauty of light and splendor. Beautiful and richly cultivated fields ran down to the very edge of thei water; and then again, huge forests extended down, dipping their' branches into the clear water. To ride through this wild forest of pines i and hemlocks, in a still, calm, moonlight evening, was a rich and glori- ous treat. It was weird and romantic in the extreme, and it carried one's mind back to his youthful days, when he used to delight in aquatic sports. 2                             :  ! ;   18         LOVE ON THE WING. It was such nights as this that the band -the glory of Skane-  ateles-used to love to get out, and send its greetings of love in harmony's sweetest strains far up the silvery lake; and into every nook and hill-side rivulet these glorious notes penetrated, cheering the weary laborer, as homeward he returned from his toil, reviving the hopes of the bereaved, and sending a thrill of joy and gladness into the heart of everyone. It was not strange that Helen's heart thrilled with rapture as she looked upon this lovely scene, contemplating the many objects of interest which everywhere met her eye. She stood entranced in all her girlish beauty, drinking in the strains of harmony as they came warbling across the smooth and tranquil lake. Her soul was filled with delightful emotions; not even the memory of her departed father, and the loved home of her youth, could for a moment darken her brows; but there were times when these recollections lay like a heavy pall upon her spirits, and it required the utmost exertion for her to shake herself from the desponding gloom which seemed to have settled around her. Her grandpa was much pleased to see that for once  the sorrow was lifted from her bleeding heart, which had for two  months been longing for the loved voice and pleasant smile of her father.  Flora was older, yet she was not resigned, for she was of that calm, morose temperament, which silently brooded over her suf- ferings, and said nothing, while Helen was quick dad impulsive. When she was happy, all was joy and sunshine around her; but when she wept, a deep, dark gloom settled not only upon her, but also upon every one with whom she came in contact. You saw it in the dark brow, and heard it in the trembling voice, and she impressed every one with the same monotonous sorrow. Flora sought out a quiet corner, and' there mourned; not a tear rolled down her motionless cheeks, nor hardly a sigh escaped from her tightly-compressed lips, while her  heart was slowly but surely breaking. If she could have wept, the pent-up grief would have flowed out in tears and sobs; but it was not to be; and this silent grief was telling fearfully upon her health, and un- less something could be done to divert her thoughts from the sorrow which was gnawing like a canker into her very life, she too would soon be where sorrow never comes, Her grandpa saw this, and he had been humoring every whim, in the hope that it would soon pass away. He had promised to give her a little pony to ride if she would cheer up some, and not be so despondent. "Don't you know, Flora, that I promised to give you a pony if you would cheer up, and laugh, and let a little sunshine into-your grieved heart?" he asked, as she sat on his knee, and he stroked the golden curls which fell in such rich profusion on her shoulders. l   FLORA'S SORROW.            19 "Yes," she replied, "I remember; but it hurts me so right here to   i think of forgetting papa;" and she laid her hand on her heart, which  throbbed and beat so loud that it could be heard.            i "Why can't you laugh, and jump up and down, the same as Helen  does? Listen! Don't you hear that music? What is it? Ain't that  1: Yankee Doodle they are playing now? cYou don't hear anything sad in  that, do you?"j 'No, grandpa; but my heart is all shrouded over with gloom, and it hurts so much to think I am happy, when I ain't," she said, in a pitying voice.        ,                     i "Well, if you don't cheer up, I'll have to give Helen the pony; then you will feel worse, won't you?" he asked, looking down into her sad  face. "No, grandpa, it won't make me feel any worse, for not one particle of grief can be added to the sorrow I now feel, and make it more pain- ful; no more bitter draught can be presented to me, for I have lost my father, and all that would have made life pleasant and worth living for. Now, what have I? Nothing but my hands, and depending upon the  charity of relatives for a home." "Why, my dear child, how can you talk so?" he asked, while tears were streaming down his face. "Don't you know that I promised to be your father, and to provide for your wants? You shan't be left destitute. I've enough here for all, and you shall have some." "O, do not, I beg of you, do that," she requested, while a deep moan I' escaped her. "Don't take what rightfully belongs to others and give  to me," she implored, with upturned face and beseeching eyes., "What I have here is my own, and I can give it to whom I wish.     i It don't rightfully belong to any one but me, and I am going to dispose of it as I think best."  "Well, you can do as you like, so can I; but I'll tell you before you  commence, I'll never touch one cent that ever comes otherwise than by my own industry. On that I am resolved. All I wish now is to get an  education, so I can teach school, and thus provide for my own neces-  sities. If ) ou will permit me to stay here till then, I shall be gratefully thankful, and always remember your kindness and generosity so long as I live."                                "You are a headstrong, wilful girl, and your excessive pride will be, the ruin of you. So you ain't going to marry, nor accept of any one's assistance? I guess you'll get sick of that notion after a while. Such talk as that will do for some story, but it won't play very pleasantly when you come to practise it. If you are really in earnest, I'll give i' i r Jo i    20         LOVE ON THE WING. you the best education there is to be had; both in music and drawing you shall have every advantage. So you can apply yourself just as diligently as you please, for you have a long course to run, as an edu- cation, such as you desire, is not to be obtained in one week, nor in one year; but in ten or a dozen."  "Thank you, grandpa; that will be all I desire," she replied, as a smile lit up her face. "What is that grandpa is going to give you, Flora?" asked Helen, as she came tripping gaily up, her face radiant with smiles; "an edu- cation, eh! O, well, if that's all, I don't care. I thought I heard some- thing about a pony. Are you going to give Flora a pony, grandpa, and not give me one?" she inquired, and with a look of impatience awaited an answer. "Yes. I'm going to give you both one, and a saddle, when you get a little older - not now; no, don't ask me; for I can't do it now." He purposely hurried to forestall Helen, who was about to plead that he wouldn't wait very long. "Why, grandpa, you don't know how well I can ride now! I used to ride papa's horse round the yard when he left him there to eat the green grass, and witho an wt t any one holding me on," she said, lowering her tone, as the memory of home and the loved ones flashed upon her mind. Her face darkened as she discovered a look of denial on the stern, hard features of her grandpa, and bursting into tears, found that relief which her sister had sought and could not find. "O, don't cry about that; you will get a horse one of these days," he said, patting her bowed head, and then twining the dark, wavy ring. lets around his fingers. "You are young, and you ought not to think that you can manage a horse yet. When you are twelve years old, you shall have a horse. I wish Flora wanted a horse half as bad; it would drive that cloud from her face, and let the light of day into her soul." "Yes, you would give her a horse in a moment, because she has golden curls, and mine are black. How I do hate blaak hair. I wish mine was like Flora's, then I could have a horse to ride." "It is not the color of your hair that I look at, but it is the number of your years, and the size of your little hands, that restrains me from gratifying your desire." Helen looked up, pouting, and said, "I guess I can wait. You -are going to let me take music lessons, ain't you, grandpa?" "Certainly; you shall have all the advantages that Flora has, and we will see who will make the best use of them, you or Flora."   FLORA AND HELEN COMPARED.           21  "O, Flora will, of course, for you always thought the most of her,  and you'will think she is the smartest, whether she is or not; but I'll show you I can beat her all hollow, if she is the oldest, and already has a start," she replied, as she straightened up and tossed her pretty curls scornfully back, and in a self-satisfied air strolled off, humming her favorite tune. "Helen is a good girl," he soliloquized, as he watched her receding, sylph-like form, as she disappeared among the shrubbery of the lawn. Her disposition is light and buoyant; her temperament impetuous and imperious. -From inferiors she could brook no restraint nor opposi- tion; but towards her parents obedience had been inculcated as a les- son, and enforced as a duty. She had been brought up under the disciplinary eyes of rigid and exacting parents, and she never for a moment rebelled against the unyielding behests of a doting father, and a kind, indulgent mother. Her complexion was dark - of an olive hue, with jet black, thick, and waving hair, which fell in massive curls upon her shoulders.     . Her hair was her glory,. and of it she was very proud. Her eyes were  black, and cunning, and full of mischief. Her nose was small and,  straight; her lips were beautifully curved, with small, round face.  Inform, and feature, and beauty, and queen-like loveliness, she was a second Cleopatra. The arts of the flirt were to her unknown, neither  did she ever after acquire them.           , Her sister Flora was directly her opposite, both in temperament and disposition. Her complexion was light, and her features regular. She   :  was small and delicate. She was modest and retiring, brave and reti- cent. She was a damper on Helen's daring impetuosity, while Helen  was always trying to infuse more life and activity into her sluggish mo- tions. Her step was slow and measured, and she seemed to be engaged in trying to solve some difficult mathematical problem, she was so en-  grossed upon some deep study. Her hair was of a light golden color,   , and fell in beautiful massive ringlets, upon a neck of almost transpa- rent whiteness, while her cheeks retained the ruddy flush of youth.  Her eyes were blue, over which arched a beautiful and expansive brow. Her eyelashes were long, and when she slept, lay upon her cheek. In    sleep, she was a perfect picture of repose and loveliness. Angels more fair and transcendently lovely never winged their aerial flight through the celestial spheres; for features more beautiful, a bearing  more stately and dignified, a motion more graceful, cannot possibly;  be pictured to the imagination. If she had a little of Helen's spright- liness, and impetuosity, and wilful temper, she would be as near per-  i i   22         LOVE ON THE WING. fection as it is possible to attain on this transitory sphere; but these jewels of temper and dispositions are placed in their casket by an irre- sponsible hand, and it is for us to use as our circumstances require, or more properly speaking, as we are permitted; and not to appropriate for our own selfish gratification, nor ask why was not this quality put in, nor why was that imperious quality substituted for one of a more amiable stamp. We find these treasures just as God gave them to us, andiwe cannot alter, without defacing the beautiful sym- metry of the whole. True we may cultivate and enlarge them, for the germ is there; if not, there could be no cultivation. Such are the- dispositions, and temper, and beautf of these two or- phaned girls, now justhlooming into womanhood, and thus early thrown upon the care of relatives and strangers, and from whose bountiful and generous hand one was willing to accept, while the other would receive nothing other than a cultivated and an accomplished mind. Thus these frail barks are cast upon the rough and tempestuous sea of life, each hoping to be able to fulfil her destiny, yet neither knowing nor guessing what vicissitudes and sorrows, mingled with a very little joy, they will have to undergo before they attain the glorious end. Even now, to one all is sunshine and joy, while the other is gloomy and sad. One thinks no clouds will ever darken the glorious sunshine of her life, while the other fears no sunshine will ever light her path- way through the world. One rejoices in the loving kindness, and en- during mercy of God; while the other doubts, and looks with no trust- ing confidence to the promising, yet darkened future. CHAPTER IV. RICHARD'S HOME AND HMSELF DESCRIBED.  ) ICHARD lived but a short distance from old Ki's farm, and the JI  walk to and from his labors was more pleasant than tiresome to him, as the road led along the bank of the lake, winding down into ra- vines, where a brooklet murmured down to the lake, then up a gentle hill, either side adorned by huge elms or stately oaks. It was about one mile from the luxurious home of the irascible old man. Richard's mother still lived, and discharged the duties of the house, which had so long de- volved exclusively upon her. It was the home of Richard's youth, and   RICHARD'S HOME AND HMSELF DESCRIBED.         23       where he had always lived, and which he hoped, never to leave until   .' removed by an unseen, yet not unwelcomed hand.  It was a romantic spot, and named by himself Cottage Grove. The house was unpretentious; small in its proportions, yet neat and attrac- 1;. tive in appearance. It was one story and a half high, with one room   . l in front, a parlor and bedroom; a kitchen, pantry, and bedroom back. A wing ran- out, and was occupied as a kind of wood-house, in one portion of which a cook-stoye stood, which was used in summer, and  where the washing and ironing were done during the warm weather.    : Two cosy bedrooms were finished off up stairs. A garden, of an acre  in extent, surrounded the house, or rather lay mostly behind the house. A small cow-shed and hog-pen were situated a little back from the    i house.  In front of the house, a small yard was devoted to flowers and; shrubbery - as indispensable to the neatness and good taste of the oc-  , cupants as the house itself. It was here Richard's father had lived, and here he died, leaving the place, together with some funds, in the hands of his wife and only son. The property had increased in value, and the money in bank had not diminished, but rather more had been ,  ^' continually added. Richard was fifteen years old when his father died, i and his mother managed, by washing and nursing the sick, to keep Richard at school winters, while during the summer he worked for neighboring farmers. Thus were soul and body kept together for six   i years prior to his introduction to my readers as a tobacco-raiser for old  Ki; his ag'ibeing, consequently, at this time, twenty-one years. Such was the home of Richard Lovell.  He was temperate in his habits and frugal in his diet, and rather re-' served in his manners. His disposition was morose and melancholy,  rarely mingling in society, and then taciturn -and retiring. He was a votary of nature, and his life was a constant study. He studied nature,  md people, and things. His library was filled with the choicest vol-  t i umes, the collection of his father and of himself. History, phi-    [i losophy, and science were installed upon the shelves of his memory, and .'  ;he spot where his father had delighted so much to dwell was pecu- iarly adapted to a contemplative mind. The beautiful lake, with its borders fringed with golden grain, or green with the verdant pasture,  : ippn which the herds of cattle and sheep of the thrifty farmers de-  I, lighted so much to gambol; and ever and anon the scattering trees  lipped their branches down into the pellucid waters, as if drinking up the moisture their roots vainly essayed to find. It was often that Richard found himself sitting in his library and parlor, which over-  ,.    24         LOVE ON THE WING. looked the beautiful expanse, as it seemed, of burnished silver, thinking over the past, the present, and the future. le loved thus to commune with his God. It seemed to bring him home to his ideal - the beau- tifuleanTd e good. As Richard had taken upon himself additional responsibilities, he thought he would, after some little trial, engage the services of a tried and faithful friend, - his schoolmate in former years, who since had been shifting around for himself, -to assist him in the duties he had undertaken to discharge. This was James Stoneman, well known in and around Skaneateles as a daring, courageous young man. He en- gaged him by the month, and he was'to stay with him as long as was pleas- ant and desirable. They worked together all summer, and reaped a rich harvest in the autumn. In going to and from their work they talked on various and interesting subjects, thus making the time and the distance seem shorter by at least one half. Their leisure moments were spent in the library, or upon the bank of the lake, beneath an overhanging grape-vine, which crept high up over their heads, and drooped down in many dangling runners over the edge of the tree into the sparkling waters. Here they sat for hours, watching the crested waves as they dashed upon the sandy beach, comparing each succeed- ing wave to each of the endeavors of man to accomplish something, and its final failure. Each wave came rolling proudly on, as perhaps it had done for centuries past, unmindful of the dashed and blasted hopes of its predecessors, until it too shared the fate of its fellows, and was dashed and melted away into nothingness, nor leaving a footprint in the sand. ( O, James,"said Richard, slowly raising his head from the reverie into which he had unconsciously fallen, while a smile lightened his brow, "how futile are all the endeavors of man! He comes and goes like each of these little tiny waves; seldom missed, and soon forgotten. The place which once knew him is filled by others, who, like himself, will soon depart." "I know it, Richard," James replied, confidingly; " we are as noth- ing, oras a bubble that is made in one instant, and in the next destroyed by the cause which created it, and - But, hark! what is that? O, it's the band! Isn't it delightful!" "Ah, it is most splendid!"Richard replied, looking in the direction whence the glorious notes came warbling across the lake. "Such melo- dious tones fill my soul with rapturous enthusiasm. Each note is a word, bidding man rest from his labors, and look for peace and content- ment only in the spheres of the celestial. They sunder the bonds which   WILL AND MARY.            25 bind us to earth, and raise our souls to eternity and God. Each trill- ilg note, as upward it mounts, carries with it our finer being, and leaves us even at the foot of the very throne. It is the language of   i the soul, and it speaks only from soul to soul, infusing and permeating, through and through, the same spirit and feeling which causes it. It is contagious, and leaps from soul to soul with the rapidity of lightning, and the answering chords of sympathy' and love vibrate back from the  .;j soul of the listener, to the soul of him who breathes the melody, the  i same as the love which continually vibrates upon the tender chords of  affection, connecting the object; with the source. There is, as you know, if you have ever loved, a connecting chain which binds us all to- . : ' gether, and along this chain the electric currents of sympathy are con- tinually coming and going. Sometimes it is warning, if you contem- plate a dangerous undertaking; and again it is encouraging, as the ob-  jections can be easily overcome or removed. But, come, let's gomin;  the music has ceased, and the air is growing chilly." Thus saying, they arose and entered the house.  .I! CHAPTER V.. WILL AND MARY.- WILL SENT AWAY.                ' A BOUT one mile north of the Old Distillery, and two miles from 5  Nestoria, the late home of old Ki, a little one-and-a-half story house  stood. It was back from the road, and could hardly be seen through the thick foliage which surrounded this humble and unpretentious    r; abode. About ten years previous to the opening of our story, here resided a man and his family, consisting of himself and wife, two  daughters, and two sons. Soon after, the father died, leaving the estate to be managed by the widow and her children. The house and out-  side buildings and fences, had naturally suffered that neglect, sincei the death of the husband and father, which is to be expected in the breaking up of all families; and since the death of the father, some of i the children had left home as they arrived at years, and had marriedi and settled themselves in life, until all had left except the eldest and the youngest daughters. The former, at the commencement of our story, was aged twenty-four, and the latter ten. Nothing, during all  ? these long and weary years had been done to repair the ravages of  3                            i   26         LOVE ON THE WING. time and the elements; consequently the buildings were much, dilap- idated. But it was the home of youth, innocence, and love, and as such, is entitled to that respect and reverential awe which always sur-  round our dear loved homes; and clustering around this spot, and beneath the overhanging elms, are memories of scenes long since enacted, while some of the principals are laid in the cold and silent t6mb. It was here, and beneath that giant elm, whose mammoth .trunk has withstood the blasts of severe winters, and whose branches nod a silent obeisance over the spot made sacred by the softly uttered love of youth,- it was here that Mary often sat and listened to the flattering words of a devoted lover; it was here, on this classic ground, that William first dreamed and uttered the love of his heart. William and Mary were reared from the cradle side by side, and to- gether they were taught the rudiments of the English language. All through the earlier portion of their lives they were constantly together, neither ever thipking of going to any party, paring-bee, or picnic without the other. Thus was the early love of their youth knit firmly together by the ripening years of life, and by constant endearing associ-  ation. William's love for Mary had twined itself imperceptibly around the tendrils of her heart; and she felt that she did truly and sincerely  love William in return. It was a pleasant October afternoon, in the year 18-, as William returned home from a picnic in Marcellus, that he, after all other sub- jects had been discussed, broached the subject, which had all the while  been uppermost in his mind. He took her hand in his, and, pressing  it tenderly to his lips, asked, in a timid voice, " if it should be his."  "You know, Mary," he continued, "that I have always loved vou, and it has been the secret wish of my life that you would one day be  mine." He dropped her hand; and looked into her deep, dark eyes,    j just moistening with tears, and read his answer there. "Yes," she softly whispered, "I am thine. But when shall it take place?" she asked, and a smile of joy lit up her face. "As soon as you are ready. Let it take place as soon as possible - ! the sooner the better." And, as he said this, he wound his arm round i the fragile form of his betrothed, and imprinted a kiss upon her rosy J lips. Thus his vow was sealed, and his fate decreed. They had now arrived at the gate of her home, and, alighting, he assisted her to the ground, and as he handed her the parasol, she asked,- "Are you coming to-morrow evening?"            ?44   SAD PARTING.            27 "Certainly; you may expect me at seven. If I can't come, I'll    i write. Good night, Mary."                       i A cloud overspread her happy face as she silently bade him good   ;i night. She could not speak, for her heart was choking her utterance.  ' "He said he would write if he could not come. But why can't he  come?" she mentally asked, as she slowly walked up to the house.  She entered, and threw aside her things, then sat down, when her sister, Lucinda, asked, -  "Why, Mary, why do you look so sad? Has anything happened  to mar the pleasure of your journey?"                 ' "O, no, not much," she replied, evasively. It's nothing, only I'm  a little faint and weary." "But I thought it was a splendid day to be out," she said, doubt-  fully.  "The day has been beautiful, and I've had a most delightful time."  i "But there has certainly something happened, for I never saw you look so pale before. Has Will given you the slip?" she asked, while a frown darkened still more the once happy, smiling face. Lucinda was sending darts .of pain through her bleeding heart, and in a voice half reproachfully, half pleadingly, yet full of sisterly tenderness, asked,-           - "O, Lu! Please don't; you can't think how much it hurts me,"     } said she, sighing, and burst into tears; which, when Lucinda saw, she went and sat down beside her, and asked forgiveness for the pain she  had unintentionally inflicted.  "O, say, May; don't cry so. I really didn't think. Come, now, cheer up, and tell me what it is, and I'll cry too. I will help you, if you will only tell," said she, entreatingly.  "No, you can't help me," she said, between the sobs; "no one can helD me; I must bear it all alone." "But, say, May, do tell me what in the world it can be that affects you so. You know I love you with all the confiding love of a sister; and if you have any grievances, it is your imperative duty to share them with those in whom you have an abiding love." "Well, I'll tell you, seeing you must know. As we were riding along, and when almnost home, he asked me to be his wife, and I con- sented readily. I think now I was too fast, and should have held off, and made believe I didn't want him, even when I did. I ought to have  made him tease me a while, and then give him a reluctant assent; but : I couldn't find it in my heart to add one pang to his; and now, instead of his suffering, I'm suffering myself."   28        LOVE ON THE WING. "I can't see, for my part, why you should suffer. He only asked, and you assented. Is this, I pray, what all your trouble is about? You are foolish to let such a thing carry you away." "o0, well, if you will only wait a minute, and let me tell my story,  j#ou'll know more about it. You see, after we arrived home, I asked,-  ' Are you coming down to-morrow evening?' And he said, 'Yes, I'll come down.' And then he said, just as he was driving off, ' If I can't come down I'll write;' and there was something so strange and singular in his manner, that I cannot force myself to believe that he will ever be mine. I have a vague presentiment that clouds are coming, to darken forever the happy future I had pictured to my mind. I fear the joy of my life, the only hope of my heart, is forever blasted," said she, sorrowfully. "I don't think you have any good reason, whatever, for thinking thus. He may come; and if he don't, he may have some good reason why he can't. I wouldn't give up like that if he didn't come. I wouldn't if he didn't write. I'd let him know that I can be as inde-   pendent about a t it as he can, she returned.  "O, Lu, don't talk so, for you never loved, and do not know any- thing about it. None but those who have truly loved, can sympathize withi;me in my distress. I wish I was dead, or that I had never been bcrn,-and then this trouble would never have come. O, dear! what Shall I do if he don't come?"  "O, wa-al, he'll come; I wouldn't grieve so. Come, cheer up, or this  certainly will kill you. I wouldn't feel so for all the men in the world. i I'd let them think I had some spirit and ambition myself. Why, good gracious, there are men enough, and good ones, left yet. Instead  of feeling thus, I would go into the other extreme, and say, I wouldn't marry, for spite; and in this way we could bring the most refractory to their senses. And this, rather than the course you are pursuing, would the most effectually retain the fickle heart of a lover. Too eager and willing an acquiescence is often more fatal to the hopes than a shy, reluctant assent; and, if necessary, we needn't accept at all. Only '  think what a wonderful power we hold in our handa- I wonder why     T in the world I didn't think of this before.. If we were a mind to, we could revolutionize the whole of existing society, by saying we wouldn't any of us marry at all; and then we would see what they would do,"' she said, laughing, and turning to Mary, saw a smile flit across her sad face, and then in a moment all was dark again. William, as was his custom, told his sister Mariah all that had trans-  .    MARIAH'S ADVICE.           29 pired since he left home, not even omitting his engagement to Mary Scott. "Why, Will!" she exclaimed, while a look of evident displeasure overspread her face. "How could you think of engaging yourself  now, and you so young! Why, only think, here are pa and ma, and you and I, and a house full of servants. Where are you going to put  her? Where are you going to live One married couple is enough in any house at a time. I always wondered why young men married so early, and then biing their wives right into the family, as if there was plenty bf room. If I were a man, I'd never think of marrying until I  had a place all by myself, and then I'd try to get just the best there was  in the market. Get some heiress, or a southern belle with a hundred negroes, and be a proud aristocrat. I wouldn't take up with such trash; set your aim high, you're worthy the best." She gavehim this lecture in one continuous sentence, and she could have gone on in the same strain till now if no other duties intervened. William shrugged his shoulders, bit his lip, and rubbed his face, as if removing the gathered perspiration; then turning his aquiline nose from one side of his face to the other, and with a look of mixed rebel- lion and obedience, blandly replied, - "I didn't know how you would like it, so I thought I would just speak of my intentions and see. Of course you are right, and I had  i no business to be thinking about it. I might have known that it  was no use marrying just yet, especially when there is no more room than we want ourselves. But there is no one hurt yet, and she don't care. She just as lief have Dick. Robinson as me, I know by her actions. She thinks the world of him, and I thought I would just hurry up and make sure of her; any way, we won't say anything more about it, and for my part, I don't care a fig. We can get along well enough just as we are, and as for her, she has enough to be comfort- able as long as she lives; so it won't make any difference to any one; and you - " "Well, you see it's just like this," hurriedly put in Mariah, interrupt- ing him. "You see, here are pa and ma, and they, of course, want to rule their own house as long as they live; and if Mary, or any one else were to come here as your wife, you see there would be more or less jarring;  and lpa, you know, is so irritable, that it would bother him dreadfully, you know -you know." "Yes, I was thinking of that."  "And then, you see, pa and ma are getting old, and young folks' wishes and feelings are entirely different from those of older people  3*   30      .  LOVE ON THE WING. neither would they wish to be surrounded by the bustle and gayeties of a young and dashing wife. You wouldn't, neither would I, neither would anybody. Everybody is settled on that point, for it's an axiom of very general acceptance. And there is another thing: pa and ma want you to stay with them as long as they live; otherwise a house, I  suppose, could be built and furnished for you, and then, in that case, there would be the additional expense." "Yes, I know it's objectionable in every light in which you're a mind to view it," he replied, as he cast at her a look of such confiding love that she was half inclined to relent, and let him marry her; and then she thought that, seeing she had gone with him safely thus far, she had better stick to him, and see if she couldn't hold him always within her influence.  "You told her you would see her to-morrow evening?" she asked, with a coquettish smile. "Yes, I must go down to-morrow evening, and partially explain  matters, so she won't expect it to take place as soon as we intimated." "No, you needn't do any such thing," she hastily said, with a dark-  ening brow. "Let it go now as it is, and always keep in her good graces, only put off the day, from time to time, for some plausible rea-  son. This is easy enough, if you're a mind to exercise a little tact; and she'll believe then that you do really mean some time to make good- your engagement; but don't ever hint that you wish it indefinitely deferred."                                I "Well, I guess that will be the best way," he slowly drawled out, and he arose to go.  "But, say, Will, where are you going now?" she asked, surprised at his abrupt withdrawal. He stopped in the half-opened door, and re-  plied, "only down to the office." "Well," and in a moment more he was gone. This was a new circumstance, and the importance of the case de-  manded her instant and assiduous attention. William being of an easy  matter-of-fact temperament, had always made it the rule of his life to  do just as his sister desired, and it hurt him deeply to think that his  cherished project had not met with her approval. He loved Mary-  loved her with all the ardor of his young heart; and he felt the tender chords of his heart snap and crack, as he tried to tear the loved image from around its delicate tissues. It was hard for him to give her up; but it was harder still for him to disobey the expressed and forcibly uttered wishes of his darling sister. Which should he do? His sister was here, she was there, and he loved them both. Could they have changed places,    MARIAH'S PLAN.            31 -that is, Mary and Mariah? Mary would have carried her day, be- cause she would have him more under her constant influence, but as it  was, Mariah was with him every day, and was continually dropping  little words of flattery and love, which always brought a reluctant smile,  and sometimes a hearty laugh. It was in this way she kept him chained to her; but he was often then half inclined to rebel, especially when in the company of Mary--he was half inclined to run away, and  gratify the yearnings of his heart, and forestall the wishes of his sister. Such a thing he had, however, never done, and should he do so now it would be treasonable. Mariah set herself at work with an energy which showed she did not intend to be flanked by any strategy her brother might devise, and in this she displaye the wonderful sagacity of a woman's knowledge of the human eart, in the selection of the means she employed, the words she used, and the smiles she returned. She was accomplished in all the arts of disingenuous intrigues, and she could hide her real motives under a mask of such trusting, confiding, perfect love, that to distrust her, or doubt for a moment the sincerity of her intentions, would be to reflect obloquy upon herself. The motives, with William, were always  left out of consideration, for he never thought nor cared what could be the reason for the objections which were raised to his plans while he thought them so eminently just and right. To know that they were not acceptable to his sister was all he required, as he had never yet  done anything against which she had previously urged her objec- tions. William, now left to himself, strolled leisurely around, now here, now there, seeking something and finding nothing. It was the struggle of love against love, as the wounded bird flutters for the life which is fast ebbing away, and which instinct teaches cannot be retained; and yet, for the sake of the loved ones in the nest, she hopes to defer the bitter moment of dissolution. Mariah met her father that evening, and after telling what William had done, begged to have him sent off on some business, that he might, if possible, partially forget the untimely and injudicious love he had formed; and after she had used all the arguments she had laid by for  that express purpose, he partly assented. "I gad, now, I'll see about this! I'll send him to buying hogs out 'West with Mr. Bordman. I'll have it fixed so they can start to-morrow, on the evening train." He arrived at this conclusion, however, late in the evening, for he had left Mariah in an uncertain state of mind, not  knowing whether to hope for 'help from him, or depend on her own re- 4,   32         LOVE ON THE WING. sources; and when she heard from William that he was to start on the following day for Chicago, she was delighted; and she thought it an ex- cellent opportunity for him, as he would see something of the world, and become acquainted with its ways. The following day was spent in making such arrangements as were deemed necessary for one about to go on such a journey. Old Ki attended personally to every particular, often sending two or three to do, or attend to the doi'g, of a small, inconsequential thing, and then going himself. lHe could implicitly trust no one to attend to the smallest minutiae in such an important undertaking. He was half inclined to go and buy them himself; and he said as much, on more than one occasion, when some little mistake or oversight had been made, evep when he himself could not possi- bly have done better. The money was procured, and properly bound and secured in an inner pocket, and the valises packed with such little necessaries indispensable on such a journey, not even forgetting a flask of good brandy, which had to be brought from a neighboring village, and an express messenger had to be sent for it, when some one of the family was continually going and coming from the place all the time. But during all the hurry and tumult of the preparations, Wi am did not forget the loved and sorrowing heart he was about to leav behind. Towards evening he found an opportunity to hastily drop er a brief  letter, whtch he would leave in the post officeas he went along. It was in these words:-  HART LOT, October 11, 18--. "DEAR MARY:  "Father has been talking some time of sending me with Thomas out West to buy hogs for the distillery, and last, night he concluded we had better start to-day. You will, I trust, excuse my abrupt de- parture, for I assure you it is as unexpected to me, as this will be to you. I would have called during the day some time if the urgency of prep- arations had riot demanded every moment. I will soon return, and until then, believe me, Mary, to be, as I always have been, "Ever truly yours,      WILL."  The morning rose calm and serene, while all nature seemed radiant  with smiles, and every heart rejoiced in the fulness of its glory.  People hurried to and fro, each intent on his own business, while every one thought his affairs the most important of all others in the world, and a careful observer could read the latent emotions of the heart as they were reflected from the face. Some were glad and buoy- ant, and moved with a light, elastic step, while a happy smile lit up their faces, making all sunshine before them. But there was one who I..   WILL'S GOOD-BYE.           33 came with a sad and sorrowful face to the post office, and gently tapping, with a trembling hand, the glass which hid, but did not obscure, the  ' contents of the letter-boxes, she in a moment received a tiny billet doux, and with hope and fear written plainly on her brow, slowly retraced her steps. As she walked she opened and read, while tears came stream-  ing down her cheeks. When she came to realize fully that he was in- deed gone - gone without one parting good-bye, without one parting  kiss, she wept unrestrainedly. By this time she had reached the door of her home, and throwing the -letter in the lap of her sister, retired to her own room, and there, in the solitude of her chamber, let her young heart bleed itself to rest. There her sister found her an hour later sitting on the floor, and her head upon the edge of the bed, sobbing most piteously. "'Why, Mary! I want to know if you are crying about this letter. Truly, any girl of 'sense could notpossibly find a word of fault with it. What is there? Do tell me what it is that makes you take on in this way." "Why, the letter," she muttered, between her sobs. "There is nothing in the letter that should make any body feel like this. He simply tells' you his father has sent him away on business; and such a thing is likely to happen to any young man. He is coming back again." "Yes, but not to me," she murmured between her sobs, and sighs, and tears, her head still resting on the bed, face downwards, and buried  almost out of sight. "Come, Mary, you shall not cry for such a foolish thing," she said, i taking hold, of her head and raising it up, ever so gently, so she could look into her eyes, choked up with blinding tears. "Come, now, let those tears dry up, and be yourself again. Goodness! I wouldn't cry. like that for all the men in Christendom ; and at the same time it's so  foolish and unnecessary; and it was nothing but right and proper that  he should tell you he was going away, consequently would not be able to see you this evening," she said, consolingly.' "I told you last evening he would not come, for there was something in his manner which plainly' told me he wasn't coming. If -there hadn't been anything in it he wouldn't have said anything about writing, but would have come and told me just before lie started; then I would have felt perfectly easy about it," she said, despairingly. "You are over-nice and too exacting in the observance of the rules of etiquette, which have no place in the love of any heart. True love never stands on rule or law, and can be neither governed nor restrained. It manifests itself when affinities meet, and are reciprocally attracted. * * '   .,     ,  f   34         LOVE ON THE WING. It can't go out towards everything and everybody, because everybody wouldn't receive it, but would push it away, saying, ' I'll have none of it.' But let it come from a different source, from a source whence it is desired, and'it is welcomed with outstretched arms and a gladden- ing smile." CHAPTER VI. DESCRIPTION OF NESTORIA. T  HE home of Old Ki, in his last days, was delightfully situated, and around it are associated dear memories of youthful days ; not the youth of those who now occupy it, but of others now living;  and these are as deeply interested in its welfare and preservation -as its present occupants. On the south and east lay the lake, spread out in all its grandeur, its wild scenery and its mythical associations. To the northward lay the farm, spread in grand, rich fields, rewarding a hundred fold the industry of the husbandman. It formerly consisted of about four hundred acres, but latterly some had been sold; it was,  however, sufficiently large to require the undivided attention of him who gladly spent the evening of his days there, in extracting from its willing soil the sustenance of life, and the necessary luxuries of a home. It is bounded on the east by the railroad, on the south and west by the lake and the Cayuga hills, thus sheltering it, as with a mantle, from the shivering blasts of winter; while towards the north was an unsheltered plain. A large perennial spring, from the neighboring  hills, supplied the culinary requirements of the house, together with a beautiful fountain, which bubbled and splashed in the silvery basin, -  a constant, joyous requiem. It always affected one as he happened to  feel: if he was pleased, it heightened his pleasure; if he was sad, it ! added a gloom to his spirits.  The garden, of an acre in extent, lay back of the house, divided into numerous compartments by walks, on either side of which beautiful flow- i ers were blooming; behind the garden was a small, young, and thrifty orchard, and which ran down to the shore of the lake, while near the shore stood a commodious summer-house, on one side of which the boat was housed, during the winter months, under a shed prepared for it, and which extended over the water. A wharf was built out into the a1e at this point, at which a large boat could be moored. There was   NESTORIA DESCRIBED. RI5                i a gentle declivity from the garden, through the orchard, dwn to the  lake, while beneath nearly every tree stood a huge grape-vine bench.  An arbor, also, stood by the brink of the lake, covered with grape-  vines, and which now hung full of the luscious fruit. This arbor was  a pleasant retreat in warm summer days, for through it a delightful   ,! breeze from the lake constantly fanned the heated brows of those who came to while away a pleasant hour. Here one could sit for hours,    i watching the little crested waves, as they surged up noiselessly upon the pearly sands, nor feel the time when it was passing.'  This place was named Nestoria in the legendary history of its earlier / days, and it has retained that name until the present time. It will not be necessary to give a lengthened history of this place, further than to say, that a company of Fourierites attempted to establish themselves  i and their principles here, in the year 1848: but owing to family dissen-  sions, and the grasping tendencies of some of its principal leaders, the enterprise failed, and the families were dispersed. Then it passed into the hands of a theoretical farmer, who, finding that he was daily grow-  ing poorer, sold it to old Ki, where, in this Elysian retreat, he resolved to spend the evening of his days. The house was large and roomy enough for the family now gathered  beneath its roof, though built after the style of architecture which flour- ished in the time of our grandfathers. The interior of the main struc- ture had not been disturbed since it was built, though a large and commodious wing had been added by the Fotrierites, and they were intending to enlarge it still farther, when their financial crisis overtook them. The large chimneys and fireplaces had not yet been removed, and the appearance of the building in general indicated that the hand of time had rested upon it rather heavily; but it has long been the intention of the present occupant to remove a portion, and entirely  remodel the main edifice; yet he has put off doing this from time to  time, for reasons which will appear during the course of this history. The main building is of stone, and the wing is of wood, which runs out at a right angle from the rear of the first, and a piazza extends round two sides of it. It is like the letter L: the perpendicular line is the stone building proper, with its gable to the road, and the hori- zontal line is the wing. The house stood upon an elevated plateau, from which, towards the north, spread out a beautiful prospect, while the west was skirted by hills. Days had melted into weeks, and weeks into months, and months  into years, until seven of them had rolled round, and are still rolling,  thank the I ord, as they have always done, each year bringing new   36         LOVE ON THE WING. sorrows, and, perhaps, endig in new disappointments. As each year moves on, we look around usand see, with urfeigned regret, the cruel gap that ugly death has made in the lines of our friends: here one had  dropped out; there, another; over beyond the hill, still another, weary and exhausted with the long and toilsome march, had dropped  behind, while the moving column pressed on, unmindful of the expir- ing friend, But a few of us are still spared to plod along through the  world, ever and anon looking behind to see how far in advance we are of the grim monster, who is ever following at-rapid pace to cut us down, as he has our dear friends; though we are ahead yet, we know not how long it will be before he overtakes us, and we share the fate of our predecessors. Some of our schoolmates, and those with whom we used to mingle in so much deiight, have either stepped out of the  ranks of single blessedness, or have crossed that shoreless river, never  more to return; while others are still anxiously waiting and hoping to  be relieved of the care of themselves, by either taking upon themselves additional responsibilities, or by shifting responsibilities on to some one else. In fact, some had married, and married well, while others had been more unfortunate, having made an injudicious decision, and had robbed themselves of all that makes life sweet and desirable. Even  with the long catalogue of unhappy marriages before our face as a  warning, we all seem pretty anxious to try our hand, and see if we can- not make a better fight. But because a few have fallen, of faintness  or of a broken heart, on the wayside, shall none press on? Nay; if  we would enjoy all the blessings of life, we must not only encounter,  but tolerate, some of the evils. It is, of course, far better that a few  should suffer from the effects of unhappy marriages, than that all, through fear of being unhappy, should remain single. Some may be  satisfied the first time; and if they are not, why, let them try it again  rather than give up altogether, try again. You may be more fortu- nate, and be able to discover that, which you have spent all your life-  time in trying to find, -one perfectly congenial to your tastes. This is what life is for; it is a struggle for happiness; and if we, in our eagerness to acquire it, fail, ought we not to have the privilege of  stepping back and trying it over again? It seems so to me.   MARY'S GRIEF.           37 CHAPTER VII. THE FAMLY AT THANKSGIVING. - SAIL .ON THE LAKE. IT was one sunny afternoon in the month of November, that all the family assembled around the hospitable table of Nestoria, and partook of a Thanksgiving dinner; and as the old gentleman looked around upon the happy faces of his children, and those of his grand- children, he smiled a happy smile. It was pleasant to think that but one was missing from this joyful assemblage; and while one had been taken, six youthful scions of the stock had risen in his place, and some of these bid very fair to eclipse the ancient sire by the increased glory of their lives; but of this he thought nothing, and cared far less, for. he was purely a matter-of-fact man, and never allowed his imagination to carry him into vague and uncertain theories. There was one whom the eye would search in vain to discover, who might have been, and, perhaps, who ought to have been there. This was Mary. Seven long, weary years had passed since she had become the affianced of William, and still she was not his bride; and during that time she had sighed for the love which had been given her and reclaimed. Her poor broken, bleeding, blistered heart sought content and peace in the bosom of despair, when it should have -been kept whole and entire, and full of contentment and happiness, -should have rested upon the bosom of him who was the first to receive its love. But why was this so? It was because fate, cruel fate, had decreed otherwise. And how did Mary receive this severe chastisement? She received it uttering bitter anathemas against its unjust decrees. She sat, day after day, by the window which commanded a view of the path from the gate to the house, watching, sewing, or reading, her thin pale face showing plainly the sorrow of her heart, which she vainly tried to conceal: while every now and then she raised her head to look out, as a team passed by, or a boy cried, and then relapsed again into a painful reverie, as a thought of her happier days crowded upon her mind, and out of which she could not rouse herself until addressed by some member of the family. Thus life wore on, each day growing more and more bitter, as the chances of his return became more and more distant, until all hope had vanished, and her bleeding heart gave up in despair. 4                         i j,    38         LOVE ON THE W-ING. Poor girl! she did not preside at this Thanksgiving dinner, neither did any of those who sat at the table drop one compassionate tear for the heart which was broken, and for the life which was dead; but they smiled, and were thankful, smiled because they were happy, and thankful that no more were missing. They all partook heartily of the good things provided, and talked the little meaningless things always discussed upon such occasions; but love and matrimony were, never mentioned in the family circle: what was said on that subject was said aside, and out of the hearing of the rest. Mariah was here with her husband, Thomas Bordman, and two chil- dren, a girl and boy, aged respectively six and five. Mrs. Bentley and her children; Isaac, his wife, her sister Sarah, and daughter, aged eight; and lastly, perhaps leastly, the easy and careless William. The aged father and mother were well and happy, though perhaps the latter was a little infirm; still she moved around, and attended to the affairs of the house. They were all as gay and happy as such families usually are, under such favorable circumstances; and when the meal was over, the gentlemen, taking each a cigar and their ladies, sauntered leisurely out into the garden, through the orchard, and in a moment they all stood upon the shore of the lake. The weather was fine, and there hung over the lake and the surrounding hills a curtain of hazy atmos-  phere, through which the sunbeams dimly shone. It was Indian sum- mer, - the most delightful season of the year. The leaves had mostly fallen, and lay in hollows, or heaped up behind some bush or tree, where the rough wind had previously driven them; and the bosom of the lake was gently rippled by a little breeze, which was not cold, but } pleasant.  "How beautiful!" they nearly all exclaimed, as they stood upon the  shore, while little Helen ran to her grandpa, and catching him by the coat, said, "Don't you remember, grandpa, that you promised me we would have a sail on the lake some time?" "Yes, my dear, and you shall have it now," he said, smiling sweetly  upon the inquiring face.                       A The boat was soon released from its, moorings, and all, except the  old gentleman and his wife, who chose to remain on the shore, and watch the party as they sailed around, stepped in. Isaac took the helm, William the bow, while Mr. Bordman entertained the ladies and children, warning them when the canvas swept from side to side. gOc- casionally a laugh went round, as the head of one or another was  bumped by the arm extending the sail. Sarah Perkins, Mrs Wood's sister, sat towards the bow of the boat, and isustained a desultory cod, i   ON THE LAKE.            39 versation, first with one, then another of the company. She, too, like Flora, was a blonde; and though very fair, not so agreeable a compan- ion as Flora; for her manners were stiff and overbearing to even her equals; but towards her superiors, though she thought she had none, she was fawning and submissive. "I think this is the most delightful scene I ever witnessed," Sarah said, with a sigh, as she glanced towards William, then at Mrs. Wood and Mrs. Bentley. "Yes, you are right there," said William, looking over the water in the direction whence they came, where his mother sat watching. "I think I have seen as beautiful on the Mississippi River," said Mr. Bordman, archly, while a cunning smile covered his face. "Pshaw!" chimed in Mrs Wood; " on that tortuous and turbid river. See how clear this water is! Look! you may count the pebbles on the bottom, and it's a huhdred fathoms deep right here;" and she looked around among the group for encouragement, but saw on the face of William a far different emotion. "Come, let's turn back, the sun is getting low," William said, as he glanced at that luminary and then at the shore, as the distance was continually growing greater. "My goodness, you are as great-a coward as ever," exclaimed Mrs. Bordman, in apparent surprise. "The children enjoy it much, and are not in the least afraid." "AtIaid of what mamma - the-water? O, dear, no; don't think of returning yet, it is so delightful!" said Helen, appealingly, looking into her mother's face, and clapping her hanrds in girlish ecstasy. "I guess William had rather be on land, feeding chickens," said Isaac, laughing, and looking around, wondered why the rest didn't.  William yawled, ' O-hum;" and said, "Sailing will do well enough while the sun shines, but when it goes down, the wind is apt to rise, and then tain't usually so pleasant, especially if one gets a ducking before reaching the shore." "Prudence predominates over every other characteristic with Wil-  liam in everything except marrage," said Mrs. Bentley, in an under- tone, as she drew towards the close of the sentence, and smilingly bowed towards Mariah, whose brow darkened, ere she replied,-  "O, William means to marry by'm-by, when he gets older." "If he isn't old enough now, I don't know when he will be," said Mrs. Wood, smiling, as she glanced towards William, then at Sarah. Sarah was pleased, and she turned her head to conceal a blush she felt slowly incarnating her cheeks; but she didn't, for all on the boat   40        LOVE ON THE WING, saw it, and Isaac, to relieve her embarrassment, said, "I'm turning round now, and we are nearing the shore." "Yes, but a good ways frdm it yet," said William, evidently much pleased. "O, mamma, I'm so sorry we're going back. Please, ma, don't," said Flora, pouting. "Why, I'm doing nothing about it. You'll have to talk to your uncle Isaac," replied Mrs. Bentley, looking towards the stern of the boat, and bowing deferentially. "O, dear; he's so cross he won't listen to anything we say," said Flora, whining. "Hush! hush, my dear! you must not talk so," said Mrs. Bentley, in a low voice.  The boat was now nearing the shore, and William stood up, with line in hand, for a jump as soon as she came within reach of the dock. He sprang, and, the distance being farther than he calculated, landed in the water. The ladies tittered, but the children screamed out that uncle William had fallen into the water. He was, however, soon upon the wharf. "Did you get very wet?" regretfully asked Mrs. Bordman, as he took her hand to assist her to the wharf. "O, no, not over my boots," he replied, as he surveyed his lower ex- tremities. "I was in too much hurry to get on terra firma, and I'm afraid it'll be some time before you get me out there again." I suppose you will soon house this up for the winter," suggested Isaac, as he carefully rolled up tWe canvas. "I guess this will be the last time it will be used this year," said William, much pleased at the prospect. "Father tired of waiting, didn't he, mother?" asked Mrs. Bordman, as she approached the place where her mother was sitting. "O, yes; he went to the house a good while ago, saying it was tire- some business sitting here," replied the old lady, rising to accompany  the party to the house.  "I'm so sorry, mother, you didn't go; you would have enjoyed it so much," she continued.  "I'm afraid on the water, and it makes me dizzy," she replied. "I I ijoy it a good deal more seeing others sail," she said, lingering behind to join William as he came running up. " Was you much pleased with the sail?" she asked, as he took her arm under his own. "No, ma'am, not a bit. I never studied navigation," he replied, archly, while Sarah, looking behind, laughed, *               Of   !   WILLIAM  REPROACHED.'         41 "I shouldn't think it would require much study to enjoy such a scen said Sarah, in an aside to Mrs. Wood.  "I declare! William will never be a sailor because he has nev studied navigation. He was not so lively during the whole time we were out as he has been these few moments on land," said Mrs. Bord- man, smiling. "His wit generally comes after it's needed," retorted Isaac, as a satirical smile sparkled in his eye. "I'd rather have it come then than to use it second-handed," William replied, in an undertone to his mother; but Isaac heard it, and his brow darkened, while his sharp, piercing eyes shot a glance of reproof at William, which, had he never before seen one like it, would, for the moment, have unmanned him. It was marked down in the book of his memory, and, as was his usual custom, when the account had run on long enough, he called on him for a settlement. The children had dispersed about the orchard as soon as they landed on the shore, wihile the rest strolled leisurely towards the house. After a little while, Isaac's folks began to make preparations for returning home. Isaac went after his horse, and William followed; and when in the barn, Isaac approached him, and said,- "I wish you could go out without making a simpleton of yourself. I don't suppose you could have stepped on to that wharf, without fall- ing in, if you had tried ever so hard. I should think you was old enough to properly conduct yourself in the presence of ladies," he said, while his eyes, and quick, impulsive movements, seemed to dart ten thousand daggers into the unoffending William, who, rubbing his face, coolly asked if his feet were wet. "Well, it's characteristic of the man, for no one can expect anything but a snap from a snivelling coward; and it'll be a long time before I sail with /ou again." He concluded by giving the lines a sudden jerk, whlch -a cked the horse against the door and broke the thills. "Well, there now! Hold on a minute; let me unbuckle this. There, it's all right; it don't amount to anything. But, here; you can have my buggy if that won't do," William replied, consolingly, as he bustled around quickly from one thing to another, yet with a mixture of pleas- ure, because the accident would turn the subject. "I can't see what in the world made that horse act so," said Isaac, wonderfully pacified. Another wagon was soon brought around, the horse hitched on, and they were finally ready to start; and after talking a while, with one foot on the step of the carriage, he got in; and, while fixng the robes, he 4*   42          LOVE' ON THE WING. was earnestly talking of grain, of hogs and whiskey, until; from an impatient gesture of his wife, he drove off as far as the gate, when, recollecting something, he called to William, and said, ("Tell pa I'll come over early, and will see about buying that boat load of corn that is coming." "Yes, sir, all right; " and William bowed. "Now don't forget it," he yelled at the top of his voice, as he was driving through the gate. "No;" and William muttered something to himself as he passed into the house. CHAPTER VIII. CHARLIE AND SARAH RIDE OUT. XTVHEN Mrs. Wood married Isaac, she had one brother and one T  sister; and she stipulated in her contract of engagement that they should have a home with her until they married, or wished to with- draw. To this Isaac willingly acceded; for her parents had lived in rather limited circumstances, and she did not feel as if she would like to leave them to grub along in the world as they could, while she entered upon a life of ease and luxury; consequently, it was a wise provision which she made for them, as they were entirely alone, and de- pendent upon their own resources. Their father was negligent of his responsibilities, and their mother had died during the infancy of the boy; but now they were rescued from their precarious position and placed above the reach of want; and with every advantage put within their reach, we will see what use they made of it. When Sarah came under the roof of her brother-in-law and bene- factor, she was eight years of age, and from that time, until her intro-  duction in the last chapter, she had been kept constantly at school; for Isaac, proud of her many personal attractions, had resolved that neither expense nor time should be spared in preparing her for the highestpo- sition in society; and as she grew up into womanhood, she grew in knowledge and understanding, while Isaac looked with mingled pride and satisfaction upon the rich blooming flower - which was expanding into such exquisite loveliness -he was fostering with so much care and solicitude. Day by day he observed the change which was being  wrought by constant application to her studies, and by the judicious    SARAH DESCRIBED.           43 investment of his funds, and by his own repeated wishes that she should lose no time in qualifying herself for any position she might be called upon to fill. He had repeatedly told her that he cared not how much it cost; he would consider himself amply repaid for all the care and ex- pense she had caused him, could he only see her mind richly ladened with the science and accomplishments of the day. Such was the care bestowed upon the opening bud: we will now admire the full-blown rose.. It was a beautiful afternoon in June that she stood upon the piazza. - carelessly watching the clouds as they chased one another across the sky, at the same time nervously whipping the leaves from a lilac bush which stood close by. She was attired in a riding dress, with jockey hat and plume, which hung heavily over the left shoulder, and the long trail she held upon her left arm, and a silver-mounted riding whip in the other. Her hair was of a rich golden color, and braided into a heavy chignon. Her eyes were of a deep blue, over which arched a beautiful and commanding brow; her nose small and straight, her teeth of pearly whiteness, while her lips were fashioned in Nature's most perfect mould; her chin small and dimpled, and a rich beautiful crim- son mantled her cheeks, and her ftce was small, round, and full. In her bosom - which throbbed with all the ardent passions of her nature -there beat a heart as proud and as fickle as ever beat in a human breast. She courted the admiration of every susceptible being; and when she had reduced him to submission, and at her feet, spurned him with the contempt he merited. She reckoned her conquests by scores;  while all but one had laid their hearts at her feet, and which, by her, had been ruthlessly trampled into the dust. She was anxiously looking downr the road for some one with whom she expected to ride that afternoon, and she began to grow impatient at his long delay, when a horseman appeared, leading a prancing pal- frey by his side. He was well mounted upon a dashing charger, while his gay trappings set him off to an excellent advantage. As he rode up to the gate, he raised his hat, and bowed politely, saying, "Good evening: I see you are ready, as usual, and waiting." "Waiting! .I've been waiting this hour," she answered, pettishy. "Indeed! I'm sorry to have delayed you so long. I said I would be here at four; what time is it now?" he asked, dismounting. 'f Time! It's nearer five than four," she replied, consulting her watch. "There is plenty of time left yet to ride as far as we wish. Whic. road do you prefer, the ulpper or the lower one?" he gently asked. "I think the one that runs along the lake shore the most pleasant; let us take that one."   "        LOVE ON THE WING. "Well, I'm satisfied. Here, you've dropped your whip," he said, as he kindly handed it to her. As soon as she was fairly in the saddle, she dashed off at a headlong rate, leaving Charles Spencer to follow at his leisure. He soof caught up with her, and his horse, in a foam, was reined up to her side.  "I have, caught you, you see, at last," he said, smiling sweetly, as  she turned her roguish eyes upon him, and slackened the pace of her impatient steed. "So I see; but if I had chosen, you couldn't," she said, still petting and coaxing her horse. They rode on some little distance-in silence. "Come, now, Sarah, you know you promised me you would give me an answer to day," he said, as a shade of mingled doubt and hope over- spread his face. "Answer! Answer to what?" she exclaimed, in apparent urprise, while a curious smile twitched her lips. "Why! have you forgotten, my dear, so soon? You know you said, Sunday evening, when I proposed, that you would give me an answer to day," he said, earnestly regarding her the!while.  "O, yes! I recollect now. You spoke of matrimony," she said,  surprised, just as if that subject hadn't been in her mind all the while. '" O, well," she continued, " there is time enough yet. Wait till-we get  back. I don't like to talk on that subject on the highway," she said, as if relieved of an oppressive burden. "Excuse me, Sarah, but I flattered myself that it was as pleasant a  subject to you, as I feel it is to me," he replied, blushing. "It is not unpleasant, Charlie, but I think it is out of place here,"  she said, turning upon him one of those bewitching smiles, which  thrilled through his being like an electricshaft, and seemed so comfort- ing and assuring, that he felt confident of her continued love.  ( You have put me off with some such excuse every time I have men- tioned it," he said, jerking the bridle of his horse. "Then they must have been good and plausible reasons," she said,  restraining still more the pace of hers.  "To you they have always seemed sufficient, but to me they are quite the reverse."  "It's because you're so impatient, and unwilling to wait. But, hush! there's a party coming. I don't want every one to hear this." They said no more until opposite the party, when a gentlemanly-appearing young man raised his hat and bowed a good evening, which Sarah politely returned. "Who is that young man?" he asked, when sufficiently advanced to be out of hearing. ]    PHLOSOPHY.            45 "Why, that is Richard Lovell. I thought every one knew him. He raises tobacco for Uncle Ki." "And that other young man?" he asked. "He's his hired man, and they are great friends, I believe. What a delightful view we have now of the lake and wood and blossoming flower. Look! the trees are all clothed again in their summer attire, and the birds are skipping from tree to tree. Isn't it splendid?" she asked, exultingly. .  "It is most beautiful," he replied, though his heart ached for the love and sympathy it so much required in return for that which it had given, and which he feared was fast fading from his view. He was im- patient to return, for the scene had no charms for him while he was in so much doubt. "How much farther will we go " he asked, glancing at the sun, which he saw was sinking behind the hills. "O, not much,'.' she playfully responded. "I thought you a great admirer of nature." "So I am, but it is the nature of the human heart I have studied most, and would be much pleased to learn," he said, as a smile of min- gled sweetness and sorrow overspread his face. "Ha! is that your study?" she asked, in surprise. "You are en- gaged in a useless and unprofitable task, if you allow that to absorb much of your attention; for you will spend your life in it, and die not knowing." "So you esteem it useless and unprofitable, do you?" he asked, bit-  ing his lip, while the words rang in his ears like a death-knell.  "O, why, not wholly so. I thought you referred more particularly  to all the passions of the human heart. Some of them every school-    i boy knows," she replied.  "So I did. It was the nature of the human heart, and thiA includes all its passions." "Do you believe there is any passion in the heart?" she asked, in- credulously. "Why, eyery one locates the passions there; I don't suppose, though,  that the heart has anything more to do with them than any other organ of the human system; still it is accepted as the seat of the passions, and I don't see why it should be changed. But, come; let us turn around: see! we are most at the head of the lake, and it will be dark before we get home."' He reined his horse across the road, ahead of her, and waited her reply. "Well, I guess we might as well ride back. You are not afraid, are you?" she asked, as the shadows of the wood were drawing around them.  i,   "        LOVE ON THE WING. "No, but I dislike so much being out on horse late, and you will be so tired when you get home that you won't consider your promise," he said, half doubting then of getting a reply that night. They rode home in silence,and much faster than going, and they arrived there about nine o'clock, where she found some cousins await- ing in some anxiety her return. Charles hitched the horses at her re- quest, and, with a palpitating heart, walked in. She showed him into  the parlor, and excusing herself a few moments, while she relieved herself of her riding-habit, she in a few minutes rejoined him. He had busied himself examining the pictures on the wall, and some man- tle ornaments, but he was not so deeply absorbed but he observed her entrance, and, turning around as she approached, took her hand, and reverently raised it to his lips, and as he led her to the sofa, whispered softly, * Now, say, Sarah, is it mine?" To his anxious heart and willing ear there came feebly, half-reluc- tantly, yet plainly-whispered word, " yes." He put his arm gently around her, and drawing her nearer to him, imprinted upon her rich, ripe lips the betrothal. It seemed to affect her very much, as it for a moment threw her off her control; but recovering herself, and dismissing the burning sensation of the kiss from her feelings and mind, she quickly assumed her wonted composure. The remainder of the evening was passed in the same manner as such evenings usually are, and as if nothing of much importance had oc- curred. The subject of matrimony was seldom alluded to by her, and when it was by him, she adroitly managed to change the subject into  another channel, without in the least exciting the suspicions of her lover. When he arose to go, she followed him to the door, and suf- fered him again to caress and kiss her good night. She stood there, the light from the room revealing her splendid form in white muslin, till Charles was out of sight, and, as he'was disappearing, he waved a kiss, of which she knew nothing. Charles Spencer was a young man of accomplished manners, manly form, regular features, yet tanned by exposure to the sun. He was a farmer's son, and educated as farmer's sons usually are, it having been l finished by attending two, possibly three winters at the Elbridge Acad- emy, under the professorship of Buibank and Wright. His circum- stances were easy, as his father, with only one other heir, a lady, was worth about twenty-five thousand dollars. The farm, of one hundred and fifty acres, would, undoubtedly, one day be his, together with money in the bank, while enough would be left for the young lady, when she wished to step out in the world. Thus there was nothing to  e                               !    SARAH'S ANXIETY.           47 prevent this from being a happy union; and, as all werewilling, Charles looked forward, with eager anticipations, to the time when he would bring his beautiful and accomplished bride to the home of his father. He loved her, too, with all the ardor of his young soul; and that night, as he lay down to rest, he prayed that she might be kept from harm, and soon return home to his love and embrace. Visions of her beauti- ful form, and her face all beaming with smiles, rose up before him, while the sound of her pleasant words was continually ringing in his ears. Once he found himself rising to grasp an image which he thought was right before him. He awoke, and seeing his mistake, smiled, and fell back upon his pillow. But see how different is the repose of Sarah. She shut and locke4 the door with a sigh of relief, and said, "I'm glad it's ended. I fan- cied I loved him when I said ' Yes,' but I don't. I know that can't be love; still, I do kinder like him, after all, and if it wasn't for , I certainly would marry him." She was going to speak the name, but didn't. That night, as she lay, turning restlessly from side to side, she thought the matter all over, and' wished 'he hadn't encouraged him at all. She would sleep better not thinking of his love, for she knew his heart would break when he came to know the truth. But ,then - pshaw! What of one man's heart, when there are so many. I don't care. She tried to persuade herself that she didn't care, but sleep would not relieve her of her thoughts and let her rest. "I do wish," she sighed aloud, " that it was played out, and I was married to some one, I don't care who, Or else that the subject was dropped, and never mentioned to me again; for. I'm sick, heart sick, of this continued flutter and agitation. I am half a mind to run away and marry, and thus end the subject with regard to him anyhow; then let others torment themselves, about marriage, and property, and connec- tions, and all this and that; it's enough to drive one crazy. I'd rather A be married, and have a house full of young ones, and live on a crust of bread, than to be tortured to death in this way. Ellen says wait, and Isaac says wait, something may turn up by'm by, so as to bring things round just as we want them; but this waiting for some one to die, just for one man, is what I don't like. I will! I declare to good- ness, I will! I'll write to Charley, teliin, him to meet me in some place, and be married on the sly. Then it will look as if I had given up the fight, while some one else ill win the victory. No, I won't; I'll wait, and see what comes of it. I needn't marry at all, for that matter, for Isaac says I can stay here as long as I live, if I want to; and I must live somewhere, of course. O, dear! I wish I could go to   48         LOVE ON THE WING. sleep. How much more pleasant it would be to lie down, and sleep contentedly and happily, surrounded by a happy family, a loving and indulgent husband." Thus soliloquizing, she at last fell asleep. She arose with bloodshot eyes and a pallid face, showing plainly she had passed a sleepless night. "Why, Sarah! how you look! Are you sick? or what in the world ails you? I never saw you look so forlorn and dejected in the world." "Why, to hear you go on, one would believe that I couldn't live all day. For my part, I can't say I feel very ill; but the long ride I took yesterday tired me some, and I felt quite fatigued last night on going to bed. That's all. I don't think it's anything we need feel much alarmed at. I think careful nursing will restore me to my usual health in about an hour," she replied, archly. Isaac presently came in, and sitting down to the table, asked Sarah how she made out with Charlie. "What's the matter of you? you look like a ghost," he said, wonderingly. "I don't see why I didn't ob- serve you before.- Did you give him an answer, so he won't trouble you any more?" he asked, with mingled pride and anger. "Yes, I gave him an answer," she answered, sullenly. "Well, you needn't speak quite so sharp about it. I asked a civil question, and should like to be answered in the same manner. I sup-  pose this is all the thanks I'll ever receive for saving you both from the poor-house, and I wish now I -had let you go, wife and all; and I would, too, if I had known you was going to repay me with this in- gratitude. It's the way I get paid for all my kindnesses." "Well, I wish you had. I should have been a good deal better off  then, as some poor man's wife, than I have been, or ever will be here,"  she said, pettishy, and arose from the table, leaving the breakfast untasted. After she had gone, Ellen told him that she had engaged herself to Charles Spencer. His brow darkened, his lips closed firmly, while his eyes darted flames of living fire. He raved, and tore, and swore most  horribly, until his wife, with tears streaming down her face, begged him to desist, for fear the hand)of an angry God would strike him   l dead. "I don't care if He does," he angrily exclaimed; I'd rather die a hundred times than to live in such a family. Such ingratitude! I,  who have done so much, and spent so much for both of you. Where  would you both have-been if I hadn't married you?" "If we had both died, we'd have been better off," she answered,  between her sobs and tears.     THE ORPHANS.            49 "Yes, and you can uphold her in rebelling against. my wishes. I'm good notion to turn you both out doors, as ever I had to live," he said, angrily. I'll tell you what I'll do. Give me a house, - I don't care, great or small, if it is so I can turn round in it, - and ten thousand dollars, and never darken my doors again, and I'll call myself blessed, and you a saint, and hope and 'pray that you may die one," she said, while her heart was throbbing in her throat, but her tears were dry. "Well, she shan't marry him. I'm bound if I'll be thwarted in that way by a couple of love-sick geese, so long as I have one stamp left. You talk of ten thousand dollars; what right have you to one cent of my money, I should like to know? I won't give either of you an- other red cent, if you don't conduct yourselves differently from what you have along back," he said, angrily. After a storm there is a calm; so now, when the fury of his wrath had spent itself on the head of his unoffending wife, he subsided into i; a quiet, and a remarkably mild man. But the fury of the storm was plainly visible, after it had passed over, by the wreck and ruin it had caused. The trace of tears, where the flood had been the greatest, could be seen on her cheeks, while the sun was shining pleasantly    1 down, and seemed to mock at the desolation of shattered hopes, of  blasted peace. The same storm, in the course of its perambulations,  visited other places with equal fury, but doing far less damage. We  will see, in the next chapter, where it went.  CHAPTER IX. WILL AND IKE.- WILL AND HS FATHER AND SPENCER. HE little orphans, Flora, Helen, and Edwin, progressed finely in their sttdies, and all had, with the exception of Flora, ceased to mourn for their father, who had been dead now nearly a year. Their grandpa used occasionally to take them all out riding, and this helped wonderfully to revive their drooping spirits, and led them to think life much more pleasant than they had at first supposed. They visited their father's grave, decking it with flowers, and watered it with their tears. As soon as the snow was off in the spring, grandpa had told them 5    50         LOVE ON THE WING. that they would go to the grave, and take some flowers and an ever- green wreath. Accordingly when the weather had become settled, and the mud somewhat dried up, the large two-seated wagon wasacked out, brushed up and oiled, and they all started. A gravestone was being cut at the shop; but they had no difficulty in finding the grave. As soon as Flora came within sight of it, she began to sob and sigh, and she appeared to be very much affected by the recollection of her beloved father, which the sight of his grave revived. Her grandpa said, "If you are going to feel so sad; I won't bring you here any more, but I'll let Helen and little Eddy come." "I can't help it, grandpa; indeed I can't," she sighed. And with her face buried in her handkerchief, as if the walled-up tears were just ready to burst out, yet couldn't, she said, looking up sympathet- ically, "He used to bring me so many things every time he came home, and I used to climb up on his knee and search his pockets for candies and nuts, and while I was eating them he would tell me a pretty story. Now I don't get these things, nor hear the stories, and I have no papa to love." "Why, you can love me, can't you?" he asked. "Yes; but you ain't the sahfe as pa was, after all. I can love you better as grandpa, because you are so old." "Well, come on, let us be going. We will drive along up the lake, and try to forget our sorrows in admiring the beauties of the scene." They drove up some way, thinking of the objects of interest, the many beautiful residences, the warm and genial hospitality of its citizens, all of whom were well known to the old gentleman; and while he told of the pleasing incidents he had experienced during his long business career, a tear rolled down his cheek and dropped on the sleeve of his coat. His voice trembled with the emotion he felt, when he spoke of how many had dropped away, and, he continued, "I suppose it won't lbe long, before I, too, will be numbered among the-"His voice fal- tered, and, whipping up the horses, he soon turned upon other and more agreeable subjects. He drove as far as Mandana, and then turned around and came back. William drove down to help weigh off some cattle, which were being  shipped to Albany; and after they had been driven to the railroad and 1 carred, they all took'a drink at the drover's expense, and returned. Isaac had no difficulty in introducing a subject, for he blurted it right out, and never cared to consider whether he should commence here or there, or whether he should say this or that; he depended wholly upon the exigencies of the occasion for the language which he wished to em-   MATCH MAKING.            51 ploy, and he seldom, if ever, was at a loss for words sufficiently poig- nant to express his meaning. Some, however, form their speeches all beforelind; and if, as often happens, the current of the conversation, by the adroit management of an opponent, is turned into a different channel from the one he intended it should flow in, he is swamped, and because he has no speech arranged for that emergency, has nothing to say. He slackened the pace of his horse, - they rode together from the still - and asked,- I suppose you intend to marry pretty soon, don't ou?" "Yes, as soon as I can complete the arrangements," William replied. "Well, as soon as you get your arrangements completed, I hope you won't overlook Sarah, whom I've educated at so much care and ex- pense on purpose for you. She would grace the salons of Paris, and would make a fit consort for any king. She is amiable, gay, and ac- complished, and withal will make a good, industrious, and an economi- cal wife. You needn't shrug your shoulders, nor turn your head away, for you know that every word I've said is true, and all the reason you've got against marrying is your consummate obstinacy. You al- ways was so, and I expect you always will be. I never could get you to do anything that was right, but you will be into every mean and outlandish game, which will bring neither reward nor honor." "Just as soon as I get around to it I'm going to marry, and I'll give Sarah a call." "I don't want you to call, nor to have anything to say about it, unless you mean to go through; for if you don't have her, she is going to marry Spencer. She is engaged to him now, but if you want her, and will marry her within six months, why, it's all right; otherwise she is going to marry him." ^ I don't like to interfere with anybody's matrimonial projects. If she is engaged let her marry him, and I'll find some one without break- i.:g any one's heart.", "You needn't be afraid of breaking his heart. I'll risk his heart," he replied, authoritatively. "But who will risk mine?"the asked, alarmed, "when he sends me a challenge to fight a duel with him for taking away his affianced?" "I will. You needn't be alarmed at any duels. I'll fight all of them for you," he quickly replied. "Suppose you are killed, who'll fight them?" "Well, you needn't prolong the conversation any longer about it. You'll talk of fighting duels from now till the day of resurrection, and be no nearer marrying then than you are now, if any one is fool enough   52         LOVE ON THE WING. / to talk with you. For my part, I never could see the expediency of a man's being a fool all the days of his life. I always thought you would outgrow your sluggish, stupid indifference, and that age, and a knowl- edge of the world would infuse into your mind a desire to do pretty near as other folks do; but the older you grow, it seems, the more stupid and careless you become." Well, I'll come down and see her about it. But, mind you, if there are any duels to be fought, you must fight them. I don't like duelling."  "I'll attend to the duels. But, say, come down Saturday evening," he  said, imperiously. - "Well, I'll come down Saturday evening," he said, turning to go away.    d     b "Say, now, don't forget, because I'll make arrangements, and you'll } be expected."  With this last injunction in his mind, William started off towards  home, wondering if he would really have any trouble with that    t Spencer. It made him very uneasy to think of the probable conse- quences of the rash enterprise, and it readily occurred to his mind, whether true or not, of a young man in similar circumstances, who had  his brains blowed out for meddling in the love affairs of another. He *  didn't want anything to happen to his brains for that or any other  offence; and how could Isaac save him, or take upon himself his re- sponsibilities, if the injured lover sought to avenge the wrong done,  him on his own guilty head. The lover would fight with no other than him, and on him alone would he mete all the vengeance of his wrath; and whether duelling were justifiable or not, the enormity of the offence would, in part, excuse a man for seeking such reparation, which was the only one within his reach. He could not hope for justice at the hands I of a legal tribunal, neither would he expose his own weakness by seek-  ing it there, and the only honorable course left him would be one of violence; and his frame involuntarily shuddered as such a contingency  presented itself to his fanciful imagination.  He arrived home about five in the evening, and entered with zest i into the duties of the occasion, in the vain hope that he could thus  banish from his mind all thoughts of the subject. He was heedless of  the wishes of his father, who told him to have the cows driven into the  lower yard, where there was a long, open shed, under which they might stand while being milked, because of the threatening storm which was then gathering in the west. It was late in the evening, as his father chanced to look out of the window, and saw the cows standing and shivering in the cold, drenching rain, while the dirty water from the side  of the cow was drizzling down into the pail.   ABSEN T MNDED.           53 "I gad, now, a-hem; you're a smart fellow! I wonder what you're thinking of. Why didn't you put them cows where I told you?" he asked, in a voice trembling with the excitement of his rage, while he interspersed his remarks with profane expletives, which added greatly to the efficacy of his words. "Wa-al, I forgot it;" and he rubbed his face as if it was covered with perspiration. "You forgot it! I wonder you don't forget to eat. O, no, you won't forget that. But, another time, I'll 'see if I can have them cows put where I want them; and I'll do it myself, if I can't depend on any one. You go and see if they have hung that tobacco or not, and if they haven't, come and get a light and hang it up. Now see if you can qo that. I ain't going to have that lay on the ground all night. Come, now, hurry." And he hurried, all the while thinking of his probable duel, and he found the tobacco all hung up right, and he came to tell his father that "Spencer had the tobacco all hung." ' That who had it all hung?" he asked, looking with mingled curiosity and surprise into his face. "Why, Richard. Whom did I say?" he asked, blandly, and turning white round the mouth, for fear he had betrayed himself. "Why, you said Smith, or Spinner, or some such name." O, well, I was only thinking of-thinking-" "Thinking of who?" roared the old man in a rage. "Thinking of Smith, who bought that balky mare, and hasn't paid for her yet." "No, you wasn't; no, you wasn't; you wasn't thinking of any such thing; you needn't tell me that," the old gentleman quickly rejoined. "You've got into another love affair. I can tell by your looks and actions," he continued, as William quietly absented himself. William never allowed himself to argue with his father, for what he said was law and gospel with him. If he wanted to do anything dif- ferent from the regular routine, he dropped a word, or hinted at it, or somebody else said so and so, and he thinks it the best. Sometimes the old man would yield, but oftener he didn't; but if anybody wanted anything that he could grant, without incommoding him too much, he would yield, if they stuck to him and coaxed him enough;  otherwise he turned in disgust and walked away, leaving the applicant  to follow or go his way. His business he conducted on different prin- ciples: for what he wanted he would have; and his business was so varied, that it required the help of others; consequently, if he had any 5*             . 'i   54         LOVE ON THE WING. trouble with any one who could be of any use to him in any of the de- partments of his business, he was the first to make a movement towards a reconciliation; and if the man was a gentleman, and wished to con-. tinue friends on business terms, he would meet him half way; and if he didn't wish to live on any terms with him, the movement which he made. towards a reconciliation resulted more in making him a friend than a foe; and it is believed that, though he had a great many alter-  cations with those among whom he associated and with whom he dealt, i not one of them entertained towards him any feelings of hatred, or a sense of wrongs received; while he, himself, believed that there was not,  through the whole world one man who was his foe. This feeling sweet-  ened very much the cup of bitterness which his physical condition  presented during the evening of his days. William kept thinking of his engagement all the evening, though he  took care not to be much in the company of his father, who would call  him in from the barn, where he loitered with the men, talking of busi- ness and events, to talk and be company for him; then he would come  in, and, after sitting a while, when the conversation flagged, rise and go out again. The widow and her children occupied a room up stairs, so in the  i evening they were not much with the family, except to sit for a few moments, or come down for a drink of water; consequently the old folks were pretty near as much alone, at least evenings, as they would have been had Mrs. Bentley remained in Chicago. The children had  retired, so had their grandma, and it was getting high time for all to  "turn in," as William quaintly expressed it, yet he knew no sleep would be his; but he had to put himself somewhere for the night. After see- ing that the lights were all out, and taking a peep into the wood-house, and out doors, in the direction of the smoke-house, and trying the door which his mother, speaking from her bed, told him to see locked, he  mechanically ascended the stairs to his room, and the last word he whispered to himself, on stepping into bed, was, "I really don't like duelling; " while a muscular twitch of his lips and forehead told plainly the uneasiness of his mind. (, I    APOSTROPHE.            55 CHAPTER X. APOSTROPHE. - WILL PREPARING TO SEE SARAH. THE sun was rising calm and serene, smiling on hill and dale, and purling brook; and as the fog lifted, which hung like a curtain upon the hills, and bent down to kiss the apple-blossoms just opening, there rose up before the mind of the beholder, if it was not clouded by sorrow or dulled by stupidity, a grand panoramic view. The curves of the creek, as it meandered down over rocky beds, through thick and ever-shading hemlocks, spruce, and poison sumach, were shown by the fog which arose from the stream; while huge columns of smoke went circling up from tall chimneys which so thickly lin6d the banks of the stream, and told where the busy hum of industry would soon be heard, where looms were weaving -the garments we wear, while we were weaving the threads of life; or where iron was fashioned from the rude scrap, which was to hold together our carriages and cars iii which we ride with so much comfort and rapidity, and where paper is made, on which we delight so much to rest our. eyes when an entertain- ing story is stamped thereon. The whistle for six from Dickerson's factory, had not awakened the echoes among the sleeping hills, nor aroused the sleepers in their little cottages which lay so thickly scattered along the banks of the creek, so snugly ensconced beneath the wide-branching sycamore and the high-reaching elms; but the robins had trilled their morning songs, and had gone to the fields for the worm which was given to their hun- gry young, while they took theirs on the ground; the wren and the lark were chirpig their little ditties right under the windows of fair sleepers, while quickly flying from twig to twig, and sipping honey from the opening flowers, or catching little insects upon the leaf, or under the shaggy bark, where it was trying to hide itself from the ravenous bills of the little birds. Nearly all were loath to rise and view this splendid scene, spread out on purpose to relieve the dull mo- notony of uniformity. , But the cowhoy had risen, and was fast gathering the reluctant cows together by the cheering sounds of his voice, which was heard echoing through the woods and among the hills, where they lay scattered far and wide on the hill-side, or in the valley below. It was pleasant to   56      LOVE ON THE WING. lie still, half dozing, and hear the melody of that voice as it warbled the drover's call, and which the cows had learned so well, and from  learning, loved to obey. They could be seen rising, one after another, as the song drew nearer, and more and more imperative grew the wish ; and marshalling themselves together, and in single file, they commenced their march towards the yard. But William was up, and was out heading off the horses as they came dashing down from the lot, so they wouldn't run across the yard on the flower-beds which the little children had taken so much pains to make, and through the shrubbery, which had been nicely trimmed in the spring, after having been so long neglected. He had opened the gate for the cows, and he stood cleaning against the post of the piazza, watching them as they strolled slowly along, one by one, into the yard, and even counting them as they passed by. He was sad and dejected, and failed to observe the beautiful scene spread out before him; or, if he observed it, he failed to note all the beauties' of it. His thoughts were too busily engaged in solving the riddle which Destiny gives to every one, and which we are compelled to unravel, whether we will or not, either to our own or to another's advantage. There is a time, a moment, in the lives of all, when the weight of a feather on the balance of our minds will incline us to the one side or to the other; and when once the step is taken, the die is cast, and our destiny is sealed. We cannot recall that moment, and place ourselves in exactly the position we were in then, to undo what we have done, and commence again; neither will the same moment ever come twice.: When gone, it is gone forever, never to be reclaimed. Other moments will come, and be just as happy to some as others which have gone before; but the same circumstances are not there, and some of the fa- vorable chances are wanting to encourage and recommend us. And we look back, with a sigh of regret, to think that we chose a path so rugged, so beset with thorns, when we might have known, if we had thought, that it would be so and so. I thought this, and that, and everything,  but I really didn't think it would turn out in this way. It behooves us, therefore, to consider well, and do nothing: of the propriety and expediency of which we entertain a single doubt; for one false step taken then influences our whole life, makes us despondent, and life, which should have blessed us, a burden. And this riddle Wil- liam was now trying to solve; and he asked himself, over and over again, should he marry, or remain single? He didn't know. He could go down and see Sarah, and determine afterwards whether he would marry just now or not. It would satisfy, for the present, those most s   THE OLD BACHELOR.           57 interested in it, and possibly lead to pleasant and profitable results; but the truth of the business was, he didn't like to meddle in other's love affairs, while, if she were unengaged, it would be different, and he wouldn't feel half so reluctant about it. He concluded, at last, he would go and see her, and let circumstances direct his' future course. Now William was not much of a gallant, still he could pick up a lady's handkerchief, and return it with the grace and dignity becoming a country gentleman, and could hand a lady in and out of a carriage politely enough; but he was timid and bashful. In a mixed company he was much embarrassed, but in the company of those with whom he was well acquainted, he was perfectly at home. lIe was not so forward as some, but he was polite, courteous, dignified and alffble. Conversation would not flag, and a company felt perectly easy in his society. If he had mingled more in the society of ladies, and less with rowdihe would have been a perfect ladies' man ; but he habitually isolated himself. from the company of ladies, if we except his own family, and the consequence was, that he mixed in his conver- sation a good many slang phrases, of which a lady would have broken him, had he been entirely under such influence. He loved the society of ladies in general, and his own family in particular; but as he had partially resolved never to marry, he felt reluctant to encourage hopes which he feared could never be realized; nence his timidity. What made him more desirable was his great wealth, while he was an easy, good- natured man. He would have made any one a good husband, and he might have been a kind and indulgent father, and a firm' and steadfast friend. Such was the old bachelor, William Wood. Evening at last came, - came far too soon for William; for he had watched the rapid decline of the sun in dread and fear, as a criminal looks forward to the hour of his execution, and he could hardly believe that it was so late until he consulted his watch, and found the sun was going his regular pace. He soon prepared himself for martyrdom; neither did he array himself in his best, as a lover should, nor feel the same pride in it; but with a careless indifference he selected this ar- ticle of apparel, and that one, with the remark, that they were good enough for a man to suffer in. William had spent some evenings in Sarah's society bef6re, and had taken her to several parties, dances, shows, and other places of amuse- ment; but nothing definite had ever been said about marriage, though it had been alluded to incidentally. They had hinted quite plainly on t the subject, and both understood that it was desirable to consummate, 'by marriage, the love of this promising couple; and this love had been   58         LOVE ON THE WING.  encouraged and fostered by all, and in every way that could be devised;  still it was in abeyance, and had not progressed to the end desired by J those, most interested in furthering the project, although William had been often urged on the one hand to expedite his arrangements,  and complete the union all had so long intended should have taken place long before now.                         I William's sister had as often opposed this, with all the warmth and fervor of her soul, and had thus far been successful. As no one ap- peared very anxious, it was not urged so emphatically on the start as  it was later, for the reason that all thought that necessity would com-  pel him to acquiesce in the arrangement which had been made; and for this reason, we hase omitted to mention at length the meetings of these singular lovers. Much had been said previous to this by all par- ties, as we intimated in the restlessness of Sarah on the night of her betrothal with Charlie Spencer; but for fear of making the story ob- scure by the recitalof frequent and similar scenes, we have thought it best to concentrate in a single chapter the result of the plans of years.  It was intended from the first, by Isaac and his wife, that Sarah should marryWilliam; still they permitted her to receive the company of others, in order that the neighbors might think she intended mar- riage, and to conceal their main design on William. Thus strangers were wholly unaware of the deep plans which were laid by this schem- ing party, and nearly all thought that Sarah did really intehd to step off with one of the offers she was continually receiving. She, no doubt, loved Charlie Spencer; but the influence of her interested relatives prevented her from fulfilling the contract into which she had entered. She no doubt loved Richard, but the whimsical follies of Isaac, and the wishes of Ellen prevented this union, which afterwards they regret- ted having broken, when they became positive that William would not marry. He cut himself while shaving, in several places, and the blood stained his collar, and it was with great difficulty he buttoned the bosom of his shirt, the holes being new and too small for the large studs he had to put through them, and before they were adjusted great drops of sweat were standing all over his face.- His socks were new and his feet were damp, and before he succeeded in getting them on, his face grew very red, while his eyes sparkled with indignation. At last he was ready; and then he had to wait an hour for the old folks to go to bed before he dared to venture out; then he-went down the back way, carrying his boots in his hands, and he stepped into a puddle of water' carelessly  spilled there by one of the men, who, while bringing in a pail of water,   FOUND OUT.             59 in order to get a drink, hit the pail against the door-casing, and slopped some over on the floor. After swearing at the carelessness of some one, and getting another pair of socks, he made out, by the aid of a match, to step on the dry parts of the floor, and to get out without arousing the folks. He then had to get the horse out without leading him across the floor; so he took him out at the back stable door, andl backed the buggy out himself, and after hitching on the horse as quietly as he could, he seated himself in the buggy, and was driving slowly out towards the road, when a window was raised, and a white head put out, while a loud voice was heard, demanding " who that was, and to bring that horse and wagpn back."  "There!"said William, in a whisper, "'m caught at last. I'm only going down to Ike's a little while,?' he blandly replied. "Well, I gad now, you ain't going down to Ike's; and you just put that horse and buggy hacK in the barn again; and when you want to go down to Ike's, or anywhere, come to me, and ask like a man, and go away like a man, not be sneaking off in that way." William turned round the horse, muttering to himself about wishing he was old enough to be a man, and was driving towards the barn, when the same window again went up, the same head was put out, and a voice was heard, saying,-  ," Well, you might as well go ahead, seeing you've got so far; but the next time you want a horse in the night you come to me." William muttered that he had a notion not to go at all; but finally he started, and arrived there just as they had given up his coming, and were preparing for bed. If the old lady had not whispered, "Let the boy go, he is old enough to take care of himself," it is not very likely that he would have changed his mind so quick. Sarah had taken more than usual interest in the arrangement of her toilet, and she had cdnsulted her sister what was best to wear on this occasion of William's visit. It had been decided that the fleecy'white  tulle was the most becoming to her light and clear complexion and spark- ling eyes, which on this occasion appeared more bright and clear than ever before, while little bows of violet ribbon set off her remarkable beauty to a wonderful advantage. She thought, as she surveyed her- self before the large mirror, which ieached from the ceiling to the fiqor, of the sitting-room, that she would to every one, other than William Wood, be perfectly irresistible; but she knew that to him her sweetest smiles and softest words would fall like impotent darts upon his iron- clad heart. But whatever she lacked, would be more than compensated by the great influence. Isaac had upon his weak and vacillating mind; 1o     ,a wekaii   60         LOVE ON THE WING.                 ' and while the latter's heart said no to all the entreaties addressed to it, the loud voice of Isaac would be heard commanding it to yield to the dictates of nature, and be a man, filling the sphere allotted to him, adorning! his life, and making his home glad with the music of a happy family. She entertained many doubts as to her success, while she could not but fail at farthest, and possibly she might succeed; at any rate,  he was worth the attempt, and she wouldn't be any worse off than others had been. She thought of Mary, while she knew she would live through it in either case,. and not pine and mourn as Mary had, be- cause of an unrequited love. She was not going to throw herself away on any one, not even William; and she would appearas if she didn't care a fig whether he loved her or not, while all the time her heart was aching for the love it felt, yet dare not show. Sarah and Ellen had a long talk on the subject at the supper-table; and afterwards, while she was assisting her at her toilet, and while she commented upon her superb beauty,'and her sallies of wit, and spright- liness of manner, she said,-  'Now, don't be too forward. I've heard of winning such old bachelors by cold indifference, by a distant, icy reserve, interspersed with gay and  laughable witticisms. You want to wind round him the meshes of love, i and torture him until he yields. Now, I'm confident that Mary was altogether too fast, and she made him sick with too much trusting,  j clinging, confiding love; she looked up to him with too much tender, unspeakable reverence, while it only flattered his vanity and conceit,  without appealing at all to his finer, better nature. I've found, from painful experience, that it's not the best way to think men so perfectly  immaculate."  "O, wall!" she impatiently interrupted, "William is no more to be compared to Isaac than daylight is to darkness: William is as much above him, in all that pertains to man, as a man is above a boy. I would much rather have married poor, and to have taken in washing for a living, or have drawn my baby back and forth in a little wagon, and to have lived happy and contented, than to put up with his growl- ing insolence, tyrannical abuse, and live in this splendid magnificence.  He'll come in some time, his face all beaming with smiles, and radiant with love, while his flattery and caresses will make any one sick, per- fectly sick of him; some other time he'll come in with all the madness and fury of a revengeful monster, while his tongue utters such horrid blasphemy that it makes one's blood curdle, and his hair to stand up- right. I'd call upon the heavens, or the mountains, to fall upon and crush me to powder, before I'd marry such a man!" and she finished with a sigh of relief as she thought she was not married to him,   A LATE VISIT.            61 But with William the case was entirely different. He would sooner los his right hand than to speak a cross word to any one, and to a lady especially; at least he never had, and it was fair to presume that a man's future would be no worse than his past life had been. She was willing to run the risk, anyway; others had married, and why couldn't she? Because her sister had been so unfortunate, it was no reason why she should be, and she knew she wouldn't if she married William. i"I don't believe he'll come now," Sarah said, while a low sigh was just audible, as she turned partially rond before the glass, and tossed her head scornfully over her shoulde to see the graceful trail of her fleecv robe; and as she looked, a smile curled her lipas she thought how exquisitely beautiful she was. "You know, he said he would come downl and play euchre when Susan Granger; Elen Barker, and Charlie were here, but he didn't come a' step; and I don't believe he ever intended to come. There is one thing certain; if he don't come, I'll never speak to him again." "Don't say so. You know what a queer man he is," Mrs. Wood pleadingly interposed.' "I don't care for that. If he is queer, he needn't lie like that. If there is anything I hate, it's a consummate liar." "Well, you might as well go to bed, and not stay up all night wait- ing for him. I'll give it to him in the morning," Isaac yelled from the adjoining bedroom. "Why,' say, you better speak a little louder and wake up the children, and everybody else in the house. If there is any one going along the road, they'd think some one was being murdered, to hear such a voice as that," said Mrs. Wood, looking towards the bedroom door. "But, hark! What's that!" said Sarah, looking up astonished. ", that's nothing but a wagon going by," said Mrs. Wood, confi- dently. "It's him! He's coming!"Isaac said, in a low voice. "But, say, you run up stairs, as if you had gone to bed, so he'll think we weren't expecting him at all," said Mrs. Wood, hurriedly   ! rising, and giving Sarah a light.  In a moment she was gone, and William heard the flutter of gar-  ments and the rustling of silk as he knocked at the door, and he took pains to look, as he walked up the path and saw no lights at the win- dows, save in the hired girl's room, who was reading a chapter in the Bible, or sewing a rent in her dress, which was torn by the stove-hearth projecting out too far. The thought struck Sarah's mind, as she was going up stairs, that possibly he had failed to observe any lights in her 6   62        LOVE ON THE WING.  room; and if so, the first stratagem was caved. But she didn't care if he did; she could be going now. Mrs. Woodrose and opened the door, and to her surprise there was William. "Why, William! we wasn't expecting you at all. Look! we were just going to bed," she said, as she pointed at the apron lying across a chair as if she had just removed it, and which had lain there  all the evening.                   .  "Ha! a-hem; I'm sorry," he replied, as he took her hand, and she took his hat and coat; "I am really sorry I couldn't get away earlier, but I had so many things to do, and I expected you'd all be a-bed. Next time I'll try and come earlier," he blandly replied, and she looked into his blue eyes and saw no guile there, but such innocence, that to doubt the sincerity of those words would have been profane. He had learned to control his features so well that you couldn't detect the least sign of insincerity, even when he was telling a barefaced lie; and should you look incredulous, and appear to doubt the truth of his words, he looked so like a picture of wronged innocence, that you became imme-  diately sorry for having harbored a thought of his insincerity. You couldn't tell anything by what he said, while it might be true, and it might be a veritable lie, for all you knew, and which you had to depend wholly upon subsequent events to confirm. If he told you he was going to do this, or that, you couldn't tell whether he meant it or not; and not till you saw it done, could you tell whether such were really his intentions or not; consequently, he might just as well have said  nothing at all, as far as giving any oile a correct idea of what his in- tentions really-were.                        I CHAPTER XI.  WILL AND SARAH. - SHE AND ELLEN AND IKE COUNSEL. E took the chair she placed for him, and as he seated himself  composedly, with the air of a man perfectly at home, be asked, "Is Sarah at home?" "Yes ; she just stepped out the moment you entered," she said, and glancing towards the door through which she had gone, at the same time rising and going towards it. "Ha! here she is now," she exclaimed, as Sarah swept gracefully into the room. "Mr. Wood was just inquiring for you, Sarah," she said, retreating towards another room. ?       WILL AND   SARAH.          63 "Good evening, Mr. Wood," she said, in a low voice, and advancing towards him, while he arose, took her proffered hand, which she allowed him but to touch, and said "Good evening," and was about to resume his seat, when she, leading the way, asked him into the other room, where a warm coal fire was burning in the grate, and before which they both sat. They sat and conversed on the topics of the day a while, and then he asked if she would not play one of her favorite pieces before it was too late, as he did not wish to disturb the sleeping members of the household. At this she rather objected, as she did not wish to waste the golden moments which fortune had so kindly presented. After a little coaxing she consented to play one short piece, after which she re- sumed her seat by the fire. He had studied all day how he was to en- tertain her the hour or so he was to remain, but now, just as he wanted to use some of the words he had selected, they all forsook him; but as she opened the concert, one thought produced another until it camne back to him, and his face lit up with a smile as he surveyed the large field of thought over which he had prepared himself to roam. "How did you enjoy Samuel's infair " she asked, looking down into the fire. O0, very much indeed; it was splendid," he replied. "But I didn't see you there." "No; I had such a terrible sick headache all day that I made up my mind I'd stay at home.' "If I had known you were not going I would not have gone, for it always seems so much more pleasant where you are, and I expected so much to see you," he said, looking into her blue eyes, and moving his chair close to her side. She colored slightly, just enough to make her look more lovely, yet offered no resistance, as he put his arm over on the back of her chair. "'Then you were disappointed in not seeing me there?" she asked, looking up into his face and smiling. "Yes, indeed I was; and I didn't stay so long as I would if you had been there to come home with me. I was thinking to-day how pleased I should be to have an infair," he said, while a cunning smile lit up his face. "But I was not aware you thought of marrying so soon," she said, appearing to be surprised. "I'm most happy in assuring you that such is my desire." " a! and may I be so bold as to inquire who is to be the fortu- nate bride?" she asked, while an incredulous smile played upon her face. "If you will allow me to be very bold, I will say that I hoped it would \   "        LOVE ON THE WING. be the lady by my side," he said, while volumes of love shone from his eyes. She colored more deeply, even down on her neck. "Strange you hadn't said something more about it," she said, doubt- fully. It's not because I didn't wish to, but because I wanted to reserve it for this special evening," he replied. "But why more especially this evening than others which have gone before?" she asked, returning, for the first time, a little of the love Wil- liam had all along been manifesting, and trying to extort from her. "Partly because I had not fully resolved, and partly because I had thought I was not old enough," he said, as his arm dropped upon her shoulder, where his fingers had been twisting the ribbons of her hair. "Pshaw! As for that matter, you've been old enough this long time. I don't believe you mean what you say," she said, still doubtfully. "But how shall I convince you of my sincerity? You know there is nothing like getting a good ready," he hurriedly said, as he saw she was about to say something. "By proposing, and preparing, and marrying," she said slowly, still keeping his mind on the first part of the sentence. "If you don't believe me sincere when I say I wish you to be mine, how can you think me sincere when I ask you to be?" he said, learnedly. She saw the drift of the conversation, which was to get her consent without asking, yet she wished to answer without dropping the subject; for if he really did mean to marry, she wanted to keep him in the humor; so she said, - "People thinking of matrimony are generally more demonstrative than you have been. ' You know you have been rather remiss of late in your attentions towards the ladies." "I was not aware that I should be very severely censured for my derelictions of duty, for I surely intended to discharge conscientiously all my obligations, and if I have not succeeded, I hope you will not at- tribute it to wilful negligence, but rather to my lack of judgment, which may, you-know, be at fault, while the wish and intentions are good," he replied, and with such a look of injured innocence, that she was sorry she had spoken so abruptly. She was looking down into the fire, not knowipg exactly what to say next, when he took her hand in his right, - is left was still on her neck, - and said, "Well, I'll try to makramends, if I have been so remiss, by asking if this shall be mine?" anr he raised it to his lips, and, as he saw she offered no objections, he gently drew her head over on his shoulder and kissed her forehead, which was flushed with crimson, while the answer which came back   ENGAGED.             65 was not a negative; and then he kissed her lips, which burned there like a living coal of fire. "I hope now you won't put me off, as you have Mary," she said, her head still resting on his bosom. "Mary! I didn't know as I had put off any Mary," he said, in ap- parent astonishment. "What! Have you forgotten her so soon?" she exclaimed, rising up, and looking into his face. "Who told you I had put her off?" he asked, wondering who in the world could circulate such a report so detrimental to his interests. "Who told me?  Why, she told me herself," she quickly rejoined, with pouting lips. "Well, she'd better been telling that to somebody else," he said, ab- stractedly.  "I guess she did. I think every one round knows it. Then you wasn't engaged to her?" she asked, in mingled pleasure and surprise. "Why, engaged, no! I never was engaged in my life before. You say I'm engaged now, don't you " "Well, I should think you was; but perhaps you will say in a year or two you never was engaged to me," she said, doubtingly, "No, I won't; for I can't say that without telling -" "I suppose you never told one in your life?" she asked, interrupting him.                                 t "Not that I recollect of; and if I have, I'm-sorry.^ "It's very little good it will do to be sorry after the evil is done," she replied. "I'll tell you what I'm going to do as soon as we get organized: I'rm going to take that old wing away, and make it into a separate dwell- ing; and then I'm going to tear down that old chimney, - it seems too bad to take it down, it's done such good service, - and raise up the old kitchen wall as high as the front; and then, you see, I'll make an ex- tension out towards the west, that will open into the dining-room with folding doors, and then make a bay-window out by the fountain, where you can sit in the afternoon and sew. It will be so pleasant there, I know you'll like it much. Then I will make lother repairs around, as we think it best," he said, in a careless, abstracted kind of way, more to pass away the time than for anything else; and every time he came to the end of a clause, he pointed with his finger on his knee, and he marked out there the shape the house would be in when finished. "Why, you're going to have quite a fine place when you get it all. done," she said, smiling sweetly. 6*   "        LOVE ON THE WING. "O, yes," he blandly replied. The conversation flowed on uninter- ruptedly for some time, the moments flying faster on such occasions than at any other time, when he said, - "But say, Sarah, what time will you bet it is?" taking out his watch. "O, it's about twelve. There, you see, it's ten minutes past," she said, pointing to the hands. "Yes, I say ten minutes: it's two o'clock. There, you see, don't you?" he said, holding the watch up before her. "The time has passed amazing fast, as it always does when I'm with you. I wouldn't have believed, for the life of me, it was twelve yet," he continued. "O, well, never mind; there's time enough yet," she said, as he arose i "'tain't late yet." But he stood up, and began buttoning his coat; then she stood up, and they talked a while with their backs to the fire, his knee resting on the chair he had occupied. Finally, he put the chair back against the wall, and moved towards the door, she following. In the hall he put on his coat and hat, and then, taking her hand in his, and his left around her neck, he kissed those rich, ripe, red lips again, and, as he bade her good-night, he vanished from the door. She stood and watched the receding form out into the darkness, until he was Out of sight, and was gone. "I wonder what Charlie would think if he knew of this," she men- tally thought; and then she hastened in, locked the door, and ran up stairs, and, quickly disrobing, threw herself upon the bed, and tried to forget in sleep what was not pleasant to think of awake. She was tired, it was late, and she was sleepy, and she slept soundly till late in the morn- ing, when she arose much refreshed, and with buoyant spirits descend- ed to the dining-room, where she found Isaac and Ellen awaiting her. "Good morning," she said, as she opened the door, her face beaming all over with smiles. "Why, good morning: you seem much pleased this morning. I suppose you are pretty well satisfied with the result of last evening's visit with our brother-in-law," Ellen said, as she looked up in mingled surprise and admiration, as her young and pretty sister swept gayly into the room. "Yes, I'm satisfied, perfectly, that I have succeeded at last, and I don't mean he shall put me off as he has Mary, though he said he never was engaged to her, don't you believe, nor to any one else; but you know he tells such awful stories, there is no believing anything he says," while a coquettish smile played upon her face. "So he did finally pop the question?"Isaac asked, in pleasurable sur- prise, as he took a roll of warm bread from the plate which his wife  had just set before him.   ?    DDANGERS OF DELAY.           67 "Yes, sir, he did, and he is fast now if he never was before. You know when Samuel was married, we went as far as Niagara Falls with them on their wedding tour, and I tried to get him to talk marriage then, but he wouldn't. We had such a delightful time, and we did en- joy it so much. I never shall forget how ludicrous William looked when he stumbled and lost his beaver in the water as he was walking on the slippery stones, with his gray hair flying in the wind," she re- plied. "You didn't go with Martin D - when he was married? No, I know you didn't, for he was married in New York, and we never knew anything about his young and pretty bride till he surprised us by bring- ing her home," Isaac asked, as he rubbed his face with his napkin, and then laid it all rolled up in a bunch on the table. "Why, yes; I saw her when she was visiting at Mrs. Brown's, the summer before he was married, and it-was there, I believe, that Martin first saw her. I don't wonder that he fell in love with her, she is such a pretty woman, while 5her heart is just as good as her face is pretty. She is vain and proud, like all the rest of us; but with all that she is as good as the day is long. If I were a man, I should like just such a woman for my wife," Sarah said; and Isaac arose from the table before she finished the sentence. "I wonder if he will try to put you off, and say he never was engaged, just as he did Mary," Ellen asked, as she sipped her coffee. ** No, indeed, he won't I'll let him know he hasn't Mary to deal with now," Sarah replied, while her blue eyes sparkled with fire. "O, what can anybody do with a man who is dilatory in fulfilling his engagements, and always protesting that he ain't quite ready, but soon will be?He kept telling Mary all the while that he would soon be ready, when he didn't intend to comply. That's the way he put her off; and he'll put you off in the same manner, if he puts you off at all." "Well, he won't put me off at all. I'm going to hurry it right along, and make him marry just as soon as I can get ready. Isaac, you know, is a powerful auxiliary, and Mary didn't have any one to plead her cause. There, you see, is where I'm ever so much ahead of her. We can do almost anything when we have such great influence to back and en- courage us,"' Sarah said, while her face lit up with a smile of hope, as she thought of the many advantages she had over those of her unfortu- nate rival. "Yes; but you know there is Mariha, his sister, that hateful thing, won't let him marry, for she is so proud and vain, that she wants to dress out all the money she has, thus leaving none for her children, but   68         LOVE ON THE WING. whom she will manage to keep along by some hook or crook as long as she lives, and then William, seeing them poor and needy, will take them under his wing, and give them his great wealth. But I thank the Lord my children won't need any of his money, for there will be some left here if-I can manage right. I don't mean to spend all I get hold of for dress; but if that proud minx is a mind to do it, let her, for on her own head will fall the maledictions of her children, for having brought them up in such woful idleness and extravagance, that all the wealth of a Croesus would be insufficient to supply their inordinate desire for display. Their effeminate minds will be incapable of grasping any real or solid advantage, and they will seek only to gratify those lower pas- sions which their mother is so unwisely instilling into their youthful minds, and which she ought rather to hold aloof, and teach her chil- dren to shun," Ellen said, while her lip curled scornfully. "O, well, I'll tell you how we'll manage that. I'll tell him that it will be such an agreeable surprise to her, that we had better marry as privately and as soon as possible, and not let her know anything about it. I can easily make him think so, if I alone have his confidence; while she is away off there she won't be likely to hear anything of it, un- less some gossiping fool writes it to her on purpose." As she said this, a shade of painful doubt passed over her face, which was but a moment before radiant in youthful beauty. "If she is bound to make him live and die single, she certainly will carry the day for she has been his constant adviser so long, that he will not have sufficient strength of resolution to carry him over this matrimonial bay against her wishes, and land him happily on the other shore a married man. She has such a strange gift of tongue, and he has listened to it with so much deference and respect so long, that it cannot fail to have its influence with him even now,' said Ellen, de- spondingly. "But she won't know it; I tell you she won't know it in time to put in her protest, and I wish you wouldn't talk so, for it is really pain- ful to hear you. I can't even think of a failure as possible; and such a thing shall not happen if foresight, diligence, and perseverance will accomplish anything. What! will he live single all the days of his lifeP Who will do the housework? and won't there be scandalous stories afloat if an unmarried woman lives with him? It will do very well as long as his parents live, but what will he do when they die? That's the question," Sarah said, while her lips pouted, and her eyes flashed the indignation she felt. "O, well, I wouldn't be carried away with it. We will manage it as   EATING SNAILS.           69 shrewdly as we can, and marry you if possible; but I have not even the most remote hope that he will ever comply, and - " "There, now, hold on; don't say any more," Sarah interposed. "I won't hear you talk in that way; there, that's all there is about it. You don't know how it hurts me." And she laid her hand upon her heart, whose beatings could be distinctly heard. "I didn't mean to say anything painful to you, my dear sister, but I do not wish to encourage hopes which I fear can never be realized, and  " - "There, now, you are running into that strain again. If you per- sist in talking thus, I'll get up and leave the table. I should think you would call in Mag, for she must be hungry; and who knows but she has been listening at the door, for she can. have nothing to do now," Sarah said quickly, and rising, went towards the kitchen door to see if there was any one eavesdropping; but, no, there wasn't, and Ellen presently called in Mag to breakfast. "You must be hungry, Mag," Sarah inquired, whWe avmischievous smile flashed upon her face, as Mag came in bearin a plate of rolls, which were crisped around the edges, for standing so long on the hearth. "Indade, faith an' I am that. It sames to me that you've bin a mighty long time ating yer breakfast this marnin', aside from other marnin's. I was that hunger that I commenced ating the rines from the ham, that mistress Goodle used alhas to throw to the dog; and it put me in mine when we all landed in Amerikee, that me father, bless his soul, he's in haven, I hope, gave a pint of ginnas, every cint he had, for a pint of snails, he was that much hunger," she replied, as she sat down and commenced at the breakfast, now cold and unpalatable. "Why, Mag, you must be mistaken. I guess they were oysters, were they not?"Sarah asked, incredulously. "An' sure I thought it was snails. They were round, flat things, in shells, which they opened, an' he ate 'em right out of the shells," she re- plied, still doing ample justice to the food before her.   70         LOVE ON THE WING.             Hes CHAPTER XII. RICHARD AND JAMES LEAVE FOR THE WAR. pHE spring of 1861 dawned as beautiful and fair as ever upon the 1  homes of our childhood, and the graves of our revolutionary fathers, who fought, and suffered, and died for the freedom and inde- pendence of Young America.  For half a century our fields had blossomed with the rose of peace, and the toil of the husbandman had been rewarded a hundred fold; whose home was content, smiled upon as it was by the most liberal government the world had ever seen  whose fields were never desecrated by the onward tread of the war-horse, and whose ears had never heard the rattle of musketry, or the distant booming of the cannon. But the times had changed- not the passions of men, for they are ever the same; actuated by the same impulses, cheered by the same hopes, and dampened by the same fears,.the same as when the first human blood was shed by the death of Abel, The political wrangle of years had at last culminated in open and avowed rebellion. Fort Sumter was beleaguered by an armed foe, and at last capitulated before reinforcements and provisions could arrive. It was a cold, bleak, windy day in March when Richard bade adieu to his mother and friends, and hastened with all his youthful ardor to the seat of war, there to bury beneath its sod his crushed and bleeding heart in the defence of the country he loved so dearly, or to heal it by the acceptance of that love he had vainly offered to the beautiful and accomplished niece of old Ki, with whom she was living, and where Richard first made her acquaintance; but the insuperable objections of old Ki and William, who, perhaps, entertained for her more than a cousin's attachment, had forever torn this, the first love-dream, from Richard's heart. He hastily made his preparations, having sold his tobacco for one half a cent more than any one else received; and after placing one thousand dollars in the bank for the use of his mother during his absence, he took his departure with a mother's blessing. "Now, my son," she said, as she wound round his neck and ears the comforter her love had provided, and to which Richard kindly objected, saying, "he thought he would not need it on the cars, nor on the boat, nor beneath the tropical sun of the South," but to which she w6uld not   THE PARTING.            71 listen. "You ale going," she said, " to fight the battles of your coun- try, and drive back the rebellious foe, and reclaim again our sister states, severed from the parent stem by the ruthless hand of sordid, as- piring men. Fight bravely, and do not flinch; pushing back the rebel- lious waves of treason, which are beginning to surge over the fair fields of the. South. It is my only regret that I have not other sons to send out in so noble a cause as the reestablishment of our glorious Union of States in all their pristine glory; while my prayers " (here her voice was choked by her rising emotions) " shall ascend hourly to the throne of grace, that you may-be restored to me, and that the struggle may be short, and as few as possible of the southern youth, as well as our own, may be stricken down in this mad, fratricidal, and useless strife." She encircled his neck in her arms, and imprinted a kiss upon his hot and feverish lips; and while tears were streaming down her face, she tremblingly said, "Good by, my son; and carry this Bible with you, reading it morning and evening, wherever you are, and in whatever duty, and pray to God for your salvation, and the cause in which you are engaged, and for your dear, absent mother," she said, as she placed tfe holy book in his pocket. "Mother," and his voice was tremulous, "you always have my prayers and best wishes for your comfort and happiness. There is money in the bank; use what you need, not sparingly, for I will send you more when that is gone. Good by, my dear mother," and he kissed her again. James was ready, and was also going. He took the aged matron's hand, and was about to press it to his lips, when she, interrupting him, said, "No James, not my hand, but my lips. You have been a friend to my son; be one to him in the future. Take this, James, and read it morning and evening, by Richard's side," she said, as she placed a little Bible in his hand. "Good by, James," and she kissed him ten- derly upon his cheek. Richard left the home of his youth, where his happiest days had been spent; and as he passed out the gate, he turned to take one last - perhaps his last- look of his beloved home, nestled so snugly be- neath huge giant elms, whose leafless branches towered high above the chimney-tops they so vainly tried to shelter from the driving storms of winter, and beneath whose ample shade he had sported in the sunny days of his youth, the memory of which he recalled with a sigh, while a tear rolled down his cheek, and froze ere it fell upon the drifting snow, now piled high against the picket fence. To think he was leaving all the comforts of a delightful home, a fond and loving mother, and the   72         LOVE ON THE WING. faces of thedear companions of his youth, who had been his associates in school, even upon the same bench, weakened for a moment his pa-  triotic resolves; but he pressed on, regardless of the driving storm. As he turned the corner, and was about to dash down the street to i the post whence the stage-now on runners-started, he turned  again, and saw his mother in the door waving him adieu, and crying  bitterly. He crowded back his own rising emotions, and pressed on. Not a word was spoken as the twain struggled on through drifts, now up to their middle in a deep bank, then again on the trodden road, till they reached the. sleigh. Not a passenger occupied the seats, only the deep muffled driver, with a horn at his mouth, who was vainly trying to blast forth, against bleak winds, the time of departure; but only a faint sound could be heard at the distance of a square, like the moan- ing of a dying man. The horses were impatiently champing their bits, and pawing in the fast falling snow, while the white bristles and freez- ing foam plainly showed how intensely cold it was. In a moment all was ready, and off they started, tearing madly through the driving storm and drifting snow, requiring the utmost exertions of the experi- enced and gentlemanly driver to keep them in due subjection. At last they reached the Junction, after having been upset only seven times, and nearly smothered beneath the heavy robes - all of which were appropriated to the sole use of the occupants, Richard and James. I The train was also delayed, else they would not have arrivea in time, in consequence of the great fury of the storm.  "This is a terrible day, James, to leave home and go forth to bat- tle," Richard said, as he shook the snow from his coat and hat, " isn't it?" "Yes, indeed it is; but, never mind, we'll soon be in more comfort- able quarters, and the storm may abate," James replied, casting his eyes towards the west, where lowering clouds were hanging thick and i heavy, unmistakably showing that one could hardly hope for much abatement for the present. But in the cars, where a comfortable fire was burning in the stoves, one would not be exposed to all the fury of i the elements, which, like the passions of men, were seemingly trying  to vie with them in the intensity of their hate. The whistle blew, and  the cars moved on, with difficulty at first, and the wheels cracked, and snapped, and grated on the frosty rails, while the snow was falling faster and deeper upon the already covered track. Still they toiled on, and arrived in Syracuse six hours behind time. The train, which had been waiting here to carry them on, had moved away, despairing of their arrival, thus leaving the young patriots be-   SNOW  ON THE TRACK.          73 hind; but they had time to refresh themselves before another would start. Another train was forming upon the track, and they ensconced themselves comfortably in one of the cushioned seats, while they mutely uttered thanks for the modern achievements of science, in pro- viding them with such a comfortable conveyance. Abraham and Isaac never dreamed of cars and steamboats; neither did Alexander the Great, nor Cesar, nor Antony, nor Augustus. The most obscure of moderns would be loath to exchange places with the greatest men of antiquity, with all their greatness and renown, if by so doing they were denied the pleasant comforts of home, with speedy and agreeable transit from place to place. The trains were delayed all the way through, and many accidents might have occurred but for the diligence of the railroad officials, who performed their duty inthis blinding storm, even during the long hours of the night, in a manner and with a promptitude which merited the highest commendations. The train arrived near Poughkeepsie twenty- four hours behind time, and in the dead of night. Many stops were made to shovel and clear the road before farther progress could be made; but not until many efforts by the engine had been made, which would back up, and then run with great violence against the drift, which tried hard to forbid farther advance. In one of these gigantic strides the engine was thrown from the track; but the cars remained on, and no damage was done, aside from delaying the train till morning, near the place above mentioned. After the engine had been replaced, the train again moved on, and after a while arrived in Albany. Richard thought that, seeing they had such bad luck on the cars, they would try the boat from Albany. Consequently, in the evening they went on'board the Hero, which lay at the wharf, moaning under a great head of steam. The river was open, and the boat had arrived from New York that morning, so there was no danger of further delay, and in the morning they would be in the great city. The boat was loaded, and she was swung off into the river, and she steamed down proudly through the yielding waves and cakes of ice. The storm and wind had ceased, but it was freezing cold, and the passengers sought the genial warmth of the luxurious cabin, which was one clear blaze of light from the massive chandeliers, which hung in dazzling bril- liancy from the arched ceiling. A Brussels carpet, of the softest texture, covered the floor, while divans, and ottomans, and sofas, and easy rocking-chairs were arranged round the long cabin. Under the three chandeliers, which flashed and rattled. with every motion of the boat, now grating between huge cakes 7   74        LOVE ON THE WING. of ice, stood three mahogany tables, covered with novels, and books of travel, and biographies, and all the late newspapers and periodicals of the day. On the sofas and around the tables the passengers were ar- ranging themselves, or moving listlessly round in quest of some friend or relative with whom to while away the pleasant hours of the evening, either in conversation, or at a quiet game of euchre, or whist, or seven- up, and, perhaps, some were already playing bluff, for the chink of coin could be heard in a dark corner, mingled with the laughter of dis- sipated mirth. Supper was preparing below, for the fumes of the fragrant coffee, and broiling steak, and mutton chop, came gratefully to the olfactories of i the hungry passengers, some of whom seemed waiting impatiently for the sound of the gong which would summon them to the luxurious re- past. Large fields of ice had been encountered, through which the  i boat triumphantly cut her way; but it was piercing cold, and ice was gathering upon the wheels, and upon the frame surrounding them. Once the boat had stopped, and, backing up, had propelled herself against a refractory sheet of ice, which seemed for a moment to forbid farther progress; but she cut her way through, and was again making good time among large cakes of ice, which crumbled beneath the giant strokes of the paddle-wheels. Soon the gong sounded, and all made a rush for the dining-room, where a hospitable table was spread, steaming hot from the kitchen to the left. Soon all were seated, and waiters were hurrying to and fro  with plates and dishes, serving with alacrity every wish and whim of the many passengers. Richard and James were there, watching with  curious interest the pleasurable emotions of those around. This was the first time Richard had been so far from home- the first time he had mingled in such a gay company; and the rich surroundings which everywhere met his eyes, excited passions which had heretofore r lain dormant in his breast. He thought how much he had lost, and how little he knew of the affairs of the world. His own life had been spent in the quiet village of Skaneateles, in which, and on the borders of the beautiful lake, his own home, Cottage Grove, was sjtuated. He contrasted the present with his future life, and he sighed for the good old home he had left - could it be forever? In his imagination he saw his mother seated alone by the kitchen stove, the table drawn up, and with knitting-work in hand, her feet upon the hearth, while his own chair stood vacant on the opposite side. His mother always placed it there, and his slipp -a under the hearth warming while he was at home .  and during his absent, the same chair and slippers awaited his coming    FROZEN UP.             75 by the stove. Many times, as she placed them there, she sighed, and wished he would soon return to cheer the desolate hearth with his smile and presence. Soon the supper was finished, and the company repaired to the cabin. Richard took a seat by one of the tables, and scanned abstractedly the pages, while his mind wandered back to the scenes of his child- hood. Ever and anon his eyes looked up, as a gay laugh or a witty repartee came to his ears; but he cared nothing for the gay scenes around him, and he early sought the solitude of his state-room, where he and James read long from their Bibles which his mother had been so kind as to furnish them; and then the twain knelt down in rever- ential devotion, and their prayers ascended to the throne of grace, that they might " be shielded from the temptations around them, the wicked brought to repentance, the war soon closed, and with as little sacrifice of life as possible, and that mother might be spared till their return." Their devotions ended, they arose, and after some general conversa- tion, they repaired to bed, to sleep off the fatigue of their toilsome journey, this being the second night since they left home, and without sleep, except little snatches they caught while cramped up in their narrow seats in the cars. They were, therefore,. very tired, and needed much the sleep which they thus early sought. The groaning of the steamer, and the cracking of her timbers, as she reeled from side to side, or came in contact with thicker pieces of ice, were sounds quite unfamiliar to Richard's ears; while the sounds of gayety and mirth in the cabin tended to keep alive his fancy, rather than to lull it to sleep. But as the hours wore tediously on, the voices and laughter became less numerous, as one by one, or in twos, the company betook them- selves to the retirement of their state-rooms, while silence and solitude reigned through the deserted cabin, and nothing was heard save the cracking of the steamer and the strokes of the paddles on the ice. She had stopped and backed up so many times that it ceased to at- tract any attention, and the passengers, more used to excitements of steamboat travel than Richard, were soon wrapped in profound and peaceful slumbers. The boat is stopped, backs up, and again plunges for- ward, making a few rods of progress into the thick and fast-forming ice. Again she stops, again backs, and again plunges ahead, less and less each time she essays her giant strength. She must not stand still, and to keep trying is the only resource; and as she gains less and less in the vast field of ice before her, now frozen three inches thick, and fast congealing, it becomes more and more evident that she is fast in the   76         LOVE ON THE WING.  ice, and in the middle of the Hudson River. What should be done? It would not do to stand there; she must moves if only backward; Captain, engineers, and men are busy and anxious, while hushed voicesj can be heard as the word of command passes from one to the other.  "It's no use trying, Captain; we can't go through," the engineer said, despairingly.  "But we must, we must," he emphatically responded. "We must go through, if we have to go ahead and cut the ice with axes. But try her again." "I'll try; but something will break, I believe," he replied, while a i shade of fear passed over his troubled face. "Let her break; we qan't stay here, for we have not provisions enough for all the passengers in the morning: we must go through or starve," he said, turning on his heel to hasten to another part of the boat, while  the engineer slowly, but reluctantly, backed out, the wheels almost re- fusing to revolve. They backed a quarter of a mile, and with all steam on, rushed into the chasm with great violence. There was a crash, and a sound of rushing water; then the whistle was sounded, and the alarm given. The passengers hear it, and all bound out into the cabin, not for a moment considering their unpresentable appearance, with their hair all dishevelled and falling on their white shoulders, and with their eyes staring wildly about them, their faces pale as death, as each anxiously inquired whether the damage was serious, and whether the boat would sink. Wives, mothers, and maidens each clung to her protector, or sought one among strangers, and grasping his arm, looked tearfully and inquiringly up into faces as comfortless as their own, but found no consolation in the affrighted look, nor assurance in the muttered, im-  patient response. All was confusion above, and all anxiety and fear below. The bow of the boat had been crushed in, and she was fast  filling with water. The pumps were set at work, as well as the car- penters; but all could not stay the in-rushing flood, while the boat was slowly sinking lower and lower. A plank was fitted between the ribs, and securely nailed, and the greatest part of the water thus held back. The pumps gained on the water in the hold, and she was safe, though wedged in the ice and unable to stir, as something about the machinery had broken. The morning found them there, a hundred miles from New York. The sun shone bright and clear upon the ridged ice, as cake' had been shoved upon cake at each of the struggles of this great boat, and there had frozen, leaving it sufficiently firm to support the weight of an iudi-   PROMOTION.             " vidual. A ladder was put down, and some twenty availed themselves of the privilege of footing it across to the Hudson River railroad; and as Richard and James did not like the prospect of remaining there, they too crossed on the ice, and again took the cars, which they had a few hours previously so gladly left, thinking to find a more agreeable,. if not more speedy means of transit. They arrived in New York in the evening without any further ac- cident; and after receiving back their steamboat passage money, they took the Washington train. They arrived in Washington the next morning, April 1, 1861. The enemy was marshalling his hosts for bat- tle, and making every preparation for a severe and vigorous campaign. Days rolled on, and the recruiting went on vigorously all over the United States, some for one side, and some for the other. In Wash- ington, as well as elsewhere, the people enrolled themselves for the deadly strife. Richard and James bought each a horse, and were duly enlisted in the service on the 19th of April, - that day being already memora- ble as the one on which the Massachusetts Sixth was assaulted on her way through Baltimore. They enlisted in the President's Mounted Guard as privates; and were to serve three months, - that time being all that would be required to extinguish the rebellion. After the expiration of Richard's term of service, and in the fall of the same year, he was placed upon the staff of General McClellan, and went with him the spring following to the Peninsula, and through that disastrous campaign without a scratch. CHAPTER XIII. OLD KI AND JIM.--THE WHSKEY AND       THE CABBAGE PLANTS. S the spring advanced, the work at Nestoria went on much the same as usual, requiring, however, the same amount of blowing and swearing as it formerly did. No one could plough but Mike English, and no one could drive a yoke of oxen and a span of horses but James Reiley; and these, after the usual bluster, were secured for the spring services. Jim, as he was familiarly called, had been reared with the family, and as he shared in its trials and sorrows, it is no more than right that Jae should partake of its glory; and a history of the former would 7* I   78         LOVE ON THE WING.       ,  be wholly incomplete without the latter. Jim was rather addicted to the intoxicating cup during all the,earlier years of his life; but, to his credit be it recorded, in the evening of his days he took the pledge, and : since then has stubbornly refused to touch, taste, or smell of the poi- sonous cup. The influence of this temperance society has been for the 1 good of its members, elevating many of them from the gutters to the respectable walks of life; and in Jim, more especially than any of the rest, could be observed a changed and more gentlemanly deportment; while his walk, though feeble from age, was more stately, and his dress more neat and becoming. But while old Ki lived, he must, as he always had, have his bitters in the morning, and at noon, and at night; and if at very hard or dis- agreeable work, such as washing sheep or shovelling the manure into the wagons, a jug of high wines was placed at his disposal. Sometimes even weeding carrots was deemed sufficiently irksome and tedious to require a little of the exhilarating influence to arouse the dormant fac- ulties ilto more vigorous activity. As the day was exceeding warm and sultry, old Ki, as he looked down from the veranda to the field, where they were at work under the hot June sun, took compassion on them, and, calling his boy, sent him with a jugful to them, thinking, no doubt, that he'would be more than repaid by the increased work which  would be performed. He called William, and inquired, " why he didn't send some down before. You ought to know that they can't weed carrots without some- thing to drink. Look there!" he said, pointing with his finger, "how do you suppose they can work bent over so, under this hot sun. Strange I can never teach you how to farm it." "I know it, they can't, of course no ;, but I forgot all about it until just now, and I was looking for the jug when you called me." "You lie; you wasn't, either. You needn't tell me, for I know better. You wasn't thinking anything about it at all; nor would you, if you hadn't been told. Now, you see after this that they have something to drink when they are weeding carrots." "Well," he replied, and was walking away. Here! hold on; I hain't through with you yet. I gad, now; whew!  what do you propose doing, by going down there so much lately? I suppose you think I don't know anything about it, eh, do you?I have  kept house, and run my own establishment, going on now these fifty years, and I think I shall be able some time to come to attend to my own business; but when I get so that I am not able, I'll call on you, and we'll hold a council on this subject; and in the mean time you   FORBIDDEN TO MARRY.          79 just keep away from that crazy-headed' fidgety girl. What do you suppose I want of her here? or do you propose to turn me out and take possession yourself? I'll give you to understand, though, that I don't mean to undress until I go to bed, and then you can do as you like; but while I remain here, I propose to run this place myself." "Why, of course you may," he slowly replied, his lips blanched with indignation. "I didn't propose to interfere with your plans at all; but I thought, as mother was getting old, that a little help would not be amiss; and, as Isaac is all the while blowing because I don't marry, I thought it would be right enough to take a wife." "Just let Ike blow, and attend to his business. I'll fix him so he won't trouble me. It's all right enough, if you have a place to put her,  but you bain't going to bring her here. One family in a house is enough. You needn't give yourself any uneasiness about your mother, for when she gets so that she ain't able to take care of the house, I'll get somebody to take care of both her and the house." "But it's too late now, for I am already engaged, and it's to take place about the middle of September." "It is, eh? Well, now, I guess not. I gad, now, you're a smart fellow. If anything takes place, you'll take a confounded jerking, now mind you that," he said, as he looked a quick, impatient glance at the crest-fallen William. "I guess it will rain before many days," he con- tinued, "and to-morrow morning I want you to get up bright and early, for I want to send Jim down to Syracuse after some cabbage-plants. I want the large, drumhead kind." "Why, you can get them over to the Long Bridge; there is nny quantity of them," William hastily replied, glad to turn the subject even to cabbige-plants. "No, there hain't; no, there hain't; them hain't the kind I want. I don't want to be fooled any more with them plants. I want some good cabbages -to set over by the frog pond, in that rich, mucky soil: I'll have a half an acre of them, and we'll see if I can't raise enough to go through." "Well, I'll get up early. and send him off by the first train. How many do you want?" he asked, pleasantly. "I want enough for a half an acre; let me see, about four thousand. He can get them for ten dollars. Here, give him the money," he said, handing him the money. "Now, mind and attend to it. We'll see if I can make a farmer of you;" and he turned to go away. "There, what's that? 'tain't noon yet. Well, you might as well go down and call them to dinner," he said, turning round, and calling to William.   80        LOVE ON THE WING. So William started off, and when he was down by the barn, yelled at the top of his voice, and then returned to the house after he had seen to some little matters at the horse-barn, such as preparing feed for the teams which were out, and looking around to see if all the morning chores had been properly done. He was washing outside by the kitchen door, when old Ki came out, and asked, " if he had called them." "Yes, sir; they are coming; they will be here shortly." Satisfied on that subject, he returned to the sitting-room, where he sat musing  on the various businesses in hand. One after another received his at-  tention; and after all the preliminaries had been arranged, each was  dismissed from further consideration until the time arrived for action; when it must be done just as he had pre-arranged. Dinner was ready and waiting, and no one had come but the team-  sters, who were at the pump washing. Ki came out, and not seeing all, i asked, " if Jim, Tom, Mike, and Bill, had come up yet?"       I "No, sir; but guess they are comin'," one of the teamsters replied.  "You guess they are. Well, here, you needn't be in quite so much hurry; for, I gad, you're always the first at the table, and the last to get up. If I hadn't half the land in town I wouldn't be able to raise enough to eat. Go down, and see if they are coming." So he went down, and found all four asleep among the carrots, and so drunk they could hardly walk to the house. They all asked that he would not tell old Ki they had been asleep; but the wind was blowing so hard they had not heard the call. He promised he would not tell, for he might some time want some such favor, and they would more readily grant his if he acceded to theirs; and he would have a good argument to remind them of their present condition. But old Ki had a way of finding out all these things, partially unknown to everybody else; so when he saw them coming along, walking straight and steady, he asked why they hadn't come before. The best talker of the party replied, "that they hadn't heard any call for dinner; but they started as soon as they heard dinner was ready." "You didn't hear any call, eh? Well, I gad, now, I'll see about that, I'll see about that; now you'll see if I don't. Go in and get  dinner," he said, and then hurried away to find William, whom he found making a whiskey sling. "I gad, now, I thought you called them men. You're a smart fellow. I wish I had some one I could de- pend upon'; but no, I've got to go and do everything myself, or else it ain't done. Next time you do what I tell you to do, or I'll jerk that shirt off from you. All you care about is to fill yourself with that fiery stuff, and then eat till you can hardly walk," he said, foaming with rage.   FIELD HANDS SCOLDED.           81 "I called them, and if they were not asleep, could not have failed hear- ing me, for I could hear others talking a good deal farther off than they were," he blandly replied, as he sipped his favorite cup. "I gad, now, that's the reason, they were asleep," he said, rising. and going out to the barn, where he waited for the first who should appear, when he would give him a going over. The teamsters came first, and each in his turn took a blowing about some trivial matter; either the horses were not properly cleaned, and he had neglected speak- ing of it until now; or if the collars were cleaned as they ought to be, their shoulders would not be so sore; or what did you let that tire run off for; or you broke that reach last spring carelessly, by turning around so short; and even recounting all the grievances that had occurred during their long acquaintance. Presently the recreant one came along, who had neglected telling him of the cause of the delay of the sleepers. t( Well, you're a smart fellow; why didn't you tell me they were asleep?I'm a good notion. to run you through with this pitchfork, you scoundrel, you villain," he yelled, grating his teeth, and advancing towards him in a menacing attitude. "I didn't want you to blow 'em, for I may get in some such scrape some time," he replied, tremblingly, lest he might hit him over the head with the fork, which was by this time reversed, and held threat- eningly, as if it was about to descend upon him. "You didn't want I should blow 'em. Well, I'll blow. you instead, and thrash you besides, if you ever play such a trick as this upon me again. Now you mark my word," he roared, loud enough to be heard half a mile away. The quarto coming out, and guessing what was up by the noise they heard, avoided coming too near, and were hastening towards the lot, which old Ki seeing, after he had concluded his remarks as above, has- tened out to intercept them. "Here, you scoundrels, you; come this way. Whew! what do you suppose I hired you for - to sleep?I'll show you that I want you to work. Say, John; go down and bring up that jug, and see if you can do it without getting drunk." "I, faith man, there's nary drop in it, for we fetched it up auselves to have it filled agin." "Agin! Yes, you'll have it filled agin, in a horn. You hain't going to sleep on my time, I'll give you to understand that. Here, William, bring that book out here.; I'll settle with these drunken fools right off, for I won't be bothered with such a drunken crew. I've been pestered to death with drunkards long enough." -They were soon paid off, and old Ki started them off, saying, "Don't   82         LOVE ON THE WING.  you ever show yourselves round here agin; if you do, I'll shoot every one of you. Start! why don't you?" the old man roared. "By my faith, sir, hain't you going to give us a drink afore we start? for you can't be so mane as that, to drive a feller away dry, I shouldn'tthink," Jim asked, laughingly,  "Well, here, give them a drink, give them a drink; and then clear out, and don't let me see you round here again; if I do, I'll set the dogs. '  on you," he said, still apparently as angry as ever. The old man was loath to see them go off; and as they were going out the gate, he called out to Jim to hold on a minute. "I gad, now, I want to send you down to Syracuse to-morrow after some cabbage-plants; do you sup- pose you can get them without getting drunk as a fpol again?" he asked, in a milder tone than he had used before that day. "To be sure, man, I can. I hain't drunk allus, you know," he re- )plied, rather pleased at this turn of the row. "Say, Tom," he continued,." you go and feed them hogs, and stir up that slop before you feed them."  "You go to blazes, will you! I'll never do another stitch for you as long as you have that ar bald pate on top your carcass." "Say! I gad, now; hold on, I'll give you another dollar a month. Come, now, go ahead and feed them hogs," he continued, coaxingly.  "You can't come that on this chicken -coax a feller with sugar, then give 'im soap. You hain't got no more brains in that ar pate of yourn than a prairie fowl. I allus thought I had wurked fur all the meanest men in town, but by the holy saints, you're the meanest of 'em all. I wurked fur aid Jance, Captin Buck, Huntsomer,- Dewiti- man, Jewman, Leeman, and finally fur you, the meanest of 'em all; and aly man after wurkin' fur such a crew has larned his trade well, an' is ready fur anything that may happen to turn up," he replied, quite sat- isfied that he had given him his just deserts, which none of the rest dared to do. he was half inclined to go and feed the hogs; and, if le would only tell him again, he would go. He made a motion that way, when old Ki, laughing heartily, said,- "That's right, go ahead; you won't get drunk again I guess." The other two waited impatiently for their orders, which they  hoped would be the same the others had received; and when old Ki told them to go on and finish weeding the carrots, they started;towards  the field without a murmur against the old man, except that he had mighty strange ways. Thus the day ended without any further incident of peculiar interest to any one; and thus nearly every day of old Ki's remarkable career    DRUNKEN MATT.             83 had been spent. He was generally blowing, or finding fault with some one, or he was making up for some old offence which he had before given, by such a servile fawning demeanor that it made one really sick to hear him, and as glad to get beyond the reach of his flattery, as he was before of his fury. When he was good, he was an angel; but when he was mad, he was a devil; and in these directly opposite extremes he delighted to live, either to praise to fulsome flattery, or to torment to the verge of distraction. Old Ki rose early on the following morning, not waiting for William to rout out Jim, and get him off to Syracuse. After breakfast he started with the ten dollars in his pocket, and, after having been called back twice by old Ki to inquire where he was going, and what he was going to do, and being satisfied that Jim knew what he was abbut, he at last let him go, though not without some misgivings as to the means em- ployed. Jim's eyes flashed with delight as he thought how rich he was, and how many good drinks ten dollars would buy. Old Jim was not, however, the only inebriate old Ki had upon his lands. There was another, and, if possible, worse than old Jim himself, and this was Mathew Wood, nephew of old Ki, commonly called, for short, Matt. He, like most other drinkers, had his days of sobriety, and during these was skilful, handy, and ingenious; consequently he made himself very useful at such times when he was of use to any one. But the holidays were his, and he must have his fun and his whiskey; and these days were often extended into weeks, and sometimes even into months; and not even then would he desist unless he had entered every tavern, grog-shop, and restaurant for miles around, and been re- fused a drink. He would go to farmers' houses, and by palavering with them, or their wives, or by flattering their daughters, succeed in getting them to draw a pitcher of. cider, when he would sit down and drink as moderately, and sip as gracefully, and converse as gallantly and wittily  as the most gentlemanly of men. To think him a confirmed drunkard would he preposterous, and a wrong not easily forgiven, if he was not positively known. .On the Fourth of July he must have a little inde- pendence, and Washington's birthday must be celebrated with respect- ful and becoming ceremonies. The birth of a child was a season of re- joicing, and for nearly every one of his children he had enjoyed the hospitalities of the county jail. The death of a relative was a sad event, and one could not mourn with becoming gravity unless in a state of unconsciousness; consequently some years were nearly, if not quite, half spent in drunken debaucheries. But to the cabbage-plants. The day came and went, and another,   84         LOVE ON THE WING.  then another, until the week was gone, and no tidings of either Jim or cabbage-plants. Old Ki was raving. He blew William for sending  such a miserable drunken fool after them: it was not enough to send whiskey into the lot, getting them so drunk they couldn't work, but he must send him down to Syracuse, with money, for cabbage-plants, which any one might know he would not get. "* You might have known  that he would get drunk and spend the money," he continued, with  emphasis; "and they wouldn't see anything of him for a month, or until the money was all gone, and then he'd have to come back, for no one would give him a minute's work, the miserable, good-for-nothing fool." "Why, I didn't know as I had anything to do about it," William said, blandly.. "Yes, you did, yes, you did, have all there was to be done-about it. I have got so now that I can't 'tend to my own business, but I must do just as you say. I gad, now, I'll give you to understand one of these days that I'm boss yet; and if you ain't mighty careful you'll get a club- bing again," he said, foaming with rage, and interspersing many profane expletives. The cabbage-plants were at last obtained from the Long Bridge, and which eventually proved as good as anybody had; but ten dollars were I gone, together with the services of a man a month; and yet, perhaps, it was a better investment than to have probqred the weak, sickly, hot-  house plants of Syracuse. CHAPTER XIV. CHARLIE AND SARAH. - WILL AND MARY. - SARAH AND FRIENDS. CHARLIE SPENCER called upon his affianced on his regular day, and was received with formal, nay, even freezing politeness. She  permitted him to take her hand, but drew back, as he was about to  encircle her neck in his arms, and imprint upon those ruby lips a   i lover's kiss. "Why, Sarah!"We exclaimed, "what have I done to offend you so? I was not aware that my darling affianced had received any occasion for this coldness. Tell me, do Sarah. Do not let me remain in suspense,    CHARLIE SPENCER DISMSSED.         85 such agonizing suspense, more dreadful than death itself. Was I sure that one word of mine had caused this, I would this instant cut out my tongue. Or if one act of mine had caused this estrangement, I'd lay my head upon the block, and let you blot out of life a being so ungrate- fuil as not to bow in meek and humble deference before so worthy and lovely a queen. Why delay? my lady, and let me hear my doom, and then go hang my cursed body upon a tree," he said, pleadingly. "Nay, call me not your lady. Hast thou forgotten your unprovoked and insulting slight? Think, and in thinking, remember that s]e who receives the love and homage of every heart, accepts the scorn of none. Dost remember?" and a doubtful smile curled her coquettish lips. "My most adored lady, I do not; and if I did, I'd rush from your presence this instant, and give my body to the fishes of yon silvery lake. But tell me! Why delay? Tell me whether I live beneath the sunshine of your radiant smiles, or die an unhonored death by your frown," he said, while a look of anguish and despair darkened his face. "Ha! how treacherous your memory is. I'll enlighten it, and when thou hast heard, betake yourself hence, and trouble me no more. You have no recollection of the time when last Ellen and I visited your folks, and when you came in you took my hand, and her you kissed?" she said, eying him askance. "Why! you surely do not remember that against me? That's when I was just recovering from a sickness which brought me nigh to the grave. I was delirious then, and hardly knew what I was about, and it was before our engagement. Ha, me! am I thus to be cut off?" he said, sighing with a sigh which came from the innermost recesses of his bleeding heart, while tears were streaming down his face. She had risen, and was slowly approaching the door, when he, hastily catching her dress, and on his bended knees implored her not to leave him thus: "Do not utterly forsake me, and cast me off forever. Think, recon- sider, and countermand my sentence, for it's more than I can bear. Overlook that little trifle, and let me live -live in the sunshine of thy love! If I die, my blood will' be on your hands, and you cannot wash them clean. Pity to stain those stainless hands with innocent and guileless blood, -blood, which if it did not course through my veins with warm and fervent love for you, I would gladly spill it out, and die. Accept my love, Sarah, thus making me supremely happy, and also yourself; for I pledge myself sincerely and devoutly to love and cherish to the end of my days, you, the only and worthy object my love has 8   86         LOVE ON THE WING. ever found. Believe me, for I speak the words of sincerity and truth.  My life without you would be as barren as the bleak deserts of Sahara. i And not one single oasis will there be in all the long weary journey of life if vour love be thus ruthlessly withdrawn. Try me once again, do, Sarah, and the motto of my life shall be, to love, protect, cherish, and  defend, while life to me is granted. My life with you will be bliss  indeed, while my life without you, O, do not think of it! do not turn tl me thus away. Can I hope? Yes! I see it in your face. Your lip smiles. You have relented. I knew you would, for your heart could not be so obdurate while your disposition is so kind, and your being so lovely. I'll kiss your hand in token of reciprocated love; there, 'tis sealed, and you are mine again, and I, happy." He arose, smiling, thinking truly he had won; but she opened the door, and vanished from his presence. He stood for a moment rigid as a statue; but his resolve was taken, and that was to find out the cause of this estrangement, and if it was caused by other than his own agencies, that agent should die and he with him. He stepped into the carriage, and drove home with a sad and heavy heart. How different were his feelings when last he passed along this road! Now he was cheerless and despondent, while a few hours before his soul was filled with the most joyful anticipations, for he would soon be with his  I affianced bride, the only, and the dearest object of his life. He thought, as he rode leisurely along, " how impossible it would be for him to withdraw his love, where it had been tendered and accepted, then spurned. Some one, surely, must be at the bottom of all this; and if there is, I'll find him out. But it's cowardly to despair while there are so many others. I won't. I'll hate her as much as I have loved her. I'll hate all her kindred, and friends, and curse the air she breathes, and the life she lives. So get along there, Dick; we'll live in this world yet a while, unless some fiend, like this woman (and he bit his lip at the word), doth stab us to the heart with a dagger." William met Isaac a few days after the one on which the cabbage plant affair occurred, and taking him by the button-hole, led him to a sequestered spot, and said,- "Pa don't very much like to have me marry quite yet, and thinks we can get along pretty well as we are. Perhaps it would be better to  give it up for the present."  "No, you don't give it up. Why, she is all but ready now. Her dress is made, and in a week, at the'furthest, she will be quite ready. You needn't be afraid of pa: I'll make it all right with him, for he can't raise many very serious objections. Have you bought your wedding suit?" he asked, knowing he had.   ISAAC COUNSELS WILLIAM     TO MARRY.      87 "Yes, but pa will not consent, and I would rather put it off till he thinks it best. Ma thinks she is smart enough to attend to the house; and as long as she is willing to work so hard, I would rather defer it for a while," he said, softly. "Yes, you're always for deferring everything, and never ready to plunge forward, and do that which you know you ought to do. I would like to see you have a little will of your own, and not defer so much to the selfish opinion of others. You never will amount to shucks if you don't have a little resolution of your own. Resolve what to do, and then do it, and not be always on the fence, doubting which way you had better go. Go at once, leaving the consequences to take care of themselves. It won't kill you to miarry; and as for the rest, why, there is room enough in the house for Sarah. Suppose pa and ma both die, what are you going to do then?" he asked, while a triumphant smile litup his face. "Well," said William, as he passed his hand over his eyes, across his nose, then down along his beard, " for my part I don't care, for I had as lief marry now as at any time; but I want the folks all satisfied, so there will be nothing to say when it is too late." "There won't be anythfng said, I'll warrant that, so you can just go ahead and finish the preparations; and when everything is all ready, we'll have the nuptials solemnized, privately if necessary, publicly if possible." Time sped along, as it always does, waiting for no one; whether they are marrying or giving in marriage, it is the same; and while some are preparing, with joyful hearts, to enter upon life's most important and eventful stage, - namely, the matrimonial stage, - others are going the way which all others must sooner or later follow, to that bourn whence no traveller returns; and it behooves us, if we look upon life aright, to cast an eye occasionally in that direction, even if we are engaged in the busiest and most eventful concerns of life. It was whispered around slyly, at first, that William was about to be married to the pretty sister of Isaac's wife, and that her bridal trousseau was nearly, if not quite, completed; while some of her most intimate friends called to see the beautiful dress,'and to congratulate her upon her happy prospects. Her star was certainly in the ascendant, and many hoped that no clouds would intervene to darken its lustre or ob- scure its brilliancy. The poor, unfortunate Mary was quite forgotten; but she did not forget, neither had she wholly forgiven, and none watched the progress of this match with more solicitude than Mary did; and as it became   88        LOVE ON THE WING. more and more evident that it was no fiction, the pain at her heart  kept gnawing deeper and deeper, until at last she was compelled to keep her room, and was even confined to her bed. A slow fever was gaining steadily upon her, which each day grew worse and worse, the result of which no one could tell. She was at times delirious, and the name of William was muttered faintly, with short snatches of inco- herent sentences ; but enough could be heard to tell the real cause of her j sickness, for every one knew the circumstances from beginning to end; and it was attributed to the cold indifference which William had mani- fested towards her, in selecting another to occupy a position which was by priority of right hers. She had murmured against the unkind decrees of Fate, but the rec- ollection of him could not easily be effaced from her heart; and it had been unconsciously gnawing away all those tender and endearing ties which bind one heart in the delicate tendrils of another, until all wish for life was gone. The world had all these long weary years been a cheerless blank to her, and she hoped that the light which fcired so faintly, would soon become extinguished forever. If William Could only come and give back to her the love he had torn away, shewould live, live for him whom she had vowed eternally to love, but for no other did she care to live. As soon as William heard she was dangerously ill, he came down to see her; and when she was told he was coming, her eyes brightened up, and looked as if death was trying to live. She tried hard to quiet the emotions of her heart, but the exertion was too much, and she relapsed again into a delirious condition, and became wild, talking, in low, muffled whispers of one whom she had loved, but who now was gone, gone past all hope of return, for another had taken him away. Her eyes were ghastly, her cheeks livid, while round her mouth there was a purple tinge, making her look as if her days were short and few. William came, and approached the bed with a noiseless tread, and, taking her thin, white hand in his, pressed it gently, and stooping over the unconscious form, whispered, "Mary, do you know me?I am William, come to see you." She turned her head at the sound of that familiar voice, and looked into his eyes a glance which sent a pang of remorse through his soul; and he shuddered as he thought how he had been instrumental in bringing this woman even to the brink of the grave. She didn't know him, nor any one; but he wished she would, even for a moment, that he might hear her forgiveness, which he silently asked might be granted. As he stood holding her white hand, cold drops of sweat oozed from his brow, and his bosom heaved with the emotion he vainly tried to suppress.   DEATH OF MARY.            89 Her eyes closed, and the long, silken lashes drooped heavily down on her marble-like face, while neither a motion nor a quiver was percepti- ble. He rubbed her hand in his warm palm, which he thought was clammy, and the ends of the fingers were a little cold. 'he relatives and friends of Mary, who were standing around, turned their faces as they saw the tears he had so long kept back swell out and run down his face and then drop upon the hand he was trying to warm in his- for Mary was dead. As soon as all were persuaded that Mary was really gone, William kneeled down by the bed and wept like a little child. It was pitiful indeed to see that strong man sob and cry so bitterly, say- ing, " O, Mary, Mary! why did you die?and without a single word, O, dear Mary!" William arose reluctantly, and as he looked down upon the unconscious sleeper, now cold in the embrace of death, his tears gushed forth anew; and covering his face with his handkerchief, without saying a word or hearing a word from any one, he slowly left the room, and sought some quiet place where he could cry out the grief which was struggling so hard in his great heart. He went to the barn, and there in solitude he wept for the Mary he once had loved so dearly, but now had lost - lost forever. It seemed as if his heart would break, so deep down it went. She had passed away so calmly, and without a word, even while he held her hand. If she had only spoken, and said, "William, I for- give all,", it would have been easier to bear it; but no, not a word. She went off, feeling she was being wronged, thinking that another, no more worthy than herself, was about to usurp the place in his heart where she had been so long. "No wonder it killed her. I ought to die myself, for I am not fit to live with the life of this innocent person on my hands. I have wronged her and wronged myself, far beyond all hope of forgiveness. 1 ought to go and .drown myself, or call upon the hills and mountains to fall upon me, and crush me dead - vile that I am, and unworthy the blessed boon of life; for that life I have disgraced or wronged, while death will not come to relieve me of that I am unworthy to keep." William arose and sadly entered the carriage, and drove home, sob- bing most piteously all the way. For many days he was inconsolable; and if any one jeered at him for mourning so much for one who was no relative, he received so sharp a rebuke that closed all further argument on the subject. It was a good excuse for putting off the wedding, for not one word of it would William hear. Isaac reminded him of it once, but he thought 8* fj *       f   90        LOVE ON THE WING. it would hardly be safe to try it again; so the wedding was, for the pres- ent, deferred. There was one who did not weep for Mary, and she could not see why William felt so bad about it; and there certainly was no reason why the wedding should be long put off, seeing they were all ready. She might have been, had she lived, a dangerous rival for Sarah; but now her way was clear, all obstacles were removed, and she had a smooth sea with a good wind, and fair sailing was in prospect. The dress was tried on, and it fitted admirably. It was a diaphanous white tulle, with purple ribbons, and a point lace collar. It became her well; and she looked like a spirit of the mist, as she swept gracefully before the large mirror, her coquettish eyes sparkling with joy; and her face was radiant with happy smiles, as she thought how soon she would be the happy bride of the long-sought and much-coveted William. "It can't be possible that he wishes to put it off entirely - can it " she asked, as Ellen came around and smoothed down some refractory . wrinkles in the dress. "No; I shouldn't think he would. If I were a man, the sooner I received such a prize the sooner I'd be satisfied. You can hardly ima- gine how exquisitely pretty you do look," she said, more narrowly scru- tinizing the fair complexion, the sunny hair, the sylph-like form, the queenly grace, with quick, blithe-like movement, all combined to ren- der Sarah, in her gorgeous bridal robes, as beautiful as it is possible for the imagination to picture. It was late in the summer when the subject was again broached to William, and this time he did not receive it with as much reluctance as before; and said, - "I suppose some time this fall will answer- say about the middle of October," and a sinister smile passed over his face. "What in the world can be the object of putting it off so long as that?" fsaac angrily asked. "O, it's only a mere matter of-time, sure to be brought about some day, so it can't possibly make much difference on what particular day," he soothingly replied. "Yes, it does make a good deal of difference; for you might put it off o in that way indefinitely, saying some other day will do as well. Put it off a little while longer!" he said, waxing warm at the thought of a fur- ther postponement. "  Yes; well, -but for my part, I don't care. Suit yourselves, for anything will please me. But I kinder thought that; taking all things into consideration, it would be well enough not to be too hasty," he said, slowly and diffidently.   WILLIAM  URGED TO MARRY.         91 "Yes- well - but you are the most consummate fool I ever came across; so- I was going to say thundering easy and indifferent to all the most important concerns of life. I do wish, by gad, that a little life and activity could be infused into your sluggish veins. I don't suppose you care a - picayune whether you live or not; do you " he asked, foaming with rage, all the while moving about the office, slamming back the chairs, and hitting the poor dog a kick because he happened to lie where he wished to put a chair. "O, yes, I do; I don't care about leaving this country yet a while, especially during this nice weather. What a delightful day it is out! We have that big meadow all cleared, and didn't get a drop of rain on the hay, either. I tell you what it is, it is nice hay," he said, smiling pleasantly, while his hand again passed over his face and then down along his beard. "I don't want to talk about hay, nor anything else, for it is enough to drive one crazy to hear such - I was going to say confounded inso- lence; but it's characteristic of the man, and no one can expect any- thing else but a growl from a dog. If it hadn't been for me you wouldn't have that horse. I wish now I'd let Ostrander had him: and you must come down and borrow my buggy, for you was so tight and stingy you couldn't buy one of your own to go to the funeral with. You can never have anything of your own, but you must always come to me, and this is the way I am repaid. If it hadn't been for me you wouldn't have ten cents left, for I must do all your figuring, and a good deal of your selling, because you make so many blunders that you can't trust your- self," he said, reviewing nearly all the past, in which William had been negligent or careless, or where a good opportunity had been allowed to pass without receiving what had been offered. But he didn't say a word about the double carriage and harness he had borrowed from William, the pole, and dashboard, and top of which had been all smashed in a runaway, when he was trying to make a great splurge with the new horse he had bought to match his iron-gray, the expense of repairing which he forgot to pay; nor did he say anything about the light, open wagon he had borrowed while his own was being fixed, and which he ran till it was worn out; nor did he say anything about that wide-tire lumber wagon which he used two whole years, while his own broken wagon was standing behind the barn, its broken axle sinking deeper and deeper into the mud; nor did he say anything about the double sleigh he wore out; nor about the cutter he is run- ning, while his own is standing in the barn with a broken runner. All these, and sundry other things, he didn't mention - no, not one word   92         LOVE ON THE WING. of them; neither did William remind him, as that would only have made matters worse. '  "Now, I tell you what it is; if you don't marry by the middle of Oc- tober, you needn't look to me for any more favors. Now you just re- member that, will you? I won't let you have that barn either, and you needn't send down again for any more of that damaged corn to feedto your half-starved stock, for I won't let another kernel of it go out of the mill; now mind it," he said, his anger not one whit abated. "Well, there is no use of letting it lay there and heat. But say, I'll come down one of these fine evenings, and talk the matter over," he said, relenting. i But come down to-night, for Ella Barker and, Susan Graham are here, Sarah's former schoolmates at Geneva. Come in and see them now," he said, more pleasantly, as he started towards the house, while William reluctantly followed. "There, he's coming in;" said Sarah, running into the sitting-room, where the company were seated, talking of the proposed nuptials and the flattering circumstances of the presumptive bridegroom. ", Say, let's invite him down this evening; we will have such a delightful time," she said, whisperingly, in an aside, to Mrs. Wood. "Well, do, my dear," Ellen replied, as the door opened and the broth- ers entered. "Miss Barker, Miss Graham, my brother," said Isaac, smiling benignly, as if he were the most amiable of all the men in the world. Each of the ladies arose, and courtesying politely, resumed her seat, while Sarah remained seated, watching with pleasure the easy off- hand style of her betrothed, who bowed himself gallantly into a chair. After the usual commonplace remarks, such as the weather, the ap- proaching thunder-shower, and the urgency of agricultural business at this season of the year, Miss Graham asked "You are engaged in se- curing your hay, I believe?" "Yes," said William, with one of his winning smiles. "' We havejust finished haying, and a nicer lot of hay we never gathered, and we have rushed things through on the double-quick so as not'to get be-hind. Our wheat harvest comes next, - let me see, there is about eighty acres, and I guess before it's all in there'll be some hard work, especially if  these sweltering days continue." Sarah blushed a little as she saw the mischievous twinkle in the young ladies' eyes. Miss Barker asked,-- ",Your father must be a very large farmer to have such a quantity of wheat to harvest; must he not?" "'Nearly as big as any of them, though he thinks it a, very small affair," he replied, not in the least abashed. i   WILLIAM  CATECHSED.         93 "How many acres are there, Mr. Wood?"Miss Graham asked. "Nearly eight hundred, I believe," he replied, counting them slowly on his fingers. "I should think he would find much difficulty in managing so large a farm," Miss Graham continued. "O, no, not the least. I think he rather likes the fun," he replied, glancing from her to Sarah. "I think it's beginning to wear upon him, though," Isaac said, as he glanced knowingly in the direction of Sarah. "What is the age of your father, Mr. Wood?"Miss Barker asked. "Let me see, seventy-one, I believe - yes, it is - ain't it, Ike?" "I believe so," Isaac replied. "He enjoys good health, does he not?"Miss Graham asked. "His general health is good, but he has an awful cancer on his face, 'which troubles him muchly," William responded. "O, what a pity! and a cancer is the most terrible of all our afflic- tions. Is it incurable?"Miss Barker-asked, sorrowfully. "We have had some hopes that it could be cured, and Mrs. Clark, his present doctress, thinks she will be able to make a final thing of it," William doubtfully replied. "I remember once hearing a doctor in Rochester, who said, in a lec- ture he delivered in that city, that he could effect a permanent cure if the patient applied to him in time," Miss Graham replied, as a painful shade passed quickly over her face. "I think the only way to cure one is to cut it out," Sarah playfully remarked, and the features of the young ladies assumed an agonized expression, and both exclaimed, " O, don't, Sarah!" "But why? Would it not be better to cut it out at once, than suf- fer through years the most acute pain?" she quickly asked. "Why, yes, if a cure was effected. But of such an instance I have never yet heard," Miss Barker said. Isaac arose and passed out, and William, bowing politely to the ladies, who also arose, followed, while Sarah, coming out into the hall, and taking William .by the arm, asked, "if he wouldn't come down that evening; I know you will enjoy it so much, they are so agreeable." "Why, certainly, certainly I'll come down - this evening, eh?" he asked, foppishy. ' Yes; come down this evening," she said. "Well, what do you think of him," Sarah asked, as she entered the room. "I think he is good enough; but he has so many slang phrases that   "        LOVE ON THE WING. the first few years of your life will be devoted to correcting many little mistakes which have incorporated themselves into his mind by moving so much in the society of the vulgar," Ella replied, in a friendly way. "Pshaw! I don't care for his slang phrases, if he only uses me well; that's all I want," she replied, indifferently. "Many of his rowdyish phrases will drop from his vocabulary by as- sociation in that refined circle into which you will introduce him, and your influence will tend much towards polishing his rou4b exterior, by holding up before his attention more refined manners, and better se- lected words, than he has been in the habit of hearing," Susan said, by way of encouragement. "I shan't trouble myself at all about his manners. I'm going to let him say and do just as he has a mind to." The tea-bell rang, and the party rose and went to supper. CHAPTER XV. WILL AND MATT. - RICHARD'S LETTER DELAYED. - MRS. BORDMAN COMES TO THE WEDDING. A   MONG the many who heard of Sarah's intended nuptials was A   another who did not rejoice, and that one was Charlie Spencer. He had expected something of this kind, but was not prepared for the startling intelligence that William was to be the fortunate possessor of such a prize. His unkind feelings towards her had been materially cooled by time; and while he regretted deeply his own unfortunate re- jection, he did not wish to think that she was not privileged to break an engagement which she thought might prove unhappy, or if she thought she might do better. He did not wish to deny any lady the rights which he possessed, and so dearly valued; but if she meant from the first to jilt him, then she was an acknowledged flirt; and un- worthy, not only of his love, but also of any honest man's. At first he planned some pretty harsh things against the destroyers of his peace, but better and more prudent counsels prevailed, and he resolved to let the subject drop, and wait for Providence or fate to deal with them according to their deserts. It would be weakness in him to endeavor to obtain any satisfaction which would atone for the slight he had received; therefore, the wisest course for him to pursue was to give her up entirely, and think no more about her.   DRUNKEN PHLOSOPHY.            95 There was another, who, though not so intimately connected with the characters playing this matrimonial game'as he might have been, still he was determined to have a handin it. This was Matt, who thought the event of sufficient consequence to be celebrated with becoming re- spect., Consequently he resolved to have a little fun on his own ac- count, and partly at the expense of William, whom he visited on the third day of his spree. "Come now, Will, seein' you're goin' to marry that purty gal, s'pos- in' you treat," Matt said, his tongue already pretty thick. "Well, Matt, by gad I will. What will you have - cider, brandy, or whiskey?"William asked, smilingly. "Wall, Will, I don't care; but you ought to be purty liberal on so mementos an occasin'; s'pose we take little brandy and sugar." "Wall, we'll have some shortly; just wait till I run out there and tell the boys the dew is off so that they can be cutting up some to- bacco. Sit down there, Matt; here, right here. I'll be back in a minit;" and away Will ran for the garden, intending to keep out of sight till Matt was gone. Matt sat down in the kitchen, and commenced talking with the girls. Hle said, - "So Will is goin' to'marry, ain't he? Wall, I s'pose it's 'bout time, fur I allus thought he'd get sick of livin' alone arter a while ; an' if I'd bin in 'is place, I'd got married long afore this, fur you see he is situated just right to injoy all the cumfurts of life, without takin' up any of the burdins, don't you see? You see, he can take his wife an' sit rite down, an' let some on e else do the drudgery. It allus seemed to me that a man wusen't a half a man unless he married, an' took some of the re- sponsibilities of life on hisself. Now, you see, if I wus in Will's place, do you know what I'd do? Fust and foremost, I'd do just what he's goin' to do, and which he ought to have done long afore. Wall, when 1 married I'd bring my wife hum, an' keep her here, and take all the fun as I went along. Now, you see, it is just this wise: he comes hum at night, tired and sleepy; he don't see no 'appy smile beetnin' on his wife's face, 'cause he hain't got none; nor does he hear the prattle of little voices welcomin' him hum. No, he don't see none of this; an' it allus did seem to me that a man, if he live single, must live a mizzable life, for you see agin, he loses all these little angelic cumfurts, an' if he lose these, what is life?It's nothin'. Now, you see, when I get hum to-night, the fust thing I see at the door is Samy, an' he wun't wait till I set down afore he's right on my knee, an' says, '0, pa-pa, I'm so glad you cum  hum.' Now, you see agin, when he cum hum,   96        LOVE ON THE WING.  he loses all these enderments. I tell you what it is, I'm very, very glad he is goin' to marry, and I cum now to wish him all the joy there is to be found, in wedded life, an' that is much, now I tell you. To be sure there are sum care, but they are all blessin's; they are blessin's that are showered down upon us from above, for gud and wise purposes, an' without um we could not very well git along. Say, Em, why don't you mary? Iwould, if I were in your place. A purty gal like you has no bisness bei' sin gle. By gad, I've talked so much I'm getting con- siderable dry. I wunder whare that feller is gone to. Say, Em, just run down an' draw a feller a pitcher of cider. Come, that a?ood gal." "I dare not; they would kill me, certain. Go out and see if you can't find Will,' she replied, vainly trying to smother a laugh. "There ain't no use lookin' fur Will; but, by dad, I'll stay here till he cums, any way. I'm so orful dry I can't speak the truth, nor hardly anythin' else. It's most noon, ain't it? What are you goin' to have good fur dinner, Em?" "O, some corn beef, and cabbage, and potatoes, and bread and but- ter, and for dessert, a rice pudding." "By dad, that's a whalil' dinner. I guess I'd better stay and have sum, fur I begin to feel a leetle hungry too; but if I only had a drink of cider, it would make the dinner relish so much better. By dad, I wunder if that feller is gone off entirely. I'll go out and see if I can find him." But William did not mean to be found; so, when he saw him coming towards the barn, he ran out the back way, and across the garden, then round to the house. Matt, however, was too much for him; and when he heard some one running across the barn floor, he retraced his steps, unobserved, to the house; and when William entered the kitchen, he met him face to face at the door. "Say, now, Will; by dad, you ought to treat once; just give me one drink, and I'll go hum." "Yes; I'll get it for you in just one minit. You stay here till I go down cellar and draw it," he said, trying to keep him back. "Well, by dad, if you don't give me a drink, I'll give you one;" so saying, and as quick as a flash, he grabbed the swill-pail from under the sink, full of dish-water, potato parings, onion skins, and grease, and tipped it, bottom side up, on his head; and as he did it, he made himself scarce right away. He asked him, however, before he was out of hearing, " if that was 'is weddin' suit. Too bad, wusen't it Will, to spile that good suit?" Poor Willwas too wet to run, and too mad to cry, consequently he had to grin and bear it the best he could.   WAITING FOR NEWS.      .     9 Since Richard's absence he had written regularly to his mother, and she awaited with tearful, motherly anxiety, each returning week, for an answer to her last; but since the fatal battle of Bull Run she had not received a letter, and she began to fear something had befallen her boy., She knew that his three months time would expire on or near that day; but whether he would be actively engaged in the battle she did not know, though in his last, he said he should be there if possible; but the D. C. volunteers had only enlisted on the condition that they should not be taken from the district, though some of them had, be- cause of the dull and weary discipline, to which they had impatiently submitted, gone out on short reconnoitring excursions; and many of the D. C. volunteers were thought hot sufficiently loyal to be. intrusted in important positions: consequently they were not thrust forward to the first lines, but remained around and near Washington, doing pa- trol, orderly, and garrison duty. She feared the worst, and looked only on the darkest side, as mothers always do; but during her darkest moods, Hope whispered that pos- sibly he was well. Many long, weary evenings, she spent absently gazing into the vacant chair by her side, thinking that even then he was lying in some sickening hospital, or by the side of some running brook, bathing his bleeding wounds, or worse than all, was stark, and cold, and dead upon the blood-stained field, with no other shelter than the starry heavens, no one near but rebel foes. It was sad, and lonely, and desolate there without him; without a kind and loving word, without a happy smile, without his presence by her side. The papers she scanned to see if his name were not there, among the wounded, among the prisoners, or even among the dead; but, no! not there. Many prayers went'up to the throne of grace, that He would spare her son, and send him back to her alive, if not well. She found consolation there, where alone it could be found, during these her darkest hours, and she always rose from her knees encour- aged with the hope that God would spare her son, and send him back to her, while a bright, spiritual radiance shone from her eyes, as if they had been dazzled by her near approach to the throne of the living God, who saw right into her heart and there was no guile, but perfect faith and trust in Him, " the Giver of every good and perfect gift." Days waned into weeks, and weeks into months, still no tidings of her son came to soothe her mind, anxious with fear, or heal her heart, broken for love of her son. Daily she went to the office when every mail arrived, hoping, believing a missive there, and as often returned  more incohsolable than before. , Surely a letter must come by te     I 9   98         LOVE ON THE WING. nekt mail," she thought, as homeward she wended her way, and this she thought every time she left the office without the letter she so much desired to see. If she was sure he was only well she would not care; but perhaps he was wounded, or in some rebel prison, where no moth- er's voice could reach him, or friendly hand minister to him. Itras trying; it was unnerving her, this suspense, this doubt; and unless news of his safety reached her soon, she would succumb to the influ- ence this anguish had upon her heart. Faith and hope were her only refuge, and these alone sustained her. At last the long-wished-for letter arrived; and O, how her heart throbbed with delight as she took it and hurried home, nor stopped to answer the questions of her neighbors, who were also waiting for letters from absent sons or relatives in the army! "But was it good or bad news she would read? She didn't know; she would, though, soon find out," she thought, as she hurried on, jos- tling against pedestrians, who could hardly get out of her way. She sat down by the window, cleaned hei spectacles, and then eagerly opened the crumpled and soiled envelope, and read as follows:-- "WASHNGTON, D. C., Oct. 3, i861. "MY DEAR MOTHER: "Why have you not written this long, long time? Are you sick, or what in the world can be the matter I have sent you four letters, and have received no answer. Since I have been at liberty - or since the expiration of my time - I have been to Wheeling, Va., and by being round much with Gen. McClellan, doing little orderly services, and by showing my recommendatory and discharge papers, have won his confidence, and been appointed an aid on his staff, with rank of captain. Congratulate me, mother, upon my accession to this important position. I am well, and happy. Pray for me. I am in haste, and fear this will not reach you. There will be no more fighting here till spring. James is here, and well. "Lovingly, your soldier son,   RICHARD." Tears were already falling upon that welcomed sheet, and after read- ing it over once, twice, three times, -yes, until she knew every word by heart, - she drew out her desk, in which she kept her paper and ink, and pens, and wrote him a long, loving letter, telling him " she had not received a line from him in three months, but she was very, very glad to hear he was alive and well, and had been so fortunate; and she prayed he would long retain the confidence of his superior officers." Much more she wrote, but we have not space here to reproduce it   COMPANY UNINVITED.           99 all; but inher closing remarks, she said, "I hope, my son, you will not forget, in the midst of battle against our country's foes, to read the Bible I gave you, and to lift your voice in humble, prayerful petition to God, that He would in mercy spare my son to return again to me and to let peace and amity soon prevail in the hearts of our misguided brothers, and bring them to a sense of their wrong, and to lay down their arms, and return again to the wings of the symbol of our coun- try's glory, and rest contented, unambitious. Farewell, my son, and may God hold you in His keeping, and return you again to me. 9  , "Your loving mother,        JANE LOVELL." She sealed and addressed it, and then hurried away with it to the post-office, hoping it would soon be on its way to her soldier son, whom she loved so much. She felt better then, and rested well that night, thinking her son well, and fortune had crowned him with military laurels. Mrs. Bordman, hearing of William's anticipated nuptials, though not through him, resolved to be present at the wedding uninvited; conse- quently, one week before the time set for the consummation of the nup- tials, her approach was heralded by a telegram to William that she was in Buffalo, and would be at the Junction by noon the following day. William was always glad to see his sister, and the doors of Nestoria were always open to receive either of them, nor were they closed on them so long as they wished to remain; but on the present occasion he was afraid she would, by her presence and influence, shake his weak resolve. But why? Was it not for the best interests of the family that William should marry?He thought so; but perhaps she might not. Who could tell? We will see. The house was brushed up, and her room prepared with the same anxious care as formerly, William himself going up, and after examin- ing every little thing, pronounced it "superb." His mother had re- ceived a slight shock of apoplexy, and it was with much difficulty that she ascended the stairs; the duty, therefore, of renovating the rooms above devolved principally upon Bridget, the hired girl. William told Isaac, on the receipt of the news, that Mariah, named after her mother, was coming, and would be here to-morrow. Isaac divined her business at once, and said, "By gad! I wonder who told her anything about it. What in thunder did you want to tell her for?I suppose you'll be, listening to her now, the miserable, selfish thing," he said, angrily. "For my part, I haven't lisped a word of it to a single living person, for I rather hoped, on the whole, to marry," he replied, blandly.   100        LOVE ON THE WING.  "Yes, you hoped a good deal. The game is blocked now, and there is no use of talking any more about it, unless you intend going on with it regardless of her wishes; if so, why then it's all well enough, and  her presence here will be as welcome as any other lady. Why didn't you come down last night, as you promised the ladies you would?" "There! I thought I had something to do; but for the life of me I couldn't think what it was. This is the first I've thought of it from that time until now. I wouldn't have missed coming down for the world," he replied, much embarrassed at his unaccountably poor memory. "Yes, you forgot in a horn. You didn't mean to come any of the time. I should think you would have a little regard for veracity, if not for your own sake, at least for others," he said, his eye's sparkling in the heat of his passion. "If I had thought, I certainly would have come; but, then, the wed- ding can go on all the same," he said, reassuringly. "There'll be no wedding now, unless she marries Charlie Spencer. I wish now that match hadn't been broken off. Don't anything go right nowadays. You're such a veritable liar that no one can put any de- pendence on you, for no one can believe a word you say. Do you really intend to go through life in this way?If you do, I wouldn't be afraid to stake half I'm worth that in twenty-five years you'll be a beggar. Of what use to a man is wealth, if he can't be respected in society?" he asked, sneeringly. "If a man has money he can buy respect, let his reputation be what it may. I'd rather have a million than the good opinion of any one. If I could choose to-day between money and reputation, I'd take money; for with it a man can gain the other, but with reputation can a man get money? A good reputation will keep a man poor all his days, and scorned at his death; but if he is tricky and smart, even if he has to lie a little, if he gets rich, and dies rich, why people regret and mourn him when he dies, even moistening the flowers they plant upon his grave with their tears," he replied, evidently pleased at the long speech he had made. "Yes; but we'll see how many tears will be shed on your grave, and who will shed them; and if any are shed, they will fall from the eyes of bastards, or of harlots, or of base, mean men. No true man or woman will ever respect such a man, now mark that. The world judges men by their every-day walk of life, and it rewards them with its confidence, or censures them with its frown. I'm giving you a gratuitous lesson, and I hope you will profit by it. You are young yet, and may, if you   FOOLISH CAUTION.           101 will amend, be an example worthy the imitation of all young men, and be looked up to and pointed out with pride. Wouldn't it be much more creditable for a man to be selected by mothers, with children growing up, to advise them to follow your example, to do as you do, to talk as you talk, and be a man in every respect like you? But if every one was like you, what a world we'd have, with every one lying as you do. What do you think of that?" he asked, as he slammed a refractory chair back into the corner, which, as luck would'have it, hap- pened to be in his way. "I think it's worth just about as much as that fly right under my foot," he said, mechanically, putting his foot down with a thump right where a fly was, but was not when the foot came down; "but, no, it flew away,--or as much as it would have been worth if it had staid there. It seems to me as if I had read somewhere, or somebody else read it to me, about a straw, or a mote, or something of that kind, being in a man's eye," he thoughtfully replied, rubbing his head where phrenolo- gists locate the bump of memory. "Just as I might have expected. No one expects anything but a kick from an ass; and even when the groom is trying to do something to'comfort or beautify him. But I'll wait on you patientlyfor a little while longer, though I hardly think I'll carry forbearance so far as to make it vice," he said, prudently, his anger much abated, for he did not want to come to a crisis then, on the eve of his contemplated marriage. He could afford to wait, and see what future developments would bring forth. Possibly he might be induced to marry; but he entertained very fee- ble hopes, though this was the first time he had been pressed so far; and with such a beautiful and accomplished lady as an intended bride, he didn't know but it might. go through. He had not been very atten- tive, it is true, nor evinced a lover's impetuous zeal; but this could be accounted for by his singular habits of thought, and by the shrewd, cau- tious manner in which he took hold of all the concerns of life. Everything he did must first be weighed in his scales, the work to be performed on one side of the balance, the money on the other. Here the shoe pinched. If he married Sarah, he married a penniless bride, and it was like giving the third of his wealth away. She could bring him nothing--nothing but her beauty and feminine attractions, and what were these? Was he not all in all as he was?What use then of further additions?He could wait and see what the future had in store, plucking the flowers as he moved on through life? avoiding all the thorns, and if a beautiful and wealthy lady should happen to cross 9*   102        LOVE ON THE WING. his path, why it would be an easy thing, if she desired it, to strike up a match; if not, he could live as he had done. The world was just as bright in the future as it had been in the past. Such were William's cogitations on his way home, after leaving his  irascible brother. He entertained no malice towards his brother for his unlicensed criticisms, but on the whole he rather liked it; for the manner in which they were pug forward, enabled him to see through the thin gauze which was wrapped round the motives, revealing the unsightly deformities of the heart; and while he kept his concealed  under the cloak of his slow and cautious reticence, he laughed at the  folly of those who, in fostering their own interest, betrayed themselves and lost their cause. CHAPTER XVI. A COUNCIL AT IKE'S. ABOUT three days after the scene recorded in the last part of the last chapter, there was what William facetiously termed a con- vention, or council, held at Isaac's residence, of the relatives and par- ticular friends of Sarah and Ellen. Sarah and Ellen are already known to the reader, as are also Miss Barker and Miss Graham, young lady friends, who had been invited as bride's-maids upon the fortunate occa- sion of Sarah's nuptials. There was also at this convention, -it is not necessary to cite my authority, - Mrs. Emma Wood, a very particular and intimate friend of Sarah, who is a very good and pretty lady, and whose husband is, perhaps, fourth cousin of Isaac; and then there is Mrs. Angelina Wood, sister-in-law of Emma, a vain, dressy lady, of agreeable manners and a pleasant address. And then there is another, a Miss Sophia Wood, cousin of Isaac, who had perhaps seen more hap- py summers than any of the others, either because she was older, or be- cause she had been more fortunate than her friends by having never married. She was a garrulous, good-natured, and withal a religious old maid, of whom the narrator gathered many very important items in this story, and for which he now returns his most grateful thanks. The ball was set rolling by the impetuous, headstrong, coquettish Sarah herself, who, with pouting lips and frowning eyes, said,-- "I wonder what that proud minx wanted to come down here for, just as I am about to step off into matrimonial pasture?"   "OVE AND HATE.           103 "I should think, if you entertained any doubts on the subject, you would say, as I was about to, &c.," Miss Graham archly said. "I can assure you, my dear girl, I entertained no such doubts, for I am not in the least afraid of all she can say or do;' nor would I be if 'there were half a dozen more just like her," she half-pleasantly, half- scornfully, replied. "Such easy, good-natured men are always more difficult to win than a right up and down man, one who loves with all the ardor of a great loving heart, and whose hatred is as bitter as his love is affectionate. Such a one, when you have secured him, he is yours; but, fie! I wouldn't bother my head about such a soft shell," Emma said, pettishy. "How about your hatred?"Ellen asked, shuddering. "O, indeed, a wife truly loved by such a nature, need never be afraid of hatred; for her he loves, while his enemies he hates," Emma replied, as a smile of satisfaction lit up her face. "Then love and hate can exist in the same place at the same time?" Miss Barker asked. Why, yes; why not?one directed towards a wife, and the other towards a foe," she replied, glancing pleasantly towards Miss Barker, who smilingly asked,-  "But how is it possible for two directly opposite passions to exist in one and the same thing at the same time? for where there is fire there is no water, and where there is water there can be no fire," and the smile looked triumphantly. "I hardly think it an applicable comparison; for though love may be warm and fervent, and even a blazing fire, does hate dampen or destroy it? Does it act upon it as water upon a burning fagot?" she re- turned. "No, but a cold, indifferent manner will even freeze that love right in its sacred fount." "Not in all cases; for I think I remember an instance wherein a faithful wife, after years of prayerful pleading and entreaty, reclaimed a recreant husband from his haunts of vicious dissipation, after he had abused, whipped, and even threatened her life, to her love, and that of his children," Emma said. "O, you read that in some novel. It will do for us to wish such things to be; and if such a thing occurs, we are willing to applaud and encourage, not only with our sympathy, but with a more material love, and-" "O, fiddlesticks! Don't let's have any more love in the abstract; let it be real, such as a lover bears towards his intended--mine, for in- stance," Sarah said, impatiently.   104        LOVE ON THE WING. "Deliver me from such love as that which he manifested in refusing to comply with the engagement he made the other day to come down and visit with us, for if he had no regard for his word-then, he would have none for it in more grave matters," Miss Graham said, scornfully. "O, he thinks it cunning and smart, that's all," Sarah rejoined, as if she would be willing to overlook greater offences than that to secure him. "And, indeed, if you ever marry a worthy gentleman, you will find that you will have to overlook a great many little things which you esteem so unpalatable now. You haven't tried your hand at love yet; but wait, we'll see. Of course, you may take some old codger without conceding much, to gratify a whim; but I would rather concede, than lower myself in the respect of my friends," she said, haughtily. "You speak of a gentleman, while I consider no man a gentleman who will purposely lie to a lady," she proudly retorted. "Well, for my part, I don't care; but I always did like William, and I've always entertained a hope that he would marry," said Ellen, glan- cing lovingly towards Sarah, " some worthy lady, who would correct many of his foppish, dandified notions, and lead him into paths of so- briety and truth; for he always manifested such a tender, filial love for his mother, that I am confident he cannot make a bad husband; at least, I would not be afraid to trust him, far and near, with a daughter of mine," said she, as she stroked lovingly the brown curls of her little rosy-faced girl, seated on a stool at her feet. "I never," she continued, "could bear to hear any thing said derogatory of William, for whom I've always entertained the most sanguine hopes. I may be selfish, but if I am, I can't help it, for it springs up spontaneously from my heart. He should marry, and make his home happy, and himself a name," she said, waxing eloquent in the defence of her cherished idol. "But say, Em, you've been through the mill, and know all about it. Will I need a handkerchief perfumed with hartshorn to keep me from fainting?" she asked sighing. "No, I think not; at least I didn't. A strong arm is a good support, and a strong faith in the future better still," she replied. "I've always had such a dread to approach the hymeneal font, that I feel all my strength and resolution giving away even at the thought," she said, sinking back dreamily into the chair. ; "It's the excitement that keeps one up, and the absolute necessity that it must be performed, if we would enjoy the comforts of life," she! an- swered, soothingly.   FEMNINE BANTER.           105 "It's one consolation that it won't last long; and that's why I hate the Episcopal forms so much, they are so tediously long; and to stand there and answer questions which he knows I've answered already, else I wouldn't be there, seems provokingly useless," she said, apparently much strengthened by Em's reassuring words. "Suppose you set out and reform the breviary, making the service shorter and less tiresome," Ellen smilingly interrupted. "I guess I'll wait now till after I'm married, then I'll have more leisure to attend to it," she quickly retorted. "She won't have much leisure, unless she attends to it pretty quick, for there will be something else that will claim her attention, undoubt- edly," Sophia carefully put in. "O, dear, that's always uppermost in your mind, for the only objection she can raise to a wedded life is the squalling brats. I wish you had about six to- take care of, the oldest about twelve," Sarah said, pet- tishy. O, well, you needn't be offended, for I'll warrant you'll have me tak- ing care of them in less than a year," she said, trying to remove the un- favorable impression her hasty remark had produced. "Them! and in less than a year, indeed!" she exclaimed, with scarcely an audible sigh. "My goodness, Sophia! you'd better take lessons n nursery, and not be telling quite so many stories to -. Let me see; what's his name  that young man who's dabbling in literature, and who, after getting a smattering of book-knowledge, takes it for granted he has acquired it 1 all. Strange I can't think of his name; why, Sarah, you know whom I mean," she asked, turning towards Sarah, who, smiling mischievously, was intently regarding Sophia's embarrassment. "Yes, hut it's no matter; he'll never amount to anything; but If he had married Sophia, instead of spending his time over those musty books, she might need a nurse, instead of engaging so long beforehand to attend upon me," Sarah said, archly. "Pshaw! he didn't think of marrying any of the time," she said, puckering up her lips at the thought of marrying such a fellow. Yes, but you did," Sarah retorted, teasingly. "I didn't either! I never cared that for him." she quickly responded, snapping her long bony finger in the air, and bowing knowingly, as if she had shipped a great many similar applicants before, who, perhaps, had gone down to untimely graves, while their dying curses were breathed against a frail and fickle woman, who neither knew their nature nor her own.   106        LOVE ON THE WING. "Then why did you correspond so long with him, if neither of you cared for the other?" she asked, wondering what she could say to that. "Why, I wonder if any one can't say or write a word to another un- less she is dead in love, and can find no other escape-valve than epistolary writing. I suppose you never wrote a word to a gentleman without having thoughts of marriage in your mind?" she asked, frown- ingly. "No, never. I don't know as I ever wrote a sincere love-letter in my life; but I've written a good many in fun, and always came out ahead," she said, smiling gayly. "As a matter of course, who ever knew of a woman's coming off vanquished? I never did," Miss Graham said. . "Where are you going, Sarah, on your wedding tour?"Angelina asked, with one of her sweetest smiles, which came so easy and unaf- fected that one would think it as natural as the rose is to the thorn; but smiles are sweeter, when they are rare.  "I don't know yet, for it isn't quite decided; -but he wishes to go, to Washington, while I'm anxious to go to Chicago, thence down to New Orleans. I want a ride on that terrible river, for I've heard so much about it, that to see it has been the ungratified wish of some years; and as he is so tractable and easy, I think I shall be able to carry my point, inasmuch as we can go thence to Washington, either by rail or water, if he wishes," she replied, languidly. I almost envy you the happiness of such a journey, for I've always longed to take a trip that way myself some time; perhaps it will be my wedding tour, who knows?"Miss Barker asked, as a smile lit up her face. "Maybe I can get him to let you accompany us.  If I could, wouldn't it be delightful?" she asked, her happy face dimpled all over with smiles. "O, no; mercy! don't speak of it; for on such occasions a man's heart is always more tender than at any other time, and I wouldn't be -so forward as to impose upon his good will," she said, her brow dark- ening. "O, you wouldn't be much of an expense; and I am sure he can afford that; and it would be so much more pleasant," she said. "O, you needn't be afraid; it will be pleasant enough, if no accidents happen, either on the railroad or steamboat," Em said. The. supper-bell rang, and the company repaired to the dining-room, where an ample board was spread. Ellen took the head, while Sarah   PRESENTIMENTS OF EVIL.          107 seated herself gracefully at the foot, and with becoming dignity poured the tea, handling the massive tea-urn and dainty cups with as much delicacy and grace as if she had long been accustomed to discharging the hospitalities of the house. But Sophie was more unfortunate in serving the plum sauce. The plate slipped from her fingers, and after sliding bottom side up on the white table-cloth, fell upon the skirts of her dress, leaving an ugly spot, which must be washed out before she resumed her supper. That little incident marred all the remaining pleasure of the visit, for her mind was continually on that spot on the skirts of her dress, and there her eyes involuntarily wandered whenever there was a lull in the conversation, or a dish had been sufficiently tasted. She was not happy, neither could she smile when anything remarkable was said or an anecdote told. She finally leaned gently back from the table; and as she waited impatiently for the rest of the company to finish, one by one, their mincing arid chit-chat, she sat mutely stroking the folds of her dress, occasionally casting ominous glances down towards the spot on her skirt; and when her eyes returned to a more composed and recon- ciled state, there was a frown upon her brow which she vainly tried to conceal. Finally, when all had moved back, one by one, and the nap- kins replaced upon the table, they all arose, and sauntered leisurely into the parlor, Emma encircling Sarah's form with her right arm, and Sarah's left under and around Emma's waist. Thus the twain reached the parlor, and standing before the mirror, surveyed the images reflected in smiling admiration. "I wish I could stand before the altar as composedly as I do now," Sarah said, carelessly. "Why, my child, what have you to fearP The ordeal will not kill you, neither has the future any terrors for you," Emma said, turning partially around, and looking admiringly down into the dreamy blue eyes, which rested so confidingly on her face. "It's the ordeal, not the future, which is bright with sunshine and flowers, without a cloud obscuring the one, or danger threatening the other; and if I were only in the Elysian fields beyond, I should be forever happy; but I have a vague, undefinable presentiment that that  ordeal will, with him, never- how painful is that cruel word!- be passed," and she leaned more heavily on the arm of her friend, who led her, half-fainting to the sofa. "Why, Sarah, I can't see why you should feel so. Cheer up, you frighten me! you look so like death. You will have a strong arm, and an assured future in prospect; for you'll have no baby-carts to draw,   108        LOVE ON THE WING. no dishes or clothes to wash, and Sophie for a nurse. Only think of it! There, I knew you'd laugh, although half-reluctant. There, now, brighten up, and think nothing, but hope," she said, caressing the  golden locks as they fell in wavy ringlets upon her bosom.  CHAPTER XVII.  MRS. BORDMAN ARRIVES, AND ALSO MATT. M  RS. BORDMAN, with her three children, had 'arrived, --a girl and two boys, aged respectively ten, seven, and three. As soon as the usual commonplace remarks had been exchanged, she relapsed in- to her usual quiet mood. She was at home, under her father's roof, where the ill will of her plotting foes could neither reach nor disturb her; for she was not insensible to the fact that her presence there was not at all desirable; but she kept her secrets, and pretended not to know what was in the hearts of her scheming relatives. She received them all friendly, and to all appearances sincerely, when they called upon her, inquiring after her health, her children, and their common welfare. To all such friendly greetings she responded with the air and dignity of one who knew her power, and who meant to exercise it. She was con- scious she had no rival, and if she had, she could talk him into silence. She was a gifted conversationalist, talking with an ease and fluency truly astonishing. In this lay the great secret of her-strength,. together with an open sincerity towards her friendly brother, and parents, and her own immediate family but to no one else did she ever disclose all the motives of her policy; neither did she even to these reveal at once, or spread out,as it were, in one view, all the motives and wishes of her heart; but she always told enough to those whom she wished to im- press with her reasons, to show that what she desiied was practicable and easy, and would in the end prove beneficial to all concerned. With Isaac, and Ellen, and Sarah, her arguments were futile, and fell upon their calloused minds like shot upon an iron-clad, which, glancing off, fell harmlessly at their feet; but with William and their parents her word was law; for she would allow them no rest until her request was granted, and they became heartsick at the ceaseless clatter of her tongue, granting what she asked, more to avoid her importunity, than for the inherent usefulness of the plan or scheme proposed. It   MRS. BORDMAN INVINCIBLE.          109 might be expensive or extravagant, but she carried the day by storm; and yet, strange to say, though nearly all her extravagant wishes were gratifie, the family, that is, her fatherrs family, flourished, and gathered in the harvests of their industry; and yet still more strange, she managed, by some hook or crook, to keep up outside friendly relations with those against whom she was plotting, and who in turn plotted against her, even while each held the other in silent scorn. How long they will continue--they are now more cold and distant than ever before - is of course more than I can predict. Isaac's party is now trying to force her to yield a point she cannot, with credit to herself, maintain, by refusing to 'exchange visits with her. In point of numbers Isaac is the strongest, and he, has also the good opinion and wishes of the people on his side, and yet she stands invulnerable, un- yielding, and alone. She turns a deaf ear to all the entreaties of friends, and rejects the threats of foes with scorn. The whispered words of scandal have reached her ears, and still she is deaf. She regards neither law nor the customs of society, and cares for nothing, save to win, and to gratify her own selfish ambition. The good name of her family she sees is being tarnished by the foul and loathsome hands of unchastity; still she looks calmly on, and permits it to go on unmolested. She sees the proud escutcheon of an ancient and esteemed family trailed low in the dust, without a word in rebuke, or an act in defence. How low art thou fallen, proud escutcheon! bearing the honored names of the respected dead, when thou hast descended to the keeping of' such degenerate, ungrateful children! -children who, instead of being united in harmony and love, in fostering and maintaining the pristine glory of the house, are at variance, each though with far different motives, struggling for the supremacy, - one for the good, the other to the detriment of the name. Mrs. Bordman was very proud and conceited, fawning and servile to her equals, supercilious and overbearing to her inferiors. She wished to outshine all others, and to do this required wealth. If hhe had it, she would squander it to excel; if she had it not, she could not acquire it; hence her wish to keep a well filled exchequer; yet, in spite of her most earnest endeavors, it was year by year becoming more and more depleted. Everything she 'did must be done on a large scale, and if any one went beyond it, she was mortified, and rather than see herself eclipsed, she would withdraw from the field, assigning some other reason for it. Her dresses were' of the richest fabric, and of the latest style. Her residence and its furniture must be the best and the most 10   "O        LOVE ON THE WING. costly; and if a new comer reared a more costly or more magnificent edifice, which she could not excel, she would sell out, and move where she could be first, and there abide until some one dared to go beyond. She would be first, but not last. Like Caesar, she would rather be first in a town than second in a city. She wanted, the good opinion of her fellow, if she could retain it and be first; if not, she would rather be first. Nothing can be said against her, if what I have already written be for her. Her selfish ambition is her greatest mistake; and even if she satisfied that, without loss of prestige, it was creditable, but if she lost her prestige, and gained her end, how was she bene- fited? The name is as necessary to a good constitution as all the members of the body are. Shall a person lose wlat is necessary to gain that which is not? A head is good on a good constitution, and without constitution, would be nothing. If I lose a leg to gain another head, how am I benefited? So with her. She lost what she most needed, to acquire what the did not need. I have been particular in describing this most remarkable lady, in order that the reader may follow the thread of this story understand- ingly, and in doing this, I have hinted at things which more properly come after; but it must be borne in mind that this is the first real at. tempt to coerce William into marriage, and this is the first stage-of it. His first love-dream, the unfortunate Mary, 'had no one to back her pretensions; and she, poor, innocent, and guileless girl, stood alone, battling against the whole, and she gave up at last, nor dreaming whence the influence came which restrained William from complying with his engagements; for she stood upon friendly and intimate terms with her who forbade her being the wife of him she so truly loved. The friends of Sarah, or those who play her cards, will, of course, be friendly on the start, in the hope of coaxing, by gentle means, that which should be freely granted without; but as time wears on, and the chances become less and less certain, more stringent measures are re- sorted to. The screw is turned lightly at first, for fear of paining; but gradually its tightening holds, nor does it yield the little gained; and as it sinks deeper and deeper into the vitals of the patient, inured to the pain, -who could not have borne at all at first, that which he now bears with ease, - is compelled at last, though reluctantly, to call a parley, and surrender. Thus the little game is played, and as we pro- gress we will unravel it, growing more and more interesting as we go, exposing to the gaze of all the world the crime and sin conceived and brought forth by sordid lust, and covered by the cloak of wealth. "So you did really intend to marry without inviting me, or even let-   WILLTAM  COERCED.          " ting me know it?" she asked, in a tone of mixed love, while looking him kindly in the face. "Why, no; I never intend to marry, unless you wish me to," he softly replied. "Then why so many preparations?She has her wedding dress, and I saw up stairs a splendid slit of clothes, a costly beaver, and a pair of patent leather boots," she said, eagerly, as a bitter-sweet smile curled her proud lip. "Those boots I've had now nearly a year, and that suit of clothes I obtained expressly to ride out with you in," he carelessly replied, smil- ing sweetly. "O, well, it isn't so bad as I supposed at first, for I was afraid that you did really intend to bring her here, and then there would be quar- relling between her and mother; for she is such a proud, disdainful thing that she would not submit to mother, and let her rule the house she has presided over so long and so faithfully. If I were in your place I would not marry while my parents lived, for I would show them that respect we have so long filially entertained towards them. I never could bear to see a young and inexperienced wife brought into a family to dispute with aged parents, and perhaps to deny them those little privileges which of right are theirs," she said, abstractedly, as she pierced with a crochet needle the slippers she was working for him. "I know it, and I've thought long on that very subject, wondering how any one could be so mean as to bring a wife into a family where a mother should reign supreme," he kindly replied, looking occasionally at his sister as he rolled a cigar in his mouth, and then watching the curling rings as they ascended, and finally vanished from sight. "There was a family in Quincy, - an aged, and highly esteemed family,-- who had an only son, rather wild, it's true, but who in one of his tantrums married, and brought to his father's roof a wife, with whom the mother was much displeased. This ill feeling was mutual; the young wife fostering hers until it grew into deadly hate, and everything she did and said was done to provoke more and more the old lady, in the hope of wearing her out, so she could take undisputed possession of the old homestead. In less than a year she succeeded, and the mother  was laid in the family vault by her undutiful children," she said, sadly;  and William groaned, and brushed away a tear which glistened upon the lashes of his eyes. "I suppose that is the way they wish to serve our mother," she con- tinued, watching with pleasure the effect her words had upon the soft  heart of her brother; " but you won'tlet them, will you?"she said, plead- ingly, throwing all the pathos of her love in the last two words.   "2        LOVE ON THE WING. "No, indeed, I will not. Mother shall live here, and enjoy all the comforts of home undisturbed so long as life lasts, and I wish that could be prolonged a hundred years," he said, mournfully. ", William! William! where are you? I wonder where that lazy fellow is," old Ki yelled, as he came running into the house, which, when William heard, he arose and met him as he was coming in the door. "By gad, now, can't you find anything else to do but to sit around the house," he said, almost out of breath. "Them cattle are in the corn; and the colts, you have them put into that corner lot; there is a high fence round that, and water. We'll have to drive them to water; but I'll keep them out of that corn if they choke. Come, why don't you start! or shall I have to go and do tltat, too?" he said, moving towards the door. "No; I was only waiting to hear what you had--to say;" he said, blandly, as he moved on. "You must have some very important business with him, to keep him here all the morning, when I was out round working and sweating like a butcher. I'll be glad when this marriage business is settled, for I'm sick of hearing it; as if there was nothing else to do but to harp continually upon that," he said, glancing pettishy at his daughter. "That is just what I've been trying to impress upon his mind. I told him there was enough to do on this great farm, without thinking of marriage," she said, smiling to think she had such a powerful aux- iliary on her side.  "What in the world do you care whether he marries or not?" "Why, so mother won't have any young rival to order her around; for nothing hurts me so much as to see an old lady set aside, her wishes disregarded, and her very presence a bore, by .a young upstart, dizzy with the unaccustomed authority thus suddenly thrust upon her," she said, hastily interrupting him, for she feared he would say something she did not wish to hear. "Why, I don't know; but I always thought that Miss - a very nice and amiable lady, and I think still she would be the last one to impose on her mother-in-law any restraints; but on the contrary, I think she would defer to her better judgment in everything pertaining to the government of the house," said Mrs. Bently, just coming down stairs, in. time to put in a word in defence of the rejected prospective bride. "O, dear. I can't see why you should take her part; for I heard her say, a year ago last spring, that she guessed you wouldn't hold your head up quite so high now, seeing you had lost your husband and a couple of millions," she replied, haughtily.   MRS BENTLEY'S HARANGUE.          113 "Did she say that?" she asked, in surprise. "She did say it, in my hearing," she answered, unhesitatingly. "The wretch! I wonder what she is? - her father a drunkard, and herself a beggar, without a home and penniless. She lives upon the charity of Isaac, too proud and lazy to help support herself. I'll never speak to her again, nor allow my children to exchange with her a word," she said, her eyes flashing fire, and her face blanched with the rage she could not conceal. "It ill becomes her to ridicule the unfortunate, and to throw into the teeth of a widowed mother a word of bitter scorn, while the remains of a loved husband and father are enshrouded for the tomb, and bowed down with the grief and loss she could not prevent; O, dear," she sighed, and wiping away the tears which were rolling in streams down her cheeks, and dampening the sombre folds of her drapery, she continued: "And to think I came so near being compelled to live under such authority, or seek a home elsewhere, sends a chill of horror through my veins," she said, and shook spasmodically, as if a chilly blast had blown upon her. "I wonder what would have become of her and her sister if Isaac had not taken compassion on the latter and married her, to save them both from becoming a burden to the town! I wonder if she would pout her lip, and turn up her nose, if she was compelled to work like an honest woman or starve; but no, she would rather put up with Isaac's abuse and ridicule than to take a man of her own position, and leave a place where she has not good sense enough to know she is not wanted. It was always so, and always will be. The scum of society, when ele- vated into position by some sudden freak of good fortune, becomes the most tyrannical of masters. The most servile and fawning in obscurity, in prosperity are the most intemperate; and such are always the ones to meet with some good luck, while a brave and worthy person would disdain to kneel and beg that which to merit should be granted with- out. They always make up in words what they lack in deeds, and look for promotion based upon, not their past conduct, but what that con- duct will be in the future; but the brave soldier stands upon his own vantage ground, and says, ' Give me the place on my own merits, on what you have known of me ;' while one less worthy gets it, because he fawned and flattered more, and relied upon fawning and flatteries to keep it. The brave soldier gives up in despair, and throwing away his musket, declares not another day will he fight for such a people," Mrs. Bentley said, eloquently, and waxing warm in her denunciation of such characters, while Mrs. Wood and Mrs. Bordman looked at one another 10    "4        LOVE ON TIlE WING. in mute astonishment, wondering that such remarkable words should come from one so weak. "I say, Will, by Joe! I didn't knock that hide off your nose when I threw that pail over your head, did I?By gad, I'm sorry. But, come; let's take a drink on't, and make up," said Matt, as he came reeling up from a two weeks' drunken debauch. "What, ain't you sobered up yet! You hadn't better come too near, or you may get your nose barked," he said, half smiling, as Matt play- fully sheered off, as if he was afraid. Let me see. You're going to marry--to marry, eh? I should think you'd invite a feller, Will, or else give him a smasher of old rye. Come, 'tain't likely you'll marry but oncet, an' you'll never have a better time to show how much you think of her and me," he said, coax- ingly; and Will was half inclined to get him a drink, but the memory of the swill-pail, and his clothes, ruined past all hope of repairing, re- strained him. "Well, Matt, I've about made up my mind I wouldn't marry just now, it's going to cost so much, and I can't very well afford the ex- pense, seeing you have spoiled one suit of clothes for me," he said, re- gretfully. "By gad, I'm sorry about that for your sake, not for hers, for she can get along somehow. But, come; let's go up and have a drink be- cause you ain't going to marry; it'll taste purty good, even on that, though not quite so good as if it were on a marry." "Ah! you'd better go home and sober up, for I want you to fix that hog-pen in a day or two. We're going to take up them hogs and com- mence fattening them," he said, turning off in the direction of Matt's house. "Here! that ain't the way. There's nothing to drink down there. Come back here, or by Joe! I won't fix your pen in a month." "Come down here, I want to show you about this fence, which I'm going to move over there for a lane," he said, pointing with his finger towards the barn, to which, from a pasture, it was intended to make a lane. "I don't care for your fences nor lanes, but I'm going to have a drink somewhere." By this time they were so far apart that nothing further was said.   IKE AND WILL ON MATRIMONY.         115 CHAPTER XVIII. IKE AND WILL ON MATRIMONY. -IKE, AND ELLEN, AND SARAH HOLD A COUNCIL. - OLD KI GIVES THE GIRLS THE HORSES. "W  ELL, what does she say?I suppose she forbids the marriage, don't she?"Isaac asked of William, a few days after the scene above recorded took place. "Not that I knowof; or at least I have heard nothing to that ef- fect," William coolly responded. "Now, what in thunder do you want to lie for?I suppose you think I'm as much of an ass as you are, and have not the least suspicion as to her business in coming down? I know just as well as if I had heard that she has been talking to you against it," he said, angrily. ' Well, if you know all about it, what do you ask me for?You won't take my word to the contrary, so you might just as well have kept still," William tartly replied. It was not often that he replied thus; only when pressed too closely, like the hunted rat did he turn at bay. Isaac thought a moment in silence, and then said,  "The time may come when she, as well as you, will regret this. For my part, I've said and done about all I shall; but remember, if you come to ruin, that I forewarned you in time. You hold your destiny in your own hands, and now take the consequences on yourself." "I've always done that, and I expect to, unless I choose a guar- dian, or have one chosen for me," he said. "You won't wait very long, if I should judge from the way you are going now. I don't think you are competent to attend to your business even now," he said, biting his lip. "I wish there hadn't been anything said about it, for it will be a town talk now, and we the butt of every- body's jest. It's bad enough for a lady to jilt a man, but for a man to jilt a lady is worse. So we may consider the engagement broken, I suppose." "O, no, not broken; but, as I said before, I think it would be well enough to defer it for a short time. It's only a mere matter of time," he replied, more pleasantly. "Do you suppose she is going to wait on your convenience, putting this off from time to time, with no settled, fixed determination that it shall take place? If you do, you are much mistaken, now I tell you," he asked, in a loud voicer   "6        LOVE ON THE WING. "If she is impatient, and thinks she can do better, why, of course, I've nothing to say. The country is as free to her as it is to me. All I ask is time; for this is a momentous business, and should not be en- tered into rashy, and without due consideration. When I am ready to marry, I should be happy to meet Miss -, and have it done with as soon as possible," he slowly said, and bowed knowingly, when a word was left to be inferred. "By all the stars! it's enough to make a Christian swear, to hear-such a consummate ass. I will swear, though I know it's-wicked; but it will relieve my mind of a burden I can't otherwise remove. But I won't, for it won't do any good, and I shall bring upon myself reproachful thoughts, if not future damnation," he said, rising up, and shoving back his chair with a vigorous kick, sent the back of it against a window, breaking out two panes of glass. It was evening of the same day that Isaac sat in the house with his family; usually, however, he spent his evenings either in the office, or in some bar-room, cracking loo, or playing euchre for the drinks; but on this occasion he graciously condescended to visit his family. "Well, what did he say about the wedding; has he given it up, or what?"Sarah asked, as Isaac was seating himself by the table, with newspaper in hand, preparatory to an evening's read. "O, I wish you wouldn't bother me any more about weddings, for I've heard nothing else for the last year, and I'm sick of it," he said, petulantly, at the same time he turned his head, and glanced at her a withering, scornful look. Thus rebuked, Sarah repaired to a corner, where Francia, her niece, was. undressing a doll, which she was going to put to bed, - her friends having returned home the day before. "Well, Francia, how long do you suppose it will be before youll be undressing a real doll? If you have such luck as I'm having, I'm pretty sure it will be some years yet." I don't mean to have such luck; for in the first place, I shall not set my figures quite so high as you have; in the second place, I shall not try to get the best, nor the meanest man in town. About half way between would please me better than either of the two.' Isaac smiled behind his paper, but said nothing, for it was not time yet, as Ellen had not yet joined the circle. Sarah looked on abstract- edly a few moments, and finally said, with a sigh,-- "I guess I'd better begin over again, and mark out a little different path." "It's too late now. Yots ought to have married Charlie, for you won't find any more Charlie Spencer's in the new path you will mark   SARAH INDEPENDENT.           117 out; because all of tnat class will think that if he was not good enough, there will be no use of their trying." "Pshaw, girl! you are crazy. I can marry before to-morrow night, if I'm a mind to," she said, tossing her head disdainfully; and rising, went to the table. "You say you can, but you won't. I'll bet I'll be married now as soon as you."  "Yes, if you take up the first old codger who comes along." "You needn't be afraid, for that kind will never trouble me." Ellen had by this time finished her chores, setting the bread on a chair behind the stove, with a table cloth over it being one, and get- ting out the children's night-gowns, and hanging them on a chair by the stove being another; and then she turned down the bed covering, and shook the pillows up afresh, while now she was looking for her thimble., which some of the children must have taken from the basket, for it wasn't there; finally she borrowed Sarah's, as no one seemed disposed to tell anything about it. "You seem to be more than usually interested with that paper, for I never saw you read so long before in the house. Well, there! he's reading the advertisements. I should think they would be very inter- esting," Ellen said, glancing over his shoulder. "A man might as well try to read in bedlam as to read here, fdr I don't know a single thing I have read of to night," he said, throwing the paper down, and removing the glasses from his nose. "What does he say about William?"Ellen asked, looking up at Sarah, who sat silently, drumming piano-fashion upon the table. "He won't say anything," she answered, pouting. "I can tell you, in just one word, the substance of all he said, and that is ' deferred," he said, looking at both. "Deferred! well, I'll defer him. I'll sue him for breach of promise," Sarah said, spitefully. "O, no, I wouldn't do that; for that would look as if you were will- ing to compromise it with money," Ellen said, deprecatingly. "Well, so I am, and I'll take ten thousand, and he may go to - I won't say where - anywhere he's a mind to; and with that in hand, I can marry or not, as I choose," she said, pouting her cherry lips. "It always looked to me as very objectionable and unbecoming a lady to bring herself thus before a jury, asking damages for a rejected love; and for my part, if I never mnarrid, I would keep and nourish my heart, thus cruelly thrust back upon me," Ellen said, regretfully. "But what if he had wronged you,- as some have been,- passed   "8         LOVE ON THE WING. beyond all hope of forgiveness, and you alone and unaided in the world, what would you do then?"Sarah asked. "We may thank our stars that this case is not analogous, and there is no use borrowing trouble on that score, for it's bad enough as it is. When such a case-as that occurs, is is well enough to meet it as the subject demands," Ellen replied, sternly. "If I could make the laws, I would have one to hang such villains,". Sarah said, emphatically. "' It would serve them right; and if all such were hung, how much better the few left would be," Ellen said, more pleasantly. "The few!"Isaac said, looking up astonished. "Yes, the few; for there would be but very few left, if all had their deserts," Ellen replied, tartly. "You are uncharitable, I think, madam, towards us; for if one sin, all should not be punished; for ' the few' you approve might, if the actual facts were known, be increased 'to the many,'" he said, in one of his gracious, though rare, pleasant moods. "'Yes, you would bail them all if you could, I suppose, for you are notoriously the weakest man towards criminals, and the most unjust and inconsistent towards the good, of any one I ever knew," she said, decidedly. "O, my dear, you misconstrue my philanthrophy; for in my humble opinion, and I guess it is as good as most other polemics, it is not the punishment, per se, but rather the fear of it, which prevents cime; con- sequently, when a crime is committed, perhaps through some mitigatory circumstances, maybe unknown to others, I don't see why he, when he asks, and promises to behave better in the future, should not be for- given, since he cannot expect the same indulgence for a second offence," he said, affectedly learned. "Yes, but another, hoping to escape like his fortunate predecessor, commits the same crime, thus making the, law a nullity, and leaving the suffering people unprotected," she said, with a sigh. "You only look on the dark side of the picture; for such always have their associates, or a ring, or clique, in which they move, and each, however insignificant, has an influence, as each little drop of water moves particles as large as itself, though imperceptible, even in the waters of the great deep; and he, who was thus convicted,-that is, the one before released, influencing the remainder, tended more to restrain them from committing like offences, than his simple punishment could possibly have none; and the aid he received might, as it often does, reclaim him from his vicious haunts, and make him a useful and re- -  . I   OLD KI FULFILS HS PROMSE.        119 spectable member of society.. I trust I have explained it intelligibly," he said, looking philosophically. "Yes, I'm convinced, though not persuaded; but as I am not very well versed in legal or metaphysical economy, you will, of course, ex- cuse the obtuseness of my comprehension, and - " "Pshaw! let's go to bed, for I'd rather have one good night's sleep than a yearof such talk," said Sarah, interrupting; and rising from her seat, proceeded to her room. As she entered her boudoir, she cast an eager, wistfulglance at her bridal trousseau, which ere now should have decked her a happy wife; "but no, not yet, deferred," she thought, and she brushed away a little tear, which, in spite of her resolution, forced itself from her eye. She slept but little, and in feverish snatches, dreaming often that dear Will was there; and once she wound her arms around his neck and kissed him, in a happy, though not refresh- ing confidence, to find, much to her regret, that it was a delusive fancy. Old Ki had not forgotten his promise to Flora, and of course Helen must not be slighted, so he had caused to be procured the accoutre- ments for two horses; and these, without the knowledge of the girls, were placed upon two of his colts, and led around to the front piazza, where the girls were sitting with their grandpa, who appeared to be taken by surprise when he saw the two pretty colts, as they came pran- cing along, all caparisoned for a ride. They had been broken expressly for the girls, and with great care, as they were comparatively unused to horses, though they had both ridden astride and bareback some of the old and more gentle horses, from the pasture to the barn; but to ride side- wise, and on a saddle, this they had never done; neither had they dared to touch, or come near horses of such fiery mettle, and as soon as they came in sight round the corner, both the girls sprang up in girlish glee, and clapping their hands, exclaimed, - "O, grandpa! look! what pretty horses! they are delightful. I wish I had such a horse," Flora said. "And so do I," Helen chimed in. "I wonder whose they can be? Grandpa, do buy that black horse, with that beautiful arching neck, he is so splendid. No, I guess I like that other one the best. What color is that, gray? Noi it's a kind of dapple- gray: he's the prettiest. Do say something, grandpa. What does it mean?  Has some one come to sell them, or what? I should like to know so much; I'll go down and ask one of those boys," she said, starting off. "Here, here, come back here, or you may get kicked!" old Ki at last exclaimed, who had all the while sat smiling very pleasantly, as he watched the effect the colts produced upon the pure and simple minds   120         LOVE ON THE WING. of his children. His smile was pleasant, except when the pain of the cutting cancer, which had broken out afresh, writhed it into agony; but he bore it all with great fortitude and resignation and when we think how much he suffered, and of how few of the comforts of life he par- took, we can hardly wish to change places with him, even for the great wealth he possessed. "Well, how do you like them?" he asked, as he put his hand up to his face, to rub down the sharp pain that had just then darted through it, making his eyes cringe, and his head to droop one side. O, I think they are splendid; and if I could only have one of them to ride, it would be so nice," Flora said, as she stood petting one more tame than the other, which had by this time come upo the piazza where they were sitting,  6"You may have one of them," he said. "O, may I, grandpa? You are so good!" she exclaimed, running up and putting her arms around the old man's neck, kissed the side of his face not afflicted by the cancer, while he put his hand up to the sore to guard it from the loving embrace. "And may I have the other one, grandpa?"Helen asked, running. up and stroking the neck and mane of the dapple-gray. "Yes, take your choice," he replied, between two spasmodic twitches of his face. ", you are so kind, and I thank you ever so much," she said, tak- ing the bridle in her little hand, and leading him to the horse-block, where, with some assistance from her uncle, who had just arrived upon the scene, she was seated upon the saddle. The horse, finding so light a burden upon his back, seemed refractory at first, but she jerked stead- ily on the reins, anid being accustomed to yield when such a demonstra- tion was made, succumbed to a gentle speed. Flora was likewise seated in the saddle of her jet black pony, and was soon following at a risky speed the dashing Helen, who, with her jet black and waving tresses flying in the wind, looked like a fairy, fleeing joyfully from an impetuous and accepted lover, while. Flora, less gay but more lovable, had her hair securely tied up. They rode up and down before the house a few times, each time waving adieus and kisses to the assembled household on the piazza, who in turn waved their handkerchiefs in great joyousness at the in- nocent sport of the young girls. Their dresses were short, and ex- posed their little ankles, which they often and vainly tried to cover. But they soon reined up before the piazza and received the congratu- lations of all, while their cheeks were aglow from the violent and unu-    DEATH OF OLD KI.           121 sual exercise they had undergone. They dismounted, and the horses were led back, while their mother assured them they should have a riding-habit in a week or so. Little Julia, daughter of Mrs. Bordman, now ten years of age, cried impetuously because she could not ride, and William, to gratify her, went and brought back the horses; and as both of the sisters were too tired to ride again, he mounted one, while Julia sat awkwardly upon the other. She managed to keep on the saddle, and after riding up and down a few times, reined, up, receiving the same applause the sisters re- ceived. Old Ki told them all that he had given the horses to the girls, to keep and do with them whatever they wished; but he would keep them for the girls on the farm as long as they desired, and if they wanted to give them up when they were tired of them they might, but there was to be no constraint used. He felt his end drawing near, and he was already making preparations to die; and this was why he was so particular in telling about the horses. But, alas! if he had been as particular in more important matters, and less so in these little ones, it would have been far better for those whom he wished to serve. CHAPTER XIX. DEATH OF THE OLD MAN. SINCE the establishment of the soldier's post-office, letters to and from them came and went much more punctually than before, and without that great loss of mail which before was so prevalent. Mrs. Lovell received letters weekly from her son, to which the writer is indebted for much of value in connecting the links of this interesting story. She regularly attended church, and was a fervent and devout Christian; and few of the congregation were more punctual at Friday afternoon meetings than Mrs. Lovell, who was often observed, as she arose from her seat to go away, wiping the tear-drop from her face, gathered there from the fervency of her silent prayers, and those of the beloved pastor and Christian friends. It was at a time, too, when the prayers of the nation were needed, as well as patriotism, to encourage and sustain our brave defenders in the field of carnage and blood; for while many were willing to sacrifice comfort, and even life itself, some, unused to the hardships of a mili- "   122        LOVE ON THE WING.                ' tary life, were falling off, or shirking the more onerous duties of the  soldier. While Mrs. Lovell was willing her son should serve the cause of their country, both loved so dearly, she prayed and hoped that he  would not only serve it faithfully, but also return home to her bosom  again. She would far rather see him die honorably upon the battle- field than sully his name by cowardice and desertion, as she had already heard that some had done. But Richard knew well his duties, and would perform them, and his dear mother need entertain no fears for  him; for while he lived, his mother and friends should never have cause  to blush when the name of Richard Lovell was mentioned; for though  his laurels might be dimmed by the dust and tarnage of the strife, they  should never be tarnished by an act unbecoming a, soldier, or by a  J thought unbecoming a man. He marched with the general up the Peninsula, over the graves of the half-buried dead, to the vicinity of Richmond, and then retreated through the Black Oak Swamp-that disastrous six days' fight; and when the general was superseded, Richard was again at liberty. But he could not be idle, and he again, through the influence of General McClellan, obtained an important and lucrative position, which he filled with credit till the summer of '63, when, on coming home, and finding his services so much needed, and so amply rewarded, he resolved to remain, at least for a short time. Old Ki's health was fast declining, and-it became evident to all that his career was about to close. So when he heard of Richard's arrival home, he sent for him, and desired so much his services, that he de- cided to stay, and take a part in the gathering of a large crop of tobacco. The acrimonious feeling of the old man had, by time, and the dis- missal of the young lady who carried to and from him reports at va- riance with his interests, been allayed; and now, as Richard was will- ing to forget the past, he would, and they became fast and firm friends, which ended only in death. William, too, felt a little bitterness against Richard for causing, in part, the rejection of her for whom he may have entertained more es- teem than was consistent with their near relationship; but this was all forgotten, and he extended to Richard the friendship of his heart, to be severed only by conflicting interests many years hence, which it is the province of the story to unfold- He was very anxious, seeing the state of affairs in prospect, to have Richard stay, and put up for a while at the house, as his counsels and friendly assistance would be very accept- able in the silent and lonely hours of night. Richard, seeing that his presence was not absolutely needed at home (for his, mother had   "AST SCENE.            123 learned from experience how to gather in the cabbages, and turnips, and potatoes while he was in the army), resolved to remain with William, and endeavor to discharge the duties which fell upon him. It was a cold and dreary day in November of '63, when the falling leaf was mingled with the freezing rain as it fell upon the soft and un- frozen sod, making the crust slippery and unsafe to tread; when the wind sighed mournfully through the partially unsheltered boughs, as if the funeral note was already being sung; when the distant howling of the sleepless watch-dog added tenfold to the dreariness and deso- lation of the scene; when the muffled roar of the waters over the mill- dam seemed more than usually solemn in the expectation of coming death, that relatives and friends were summoned to the bedside of the dying father. Mrs. Bordman and husband arrived in time to receive a father's blessing; but shortly afterwards he became unconscious, and thus passed away, without a quiver of the muscles of the face, disfigured by a fearful cancer. Isaac was there; and, after going most too frequently to the cubby- hole in the chimney where the decanter was kept, came, and, after the fashion of the Roman emperors, pronounced the following eulogy over his father:  "I never cared to see the corpse of any one, unless it was my father. See what a broad and massive chest, with large, giant frame," he said, pointing with his finger towards the chest, and then spread out both his hands, as he measured the length of the inanimate remains. "H could take two ordinary men and hold them still, or jerk them as he wished," he continued, taking hold of the collar of a little attenuated doctor, and nearly throwing him upon the deceased. Richard was there., and helped others lay him out, performing with a delicate tenderness the duties we owe to one another, and with a sad and chastened spirit. When the members of the family gathered round to look upon the face of him they loved and feared in life, so calm and still in death, they wept; and as they stood there, in the presence of one who a few moments before was with them, now gone, they thought how near they were standing to those portals which sep- arate life from death, and still how impossible it was to draw aside the veil and peep beyond. One of their number was already there, having but a moment before stepped across, and was now soaring to those realms where all have in fancy been, and shudderingly returned; but never again can the disembodied soul return and re-occupy the old tenement as of old, when once it has departed, unless some other power, unknown to physical laws, is brought to bear.   124        LOVE ON THE WING.  But it was the saddest of all to see the aged and helpless mother,  now stricken by two paralytic strokes, depriving her of speech and sense i as well as motion, as she was rolled along in her wheel-chair; and  i when she came so she could see the cold features of him with whom she had lived for over half a century she cried; at sight of which, the  tears of the children gushed forth anew; and they all did weep, and mingle their tears together, for the lose of him they could not bring back. It was not untimely nor sudden, for all had been long expect- ant, and he had lived more than threescore and ten; but even then they were loath to part, and would have mourned him as bitterly had his life been still further prolonged. But who, when Death comes, and knocks upon ourdoors, are willing to open and let him in? Even though we believe we are going to a sunnier clime, we like'this the best, and long to stay. But go we must; for Death must do his errand, and tals us away, no matter how reluctant. We go, protesting against his violence in dragging us away from happy homes, and from children requiring our aid, and precept, and example. To this he turns a deaf ear, and bears us on, nor heeding our sighs and lamentations at the un- kind decrees of Fate for bringing us into the world to please a while, and then tear us away again.  Many were the friends who came from miles around to pay their last respects to the dead, whom he had by charitable deeds and kind words befriended. Numberless are the ways and means in which we can mani- fest a brotherly regard for our fellow. A position difficult to acquire can, by one kind word, which costs nothing, be obtained. A dollar given to an orphan will melt his heart to tenderness, which was, perhaps, re- turned twofold, and which, if it had not, would never have been missed from hoarded pile. A bushel of wheat to a widow, who, not expecting, with tears of thankfulness receives, and prays for blessings upon the giver. A small note due, which the maker, after selling the fatted calf and the wheat he had reserved for seed, is surprised when he comes to pay, to see the paper torn before his eyes and destroyed. "It's paid, and it's all right, so keep the money to pay your taxes with," the old man says. With a thankful hearthe leaves him, praying all the while he may live a hundred or more years; and at home he tells the joyful  news to his wife and family, and they in turn tell the neighbors, and they all rejoice, and say, "He is a good man, after all. We thought he  was so harsh and strange that one could not approach him, if ever in  his life he did a thing, of which he was ashamed. His scathing,  slashing tongue was the worst that could be said about him; and this, now still in death, was all forgotten, while the memory of his good :  deeds shines bright and dimless through years of time.   THE FUNERAL.            125 The long line of carriages, bearing the rich and the poor, and the lame and the halt, and the blind, as they wound along through the nar- row dell and over the hill, and across the brook, testified how dearly he was beloved; for never before in the little and quiet village was there so large a funeral. From the house, in all directions, a procession moved away, that with the hearse being little, though ript much, the longest. For a mile ot more it reached, so that when the last came up to assist at the burial, the work was all performed; and the flowers they had brought to throw in the grave, were left in the cold and frost, to freeze and die on top. Thus the good man was buried, while the children and parents returned to their home, to await the hour when they, too, will lay down and die, never dreaming that the days that intervene, when they are spent, are nothing. A burial scene affects the sensibilities of youth the most, for all the sighs and sounds they treasure up in their memory. The sound of wheels grating through the ruts, or jolting on the stones, sends a chill- ing sensation through the heart as the thought recurs to the memory in after life. The sound of the tolling-bell, as in measured strokes it strikes the solemn dirge; the low muffled sound, as it echoes among the hills, and through the valleys, and along the streams, mingling its sound with the falling waters, as they dash and foam on the rocks be- neath, awaken memories which the grief-stricken conscience tries in vain to smother. The cawing of crows, as they waft their dusky pinions in the bleak air, or from bough to bough in the adjoining wood, refreshes impres- sible minds of the sorrows they once experienced in the past years of childhood. The hum of industry, the sounds of gayety and mirth of those not stricken down by grief, who in turn will soon, if they have not already felt the scourging influence of the hand of death as it snatches a beloved child from a mother's tender care, or strikes down amidst a successful career a father, or brother, or friend; all are made, sooner or later, to mourn the loss of dear loved ones, whose counsels, and pro- tection, and love most were needed, or whose care had grown to seem more a blessing than a burden. None felt the loss more deeply, or mourned more sorrowfully, than did Flora; for her tender heart, not yet healed by the loss of her father, opened afresh the gaping wounds, and they bled at every pore. She wept, too, aA before, and as few young girls weep, with tears fall- ing down her face; but it was a silent, unutterable woe, which went deep down in her tender heart, and there sobbed and moaned till all its delicate tendrils seemed to snap asunder. If tears could have flown, "   126        LOVE ON THE WING.                ! they would have quenched the raging fires within; but no, the chan- nels were obstructed by an indomitable and an unconquerable will, which prevented all egress of the walled-up and fast-increasing flood, threatening at times to break over all the barriers, and overflow. Grief sanctifies the soul, and permits a nearer approach to immortal and im- perishable essences, making those who mourn, if they mourn with a sincere and contrite heart, purer and more free from the evil thoughts of the world; but these, by time, in some natures, soon wear away, allowing the thoughts to assume their wonted channel; but on the heart of Flora they left a deep and lasting impression, which continued through the eventful years of her life; for the curious observer could see that beneath the calm, quiet, unassuming demeanor, there flowed a stream of sadness, undisturbed by the daily routine of ordinary life.  But with Helen the case was different. She wept tears of actual sor- row at the time, and perhaps she was morose and sad for days, maybe a week; but when she had, mourned enough, she threw the pall from her heart, and was as gay and lively as if nothing unusual had-occurred. She believed in living and enjoying life as she went along, undisturbed  by unavoidable accidents, and meeting all the reverses of life with an air of recklessness bordering on levity. She mingled in all the pursuits of her girlish life as freely and unrestrainedly as before, only dampened  by Flora's short rebukes, "who," she thought, "would entertain more respect for the dead than to forget him so soon who had been so kind to them." But she was silenced by Helen's quick reply. "I don't believe in wearing all the time the habiliments of the grave. Life was made to live in, and death to die in; while in one, let us enjoy it, and when the other comes, let us fear it." Thus rebuffed, Flora would turn away, sighing, muttering, "Poor girl! poor sister! how much I pity her!" Old Ki intended to add a codicil to his will, made some years pre- viously, in behalf of the young orphans; but insensibility coming on sooner than he expected, and which, -perhaps, was purposely delayed by those interested, it was omitted, and the care of the widow and her children consigned to the hands of Isaac and William. He spoke of them before he died, and thought something should be done; but to-  t morrow some thought would do as well, and he might then feel better.  The morrows came and went, and each succeeding day made it more and more evident that another morrow and it would be too late; and   thus the poor, helpless orphans were left alone to look for a home to  one whom they loved, but whose easy nature an evil-minded person  could control, and control it, too, much to their disadvantage. This t /   MSCHEF-MAKING.           127 person had, no doubt, been provoked to this by words uttered against her; still they were words of truth, and as such should have been heeded. Isaac's sister-in-law had made use of language unbecoming a lady, and of a relative, who, bowed down by grief for her loss and the misfortune she had sustained, was the last in the world towards whom such words should have been used. These Mrs. Bentley could never forgive, as she, by the other, could not be forgiven. She was left in the lurch, without means and almost without friends. She scorned the hospital- ity of Isaac, and would neither visit there, nor permit her daughters to. It was not a hard task to get Flora to promise she would never like Sarah, because of her relationship with one whom she loathed, namely, Isaac, for she observed that he was very attentive to her mother at the funeral; and when she attended the funeral of a poor neighbor, he gal- lantly held an umbrella over the head of the widowed mother, as she walked from the house to the carriage. The act was good; but the look he cast over his shoulder towards those standing round betrayed the motives of his heart. He sought an approving sign, and wished to have it said of him that he had done a meritorious thing. Helen loved Ellen, she was so kind and gentle; bdt Sarah was so proud and vain, and cast such ominous and unfriendly looks at her, because of her poverty and homeliness, she hated, and would not look in the direction of her presence for fear of meeting that ugly look of defiant scorn. They all met on the day of the funeral; but the grasp of the hand was so cold, and the look so sad and reproving, that Ellen attributed it more to the sorrows she felt for the loss of him who had befriended her, than to any ill feelings towards herself. Sarah didn't care a fig about it, and she didn't trouble herself to make any inquiries into the state of Mrs. Bentley's mind. She thought that affliction, if not actual necessity, would soften any resentment she might feel to- wards them, if indeed it was resentment. Mrs. Bentley had been instilling into the minds of her children, un- wisely, it would seem, for one in her necessitous condition, feelings of resentment towards them; and the memory of the cruel taunt she had heard so rankled in her bosom, she could not suppress nor hide the feelings of displeasure which rose up in her mind; though she put on the outward semblance of a sorrowful yet not a revengeful nature, and received them all with a cordiality hardly consistent with one who had received such an affront. The mourning party had most all departed to their several homes; but Mrs. Bordman, living at a distance, was not expected to leave for a week or two, as there was some business to be done which required   128        LOVE ON THE WING.                 L her presence there. She was to receive her legacy within a year, but the boys could, and perhaps would as lief pay it now as at any future time; so it was soon afterwards arranged that she should receive hers before returning home, while the remainder of the legatees must wait till the expiration of the time allowed them by law.   CHAPTER XX. MRS. BENTLEY AND MRS. BORD*AN HOLD COUNCIL. M  RS. BENTLEY had, during her residence under her father's roof, received many unfavorable impressions of his nurse, and now, seeing no necessity of her presence longer in the house, she urged upon Mrs. Bordman the impropriety of leaving her in the care of their mother; and this remark through some inadvertence, came to the ears of Bridget, who, greatly irritated, endeavored to drive the whole family from the  place, and take absolute and undisputed possession of the whole; but  her star, although ascending, was still obscured by the murky atmos-  phere surrounding the place, which for a time was dispelled, to be again resumed by her own indiscretions. Mrs. Bentley had repeatedly been closeted with her father on the subject, who, after hearing her com- plaints and assenting to their truthfulness, but demurred to her expul- sion, on the ground that she willingly did for him that which no one else would perform; and as her father's fast declining health required the continued presence of some. one to care for his many and sometimes t disagreeable wants, she thought she would not press the subject further, but wait for the development of events which ought, in all conscience, to dispense with the presence of one who reflected more shame 'than  credit upon the name and place. She was unwilling her children should be blighted by the presence of one so lost to every redeeming virtue; and for this, if for no other reason, she now broached the subject to Mrs.  Bordman, in the hope that their united influence would be sufficient to cause her dismissal from a home where her presence was more shameful than creditable, As this scion of the Green Isle is to play no very insignificant part in this story, we deem it not inopportune to illustrate a few of her physi- cal, as well as moral characteristics. Bridget O'Conor was or is of me- dium height, and thick set, and rather inclined to embonpoint; her eyes   DESCRIPTION   OF BRIDGET.        129 of a grayish blue, large, and overshadowed by a receding forehead; her hair brown, and of a soft, silky texture; her nose flat at the base, and pointed, when her head was erect,. towards the stars; her-mouth pro- jected far beyond the other portions of the face, or rather the upper jaw did, on which the nose seemed to rest, while the under jaw was set back, the lip covering it could with difficulty be brought up to meet the upper, and which she did sometimes, making the face look a little mon- keyfied. When the face was in repose, it was not ill looking; but when she affected, it was rather repulsive. Her manners were coarse and outlandish; her style was disagree- ably stiff, not graceful, nor dignified, nor refined, she not having received any of that culture which prepares a lady to shine in any circle of life; for her associates had always been of that low and unrefined class, who never advance beyond the dingy hut in which they are born. Her disposition was of the quick, irascible kind, and her tongue the only resource for the redress of her wrongs;, and this, it must be con- fessed, she did in a manner consistent with the low station she filled, for there were no words, however profane, that she would not employ, and none, however ndecent and vulgar, she would not use. The whole vocabulary of evil thoughts was committed to memory by the frequent use she made of them, and she used them on all occasions when aroused, no matter to whom, nor where the parties happened to be; for she thought it a mere pastime and a pleasure, as well as creditable to her. She con- sidered herself imposed upon and abused if she could not resent every affront or slight, which might purposely or accidentally happen; a word spoken against her aroused all the latent furies of her wrath, and which she poured forth upon the head of the audacious monster in a manner that sent terror to his heart and fleetness to his feet, if he was of the timid kind; but if he stood and showed battle, using the weapons she employed, wielding them dexterously, she collapsed, leav- ing the victor on the field. Such she always in future avoided; but he was a mean, good-for-nothing scamp, who could never hope to be re- ceived into favor, unless he made due acknowledgment for the awful offence comnitted; neither could any favor be granted by the venera- ble, gray-headed lord, unless he did it at his peril, and a martyrdom was in store for him. She often found her match, and some, indeed, whom she could neither reach with her poisonous tongue, nor contaminate with her vicious influence; and many an unquiet night she passed in , devising ways and means to bring some refractory and unmanageable person within the coils of her vengeance. In some instances she suc- ceeded, more though to her shame than to her glory, and in some   130 130        LOVE ON THE WING.                  ' j she did not. This was the virago with whom Mrs. Bentley and Mrs.  Bordman had to deal. We will see how they succeeded. It was a few days after the funeral of the father that the subject was  brought up and discussed.  "I think," Mrs. Bentley said, "that it would be well, before you re- turn, to assist in the removal of this bad girl from the house, for I do  think she is wholly unfit to have theciare-of-our mother, who is so help-  less, both in mind and body."                      i "Well, I have thought of it, and I will endeavor to have her ex- changed for a better girl," Mrs. Bordman replied, as she cast an omi- nous glance towards the kitchen door. "I overheard the other day, as I came unexpectedly upon her, and stopped at the half-opened door, such language, both foul, vulgar, and  profane, that my heart fairly stood still, and my hair rose up on end; and mother, poor woman! - how I pitied her! - sat laughing like a little child, at words which made me shudder," she said, shivering. "Yes, I know, for I've heard as much myself; but William is so soft-hearted that I fear all attempts will be futile," she replied, despond-  ingly.                                 i "They must not; she must be got rid of; for what would the people  say if they heard we had such a vile person here, contaminating our  children with her vicious, demoralizing influence? Why, we should have i the name of harboring the worst wretch, I believe, who ever lived," she : said, emphatically.                            "I know; we'll try and see what can be done. But, you know, im-  possibles are impossibles, and if it can't be done, we'll have to submit to it, for what can't be cured must be endured," she said.       i "O, my dear sister, I wish you wouldn't talk so, for it does seem as i if we could if we would get rid of her. I have thought if William  would only marry -but then he won't; so there is no use of saying  anything about that," she said, hastily, omitting the sentence she had Ad begun when she saw a frown gathering upon the brow of her sister.    i "Marry, marry! indeed, he'll never marry if forty just such terma- gants have to stay here!" she said, sneering at the word marry, as if it was some dreadful thing.  "But you surely will not refuse to lend your help in trying to get her away," she asked, pleadingly.              -  "No, I'll not refuse; but, as I said before, I've no hope of success;  for pity, with love, are two very strong feelings in William's heart, and it is very difficult to get him to think on such a subject as others do. 'His love is so broad and general that there is no resentment in it, what-    CONSPIRACY.            131 ever may be the defects of either character or disposition," she replied, gently. "Well, let us try; for we can't more than fail, and possibly we may succeed. Our united endeavors may do much towards convincing his mind of her utter unfitness for the position of a bachelor's housekeeper, and at this stage it behooves him to secure the one he intends to keeD; but the thought of keeping such a thing as this, is too preposterous even for a moment's consideration, and I do hope you will not entertain one; for my part, I would rather see any one else in the world here, as it would be hard, nay, impossible to find another such a wretch in the world. A negro woman would be far preferable," she said, with a tone of sadness in her voice. "We will talk with William as soon as he comes in, and see what he intends doing; for my part, I begin to feel as if we ought to get some- -body else, and that she is not hardly the right person in the right place," she said. "That's right; I'm glad to hear you talk so; for I begin to feel as if my cause, and the cause of right, was being upheld when I can enlist such good support on my side; and I think the time will come when you will be gratefully thankful to me for having pressed so far the question as to get your cooperation in the furtherance of a cause so eminently just," she said, hopefully. "I've thought just so all the while, but I've been doubtful of the end; for I never like to undertake a thing unless I carry it through, as failure is not a very pleasant refuge, and it might keave us in a rather disagreeable position. But then there can bedi;  danger," she said, reasoningly. But the girl they had been talking about stood at the door, and heard every word of the conversation between the sisters; so when William came around, she was the first to take him one side, and with tears streaming down her face, complain how she had been used by his sisters. He assured her, with many bland words, "that his sisters had not said a word to him about purchasing the place, and until they had, he thought he might be able to stay here. There was no use of crying, as that would not help the matter one iota; he would attend to it, and he was sorry they should speak in that way of her; they wouldn't, he was sure, if they knew her as well as he did. He would go right in and see if they were gQing to take immediate possession." Such language usually dried up her tears; and it was no wonder, for with his bland an4 easy way he would: oqtflnk minds full as strong as   132        LOVE ON THE WING.  hers. This was his greatest weapon, and his next best was his great patience and forbearance; and these, used together by a skilful hand, were very formidable. - When he was a little angry, his face was flushed, but when he was very angry, his mouth was circled round with an ashen hue; and as soon as he came into the presence of his sisters, they discovered at once that he was either angry at them, or somebody else. He,  unlike his father, never censured others for any remissness or faults which were not their own; but from a critical eye he could not con- , ceal his displeasure, and his sisters were as observing of these shades as any one, perhaps more so, for they had long lived with him,' and therefore had greater opportunities for learning the mysteries of his nature; so when he found the heat mantling on his face, he put his hand up to rub it down, thus for a time concealing the crimson glow, if not entirely removing it; any way, he felt more at ease, and met with greater indifference the first shock of an expected storm, if he thought no one was observing his agitation, or divined the cause of his embar- rassment. There are many whom he in this iay outwitted; for while he was anxious to do certain tiings, he always contrived to make some agent propose it, and by his indifference make him think he did not care  anything about it; though he always said enough to keep his courage up, so he would not forsake the project altogether. By manoeuvring in this way he kept everything in a state of abeyance, and he was at liberty to take either side at a moment's warning, as the circumstances might warrant. It is strange that any one could get along at all in such a way, but he does; how long he will, and be successful, remains for us  to see.                                 i When he entered the sitting-room one hand was upon his face, and  he seemed to be trying to rub something off, which persisted in staying  there.  "Why, what is the matter William? You seem agitated at something. Has that Irish thing been telling you anything? I wouldn't wonder if she had been listening to all we've been talking of," she said, nodding her head in the direction of Mrs. Bentley. "I've heard no news this morning, what is it? I should like to know," he replied, evasively. "The same as usual. I had hoped that our bereavement would tone down that rather objectionable feature. But no; the hills and moun- tains change, but you, your ways are past finding out," Mrs. Bord- man-said pleasantly, looking lovingly upon the features of her brother, now changed to a smile by her covert faittery.  *.* '  '  " ' ' s i !   CHARGES PREFERRED.           133 "You have all the start of me, for I have not the least idea to what you refer. I shall be much pleased, however, if there is anything worth hearing, to hear it; and as I'm in some hurry this morning, 1 can't visit with you as long as I might wish. I'll be at leisure this evening, and we'll have a long visit. You do not, I hope, intend to return this week," he said, more in the hope of avoiding or turning the subject, which, on the contrary, he at once introduced. he was not always right; but in some of his most particular games he did and said things which, in the end, resulted more to his detriment than to his advantage; yet the consequences of them he either sulked around or denied altogether. No, you needn't think you're going to get rid of me as soon as that, for I'm not going this week, nor next, nor week after, unless to get rid of me you turn this miserable Irish termagant out of the house, for I'm not going to leave her to dress and take care of mother," she said, emphatically. "Well, I'm glad you are going to stay. I would rather have you stay than not, for it will be company for me. But maybe Mrs. Bentley would as lief take care of mother," he replied, blandly. "No, she can't, for she is not stout enough to lift her. It wants some strong, healthy woman, and one who will be respectful aud gentle towards her, using no words improper for a lady to hear. Mother is so child-like and simple, that she could not if she would reprimand any improper words which may be uttered in her presence." "I know it, and perhaps we had better get some one to take charge of her. I guess I will, for I think that will be the best way," he said, hastily, thinking himself quite clever for bringing it around in such a way. "But what are you going to do with Bridget? You don't propose to keep her too, I hope?" she said earnestly, mingled with sadness. "O, there is enough for her to do without having any care of mother. She can make the butter, and cook, which, I think, will be enough for one," he replied. "I suppose you've heard the not very flattering reports concerning her character, and which her demeanor very strongly justifies." "I certainly have not," he slowly rejoined. "Have you seen or heard anything from her, which led you to sup- pose she is not what a woman should be?" she asked.  "Not one word; neither have I seen one sign of anything unbecom- ing a woman," he said, slowly and abstractly, as if he had thought over everything she had ever done. 12   134        LOVE,ON THE WING.  "Well, you must be blind, and deaf, and stolid to maidenly modesty, if you've seen nothing unbecoming in her manners. I suppose you  call it modest and becoming for a woman to stand on an elevated stoopl and wring out clothes, or scrub off the steps with her dress pinned up  to her knees, her feet bare, do you?" she asked, with a sneer. "I never saw anything of the kind, and if I had, I shouldn't think it of any consequence."  "No, I suppose not, for you, never think anything of any consequence,  no matter how shameful or disgraceful it may be," she said, despond-  ingly. "But say, I want to ask it as a favor, if you entertain any re-  spect for our feelings, and the good name of the family, to dispense with this thing. I'll send you a decent girl, one of' whom no one need  be ashamed, and one who, if she adds nothing. to the good reputation  of the family, will take nothing from it; for you must be persuaded that it is not you alone who suffers, but your sisters and their children are the ones who will be the most affected. If there:was no one but yourself, it would be different, and even then it would be objectionable, as stories derogatory to a man's interests would be continually going round, and every decent woman would look upon you with suspicion, thinking you had no more self-respect than to keep a woman whom everybody else would be ashamed to recognize in the streets," Mrs. Bordman said, warming up, much to her brother's uneasiness. "O, well, we'll have somebody else here in a short time, and you are going to stay too; so I think as long as there is such a houseful, there will be no danger of any remarks, especially as I have two sisters here to defend me," he said, impatiently, and left the room. "Well, now, what do you think of it?" she asked, turning towards Mrs. Bentley. "I think by perseverance we will succeed; but I hope you will not for a moment think of wavering, for you see I'm here, and she has heard what we've said, and it will be perfectly impossible to live with her after you have gone, she is such a revengeful creature,' she said, with a shudder. "I won't forsake you and my mother, for it certainly is our duty to get rid of the miserable thing in some way or another. I never did undertake a thing yet but I carried it through, and if I fail now, I'll have to record the first failure in my life," she said. "I wouldn't be so urgent, if I did not think it was for the best, for the best interests of the family; for surely somebody else can be found  who has not so many objections against her, and who would perform her duties as well, and be more acceptable to the family."    PLOTTING.            135 "It shall be done, for I'm determined not to go back home until it is; so you can make up your mind that I'm going to stay all winter with you,", she said, pleased to think her sister did not longer object to William's remaining single. "O, I'm so glad you have taken up the subject in earnest, for I feared at one time that he would block the game, and not yield even to our united entreaties. I think we had better appeal to his love for his sisters, for that seems to touch him the most; for himself he cares noth- ing, as he can storm it through alone; but when we come in for a share of the shame, and people point their finger at us for encouraging the presence of one so distasteful to them, and to every moral sentiment, in the house of our brother, then he will keenly feel that it is wrong, and should be remedied. No one else will know anything about the trials we endure, the labor we' have expended, I hope not in vain, in trying to get rid of her? if they knew, we would not be near as much to blame in their eyes as we would be if we didn't try at all. But then we must succeed, for there is no other alternative except shame, and perhaps sin. If I thought such a thing possible, I wouldn't stay in the house with her another night," Mrs. Bentley said, horrified at such a thought. "I don't think it is as bad as that yet, but it certainly will become worse and worse so long as she remains here; and it is far better to do at once, that which would be very hard to accomplish a few years to come. It is like a disease, easily cured on the start with some mild remedy, but after it gets firmly seated, it will require more stringent measures, and then, perhaps, kill the patient. If he only could marry her to some one, not too low to be company for her, it would be well enough; but then who would marry the miserable thing? I am sure I wouldn't, if I never had a wife." "No, indeed, nor any one else; for she has no idea of what the first requirements of a wife are, and if she knew, to be contrary, she would not perform them. She is the most obstinate and self-willed, besides being the meanest woman whom I have ever had the pleasure of know- ing, and I hope I never shall enjoy such a pleasure again." That evening the subject was again renewed, and in fact every even- ing that intervened from its first introduction, until Mrs. Bordman left for her home in the West, with pretty much the same success which had attended their first efforts. He always said he would get some one to take care of mother, but never said he would drive her out doors. He didn't want to kick her out, because father had said, when asked what would become of her and mother, that he guessed he could take   136        LOVE ON THE WING. care of them. It was argued on the other side that he needn't kick her out, nor use any violence whatever towards her, but simply open the door and tell her to please pass through, with their very best wishes for her future happiness and prosperity in the world, and that she would in the future never honor the place with her delightful presence. They continued to urge upon William the expediency of adopting the measures they had advanced, but he evaded the subject, or by promises of some other change allayed their fears; at one time, how- ever, he did partly decide to let her go, then her tears, her dependent condition, and her usefulness to him, prevailed over all other consider- ations, until at last it was determined to let her remain a little while longer, and see if many of the objections which had been raised against her could not be removed by a little discipline, which he pro- posed to administer.  It was a sad conclusion ti the ladies, and more especially to Mrs. Bentley, who, left alone, woul/d be exposed to all the fury of her wrath; for William's word or authority with her had but very little effect, when once her mind was made up and her anger excited; and she resolved to make good use of the opportunities offered, and to repay back the debt she had contracted, by being in Mrs. Bentley's way. It was more aggravating still to have the pudding she had taken so much pains to make, seeing it was the last day of Mrs. Bordman's stay at Nestoria, rejected as being unfit to eat. William ate not only what had been, served out to him, but also that of one of his sisters, and thought it was excellent, only a little burned on the bottom; but no one need eat that. He could not see why people's tastes were so much better than his own, or why they should be so particular about. a little crust. It was Eufficient to cause a long crying spell, and which could only be hushed up by the declaration that one was soon going, and per- haps the other would by and by. She said, " she would never cook another meal as long as his good-for-nothing sister staid in the house, and he might get rid of her as quick as he was a mind to." One thing was certain, both of them could not stay there, and we will see which one it was who had to go.    BRIDGET LECTURES WILLIAM.          137 CHAPTER XXI. BRIDGET AND BENTLEY.-DEATH OF THE, MOTHER. IRS. Bordman started for her home on the day after the one on which the miserable pudding was served, and of which William partook so much that he had a severe attack of colic, which incapaci- tated him from eating for a number of days. The first thing after she was gone, William had to listen to a long lecture from Bridget, who bewailed her loss for being Irish, and wished she had never been born. "There could be no other reason why people hated her so, for she al- *ways tried to be good, and to use everybody well; but it was no use trying, for she had always expected to be kicked out as soon as the old man died, but if she went she would have her revenge, and just give 'em a piece of her mind. She would let 'em know that she was just as good as the rest of 'em, if she was Irish. She would like to know what everybody had against the Irish, to make everybody hate 'em so. She wouldn't be Irish, but she would just have her name changed from Bridget to Catherine, and the O'Conor, she would have that changed pretty soon. She would fix out all these paupers, beggin' round for a living, and abusin' poor folks who work for theirs. For her part, he had got to turn that miserable sister of his out, and find a boarding- place for the whole tribe somewhere, for she wouldn't wait on 'em and then be abused for it by 'em, the miserable brats. She wondered what in the world he wanted to bring 'em there for; in the place there wasn't enough, she supposed, in the house already. W ether there was enough or not, they had to be brought here on purpos to abuse folks. Well, what are you going to do with 'em? keep 'em here You needn't stand there rubbing your nose, but go and wait on your lazy, pauper relatives, for I'm. bound if I will, if they stay there till they rot." Such language, and worse,- as it would not do to put in everything she said,-she used at the first opportunity she had. Mrs. Bentley ex- pected it, and had steeled her feelings against the influence of her poi- sonous words, by resolving that if she used any unbecoming language towards her, to take up the poker, or any weapon which happened to be at hand, and to deal out condign vengeance upon her guilty head; and she would, for she told William that if she troubled her while she was in the house, they would have an Irish wake there in a short time: and 12    138        LOVE ON THE WING. William had cautioned Bridget of the danger of saying anything to Mrs. Bentley, because she was a high-tempered woman, and when once enraged, was crazy to such an extent, that she was not responsible for her acts; consequently, the best way to get along with her, was to give her a wide path, and let her respectfully alone. This injunction she had obeyed to the letter, never once speaking in her presence in other than a subdued tone, though at times she was very reluctant, and half- inclined to try her a hand, and see if she was such a terrible woman as William had represented to her; but more prudent counsels prevailed, and a war which seemed imminent, soon after blew over, and peace, such peace as William always had, but with which he seemed content, spread her bright pinions over the bereaved household, to be disturbed only by fitful blasts of storm, sure to come after every brief Sunshine. It was nearly one month after Mrs. Bordman left the wrangling par- ties at Nestoria, and the cold, bleak winds of December were blowing across the hills of Cayuga, bringing with them the cold and frost of a northern clime; when the wind sighed in mournful cadences through the chinks, and heaped up a little bank of snow by the kitchen door, and pilled its huge banks by the gate, and under the awning, on the piazza, and on the window-sills, and hung in festoons from the gables of the roof, and all along over the eaves it drooped down, as if it was about to fall and crush its beautiful form to ,pieces. The trees in the yard were ladened with the flaky snow, so that their boughs were bent down to the ground, and were imprisoned there in the freezing em- brace. No one went there to shovel away' the snow, for all were busy; and they looked so picturesque and sad, and would, perhaps have been unnoticed, but for the sadness of the event which it seemed to herald. All were busy with activity around. Horses and cutters were coming and going to and from Nestoria, bearing eager, anxious friends; within all was still and quiet, and none moved from room to room, unless on tiptoe, for fear of disturbing the patient, who, stricken by a third para- lytic stroke, was now lying in the arms of a gentle. slumber, from which no earthly noise could wake her, and from which she would never awaken to the light of a terrestrial sun again. When she awoke she would be in another clime, and lit by every revolving sun around, though never setting, and where night, and darkness, and sleep doth never come. How sudden and strange was that transition! to go to sleep in this world and wake up in the next. The wife and mother was dying; and William, poor boy, such bitter tears he shed! The livelong day, from morning till night, he wept; and nothing could he say or do, from the choking emotions of rising tears, so   DEATH OF THE MOTHER.           1&9 impetuously and constantly; for he feared from the first he would never again lift her into a carriage, and ride with her through the tortuous road and over the hills, then down again into the valley by the running brook they had so often crossed together. It was night, and they all stood around the death-bed and watched the expiring light, as it flickered and burned but dimly each fast wan- ing moment. William was there, holding her clammy hand in his, and feeling as if he was just reaching across the grave, connecting life with death. Calm he sat, and motionless, nor looked up when others spoke, for his eyes were wet, and red, and swollen with weeping; but he wept not there; he would not let othlers see his grief, nor witness the deep, inconsolable sorrow of his heart. When he wept, he went out where none could see, and there in solitude wept alone. But the hand of- death stole in, and tore away his victim right out of William's arms, whom, himself, though strong, he could not hold. Richard was there, though not weeping like William; in fact, no other tears were shed but his, save those of the little children and his aunt, and we expect them to weep if others do; but of all the older people, none wept save William and his aunt; and she did weep more because it was the fashion, than because the dead had died. They all left the room, save the ladies who were to lay her out; and William came to Richard inquiring for the board on which to lay the corpse when it was dressed in the habiliments of the tomb. He asked for the board which was used before, and then burst out crying. He could say no more, for tears and sobs choked up his utterance; and Richard, pitying the broken heart, put his arms round his neck, and said, "Don't cry, Will, we will all be there soon; she has only gone before us a-few days, to light the way along the rugged path." The tears dried up like the dew before the scorching rays of the sun, when he heard how soon we would follow; but the fountain did not, for soon more tears were falling like rain against the glass; nor did they cease until after she was laid away beneath the sod, there to moulder away to dust, from which we all have sprung. The house was sad and desolate then, although filled to overflowing, because the mother had gone, and her chair stood empty in the corner, in which she so long had sat and rolled about the house, but never again, through all the long, weary years of time, - never again! The children were all gathered round the hearthstone again, though in sadness gathered;. but 'it is a duty we all owe to one another, whether related by blood or not. It is the last testimonial of respect the living can pay to those whom they have loved, and whom they still love,   "O        LOVE ON THE WING. though snatched from their embrace. The first thing to be considered now, was what should be done with Bridget, for it became evident to all that it would be impossible for her to live there with Mrs.. Bentley; and so when it was proposed to have her discarded, William rebelled, and thought some other way could be devised which would settle the difficulty better, and leave all the parties in agreeable, if not prosper- ous circumstances. He did not see how he could get along without her, and he did not wish to try to get along without her; for no one knew the ways of the place as well as she did, and he did not want to stop to teach any one just then, for he had his hands full. He was hinting to them, in the hope'they would be able to think of some way better than to drive any one out, for he did not like to do that unless it was one who was very mean, and then' not on the first provocation. Mrs..Bentley had declared right up and down she would not stay there with the miserable thing, for she certainly was not fit to live with decent people, nor with any other kind; for she had heard and seen things which had. shocked her modesty terribly, and she was certain that if such was the beginning, the ending would be a good deal worse; and it was bad enough already, Heaven knew, and the deceased parents, if such a thing is possible, must visit the place in their spirit- ual presence, their faces showing their disapproval, while their eyes and half-muttered words breathed scorn. Mrs. Bordman thought "if she were married to some one, and then kept the house in as good a style as she was able, that would be very nice." "Capital!" William exclaimed, as if he had just now for the first time thought of it, " and he had the-one out in the tobacco-shed whom he would select above all others. He was a good worker and a good calculator, and one to whom he could leave the management of the place in case he wanted to go off for a short time. Such a one was Richard; and he would intimate the subject to him on that very day, arid see what he thought about it," he said, apparently much pleased with the project. "You needn't say anything to him about marrying her, for he would as soon marry a negro wench as marry the miserable, good-for-nothing thing. Richard is ambitious, and is desirous of a good name, which he never can have with her on his hands to protect; for she would be more a clog and a hinderance to him than a helpmate, and he could get along far better without her, fighting his own battles alone," Mrs. Bentley said.  "O, I don't know about that; especially if 1 make it for his own in-   MORE CONSULTATION.            141 terest; and I think I shall be able to show, by the inducements I can offer, that it would be much to his advantage to marry pretty soon, and I'll intimate that Miss Bridget will make any one, who is so fortunate a good wife; and I'll say further, that I should like to have them stay here a while, before they go to keeping house themselves, so I can have a chance to look around and find some one else," he said, as he glanced pleasantly, and bowed knowingly in the direction of Mrs. Bord- man. O, that will be nice, and it is so convenient; he is just the right age to marry now. Let me see, how old is he?--twenty-five, ain't he  Yes, just the right age; and she is twenty, just right: and he has such a good disposition, that it will make a first-rate match. I wonder why we didn't think of it before," Mrs. Bordman said. "It's all very well if you can make him think so, and of that I have very grave doubts," said Mrs. Bentley. "Well, do let us try, won't you? for there is surely no harm in try- ing.. For my part, I can't see why he should raise many objections against it, as she is not bad looking, and she is a smart, clean house- keeper; and as for her temper, why, he can get along with that, the same as other husbands do, who have cross, scolding wives." "What if he wont; what then?"Mrs. Bentley asked. ' Well, he must, that's all; for there is no other way to get around it after he is married," she said, earnestly. ' There is no other way, eh? If I were a man, and heard such lan- guage as I heard her use. the other day towards William, do you know what I'd do?." she asked, with sparkling eyes. "No." "Well, I'd take the first dish, plate, cup, saucer, or poker - anything that happened to be at hand, and ]'d hit her over that nose of hers, and see if I couldn't make it turn downwards, that's what I'd do, now I tell you," she said, bowing her head sidewise, in a very threatening manner.  "' Well, of course we can try and see what will come of it," he said, impatiently; and rising, left the room. "I don't know but I said too much, but I do hate the miserable thing, so I couldn't help it; but then he'll get over it, for I never saw him so mad yet but he would get over it in five minutes. I won't say anything against it any more; and if he wants to marry her, why let him, for it's none of my business, only I'll have to get out of here, and find some other house. But it's my candid opinion he won't marry her, that's all; and if he does, he'll wish he hadn't, for she is the meanest   "2        LOVE ON THE WING. woman I ever saw. I don't believe you can find another such one if you look the world over. I have seen people, before now, who de- ighted and seemed to take pleasure in doing good, but I never saw one before who took so much comfort in trying to be mean; for, if she sees any one whom she thinks is enjoying himself too well, she will go in and raise such a row that all comfort for that day is gone, and she does it, not because she has a reason, but because she delights in it, just for the thing itself. It's what I call personified meanness, or a love of meanness for itself. I heard her, no longer ago than the day before mother was taken down, use words towards William, because he rubbed his feet, which were a little muddy, on the mat at the door before com- ing in; and such words, the most depraved, the most profane, the most indecent, the most vulgar, I think that ever before escaped from the pol- luted lips of the most sunken wretch who ever disgraced this. fair earth with his presence." "Well, for goodness' sake, do stop, and let the girl live, and maybe Richard will be able to reform all these bad traits, and make her a respectable woman." "Respectable woman, indeed! that she never was, nor ever will be; for I think she is past redemption, past all cure; and I have formed a very wrong estimate of Richard's character if he pays her the least attention, or entertains for a moment the proposition. I certainly, for one, shall not hold him in much esteem if he does. And I am of the opinion that I shall not be alone in it, - even you, yourself, would not respect him, nor any one else; for when a man thus debases himself,- he forfeits the respect of every decent person." "Why, sister! why do ycu hate her so? for I'm sure I have heard nothing yet that will carry out the sweeping denunciations you have pronounced against her. She is Irish, and has an acrimonious temper; but others have lived with such, and why can't he?" "You don't pretend to say that her temper, and her Irishry, are all that can be said against her, do you? If you do, I could enlighten your mind to a vast deal more, if it were proper for me to speak it; but I would rather the words I would have to employ would never pass my lips; even the thoughts they convey are sinful, and should not for a moment be indulged in." "You hate her most cordially." "And so should you - so should everybody; for the only way you can overcome vice is to frown it down, excluding vicious persons from our presence and protection, and make them think there is no place for them but the dungeon or the gallows."   BRIDGET CONDEMNED.           143 "Woman to a woman should be charitable." "Woman! Do not apply so general a term to so mean a wretch, for in so doing you do but lower yourself to her level. The name of woman is outraged by being applied to her. A she-devil is the better name, and it is the one that becomes her best." "Do not be profane, or in condemning her you will sin yourself." "It is not profane, for the devil exists and lives in her; it is not pro- fane to say devil, for I've heard ministers use worse in the pulpit, when they were preaching, not less fervently than I am, against the sin and wickedness of the world." "You ought not to call it sin and wickedness; for words cannot ab- solutely be called wicked, without some wilful intent or act." "They can't, eh? It ain't wicked to swear, is it - using the most profane language wickedness itself ever thought of." "Well, yes, I suppose it is; that is, absolute profanity. And you are positive you heard her swear?" Yes, positive; but why do you doubt me? Do you think I would say what I have, if I were not certain she deserves it, and more? And how wicked the soul must be when the mouth utters such words." "It's never too late to repent, you know; 'for though thy sins be as scarlet, yet they can be made white as srow.' It says so somewhere, I believe, in the good book; and if she will reform, why, do not let us withhold the opportunity." "In the way you propose, you would but encourage her in her wick- edness, and make her worse." "But you will let us try, won't you? Maybe he'll be fool enough to step in the trap, and get caught." "If he does, I'm much mistaken in the man, and I guess you have some faint misgivings." "Well, if I have, I'm not going to tell them, as you are doing. I don't believe in making a simpleton of myself, by going round telling all I know to everybody."  "I hope you don't call it going round telling of it, for us to sit here and talk of that which is our business, and no one's else?" "No, not. exactly; but you talk a great deal more than I do, and say things that I wouldn't. I'm more discreet and careful of what I say." "I suppose you'd rather keep silent, than to reprove vice and sin, wouldn't you?" "' I wouldn't reprove it, if it was not my business. Neither you nor I will suffer for her."   "4        LOVE ON THE WING.                 " ( We'll suffer in repute; our names will be tarnished, and the finger of outraged scorn pointed at us." "By whom?" "By everybody who dares to rebuke audacious wickedness." "Everybody I defy, and dare them to do their worst." "O, do not talk so, sister; for no one can do wrong or protect wrong  in this world, and be respected." "We'll have their disrespect then. I suppose we can live in the world somewhere, can't we?" "We! You may, but I never shall. If this thing continues thus, I'll seek a new home, for I would rather die outright than be associated with such a vile wretch. Now remember, sister, if worse comes to worse, that I warned you in time, for no good can come of this." "Leave it all to me, and I'll take care of it, and see that no harm befalls our good name. Can you trust me with so sacred a charge?" "If there is no other alternative, then I must ;. but if you aid in dis- missing her, I would feel much more safe." "W e will try and marry her first, and- then if that don't work, we will get rid of her. Does that suit you " "It's better than your cold indifference." But you are satisfied to leave it thus for a little while?"  "If it is the best that can be done, yes; if not, no." "Well, can you think of anything better?" "Yes, kick her out, and tell, or let Richard marry a decent woman, that is better." "But perhaps she wouldn't please William so well." "You mistake him; for anything which has the form and attributes  of a woman would please William.'  "I think you wrong him."  "Not so much as you, by allowing her to stay, will wrong both your- self and him." "How?" "I've already told you- by encouraging and protecting such wick- edness." "But, come; there's the bell for supper. We'll talk of this again  some time," Mrs. Bordman said, rising and going towards the door. i                               41 ,  :.    RICHARD DESCRIBED.           145 ,9145 CHAPTER XXII. RICHARD AND WILD.--AN EVENING'S SOCIAL TALK. ABOUT one week after the above dialogue took place, William was seated in the dining-room - this is right back of the sitting- room; and this was occupied by the ladies, who occasionally passed through on some little errand connected with the affairs of the house - with Richard. A decanter of whiskey was standing on the table, with a bowl of sugar, a pitcher of water, and two goblets. The time was well chosen, for it was Saturday evening. Seeing this is the first introduction of Richard in the play, we think a picture of him advis- able. Physically, Richard is a large, robust man, measuring six feet, and( weighing over two hundred pounds, and well proportioned. His com- plexion is light, with auburn hair and blue eyes, with regular features, and a red, ruddy glow always upon them: altogether, he is a bluff, hale, hearty man. In temperament, he is taciturn, morose, and gloomy. In manners, he is reserved and distant to strangers, but affable to friends. He is seldom angry, and when lle is, you find it out without being told of it, for he never says a thing unless pushed to the wall; then he shows fight. He is very bashful, and afraid of the girls, never having gone home with one from the singing-school or prayer meeting; but often wished to, and walked along out of the porch of the church where the singing-schools were held, very close to the girl he dare  not ask, "Please, ma'am, may I see you home to-night?" He saw other young men asking, and accompanying the ladies home; even the very one he longed so much to accompany always had an escort, some- times forestalling Richard, much to his chagrin, and sometimes anger  but at other times he had noble opportunities, but they all went by un- employed; and even when asked by the fair beloved herself, and who promised her he would, he passed her by on the step where she awaited him, while his heart palpitated in his mouth. "What a fool I am," he said; "another opportunity lost! Why didn't I put my arm around her, and walk along?"  He slept very little that night, and passed1 it mostly in condemning himself. In after years he had the name of being a woman-hater; but in this case the term was misapplied, for there never beat a truer or more 13   "6  ,     LOVE ON THE WING.  loving heart for the female sex than beat in Richard Lovell's breast.  His first efforts were dampened by the unsuccessful results which at- tended them, else he would not have lived so long in single blessedness; but the same tender, clinging love still remained which had been offered to Mary, and returned, which he nourished and kept warm, resolving that some good woman should have the whole, perfect and entire. Not * one single fibre of his heart clustered round the object he had so fondly and so dearly loved. It never turned into hate, for never did he wish any evil to befall her who had so coldly and proudly rejected him; but he rather hoped some good man would get her, and be to her what he had hoped, and vainly offered to be - a good husband. He seldom drank, and then only at a special invitation and with a particular friend; for he did not like it, and its effects always left him in the lurch. On this, and like occasions, he drank with William, more in the hope of drowning the sorrow which he knew William felt for the loss he had suffered, and to be with him, and to fill the place thus left vacant in William's heart, never once dreaming what were the motives which prompted William to be thus civil and friendly towards him; for William, when he courted, was servile and fawning, over- looking every whim and foible. It was, therefore, with many gracious m -words and winning smiles that he persuaded Richard to taste, and when he had tasted, to drink; and from drinking, once to drinking twice, yes, thrice and when so much was drank, it did not require much urging to drink more. Thus they spent night after night, drinking till they both became intoxicated to such an extent that navigation was not only difficult, but hazardous. This was the first night's debauch, and the following is the conversation they had over the well-filled glasses, filled much too often and too full to please Richard, who was slow to drain his to the bottom; and he often looked one side, as if seeking some  place to throw that which he was reluctant to drink; and the last glass-  ful always remained nearly full, as the often repeated entreaties to drink, and fill up again, were unheeded, until the lateness of the hour compelled them to retire. Well, Richard, I suppose you don't mind taking a drop, do you, on  this cold, freezing night?" he asked smiling, pushing towards him the  glass and decanter. "No, I don't care if I take a little; but I always like it in small, homeopathic doses, and often," he replied, taking the decanter and pour-  ing out a tablespoonful, which, after being well moistened with water,  and sweetened with sugar, he, drank. "That's pretty good drink, Richard; the best John N. keeps," he t, said, smacking his lips in evident satisfaction.   aI A SOCIAL EVENING.  :d                                147 "Well, yes, I suppose so; but I'm no judge of the article. 'he worst and the best always taste the same to me," he replied, while the burning liquid brought a scowl upon his face as he vainly endeavored to extract a pleasurable sensation in the draught, and to recollect, if possible, the taste of good whiskey. The business topics of the day were briefly discussed, and then another drink was proposed, to which Richard rather demurred, saying he was so drunk then he couldn't see straight; but William would listen to no objections, and finally, seeing Richard loath to fill up, took the glasses and filled them nearly full, hardly room enough being left for a little water and a spoonful of sugar, four of which drained all there was in the decanter, and which was replenished twice each night. "Well, say, you are not leaving much room in there for water," Richard said, as he looked in astonishment at the drinks he had pre- pared. "I know it; but you don't want only about enough to drown a louse, for too much water spoils a good drink, and I propose to treat my e company well," he said blandly, and bowed friendly. "Well, eh? The. friend whom you treat thus well, will have need of your friendship still further; for should I drink that, you would have to help me up stairs to bed," he replied, as he turned the spoon carefully, for fear of slopping it over on the table-spread, and occasionally sipped from it, which, to his surprise, did not materially lessen its coltents Drink hearty, Richard, and here's hoping," he said, as he raised the glass to his lips, nor took it hence till the glass was drained. "By Jove, Will! where did you put that? Here, take this; it will do me more good to see you drink than to drink myself," he said, as he shoved over the glass towards him. "No, no, drink it yourself; it won't hurt you," he said, his brow darkening. "Thunder and Mars! if I should drink that, I'd be sick a week," he said, as he held up the glass and scanned its awful depths, now sip- ping, then taking a larger swallow, in the hope that in larger quantities it would taste better; and then two or three swallows went down one after the other, always wrinkling his face into a scowl, whether a drop was taken or a spoonful. He was surprised to see that his greatest ex- ertions had only emptied the glass one half. "Come, come; what are you going to do with that? " he asked, no- ticing the act and the look with which Richard regarded the unemptied glass. "Zounds! I'm goiqg to throw it out of the window," he replied, advancing with the glass to the door.   "8        LOVE ON THE WING.                 . "Here! here! hold on. By gad, that costs - let me 'see - with the taxes, that's worth two dollars a gallon. Shut your eyes, and down with it, and let's have some more," he said, as he proceeded to pour out another glass, though there was not enough left in the decanter to fill it. "Come, drink that down, and we'll go and get some more." "More! You'd better wait till I drink what I have before you talk of more," he said, and with another exertion he swallowed the re- mainder, all but about a spoonful. "There, that's right. Now take that light, and come on, and we'll soon have some more," he said, leading the way down cellar. "There, stand off, not come too close, for the gas of this might communicate with the light, and we would have a blow-up, such as we are not so accustomed to having," he said, as he tipped over a barrel, holding the 'decanter under a small stream, which came trugh a gimlet-hole bored in the centre of the barrel.      "I should think you would have that rolled up on some blocks, and a faucet placed in the head, so you could draw with more pleasure and comfort," Richard said. O, this will do well enough; for if I had it fixed in that way, you and everybody else would be in here every day," he replied, tipping back the barrel, and looking at the decanter to see how full it was.  "Me? That barrel might stand there till all the hoops dropped off it, and not one drop of it would I touch," he replied. "Ha! is that so? But lead on, and we will see how much of this you will touch," he said, sneeringly. "Indeed, little of it would I touch if left alone, now I tell you. But, say; now I would advise you not to fill those glasses quite so full," he said, as William was filling Richard's glass. "But who is filling these glasses, I wonder'?"William asked, pleas- antly. "You are trying to, but you won't fill mine. There, now, that will do," Richard said, as he drew back William's arm, and taking up the glass, found it much too full to please him. "Here, let me pour some of this back, for I can't drink all this," he said, making a motion to take up the decanter, which William was  putting down, but seeing the motion, kept it in his hand. "There, now; put some sugar in that, and some water if you want,  ; and you have a drink that would cost you ten cents, if you was buying it," he said.  "And which I never would; for I'd rather drink from that brook yonder, the pure water as it runs over the mossy stones," he replied.    --:a RICHARD ADVISED TO MARRY.                149 "Yes, and swallow a snake, or a lizard, or some other reptile, con- stantly looking for such baby-suckers. Well, drink away, and here's luck, hoping." Hoping! Hoping that I'll not die if I drink this?" he asked. No; hoping for better times to come. Don't you ever hope to see such?" he asked, setting down the empty glass, and taking a cigar. "Come, down with that, and let's have a quiet smoke. The ladies are having fun in there, and why can't we?" The thought of a short reprieve was encouraging to Richard, so he down with the remainder, and took the cigar, which William had laid upon the edge of the table. "This is about as comfortable as in most places, and about as good a way to spend an evening as one could wish," he said, pleasantly. ' Rather cold these nights, ain't it?" he continued. "O, not very; at least not'to-night, with a half a gallon of whiskey burning to keep me warm." "But, say, did you ever think of marrying? These cold nights would make a fellow turn his thoughts that way, I should think, if it wasn't only to think of how pleasant it would be - only in the pro- spective, you know, you know." "Yes; a fellow may, as a matter of course, sometimes think of that which he would like wondrous well, if he could only get that which most assuredly would not be objectionable to his tastes; for you know it's a lottery game at best, and a feller may just as like as not draw a blank as a prize, you know." "Yes, I know; but, you see, it is just in this wise: Now, suppose you marry a woman, and, you know, if you didn't want to go to keep- ing house for a while, well, you wouldn't want to take her up home, would you? You might sell out that place up there, and bring your mother down here; and then, if you wanted to marry, why, of course you could." "Yes, I know I could; but mother, I - guess, wouldn't consent to move ko far from church, you know. She likes to go to church pretty vell, but you know she wouldn't like to walk so far. It ain't very far, though, but it's too far for her. She couldn't stand it nohow, I don't believe; do you?" "She might have a conveyance, for there is somebody going all the time up there, you know, and she might ride along just as well as not; for these girls here want to go to church, I suppose, and you would be just the one to drive them up there, you know; and if you would only marry and settle down this way somewhere, a little nearer, I'd like it 13    150        "OVE ON THE WING. ever so much, you know, and it would be pleasant to her, and to you, and to me, and your wife, whoever she might be, you know." "Yes, I know; but I don't hardly think she would like to sell her nice little home, for she has flowers set all round the walks in the garden and in front of the house, and she wouldn't like to leave them, any way, especially after she has been at so much pains to cultivate  them. Now, I tell you what it is, Will, them flowers are a very pleas- ing thing to have around one, and they make one feel as if he were at home, especially if he see a dark-eyed little duck of a lady supportin' a droopin' flower: an' she can do as she likes with 'em, you know, for they are hern, you know." '"Yes, but she can have them here, you know, justas well as there. Now I can't see, for my part, why she an' you can't just as well come down here as not, for there is plenty of room here; and if ever you want to marry, why, of course you can marry, you see." "But who do you suppose I can marry? Some of these ere gals around here, eh?" "Yes, anybody; suit yourself, you know you can; for this am a free country, and anybody can do just as he has a mind to, you know, fur that am the way that I allus done, an' I suppose you can do the same.  Now, you see, it is just like this: you are ambitious, and wish to do something in the world." "Yes, you are right in that. I would rather acquire fame than wealth." "Of course. Wall, you may do all there is to be done to acquire the fame, and I'll help you all I can. I'll make you rich, and you take the fame responsibility upon yourself; for that is something I don't know anything about." "Wall, all right; I'll go in on these terms, and I hope we will both be satisfied with the result." "Well, cum on, Rich; let's take another drink. I'm getting orful dry, talling so much." The t;, now; you just pour out your own, Will, for I don't purpose to drink all there is in that barrel of yours, now I tell you, fur I feel  now as if my head were a whiskey cask." "O, wall, if you ain't going to drink no more than that, you might as well drink water." "Wall, here's a good night's rest to you, Will, and I hope the fums of this ere licker won't make you dream; as for myself, I feel certint that a pure sleep awaits me. How many barrels of liquor do you sup- pose you ever drunk, Will? It must be hard on to a thousand, ain't it?"  'i   INTOXICATED. "O, no; not the half of them. A thousand! A man could swim thar allus, and never see the shore. I'll tell you what I'll do, IRich. If you'll just marry, and move in and take possession of this place while I travel a while, I'd like it hugely, for I want to go to Filadelaphee and Washingtun, to see the fight; and then, when I cum back, I want to go to Californee; so, you see, you'll have a clean sweep. here, and I'll pay you well, you know. You just see your mother, and see what she says."l "Well, I don't believe she'll sell out; but she might lease the place to some one fur a while, till you cum back. I don't know; we'll see. Be you goin' around these 'ere places alone?" "Well, no; thar is a party goin', and I was goin' along; that's all, you know. But, come; let's-have another drink, for I'm orlul dry." "Yes, an' the more you drink of that are fiery licker, the drier you'll be; and for my part, I'd rather be excused." "No, you don't. There, now; go ahead with that." "No, I'll pour out my own, fur I think I ken measure the capacitie of my stumuck better than you ken. There, now, hold on you needn't tip up my arm like that agin; I've got too much now I'll pour it back No, you don't. Hold on; you'll spile all thare is in the bottle, an' I'll have to throw it away."' "I don't care; fur you might as well throw it all away, as fur all the good it will do. Now, good night to yer; for I'm goin' to see if I ken find the way up them are stairs." "But, hold on; let's have a smoke." "Blast your smoke! I'm sicker than a dog now." "But, say; a smoke will make yer feel better." "No, it won't. Say, hold that are light here, will yer? Blast that are stove! Dum, if I hain't broke my nose over that are dum stove. Why didn't you hold the light a-fore? Talk of merrying, with such a nose as that are"  "Let me see. O, you hain't hurt your nose worth noticing. There, now, go ahead; your nose is all right:" "It was yer dum ole licker that hurt my nose; fur if I hadn't been drunk, I'd walked round the dum ole stove."   152        LOVE ON THE WING.  CHAPTER XXIII. ANOTHER EVENING'S SOCIAL TALK.  R  ICHARD awoke the next morning with a severe headache, which was not lessened when he attempted to comb his hair; and he found it so disagreeable, and-his legs so unsteady, that he agaih sought what comfort there was to be obtained from the pillow, and from which he did not stir that day. Not one mouthful did he eatall day; and he wondered what could possibly induce any one to love the horrid drink, when its effects were so unpleasant, and required so long a time in getting over them. He saw his mother during the week, and he communicated to her the proposition that William had made to him, respecting the sale of Cottage Grove, and to which she strongly objected--that is, .the part which related to her; but if Richard wished to marry, why, she had nothing to say, only she hoped he would get a good wife; but as for selling out the place, that she would never do; at least, as long as she could live there, and take care of herself, she preferred to live as she was. Just one week from the evening on which William and Richard par- took so freely of the hospitalities of Nestoria, which are so notorious to many of the villagers around, who often resort there to take a social glass or two with the generous, warm-hearted host, - they were again as- sembled in the. same room, situated in the same way, with the same prospects in view. Mrs. Bordman had returned home, leaving Mrs. Bentley to the tender mercies of a revengeful fury; conse- quently, there were not so many around to witness the exhilarating effects of too much drink, for Mrs. Bentley never encroached upon the privacy of the revellers; and only when they were a little noisy did one or both of the girls steal out on some pretext or another, against the  wishes of their mother. After a glass had been drained, the subject was again resumed. "Well, Richard, what does your mother think of it?Is she will- ing you should marry, and take possession?" he asked, as he puffed great clouds of smoke from his mouth, and watched their curling wreaths as they ascended to the ceiling, and then vanished away. "Yes, she is willing I should marry, but she won't sell the place, for ,   ANOTHER SOCIAL EVENING.          153 , ,                                 153 she says she would rather stay the thethan anywhere else in the world," he replied. "It's no matter, rfor you can stay here, and she there, until she feels as if she would like some help; then you can bring her down here, or you can go up there. So you conclude to marry, and take possession?" le asked, smiling pleasantly, "Yes, I'll marry'; but you know it requires two to make such a con tract, and a little time, for a man can't get up and marry without a moment's warning or preparation,; and perhaps the first attempt will fall through just as a man is beginning to think himself sure of her, and then he has to strike out and commence again. A fellow can hardly marry in less than a year, and I have heard of instances that required even a longer time than that." "Yes, quite frequently; but then I think this will meet with no such diliculties; for y ou won't have far to go, and I guess the parties are not so much opposed to it as they might be,'" he said, looking pleasantly, though curiously, at Richard. "Why, to whom do you refer? for I do not know of -any one very near here, unless it is that nervous Carman, and she - wall, she is a pretty good girl, but nervous. You don't refer to her?" "No; but there are other girls round here who are not nervous, and who will make good wives," he said, still watching Richard closely. "O, yes, there are any quantity of good marriageable girls around; but who, among them all, would you like to have me select? for I suppose you ought to have some choice in the selection." "Yes. Wall, we'll see. Let's take another drink. Wthy don't you drink that up, so as to make room for more? " he asked, as he proceeded to fill up his own glass. "The more I drink, the less room there is for more; neither do I mean to drink as much again as I did the other evening, for I don't very much fancy being sick all day.' I never felt so mean in all my life as I did last Sunday," he said, as he drained, tremblingly, the last in the glass. "O, wall, it won't make you feel so again; for the first time a fellow drinks it always affects him more than ever afterwards," he said, as he replenished Richard's glass. "There, that will do; that's all I want.; for if I am going to drink, I'll take it in small doses," he said, as he raised the glass to prevent too much being poured out, and which William, by bearing down sud- denly on the decanter, succeeded in almost filling. "By Jove! I'll take hold of that bottle after this, if that is the way   154        LOVE ON THE WING. you intend doing," Richard said, as he held the glass up towards the light, and saw in dread the quantity he had to put away. "It. won't hurt you an atom, but it will do a fellow good this cold weather. Say, Bridgee, hold on here a minit; here's a young man looking for a v'ife. Can you advise or direct him where he can find one?" he asked, as she came in, of course carelessly, and was about to depart. "Why, I dunno, I'm sure, unless he goes up an' gets Sophia. I dunno of anybody else that would have him," she said, sneeringly. O, yes; there are girls, I guess, who would like to marry very well, and maybe Richard could do full as well to marry somebody besides Sophia," he said, meekly, looking first at Richard, ,then at Bridget, thinking to turn his attention that way. "You are allus runnin' everybody else down to nothin' just because they dunno quite as much as you do. For my part, I'm sick a hearin' such fools talk; for you don't, any of you, know nothin', not enuf to go in when it rains," she said, laughing loud. O, no; I guess not so bad as that, for we mean to be as fair as possible in our dealings with everybody. So you don't know of any- body else, do you, whom Richard can get?" "No, I don't; unless he marries some Irish woman. I suppose he can find one good enuf fur him, can't he " "I don't know. She would have to be pretty good, the best I ever knew," he said, glancing pleasantly at her. "I know now. I have one in my mind. She is a nice young lady, now I tell you; and maybe, if you will put in a good word for me, I can get her. She used to go to school with me at the Elbridge Academy," Richard ingenuously said, seeing the drift, and, wishing to avoid getting too far in that direction, he hastened to turn the subject. "O, no you don't, fur May bees don't fly now, this cold weather; they got through last fall, about the middle of November," she hastily put in,-and finished'with a loud laugh. William only smiled. * I guess they will fly around the wife I get, and I hope without sting- ing either of us i at least, I shall take particular care not to get stung myself," Richard replied, without looking at either, occasionally sipping from the glass he held in one hand and slowly stirring with the other. A cloud darkened William's brow. "O, dear, you're almost as smart as William is; and I dunno if you had one more drink down you would be purty near. Well, you just wait till he gives the good word; fur if you don't marry till he does, I'm f6ared your hairs will be white and thin, like his, afore you get that   I BRIDGET'S INDEPENDENCE.          15 nice little school-girl of yours," she said, again laughing out loud, ac- companied with a look of insolence which she cast at Richard, unre- deemed by the slightest modesty. "O, well, Richard, we'll find somebody, if we don't have to look very far; and if we do, we will cast our eyes in the direction you have sug- gested," he said, winking slyly at Bridget. No, you don't-; you needn't think you are going to bring anybody here to abuse me, just as your old sister has been trying to do; for if you do, I'll break her head with the poker; fur I've got enuf abuse already from your dum' poor relatives, an' I shan't put up with it much longer, now I tell you. You needn't think that 'cause I'm Irish, I'm goin' to put up with everythin', now I tell you. I took care of your father's rotten face when it smelt so bad that I had to run to the win- der to get some fresh hair to keep me from spewin' up Jonah ail over him, an' this is all the thanks I git fur it, to be abused by your dum' old sister an' her good-for-nothin' brats. I'll kick her out doors to- morrow morning if she don't keep out of my sight, fur I can't say a word, nor do a thin', without she has got to stick her nose in. Now, you mind what I tell you, will you?" she said, as she cast a leering look of defiance at Wiliam. "O, I wouldn't go to using any harsh means, especially' this cold weather. Wait till spring, and I'll fix up that house where M -- lives, and she may move down there, where she can have all the field to her- self, to say and do just as she is a mind to," he blandly replied. "I'll put her out afore then, now I tell you; fur I'll be durned if I'll live in the house along with such a miserable, good-for-nothin' thin'. I don't see what they want to brin' her here fur, in the furst place, fur she orter gone to the poor-house, or somewhere else," she said, with a look of revenge, accompanied with a diabolical grin. "O, wall, it won't do to be so hard on her, if she is ruther acrimo- nious and hasty in her accusations. We'll provide for her somewhere, for she is a widow, and my sister, and it wouldn't look very well to turn her out now," he said, smiling. "Well, she must keep her nose out of my business, or I will, now I tell you; fur I've made up my mind, and you know what to depend on," she said, staring malignantly in the direction of the sittillng-room door, "I don't care if she does hear me, fur I've hearn what she said about me, an' I purpose to pay her off in her own coin. I'd never sai;l nothin' agin her, an' she no business to turn back on me in that 'ere way," she said, still staring at William. She arose from her seat by the stove, where she had rested, taking particular pains not to let her   156        LOVE ON THE WING. feet, which she placed upon the hearth, be concealed, for fear the flow- ing drapery might come in contact with the red-hot stove. "She is a mighty nice housekeeper, and if I only could get her - I mean if she would only; but the thing of it is, I don't hardly believe - maybe, though, you might marry a good wife, and I don't know but that school-girl would make a first-rate one; but you see, Bridget's been here so long, and is acquainted with the ways of the house, and the manner of doing everything. I suppose I shall have to fix her up a room; no, she can take the front room. I just as lief she would have it as not, and then I will have her always near," he said, with a know- ing bow. "I suppose she is indispensable to the good keeping of the house, and it would be almost impossible to live without her. But what woman do you suppose is coming here to be bullied around by her. You can't find one, sir, in this country," Richard emphatically rejoined. "O, she ain't very bad, when once you get acquainted with her. You ain't acquainted with her yet," he said, flatteringly. "No, neither do I mean to be. I have heard enough of that tongue to satisfy, me that it is a very unruly and quarrelsome member, and apparently beyond her control. A man must have a cast-iron mind to be able to endure what she says without an open or implied rebuke," Richard said. "O, well, when you get acquainted with her, you won't feel like that. She is just like the weather, and that you know is sometimes cloudy." "But more times cloudy than sunshine. But what is a fellow to do when it clouds up?" "Why, just wait till the blow's over, and then there will be a Calm, more pleasant and beautiful than it could possibly have been if the i    storm had not risen." "Humph! Pshaw, man! you must be crazy. Deliver me from such storms. I never wish to see one arise to overshadow the brightness of my domestic bliss, and, if I can prevent it, there never will be a cause for one to arise; for nothing, in my humble opinion, is more objection- able than to see a married couple ever quarrelling, or ever allow a word of dissension to be exchanged; and if both are equally solicitous for the happiness of the family, there will be no contention." "O, well, we've got to take them just as they are, and make much or little of them as we can, for I can't see how the world would get along if every one was as sensitive on that point as you are. I never find any fault, but take what I can get, and let the rest go, for it seems to me that is the best way."   ;              RICHARD ON LOVE.           157 d1 i$ i"You have as good a right to your opinion as I have to mine, and 'as there is- plenty of room yet in the world, we can both of us enjoy our own; you yours, and I mine. If you wish to hear perpetual dis- cord, that is your privilege; but as for me, give me liberty - no, peace, or give me death. You measure love by expediency; I measure it with a heart overflowing with love. Now, think- if that love should receive a cold rebuke, or an angry word, how hurt and mortified it would feel! It would cringe down and slide back whence it came, seeking a warm, congenial place for its bruised affections; and when once it is with- drawn, it can never be restored. Think now of a woman's love, for that is more clinging, delicate, and tender than ours; think of its being reposed in some object, with all its devoted tenderness, to that object it clings for protection and encouragement, with that fondness and devotion of which a woman's heart is only capable; and then to think that that love is reposed in a mean and an unworthy object, to meet only scorn, ridicule, and contempt, instead of its being received and nourished in the secret, mysterious chambers of a loving heart. Do you suppose that that love would keep itself there under those cir- cumstances? She would withdraw it, thinking, and rightly, that she could take better care of it herself." "We are talking now of real things, not of. imaginary ones. I'm a practical man, and you are a theoretical one; now we will see which is the nearest right." "How will you tell " "By the success which attends our efforts." "You have wealth, while I have none; and I must contend alone, and single-handed, against you and your influence for the mastery. Well, we will see. We will see if right does not triumph, for I had rather have one single woman's heart than all your wealth, for then I might with it acquire wealth, while you may lose the wealth without ever receiving the love. Neither should we decide the case by the suc- cess which attends uts: let happiness be it, and then see; for a man may be successful and fortunate, and still not be happy, while he can be happy, and successful, and fortunate." "As well as for me, as well as for you. I may be happy as well as successful, at the same time adopt only practical measures. But say, I think I can make it for your advantage to marry and settle with me, and I want you to stay till you are twenty-one; for you can be of use to me, and I to you, in the plans I propose to make. Now, if you will only marry, and I should happen to kick the bucket first, I'll leave you "   158        LOVE ON THE WING. the place; but if you go first, and leave heirs, I'll provide for them; they shall not suffer, nor, in fact, need anything - ain't that fair?" "That is fair enough, providing I have such a wife who will reflect no discredit upon me; for I suppose you are aware it is rather a deli- cate position to place a wife in: for she would have to be a woman far i above suspicion, and in whom the utmost confidence could be placed *  by everybody, else the scandalous whispers of gossippers would make it rather unpleasant for all; for I could not always be in the house when you were, and I would be compelled to place the utmost reliance in her constancy and great trust in you, perhaps more than the circum- stances would warrant; consequently all the odium would fall upon me, if my wife were not such in whom the people copld confide. In this case, I have yet to- see how the proposition is going to benefit me; for I, you know, ought to have a little chance in the world, along with the rest of my fellow'-brethren." "Well, let's have another drink, for we are doing pretty well to night, and getting along first rate. But think of it a little, and you will see that it will be for your interest to comply; but'you want to throw all those delicate scruples out of your consideration entirely; for if you allow them a place in your mind, you won't think on it favorably. There, take that." "No, hold on, I propose to pour out my own; for I hardly think you are as generous about that marrying project as you are about this. At any rate, I would rather take small doses, and if necessary, take them oftep. Well, here's hoping 'll get that pretty, golden-haired school- girl."  "Drink hearty, and get her if you can," said he, but a cloud gathered upon his biow. "Now, let's have a cigar, and we will have a quiet smoke." "Say, it's about twelve now; but then to-morrow is Sunday, and we can lay as long as we are a mind to." So they sat and smoked a while, and talked over indifferent topics the- remainder of the time; occasionally, however, a distant allusion  was made to the subject which had been discussed, but upon which they came to no satisfactory conclusion, for they agreed but to disagree on almost every topic they introduced, one to spite the other:; After a while, however, Richard left, and went off to bed, leaving William alone with his meditations. He was not alone long before Bridget came  - back, and inquired " how he made out." "But say, you ought not to talk quite so bluntly in his presence, for if you do, you will never get him." A   BRIDGET MORE INDEPENDENT.          159 "I don't care if I don't. Do you suppose I'm goin' to let him run on me? no, sir, I ain't, now I tell you." "He don't run on anyb)oy, nor offer to; but before you know it you blurt out some spiteful word, which sends a chill right through him." "Well, he has got to learn what it is, an' he migyht as well commence now as to learn it by and by, to be sorry.' No, sir, I believe in show- ing my colors, and then if he gets caught, he knows that I didn't fool him. He can't be very tough, to send a chill through him so easy as that." "Wall, he ain't used to it, you know, and never was brought up to it; that makes a good deal of difference, you know. We ain't all alike, and we must make a little allowance for these little irregularities of disposition. He will have to concede a good deal, to you, and it's no more than right that you should a little to him." "Well, I won't do it; fur I'm goin' to say just what I'm a mind to; an' if he don't like it, why let him drive right along, and not stop to hitch his horse at all. I tell you, I don't believe in bein' run over by any one, an' I'll be hanged if I will; now you can just take that fur what it is worth." "Well, then, there is no use of talking; for if you are goin' to keep on in this way, I might just as well hang up my fiddle, and drop the subject entirely. But it would be all for your benefit, and I. was in hopes that I would be able to do something for you; but if you are not going to help yourself some, there is no use of my talking," he said, pleadingly.  "Well, I'll be a little better next time, an' see if that will do any good. Now, mind you want to tell him not to let me hear his sass, fur if I do, he'll get it right back with interest, now I tell you; fur I'm bound if I'll put up with it fur anybody." "That's right. I'm glad' to hear you talk'so, for now I think there is some prospect of success; for you see it's just like this, if you marry him you will have a home right here all the days of your life, and that will make you as well off as anybody." "I wouldn't be quite as well off, though, as I would if I married you, would I?"  . "No; but I ain't going to marry just now, for I have not the time nor the desire." "But wheniwill you have the time? I guess it will pay me to wait a little time." "No, it won't; for I never shall marry any one." "Why?"        160        LOVE ON THE WING.                 . "Because I don't want to, and that is reason enough, and it is all the reason I know of." She went to bed that night, and thougl the subject all over from beginning to the end, and her conclusions were in this wise: She would make Richard think she wanted him just enough to keep him from marrying any one else, and in the mean time she would try her hand with William himself; and if she couldn't get him, it would be' time enough to marry Richard after she had tried William; any way, she wouldn't marry him till she had. This was making a nice little game for Richard, and as it progresses, it grows mare and more mixed, and more and more cloudy, against whom all are plotting; but the end of it will come some time, if not till all die, and the aspirations and jeal- ousies of all are hushed in the common tomb; and it rbmains for those who come after us. to watch the result, and see if any of the parties were right, and to give the benefit of their study to the world. CHAPTER XXIV.  ISAAC, AND ELLEN, AND SARAH HOLD COUNCIL; ALSO ONE AT WILLIAM'S.                 j T  HE death of the parents of Isaac and William had caused such a mournful feeling on the one hand, and such excited hopes on the other, that it for a time threatened the stability of Isaac's reason, who, Non the very day of his mother's burial, raged like a furious lion around the little domain of his government; for he proceeded from the house, where he had vainly attempted to blow out the fulness of his wrath upon the head of his good and innocent wife, and her vain and fickle sister, for some delinquencies of duty, either imaginary or real, to the still, which he passed through in a towering rage, blowing first one, then another, of the many dependants under him, who, in dread and trembling, saw the approaching storm, and vainly tried to skulk away into some nook or corner to avoid his hated presence. Thunder echoed in sonorous tones from his mouth, and lightning flashed from his eyes, as he delivered, in a loud voice, his wicked maledictions on the head of every one. Some, less fearless than the others, called him crazy, or mad with whiskey, or conscience-stricken by grief for the loss of his  parents, which painfully reminded him of his own fate, horrid end, and    ISAAC'S WRATH.           161 certain damnation for the many wickednesses of his past life, and his own present fearful depravity. This would only cause the storm to rage with more fearful violence, which would certainly have spent itself in its fury if let alone, and allowed to pass unheeded, as it arose un- merited. Some may think this an exaggeration; but those who heard it will painfully remember, to the last days of their lives, this dreadful scene, and will now vouch for its authenticity, declaring with a shud- der that the picture is not overdrawn. How any man, endued with consciousness and apparent intelligence, can demean himself thus, while the cold remains of his mother, the cause of'his very exist- ence, lie shrouded and encoffned for burial, is beyond the feeble com- prehension of contemporaries to determine. But it must be remembered that he is a man of great and uncontrollable passions, and when once these are worked upon, as they were in this case, by causes he could not, yet vainly tried to, control, it is not strange that the volcano burst, and scattered its internal and ragged fragments of wicked words and abuse upon the heads of those around. The death of the parents had been the event, towards which the parties most interested had looked with an all-absorbing, and, as it be- came more and more near, an interesting solicitude, for it had been William's only excuse for not marrying sooner, as we before intimated; and now as the event had happened, there could be no excuse for a fur- ther delay; and as soon as the subject could be respectfully broached, it was again agitated, by being first introduced by those whose love and tender affections had not been blighted by the mournful events of the last few months. "I wonder now what excuse William will have for not making good his engagements, which he contracted so long ago?" asked Ellen, as she sat alone with her sister one evening, the children having been sent to bed. "I don't know, I'm sure, neither do I care, for I'm not going to think anything more about him; forda man who will act as he has, is unworthy of any thought save that of detestation," Sarah replied angrily, while a look of mingled scorn and forgiveness alternately swept across her face, not pale nor attenuated by either age or the sorrows of a rejected love. "O, my dear sister, don't talk so! for you don't know how unpleas- ant it sounds, and how sad it makes me feel, to think that the cherished hope of years is thus to be crushed forever, not by his own act surely, but by your own contrary, wilful nature. You know who has been the cause of this heretofore, and possibly she may reconsider,. and consent "*   162         LOVE ON THE WING. to his marrying, when all the objections to his remaining single are spread out before her; as no one can consistently, with the usages and requirements of society, keep house, and conduct so extensive a busi- ness as that which is now left on his hands, without conforming to the laws, and the expressed wishes of a respectable people; at least, not without bringing upon himself and his family scandalous reports," she thoughtfully replied. "O, well, if the cause was only removed, there might be some chance; but it isn't, neither is it likely to be, I regret to say. The death of the parents has only been an excuse to defer, with as plausible an argu- ment as possible, an event which all know should have taken place long ago; and for this reason, if for no other, I deem it impolitic to con- sider for a moment a subject which has, to my mind, been settled so conclusively as to need no further thought; for if William has no more resolution than that, no greater stamina or will of his own, than to listen to the voice of a sister, who can have no other than a vain and morbid ambition to satisfy, than he has all along manifested, then I would rather have nothing farther to do with him, as it can only result in dis- appointment to me, and chagrin and mortification to my friends," she said, with a forced-smile, evidently wishing her sister would pursue the argument, and force her against her will to accede to the proposal. "Wall, you will not object to seeing him, and, if he wishes it, to renew the old pledges of affection, which have for years lain dormant and unfulfilled?" she asked, pleadingly. "No, I don't think I would, if he were sincere in his intentions; but I object, and that too most emphatically, to being made a fool of," she replied, ironically. "About the sincerity, that you can't tell, until the fulfilment of the event itself confirms it; and as for a little innocent flirting, you can play your hand at that as well as he; so I wouldn't wait to know whether he was sincere or not, but go on, and meet him half way, and wait for the future to determine that which can be solved in no other way," she said, as a pleasant smile irradiated her face.  "Yes, I can flirt, for I've served an apprenticeship at that, and I guess by this time I have the trade pretty well learned; but the fact of the business is, it is not so pleasant to be jilted as it is to jilt your- self, and then to have it said that I got the worst of it--there is where's the rub," she said, frowningly. "O, well, I wouldn't mind about that; for you know when any one is playing with edged tools, he must expect sometimes to get cut a little, and not think the sterner sex can never avoid getting the blade   t!              HOPE RENEWED.            163 within their fingers. Pshaw! what is it? it's nothing but a game, which, if played at all, must result in one or the other being beaten; and to be beaten by him, would not be so great a defeat as to be flanked by one less worthy our endeavors; in fact, I should consider it more a triumph than a defeat to be able to cope with so worthy a foe; for you are aware it presumes a large amount of conscious worthiness to be even ranked an equal with him, by thus supposing you have a claim on his attention, as no one unworthy would have the effrontery to think that he would care a fig for one who had not the assurance to believe herself worthy all she pretends," she said, looking lovingly at her sister. "You almost persuade me to believe that I will some time be his wife," she said, her cheeks mantling with a modest flush. "I have hoped as much, yet still have fears; but I do hope you will not, by your own hasty, wilful temper upset the long-cherished desire of our lives," she said, gloomily. "You needn't be afraid that I'll say or do anything that will prevent so happy an event, for if he' really wishes to marry, I'll overlook the past and forgive him his transgressions," she replied. In a moment or so Isaac rejoined the family, and was interrogated by his wife thus :  "Have you said anything to William since the funeral about marry- ing?" she asked, with a bland smile. "No, I hain't, and don't mean to. If you or Sarah want to marry him, you can go and talk to him about it. For my part, I'm through; for it is enough to drive one crazy to say anything to him. I have a mind sometimes to take hold of him, and give him the best thrashing he ever had, he does provoke me so." "' O, pshaw! we were just congratulating ourselves with the thought that we had some one to plead our cause to him, without needlessly betraying our own wishes and hopes to him. We always thought if Mary had had some powerful ally, she might have prospered better; but no, it seems we are to be disappointed in the support of one who should feel as much interested in our projects, and in the preservation of his own good name, as we feel ourselves; and we are to lose our cause for lack of that friendly feeling and interest which a husband and a brother should manifest for those so nearly related to him, by not doing his utmost, without persuasion, to bring about that which he should hold as dear as life itself." "If you had said and done as much as I have, and been silenced into muteness by a manner as provoking as it is insolent, you would, I think, begin to feel as I do about it, and regard it the wisest course to keep   164        LOVE ON THE WING.  still, letting developments shape the future the best they can," he re- turned. ", no; that won't do. Neither do you believe it; for should a man wait for such things, nothing would ever happen for his good. He must be up and stirring, and carve out, by his tongue and energies, his own destiny, for fortune always favors the brave, while despair is the fruit of indolence." His pusillanimity thus rebuked by the courage of a woman, he, after looking in mingled awe and love into her care-worn face, though spar- kling and bright from the heroic resolution of her soul, which surged up, and found utterance in words, as truthful as they were more earnest than his own feeble yet passionate declamations, which went no farther than the ears of his auditors, and no deeper down into his own being than the roots of his tongue, he said,-  "Wall, perhaps I'll try again; but it is not with any hope of success that I do it, but to gratify your own, perverse and contrary nature, al- ways on the opposite side, and never right; for-I am fully persuaded, as I've told you, that there is no use of saying a word to him on the  subject so long as that -  woman lives to tell him different, and thwart our designs; for with him she has always had her own way, and always will. Of course 1 don't want her to die, merely to marry'Sarah to him; but if she should die in the natural course of events, why then it would be a very easy thing to get him to think just as we want him to; but now our case is hopeless." "Who would be married to-day if every one thought like that?I don't believe the question of marriage was ever proposed -every rule has its objections - when the parties were equal, that the proposer knew, to a dead certainty, that his proposition would be accepted? I never did. For my part, if I were a man, - and I feel pretty strong now, - I would not leave one stone unturned, but I would accomplish my ends. This being outwitted and flanked by a vain, conceited, pretentious woman, bah! if I were a man I should like to see the woman use me thus." "You would step without the bounds of propriety and self-respect, I suppose, to do that which not even a man would be exonerated in doing, were he anxious to forward his own nuptial projects." "No, I wouldn't. I would do nothing improper, nor unbecoming, and at the same time be applauded by every right-minded person who has the love of humanity in him, or one particle of enthusiasm to awaken. Think of the young and ardent lover as he pursues her through every difficulty, over every obstacle, his love never fli gging, his courage never   ISAAC SCOLDS HS WIFE.          165 forsaking him, until at last his efforts are crowned with the love of her who had coldly, though not sternly and absolutely, rejected him; think, will he be scorned and jeered at by his fellows? nay, but rather ap- plauded and crowned with the triumphal laurel wreath, and pointed out as an example for emulous youth to follow, and held up as a bright and shining light to cheer onward and upward those who, like yourself, are walking in indolent darkness, waiting for some good thing to turn up, which you may, by some ingenuity, twist to your advantage." "Say, by gad, I think you've gone about far enough in your criti- cism of me, madam; for I want you to understand that I know my. busi- ness, and I don't mean to allow a woman, nor anybody else, to dictate to me the course I shall pursue. I've done pretty near as I've been a mind to, subject only to the restrictions which father imposed; but now, seeing he is gone, I propose to do just as I please, anything you say, in that tone, to the contrary notwithstanding. Now, you recollect that, and it will save you much trouble and embarrassment; and when you want anything of me, ask it in a more conciliatory tone, and, if it pleases me to comply, I shall be exceedingly happy to grant any request you may make, that is, if asked in the tone and manner I've above in- dicated. I'm through with you now; not one word of apology will I hear, so you needn't look up nor attempt it. I'm not such an ass as to take in silence such reproachful language as that, especially from one who, of all others in t:.e world, should be the last to speak it. - You needn't cry, like-a baby; for it is justly yours, and more, if I heard aright, and I guess I did. I, who have done so much for you, and re- ceived so little in return! Where do you suppose you would have been, if I hadn't married you, and taken you out of the dingy place you called home, and placed you in a position to command the respect of all, and the detraction of none. Madam, if I ever hear such words again from your mouth, you may expect one of two things, either a licking, or get- ting kicked out of the house! I won't hear a word, so you needn't speak; and you can take that other bed, for I'll be bound if I'll sleep with sucl a woman, or have anything to do with her. Sarah, go to bed! What in -    are you sitting there for? By gad! I'll kick you both out doors. You're getting so infernal lazy, you can't even take care of the room you occupy. Cdme, clear out, both of you. I will clear this room be- fore I sleep a wink. Not one word; go ahead; I won't hear a word out of your mouth. Take that other bed, I tell you; for I propose to either sleep alone, or else to sleep by the side of a better woman than you are." When he first comnpenced this speech, he arose hastily from the chair,   166        LOVE ON THE WING.  and shoved it with a whack against the side of the house; and all the while he was talking he was moving around the room, replacing chairs, and kicking the footstool around to get it out of sight, at the same time gesticulating with his hands and head, to emphasize more forcibly the words he uttered. And when he saw his wife go to the bed they had so often occupied together, to get her nightgown and cap from under the pillow, where she always placed them, done up nicely togeth-  er, he thought she was going to occupy it; while she, with the hot tears streaming. down her face, replaced the pillow, and turned the covering down, and then nestled closely to her darling daughter, who, uncon- scious of all her troubles, was sleeping sweetly; and covering her face with the drapery, to hide his hated presence from her view, sobbed her- self to sleep. The morning came at last, like the mornings before and since, - bright, though cold; but to the sleepers beneath that roof, except the unconscious children, the night had been spent in fitful, disturbed slum- bers, and when the morning came, they rejoiced to think the long,  weary night had passed. At the breakfast table nothing was said, but  the eyes and countenances of each betrayed the anguish of the night. Soon it was over, and each turned to the duties before him, in a sad  and depressed state of mind. It was but a few days after the above, and while Isaac was unaware of the drift the currents were taking, and supposing his was the only and most important project anybody had in view, accosted William in the following manner:- - "Well, what do you propose doing now? I suppose in a little while you will be ready to fulfil your engagements." "What engagements do you refer to?" "Why, your marriage engagements; what did you suppose?" "I didn't know but you was referring to some business, for mar- riage I always thought of secondary importance." "Yes, I suppose so; but you will find this .is not of secondary im- portance; and if you don't attend to it in the course of six months, - I will give you till next fall, and that is long enough to mourn,- I'll sue you for a breach of promise." "Well, all right. I don't like to be sued very much, still, if I must be, why then I shall have to take it. How much are you going to set your damages at? for, perhaps, I can settle it without being sued." "We don't want your damages; all we want of you is to;marry as you agreed to." '   WILLIAM  CORNERED.         167 "Well, if you will give me till next fall, I guess I shall be able to comply." "Do you intend to marry or not? you might as well tell me, and if you don't, we'll know how to plan accordingly. I'm sure it wouldn't be discommoding you very much if you would tell truly what your intentions are." ' I think now I shall marry between this and another winter, to be frank and candid with you." "And it is your determination to marry in that time, is it?" "I may be sick and die, or she may; or I may get mittened; and there are many causes which no man can foresee and guard against that may prevent the fulfilment of so desirable an eveyh." "Such contingencies as those we all expect, at will you if none of them occur?" "For all I know of now, I think I shall be able to marry within the time you have specified." "'Then we can depend on you, and prepare accordingly, can we " "Subject to the conditions I have stated; and those are, if nothing i  occurs more than we know of now." "All right; she can go ahead and get ready again. But, say, you want to come down and see her, so as to convince her of the sincerity of your intentions. Come down to night, can't you?" "Don't believe I can come to night, for Mr. How is coming over to see about selling that lot of fifty-four acres up there by the new barn. I told him to come down to-night, and we would talk the matter over. I'll come down Sunday evening, if that will do." "Well, all right; now mind, we will expect you." And off he drove, thinking himself quite clever for having got out of it so easily. But the Sunday evening came and went, without bringing William down, and for which, afterwards, there was some loud talking, mingled with some profanity. '    c      .   168        LOVE ON THE WIN(  CHAPTER XXV.. RICHARD, WTLLTAM, AND BRIDGET HAVE A SOCIAL TALK. PROPERLY this chapter should have come in before the last; but as three chapters right along, one after the other, of the same charac- ters, would make it rather uniform and monotonous, I thought it better to introduce it further along, thus making it more varied. I omit half a dozen or more of these scenes, for the reason that I can condense the substance of them all into these three chapters, and avoid the unneces- sary delay and weariness which the reader would otherwise undergo. It was Saturday evening, and the trio were assembled in the dining- room. to engage in the play already announced. "Well, you see, Rich, I'm prepared for you," William said, as he was  settipg the glasses, and, pitcher, and bottles on the table. "' But what are you gding to do with both of these bottles?"Richard  asked, as he looked upon the scene before him. "Why, I thought I wouldn't be troubled by going down cellar with a light to draw whiskey, for you know it ain't very safe; they are both alike, and both filled alike, and you may take your choice in them. You may take the bottle, and I'll take the decanter'; or I don't care which you'take; I just as lief take one as the-other, and I'll take the decanter, and you take the bottle." "Humph! that's me,; take the crow both ways. But suppose I take the decanter, or both drink out of one till it's emptied, and then take the other; that's my proposition, and I think it's about as fair as yours; any way, I shall hardly get caught if we both drink out of one, and it will remove all suspicions of fraud." "Very well, I'm satisfied, for there is no fraud about it; but it's all fair and plain. There, you take that glass, and fix it to please yourself."  "But, say, I would just as lief pour it out for myself as not, if you have no objections." "Of course, I have no objections; but I thought it would be some trouble to you, that's all." "But, say, ain't you goin' to fix some fur me? I guess I orter have a hand in this pie, hadn't I?"Bridget asked.  "Why, of course you can have some; but I had forgotten that you ever drank," William said, as he proceeded to get another glass.   .              .             i   WILLIAM  URGES RICHARD TO MARRY.       169 "No, hold on, maybe Richard will let me have some of his; won't you Richard?" she asked, looking most provokingly lovely for her. "Why, certainly, you may have all you wish; for it ain't because I like it that I'm drinking it, but to be company for William," he replied, , as he pushed the glass towards her, which she took as gracefully as her uncouth manners would allow, and delicately sipped a swallow or two from the glass, and then returned it, with the contents not near so much lessened as Richard had wished; but he turned the glass around, and drank from the opposite side, without being observed by either. "When did you say you would have the wedding take place "Wil- liam asked, looking at Richard. "What wedding?" he asked, in surprise. "I was talking to Miss O'Conor," who, not knowing what to say, re- mained silent for a few moments, and then said, - "Why,- I didn't know as you had determined on any time yet. I left it for you to say," she replied, looking stupidly, yet confidingly, at William. "Why, I left it entirely with you to say when it should take place, and I supposed you understood it in that way," he said, bowing know- ingly; and winking sidewise from her to Richard, in order to get her to say something. He did this, however, when Richard's eyes were off from him, and but for her saying "she wouldn't do it, tell him your- self, he would not have known anything of his signs. "For my part, I hadn't even thought of a wedding yet, not even selecting the girl, much less saying a word to anybody about it. I thought you was going to give me a year to marry in. Zounds! I can't get up and marry in a day or two," Richard said, perfectly oblivious to all the signs and meaning looks which were passed between them. "O, I thought you was well acquainted with your schoolmnate, and that it wouldn't' require a very long courtship to come to an under- standing with her," William said, with a knowing smile and a sidewise bow, which Richard did not observe. "O, well, I'm acquainted with her, of course, but I never said a word to her, on that subject, and should be loath to even now, without first finding out whether she was favorably inclined in that way or not; for some girls, you know, conclude, when quite young, never to marry; and for a fellow to talk to such a one on that subject, I think it would be rather unsafe for him. don' you?" "O, I don't know. t wouldn't be criminal, neither would she be justified in using personal violence: such cases are always managed without resorting. to extreme measures." 15   170        LOVE ON THE WING. "Extreme measures! which do you think would the easiest for a man to bear, to be knocked down with a club, or have him hear that his attentions were no longer necessary or agreeable " 4  "Wall, if it was my case, I should rather hear the last than suffer the first; but I suppose you would rather take the first. It's hard accounting for tastes." "It is as true in regard to you as to me. My head would heal a good deal faster than my heart, because I could shave off the hair, and put some healing salve on it, while the heart would have to get along the best it could," Richard replied. "The heart! I never supposed you had a heart! I allus thought it was a gizzard you had, for I never heard of your'lovin' anybody," Bridget said, evidently trying to attract the gizzard towards herself, in which, however, she failed. "O, you needn't think that because he has not had two or more ro- mances in his life, that he is entirely destitute of a loving heart; for I'm of the opinion that he has, and thatj home one will yet find it, and when she does, it won't turn out to be a gizzard," William said, smiling pleasantly; and she burst out in a loud laugh, thinking she had said something sharper than anybody else. "Yes, you're allus sticking up fur the old bachelors." William was shaking his head behind the stove, negatively ; but it did not do any good, and she continued: "I never saw two such cronies in my life, and there wouldn't anybody have none of you, fur I'm sure I wouldn't." "O, yes you would. You would have Richard, wouldn't you?" "No, I n' Iwouldn't. I wouldn't have any of you." William kept on shaking his head whenever Richard wasn't looking that way, and mo- tioning a " no" with his mouth; but it was all to no purpose; she would go through With her malediction, and not be run over by any- body. "Richard, I guess, hasn't got into the old bachelor list yet, and you ought not to place him where he doesn't belong. Let me see- how old are you, Richard?" "Well, if I live twenty-five years longer, I'll be fifty years old." "Ha! no older than that, eh? There, you see, I knew he wasn't an old bachelor yet." "Wall, he will be if he waits for me to merry him, fur I hain't mer- ryin' that kind," she said, laughing out loud, while she looked at Wil- liam, thinking she had said something more remarkable than either of  the plotters; and William, to change the subject, proposed another drink, to which Richard did not demur, thinking even a drink prefer-  i   RICHARD'S SHYNESS.          171 ' able to such barefaced sarcasm. The drink was prepared, and as they were sipping it slowly, she, thinking she had made a blunder of some :i X   kind, judging from the ominous glances they exchanged, tried to repair i  .   it, by saying,- "I allus thought,: if I merried at all, I'd merry one who could sup- port me without workin' so hard as I have done, fur I think I've had my share of hard work, takin' care of your father, and liftin' your X    mother round from place to place, an' I got sick of it; an' I think now I orto have a little rest, and I purpose to get it if I can." Richard looked round in surprise at hearing such a long speech, while William, from behind the stove, tried to stop her, by making all the negative motions he could think of: but it was no use of trying; she would have her say out, and not be run on by anybody. "Here, Richard, we'll have a smoke, and talk this thing over care- fully all here between ourselves," he said, handing him a cigar and a lighted paper, which he lit by thrusting it down the lamp-chimney, after which he took another and lit his own. "Now, you see-" He stopped to blow two or three puffs of smoke from his mouth, and then said, "' It is just in this wise: you propose to marry, and move in, and take possession, as I understand it, while I take a short trip abroad. Isn't that the statement?" "Yes, you are all right; but the proposal: I haven't proposed yet, and I couldn't tell, until I held a short consultation on the subject with her, to whom I intend proposing." "O, wall, that's easy enough, for you won't have very far to go, you know," he said, looking earnestly at Richard, and then turning sud- denly in the direction of Miss O'Conor,; as if he had forgotten to look at her in the first place. "Why, it's some little distance down to Elbridge; about four miles, I believe." "That ain't very far. You can go there and back in two or three hours. You don't want a very long time, do you?" he asked, again turning his head in the direction of Miss O'Conor. "O, I shall have to go more than once, for you know a fellow wouldn't more than get acquainted the first evening; and the second he would dare hint only distantly at it; on the third he might hint a little closer  on the fourth he might hint plainly; and then get the mitten, and be told not to show his face there again. Wall, then he would have to com- mence somewhere else, and go through the same form, observing al- ways the rules of etiquette, duly made and provided for such cases. One false step might upset the plans and hopes of months. A fellow I   17'2       LOVE ON THE WING. ought to have about three years to marry in, for he must get mittened just about so many times any way; and it would be well to commence, and be very circumspect about it, for every new attempt dampens a fellow's ardor, and makes his chances beautifully less every time." "But you had better commence, in the first place, where you won't get the mitten, or where you'd just as lief get it as not, in order to make your chances more certain when you come to be in earnest, and thus save all that time, and a good many sighs, and perhaps some tears." "I don't know of any such place. If I did, I'd pitch right in there the first time." "You don't, eh? If I was in your place, I think I could determine on the locality without any trouble." "Wall, you might, for you are older, and have seen more of these things than I have." ' Wall, you may see your chance before many days." "But, come; I'm going to bed. See how late it is." "Here, hold on, and take another drink." "No, dum your drinks. I have all I want. Here, come hold that light, so I can get through this dungeon. There, that will do. Take  care of yourself. Good night." "Good night to you, and I hope you will sleep well." "Before I'd spend my time talkin' to him; fur, in the furst place he don't know nothing, in the second place, if he did, he wouldn't pretend to know nothing about what you wanted to get through him." "O, it won't do to give him up yet; .but if you would talk a little more courteously, it wouldn't be half so hard." "Wall, I can't; fur didn't I try along on the start " "Yes, you did first rate for a little while, and he brightened up a good deal then. Didn't you see how pleasant he looked when you smiled so sweetly?"  "Yes; but I can't bear to do that much, it goes agin my feelin's. I  was sorry after I did that, but I see it made a difference in him, an' if I could only have kept up that all the evening, I might make a conkest, or what is it?" "Conquest." "O, yes; I thought it was somethin' like that, but couldn't exactly tell." "Well, I wish you would try little harder next time, for if we don't make an impression on his mind before long, the game will get blocked, for all I know."                          a   ;             MMRS BENTLEY'S HARDSHPS.         173 "'hy, who will block it?" "I don't know as anybody will; but it may be a combination of cir- cumstances, over which we have no control." "Wall, let's control ourselves off to bed. If it wasn't fur that old woman in there, I could take off my shoes and stockings down here, and not freeze to death up there in the cold before I get them off." "She won't object to your taking off your shoes, and if she does, let her. I think I shall stay here yet a little while." CHAPTER XXVI. MRS. BENTLEY MOVES INTO HER NEW       HOUSE. WE will leave the trio at Nestoria to their scheming and plotting, and also the three schemers at the Hart Lot, and poor Richard to his fate, believing that he will look out for his laurels, and maintain the majesty of his own position unaided, without counsellors and with- out friends in whom he can confide, save his mother, who, weak, and with no influence, can aid him in nothing but her love and sympathy, and turn our attention to the poor widowed mother and neglected sister. Her cup of sorrow was full. She had borne, uncomplainingly, the hardships and the abuse at her brother's home, until forbearance ceased to be a virtue, and tolerance had become a crime., Although nothing had been said directly to her, yet she was subjected to little petty annoyances which disturb the peace of families, and which none but. the most vicious and depraved can inflict without feeling a pang of remorse for the helpless and dependant. She had made repeated com- plaints to her brother of the injustice done her, of the anomalous po- sition he was occupying, of the certainty of the shame and ultimate ex- posure should he persist in protecting one who had, by her outrageous conduct and indecent manners, forfeited the respect and confidence of every one. To all these he had either turned a deaf ear, or put her off with the as- surance that he would soon have things arranged, not only to her en- tire satisfaction, but also to all his friends, who, he said, were manifesting more than an ordinary interest in his welfare. Her children were denied the commonest privileges of a home, not z   174        LOVE ON THE WING. even being allowed to leave their dolls, and their dresses, and their em- broidery work in the sitting-room, where, more by accident than de- sign, they had been left, to be thrown with the sweepings into the wood-house. And little Eddy's blocks must not be left on the floor, nor in the cubby-hole, but were thrown with other rubbish into the wodd-house. His stilts and rocking-horse must not be left, where they had been allowed to remain, on the piazza, during all the time poor grandpa lived; but must be taken to the wood-house, and there left till he wished to use them, and then use them there, or bring them around to the piazza. William, in reply to such treatment, said,- "He was glad he had somebody who could keep the house in good order." At last she openly told William that she would find a place to live in the spring, and if it were nothing but a hut, she preferred it to the vexatious abuse to which she was there subjected. In reply, he said, "he would let her have a house in the spring," Accordingly, a little cottage was slightly repaired, by being re-papered and painted; and about the first of May they took up their abode in their new home, just four years from the time of their loss and bereavement. The house was comfortably, though not elegantly furnished, by William, but not without many protestations from the inexorable Irish scullion, and many little things were dispensed with on her account. Green paper curtains are good enough, and the old worn-out carpet of the sitting-room would answer for their parlor and sitting-room; she guessed they could get along without having quite so many nice things as they had been accustomed to, and for her part, she didn't want to see poor people put on a style above their means. She tried hard to have their saddles retained, as she thought they wouldn't- need them over there, because they wouldn't have any horses; but William carried his point, by saying the horses and saddles were theirs, to do with them as they wished. Then there was a terrible storm and a boo-hooing over that. She couldn't have anything; but she might work all the days of her life, and then have nothing but the rags on her back. But after a while she got over it, and the horses were kept for the girls just the same, subject to their wishes, though they had to wait on themselves. The remainder of the spring and part of summer were by her spenit in cleaning the house, and maling it as attractive as possible. It con- sisted of four rooms below and two above. One was a kitchen, and off from it a buttery, and back of this a sitting-room and bedroom. The only entrance to the house was through the kitchen. There was    X             MRS. BENTLEY'S INDUSTRY.          175 a small lean-to, which was used as a wood-house in the winter, and in the summer the cooking-stove was placed in there, so as not to heat up the house so much by the necessary culinary operations. The yard had been much neglected, for no flowers were growing there, and the leaves from the overhanging maples and elms had been allowed to accumulate, as had also the chips from the wood and brush. These she raked up and burned, and she dug up the soil and planted flowers, which soon bloomed, and abundantly rewarded her for all her pains, by their smiling beauty and sweet fragrance. The children went to the district school about a mile distant, where their mother and their uncles had twenty-five years before attended, though under far different, and more favorable circumstances. Their neighbors were a family of Carmans, whom we shall in the course of this story again mention. The place, though deprived of many of the picturesque beauties of Nestoria, still had its natural at- tractions, such as old and stately elms and giant maples, which spread their huge branches over the greensward, making the scene a humble one, and of unpretentious grandeur. The place, too, was surrounded by legendary tales; for here had but recently lived an aged matron, who had seen the Indian and his squaw seated on her step, and received from her hand the gifts of charity. The place, too, had had its modern romances, though they were un- recorded and unknown, save in the recollection of those who live around; but on its classic soil another romantic episode will take place, and similar to that of the first, though not so excusable, but with those harsh and unredeeming features, which plainly show the hand of an unskilful and unscrupulous villain, who conceived and executed, by the aid of auxiliaries, a deed of the most outrageous perfidy, and against a poor and innocent victim, who had never, in thought or deed, injured any one; and this, because of the associations of the parties will not, like its predecessors, go unnoticed and unrebuked. Mrs. Bentley, to make the'burden as light as possible on William, resolved to take in sewing, and to do those lighter works, such as nurs- ing the sick, and taking care of children, and such like. The sewing was brought to the house; and often as she sat and plied her needle the hours waxed small, and her eyes drooped heavily, ere she sought that repose which he;r independent spirit denied her. The children, all unconscious of a mother's watchful care and cease- less vigils, passed their time agreeably enough at their books, or at play; and when night came, they slept sweetly the refreshing slumber of youth. Flora felt more keenly her dependent circumstances, and   176        LOVE ON THE WING. contrasted them, with a sigh, with the elegant splendors of her western home, of which she had been so suddenly deprived; but Helen, ever gay and light-hearted, looked upon all scenes with stolid indifference, which, in one of her years, looked rather abnormrl : but, on the con- trary, it was the spontaneous offshoot of a disingenuous soul, which felt cramped in the narrow conventionalities of an aristocratic life, and longed more for the open fields, the running brooks, the lowing herds, and the natural scenes of nature, in all its unadorned and beautiful sim- plicity. Flora, though of a morose and taciturn temperament, adhered to all the forms and ceremonies of social life; and her great, proud heart was ill at ease in a dependent' sphere, and she longed for the un- restrained liberty of wealth, and the leisure and homage which are al- ways paid to those above the reach of want. Hers was the more he- roic, and Helen's the more lady-like temperament. The first you admire in trials and difficulties, the other for her gentle heart, light and airy disposition. The first would make the best wife for a poor man, the other for a rich one; for the man who married the first would die rich, if he followed her precepts, while the husband of the latter might die poor. Richard, as was his custom, counselled with his mother on his matri- monial projects. Though he had made. no sign of his knowledge of William's wishes to William, still he understood them perfectly well; nor did he say anything on the subject to any save his mother, for on her he knew he could place his utmost reliance, and not for worlds would she betray a confidence thus imposed. So one evening, as he sat and listened in silence to the hum of the teakettle on the stove, he thought of his position now, contrasting it with hopes of the future. The soft, balmy breeze of spring was war- bling gently through the leafless boughs, and rippling the bosom of the lake, which nestled between hills, and shadowed from the bleaker winds by the bordering groves of maple, spruce, and hemlock. It was a beautiful evening, with the moon looking down upon the scene like an orb of burnished silver hung in the sky, and swinging majestically through space, and watching, as it were, the thousands of lovers, as they strolled along on the sandy beach of the shore of time, or as they walked along the shore of this lake, and saw the little white-crested waves dash themselves on the pebbly shore, to be succeeded by others in the rear, always crowding forward those in front, urging them on, like man, to the end themselves too soon shall reach. Richard, being of a philosophical turn of mind, thought these things, and more, all over, when seated thus in the comfortable home of his I                         .-   AN IRISH WIFE. 1" 'youth; and as he sat there communing with himself, occasionally look- ing out of the window upon the beautiful little waves, their crests sparkling in the light of the silvery moon, he thought of many strange alas, where? No mar can tell. The Indian, too, with his squaw, had, perhaps, paddled his canoe through waves which lookedjust like those, and in just such an ecening as this, when no white man was near to :     mrdisturb the romance of his quiet life. The, too, have gone, gone beore the on-sweeping rush of civilization's mighty empire, obliter- ating every vestige of a nomadi or barbaric life, and erecting in its stead cities and monuments of the genius of a progressive age, of a more enlightened era, which, like all other terrestrial things, melt, as does the bubble on the crested wave, before the all-devouring sickle of Time. "Richard, why are you so still and sad this evening? has an ything happened of a serious nature?" his mother asked, after waiting in vain for him to say something, and at last growing impatient at his long- continued silence, had broken in upon his reverie. "O, no, nothing; but I was simply thinking and listening to the hum of the kettle and the sighing of the wind. I was thinking, moth- er, of William, who, of late, is so very good and kind to me, and his marriage projects. How would you like to have an Irish daughter-in- law?" "An Irish what?" she asked, as she started back aghast. "Daughter-in-law, I said, mother." "Why! is there danger of my having one? You are my only son, and surely you do not intend to marry an Irish wife?" "I await with impatience your wish. If you desire one, I'll marry an Irish girl." "Why, Richard, I'm astonished! I You surely don't mean what you say. You can't think of marrying an Irish wife." "Why?" "Why! How can you ask me such a question? I want you to marry a decent woman; one who will not bring discredit upon the name which has so long remained untarnisheci.", "I know of many respectable Irish girls, and who, I think, would make good wives." "Well, don't marry one of them, I beg of you, for my sake, if there are; but of the truth of which there may be a doubt. Generally speak- ing, Irish girls are not what we term respectable, still they may be ,IS           3S;,;   178        LOVE ON THE WING. perfectly blameless in their own eyes, and never have been guilty of  offences against the morals and well-being of society; still there is that something about an Irish girl which totally unfits her for the walks of social life outside her own sphere; and that something is coarseness, and an uncultivatedness which are at variance-with our ideas of social refinement." "Then you object to my marrying an Irish wife?" "Most certainly and emphatically, I do." "But what if I should fall in love with one, and marry even in the teeth of your protest?" "I'm not afraid that my son will make such a fool of himself as that; and I think he has too much pride of character to cut himself loose from family and social relations." "What! You wouldn't turn against me if I should?" "Not against you, but you will never bring an Irish wife under my roof. But what makes you think of this?" "Let me ask one more question, then I'll answer yours. Why do you hate the Irish so much?" "I don't hate them, but I don't want them in the family; for, if one did not detract anything from it, she would add nothing to it." She might add a young Irishman to it, mother, if nothing else." 4"Tut! tut! don't talk of it at all. But you have forgotten my question." "O, yes; well, I'll tell you. William has proposed, that is, he has given me to understand, by signs and hints, more plainlyunderstood than spol'en, that he would like me to marry his Irish girl. What do you think of it?" "Think of it! I hope you haven't been so long thinking about that, have you?" "No, not wholly; but it was that mostly." "Well, don't think of it any more." "But, say, mother; you haven't heard the whole." "The whole of what?" "The whole of the story."  "Why don't you tell me, seeing you set out about it " "But you won't give me a chance." "I'm waiting impatiently." "Well, hear me. He proposes, if I marry her, to give me the farm, -the Nestoria Farm, of two hundred acres, worth, probably, one hundred and fifty dollars an acre. Quite a nice little dowry to cope  with a wife, even if she is Irish. Don't you think so?" I        Z g'   K - -        TTHE CASE ALTERED. -179 Well, I must say that alters the case quite materially," she replied slowly, while the look of scorn, which had been so prominent before, was now succeeded by a smile. "Do you still adhere to your former decision " "Why didn't you tell me the whole of it in the first place and then I could answer decidedly., "Why, you can now, if you will." "I know none of her antecedents, neither her character nor disposi- tin. You know them, and you have arrived at years of discretion, and are prepared to decide such questions better than anybody else." o Why, mother! do you mean to affirm that I have arrived at years of discretion p" he asked, in blank amazement. "O but you are joking now, while I was in dead earnest." "So am I; for I seriously thought I had arrived at those years long, long time ago. How conceited I have been; and but for this casual conversation, I should still have been laboring under that vain delusion. "You can do just as you're a mind to about marrying her, for as I know nothing of her, I'm not prepared to give a final decision. Some Quite well." "What does he advise you to do?" "I haven't consulted him." "Do you mean to?" "If you wish me to I will; otherwise I'l act as you before sug- gested."                          - "It would do no harm to ask him, and you might derive some valu- able hints from him. I would ask him." ij   180        LOVE ON THE WING. CHAPTER XXVII. RICHARD, AND JAMES, AND MRS. LOVELL HOLD COUNCIL. S HORTLY afterwards James came in, and taking a newspaper, sat down by the table to read. "James, please, give me a few moments before you commence a very long story," Richard said, while a mischievous smile curled his lips. "With much pleasure; I would give the entire evening." "You know Bridget O'Conor?" "I do; but why do you ask?" "I would know what you think of her." "To use general terms, I would say that she is immodest, indecent, vulgar, profane, and lastly, though not leastly, imprudent. This I would say to no one else; neither do. I wish to have it reported that I have said it. I would not have said even this, if you had not asked me; but as a friend to a friend I have said it, wishing that no one else should ever hear of it. Is this all?" "No; I have other questions to ask; but if you are in a hurry, I will defer them until some other time." "No, do not defer them, for I have leisure, and am willing to do anything I can. But why did you ask about her? I supposed you  knew her." - "I did; but I wanted mother to hear, so she could decide with your- self the most important question of my life; and that is, shal I marry her." "Zounds! and thunder! and Mars! and Jupiter! and all the other saints! Are you crazy? or what do you mean? You surely are not in earnest about this? Marry her! Why, I would as soon put the asp of the Nile in my bosom, as to touch with the tip of my finger the hem of her poisonous garment. You don't entertain a thought of marrying the virago." "I was only talking about it, that's all; but it seems to me you are  rather harsh, rather severe, on the poor girl How did you come to know so much about her?"  "Don't ask, I beg of you; and I do hope I never shall have to tell; and what I have said about her is, I hope, between you and me; for if it goes no further I shall never be troubled."   'J4I .          A WISE DECISION.         1 181 "You have nothing to fear from me, for not a syllable of what you A-i    have said will ever be known beyond us three. I would not, for any consideration, have a word of it known, for if it was, it might bring trouble on us all; and for my part, I am much averse to getting myself mixed in this too much." -      "' ^I may have been rather more excited than the circumstances would warrant; but I was so surprised when I heard you speak of marrying her, that I, for a moment, lost all control of myself, though what I have said is perfectly true, and can be substantiated if necessary; but I hope 'it never will go so far as that, for it would reflect much scandal on all the filmily." "Well, mother, what is the conclusion?shall I marry her or not? It is for you to decide; and whatever you think best for me to do, that I will do." "If you know her to be what James has said of her, don't think any- thing more about it; for I would no more think of marrying such a woman, than I would thinlof throwing myself into the lake. I would do one as quick as the other." "So that settles the question, does it? Well, if it does, we'll think no more of it, and call. it square. It is my opinion, however, that I could not get her if I wanted to; for you see it is in this wise: Wil- liam himself is marriageable, and she may think it more desirable to marry him than to marry me: in that case I would stand a very slim chance, and only come in as second best, - not a very enviable position surely, to be held in abeyance so long, and then after all trials have failed, and she knows for a dead certainty that she never can get him, fall back on me as her only refuge and hope. Her position there will enable her to exercise a great influence over him, and as she will be with him most of the time, and that too alone, she may take undue liberties with him; and this Ja'nes's definition of her would seem to confirm the impression that she would not hesitate to do. But the discussion of this subject with us is now forever closed. I don't wish to hear it again mentioned by any one. I shall devote all my thoughts to other and more worthy subjects: and if I can get'the wife I want well and good; but I shall not get her with the intention of turning out this Irish girl, and placing my wife in her stead. I shall marry with no thoughts on that place, but bring my wife home, as if William had never intimated the subject to me. "I'm glad of it. I'm glad you have determined thus wisely," his mother said, with a smile; and they soon after retired for the night. 16   ";  *    182        LOVE ON THE WING. William, as I said before, had not only forgotten to fulfil his engage. ment to come down the next Sabbath evening, but there was one far more important than that he had forgotten to meet; and that was, the engagement to marry. He had, like Isaac Newton, forgotten all about it; and when he was reminded of it by Isaac, in language more -forci- ble than kind, he seemed to recollect, after scratching his head and thinking a moment, that he had had some talk on a subject of that nature, but it was so long ago he supposed the parties had given it all up, and didn't care anything about it. "You didn't suppose I care'l anything about it, eh? But what do you suppose I mentioned it for, if I didn't care anything about it?You are the most consummate ass I ever came across, and I'll be glad when this partnership business is closed up, and all relations with such a ver- itable fool cut off, as I am heartily sick of having anything to say or do, with or for, any such kind of man." "I didn't suppose it would make any difference, and if I had I would just as lief have come down and married as not; but I was pretty busy, and as nothing was said, I took it for granted that it had all caved in, and that nothing further was expected to be done." Isaac looked at him as if he would cut him in two; but what was the use of saying anything? The worst he could say had already been said a hundred times, and the words had no more effect than if they had been spoken against the wind. He had, however, but recently heard of his projects with Richard, and this furnished him a new handle for invective; and with it he began to lash himnright and left. "You think you are going. to get Richard to marry your dumb Irish thing--do you? But you'll find out, after you've tried a while, that he isn't marrying that kind. I should think you'd be ashamed to ask anybody to marry such a thing--lost to every noble sentiment and every womanly hope." "Don't she want to marry as well as the rest-of the women? It was a mere matter of indifference to me; but I gave it to be understood that I wouldn't put any straws in the way, if they desired to make such a contract. Aside from that I said nothing." "I should think that was enough; for what more did you want to say than that? But I'll see about this I'll see about this myself. I'll see if he is going to make such a fool of himself as to marry that infernal thing! I'll see about this -and other things, too." "Well, now, I wish you wouldn't trouble Richard, for I have had hard work enough to do already; and it will be harder, I fear, before I get through with it."   WILLIAM'S CASE CONSIDERED.         183 "Yes, I guess it will -at least, before you get him married to that thing! But if he wants her, let him have her: I won't interfere. If he wants to make an ass of himself, let him; it's none of my business." :     With that the parties separated, and nothing more was said, for the present, onf the subject between the brothers; but they both worked assiduously to accomplish their objects in other quarters. That even- ing Isaac spent with his family -not the first since the terrible rupture they had, for these squalls were quite frequent; and while they lasted, the winds beat furiously around the heads of this unhappy family. As soon as Isaac had seated himself by the stove,-not to read. as before, but to talk,-Mrs. Wood asked, more as a general question for anybody to answer than as being addressed directly to Isaac, - "I wonder if Richard will marry that Irish thing I should think he would," she said, her voice lowering as she approached the last part of the sentence. "I don't know. I wouldn't wonder, though; for the winds are always blowing somebody else good; but to me they never do. It is a very strange wind, however, that don't blow anybody any good," Sarah said. "I'll tell you, Isaac, what would be a good plan. If you could get some of the principal men in the town to talk with William about the irregularity of his position, I think it would help very much; for it certainly won't do any hurt, if it don't do any good; and no one will be any the worse for having it done, as no one in the wide world will ever think that I suggested such a thing. You see you can speak to Mr. Jones, and Mr. Locker, and Mr. Adams, and such men, confiden- tially, of course; and they, being friendly and on good terms with William, would not hesitate to oblige you, because it is not only for the good of William, and of our humble selves, but also for the good of the people and town at large; for such a scandal as this going around would not only reflect discredit on our family, but it would show also how indifferent the people were to the morals and well-being of their citizens, in permitting so gross an offence to go unrebuked right in their midst," Mrs. Wood said. Well, I fear it's all of no use now for he has hopes that Richard or somebody else will eventually marry her, and he thinks it will be all right; for nobody could say a word against his keeping a man and family -there, because, if a married man is willing to leave a young wife there and alone, why it would be nobody's business but the husband himself, who, if he was willing to permit it, could take the shame and disgrace all o0 himself. I don't know as it would be really unsafe for him to go through the streets; but I guess the boys would hoot at him   !184        LOVE ON THE WING. some, and I wouldn't much blame them if they threw stones at him, taking care, however, not to hit him," Isaac said. "But say; for fear that there is some danger that Richard will marry her, suppose you invite him down here, and we will delay it for a while, if not wholly break it up; and, in the mean time, you can try what effect the influence of others will have upon his mind," Sarah said, while a coquettish smile played upon her face.  "What are you going to do with him down here?"Isaac asked, looking at her in mingled wonder and admiration. "Why, entertain him, and make him think we are all dead in love with him, when we ain't," Sarah replied. "O, I guess you'll hardly fool him in that way! ,for he is pretty shy of women, and so bashful that he blushes when he' is in their pres- ence," Isaac said. 7 "The more bashful a man is, the easier he is captivated. All you want to do is to be pretty, and gay, and witty, and in a moment or two I can have the strongest of bashful men at my feet," she said, with a smile and a toss of her head. "Humph! you make me think of the romances in the time of the Tudors, or of the courtiers in the time of Queen Elizabeth, who were all anxious to crowd around and kiss even her slipper. When you see him kneel at the feet of any woman, call me in, and let me see it. I'll give half I'm worth to-day to see, or even hear, that he bowed before a woman."  "But you invite him down here, and I'll pledge my new silk dress that before the evening closes I'll have him tied up so I can twist and turn him as I choose round my fingers. Will you invite him " "Why, yes; but mind yon don't get caught yourself; for maybe, while you are fishing to find a heart no one has as yet discovered, you may lose your own." "It isn't so easily lost as that; and I've played this game so much, that I think I can handle the ribbons pretty well; at least, I'm not at all afraid of the result, for I think I've been pitted against as strong a foe as he is, and come off victorious." "O, well, I wouldn't do any such thing; for it certainly is not right to mislead any one when you have no sincere intentions. If Richard was a confirmed flirt himself, I wouldn't mind'so much about it; but he isn't, and never was, and never will be. What he says to a lady lhe means, and will abide by it, let the consequences be what they may; and I don't think it will be serving him right to entice him into a snare just for the fun of it. It certainly can do no one any good to see an-   A MAN'S TENDER HEART.          185 other in trouble; and Richard is just that kind of'a man, that hlen he loves, he loves with all the ardor of his soul; and if he should find that the object he loved scorned him, it might result disastrously to him or somebody else. I wish you wouldn't think of doing anything of the kind," Ellen pleadingly said. "Pshaw! What! do you want to stick up for him, I should like to know? for he isn't of as much consequence as all that comes to and I guess it won't hurt him any, for I never knew of a fellow yet dying of a broken heart; and I certainly don't believe he will, for I don't think he has one," Sarah said. "Yes, he has, and I want youl to let it alone; for you don't want it, and you may prevent somebody else from getting it, who, perhaps, would be much pleased if you kept away from him, and let that alone which you don't care a fig about getting. If you should make him crazy, you would never forgive yourself in the world -" "O, fie! don't talk of making any one crazy, for I guess he ain't so much of a goose as that yet; and if he is, he ought to be made crazy, and then he ought to go and drown himself in the lake--no, not in the lake, for that would kill all the fish; but he ought to put himself away out of the world somewhere, as being unfit to longer inhabit it. Those are my sentiments on the subject, but I suppose you think them perfectly awful; and because a' man has a tender heart, the image of a pretty woman must not fall upon it, for fear of breaking it. Such a heart as that is not worth the keeping, neither for himself nor for any- body else; and the quicker it's broken, the better it will be for him and everybody else. Will yoia invite him down, Isaac?P " she asked, turning with a look of exquisite sweetness upon him. "Yes; but you needn't go too far with him; for It won't be neces- sary, as you can keep him from her and everybody else without per- mitting too great an intimacy with yourself," he returned, smiling. "I'll see that he don't get too close-not close enough to kiss me, anyway." 16'   186        LOVE ON THE WING. CHAPTER XXVIII. CHARLES SPENCER A SOLDIER. -CAPTURE OF FORT FISIER. -HS DEATH AND BURIAL. %j %IT was a cold, blustering day in December, 1864, when the waves lashed in fury the tented shore; when the sound of the trumpet's call was heard above the roar of the surf; when the advancing squad- rons of infantry and artillery were marching to the tune of "Down in Dixie," towards the shore, where lay moored, uneasily, the transports which were to convey them to unknown shores, and perhaps to pat- riots' graves. None knew the meaning of this unusual activity. Ships' were seen far out in the bay tossing wearily upon the heavy surf, and waiting impatiently the hour of departure, to escort the transports to hostile scenes of warfare. None knew the destination, but all were eager, and they looked forward in impatience to the time when they would all be safely aboard, and on their way, no matter where, so long as it was at a place where laurels might be won and fame achieved. They were weary of the dull routine of camp-life, with its attendant hardship -the everlasting drill. Of this they were tired, and any- thing that promised relief from it was eagerly grasped. It is the most irksome feature of military life; and the soldiers had become so sick of it, that the sound of the drum or fife, which command them to parade, is like the sound of: the death knell, and they obey the one as reluc- tantly as they would the other. Even the reveille is sickening, and the soldier turns in his bunk, and wishes the drum had burst at the first tap. Soon they are all aboard, and the whistle sounds the signal of cast loose, and the whole fleet is swaying to and fro upon the deep and tem- pestuous wares of the Chesapeake. The band from the flag ship strikes up in spirited enthusiasm. Salutes are fired, and hurrahs, in deep, re- verberating echoes, are heard above the roar of the tempest - making upon the bosom of that bay amid storms and the gathering darkness, one great, grand, imposing amphitheatre. Beats there a heart so slug- gish as not to thrill with pulsations of delight and patriotism amid such stirrihg scenes, and exciting hopes? Regardless alike of danger or death, these brave soldiers push on, as cruel fate may direct, few shunning, and some courting, the enemies' missiles. Some, no doubt, are there actuated by motives purely selfish, hoping that the worst will not come to worst, but that they may be permitted to escape unscathed from the fiery ordeal. Some are there in the hopes   FLEET IN A STORM.           187 of future advancement and military glory. Some aretherefor wealth, and such look forward in fancy to the times when they can rest from their labors, and enjoy the rewards of a military life in peace and lux- ur. Some are there to fight valorously the rebel foe, nor think of danger, nor fear death, nor look forward in hopes of future aggran- *dizement. Such care nTither for fame, nor wealth, nor cast one look beyond the present. As to-dayis supplied, so will be to-morrow, so the next day, and on until death. Perhaps each is selfish in his own way. They are soon under way, and are borne with the wind, tide, and steam into the more dangerous waters of the sea. Night and dark- ness close round. The fearful wind blows the angry waves against the heavily-ladened vessels, some with living freight, others with stores and munitions of war: they groan and crack beneath the shock, and all are fearful that their graves will not be found upon the sunny hill- sides of the South, but in the waters of the deep, to be food for sharks and alligators. The storm increases, and each moment it grows more and more fierce, and seemingly determined to wreck the whole fleet. The storm and the elements are in league with the foe, who are pray- ing to their God, on their hended knees, and in humility, and meek- ness, and repentance, and hearts contrite, to save them from the avenging fury of the advancing fleet: and this wind and storm they think are in answer to their petition. The ships are separated, and each steers his own course, to buffet with the angry waves alone. Some steer for deeper waters, and there go down to rise no more, until the archangel's trumpet, sounding from mid air, and borne aloft on angel's wing, shall summon them to appear before the General of all armies and all people. Some, more timid, hug close the shore, and there are dashed against the proJecting rocks, and sink with their vessel, or clinging to some spar or plank, are wafted on to deeper and more dangerous places, or are drifted to friendless shores, and there meet imprisonment or death. Some, meantime, kneel in fervent prayer to God, that He would still the fury of the storm, or give them  strength and courage to ride it bravely through. Some, in despair of hope, or succor, or an abatement of the storm, cry aloud in the anguish of their spirit, and wring their hands, or tear their hair, at the thought of being thus compelled to yield a life they had devoted to the good of their country's cause. To die thus, struggling with the waves, on that dreadful night, instead of fighting bravely with the foe, and dying there on the ensanguined field, as became men and patriots, was more than their brave spirits could endure, and they sunk within them, despairing. Some, perhaps, instead of praying, were cursing   188        LOVE ON THE WING. that God whom their more devout companions sought in vain to ap- pease-calling on Him to sink them there outright, and not torture them in the smothering waves. Some were cheering, with hopeful words and lively manners, those whose courage had forsaken them; but their wprds fell upon deaf ears, or were drowned in the fury of the tempest. On some ships there was neither order nor discipline, but all obeyed their own behests, and did, or left undone, that which all should have been united in performing. On other ships more order prevailed, because of the severity of the commander, or because of the love in which he was regarded. Commanders of medium qualifications had no authority there, and all was in confusion, as each expected every moment to sink beneath the waves. No lights could be seen from the other ships because of the impenetrable darkness, for many ran close beside each other, nor knew they were so near until convinced by actual presence. Towards morning the fury of the storm subsided, and the sun rose, and smiled upon the scene; yes, smiled benignly. The wreck was great. Spars, fragments, planks, and even floating swimmers could be seen on every hand. Some were clinging to planks, and some kept themselves afloat by their own now nearly exhausted energies. These were rescued, and placed under medical treatment, to afterwards die, or. be crippled for life. Four ships were. lost, besides much freight, which was thrown over to save the ships. The scattering ones were soon gathered together, and they proceeded on their journey without any further delay. Not until they were out to sea were they allowed to open their or- ders; but when night came on, and the storm, their time was all con- sumed in keeping themselves afloat; consequently no one knew where he was bound until morning, when they all assembled under the con- voy of the men-of-war, as if they would shield them from the further injury of the elements. They proceeded on the remainder of the journey rejoicing, and they arrived at their destination early on the morning of the 24th December, 1864. It was the reduction of Fort Fisher. The water was shallow, aid the fort could not be approached except by land. It was the key to the gates of North Carolina, which, when once in our possession, would enable us to march undisturbed into the heart of the enemy's country. It had to he assaulted by land, and a company of marines was detailed, protected by light artillery, and the gunboats in the bay, to reduce the fort to subjection. They disem-   CAPTURE OF FORT FISHER.          189 barked, and proceeded, first slowly; and finally, with deafening shouts, colors flying, and the band cheering, they began the furious charge. The fort seemed doomed from that moment, as onward the furious soldiery flew, as if nothing could check the terrible onset. Victory seemed within their grasp, and without the firing of a gun, so still and expectant the crouching foe behind the walls remained. Not a word was spoken nor a whisper, but onward, and still nearer, the victors approached, until within a dozen yards, when a stunning fire was opened upon the defenceless column, and it melted from sight. But few were left of that gay and ambitious company which but a few moments before went marching away to the sound of cheering notes, all expecting the fort and en6my were theirs, while future rewards, in the shape of glittering tinsel or wealth, were already within their grasp. How fickle and uncertain are all earthly wishes! Health, happiness, even life are sacrificed, in the hope of future greatness or glory; and the sweet prize of a perishable immortality is not dearly won, even at so costly a sacrifice. The vanquished return for re6nforcements of men and cannon, and again they set out, determined to reduce the proud foe to subjection or die. The shouts of applause and congratulation had hardly died away, when another, a stronger, a more resistless force came sweeping across the plain. A shout, which sent a death knell to the hearts of the foe, but was music to the ears of friends, went up from that advancing host, and it seemed to rend the heavens in twain with its fierce, vengeful cry. A rush - and such a rush! no earthquake ever trembled more, or sent such terror to the hearts of men. They stood appalled, and gazed in wondering dread on what was to the rebel foe but a column of death, which in its resistless course, would sweep them from earth. A discharge of musketry, the booming cannon, the hissing shells, the fiery missiles, and all was still and quiet as the grave; for lo! there appeared the signal of surrender in the place where, but a moment be- fore, proudly fluttered in the breeze the Palmetto flag. The fort is won, and the victory is ours. But at how dear a cost! What brave soldiers had fallen? We shall see. The dead, the honored dead, were there interred, or by fricnds we-e brought away to be interred with more fitting honors, more worthy ceremonies, by their sorrowing relatives at home. The news of the capture of Fort Fisher was heralded throughout the North, and by many received with shouts of joy, but by others in so,- row; for it had been reduced by the sacrifice of some cherished son or brother, which no victory, however great, could ever again return to the embrace of those they once so dearly loved.   190        LOVE ON THE WING. A gallant captain had fallen on the first disastrous charge, and his re- mains were on their way home, to be interred by the side of relatives, and in the tears of parents, and a loving sister, and a host of friends. They arrive in the beautiful village of Skaneateles amid the tolling of bells, the muffled sound of drums, and the stifled sobs of relatives. The procession moves on slowly, and in sadness, to his former home, where a few remarks of an eulogistic character, then a prayer, and a hymn, and the brave soldier is borne away to his quiet home. In the pocket of his coat was found, among his other papers, the following letter:- \i L SARAAd: *c FORT MONROR, December 17, 184. "SARAH: "When you read these lines, I shall be no more. The life which was freely and devotedly offered to you, and by you accepted, and then by you spurned, is now to be given to the cause of our beloved coun- try. I shall seek Death in the foremost ranks, in the hopes of there finding him. I would have been glad to live, if in the sunshine of your smiles, but without you, all is dark and dreary, and death is far prefer- able to such a life. Not one happy moment have I seen or enjoyed since the fatal evening of our most cruel separation. I thought and hoped my prayer of entreaty to you would make your heart relent, and receive me back again into favor. I hoped you would write me a word, saying, 'I forgive all, come back again.' Daily I went to the office, thinking to find there a letter from you, But, no; I was doomed to disappointment again and again. Could it be I merited this, I would without a pang have yielded my life before. But you might have been hasty, and I guiltless. No, it could not be thus. I believe I am wrong, and you are right, and my sentence just, and my doom decreed. En- closed you will find a lock of hair you used to twine so lovingly around your fingers. Keep it, Sarah, keep it in remembrance of. one who loved you much, who loves you still, and will continue to love you on forever.

It was shocking to see how frantically some of the poor men raved. Some cursed their God, whom they should have addressed on bended knees, and in supplicating voice, to spare them from the fury of the storm; while others prayed, prayed too, devoutly, that He would look in comrn passion down upon us, and forgive our many transgressions; to open the hearts of sinners and let salvation in; and to close their mouths against such execrations. Many were the tears I saw shed, and none more freely flowed than mine. But why? 'For myself? Nay. For myself not one thought was ever given, and I cared not whether the sea opened that instant and swallowed us all.

I thought them once so pure and sweet, that I was glad to press them to my lips; but now, whoever kisses them will taste my blood, and it never can from them be removed. My turn has come to go, and I must follow. When next you see, or hear from me, I shall be no more. So, Sarah, from the grave I speak it, farewell! My love to you, to all, everybody.

Mrs. Bentley was a very good nurse, and was much sought for by those who needed such assistance. She even went into the adjoining towns, and did far more by her tender care, warm and genial spirits, towards restoring the patient, than did the medicine she administered; and especially was she a great help to children, for whom, and their suf- ferings, she seemed to manifest so much sympathy; and as she bent over the feverish patients to smooth a pillow, or rearrange the disor- dered covering which would occasionally become displaced by the quick, impatient movements of the patient, the lines of sorrow could be distinctly traced upon her pallid brow; and often a tear glistened on the ends of the long silken eyelashes, and then disappeared by drop- ping, or by evaporation in the warm and over-heated room. She had been a constant attendant upon the sick,'among many near and distant families, for over a year, and the constant attention, and the air of feverish apartments, had removed the color from her face, and it had become attenuated, and a hectic glow burned in unnatural brightness upon her cheeks-; but something must be done, and duty as well as pride directed her in the course she was pursuing. She was admonished that these continued labors would yet bear her down, and if she wished to be a mother to her children she must cease to work so assiduously. She had supported her entire family, since she had been away from Nestoria, with the help of her garden, which was very pro- ductive, and was more than sufficient for her wants. William always called to see if anything was required, on his way to and from his business; and, seeing all comfortable and happy. with a plenty of the necessaries of life, he went his way rejoicing, because it was not costing as much as he feared, while peace had, since her de- parture, reigned only in fitful squalls, whereas before it was a continual. storm, broken only by the casual breaks in the domestic clouds, through which the sun would shine for a few moments, and then disappear. He saw the continued change in his sister's wan and care-worn-face, and remarked, with a sigh, " that she was looking more and more ill each time he saw her; and that if she did not discontinue her useless, sleep- less work she would be sick, and then who would take care of her'? You ought for your children's, if for no others' sake, guard your health with the utmost care, as sonmething more sacred, even, than duty. It is not your own to thus throw away; and you are not compelled to do it, for we will supply all your wants, and see that you need nothing." To all such prayerful and earnest entreaties she turned a deaf ear, only saying, " she must do something for herself, and not be a burden   NURSING AT MR. BROWN'S.         193 on the charity of her kind relatives, to whom she was already indebted for many favors she could never hope to return; she could only pray that the blessings of a kind Providence would be showered upon them, in the same measure she had received, nay, even more; and if prayers are of any avail, the rewards which many shall receive will not be small, nor less than they deserve. You have been kind to me, but you could have helped me more if. it had not been for the unfavorable cir- cumstances in which you were placed, and which no persuasions would induce you to forego; but for what I have received, accept my warm- est thanks, my earnest wish that you may yet see the folly of your course, and my prayers which daily arise from a penitent heart to the ears of Him who never sleeps." William brushed the mist from his eyes, and, after a few common- place remarks, bade her good morning. Time wore away, and Mrs. Bentley, partially taking the advice of her friends, had resolved to gtay at home, and recuperate her declining health, peremptorily refusing many invitations to go out nursing; but when Mr. Brown came, and representing that his child, a girl of four years, was suffering much for need of attendance, as her mother was also sick, and unable to perform the necessary housework, she relented so far as to go over for a day,. and then return; ," because," she said, ", mv own health is much shat- tered - by constant and confining duties in the sick-chamber, and prudence demands first that I should be nursed instead of nursing." After a few hasty preparations, she accompanied Mr. Brown to his home, and found his daughter suflbring from symptoms of scarlet fever. She took hold and did all she could for the sufferer, and then turned her attention to clearing up the house, which had been sadly neglected for the past few days, as was plainly to be seen after she had taken a hasty survey of the place. The breakfast-table was uncleared, which was only pulled out from the wall sufficiently to allow the opposite leaf to be raised, and without the table-cloth. Here were the frugal remains of the morning's meal, with not only the dishes to wash, but also those which had accumulated during the last day or two, and which had been laid away in the sink. The contents of the cupboard had been ransacked by the two mischiev- ous boys. The pots and kettles were pulled out, and the dish with the suet for greasing the pan-cake griddle, had been used for greasing their boots. The preserve jars had been opened, and the preserves drizzled down the sides and had dropped on the shelves. The sugar-box was found, and partially rifled of its contents. The boxes containing the soda, and allspice, and ginger, 'and pepper, and the raisins were all 17   194        LOVE ON THE WING. examined and tasted, the best approved, while that which was unpal- atable was pushed back. She put things to rights as well as her limited time would permit, for she determined to return home the next morning, as Mr. Brown had promised to bring her back then, and it was on this condition alone that she consented to come. She found the work very tiresome to her, as she had been unaccustomed to such hard work, and its effect upon her nervous system induced a languor and a depression of spirits which caused her to succumb even before her task was completed; for between her two patients, she found little time to attend to the equally necessary duties of the kitchen, and it became more and more impos- sible to work, as she each moment became less strong and active.  The morning found her, if anything, more sick than her patients, but as she must get home, she nerved herself to endure it with an exertion of her 'ill, which had heretofore never failed her. She reached home, and found that the air and the ride had produced a very good effect upon her health, and she felt much better after she arrived than when she started.  Little Eddie, who had never been sick, had of late been complaining i of aches and pains, and which made him more uneasy and more diffi- cult to please, because he had never before endured them, and he didn't know what such things were; but now he was conscious there were such things as aches, of which his mother had often complained; but which he thought were more imaginary than real. He pitied her now for what she had endured when he thought them mere whimmish notions, which would in a few moments pass off. He is now seven years old; a bright, rosy-faced, intelligent little boy, quick to learn, an adept at mim- icking the frailties of humanity, those of style and manner rather than those of the body, which he knew could not be helped. His light, boyish antics, which his mother permitted in the house, even when her head was aching as though it would split right open, humoring him to that extent that every step on the floor, or a word spoken too loud, pierced her through like an arrow, still she would not disturb him in his play, for fear it might pain or grieve him more than permitting it Would her. She would rather suffer herself, than to allow a moment's happiness to escape her children. Eddie was not very sick, though it was evident he had the scarlet fever; but he was up, and around, nearly all the while; for his mother could not get him to remain in bed but a few moments at a time, be- fdj he would be up again.; and though not as active, would busy him- self smith his knife awhile, and then turn to the rocking-horse, which he would ride only for a moment, and then seek out some other amuse- - a   SICKNESS OF EDDIE BENTLEY.   .     195 ment. In this way the entire week was spent, the doctor only coming once, and then he thought he had better prescribe something for the mother rather than for the boy, who, he said, would get along with- out any more of his attention. Eddie was getting along finely, and the only care to be required was to keep him in the house, to prevent his taking cold, which is, perhaps, worse than the disease itself. His mother had all she could do to keep him in the house; and on one or two occasions he did get out when her attention was turned to something else for a moment or so. lie even went as far as the gate one morning, when she was feeding the pig; and there being some dew under the trees, his feet were dampened, and he caught cold. This brought him right down, making him much worse than he was before; and Mrs. Bentley being frightened, sent at once for the doctor, while she soaked his feet in warm water, and then in rubbing them with a towel rubbed the skin all off. This she knew was alwafys the case in fevers of this kind; so she went on, and put him to bed, covering him up warm and nice, and then awaited in anxiety the coming of the physician. During all this while she was talking and blaming herself for having been so negligent as to permit him to go out, thinking she had been very remiss; though she had been as par- ticular and as stringent as most mothers would be; yet towards the last, when all danger was seemingly passed, she might have been more lax than she ought. The doctor came, took the haiid, and found the fever running high. He gave him some medicine with a trembling hand, and the good mother, as she watched the drooping boy, lowly asked,-- - "Will he live, doctor?" "Wall, I don't know; I have seen patients recover when they were as low as Eddie is, but the diagnosis is now unfavorable. I will, how- ever, do all I can." He sat a while, and told all the news of the village, and tried hard to get some from her; but she was so bowed down with grief for her boy, she could only smile reluctantly at his quaint jokes. but deigned no reply to his questions, except those she could answer in monosyllables. He shortly after left her with her boy alone in her sorrow, for the girls were at school. Alone, through that long wear) night, she watched by the bedlside of her son, hoping and praying that he would live. The gentle breeze murmured softly through the chinks and crevices, nor did it awaken her to a sense of the stillness without, for nothing was heard save the breeze, which felt warm, and smelt of the balmy south, as if it were the breath of Nature.   i  z 96          LOVE ON THE WING. Days and nights passed drearily along, but she would permit no one to sit up nights in her stead, nor take her place during the day, while she might, if she would, take a little rest; but she would not hear it, so she continued to do nearly everything alone that was to be done about the bed of suffering, each day making it more apparent the little sufferer could not live. His sisters came around him weeping, which, when he saw, he asked "what the matter was, and why they cried so?" and they said, "Because they feared he would die." "O, no; I won't die, will I mamma? You won't let me die, will you, mamma? No; I knew you wouldn't. There now, don't cry any more; for mamma wouldn't let me .die." "O, dear Eddie! mamma can't help it, and if she 6ould she would. Yes, dear brother, doctor says. yop will die," said little Flora, between her sobs and tears, and she kissed the feverish lip. "O, dear Eddie, I'm so sorry! You will forgive me, won't you, for breaking the ear off your horse? I didn't mean to. Please, Eddie, for- give me," and little Helen looked into his jolly face to see if her for- giveness was there ere the dying brother answered. "O, yes, certainly; I had forgotten about that; but don't think of it any more: and if I die you may have him, or give him to Jim Jones. He hain't got any horse, and he said he liked mine so much." "But I wish you wouldn't die, I love you so much; and I never thought before how much I do love you, I was so busy; but I do love you, Eddie, ever so much," said Helen, sobbing and crying most pit- eously, and she, too, kissed the feverish brow on which stood large drops of sweat. It was the seal of Death, and he was already lapping up his youthful life; and as they all stood around watching, as it faded slowly away, they wept and moaned, and wished he would not die- wished even against hope, against what they were certain would hap- pen. It was not the dying scene of one feeble with the infirmities of time or palsied with age, but it was the light of a life which had hardly yet begun to burn. It was as the bud just opening into life and ma- turity, of whose beauty and fragrance none had yet seen, but of whose usefulness all had hoped. All the hopes of a fond and indulgent  mother, in whom the prayers of years were centred, over whose infancy she had watched while others slept, whose care had been to her a blessed privilege, whose training had been to her solicitous as well as amusing, whose education had been conducted in the hope and belief that one day he would become a useful if not an honorable member of society, a glory to her, and an honor to all, lay on that pillow just breathing out his life.   EDDIE'S DEATH.           197 197 'O, mother!w hy do you all stand around, and not lift a hand to help me?Can't you hold me, mother, and keep me back? There, let me lay my head on your nice, soft bosom; there, no one can hurt me now. You will keep me back, won't you, mother? and not let them take me away. There, mother, please cover up my feet, they are so cold. What makes you cry so hard, mother? Your tears drop on my face." "O, my dear son! I prayed to God, that he would spare my son, but He either did not hear, or else He thinks it best. Thy will, not mine, O Lord, be done. It is too hard to yield, to give up all hope and trust in God, and believe that He has not forsaken us in our distress, or seek such consolation which alone can be found in prayer; but prayer, without hope, what is it?" "See, mother! Quick! here's the bowl, the fan, or what do you want  He faints! O, mother, can't you do anythng? How he strug gles! Such spasms. O, mother! do help him, do! O, how horrid it is to die! And this is death! See, he gasps! There, he is going to speak; no, the effort died! Yes, he will speak. O, could I hear only one word now! I'd treasure it up forever. But no, he won't speak! Do, Eddie! Speak just once! He breathes long and slowly! His eyes do open, and he turns to see his mother; then faintly whispers, O, dear mother! it is so hard!' There, poor Eddie is dead."     His mother laid him gently back, and closed his eyes, and shut his mouth; and then they laid him out, and dressed him in his Sunday clothes for burial. As he lay encoffined for the grave, in that lone house, that sad, mournful evening, even little Helen forgot her light, fickle nature, and did weep. She wept bitter tears of sorrow, too, that came from her innermost soul, and seemed'to press her down, so heavy was her grief and so light and frail her frame. Flora was inconsolable for the loss of her brother, her only brother, and another she could never have. It was a loss that few could suffer, and not feel; it was a loss that a mother could not suffer, and not mourn; and it is a loss that none can endure, without raising them to heaven; for after such a treasure the mind doth follow, and rest con- tent when it is known, or believed that the loved is happy. "The knell, the shroud, the mattock, and the grave, The deep, damp vault, the darkness and the worm." There is where they laid little Eddie, in the cold, damp ground, to be food for worms and crawling insects. All there was of him, all we could see and know, was thus laid away; but a brighter, purer, better part went up to Him who gave him life; for He who gives, hath the 1power to take. 17'   198        LOVE ON THE WING. CHAPTER XXIX. ISAAC INVITES RICHARD.--ISAAC ENGAGES THE INFLU- ENCE OF OTHERS. SAAC saw Richard a few days afterwards, and as Richard was very fond of books, said to him, "I've a nice library down home. Come down some time, and we'll look it over, and if you find anything you like you can take it. I shall be at leisure Sunday. Can you come down on that day?" he asked, eyeing him askance.  "Yes, I guess so. What have you? the Life of Christ?'" "Yes, and you-may take it, if you want it." "Wall, I'll come down and see." "All right; come down," and he drove off laughing in his sleeve, while Richard was all unconscious of the game that was being played; and as he had taken the trouble to invite him, he would go, of course, and see what was wanting. He may have had some slight suspicions, but the motives he could not divine; for he knew well all the antece- lents of Sarah, as they had known each other from childhood, and had attended the same school. It could not be they entertained any de- signs upon him, that is, real designs; for she would never consent to live in the house of one who had jilted her. Then of course she didn't want to marry Richard, unless, indeed, they struck off for themselves; and he would rather demur at that, in view of the tempting prize already within his grasp. Then what object could he have for inviting him down there to see books he never had thought to let him see before? There must be a snake in the grass; but as Richard was a courageous fellow, he determined to go, resolving, however, that if there was any picking, he would get a luncheon while the rest were getting a meal. It wouldn't do any hurt to go and see, and if there was fun for them, why wouldn't it be fun for him? So in fun he played his part of the game. As the plot progresses, it will be seen plainly what were Richard's designs. He weighed these things in his mind alone, unaided; and for this reason, as well as not to forestall the conclusion, letting the reader come to it as he goes, we have refrained from giving the advice and counsel he asked of his mother and his friend James regarding his future best course. If it had not been for the fact that she, that is, Sarah, was try-   !ISAAC AND MR. LOCKER.          199 ing to marry William herself, and of this Richard knew as well as they, but said nothing, Richard might have entertained a hope that she would be willing to accept a position as a wife of Richard, and a bachelors housekeeper; but of course she wouldn't marry the best mal in the world who would look for a position under him. After having warned Richard to appear before the goddess of love, and beauty, and flirtation, to receive a smile of favor, or his sentence of disapproval, Isaac betook himself to other labors. He had not yet so- licited the cooperation and influence of his wealthy townsmen in the prosecuting of his matrimonial schemes, and so thinking he had noth- ing else to do, he would saunter around the village, as if by accident, and encounter one by one of those whose opinions would be likely to have a little weight on the mind of his obstinate brother. Mr. Locker being most in town, he saw him first, and, addressing. him politely, sajd,- - "I say, Mr. Locker, this i o   c a fine day." "Well, yes, rather," looking up towards the sky. "Any word to-day from the war " "O, yes, the rebels fast retreating before our victorious armies and valorous generals, and Lincoln killed." "Yes, I heard-; how sudden it was!" "Sudden as a clap of thunder out of a clear sky." "It did electrify the nation." "How do you know that?" "Can't I read?" "Not that, unless some fool wrote it." "Why, don't the people mourn " "The people have mourned for fools." "Ha! he was no fool. You disrespect the noble dead." "Dost know how the people glorified live Antony, and how they did abuse and vilify him when dead, because his conqueror was there?" "But say, enough of this jargon, and let us to business." "You have business?I'm for that, if anything can be made of it for me, if not, I'd be better employed." "You are a friend." "Of him who pays me for being one." "And no one else " "I shouldn't like it so well." "But I've business that should concern you as well as me, although no profit will accrue to either."   200        LOVE ON THE WING. I've a few moments,- tell it." "You know my brother?" "Ha, well! and a right good fellow he is." "I would have him marry." "Whom?" "No matter then, or now." "You speak sarcastically, sir."

"Now, I'll find Mr. Jones, and see if I can do as well by him; but it will be dear business for me if I don't gain it. Gain it! I must, and shall." He went to the hotel, the post-office, and all the groceries and grog-shops to find Mr. Jones. He wasn't in town often, blut when he was, he waas to be found in' one of these' places.' At last he saw'him walking up before the stores, his long coat-tail flopping up behind at every step he took, because hisheel hit the fla. He is a short, thick- -set, duckylooking fellow, and if he had relied exclusively on his own genius, would, perhaps, have been a great man. Halloo, there, Jones! I wan't to see you a moment." "Ha! Good morning, Mr. Wood," shaking hands. "Good morning, Jones; I'm glad to see you." "This is a lovely morning. I've my barley sowed." "Ha, indeed i you think early sowing produces the best crops? "Yes, and to be first is a consideration." "I suppose so," he said, looking down. "You said you wished to see me." "Yes; I had forgotten. You know my brother?" "Your brother?Ha, ha!

"For how much? - that id, how much do you want?" he asked, again fumbling his pockets, and moving around impatiently. "How much what?" "Monev." "I don't want money; it's counsel, influence, I want." "How much will it be worth?"  "To whom? Hold! Wait till I'm through, and then speak. I would have my brother, and I thought if influence could be had suffi- cient, he might think as others think, and marry, as becomes a man and a gentleman, and not disgrace himself and his noble family by keeping an Irish wench." "I understand; you wish your brother to marry; but to whom?" "No matter of that now, nor hereafter.

"There is no law to punish wenchery without arrestment, and that would entail disgrace upon her and him," he said, bowing short, little, knowing bows at almost every word,   RICHARD AND BRIDGET.          205 "I want to marry him respectably, and kick her out."

"Sometimes, for a friend, and when no one will be advantaged." Will not the one who marries him be advantaged?" "if she be needy, yes; if she be rich, no." "Which of the two will he marry?" "The former." "Then she might, if I help her to a goodly heritage, remember in gratitude him who befriends her, and who caused her to be the recipient of a princely sum.

RICHARD -   HS MANNERS AND HABITS. Soon as it was whispered around among neighbors, acquaint- ances, and friends that it was proposed to marry Richard to Bridget, and for the twain to take care of the large estates of William when he was off, and when he wasn't, various were the surmises as to the probabilities of Richard's willingness to accept so disagreeable a woman, even for the valuable consideration which was offered with her. Every one watched with a' curious eye the development of events; some hopefully, and some fearfully, that he would. All thought that he ought to do better; still, if he was satisfied with her, no one would object, ',18   206        LOVE ON THE WING. for it was his business and his alone. And many wondered how he would manage it, in case he didn't wish to comply; but the time rolled on, and he had not married yet, and each day made it more and more certain that Richard's heart was not there, and was not likely to be. She had told among her friends that she could marry him whenever she wished; and, in fact, all who said anything to her on the subject obtained all there was to be learned, because she felt as if it weread- vancement which her more unfortunate sisters would sigh for in vain; consequently all knew, from the least to the greatest, that she was will- ing to marry Richard after she had become positively convinced that she could not marry William. After a few years it began to look to her a little uncertain about marrying William; and when she came to exe- cute the threat she had made against Richard, and that was to marry him whenever she wished, it began to look rather uncertain about get- ting him; and this uncertainty will become more plainly established as we progress, when more objections will suddenly loom out on the hori- zon; and these objections, unlike those we have enumerated, will be more difficult to surmount. Since William had proposed the subject to Richard, he had been very assiduous in his attentions to the youngladies, and he had spruced up his rough exterior very much, not even wearing his pants in his boots, as he had always been accustomed to do. The old patched coat was thrown aside, and a new one bought, while the old slouched hat, which had done such faithful service so long, was discarded; and you, would hardly believe what a vast difference it made in him, and every- body remarked it as he passed to and from his work. The same change took place in the room he occupied, and he allowed his mother to put his shirts and stockings in the drawers, to put his papers, which were lying around on the table promiscuously, into the paper bag. His fish-lines, bait-boxes, minie-sack, powder-flask, shot- horn, gun-caps, and his gun found better places, not quite so handy,. but more tidy. He had always objected to having anything disturbed in his room, for he never could find what he wanted when anybody had been rearranging what he had purposely left handy. He didn't care how nice and orderly other parts of the house were, but that place was his sanctum, and devoted exclusively to himself. His clothes had al- ways been left undisturbed where he had thrown them, -on the wash- stand, across the chairs, and on his trunk; but nowthey were all picked up anJ hung in the wardrobe, and the room presented altogether a dif- ferent appearance, hardly recognizable as the one he had formerly oecx,   RICHARD'S AWKWARDNESS.          207 pied. The windows were uncurtained, and the blinds of one usually open, and which were not closed on his retiring for the night; but, as was his custom, he came in hastily, and doffed his coat, and threw it across a chair, or, in winter, laid it on his bed, and hung his vest on the back of his chair, and dropping his pants down, blew out the light, not caring if all the town were gazing at him through the window. But now, the blinds were closed, and the curtains drawn, and he wondered why he had been so negligent as not to think of these things before. He didn't blame the ladies for being so shy of him, as he had so glaringly paid no heed to the commonest requirements of social life; at he would amend, and be better, more courteous, and observing. He would not neglect those little social civilities which, while they cost nothing, leave sunshine behind. He had called on some of his most intimate lady friends, and, after an embarrassing and unsatisfactory interview, blushingly withdrew to his den, there to think and regret his awkward manners, which had, unfortunately, caused him many a blush. But this was gradually wearing off, as he became more familiar with the secret workings of a woman's heart. It was slow; and many a night he passed in sleeplessness in devising ways and means to overcome his bashfulness, and ingratiate himself in the good graces of those whom he worshipped, but dare not address. He knew it was his own fault, and he knew when he made a mistake, and others did, for the crimson color mantled in a fiery glow all over his face. Sometimes, too, the girls teased him on purpose to see his confusion and embarrassment; but he never blamed them, for it was all his own fault, he knew, as such good angels could be guilty of nothing wrong, while he, a sim- pleton and a goose, could do nothing right. He wouldn't, if he were in their places, have anything to do with such an awkward thing; they didn't want to blush, nor cause their friends to blush, because of his droll words and uncouth manners. His coarse, rough manners could never affinitize with their fine and delicate natures. He was about to give up in despair, and let the wife-hunting business go, leaving those to marry who had served an apprenticeship at the trade, for he was getting too old to learn one now, as he would be beyond the marriage age by the time it was completed. He was in hopes some friend would help him out of the trouble, by standing between him and the offended fair ones to explain his diffi- culties to them, and mollify their displeasure, in the wish that one of the many would receive him again into favor. He thought of his mother; but she only laughed at his fears, and told him to go on, and not think of himself, but to keep his attention fixed on the train of con-   208        LOVE ON THE WING. versation and the answers he ought to make Sometimes, before call- ing on a lady friend, he would study during the day the words he would use in the evening; and then he approached the gate with much more confidence, not going backwards and forwards in front of it as he had sometimes done, doubting whether he had better go in or go home. But when he came to think of the language he had studied over with so much assiduity, thinking it so fitting and appropriate, it all forsook him, or, the conversation drifting into other channels, could not be applied, unless, indeed, he boldly turned the subject, and introduced it himself; and such a state of things made it a good deal worse for him, than if he had come right into the parlor and relied exclusively upon the exigencies of the occasion for the words he used; for the words not coming to his support in time to meet the joke, and clinch it with a witty repartee, he had to stop and think up one. Ho didn't know what a figure he would cut before the gay, fastidious, and critical Sarah; but as he had met with indifferent success before, of course he didn't expect to make any impression there. She being so pretty, and gay, and accomplished, he didn't know but it might be an advantage to him to see her, even if he was as unlucky as he had been; and she might, knowing his weakness, be more lenient and merciful to him, and not blush when he blushed, but turn it off quickly by some well-timed remark, which would turn his confusion into mer- riment, and his far-fetched, inapplicable words into language sparkling with wit, humor, and good sense. She could not possibly use him worse than he had been, and she might who knows?- use him bet- ter; he would see and know the worst; it might wound, but it could not kill him. So one Sunday, towards the spring of 1865, he strolled along through the snow, for no conveyance could be had of William to go so far away when there were so many right around home; but he didn't see any round home, and so he preferred going a-foot to not going at all. As he went, he speculated upon the chances which were in his favor, and the odds that were against him, and the latter preponderated. * Of course I go," he soliloquized," prepared to meet with disappoint- ment; and if I meet with success, I shall be pleasurably surprised." He met Isaac in the office, who received him with a good-natured smile and a bow, and after offering him a chair, engaged in a desultory conversation until tea-time, when he arose and invited him in. Richard followed, but trembled in every joint, while the crimson color came and ;i went, like quickly-flying clouds before the sun. He entered the room, after the unceremonious Isaac, who walked as boldly as if going through   RICHARD AND SARAH.           209 a barn, and there, seated at the table, apparently unaware of his ap- proach, the star, shining resplendent, in all her lustrous glory. "Mr. Lovell, this is my wife, her sister, Miss Perkins, and my little daughter, Francia." Each arose as her name was pionounced. and courtesying po- litely, resumed her seat, while Richard blushingly bowed his most respectful salutations. The meal passed off, as such meals do, with the usual commonplace remarks most fitting for the occasion. Richard had made no blunders yet, and he began to congratulate himself that it would be much easier than he supposed; for they either knew nothing of his uncouth manners, or if they did, their excellent training enabled them to conceal the feelings of disgust which surged with-in. The meal over, Isaac conducted him to the. sitting-room, in which stood a large book-case, filled with novels, books of travel, and biographies. He opened the case, and taking down several choice volumes, laid them be- fore him; and then he happened to think that he had some unbound sheets of travel, with 'geographical explanations, up stairs, in his old school-chest; it was but the work of a moment, and he would run up and get them. While he was gone, and as Richard was carelessly taking down book after book, he said, "How happy you must all be with such a choice collection of books so near at hand," glancing furtively at Sarah. "O, we care nothing for them, seldom reading one, unless it is a new and popular work of fiction or travel," Sarah replied, pleasantly, and with such a look of tender love that Richard stood entranced, nor no- ticed the approach of Isaac with an armful of unbound periodicals. "Look them  over, and select what you want, and come ahead, and let's take a chaw of tobacco in the office," he said, hurrying away. "I don't use the article," Richard said, abstractedly; and looking up, found to his surprise Isaac was gone, and he was alone with her whom he had so much dreaded! "I think if I could. have all the books I want, and enough to eat and drink, my cup of joy would be full," he said, slowly, and evidently after some reflection. "I never thought book-worms filled very important positions in so- ciety," she said, carelessly, and without an effort. He had made a mis- take; but it was said,. and could not be remedied, therefore, to make- the best of a bad move, he must go'on and argue the case, and if beaten, to politely retreat: so he said, "Book-worms rarely, if ever, move in society; but on the outskirts, in their dreary, solitary closets, where they study out the cause and effect of all things; and when they have become sufficiently learned, 18    '   210        LOVE ON THE WING, so that people can put confidence in their conclusions, they are invited into the centre, and are respectfully heard, or their productions care- fully perused." "They are, no doubt, sometimes heard, but in silence and contempt, or told to go back and learn more before attempting to teach those wiser than themselves; or, if their productions are read, as no doubt they would be, and carefully, they are thrown into the fire, and left to smoulder there in. ashes, as the most fitting place,". she said, very sar- castically, but with such a look of pitying love for Richard, that he gloried because he was beaten. It was better to be .beaten thus than to conquer; but how she did it, he could not for the life of him tell; nor would he have dared to speak thus to her, thinking it ungallant and ungentlemanly, as no doubt it would have been for him, but from her it was right and proper. So he concealed his confusion the best he could, and said,- There was Isaac Newton, renowned as the most learned of modern philosophers, who cared nothing for society, and scoffed its forms and coventionalities, as the idle whims of a morbid intellect or vitiated taste; while he himself plunged deep down in the mysteries of things, and brought up truths, which through all time had been hidden from man, because of his unaccountable ignorance, to be a glory to the world, and an honor to his name," he said, wondering how she would refute such an argument; yet she did, by one of her subtle manoeuvres, wholly un- known to Richard. "Yes; but he was one among ten thousand. Others had labored as faithfully as he, and been rewarded by jeers and contempt, until at last, in despair, they sank like the vulgar throng, whom they affected to despise, into the grave. But admitting Newton to have done great things, circling his brow with the chaplet of fame, we, his admirers, like him, will die, and those who come after us will likewise die, on to in- finitum, until all are dead, and then how much better than ourselves is Newton?" Richard was bewildered. He had no business arguing with her, for his subtlest logic was as chaff before her, which"was dis- pelled by one motion of her magic wand. After a few more casual re- marks, on interesting and local subjects, he withdrew with an armful of books to the office, deeply impressed with the beauty, wit, intelligence, and accomplishments of one who could never be other than a friend; yet it was with a sigh that he came to this conclusion; for with her, he thought he could'be happy anywhere; and if William himself would never marry, ar'd had never made such propositions to Richard, there might be a faint - yes very faint-chance that Richard might get the 2,              I -   BRIDGET AND HER LOVERS.          2" fair young belle:' But as things stood now, his case was as hopeless as the Hibernians around; yet she had made such an impression on his mind, thbat none of his efforts would efface her from his thoughts; and as he was earnestly invited to come, he kept coming during all the fol- lowing summer, the most eventful in the history of this story, until at, last the friendship culminated in a proposal and an ehgagement, Rich- ard resolving that if she would not go there, she might go with him anywhere, and they be happy. CHAPTER XXXI. BRIDGET AND HER LOVERS. BRIDGET was not without her lovers, who could listen to her droll sarcasms in delight, and think them the emanations of a full, if not a well-stored mind. To such, her rebukes were received without a murmur, nay, even courted, thinking she thought more of them when administering such a severe tongue flagellation; or else they desired it because she was so good and kind afterwards, when trying to heal the great ruptures she had made in their affections. Her tongue, though a source of much annoyance to many, was to these a source of much gratification, if not actual amusement. After such storms she was usually very quiet and gentle. She was either in one or the other ex- treme-; and when she was good, if her manners had been more dignified, and her words better selected, she would not have been a very unamiable woman; but such characters, whether cultivated or not, are objectiona- ble, for no one can tell at what time, nor for what cause, a furious storm may arise; and when all the evil qualities of the human heart are linked to such a character, then it becomes insupportable. There is nothing to. excuse words spoken in haste and in anger, except the temper from which they cone'; and even this is no excuse; for should a temper, because it is irritable, be excused in giving pain to another? Nay; either it should be restrained entirely, or else, whenever it shows itself, he who is thus rebuked, should be allowed to take a club and knock the offender down, and then trample him ignominiously into the dust. One is as excusable as the other, and if allowed to choose between the two, I would select the latter as soon as the former. But all wish to live, and I suppose somebody must be tormented thus'   212        LOVE ON THE WING. long; but there is one thing certain, that person will never be the writer, who is thus made to suffer because another wishes the precious ! r:   privilege of living and abusing a fellow-being, that he or she may after- wards pour the balm of love into gaping wounds. These lovers of Bridget either liked her for her qualities, or for her beauty, or for the position they would occupy as her husband. She certainly was beloved by some, if not for all the reasons above enumer- ated; and she would undoubtedly have stepped off with one of them if William had been willing. William was, however, desirous of having her marry some one who would be an acceptable and an agreeable com- panion to both, and one who would push on the duties of the place with vigor and good judgment. Such were not easily found. William, in order to retain her, and prevent her from accepting one of the numer- ous proposals which were made on repeated occasions, had to promise that he would give to her what he had promised to give to both Richard and her if they married. This was an inducement to remain single, and consequently each was retained as long as possible at her shrine, and when they would be put off with no further delays, they withdrew, leaving Richard with his prize undisturbed. Before this, however, she threatened to Richard, on several occasions, to-marry one of them, who, instead of sighing, as she expected, wished her much joy. She did three several times actually give out that she was going to marry, and all expected to see her return with her hus- band; but he didn't come, nor has he yet. The ruse had no effect upon Richard, except to regard her with less respect than before. If she could only have got Richard in love with her, as her other lovers were, she would have been perfectly satisfied; for they loved her with all her foibles, faults, and shortcomings. With the last two shorn off, she would not have been so very objectionable. Foibles, by themselves alone, and if given with a little smile in one corner of the mouth, and in a mild and gracious manner, are no serious drawhacks to the happi- ness of a family; and he who truly loves his wife, will not permit so light a thing to disturb his serenity, or the happiness of the family. Differences of opinion will sometimes arise; but if both are wise, they will not be carried so far as to endanger the peace of the house. There was one by the name of John Huss, who appeared more de- voted than all the others; and in order not to encumber the story with too many characters, which already seems replete, we will centre in him some of the peculiarities of the rest. John Huss loved her, and what is more wonderful, appeared' to be sincere and devoted in it. He was extremely gracious to her affected and awkward formalities, which filled   JOHN IUSS.            213 every body else with feelings of disgust. He flattered her vanity, laughed at her borrowed witticisms every time they were re-told, mourned in her grief, and rebuked with his frown all her traducers. Such love she could not help but return, and she did; though it was like the love she was ready to give to Richard, and this was, that in case her other pro- ject failed, she could throw herself upon his protection. Of course he knew nothing of her intentions; and as she put him off, from time to time, with the assurance that they would soon marry, he gladly, though with a sigh, waited. He, like William, thought it could make no ma- terial difference as to the day, week, month, or even year, so long as it was sure to take place some time, he cared not whether it was now or then. He took her to balls, picnics, shows, and parties, at intervals, during nearly all the years of this story. His love, like all true love, did not run smooth, and she ruffled the bosom of the flood more by her un- merited tongue rebukes than by any other cause. After he had waited on her for three or four months, with regularity, promptness, and gal- lantry, she, thinking he was too devoted, or was loving her too much, would throw a damper upon his heart in the shape of taunts, sarcasms, saucy words, and other missiles of a dampening tendency; and perhaps she wound up by telling him she didn't care a fig for him, and he might go where she would dot willingly accompany him. Now such sentiments do really make a. fellow feel rather bad, espe- cially when he has been loving her so dearly, and waiting upon her with so much scrupulous gallantry. He retires home chopfallen, vowing he will never again be so foolish as to allow himself to wait upon one who repays him with such unmerited thanks. Perhaps he keeps this reso- lution a year, and perhaps not;. it would depend altogether on the ca- prices of her own fancy, for no one could determine with any certainty how long she would like the lover she had accidentally come across in the person of another. Perhaps he, like John, could bear her rebukes uncomplainingly, and then, like a whipped cur, kiss the rod that slashed him. If this was the case, she wouldn't get sick of a new lover in a good while, and then John mourned in sadness his bad luck; for, in all probability, his wounds were by this time healed, and he was ready to receive another flogging from her. One sweet smile from her now, and he is by her side again, forgiving and forgiven. Another sweet month or more of happiness follows, which to him is perfect bliss, and thenl there is a rupture, caused by no fault of his own, but by the ambition of some other aspirant to the Irish throne, who, at first, could flatter more, laugh the loudest, spend the most money, and drive her out more   211        LOVE ON THE WING. frequently than John. For this cause poor John is again shipped, and told never to let her see him there again. Again he goes home, no wiser, but more hurt than before. His pre- vious resolves are taken with more resoluteness of purpose, to forever debar himself the pleasure of her society. He nourishes his rejected love in silence, and broods over his troubles as being without a parallel in the history of any other. He. can't see why he, of all the rest of men, should be thus afflicted. Nothing that he can see has he done to merit such continued ill-treatment from her. He inquires around, and finds, to his sorrow, that Richard entertains hopes hostile to his de- signs. Can it be possible that he has such a rival, and one too, whom, of all others he most dreads. He wonders what in the world possesses him to want her; but soon he learns, with everybody else, that there are undercurrents flowing round the idol of his cherished hopes, and upon which he can exercise no restraining influence. They flow on continually, regardless of his wishes, blasting his hopes, and torturing him into despair. The' lustre of her star is brightening, making her more and more valuable as each revolving day rolls round. If he could only get her now, the acquisition would be one of inestimable value. She is worthy the effort; and what are a few rebuffs when weighed against the chances? They are nothing. He would be willing to endure tenfold more than he has ever yet suffered could he be assured, of the realization of his most cherished hopes. This assurance he can never get so long as there are insuperable barriers to the attainment of his ends. Could he remove these, his success was certain; but how? He pressed his suit more earnestly than ever, and he would receive no. hint that negatived- his designs. He was obsequious in his atten- tions, coming oftener and staying longer than was agreeable to either her or William; and when reminded of the disagreeableness of such attentions, by vague and distant implications, he rudely laughed and kissed her, in the hope of appeasing what he termed a mere lover's quarrel. Thus mollified, she appeared more resigned than before, and she received his caresses with no greater signs of disapproval. But William continually urged upon her the necessity of compelling him to discontinue his attentions. She always received such sugges- tions from William in mingled scorn and contempt, reiterating her fixed determination to have some fun, whether he or Richard liked it or not. And when told that Richard would hardly like to see him with her so much, as she expected to marry him, and he her, it was not hardly becoming anrvr   ....thro h;.ln  n' 1 A1 -' lllinns she turned     JOHN HUtSS JEALOUS.         215 a deaf ear, and at the same time declared that if he wouldn't go with her, she could get somebody who would. She wasn't going to wait for him, and lose all the fun there was going. She didn't believe in stay- ing tied up in the house all the while doing his work, when she could have some fun just as well as not. If she, persisted in her resolve, William's anger was aroused, and he rebuked her obstinacy in words rather discourteous. He would have something that needed doing very much, something that would have to be attended to immediately, or loss would be incurred. The raspberries were picked, and needed canning, or else they would be a dead loss. The butter ought to be packed, and not left standing in pans so long. If she didn't attend to thiiigs, he would cut the bushes down, and sell all the cows; for there is no use of having anything, unless we take care of it. Perhaps she would comply with his wishes when he declared them so plainly, and dismiss all her admirers. But he received a blowing in return, if she had to wait very long for him to get Richard to take the hint to take her out, or give her some present. After two or three of these he would relent, and let her invite the attentions of one either before dismissed, or some other neophyte for matrimonial honors, when he could put her off no longer with the hope that Richard would in a day or two see the point, and be glad to accept the issue. This John Huss worked there with the rest, and he used to east very many angry glances towards Richard, who, though he did not seem to care anything about her, nor make any demonstrations in that direc- tion. he regarded as being in his way. He didn't know hardly-what to think about him, for he rarely, if ever, went with her, and absolutely never to any public gathering; but still she often spoke of hin, and she must entertain hopes which John would rather have directed to- wards himself. But how could he change them from Richard to him- self? He could not tell. If he could only get him away from there, and Dlit himself in his place, it would be very easy. He could try it. He couldn't any more than fail, and possibly he might succeed. His eye brightened at the thought of success. He would tell stories about him, and get the men in league against him. But most of the men were friendly to her, and as they wished to forward her interests, they could do it in no way as well as to try and marry heli to Richard. So instead of leaguing the men against him, they were already enlisted for him. He was balked on the siart, and he would have to resort to other measures. He had tried William, but he could make no impression on his mind. He had tried her, and she, though listening, would say nothing furthering his projects.   1!t    216        LOVE ON THE WING. Thus this brave young lover worked from a time anterior to the com- mencement of our story, and clear down to the close. He worked with an enthusiasm worthy a better cause; and if he had known the odds that were against him, he would have given it up in despair, and never allowed himself to think one thought on the subject again. Such is the tenacity of our love, that when once it is fixed upon some bewitch- ing beauty, we find it almost impossible to withdraw it. We are blind to all the barriers or objections which may be raised against the con- summation of our long-cherished hopes, and we struggle on, believing that to-morrow, or next day, or next week, or next month, something will turn up that will facilitate, if: not accomplish, the objects we hav- in view. Such hopes every character in this play entertain. None of them are exempt from wishing to see brought about in some way, by whatever means, the result which all have been so long laboring to achieve. She who wields the most power, is as helpless as the weakest. He whose word is law within the jurisdiction of his domain, is as powerless to bring about what he evidently had so much at heart,- namely, the marriage of his housekeeper to Richard,- as is our poor, friendless, and uninfluential John Huss. There is Isaac, working these fifteen years to marry his sister-in-law to his obstinate brother, and yet is no nearer, nor in fact so near, as he was when he commenced. He is king of Hart Lot, and the strongest force of mercenaries he can muster retire discomfited from the attack, declaring that the place is so well manned, that it is impregnable to all their assaults. Richard is neutral, looking on and enjoying the fight, yet sharing in none of the ambitious aspirations of the contesting parties, and therefore is ex- posed to no danger. He cares not which wins, for no advantage will accrue to him in case either should, or both; and it certainly would be the very worst thing that could happen to him to marry the one held out. In haying and harvesting there necessarily were many laborers, and to whom the ardent was freely administered, and on some occasions they may have imbibed too much. John had enlisted two or three con- federates on his side, by representing to them various and unfounded stories; and as all were very noisy, it was an easy matter to pick a quarrel with Richard. During the interchange of unfriendly remarks, Richard was struck in the face with a stone. He grappled his assail- ant, and after administering a few blows on his face, released him, when he immediately stooped, and raising a large stone, threw it with all his might at Richard's head. It struck him on the ear, and cut it clear through, penetrating even the scalp. It stunned, but it did not pros-   MURDEROUS INTENTIONS.          217 trate him. He again grappled with his antagonist, but was prevented from doing him that injury which his unjustifiable conduct so justly merited, by the interposition of the latter's friends. Richard's ear bled profusely, and stained his shirt and clothes with the crimson gore. He continued at his work all the afternoon without intermission. This tragedy happened at noon, as the party was return- ing from dinner to the field, in the year 1865. On another occasion, a huge butcher-knife was sharpened and se- creted, for the purpose of relieving Richard of his unnecessary presence. On this, as well as on the other occasion, both the assailants were discharged from William's employ, but were, in a year or so, again engaged. - All these attacks upon Richard did no good whatever, for he re- mained the same towards those who had ill-treated him, and to those who hadn't, as before. He was not ill-tempered to one, nor demon- strative to the other; and he continued to discharge his duties the same as if nothing had happened. He didn't object to John Huss taking possession of his gem; but he would rather not be hit with any more stones, for one might accidentally hit where it would prove more than a wound; and it is the greatest wonder in the world that the one with which he was hit didn't kill him outright. It was not the fault of him who threw it, but it was his good fortune to have it guided by a fatality, over which neither had any control, to a spot but an inch from a place where even a less powerful blow would certainly have killed him. It was a matter of small concern to him at which of the two alternatives he at last arrived, for one was. no less objectionable than the other; and if he had been compelled to choose between the two, - marry or die, - the last would have been the easiest, the most glorious, and the best. John was very shrewd in getting some one else to perform that, which, had it been successful, would not have prevented him reaping the rewards of his villany. Even then he would have been as far from the attainment of his object, as he was before, for Richard was neither- in his way nor anybody's if she was all that was desired; for he could not have won her in any event, as she was at that time engaged in an- gling for a much larger fish, which, without biting, only delayed, without destroying her hopes. She would have put him off from time to time with vague and unsatisfactory excuses, until he, despairing, would have given her up; and this would have ended a struggle which has been carried on so long, without any having attained the object of his am- bition. 19   i[    s218        LOVE ON THE WING. '4 '              ,               * CHAPTER XXXII. WILLIAM AND THE CONFEDERATES. IT was about a week after Isaac met and engaged his three merce- naries, that William, who was standing in the Lake House bar- room, taking a drink with a friend, saw Mr. Locker, after he had ap- proached him cautiously and unobserved. Mr. Locker laid-his hand on William's shoulder, and tapping him gently, said,  "Good morning, Mr. Wood. I'm glad to see you looking so well.". "Ha, good morning, Locker. Glad to see you; come, take a drink." "No, I thank you; I never indulge." "Ha! never? I don't see how you keep house." "Well enough; and that too, without drinking." "I don't know but I might. I never tried." "Will you ever try?" "Not on purpose." "Do you think it good for the health?" "I never experienced any of its ill effects." "Never!" "Unless it's ill to be pleasantly oblivious to all surrounding things." "You have been in that condition?" * Most pleasantly." "Was the effect pleasant on regaining consciousness?" "Have you any -recollection of its being otherwise?" "No; but, say, are you at leisure?" "As soon as I take another drink. Better take a glass." "No, I thank you;" and he stepped back towards the door, waiting William's pleasure, who not only drank once, but thrice more before he leisurely rejoined Mr. Locker; for there were many button-holeing Wil- liam for a treat, or for some other favor, perhaps not as disinterestedly as Mr. Locker. "Come in this way, Mr. Wood," Locker said, opening a door into a private parlor. "Here we can talk unobserved, and enjoy a short, agreeable visit." "It would be more agreeable, though, if you would ring that bell, and order a couple of warm slings." "I'll order them if you'll drink them.'    WHSPERED   CAUTION.         219 "No, not alone. There, you needn't order; I never drink alone." "Ha! is it better when others drink?" "No; but it's more sociable and pleasant. You spoke of business.'" "Yes. I was thinking. Let me ask one more question, then I'll to the business. A friend of mine wished me to inquire for him chn- cerning a certain young lady. Do you know Sarah Perkins?" "I've seen her," he said, casting an inquiring glance at him. "Is she an estimable young lady?" "I believe she is. But your young gentleman friend should find out these things in person." "He would like to know before presenting himself. It's strange you never thought of marrying, William." "Well, I have thought of it sometimes." "Not seriously?" "Yes."  "Wall, say whenever you are ready. I would like to introduce you to a very pretty Cuban lady, of wealth and refinement, who has been stopping at my house the past winter," he said, pleasantly. "Is she a relative of yours?" "Distantly connected, I believe, to my wife." "Ha! Well, I'll let you know in time, so she can prepare her toilet," he said, rising. "But, say, don't go yet. I have one other matter of which I would speak; but how to say it, and not offend, I can't guess." "Don't be afraid of offending, but spit her out." "I don't know but you have been informed, or received hints, that scandal is whispered around." "By whom?" he asked, turning ashy pale round the lips. "By everybody." "By everybody!" he repeated, as his color changed from white to red. "Yes; everybody is whispering scandal." "Let them whisper. I suppose it is a free country." "Yes; but not to burn, nor to steal, nor to murder, nor to -, nor do anything wrong." "Whois?"  "I didn't say; but those who do such things receive their reward, sooner or later, and it comes either in loss of property or declining health." "Yes, I see; but it is time enough when it comes to think of it." "We should prepare against it."   i220        LOVE ON THE WING. "Do you?" "Most certainly; and I would have you." "Don't you know that people often get rich by minding their own business?" "There, now, you are getting mad." "Not much; but these interested applications do annoy me un- pleasantly." "But I hope the interest I feel in my friend will excuse what other- wise would seem impertinence." "Certainly; I'll give you a call some day." "Do. You will be most hospitably entertained, and you'll find I've not over-estimated the value of one you can't fail to love." "We'll see; but I must be gone. I wish you could take a drink with me on this, you would enjoy it so much." "It would give me more pain than pleasure; but when you drink, if it will be companionship for you, think I'm drinking by your side." "To be deceived, when I drink to the success of the cause, and find you not there." "Rather than have you deceived, zounds! I'll drink, but at my ex- pense." "No, but at mine, for I am the one most benefited by these espou- sals, and I could not think to have them cost another a dime. Here, waiter, put up two of those warm whiskey slings."  "What makes you call them slings " "Because they sling a, fellow down so easily." "Well, here, I won't have that kind, for I'd rather be a sling than be slung." "O, you needn't be afraid; it'll take more than one to sling a mouse, for I've 'this morning taken six, and even now feel more like slinging you than being slung." "Wall, let's see. Here, you take that - that's the fullest." "As you like, but drink hearty, hoping success." "By the saints, man'! I'can't see how you can like that stuff, for it tastes and feels to me as if I'd swallowed a small cat." "It'll taste better next time; and if you take these doses every hour, you'll feel like a new man." "Yes, I begin to feel it now; but good day. Come over." "Yes, I will; good day." Poor Locker was not too fast in going, for by the time he arrived at the gate of his beautiful residence he was faintly sick, and trembled, and vomited, and was carried into the house.   MR. JONES'S SPEECH.          221 "Why, my dear, what is the matter? How happened this, for your breath does smell as strong of whiskey as a toper's?" "O, that fellow whom all do love so much, did ask me up, and I did drink with him, hoping he would marry our fair cousin." "You need not have taken the vile stuff. Next time take water, drink much, and success will be as certain." William walked out about his business, all unconscious of the sick- ness of his friend, but had not gone far when he saw the long-tail coat coming from an opposite direction across to meet him.. The flaps were rising pretty fast behind, for he was afraid his friend would escape him. "Halloo 1 Mr. Wood. I'd see you a moment, if you are not engaged." "I'm always engaged, but I'm at your service." "I'd like some quiet place to talk, unheeded by this gaping throng." "How long will it take?" "O, about half an hour." "Then walk over-to the hotel; they have a cosey little back parlor there, where you can say, undisturbed, all you wish." "Well, lead the way, and I'll follow." "Come right along. Do you ever drink?" " No, I thank you; never drink a drop." "How unfortunate and unhappily you must live." "You are mistaken, sir, very much. On the contrary I live most pleasantly, with a happy and agreeable family." "Ha! and never drink  I hardly thought it possible to live thus; and for me, I'm certain I should die." "Not if you had plenty of water." "O, no, that's another consideration." "Are you so sharp always "   * "No; O, no, only when I drink. Come this way." "No, I thank you. Please excuse me; but as soon as you are ready, walk in this way;" and he opened the door, and leaving it ajar, waited for the appearance of William, who;once again at the bar, many friends crowded around to see him, and have a moment's chat, and perhaps a glass. It was some time before he finished, and poor Mr. Jones felt ill at ease to think he staid so long while he was waiting on him. Presently he came along, and the 'two went into the-back parlor, which was undisturbed since he was there a few moments before. "There, you see, I've brought you to a quiet place, where anything you may say no one will ever know." "Yes, I'm glad you knew of so quiet a retreat, for I had some im-   222        LOVE ON THE WING. portant business I wished to communicate to you, and I have sought you before, to urge upon your consideration certain things which should occupy a part of your attention, as it concerns most vitally your own well-being, and the stability and permanence of your house." "Ha! Say on; my time is pressing," he said, alarmed. "Yes. Perhaps you are not aware of the odious reflections that are being made because of yourliving in an unmarried state with one who has not the confidenoe nor the respect of her surroundings; and it behooves you, if you maintain the position which your wealth and standing in society assume, to discard her or marry her, as every one should, anm live respectably. I say this more as a friend than a foe,'wishing you well, and I hope you will not deem me impertinent in presenting a subject so unpleasant to your feelings. In doing this,.)ou may rest as- sured that I'm but speaking thq/convictions of every right-minded cit- izen, all of whom will reiterate'my words in sorrow, and wish it could not be said of you; for they all regard it as much a calamity to them as it is to you, as the example of your influehce will tend to demoralize their youthful children, whom they desire to rear in accordance with the principles of Christianity, law, and order, though I fear by saying it I shall forfeit your respect; and if my endeavors meet with this re- sult, I can only excuse myself by thinking that my regard for the in- terests of my neighbors and friends should have carried me so far be- yond the bounds of forbearance as to lose me their regard, and yet neither benefiting them nor the cause I so zealously yet uselessly es- poused, while I lose all I before possessed--your friendship and es- teem." "Yes, I suppose so; but I'm. going to marry in a little while, and that will fix everything all right. I believe you have a mortgage against the lot I bought of Adams, which I think is now nearly due: I'll come up and pay it in a few days." "Io so. Come up; we'll be glad to see you, and if convenient, come up again. You will harbor no ill will against me on account of the words I'e used?" "O0, no, not in- the least. We are as good friends as ever, and if you would take a drink it would smooth the roughness all down." "Wall, I will, so come on, at my expense." "As you like. I'll take some whiskey. i What do you have " "The same." ' Fix it good, for I'm doing well to-day." "Here's my respects," he said, drinking. "Drink hearty, always hoping for the best."    WILLLAM AND MR. ADAMS.          223 The speech Mr. Jones had made was prepared by the whole family, and committed to memory one evening, about one week previous to its delivery. Mr. Adams, not being in town that day, did not see him; but about a week afterwards he saw him, and invited him into the office, where it was all quiet and still, and there he had a long talk with the soft- hearted William; and it was well he was not in town on the day he received such a berating from the other two meddlesome individuals, for he would not have listened so attentively, nor answered as respect- fully, as he did; but on this occasion he was as good-natured as ever, and received with a shrug of his shoulder all Mr. Adams said. "Well, Mr. Wood, I'm glad to see you, as I have some good things to say, which I think will entertain you." "Ha! What are they? I'm impatient to hear." "I hope you will be gentle, and not take offence at what I say, for I do it reluctantly ; and only after the earnest solicitation of your friends, would I consent to incur your displeasure by mentioning that which cannot but be as objectionable to your ears as it is painful for me to speak. Perhaps no one has hinted to you the objectionable features of your domestic establishment; but every one is wondering why you do not establish it on a basis similar to that existing in other well-ordered households. The reasons why you do not, are unknown to the people, who feel, naturally, that if they are not conclusive, you are justly cen- surable for a state of things which no community would be justified in tolerating; and we, as members and conservators of the town, do earnestly entreat you to consider the anomalous condition of your af- fairs, which, while they reflect discredit upon you, stamp the town with infamy, as being aiders and abettors in a crime, by allowing crime to go unrebuked, which will go down with them and you to the grave, thus sullying our dying bed by recollections that we all have lived a life fraught with not only evil to ourselves, but which will be visited in sorrow upon the unborn future. Do, Mr. Wood, as you value your own good name, and the wishes of your friends, consider this, and, if possible, amend. I mention it in the name of our beloved citizens, who have delegated me to represent to you, in as mild words as the sentiments conveyed would allow, how grateful they would be if you would modify a little the programme which you have marked out for yourfiiture life. In doing this, I feel as if I had discharged an onerous and painful duty; but if my words awaken in your mind an assenting response, I shall feel that there is some excuse for'what otherwise would look like an impertinent piece of business."   i .     224        LOVE ON THE WING. "Are you through?Wall, in conclusion, you may tell the people that I propose to tend to my business; and if they and you have not enough to do, I'll invite you all down, and give you a job. Good morning." "Good morning, Mr. Wood. I hope we will meet again, and renew the sentiments of friendship which have so long existed between us." By this time he had reached the door, and as he passed out, muttered something about going to a warmer climate than this country affords, and where farmers needn't carry a pitchfork on their shoulder two thirds of the year. Nothing more was said to William by special del- egations, but words were occasionally dropped in his hearing which savored more of contempt for his practical sagacity than of respect for him or his wealth.  CHAPTER XXXIII. HORACE CARIEN.-HS FAMLY.-HS SON'S LOVE. IN the employ of William was a middle-aged man, of a lean, lanky, wiry sort of a nature, who in the year 1865 fell from grace, or rather fell in the good opinion of the minister next to the throne. This person is no other than the redoubtable Horace Carmen, famous for some of his peculiar eccentricities, such as a wilful, imperious tem- per, with a proud and conscious spirit. He makes a good husband, is a kind, indulgent father, - though at times his passion gets the better of his judgment - and a steadfast friend. He is a friend to those who are friends to him; and his friendship is more desirable than his en- mity, although he is not a brutal, relentless, and unforgiving foe. This man was the father of three children, two boys and one girl, all grown up to years of discretion, without, however, reducing their knowledge to every-day practice. The oldest of the boys, Reuben, paid assiduous court to the glory of the Irish star, which was just now in the ascendant; and it made him extremely wroth to think that his passion was not reciprocated, and he attributed it to Richard, who, all unconscious of the increasing enmities against him, treated them all, whenever they met, with his usual politeness and respect. This, by the parents, was thought a very eligible match, and per. mitted to go on without a word of remonstrance, never dreaming of the unhappy results to which it would eventually lead. The conse-    "OVER'S PERSECUTION.          225 quences are seldom taken into consideration, especially by the lovers themselves, who are all-absorbed in the one prevailing passion, name- ly, love; but parents and guardians, who do not look through the same spectacles, weigh the merits of candidates for the hymeneal knot in an impartial balance. The uncongenial temper of the blighted rose was never, by the parents, considered an insuperable barrier to a union with their son, and sthe position in which it would place him, made it, on the whole, rather desiiable.. They were accompanied sometimes, in their rambles through the fields, by the young man's sister, who, not wishing to hear a conversa- tion which had no interest for her, sought and obtained the company of an Irishman, also in the employ of William. This was rather brought about through the medium of the lovers; she telling her brother, and he told his love, and she invited him, for the company's sake, to walk with them. Thus they were matched all around, and if they couldn't have fun, there was no use of anybody's trying; and fun they had to their heart's content. William had no power or au- thority in the case, for she was going to have her fun whether he liked it or not; all he did say, to any effect, was, he didn't want to have her marry; and this was a useless caution, for she had no intention of mar- rying unless she married him; and she made him think, quite often, that she was really going to marry to frighten him into a confession of love which he didn't feel; but he did all he could to prevent it, by promising all sorts of good things, and finally the present of a farm if she would remain single or marry Richard. Time wore away with these lovers, just the same as it does with all others, and at last it came to the parents' ears that their beloved daughter was holding clandestine assignations with a sprig of the Green Isle, and they were very wroth thereat, and they forbade the girl doing so any more; and also the young man was forbidden the privi- leges even of the yard, the offence being considered by them of so great a magnitude, that he was threatened with instant, annihilation should he dare to transcend those regulations. But if never seen in the yard, he could have been seen in the misty twilight of the summer evenings sauntering around at a goodly distance from the yard, where no one could deny him the privileges of those more fortunate, though perhaps no less worthy than himself; and here he awaited the signals previ- tusly agreed upon; and then when the shadows of night crept on, and all was still in the peaceful sleep of oblivion, she slowly and cautiously descended, and sought out her lover behind the more dusky shades of the hawthorn or the willow hedge, and there they exchanged those    226        LOVE ON THE WING. sighs and greetings which distinguish lovers in the last stage of un- wedded bliss. This state of things could not, however, continue without somebody knowing it; and when, once a thing is known, it spreads like wildfire from one to another, and especially on such a place is this more observ- able, where everybody seems to take pleasure in telling to another all he knows. Mr. Carmen, being of an excitable and very impulsive na- ture, made it far worse by the tremendous manner in which he hurled invectives upon the heads of the whole Irish nation;, and this, of course, included the heroine herself, which could not by any manner of means be tolerated. When Greek meets Greek then comes the tug of war. They met, but neither was killed; unhappily, however, for both; and both survived to meet again, and measure swords, whish neither seemed inclined to sheathe in peace. If I should use the same words which were exchanged during this bitter controversy, they would convey but a fee- ble impression of the actual scene; but the words would not be per- missible in such place, neither would it be in good taste to reproduce such wicked scenes in a public print. Enough has been said of her to convey a pretty good idea of her character, and nothing more need be said in regard to it; and when we say that old Mr. Carmen, when an- gry, was equally as unscrupulous in regard to the words he employed, but still he had finer and better shades of character, which you look for in vain in her, -the idea will be fully conveyed that the team was pretty well matched, and one could not possibly get the start of the other, if words could possibly make them even. He told her many things which he would not like to swear to, and he told her many things which she could swear to as being positively trtee, but which she could not tell how he should have found out. Of course all association between her and any of the family was, after this, broken off, but that between the Irishman and the daughter still conilnued, clandestinely however. She had vainly tried to have Wil- liam dismiss the entire family from the -place, but he would not listen to it; consequently she had to nourish her wrath, and find some other mode of revenge. The memory of what he had told her still rankled in her bosom, and it made her speak many sarcastic words to William for tolerating him on the place, all of which, however, were useless, as he was determined to keep together all the hostile elements he could, on purpose to enjoy the fun of the not unfrequent clashing. Some became sick of the continued war, and voluntarily withdrew from the field, leaving to those in possession the glory of a triumph; ,    AN ENRAGED FATHER.           227 but Carmen was not made of this metal; and so long as there was an Irish person living on the place he would fight him, not because he hated them all in general, but because he hated her in particular. She plotted and planned, every way she could think of, to wreak ven- geance upon his terrible head; but all plans failed except one, and from that even her hard and depraved nature at first shrank, because of its black and horrid hideousness. But as she grew in age she grew in wickedness, and that which first seemed to go a little beyond the just bounds of a justifiable vengeance, at last was but as nothing compared to the great measure of offences which time had heaped up against them. And this was the ruin and seduction of his innocent daughter. This she instigated, by compelling the lover of the unhappy girl to engage her in marriage, and then desert her and marry somebody else. This was finally done; and she rubbed her hands in great glee to think she had accomplished so much towards the vindication of her insulted dignity. The lover was hunted froni pillar to post by the enraged father, armed with a pistol, a bowie-knife, and a lath-hatchet, which had been used for cutting tobacco until the edge was not as sharp as it had been; still he thought it would do, and he vowed a terrible vengeance on the head of the guilty wretch when he found him. At last he suc- ceeded in finding him; and he thought he would give him a chance to say his prayers and make his will. While he was berating him for his perfidy in the dishonor of his daughter, he was making ready for the desperate attack which he told him to prepare for. He had just put his hand in his pocket to draw forth one of the weapons, when William appeared upon the scene, and taking the would-be, though justifiable, murderer into his carriage, drove with him to a place of safety.  he next day the seducer could not be found; and not until after the accouchement, and death of the child, did he dare show himself in the vicinity. Her vengeance had been complete and sanguinary; but still he was there fighting bravely for himself, though the lost honor of his daughter was past all earthly forgiveness, and no revenge, however great, could atone or restore that which was forever gone. She could do nothing more, because she had shot the last arrow at her victims, and her quiver was empty; but there was poison and mal- ice enough in her heart to steel ten thousand more. Her enemies were there, and she knew it, waiting, panting, eagerly hoping that an enraged Providence would drop a thunderbolt upon her, and kill her dead. Nothing they could say or do could injure her, for she was   228        LOVE ON THE WING. impervious to all the shafts that could be hurled against her. Words were impotent, and nothing but the hand of death could blot out this vicious representative of the feminine sex, and nothing but death and the flames could atone for the crimes she had so wantonly com- mitted. But they hoped and believed that the time would come when she would receive the just deserts which her crimes deserved, and she be pointed out as an odious and reprehensible person, whom all should avoid, unless they wish to absorb a portion of her contamination. Children were hushed to sleep, with fear and trembling, by the mere mention of her odious name; and when their curiosity was awakened, by age, to inquire who this horrid person was, they were told, but con- tinued to shun her as the most dangerous viper, who, disfigured by its slime and ghastliness the beautiful symmetrical form of the social body; and yet there was no law by which she could be punished, unless it was that last - the silence, and contempt, and scorn of the public; and how any man with a rational judgment, and an apparently conscientious soul, can tolerate, and protect, and encourage to live to the disgrace of all humanity, such a vile representative of mother Eve, is more than our weak comprehensions can account for But she lives, and moves, and has a being on the face of the earth, and by the law none are justified in removing her. If it was a pestilence, carrying dis- ease and death in our Ilidst, why, the proprietor would b' prosecuted and compelled, by tho stern mandate of the law, to abate the evil; neither would they wait for him to do it, they would-do it themselves, and with a vengeance. This, however, destroys only the body, and leaves the soul free and untainted, to soar to its realms of bliss, and receive the rewards of its righteousness here. But how much worse is that pestilence which saps the very foundations of society, corrupting its morals with crime, and the sin of death, perverting all the best and noblest propensities of the human heart to gratify the basest passions, even at the expense and sacrifice of all the best impulses of our na- ture. She had not forgotten the part which Mrs. Bordman played with Mrs. Bentley soon after the death of the old gentleman; neither did she try soon to forgive it, because the memory of it was continually rankling in, her unquiet and malicious heart. Mrs. Bordman was be- yond her reach, and she tried by flattery and presents to allay the revengeful animosities which she had good reason to believe were still entertained against her. In this she succeeded in part; and   MRS. BORDMAN'S STRATEGY.          229 Bridget allowed her resentful feelings to lie appeased for a time by Mrs. Bordman's flattering insinuations, for she, Bridget, was well aware. that it would be utterly useless to attempt anything against her. Mrs. Bordman's strategical sagacity would prevent her from being led into any snares or traps laid by this revengeful woman. If anything were attempted it might result to Bridget's disadvantage, as she had not that hold on William which would secure his cooperation in a fight against this his most beloved sister. She knew this, and feared to undertake a job the result of which she could not clearly foresee. But if her husband should happen to fail, like the husband of Mrs. Bentley, she Idid not know but there might be a chance yet of inflicting summary punishment on her. She was determined to try it some time, and she smiled a wicked smile as she thought how sweet would be the revenge she would yet obtain. She had devised many schemes to bring about this resolve, but they had all been rejected; either because they were not severe enough, or because the agent would be too clearly exposed. She wished to cut, and not be seen; and she wished to cut deep, so as to wound, and, if possible, beyond the virtue of healing salve to cure. If she could ac- complish this, she thought her enemies would all be sufficiently pun- ished. Mrs. Bordman was her last and most bitter foe, and this Bridget discovered by words she overheard afterwards, and not intended for her ears; and though they came near producing a rupture of the hol- low friendship that was subsisting between them, Mrs. Bordman suc- ceeded in smoothing them over by palavering words and rich presents. They were not forgotten, although she allowed herself to be persuaded that it was all right, and that nothing harmful was intended. At last an occasion was presented. Julia Bordman, Mrs. Bordlnan's daughter, a young lady of seventeen, of accomplished and prepossess- ing manners, came down visiting her uncle, in company of a lady friend, in the fall of '69. Julia is as gay and lively as she is good and pretty. She is a brunette, with a wealth of jet black hair, her crowning glory. These two young, innocent, and guileless ladies became quite inti- mate during the two Weeks of their sojourn with the arch deceiver. They frequently, in the stillness of the evening hour, strolled off to- gether through the garden and along the shores of the lake. All this was good enough, and no one dreamed of any latent intentions on the part of their chaperon, save William and Richard. William was seen leisurely strolling around, on several occasions, apparently oblivi- 20   OI ;    230        LOVE ON THE WING. ous to all surroundings. No one asked him why, nor suspected the motives of-these nocturnal ramblings, by one who was habitually so quiet, that he seemed to care nothing for the worst tiat might happen. Richard followed the trio on one occasion, unknown to William, at the same time William was on the alert unknown to Richard; though they did not meet, yet both knew each other, and why he was there. Rich- ard, thinking that one was enough, withdrew, and left William to man- age his refractory housekeeper and his niece. It was on the evening before the one on which occurred the disgrace- ful scene at the hop-yard, that William, missing them from the house, sallied forth, in his slippers, in-quest of the wayward fugitives. After wandering about for an hour or so, and until his feet were wet from the dew, he found them in a shady nook, laughing afid talking boister- ously with two young scions of the male persuasion. He commanded his niece, in tones far more authoritative than he dare employ towards her chaperon, to follow him to the house. He wondered where she could be at that hour of the night. He would stop this night-walking by sending her home. After a few sharp rebukes from the virago, Julia and her friend with- drew to more safe, as well as more respectable, quarters. Thus she was saved from a fate ten thousand times worse than death. It was the intention of Bridget to be revenged in the same manner upon her, as she had been upon the refractory Carmens. In this, however, she failed, though not for lack of villany on her part, but because of Wil- liam's fear and love.  We have not done with her yet, and I'm afraid the world will not be, near soon enough for its own good. She is young in age, but old in viciousness and depravity of heart. In order to finish this disgusting and horrid recital at once, we will skip over a few years, and come to the last public exposure of her shameful nature. It was in the sum- mer of the year 1869, in the beginning of hop-picking, when she and some company wished to see the introduction of the business. Conse- quently, towards the evening of the first day, she rode over with her company in a carriage, and instead of going to the place, as any decent people would have done, she drove up and down in front of the very house of him whom she had caused to be wronged but the year pre- vious, and whose -gaping wounds were yet bleeding and fresh, caused byl her own most bloody and villanous hand; and as she drove up and down in front of the house, she sang ribald songs of defiance in the. ears of her weeping victims, such words as these: " Who cares for old    INSULT ADDED TO -INJURY.         231 Hugh Carmen! Go 'long there 1"!' Who cares for old Hugh Carmen! Go 'long! Go 'long there!" &c. And then. to cap the climax of in- iquity with her brazen-faced infamy, she drove into the yard where he was at work, inquiring for him, and yelling the same outrageous words; and as it was growing duskish, whether purposely or by accident I can't say, she came very near driving over the unfortunate Carmen himself. This was too much for forbearance itself to tolerate, and permit to pass unheeded, as he had heard all her previous demonstrations; and so, grabbing the horse by the bit, he backed him violently into the road, nearly upsetting the carriage and injuring its occupants, who, by screams and entreaties, begged him not to back them farther. He desisted, and then followed a war of words for about half an hour, when he again repeated to her many of his previous remarks, only adding a little emphasis to them by reason of the wrongs he had suffered at her hands; and then the combatants were separated by the lateness of the hour, and the arrival oh the scene of William himself, who heard many of the defamatory words of each, without uttering one in excuse or ag- gravation; for the one who was right he dare not reprove, for fear of instant and slashing condemnation, and a wordy war betrays only the ignorance, weakness, and cowardice of those who resort to it. Neither did he wish to check her, for fear of the after effects, in the quietness of his own home. He was anxious that clouds should never rise upon his-home, though he didn't care for them when they did; but yet they wounded him, and left their sting festering in the wound, which could be observed by the crooked, crabbed nature df his spirit, generally so smooth and tranquil. But if she should ever die, as no doubt she will, let every one rejoice and .be glad that earth is rid of one. "Most guilty, most villanous, most dishonored wretch! Wolf in the clothing of the gentle lamb! And in Fashion's most gorgeous apparel! Meretricious-looking, in glittering tinsel shining! The price of dishonored, unholy, ungovernable passion! Dark traitor in the world's most holy camp! Life in saintly garb! assassin masked in Dissimulation's robe!! Vile hypocrite accursed! I strive ih vain to set her evil forth. The words which should sufficiently accurse, And execrate such reprobate, had need  Come glowing from the lips of eldest hell.

"And if a stone reared to earthly vanity Should mark the resting of her horrid, Unsightly, dishonored remains, Let this be inscribed thereon: 'Beneath this truthful stone doth lie The meanest scold that e'er did die; Whose softest word to dearest friend Would make one's hair stand bolt on end! You'd think storms rising when she sung, And thunder was music to her tongue; But when real storms in her did rise, Lightning was twilight to her eyes!

BENTLEYS LESSON TO HER DAUGHTERS. - SHE IS SICK, AND DIES. INCE the death of her son, Mrs. Bentley had refused positively to work or nurse for others, for she thought'she would have to engage some one for herself, as she could hardly discharge the duties of her humble home. She kept about, however, and did all she could, letting that which need'not be done go for abler hands. Her children she kept constantly at school, thinking it better to deny herself some of the comforts of home that they might be benefited, and receive such an education as would fit them to fill with credit any station of life. They improved their time well, and advanced far beyond the most sanguine expectations of their mother and teacher. In the long winter evenings she used to hear them recite their lessons, and not until they were well committed to memory did she allow them to drop their books, and take up their patchwork or embroidery.    MRS. BENTLEY AND HER DAUGHTERS.         233 One of her lessons to her daughters, and on which she dwelt the most, was their, style and manner, both in and out of company; "for," said she, "if you behave well and properly in the privacy of your own homes, you cannot fail to be agreeable in the society of others, whether above or below your own stations of life. Think every one an equal whose character is untarnished, whether he be poor and clothed in rags, or wealthy and clothed in scarlet; for a human soul is beneath the rough exterior of tattered garments, the same as beneath those of the more fortunate and favored class; and that soul God loves as much, and is an equal portion of Himself, and lives immortally the same as others. Never refuse to take the hand of poverty, nor visit the sick, but be to such always a firm, steadfast friend, and their prayers will ascend to the living God in your behalf. Whenever you meet an ac- quaintance, take his hand, and bow, inquire his health and that of his family, and as he leaves you and totters home, he prays for blessings on your head; and when at home he tells of your kindness to him, they all shed tears of gladness, and wish you were their sister, that they might love you more, and partake of your noble Christian spirit." "Why, mother, how shall we know whether they desire our love and sympathy?"Flora asked. "Why, my dear, you needn't know it. Love is a thing you can be- stow upon the ungrateful, free and pure as the rain from heaven. Think of the love of God, how general it is bestowed upon all, even upon those who condemn and despise Him. Unsolicited, all receive His love; nor does He wait till they come to Him, but He pours it out upon the just and upon the unjust, justice to all, partiality to none. I would make no exceptions to a general rule, unless in case of moral depravity or habitual intemperance; the first is pardonable, if he repent, and the first sign should be encouraged; the last is when he reforms." "Why, mother, how would I look going through the streets, shaking lands with every loafer and rowdy I met? Would it not savor more of temerity than of love?" 'I don't want you should go through the streets in that way, but simply bow to those with whom you are acquainted; and if you go into a store or post-office, shake hands with those you know, if they happen to be near you, or in your path. There is a way in which all things should be done, and you are not required to go clear to the back part of the store, where gentlemen are standing round a stove, warming themselves, on purpose to shake hands with every one of them, for this would be forwardness, and is as reprehensible as a haughty, over- bearing manner; but if the article you require is in that direction, and 20, 9   234        LOVE ON THE WING. the clerk asks you that way, then follow, and while he is takingSdown the goods you can exchange a few words with the gentlemen, devoting as much time to each as to any, and omitting none. Don't stare at any one, but look with a kind of retiring glance, both bashful, modest, and pleasant. "The extremes are both objectionable, but between the two is the right place. Never be haughty and supercilious anywhere, for there is no place in which such manners are becoming, and all, even the dearest friends, regret that those they love are so weak; and the other ex- treme, forwardness, is equally reprehensible, and slould be checked at once and emphatically. "Never put anything from you with a quick, impatient movement, as if you were disgusted with it; and if you are asked to look at a thing, examine it with attention, and apparent interest, if you can't manifest a real one. All such little things make the lady; and as your sphere of life is cast in humbler places, it behooves you to pay some attention to these things, in the hope that you will make up, in good manners and deportment, what you have already lost in wealth and position. You cannot be accomplished in all the graces of the lady, for limited means will not permit; but you can more than make up for lack of these, by being good wives, indulgent mothers; and useful, exemplary citizens. And, on the whole, I'm of the opinica that it is better it has happened thus; for had this not come to pass, you would have been brought up in luxurious habits, totally unfitting you for the sterner duties of life i but now, all you can hope for is to become wives of good men, discharging with pleasure all the duties of the house, sharing the burdens, and encouraging the hope of future affluence. No man wishes a rattle-headed girl for a wife, who never swung a broom, nor made a loaf of bread, nor washed a dish, nor made a bed, and I thank my stars that you can now do any, or all of these." The autumn leaves were changing from a green to a brown coloa and occasionally one loosened its hold and fluttered down to the ground. Many of the birds sought warmer climates,.and everything began to put on the hue of winter. The clouds were heavy and lowering; but the Indian summer had not hung its hazy mantle over the earth to screen the scorching rays of the sun, which sometimes shone out warm and bright when the clouds were blown away. Still the world moved on, through joys and sorrows, regardless of the one as of the other. People moved on as they had always done, not minding but a few days the one occasionally dropped from the ranks; the remainder moved on, perhaps dropping a tear, and casting    MRS. LOVELL ASSISTS MRS. BENTLEY.        235 a tlought heavenward, to their destiny, which was beckoning them on- ward, and along the paths their fathers had just trod, who, weary and footsore, had just laid down to rest. Such is life, and such is death, - one travelling in the footsteps of the, other round the world, this preparing us to meet the other; yet how mournfully and reluctantly we part with those we love, and to whom we look for guidance, protection, and encouragement. Still, when the sands of life are run out, there is no alternative but to submit, and bear in patience the decrees of Him whose love is mercy, and whose afflicting hand is laid upon us for the chastening and humbling of our proud spirits. It is that those who are left may be reminded of their own destiny, by the presence of Death continually in their midst. Mrs. Bentley failed rapidly from the middle of autumn till the snow covered the ground as with a fleecy mantle, until at last her daughters had to remain at home and attend to the various duties of the house, and their mother required the constant attention of one. They each sat up alternately, night after night, and alone in that dreary cottage, with Death hovering so near, refusing all offers of the assistance of their kind neighbors, of whom there were many, and willing to do any- thEng and everything, if they could have been permitted; but no, they needed no help, for they were willing, and it was a pleasure which they would not deny themselves, much less permit their friends to do what they were eager and willing to perform. They kept this up till they could do it no longer, at least not without rest and sleep. Mrs. Bentley, whose health was visibly declining, seeing that some- body must come and help her willing and lovingdaughters, bethought who of her many acquaintances she would most like to have. There were two who occupied warm places in the widow's heart, and these were Mrs. Maple and Mrs. Lovell, and of the two she rather liked Mrs. Lovell the best; consequently she sent a message to her, inquiring if she could come and help her a few days, as she was unable to be around, and her little girls were tuckered clear out in consequence of the unremitted attention she had required. Why, certainly Mrs. Lovell would go, and she wondered why in the world she had not sent for her before. She would go right away, at least after combing her hair, which she had not had time to do that day, as she had just finished ironing, which had taken all day. The days were getting so short one hadn't time to do much, especially alone; and she wondered what Richard would do when he came home and found her gone, for she was resolved to stay until Mrs. Bentley was better, not dreaming of leaving her alone with those little children. /   I I       236         LOVE ON THE WING. After her hair was combed, and twisted into a knot on the back of her head, and her mering dress on, she thought she was ready for the journey. But she inspected every room in the house, and turned the cat out into the wood-house, with a huge bone, and a basin full of milk on the step, so she thought she would not die while she was gone. She stood with the door open a minute, and thought if there was any- thing else she had forgotten. She might want a loose wrapper to lie down in occasionally.; yes, she would take it along, for it wouldn't do any hurt if it didn't do any good. Then she stood at the door and looked back at the stove to see that the hearth was shoved up, and no danger of fire around, and she started off. It was but a short distance, about half a mile, and she arrived there about four in the-afternoon, and she was surprised to find Mrs. Bentley so low. "Why in the world didn't you send for me before?" she asked, sur- prised at her pallid countenance, her weak and emaciated condition. "O, we all thought that we could get along without disturbing our kind friends, and that I would soon he up and be able to work as be- fore; but now I fear my time is drawing to a close, and that my earthly existence will be soon terminated," she said, casting a longing look in the direction of one of her daughters, who was engaged in some do- mestic affairs.  "You ought not to think so, Mrs. Bentley, for courage, you know, is half the battle in fighting away disease." "There is no use of hoping now. Only think, I've kept up and hoped, and battled. with this, now these three months -yes, nearly a year, since I began to fail; and during all this time I've struggled alone, and single-handed, against this slowly undermining influence; for it seems as'if something was gradually sapping up my life, as I feel myself growing weaker and weaker, and a kind' of drowsy languor will atl times creep over me, and I feel as if I were gently falling away into the arms of death. My greatest anxiety now is for my daughters, for who knows what will become of them?" "Don't think of it, Mrs. Bentley, for 1 can't bear the thought of having you go; but do not let anything trouble you, for that will only aggravate the difficulty which, I hope, by nursing will be removed," she- said, 'mournfully, yet confidently. "No; the sooner we give up all hope now, the more time we will have to prepare for an event which cannot, at furthest, be delayed but a few days. I wish to ask you, Mrs. Lovell, before I grow any we aker, if you will be so kind as to keep an eye upon my daughters, and see that they go into the homes of good families. They have    FLORA DISPOSED OF.          237 promised me never to go into the house of their uncle William so long as he keeps that mean Irish thing, and she is growing worse and worse every year, and I don't know what in the world she will come to - some horrid end, I fear. I would not have my daughters near her for any- thing in the world, for her poisonous breath would blight their young lives, like the bleak, cold winds of the north upon the flowers of spring. Sarah spoke so unkindly of me when I was bowed down with the most heart-rending affliction, that I have never forgotten it, and I fear I never shall be able to forgive; still I suppose I must, if I hope to be for- given. Yes, I'll forgive her, forgive her freely; but if you hear of some good place where they can be bound out, to do light work, and go to school some, O, I should be ever so thankful!" she said, as she took the corner of the sheet and brushed away the mist that was gather- ing like a cloud in her eyes. "Why, Mrs. Bentley, they shall not be bound out; they can come and live with me; there is enough for all, and more, and Richard, I think, will be delighted to have them there, and who knows -" She stopped and blushed, and the patient seeing it, and guessing what was} coming, helped her finish the sentence. "Who knows but he might take a fancy to Flora, and marry her. O, if he only would. She, I know, will nake him,'or anybody, a good wiTe. But, Mrs. Lovell, you are too kind in taking such an additional responsibility on your hands, and I fear that Richard may object, on account of the increased expense it will incur," she said, now weeping profusely. "O, no, he won't object, for he is so bashful that he never thought of objecting to any lady. It has always been his desire to find some one who wouldn't object to him; and it may be a help to him, even if Flora should not take a fancy to him, by making him more familiar with them- that is, ladies," she said, not dreaming that Richard was already engaged to the queen of flirtation herself "If I only thought he would not object, I could die happily; but if he does, you will promise me before I die to watch them wherever they are, and advise them the best course to pursue," she said, looking eagerly into the face of her warm-hearted friend. "You can rest assured that he will not object; on the contrary, I feel confident that-he will be greatly pleased to have them there," she replied, while her voice and manner indicated that there could be no doubt of her sincerity, and the ultimate instalment of the fair daughters in the home of Mrs. Lovell. "Flora! '   J238        LOVE ON THE WING, "Mother, here I am! what do you wish?"Flora replied, coming near, and rearranging the covering. "I wish you would call Helen, for she must have slept long enough by this time, and have her come down, for I want to see you both to- gether," she-said, turning her head in the direction of the stairs. "Yes, mother, I ivill," she said, and, going to the stairs, in a low voice, called Helen, who, the very moment 'her name was mentioned, hastened down in dishabille, fearing a change had taken place, and that her mother was dying. "Why, my dear, go and dress yourself,' she said, half-pleased at the comical simplicity of her daughter's toilet. "O, I was afraid you were worse, mother, and I am not now fairly. awake. I'll soon be down again," she said, and, bowing to Mrs. LoVell, whom she had not observed before, hastily left the room. 'Come, Flora, now I want to tell you both that Mrs. Lovell has promised to take you in her home, and I want you to look up to her as to me, your mother, and follow her advice and counsel in all things. Do you say you will?" she asked, gazing earnestly at her children.  "Yes, mother, we will do anything to please you and Mrs. Lovell, who is so very kind," Flora said, and, going to Mrs. Lovell, threw her arms around lher neck, and kissed her lovingly. "But you are not going to die. No, mother, do not think of it," said she, returning to the bedside, and, bending over, kissed her tenderly. "Yes, my dear, I think I have but a short timelonger to stay. Now you both will do as I desire. Go and be Mrs. Lovell's daughters, just as you are mine," she said, and turning her head in the direction of Helen, who stood by the stand dropping the spoon occasionally into the glass which contained the medicine they were to give every hour. "Yes, mother, I will do as you desire me; but, mother, I do hope you won't die, we'll be so lonely without you," she said, as she bent down and kissed her mother's pale cheek, while the tears were stream- ing down her face. "That's right; now I can go contented, thinking that my children are provided for, or at least that they will have a home. Isaac and William, I think, will be willing to reimburse you for their food and clothes; and if they do, you won't be so much of a burden as I at first supposed," she said, looking languidly at Mrs. Lovell. "It will be no trouble or expense to us, even if they don't, for Rich- ard, I'm sure, will think it an equivalent to a good fortune to have them in our home."    MRS. BE'TLEY'S FUNERAL.         238 ",I do so mitch hope he will, and, my dears, you must be good sisters to Richard, and not laugh at his bashfulness, but humor him, and make him think that you are his sisters, adopted by his mother, to be com- pany for him during the long winter evenings." A knock was heard, and the doctor was announced. He came in, and found the patient much lower than when he left the evening previous, probably caused by the exciting scenes through which she had just passed. "You must keep quiet, and be nursed with much care, else there are fears that you will overtax your weak body." "Indeed, I'm well aware that my time is close athand, and it is little good that can be done for me now. "Wall, if you keep as quiet as possible, and do not talk too much, you won't hasten the moment alongquite as fast; for you will go soon enough at the best.

SAAC and his wife ivere there, and William and Richard, and they all stood around the dying bed, watching the flickering light as it trembled in its casket; but at last it released itself, put on wings, and flew to the God who gave it a being. Flora Was inconsolable, and she sobbed and moaned as if her heart would break, yet not a tear could come, though many were erowding against the gates of her indomitable will for egress. As she stood and looked uponl the cold and inanimate remains of her mother, who had through life been so good to her, she wished that she too could die and   f      240         LOVE ON THE WING. join her in. that happy land where children are never torn from their parents, and where sin, and sickness, and death are never known. She thought how near she wasstanding to that dark and mysterious future towards which all are hastening. How uncertain are all terrestrial things, for this was the fifth time that Flora had stood in the presence of death, and mourned for the loss of dearly loved relatives whom she could see no more; but this was the most bitter cup of all, as a kind, fond mother had been snatched away when most her love and counsels were needed to guide the youthful feet of her children in paths of use- * fulness and love. Helen mourned as she had never mourned before, for this loss seemed to afflict her far more deeply than any of the others; and it should, as a mother is more constantly with her children, and they cling to her with that fondness and devotion which a mother's love for her children alone can beget. The life of one is inwrought in the life of the other, making it, so to speak, but one individual; for what does a mother live for, but for those whom God has intrusted to her keeping? Her life is all bound up in those of her children, that every word she says, and every act she performs, is said and done with an eye single to the hap- piness and welfare of them, and they, in return for so much delicate attention, bestow all that tender love of which their young heart is ca- pable. A telegram had been sent to Mrs. Bordman, notifying her of the death of her sister, and she arrived in time to attend the funeral. When she heard how she had labored, both early and late, night and day, her indignation-knew no bounds, and she attributed her death to the fact that she had worked too hard, and had breathed too much the fetid air of sick rooms. She censured William for permitting her to go away, and subject herself to such trials, for fear of being too burdensome on him. Her great pride and self-respect had been the cause of her death, and he, or his Irish virago, was her murderer. They had killed her out- -right. "Why," says William in defence, "I couldn't keep her here. She was determined she would go." You couldn't turn the miserable thing you had in the house out doors, and thus save our sister's life! No, you couldn't do that; you can't do anything that is right and just; and when you found she was killing herself, why didn't you take her back then?"she asked, her eyes flashing fire, and indicating much more passion than she uttered. "I did offer to bring her over, but she refused to come, saying she would rather live where she was," he replied, blandly.,    A GOO)  BUTTER-MAKER.         241 "Of course she would'; for you don't suppose a decent woman would stay in the house with this thing, do you D?" "I was not aware she was so terrible bad before; and she has been here so long, I don't know now how I should get along without her, she is such a good butter-maker." "Yes, I suppose so; there couldn't be any butter made if she wasn't here. I wonder how other folks get along without having her to make their butter for them." "O, theirwives make other folks' butter; and if I had one, perhaps I shouldn't stand in need of a buttear-maker," he said, with a mischiev- ous twinkle in his eye. I suppose there is not another man in the universe who carries on farming, and making butter, without having a wife to make it for him. I know of several. Neither do they keep women in their houses who are a shame and a disgrace to all the people." "It dependsaltogether how a man is circumstanced about that, for if he is rich, he can afford to keep any one; and, as far as I'm con-- cerned, all I've got is my own, when my debts are paid," he said, shak- ing a few keys, and perhaps a penny or two in his pocket.  "Well, then, if that's the case, I wouldn't squander it away on such things as she is. I'd be a man, and live respectablt as other people, and get a man and his wife to take care of the house and the butter. Prettyname she has round the neighborhood now; and it's growing worse, too, every day, Ifind." "O, she don't cost me a terrible sight - only about five hundred dol- larsa year; and that isn't much, I'm sure." "Much! It would hire a man and woman both, and they, too, of respectable characters; and for that I'd rather give a thousand fobr two such individuals in the house than to have this miserable thing stay for nothing." "O, you don't know anything about how much help she is to me; and I doubt very much whether I should be able to find a woman who 'would make such a quality of butter as she is making.. Just think, I get fifteen cents,a pound more than the market value!" "Well, I should rather get fifteen cents less than the market value than to be obliged to pay her that fifteen cents extra, and perhaps ten times as much, and at the same time lose more than the value of all the butter made here in reputation and respectability." "O dear, I wish you wouldn't talk about it any more; for if you, knew how hard it ivas to get along, you would be willing to take up 'with everything in order to get through. I've been in hopes all the 2.1   242        LOVE ON THE WING. while that I would by and by get Richard to marry her; but I'm some afraid he is going to block the game, for he don't seem to want to take any hints; but I'll talk to him about it by and by more plainly, and then if he don't choose to take, her, why, I'll get somebody else." I hope you don't suppose that by marrying her to somebody you will make her better; if you do you are much mistaken; and if anything, it will make her worse than ever; for then she'll think her tenure of office secure, and she can carry a high sail, without any one daring to say a word to her."  "O, wall, I'll fix it in some way, one of-these days, so it will be en- tirely satisfactory to you. I want to get Richard to marry her if I can, and then I guess we can both manage her, and keep her in proper bounds. But, come, you had better be getting ready to go to the funeral, for you have'n't but an hour now." Snow had fallen so there was quite passable sleighing, for it was just in the month of December that the dear mother was buried. It was on the Sabbath, and during the previous night it had rained, and then had frozen an icy covering over everything. The limbs of the trees cracked and snapped as they swayed to and fro in the cold breeze which agitated a little the otherwise calm, blue surface of the lake, and from it there arose a dense volume of vapor, through which the sun but dimly showed his face; and from the meandering creek, as it foamed and tumbled over the rocks, then down some precipice, now over some high dam, the vapor and spray arose, and, wafted eastward by the breeze, looking like some huge serpent, turning this way and that, as if uncertain which way to go, until at last it dissolved in thin- ner and invisible mist. Such was the day on which Mother Bentley was consigned. to her last resting-place beneath the cold damp sod; and it was a day long to be remembered by the poor lonely orphans, who, ever afterwards, when the lake and creek presented such an appear- ance, recalled with a painful remembrance the scene connected with that unusual phenomena. The hearse was driven up to the door, the wheels sliding on the icy ground as they turned the corner by the house, and the coffin was placed gently therein, and moved away a short distance, to wait till the mourners were seated in carriages, then they drove out and waited, until at last all were ready; and the long procession moved on over the hills and through the valleys. Mrs. Lovell was there with her wards, who were sobbing impetuously within the closely. curtained carriage, where not a curious eye witnessed their grief, but all heard how bitterly they wept. Richard. brought up the rear in a carriage   FLORA AND TIET,.N IN A NEW     HOME.    243 alone. He had not seen his mother since she had gone to attend the sick, so he knew nothing of the happy surprise which awaited him at home; for his mother was going to take them home with her, as she had told the uncles that was the wish of the mother. At first they rather demurred at thisthinking it would be too great a tax upon the resources of Richard; but when told that Mrs. Bentley had said, probably, they would be willing to discharge the indebtedness which their sustenance would incur, they relented, and agreed to pay Mrs. Lovell the sum of one thousand dollars a year for taking care of the young orphians, and she in turn stipulated to discharge the onerous responsibility in an exemplary manner, subject to the examination and criticism of the relatives. The procession arrived at the grave, and, as each drove along, they alighted and stood upon the brink, and the little orphans scattered flowers upon the coffin, and they were mingled with the descending clay; they were love-tokens of the affection in which they held their mother. When these last rites were duly solemnized, they all returned to their respective homes, and Flora and Helen to their new one, not less humble than the one they had left; left too, forever, and with their mother, in which some of their happiest days had been spent. Richard's surprise can be more easily imagined than described, when he entered the house that evening and found two pretty little girls, one bathed in tears, and theother sorrowing more deeply than tears could testify; and they were pretty even iitheir grief, for it seemed to chasten them. They looked up, half frightened and half in wonder, as the great stout man entered, his face all aglow because of his exercise, and the cold, bracing air without. "Pretty cold day, mother, for a funeral, isn't it?" he asked, as he rubbed his hands over the warm stove. "Why, these are Mrs. Bentley's little girls, are they not?" "Yes, and I've brought them home to be your sisters. Don't you think you'll like them?" she asked. "O, yes, wonderful well; for you know I always like little girls, and even when they get larger," he pleasantly replied, looking at them kindly through their handkerchiefs, which at times wholly covered their faces. They did not deign to look at him, only as they could cast a furtive glance when he was not observing. "I tell you what it is, mother, you have a nice warm fire here. Come, are you not going to get some supper?I'm deused hungry, and I guess these girls are; but let me see, I must have known them well some time ago, but I've forgotten their names," he said, looking ad-   1 244       LOVE ON THE WING. miringly at them, more lovely, even in grief, than in the sunshine of life.  "I thought you was well acquainted with them"' "No, not well acquainted; but I have seen them occasionally riding out, or playing croquet in the yard, aid I always thought they were remarkably smart and very pretty," he said smiling, and they looked up and smiled half reluctantly. "Their names are Flora and Helen." "They are pretty names, indeed, and they are almost, as pretty as my Sarah," he said, carelessly. "What Sarah?" she exclaimed, in surprise. "What Sarah! Why, indeed, I thought you knew all about her," he said, as his eye involuntarily twitched. "Why, no, I have not the remotest conception to whom you have reference; but then never mind till after supper, and then you can tell me all about it." "That's right, mother, for I'm as hungry as a land shark. Say, mother, do these girls ever talk"  "Can't you ask them and see." "Yes, I will; but maybe they are hungry, and don't want to be' bothered just now." "No, we are not hungry; we only feel bad because our mother is gone," Helen said, sobbing bitterly, and tears flowed unrestrainedly, till supper was announced; and then this grief was partially forgotten while their attention was turned to the good things which Mrs. Lovell had prepared. "O, don't, my dear, feel so bad. I'm sorry, too, she is gone; and if crying would bring her back, I would cry as-hard as you do; but it won't do any good, for she is happier there where flowers always bldom, and where night and winter never come," he said, soothingly. "If it is so pleasant and happy there, why does everybody hate so much to go?" she asked, looking up with eyes swollen, and red with constant rubbing. "It is because life is so sweet, and the world is so pleasant, that we are loath to part with it, for we know not whether we shall be so well satisfied in the other world. We know what we have here, but we don't know what is to be found there." "I think I would as lief die as not if flowers always bloom there, and where winter and night never come." "What makes you feel so bad then for your mother, if you would as lief be there as not?"   GETTING ACQUAINTED.           245 "It is because I'm lonesome; and when I think she is gone forever, it makes the tears flood right into my eyes, and they come so easy that I can't help it," she said, sobbing. "Yes, I know it is hard; for my father died when I was but fifteen years old, and I have had to get along as best I could since. But I never shall forget, to the last day of my life, that death-bed scene," he said, sadly. "Nor I this day. Did you observe the vaporish smoke that arose from the lake, and the winding of the creek could be distinctly traced by the vapor above it?" "Yes, I saw it; but I thought you wouldn't in that close carriage." Come, now, children, let's have some supper. I know you must all be hungry, for I am." "Yes, and so am I; and I guess the girls are too, they look so weak and frail. Come, Flora, you sit on one side, and Helen on the other: there, that's it; now I can wait on you more handily. You have some waffles and honey, and nice warm biscuit. I'll pass these first, shan't I, mother?" "Yes. Do you take tea, Flora?  No, ma'am; I always drink water at home; ma' thought it was best. "Well, here Flora, we have the best of water, and when spring comes again we will take a ride in the boat; I think you'll enjoy it so much." "O, I always did; and it's very kind in you to do so much for us." "It will be more a pleasure than a task, I assure you, and one which I enjoy equally as much as any one." CHAPTER XXXVI. RICHARD AND SARAH.--HE RESOLVES TO MARRY HER. AFTER tea, the company sat and conversed on many little subjects of interest to all, until bed time. The girls were much pleased with their new home, and but for the death of their mother, would have enjoyed the evening very much; and even as it was they began to smile some towards the latter part of the evening, at some of Richard's quaint remarks but the smile no sooner came, than a sombre cloud would sweep across their faces, leaving them all dark again. They looked 21*   I 2 -246     LOVE ON THE WING. weary and fatigued, while their eyes had a sort of dreamy languor, which plainly showed that they had had but little rest for some time; and when Mrs. Lovell suggested something about retiring, they eagerly expressed a willingness to be shown to their room. "I guess you had better occupy the front chamber until we fix the one up stairs," Mrs. Lovell said, as she took a light and led the way into their cosey little parlor, from which a door opened into a bedroom, to the right. Here was a bed, as soft and white hs a bank of snow; and such large pillows! I suppose they had been there for thirty years; at least not in Richard's time had they been taken to do service in an) other part of the house. They could always have been seen, when she had company, lying on the window-sill, in the morning sun; and as she re- placed them on the bed, and patted them down, all nice, she always thought to herself, who would be the next to sleep there. She staid until the girls were snugly ensconced beneath the ample covering, and after tucking up the feet, and kissing the girls, she bade them good night. They were very tired, and they were in so nice a bed, with its span clean sheets, and such an agreeable fragrance from the clean covering, that they soon forgot their grief and their troubles in a quiet slumber: and they looked so loving, entwined in each other's arms, when Mrs. Lovell came to see if everything was all right, that even she could not help expressing thoughts of admiration as she gazed down upon the unconscious sleepers, immersed deep down in the soft and ample feather bed. The jet black and luxuriant hair of Helen fell in waving tresses upon her face and neck, while Flora's longer, and equally luxuriant hair, fell in golden ringlets upon hers and her sister's face, making them look more like two cherubs than like children with flesh and blood. She went back and told Richard that "two such pretty girls never lived before." "Pshaw! I don't know what you'll think when you see my Sarah, for she is as pretty as anything can be." "Why, who is this Sarah, of whom you've been talking lately?Do I know her?" "Know her! Why, yes, you know her well, and you saw her to-day at the funeral. She rode in the carriage with her sister." "Why, not Sarah Perkins?" "She is the identical lady." "You don't mean to say you are going to marry her?" "Mother, I shall marry that lady, as sure as the sun shines." "Never!" "My dear mother, you shock me amazingly."  MRS. LOVELL SURPRISED.         247 "Never! I repeat. Shell never be the wife of Richard Lovell!" "How do you know this?" "How do I know it Common sense teaches me." "It's a wonder it never taught me that." "It is; but you might have seen it, if you would.' "How?" "By looking; for how many has she already mittened?" "Never me; and my hopes are good till I wear a pair." "Thoul't wear them before thou marriest her." "Mother! you speak as one inspired. Tell me, before, your words drive me mad, how you came by this great knowledge." "I've told you already that it was common sense, and it is as free to you as to me; it's given to all." "It's wondrous strange I've never seen any of it, when others more fortunate, but not less likely, possess so much." "You could, but love is blind; and if you had come to me, I could have told you -that she would never marry you'.' "Didn't I ask your advice on this subject once?" "Only about your bashfulness; never about this lady." "My bashfulness was overcome when I met her." "How  " "By her free and easy manners, and by not noticing the blunders I made. These young and crazy girls would as lief torment a fellow even unto death, while she had compassion on me, and took me in." "Yes; you'll be taken in, and in sorrow lament your blind infatua- tion. She has turned many a better man than you from the door, and told him to go - where, I wouldn't tell." "Never! Pardon me, mother, you are mistaken; no, not that. But when I talk so, they tell me I lie." "It's the truth, however unpleasant it may be to you." "Name those she has served thus, that I may compare myself to them, and see if they are better than I." "There was Spencer, poor fellow, and Leslie, and Howard. That's all, I believe i no, it seems to me there was another." "Do you call them better than I." "In some respects, though not stronger, nor more able." "Mother, if I marry her as easy as I can take all three and slash the ground with theme until you'd look in vain to find more than a piece of leather, or a few toe nails, that lady would be my wife ere the setting of another sun." "The days of chivalry afe passed, and such deeds are no longer   l I .248          LOVE ON THE WING., looked upon as worthy and becoming in any man who wishes soon to marry." "I know that, mother, though I didn't say' I would; but I could, if the occasion required; but happily none will arise. You said in some respects they were better; will you name them?" "One is rich, and the other is a minister, while the other is studying for a doctor." "Then wealth makes men better, does it?" "Not better, but more desirable; for, instead of having to go to work' immediately, and wasting their young lives in trying to acquire a com- petence, they can go to living at their ease, and enjoy life a little in their youth."  "Ha! Then mine will have to work to acquire a competence, will she?" "Why, yes, if she ever has it; you certainly haven't it now." "No; but what am I going to do all this while?sit idly down, and see her work P? "Perhaps not; but can you afford to let her sit down and play the lady P? "She wouldn't wish it, if she married one twice as rich as myself, for she wasn't brought up in habits of idleness." ^Very true; but there is a difference in working. Some work be-, cause they are obliged to, others because they like to; and then again some work for recreation when they get tired of sitting still." "I want my wife to work as the last." "Well, if you cani afford it, all' right. But what are you going to do with her? and when are you to be married?" "I'm not going to do anything with her till I marry; but when I am married, I propose to bring her here, to live with you." "Wall, if she don't come here till you marry her, I won't look for her right away." "You may look for her between this and the vernal equinox; and' then I would like to have these children sleep up stairs, and let her have those rooms for herself." "Indeed, I hardly think those rooms will be devoted to every-day use; and then there would be no place for company." "No one sleeps in there more than once in a year; and I don't think it would be a bit too good for her, as she has been'in the habit all her life of being surrounded by nice things; for it certainly would seem a great privation to her to be deprived of those luxuries to which she has so long been accustomed; and I, for one, would be the last to deny ;    SARAH'S LOVERS.           249 her so simple an indulgence, especially as no damage could result to the room and furniture for being occupied only nights, as she would probably prefer to sit with you in the kitchen to being alone in the parlor. Possibly she may consent to live with me at William's; and if she does, why, you can have the house to yourself and wards; or, what was it you called them? Seraphs? No" "Cherubs."' "' O, yes. Strange I never can thing of such words." "But you needn't build any castles upon the supposition that she is going to live with any one there, unless, indeed, it be with the pro- prietor; and if everything I hear is true, it will be some time before she lives there, any way, for with you she won't, and with her he 'won't,"  "Mother, it hurts me very much. to hear you speak of her so lightly, as if she had nothing else to do but to receive the attentions of ad- mirers, and say to this one go, or to that one come. She had good reasons (and I'll take care that she has none in my case) for shipping these -lovers; for one had just come home from the army, after having had the camp fever, and was delirious, or something, and wouldn't kiss her when she came to see him, so she told him he needn't trouble himself about her any more; and he didn't after the memorable even- ing he pleaded so earnestly at her feet. And the other, I believe, came. to see her one evening, tipsy, when she told ,him if he paid more atten- tion to the good of his flock, and less to the bottle, it would be better for them and him. This made him so very wrath', that he unchris- tianly told her that he didn't care if she didn't go where Abraham held the baby -in his bosom. She was naturally pretty quick-witted, and consequently it didn't take her all night to think that that would be a. very desirable place to rest from earthly toil; and acting upon the im-  pulse of the moment, she opened the door, and beckoned to him to make himself scarce; and which he did instanter, nor waited for a second invite; and the other fellow --I believe he wasn't devoted enough in his attentions, or something, and she told him the room was very pleas- ant before he came, and she thought it would be again as soon as he wag gone: and he was gone in a good deal less time than it takes me to tell it, while she stepped to the window and heard him mutter some- thing about the fickleness and instability of a woman's love, and that he would never trouble himself about them any more. She told me this little by little, one evening when she was in pretty good spirits, not thinking that I was taking the whole." "Wall, if she don't, for any of those reasons, she will find some   250        LOVE ON THE WING. other. Did you ever talk to that Irish girl on the .subject of matri- mony?" "No, ma'am, and I never mean to. Didn't you advise me not " "Yes, I did, at first; but afterwards, when hyou stated the induce- ment, I told you to do as you thought best." "The inducement was not considered, neither could there be one sufficient to compensate for so great a sacrifice." "But how do you get along there with them, when it's known by all that it is an object which all are anxious to bring about?" "Not by me, mother, not by me. I use them all as civilly as I can, and whenever the subject is introduced, I either evade it, or pretend not to understand, or excuse it off by some light talk, which always comes in at the right time." "It can't be possible but they think you understand; and if so, they will not let you marry anybody else." "How will they help themselves?" O, it's easy enough; but wait and see if they don't." "We'll see if they do. Do you suppose he would be guilty of doing such a thing as that? Why, many a man has had his brains blown out for stepping between in earnest; and he certainly. can't have any sincere intentions now, seeing he has put it off so long; any way, I'll risk him. Bridget, of course, would do anything; but alone she can't do much damage." "She'll do enough to prevent you from marrying, now you see. Her 'disposition is not going to brook such a slight, without trying to get some revenge." ' I weuld like to betyou a small farm on this, just tosee if I couldn't get rich some way, so she wouldn't have to work so hard right away after being married." It wouldn't make any difference about betting, for if a world were staked on the issue, you would lose." "Time will tell; but if I am not married to her between, this and spring, I shall begin to think that I am not going to. So it ain't a very long time at furthest; and I guess the prize is. worth the trial, without borrowing any trouble about a possible rejection while the chances are so very near." "Not very near; but let us go to -bed, and think upon it, and I guess in the morning you'll begin over again." "Not so long as Sarah lives, or rather is single, for you can hardly imagine how much I love her; and to think that there is but a faint hope that she'll be mine, drives an arrow, steeped in the gall of bitter- ness, right through my heart."   FLORA AND HELFTN SETTLED AT HOME.        251 "O, you'll survive it, I guefs." "Survive it? I hope not, for I don't want to come so near missing as that." "Well, miss it you will, so you might as well school your affections down to that temperature." "Wall, good night, mother: I'll see if I can draw sleep and com- fort out of this. If I do, I can draw them from anything, even from a bed of living coals." Richard went to bed, but not to sleep. He weighed carefully every word and sign of Sarah's, and could find nothing to convict her of in- sincerity, while everything went to confirm more and more the love he entertained for her. It couldn't be possible that a lady of her dispo- sition could so grossly trifle with the love of him who had vowed such true and constant love. No. He would harbor no such evil thoughts against her, for she was too good, and pure, and trusting, to permit, for a moment, such an idea. He would as soon think angels in heaven guilty of treason as she. It could not be, for it wasn't in her nature; even if she had desired to play the flirt with him she wouldn't. At last he worried off into short, fitful slumbers, as comfortless as they were unrefreshing; and he arose, when morning at last dawned, more weary than when he retired. But he would know the worst inl a few days, for he would go down and see; for the knowledge of it would not be half so harrowing as this awful suspense. He could tell in a moment if there were any snakes in-the grass. Richard moved the household furniture over, and it filled the house- pretty well, adding three beds, chairs, and stoves, and a bureau, with stands, mirrors, and everything; and it made the place seem more like home to the girls to-see the furniture, around which clustered so many pleasant, as well as painful memories. Their own bed was put up in a little room, which had been occupied as a kind of store-room for every thing Mrs. Lovell wished to put away out of sight, all the plunder be- ing carried up garret. The room was plenty large enough; and after washing and scrubbing, their old rag carpet was fitted and put dow, the bed put up, at which Richard helped, the curtains hung, the stand on which were their books and drawings, the mirror hung up so they could see themselves, Mrs. Lovell pronounced the room " quite pre- sentable, and she asked them if they would be homesick any more " To which they replied, they" thought not," After everything had been done that Richard could do, he went down to William's, resolving to know the truth, the half of which he had not yet suspected. But before following him, we must look in on other scenes, and see wha has and is transpiring, mitting many little things for want of space.   ' 1 252        LOVE ON THE WING. CHAPTER XXXVII. ISAAC AND  HS CONFEDERATES. SAAC being in town one day, happeted to run accidentally upon Mr. Locker, and not thinking about the business he last had with him, was passing on, when he was addressed by Mr. Locker.. "Say, Mr. Wood; you recollect the conversation we had about a month ago, do you not?" "Let me see; you have reference to that marriage affair?" "The same." "With what success?" "It's neither good nor bad; but perhaps it's worse." "How can that be " "Don't you know that it is better, when you lick a boy, to have him yell, and scream, and bawl as loud as possible, than it is for him to stand and not cringe, but remain as mute as a statue, chawing the cor- ner of his apron?" "Well, yes, I don't know but it is better. But what has this to do with our business?" "Very much, indeed, for that fellow chawed his apron." ' He did, eh? -: ' "Yes, he did; and there is no more use of licking him, than there is to go up to that apple tree and commence licking that." "Didn't he say anything at all " "Yes; but you could put it all in an ounce vial." What were the words?" "I don't exactly remember the precise words he used, they were so few; but they amounted to a good deal." "What did they amount to?" "They amounted to just about as much as this: if I should tell you to mind your business, what do you think it would amount to " "Why, it would amount to my taking my boot away from you; that's what it would amount to." "Well, that's what he told me; and I didn't say anything more to him, because I thought 'twas no use." "Well, sir, of all the men I ever came across, he beats them all." "He certainly is a strange fellow,"    ISAAC AND MR. ADAMS.          253 "Well, I suppose we might as well give it up now; for I don't know of any other hold that wili be of any use." "You hain't tried coercion, have you?" "No; how would you try that?" "I don't know, I'm sure; but if it was my case, I'd invite him up often, and if he wouldn't come, I'd spite him in some way." "You can't spite him at all, for if he can't get one thing, he'll go without; and he just as lief go without as not." "Ha! he is most strange. I'd make him write to her then, and see what effect that would have." * "It won't do any good at all, for we have tried it; he'll write, and that will be the end of it, till I tell him again: he always does just ex- actly as I tell him, all but marry, and that I can't make him do." "It's monstrous strange." "I would be willing to give five thousand dollars to any one if he would only bring this thing around." ' I wish I could do this for you." "So do I  Wall, I'll see you again about this, for I don't want to give it up yet; and I may try some other hold. Good day." "Good day. -What a fool he is to tell me that he made him write letters to her. Such letters must be of a good deal of service, and then, perhaps, he goes around and brags about it; yes, it seems to me now I did hear him say that he hadn't heard anything from him; but he came up home here, and found that the women had received one, just as if he didn't know anything of it before; but it is just like him. "I wish I could see Mr. Jones now, for he is the man for such a job; he likes it, and it seems to agree with him so well; and in fact he isn't easy unless he's inquiring into somebody's business, and maybe he snubbed him more on that account; but he is such a smooth, oily- tongued man, he'd make the worse appear the better reason, when he himself knows better. It isn't possible that he'll be in town to day, for if he was I would have seen him before now; but I'll go and see if Adams is in the office, and if he is, I will hear some encouraging re- port." Thus he soliloquized as he walked along, till he arrived at the door of the office. He walked in and found him there. "Ha! good morning, Mr. Adams. I'p glad to see you. You well?" "Quite well, I thank you. How do Xti do?" "O, quite well, with a little of the blues; my plans don't work very good; have you any good report to make?" "'Well, I fear you won't be much encouraged with what I have to 22   254        LOVE ON THE WING. say. I met William, and argued with him quite lengthy; but he was so stolid, that my remarks had but little effect upon his heart." "You didn't appeal to his heart, did you?" "Why, yes ; love of home, family, name, all one holds most dear: certainly I had to appeal to his heart. What would you address his intellect, or his understanding?" "I would address his conscience; but then it's all well enough: it wouldnrt do much good whichever you address." "Not much; I would as lief go out and talk to that post, for all the effect it had upon him." "What did he say?" "I don't want to tell exactly, for it is neither pleasant nor just, even in this cold weather, a person would think, though he would go right v off and marry in a day or two; but it was only to excuse it off and get rid of me. These easy kind of folks are the hardest to get around; for they palaver around in such a way that a man can't get mad, and yet they'll do just, as they are a mind to about it." "Wall, did he say he would marry?" "No, not in those very words; but he would when he got around to it." "That means that he'll never get around, to it?" "It looks just so to me." "O0, how I wish I could make him get around to it." "You do; and would you do it?" "Would I? Would a dog eat his dinner?" "Yes, if he got it." "And so I would do this if I could." "You'll have to give it up now, I suppose?" "It looks like it. I wish somebody would tell me of a good plan that would bring him to time." "How much would you be willing to give?" "I'll give five thousand dollars." "Only five thousand?" "Zounds! ain't that enough?" "If I had a daughter, and he would marry her, I would give anybody twenty-five thousand to bring it around; and then 'she would be making something out of it." "Yes; but you would be losing the use of your money." "Of course, I'd be giving it to her." "'Not directly." "At some future time she would get it, and more, if he didn't break down; and of that there isn't much danger."  ' ) ISAAC AND MR. JONES.          255' "I don t know. It remains to be seen whether a woman's counsel is always safe or not. / If he dies rich, I'm beaten; and if he dies poor, my advice is, not always to follow a woman's, especially where it is prompted by so selfish an interest." "There is a woman behind the fence, eh?" "Yes, a sister. I would it were not so; but I'm compelled, against my better feelings, to speak evil of her, because I don't think she is fol- lowing a course that will ultimately lead to the good of the family, and the preservation of its name from the malicious ,attacks of the evil- minded; but I'm powerless, and can do nothing, for I've exhausted now all my resources, and can think of nothing more. I have labored hard and faithfully to. preserve our good name from odious slander, but thus far in vain. O, dear, I don't know what I shall do," he said, as he brushed the cobwebs from his eyes. "I'll tell you what you should do. I would do nothing, and shame them by my silence and contempt into conformity with the rules and regulations of society. I would withdraw all intercourse from her who is the author of this mischief; that is, I wouldn't let my family visit her, and I would get all my neighbors and friends to join me inthis resolve. In that way I think you can compel obedience; and then, you see, the ladies will lift the finger of outraged chastity against her, as being ac- cessory to a crime which she must believe everybody thinks is a fact." "Yes, I see. I'll try that next time; but I have no hopes of success now, for my best hold has slipped, and I'm no better now than if I hadn't thought of it. .My trump card is played; and nothing I can now do, I fear, will avail. But say-I must be going. I'll see you again bym-by. So good day to you." ' Good day; and I hope to hear of your ultimate success." "Thank you, I'll do my level best." "If I could only see Mr. Jones now, I'd be right in town," he said, as he closed the door and looked up and down the street. "Perhaps I'd better go over to the hotel, and see if he isn't there lounging around, gossiping about somebody's business which don't concern him. Yes, there he is leaning up against that post, talking to Mr. - , and hearing, I suppose, a good deal of valuable information," he said, as he advanced into the bar-room. "Howdo you do this morning, Mr. Jones " "Quite well, I thank you.' "How is Mr. Wood?" "-Mr. Wood is all right. When you get through, I would see you a few moments." "I'll be with you 1i a moment." And he, Wood, went along and   256        LOVE ON THE WING. took a drink at the bar, then talked a while with some of his friends, until he thought Jones had been talking about long enough, when he went back out that way to remind him, by his presence, of his anxiety. Mr. Jones, seeing this, cut off further remark, and came up to where Mr. Wood was standing, and thus addressed him:-- "I saw your brother, as per agreement, and I represented to him the expediency of marriage, and the objectionable features of a life of celibacy. I told him that a man who chose not to marry, for reasons best known to himself, ought to have a sister, or asman and his wife, for his housekeeper; or otherwise, it would look bad, and if with a person of no moral character, as in this case, it would look far worse. But it was all to no purpose; for the pavement under our feet is not harder than his heart." "What had he to say when you finished?" "The same a reputed son would tell his father after warming his jacket well with a horsewhip. "What's that?" " "To go where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched." "He didn't tell you that?" "No, not exactly in those words; 'but it amounted to the same thing. My advice is to let him go and reap the fruits of his own folly, which he will do sooner or later; for no man can carry such a stiff neck, and get through this world successfully, trampling down and ignoring our most sacred and necessary institutions, for the purpose of gratifying a selfish ambition and his own 'spiteful whim." "It's hard to have to give it up; but I suppose I must, as I can think of no other course which, if followedi would result in victory." "There must be somebody opposing it, or else, I think, the influence which has been brought to bear upon him would have had its weight, and he would have yielded." "Yes, there is a woman, and she is our sister- the last person in all the world who should plot against the well-being of her own family, thus heaping obloquy upon the name she herself once bore, and that of him whose name is graven on the imperishable marble in the village cemetery. She - O, may God forgive me! - the daughter and, sis- ter of respected' relatives, of parents whose remains lay entombed upon the sunny hillside, of brothers, or, rather, brother, who feels a lively interest ir the maintenance of our laws and institutions, and who is doing, and has done, all that could 'have been done, to bring about a state of things such as all right-minded and virtuous people will ap- plaud, while these evilly disposed will remain in sullen silence, or hiss "  L   THE BEAUX DISCUSSED.          257 in scorn. So you can think of nothing which would ultimately crown so desirable an event with snecess " "I hardly know what to say; for I believe you are right, and your brother is obstinately wrong, and anything I can do will be cheerfully done. I pity' you in your distress, and him in his weakness and crime. Virtue, though, will triumph, and wickedness perish from off the earth, but when, neither you nor I can tell." "Well, I must go to work and figure out some other plan;' for I don't intend to let this rest now I've begun it, and after having pro- gressed so far." "I glory in your pluck; and if perseverance will overcome all diffi- culties you cannot fail, for you have worked with an unflagging zeal, worthy the cause you have so,zealously espoused." CHAPTE R 'XXXVIII. rELLT E.N AND SARAH HAVE A PLEASANT TALK. N evening or so after the day on which the scene recorded in the last chapter took place, Ellen and Sarah were seated. in their sitting-room by a cheerful fire, conversing on the manner, in which William received the suggestions of his neighbors. "I should think he would feel ashamed of himself; and to think that these men, on going home, told their wives about it, and commented on his taste for harboring such a mean thing, so utterly at variance with all morality," said Ellen, while a cloud of indignation mantled on her brow. "We will let him go now, for I think he is past all hope of salva- tion; though it is a consolation to think that I won't be left entirely in the lurch, as I have Richard yet; and I guess, on the whole, it will be a good exchange. Of course I would rather have William, if I could get him; but if I can't, why, I must do the next best thing," she said, pleasantly. "Richard, you think, will do, eh?" she asked, in a sneering tone. "Why, yes; I don't know but he is as good a man as William is. True, he isn't as rich; but wealth does not make all happy, you know. Would you not be willing to accept a more humble sphere, than to en- dure all the abuse and ill-treatment you receive from IsaacP" she asked, her eye brightening. 22    258        LOVE ON THE WING. "Wall, yes, I don't know but I would; providing,'however, I had enough to eat and wear, without slaving myself right down to never- ending work. I should like to visit some, and have some relaxations; and if a man would give me these, and love me well, it is all I would ask," she said, with a sigh. "Those are just my sentiments, exactly. Now, what is the 'use of waiting for, and then being fooled, by William? Tell you what it is, it ain't quite so pleasant to have a man use me in that way; but if I get at him at last, I shall consider myself well paid'for all I have here- tofore endured. Now, I think the best way would be to let him drop from our calculations, and devote,our attention to one who, I think, is worthy some love, especially if that is to be returned for what is given; for he certainly has given to me his whole heart and soul," she said; and as she said it, more than common love kindled in her eyes. "Wall, it is just as you're a mind to, for you are the one most con- cerned by it; and as you feel, so you should act, regardless of our wishes, as you can tell more truly, by your feelings, than we by our interest. But as you said you would-rather have William, if you could get him, I think you had better wait, say till next fall, - that will be pretty near a year, and in that time something may happen to our advantage; and if something-should, why, we want to be in a condition to profit by it," she said, with a low,/ knowing bow. "O, wall, I don't believe in waiting for dead people's shoes; for it looks as if we had no ambition of our own to take up our share of the responsibilities of the world. We will have some trouble in any sphere of life: the sun don't always shine, and clouds make sunshine more welcome. What would earth be, but for night, and darkness, winter, storm, wind, and rain? All these are necessary t9 the relish of them- selves. Suppose the sun never sat; wouldn't we tire of perpetual light-and heat? Night comes to break the monotony, and makes us glad at the sight of the rising morn. Suppose we had no rain, or, storms, or wind -we would have to make pleasant weather gloomy in order to accommodate it to our feelings, in order to make it unreal and unnatural, which of itself would be anomalous. Of all winds, though, the south wind is the meanest, and, seemingly, the most unne- cessary; for it blows as if it were to spite us, when it ought to know that we -don't care. It might blow longer, and with less fury, if it would, and not spend itself in vain attempts to drive us mad. It blows so hard, and dashes the waves up against the stony bank with such violence, that it seems as if it owed us a grudge, and was bound to exact the last farthing; but it comes so often, and in its usual fury,   SENTIMENTS ON MARRIAGE.          259 that we fear the debt is more than paid; and that if anything is- due, a little more moderation is due our forbearance," she said, ironically. "We will have to take such things as they come, and put up with them; but marriage is a thing we can govern and control. We needn't marry unless we choose, and we can accept a good chance, and reject a poor one, - this is our privilege; and the next thing to be considered is, are we, in the absence of good offers, bound to accept a poor one? No! better remain single, and live out the life as webegan it, alone," she said, as a misanthropical look darkened what would otherwise have been agreeable features. "No, Ellen, I shall not agree with you in that; for, suppose every woman should think thus, who would marry? Life is made of homes, and families, scattered abroad throughout all the earth, each striving in its own way to obtain a living and be happy: some get this and more, who commenced life young and poor, and are both ornamental and use- ful in the world, in more respects than one; for, by marrying, a woman takes her place by the side of the families of the world, and if she is not as fortunate as her more favored sister in getting one who can figure close and acquire wealth, she has this to smooth her dying pil- low: 'I knew my duty, and I did it, not grumbling when I found the -task harder than I thought; for though my labor has been great, my trials insufferable, yet my life has been honorable, and my cause is just' How much better that sounds, than will be my lament when death comes to take me away, should I, by my pride and obstinacy, permit a golden opportunity to pass unheeded by, which, perhaps, will never again be presented? 'I knew my duty, but I was afraid I'd have to work too hard; yet it is a consolation that no one is left to mourn me, and no one to take the place I have so discreditably filled. O, that I could live my life over again! far different would be the course I would pur- sue!' I contend it's!better for a woman to marry, and have a home of her own, if it's no more than one room, with a small bed in the corner: it's hers, it's her paradise, where all the dear, fond comforts of a home can be had, though in limited supply and in meagre appearance; yet it is home, and she is queen of it. If she can't be happy there it's her fault, not the world's, for the world gives her all it has to bestow- a fertile soil, a sunny sky, and falling rain. They are hers, to make much of or little, as she chooses. She has her choice, and I have mine; mine I'll follow, and leave old maids to their doom, the grave, to which they will go unloved and unmourned, and, perhaps, what's worse than all - if it was their own wilful, obstinacy, despised," she said, decidedly, while a look of determination and heroism glowed upon her pretty face, worthy a better fate. "   260        LOVE ON THE WING. "It's a pity you are not a man, for such sentiments as those would carry one through the world without help; and a man who possesses such a spirit, if placed upon the world anywhere, would get a living and die happy. Wall, if you are determined to paddle your own canoe, go ahead, and may you be successful and happy. I don't think Richard will make the worst husband, nor the best; but perhaps, on the whole, he'll do well enough; for you certainly will have a home, and a good, nay, loving treatment, as long as you both live; And I believe he would sooner lose his right hand than wound or offend the woian he loves; for when he loves, he loves with the whole ardor of his soul; and when he hates, - if indeed he hates any one, - he hates with all the malignity of his being; and no wife need ever fear him, or that her lot will be worse than other wives, for she can mould him as she will, and his love to her will be the same as hers to him, - pure, gentle, confiding as a lamb's. I have said this, though reluctantly, for I believe it's justice due him. He will make a good husband; but he will never be a fash- ionable man, a man of the world, and for this, and this alone, I object to him. I want you to marry a man who will enter with zest into all our parties, and not be a clog, nor a boor, nor a damper on the fe elings of those present, who come together to have a real good time; for one such a sedate and reserved spirit as his would throw a cloud, as it were, over the gayest scenes, through which the light of happiness and mirth could not come. Take him at home, in the family circle, by the side of a cheerful fire, with happy faces smiling around him, and he's good enough; better thus than light and frivolous; yet it isn't always at home that a husband is wanted. He ought to be willing to visit with his wife the neighbors, for an evening, and be able to entertain one or more of the company, either by extracts from his historical reading, or anecdotes from travellers, or from the biographies of great and illustrious men, statesmen, warriors, and heroes: that's the kind of a man for me," she said, with a chuckle in her voice. "Ha, and you have him, I suppose you think! one who never deigns to go with you anywhere, who never visits with you a relative or friend, except it is in some business which, by your presence, you can facili- tate; whose evenings are spent either in bar-rooms, restaurants, or club-rooms ; who seldom sees his wife from morning till night, unless he wants to blow her for the faults of some one else, and then the quicker he's gone the more he is loved: this is your ideal of a man and a hus- band. But give me the home-tied man for the long winter evenings, he who is there continually playing with his children, unless his busi- ness calls him away, then I would be the last to say no; but for pleas- 'i. 7.   ISAAC SCOLDS.           261 ure, it's no place for a man outside the family circle, for he should take his pleasures where all those most dear to him can enjoy them too: that's my idea of a man and a home, and it is my ambition to get such a husband and such a home if I can. There, your beloved husband is coming in; seeing it's about bedtime." Wall, what is the subject of debate to-night?" he asked, in rather too loud a tone for a fine, delicate nature to hear. "We were talking about William and Richard, and the prospects generally," Ellen said, smiling. "Yes, you are always talking of something ybu don't understand; for my part, I should think you would leave such subjects to those who can solve them practically, not be always harping about them."  . "I'm sure we've showed our good will in trying to brinf the recreant to a sense of his duty, by not only preparing to enter upon the sacred duties of life, but also urging others to do likewise. What more would you have us do?"Sarah asked, pettishy. "I would have you stop blabbing quite so much about it to every body you meet; it's all over town now, and every body is talking about how Will gave us the mitten, and how I tried to get him back by se- curing the influence of all the rich men in town on our side, and how I made him write to you when he was off last winter. For my part, I've said and done all I shall do about it-there. You may plot and plan all you're a mind to, but I'm- done, now recollect it; for not another word will I say. I don't believe in being a butt for the laughter and ridicule'of the whole town. It's notorious that he is a fool, and every'. body elde-is a fool for having anything to say to him. He is devoid alike of the first principles of a business man, and the morals of a gen- tleman; and the less we have to do with such a man the better it will be for him and us. He couldn't address those gentlemen who con- sented to speak to'him on the subject politely and civilly, but he must add to his already sufficiently odious name the charge of being a men- dacious rowdy," he said, indignantly. "Wall, I suppose they made him mad by pressing the subject further than was necessary. It would make anybody mad, even if he intended to comply, to press it too far," Ellen said, pleasantly. "He had no business getting mad. If a man steals a horse, he don't go into a rage, and insult the officers of the law." "No; because it wouldn't do him any good, and it might damage him still further. You don't compare William to a horse-thief, do you?"Ellen asked, rather sadly. "No, but there are many horse-thieves in many respects better. I   + . 262           LOVE ON TIE WING. don't know now of only one course left to you, and that, is, we-will-cut off all intercourse with her family, and get all the rest of the Woods around to do the same. She will come down every year or so, and maybe she'll take the pains to write' the relatives and friends to visit her; and then you can say to her, that you hardly think respectable la- dies can visit at such a place without incurring the risk of losing their own good name, by tacitly countenancing such an objectionable life," he said, more pleasantly. "Capital! We'll do this the very next time she comes down, and it can't help but have an effect upon her sensitive nature. Sarah don't feel inclined to wait thus long for fear she may lose both him and Richard; what do you think about it? Had she better wait? This has gone on now a good while, and the longer it goes the more impossible it be- comes," Ellen said. "If she is in such a hurry, let her step off with Richard, and see how she likes it. I'd rather have her marry him than anybody else besides William; but it will be time enough to marry him, after we find out that we can't get William." "Yes, but it will be some time before you know to a certainty about William, and in the mean time Richard, of course, will get sick of wait- ing, and give it up," Ellen continued. "Let him; if he can't wait upon her till she thinks herself ready, let him go. She needn't cut him right off, you know, but delay it upon various pretexts, until hope itself has died, and then marry him. What do you think, Sarah, don't you think you can keep him along?" "Yes, of course I can. I can keep him along ten years, if I'm a mind to, for he is the best fellow to mind you ever saw," she answered, proudly. "It is understood, then, that Richard is to be retained until we know what will be the result of this last scheme;. for he is in no hurry, and you are in no hurry, and, as William says, it is only a mat- ter of time, and a few days either way won't make any difference to either of you. She Won't care much for that little spite in not visiting with her, because she can visit alone with herself, asking no odds of anybody; and all the way it will affect her will be the influence of public opinion, and, her heart against this will become steeled in time; and the longer a person labors to persuade himself that crime is right, the more used to it he becomes,. and the better it looks. I'll bet that neither she nor him will have quite as much money in five years more; and, if I'm rightly informed, he'll have to sell that farm of his before the year is out, as he ran in debt for the most of it, and hasn't paid anything on the principal yet."   BORDMAN SNEERED AT.           263 "Why! Whom do you mean P." "I mean Bordman; who did you suppose " "I Couldn't tell which; neither could anybody." "Wall, you know now it's him. I wouldn't be afraid to bet a hundred thousand that if this abominable iniquity continues much longer Bordman will break down poor, and the whole family will be here liv- ing on William; for she can spend all the money she has, and all Wil- liam has, if he'll give her a chance. A good deal remains to be seen yet; and it will be quite interesting to others, if not to them," he said, rising, and going to bed. There's your amiableness for you. I would rather spend one evening in the kitchen of a small house, in social, happy chat, than to live a lifetime with such an outlandish boor; and all he married you for, was because you were unfortunate, and he thought you would feel suffi- ciently grateful to him for the favor of marrying his gracious majesty; that you'd be willing to endure all through life, without a murmur of regret or word of complaint, his cutting sarcasms, his stinging rebukes, and worse than all, his ungovernable passion. He knew better than to take one of spirit, - one who would resent his insults on the spot, in the same manner they were given. He ought to have married Bridget, or one of a similar temperament, and then, I guess, he would have had his match. It took old mother Bragg to give him Hail Columbia, and she could do it, too, in a manner not unbecoming when addressed to him; but all such high-mettled personages are very careful whom they select for life-partners, and they are quite sure if they can find one, to get one who is meek and mute, and who will take their curses for blessings, and their sneers for love; but give me love at all times, in storms and in sunshine," she. said, and drawing a deep sigh, relapsed into reverie, until her sister, waking from her's, said, - "I don't think such language at all becoming you; for what would you have been to-day but for his kindness?" she asked, and compress- ing her lips, awaited an answer. "I would have been married to some good, honest man, and been blessed, instead of cursed, by a ever-ending intrigue, with a happy home, dutiful children, and a kind husband," she said, her features lighting up with joy. "Yes, and perhaps you'd be drawing a baby-cart 'along after you to the store, or in your rounds of visits," she replied, with a sneering em- phasis on the baby-cart. "And if I were, it's no more than others have done and been happy, neither thinking it irksome, nor oppressive," she replied, as a frown gathered upon her brow.   ft-    264 .       LOVE ON THE WING. "O, wall, don't let's think of it any more, and get William if you can; and if you can't, do the next best thing," she said, more pleas- antly. "Yes, and while I'm waiting for him, my chance will be gone, and my doom signed, and bealed, and delivered, which I persistently refuse to accept, yet must; and in it is written the ill-fated words, 'Thou'lt never marry! '" she continued with a mournful sigh, that would have brought teais from the hardest heart; yet the muscles of her sister's face didn't move; so firmly had she sealed all access to her heart, that not'one pitying sympathy could escape, nor one sympathizing tear fall; for she had so long schooled her mind to the belief that she should marry William, that it had changed all those finer feelings of her na- ture into a stern resolution to pursue, at all hazards, this, the cherished desire of many years; and she could receive with no patience a word that tended directly or indirectly to discard William, and take up with a less desirable man; and this may have been partially occasioned by her own unhappy choice, and the fear that she would be equally as unfortu- nate should she marry any other than William Wood. CHAPTER XXXIX. WILLIAM  AND BRIDGET ON MARRIAGE. IT is now two years since this, the principal plot of this interesting game, was commenced, and William looked with fear and trembling upon the unshrouded future, which loomed up at times before him in all its spectral unsightliness, and he began to regard Richard with dis- favor, and finally, at last, with distrust; but Bridget still had hopes, although nothing had been said by Richard to her; and at times even half a year would pass without a word being exchanged between them, caused by a burst of ill temper, accompanied by a volloy of foul and profane words; and she had attributed all this to obstinacy, which would soon be overcome by his desire to settle himself comfortably in life, and marry a good wife; and she scrupled not to think that such a one she would make, and she even told him he never would find a better. Richard thought differently, and he proposed, seeing he was the one most interested, to try and see; consequently, he had paid no at-   WILLIAM AND RICHARD REVIEWED.         265 tention to this or her since he had been engaged to Sarah. But before we introduce Sarah again, we want to take a look in the dining-room of Willlam, first without Richard's presence, and then with it; for all know, at least those who have been engaged in such romances, that the presence of a'third party often spoils what otherwise would be fun. Somebody has said that two were a company, and three a crowd, or something to that effect. It should also be borne in mind that, though Richard was engaged to Sarah, neither William nor Bridget knew any- thing of it; and not until it was told to William by Isaac did he entertain a thought that she would accept of him, especially in view of their own recent attempts to marry him; for, though William had not been told who was the instigator of the influence that had been brought to bear upon him, still he was not such a dead head as not to know that it was Isaac himself who was so deeply interested in his affairs. It was Isaac's intention, when he told William of Richard's engagement, to spur William up to a sense of his own danger, if he felt at all de- sirous of getting a good wife; and this effect it had, as will be seen when we come to it. We have only had a glimpse of the two notorious characters alone as yet, and it wouldn't be doing them justice if we should thus slight- ingly omit to record their commendable thoughts and doings; and for this negligence they might withhold from us that admiration which we are sure the recital of this story will create; and we would be very loath to lose one jot of that worthy regard which the narrator of fic- tion is sure to receive from the least of his subjects. When William first proposed this to Richard, he was very good and kind to him, and everything was deferred to his judgment. Was any- thing lost or misplaced, ask Richard about it. Had we better plant this or that field to corn?Would you plough up that meadow, or let it lay another yearP Shall we run a fence here, or there Had we better keep Mike, or let him go P These, and hundreds of other similar questions, were propounded to Richard, which he answered as wisely and as modestly as his wisdom and good nature would permit, William thinking every day he would make some demonstration towards her, the unworthy representative of the Green Isle; but time passed on very rapidly, and no sign of Rich- ard's love was discernible; and various methods were resorted to, to bring him into her presence, and then the signs betrayed the indiffer- ence of his heart. He did not absolutely reject her, - except what could be gathered from his long silene e; and this could not be construed into a complete rejection of her, for the quarrels of lovers were only the 23    266       LOVE ON THE WING., renewing of love, and the course of true love never did run smooth, nor accept her; but he was on the fenee all the while, except when he stole off in the dead of night, alone and a-foot, and not to be caught, as William had been, when going to see the same worthy personage. But he was often missed, and a very large rat was sometimes smelt, yet no one dreamed where he was, or that he seriously intended fore- stalling them by a marriage, of which they knew nothing; still Richard knew his own secrets, and he meant to keep them. During the year past William had been rather sthen towards Rich- ard, but he, knowing the cause, paid no attention to it; and not until William began to mutter, in short, bitter, and indirect sarcasms, did Richard retort, when he immediately subsided into his usual sullen reti- cence. He had not been invited in of an evening, to take a social glass with William, who began to think that as coaxing would do no good, he would try what effect there was in constraint of the milder kind; for it would not do to push him too far, for fear that he would bolt entirely, and which he did do twice under the coaxing system; but under the ether, he fought him bravely on the spot, using with much effect the weapons William feebly handled. Neither had anything been said to him, only in an indirect manner, by William, as he had left that with her, thinking that she would man- age him better than he could; but when a good chance presented itself, during the daily routine of life, William hinted at it as a desirable. and possible thing; and if she ever happened to come into their presence, or drive along the road in sight of them, William turned suddenly, and looked long and admiringly at her, which Richard noticing, would not imitate.  He was not now deferred to as he had been the year before, neither was he asked any questions relative to the best course to be pursued; but this was determined in secret conclave, either with Bridget or alone; and if Richard ventured to make any suggestions, a short, indirect, none- of-your-business kind of answers would be received; but he never had occasion to deliver more than one or two such replies, and when he reads these few words, as he undoubtedly will, either to his shame or glory, he'll think, probably, that Richard is not very far in the rear after all; for though he has not heard very many bitter things from Richard's mouth, this may be the bitterest pill he has ever been called upon to swallow; and even this cup was held to his lips, and on con- ditions which he very well understands, withheld; and yet the condi- tions were coldly refused, and here's the result. And these conditions were not hard, nor exacting, and could easily-have been complied with, (without loss to his finances or injury to his moral chariacter.   BRIDGET'S MAN(EUVRES.          267 "Well, you see now, it is just as I told you some time ago, that if you didn't hurry, and make sure of him on the start, it would grow more and more difficult as time went on," William said, looking pleas- antly. "I wonder if you think I was goin' to urge him to marry me. If you do, you're much mistaken, fur I wouldn't do that to the best man as ever lived, so I wouldn't," she said, frowning. "No, I didn't want you to do that; for all you need to have done was to use him well, and I would do the rest," he said. "Wall, I wouldn't do that either; fur do you suppose I'd make him think I was such a nice good woman, when I wasn't? No, sir. I'd let him know exactly what I was, and then, if he wanted me, he could take me," she replied. "Wall, if that's the way you propose doing, you'll never marry, for any man, at least most men, want wives who are good to their faces, as well as behind their backs. Sometimes you speak well of him, when he isn't around, and then again, when you ought to be as good as you can, you are right the other way." "Wall, suppose he don't merry me, what are you goin' to do?" she asked, casting at him a look of mingled tenderness, love, and sorrow. "Why, I'm not going to do anything, except to keep right along just as I am," he replied, with care. "An' then, do you suppose I'm goin' to stay here, an' have all the folks a talkin' about me? No, I hain't. Now, you mind that, will you?" she said, with a mischievous twinkle in her eye. "Wall, if you don't, then you won't, that's all; but I'll get along some way," he said, as blandly as the meaning conveyed would permit. William was no fool, if he was soft on the woman question; and he knew quite well what she was driving at, and it would affect just as much the interests of Mrs. Bordman to hae him marry her, as it would a re- spectable lady, and to the choice there could certainly be raised some very serious objections, which would not say much in favor of Wil- liam's tastes; consequently, it was not only the wish of Mrs. Bordman that he should not marry at all, but above all things, not her: there- fore it was William's policy to encourage no hopes on himself, and yet retain her at work; and in this he succeeded but partially, for she would take it into her head to absent herself for a week or two, il the hope that, to get her back, he would manifest some sign of his love. She had followed this course now for two years, and she, like Wil- liam toward Richard, and Isaac towards William, was about to inau- gurate more stringent measures; and these measures, because of ner   268        LOVE ON THE WING. moderate sagacity, and the friendliness of her situation, as well as the loneliness of it, will be rather of a more immodest character than any. of the other aspirants employed; and a good deal of this must be in- ferred from distant allusions, because it will hot do to write the words this person did not scruple to employ; and yet, I fear, I shall be un- able to convey but a very faint impression of the moral abasement of 'this woman, because of the circumscribed limits in which I shall be compelled to confine myself. And it must be remembered, also, that this is not the only evening in which the scenes recorded in this chapter take place, but on every, and all occasions, whenever an opportunity presented itself; and sometimes they were not well chosen, as she was often heard to say things, and do things, which society and the law only permit those who hold marriage certificates to say and do. But these had amounted to nothing, as William was as inaccessible to her on the marriage question, as he was to Isaac, and as Richard was to him; and when she had tried every resource in vain, she, though not like the rest, was going to try them all, and to keep trying them over and over again; for as long as life lasted she could keep on try- ing, and be no worse pff in the end than when she commenced, because, as she had nothing to lose, she had everything to gain, and she couldn't lose what she never possessed, and that is, a good reputation. She had learned, by experience, that she needn't be as chary of her words and manners to William, as-she would have done had she stood in dread of being shipped. At first she was good - that is, good for her, and better than she ever was afterwards; and as she found that it did no good, she began to grow a little worse, going off down home, to receive there a blessing from her parents, who heard, in fear and trembling, the course their daughter was pursuing; but the place had so many attractions, and it was so desirable to secure a permanent home, that, as she gave a flattering account of the progress of her in- trigue, they reluctantly consented to let her remain, and acquire, if possible, the heart of Richard, if not the hand of William. Sometimes she got her anger up to so high a pitch, that it seemed the house would fall, and bury them all beneath its ruins; and at such times she used words and phrases that the wickedest trembled in dread of approach- ing torments, and the most licentious blushed for very shame. Such a storm might arise in the morning, and at evening it would be all bright and clear, a dead calm prevailing; and then would be-enacted a scene right the reverse of the one which happened in the morning, and instead of a tempest, raging with all its fury, she would smile the sweetest, and speak the blandest words. While seated upon his lap,   WILLLAM  AND BRIDGET SCUFFLE.        269 she stroked his chin, or smoothed his gray locks, when she would- say, - "Don't you think I would make a good enough wife for you? I'd be so good; you know,-abd we would have such a pleasant time, all here by ourselves. Come,.can't we strike up a match, and let old Richard go," she asked, kissing his brow. "Wa-ll, I don't know but you would; but, you see, it's like this r I have a good deal to do, and but little time to do it in; so if you would only wait, and see whether Richard will marry or not; and ifnot we'll do the best we can," he said, trying to put her off, but she clung to his neck and would not permit herself to be thus treated, and said,- Now you don't like me, or you wouldn't treat me so, and it ain't fair, while I'm trying to be so good to you, and doin' all I can to make it pleasant for you. I don't, think its fair," she said, poutingly, and with a good deal of love. "Wall, I know it ain't; but you see I'm so circumstanced that I couldn't possibly at present think of it, for it would disarrange all my plans, and frustrate all my hopes of the future," he said, more wittily than her feeble comprehension could grasp. "Why, I can't see as it would. I don't know of any plans that would be affected by it," she said, abstractedly, "No, I know you don't; but I'll tell you some time, if you won't bother me now, for I've some writing to do that I can't put off any longer," he said, trying again to push her off; but she clung to him, and in the scuffle tipped over the chair on which he was sitting, while she tried to kiss him, as he struggled among the chairs, until, he being the strongest, she was compelled, from sheer exhaustion, to give up a contest that reflected no credit upon either. These scuffles occurred quite frequently, not only in the evening but during the day, whenever they happened to come together alone, and the result would tend more to excite a morbid passion, than to deaden it; and this was her object, as she had tried in vain the effect of love and anger, and the fear that she would leave him and stay away, all of which were futile; for she was as willing to come back as he was to have her.-  She was far too intimate with him, while he hadn't the will to deny her liberties, which, though not entirely unpleasant, were certainly not proper between them, and only permissible between married people; but these scruples didn't prevent her from attempting to get a position which the rich and the accomplished were atthe same time trying to ob- tain. All the objections therewere aboutitwere the means she employed, 23 *   270        LOVE ON THE WING. which, in her condition, was sinking her lower and lower in public opinion. The wife and mother has privileges which no one pretends to deny her. It was not at all uncommon for her to move about in dis- habille, not only before him, but also before any of the male members of the household. But even these privileges did not bring about the desirable result. Perhaps another storm would be good, and then another display of love, and he must give up, for no man ever held out against them all; but he did, and he was proof against all her bldndishments to his credit be it recorded. The same can hardly be said of manythers. and if said, but few would believe. Perhaps some will thinklye not well enough versed on the subject to pronounce accurately upon so grave a charge; but I trust my reputation for veracity will be a suffi- cient shield to guard me from the unjust aspersions of ignorant vili- fiers, who have heretofore been very loud in their declamations against the rising scandal of the house, between which and it I have these long years stood, in order to hush the one and protect the other.  CHAPTER XL. ISAAC AND WILLIAM    ON MARRIAGE; WILLIAM     AND RICHARD. IT was resolved to tell William of Sarah's engagement with Richard, and see what effect that would have. No one expected any very great advantage from it, but it wouldn't do any hurt to tell, and see what he thought of it. So one day Isaac sent all the loafers out of the office, on the pretext of having some business to transact with William, and when all were out, and he had locked the door, and after trying the door of the safe two or three times to be sure that no one was listening, he said, "Wall, I suppose you have about given up marriage now, hain't you?" "Wall, I don't know. I haven't thought much about it of late," he answered, slowly, but without fear. "Yes, I suppose so, for I never knew you to think of anything that you was wanted to think of; but if you could think of something that anybody didn't care whether you did or not, why, that would be just the very thing yop would want to think about, and you would be mad   WTLLIAM'S EYES OPENED.         271 as thunder'if you couldn't interest somebody else in it, and make them feel the same solicitude about it as you do," he said, rapidly, and with some emphasis. "O, I don't know about that. I haven't engaged in many very bad enterprises, and if I have, the loss has fallen upon myself. Enterprises in which money has been made, would be more commendatory than otherwise, if I was solicitous about it on the start," he said, slowly, as if he was reviewing the past. "Wall, I don't want to talk about that; but I want to know what you really mean to do; for if you are going to marry, I want to know it, and if you ain't, I want to know it," he said. "Wall, I've a good deal to do just now. If it could be deferred till towards spring, I should be much obliged," he said,%mildly, as he filed his finger nails. "Well, we've got through deferring, unless you want to marry; and if you do, we would like to hear some statement to that effect, and we want your acts to conform to it." "That's the way I always intend doing, for I believe it's better to promise little and do much, than it is to promise much and do little." "You do, eh? Well, then, I should think it was time you commenced performing some of the promises you made in years back," he said, his face lighting up. "So I will, if you won't be quite so impatient. A fellow wants time to do all these things; that's all." "Yes, time. I've heard that song sung as long as I'm going to, in regard to this, for she is going to marry either you or Richard Lovell, it makes no difference to me, and very little to her," he said, in great anger; at the same time rising up and shoving back his chair with a crash, and two or three others, which didn't happen to stand in the right place. "Ha! Richard, eh?P I didn't think he was going to marry so well as that," he said, as his face darkened. "Yes, Richard, the one to whom you thought you was going to' mar- ry your dumb Irish thing up there ; but you didn't quite come it; as it happened he didn't- have such a monomania for Irish girls as you have," he said, himself encouraged, as he observed the change in Wil- liam's face. "I'm glad to hear Richard is going to do so well; as for me, I wish him to get a good wife, and I believe Sarah will'be all that. But I had entertained a hope that when Sarah married I would be the bride- groom," he said, with a tone of sadness in his voice.   272        LOVE ON THE WING. "Wall, it's too late now, for she is determined to marry no other than Richard," he said, his eye more bright than before. "Wall, then, there is no use of urging the suit ally further, I sup- pose," he said, more pleasant than before. "None whatever," Isaac replied decidedly. "Well, all I can say is, I'm sorry," he said. "What are you sorry for?" "Sorry that Richard is going to marry; for I've entertained hopes that he would marry and stay with me." "You'll have to give up that now. So you are only sorry that she is going to marry, eh?" "Yes, I'm sorry both are going to marry; but if he wasn't, it ain't likely she would, and if she didn't, it ain't likely he would; so there it is. Well, I don't suppose there is any help for it." "None that I think of" Here the conversation dropped, and nothing more was said between the brothers on the subject, except occasionally a short withering rebuke from Isaac for living in that way. William went home, medi- tating on his next best step. He sought the confidant of his secret thoughts, and the two, after some debate, came to the conclusion that it wouldn't do to have Richard marry just then; at least, not until it had been fully demonstrated that he never would marry Bridget. So they concluded to invite him in some evening, and talk the subject over; for this was the first intimation William had that Richard really intended marrying outside of his wishes, and it affected him deeply, so on this occasion more pains had been taken to have a good time. The table stood in the middle of the floor, and on it were placed the whis- key, sugar, crackers, pickles, bread and butter, cold slaw, gingerbread, and fried cakes. "Wall, you see, Richard, we have some of the good things left yet," he said, as he complacently gazed upon the viands spread out so temptingly before them. "Some! I should think you had them pretty near all. What do you propose doing with all this?" "With your help, I think we shall be able to do away with some of it. What do you say; do you think you can take a handF" "Wall, I rather think I can, and perhaps I can take a hand-full; but, if I should take an equal portion of what's on that table, before the rise of the morning sun I would be a corse." "O, wall, we don't mean to have this all stored away to-night, for if it was, and should be kept up, we would soon eat ourselves poor.   RICHARD PERSISTENT.          273 Well, here, take this glass," he said, handing him half a pint of clear whiskey. "No, I thank you, I would rather pour out my own. There, you take that yourself, and I'll fix another." "That's pretty good, ain't it?" "It does very well; but it all tastes alike to me. It's some time since, we had a drink here before." "Yes: rather, I heard yesterday you was about to marry: is that soP" he asked, lifting the glass, and taking a sip, and then smacking his lips. "Wall, yes, I hope so: how did you hear of this?" "O, I heard of it the same way I hear of everything; somebody told me." "Who ever told you, he had better have been telling you something else. Did you hear anything else?" "No, not of importance; but you are foolish to spend your time there," "Why? Is she not worthy of my attention?" "Yes, if you get her; but you might as well try to get yonder moon, swimming through the sky." "The moon! Why, I couldn't possibly get the moon." Of course not; and you can't possibly get her." "But you haven't told me why." "Wall, in the first place, she is very ambitious; in the second place, you haven't money enough; in the third place, it would conflict with the wishes of outside parties; in the fourth place, she wouldn't marry you anyway." "Did you. hear her say this " "No, but I have it from as good authority." "Who?" "Common sense." "I thought your sense was all your own, not common." "Wall, it is, but this time they happen both to agree. But I thought you was going to marry, and stay here; you know I offered to give you possession, as soon as you married, so I could take a trip off for a while." "I had no objection to marrying, providing I had a choice. You know when a man marries, he likes to have a little something to say about it himself." "Exactly, and I meant you should have your choice; and if you   274        LOVE ON THE WING. wasn't satisfied here, wall, go off and marry; I'd be satisfied with any- thing'if yu was." "1hat is just what I've been doing. I have secured this young lady, thinking it the best chance in town, and with her I'm satisfied." "You don't expect to bring her here?" "Not unless she desires it." "Desires it! Zounds! you couldn't any more get her here than you could bring down the stars from the sky." "Wall, what if I couldn't. I could live somewhere else, I suppose, for there is room enough in the world yet." "Yes, but that wouldn't benefit me any, to have you marry and live somewhere else." "I didn't suppose it would; but as she wouldn't live here, we would be entitled to a place, like all the rest of the families of the world. When a man finds he can't do one thing, he can turn and do the next best." "Certainly. But what is the inducement? I thought I offered you so good a chance that you would conclude to accept, and remain here." "I'm willing to remain here if she is; if not, then I must go where she prefers to stay. That's the way husbands do, ain't it?" "I'don't know, for I never was one, so I can't tell. I guess they con- sult together some, and do what they both think best." "The sum and substance of it all amounts to this: I'm engaged to marry a lady who will object to coming here, for reasons well known to all; and, as we can't live here, we must live where we can, and this does not seem to meet with your wishes; and now the question arises, What is going to be done about it? Did you ever do anything others didn't like?" "Yes, frequently." Well, what did you do when they objected?" "Why, I did it, and left them to their objections." "That is just what I propose to do in this case." "Did it ever occur to you that possibly there might be objections raised, - I mean so high, that you couldn't get over them?" "I never saw any such, neither has my imagination ever conceived of such. Sir, it's impossible for such to be raised, providing only that she, who is behind the objections, is willing." "There's where's the rub; she won't be willing." "Then there is no need of further talk; for if she's not willing to marry me, - why, - I shall marry somebody else. All I can    EMPTY THREATS.            275 say about it is, I shall be sorry to hear such a decision from her; but from it there is no appeal." "That is the decision you will hear." "Have you heard her say it?" "No; but I soon will."                  i "You don't mean to say you are going to prevent the consummat; of these nuptials." "In so many words, I do." "You dare not." "Why?" "Your neck wouldn't be safe two hours." "Who would harm it?" "Myself." "The law would hang you." "Not for that offence it wouldn't." "It hangs for murder." "Ay, but not for justifiable murder; and this would be of tnat kind." "You couldn't make a jury believe it." "It has been done." "Name one." "Didn't President Jackson kill his foe?" "In a duel." "Yes." "Then you'll give me an equal chance for my life?". "Certainly; I wouldn't take it in cold blood. 'Let us give this mur- derous talk'up, and go to bed, and see if sleep and comfort can be ex- tracted from this bad news. I'll risk you troubling her; you can't be so mean a man; others have done less unworthy things and have died for it; have a care for yourself, and not seek to harm one who never did harm to you. I, who have stood by you these long, weary years, between your traducers and yourself, plead this, that I may marry her whom I love, and who in turn loves me. From one friend of another this is asked; now see if a friend's prayer will be unheeded, and passed by in scorn. I have pleaded, I have supplicated and in- terceded with you for thin lady but remember, if this doth fall through, you are, the one whom I shall blame, and for it you and I will yet be even. One good turn deserves another: so does a mean one. I have noq deserved this at Your hands, nor shall I forgive it; for the love I entertain for this lady is no trivial passion, to be raised in a moment, an4 dispelled by a gust of wind, I have loved her long and well, and it   276        LOVE ON THE WING. will be in sighs and tears that I give her up. Consider her, consider me, consider yourself, consider all, before you do it; for, by this single act, you may do all more harm than you are doing me. I may, I shall, sur- vive it, and the injury you do will fall on other heads than 'mine. You pull down the building to injure me, while I .escape undamaged, and all the rest, whom you think you are serving, are crushed beneath its ruins. You will do well to reconsider this again, and if the thing you have here that you call woman, doth prompt you to do this, say to her, ' We damage ourselves more than him,' and consequently we'd better let them go. Let them go and be happy, as it is a boon you never will enjoy; therefore, do not deny to them what you, yourselves, can never have; for happiness never grows on such a tree, polluted, as it is, at the root, with crime, and sin, and death." CHAPTER XLI. WILL AND RICHARD. -WILL AND BRIDGET. HE rose, and retired, not saying another word. He had but just left the room, when the thing he had called woman, rushed down stairs in partial dishabille, all in a rage; for she had been listening at the stove-pipe to all the conversation of the evening; and when Richard had finished his last speech, she crept down noiselessly to the foot of the stairs, not knowing whether she had better step in and throttle him, or wait until he had finished: the latter being the least objection- able, prevailed. When Richard was sufficiently beyond the reach of her voice,'she asked,- "Well, if you ain't a smart one, to sit there and stand that! A man of any honor would resent such an insult on the spot, by kicking him out of the house. I was a good notion to come in myself and pull his  al  hair out, an' if I thought you was goin' to sit there like a ninny, I would. I wish I was a man, O, how I would give it to such feuls," she said, while from her eyes there blazed a fire more intense and piercing than her words conveyed; and she iinterlarded the whole with words profane, as well as vulgar and indecent. "O, wall, you know this is our only salvation, and if we get him at all, we must use the mildest means, pr he'll bolt from us entirely, and  leave us in the lurch," he sweetly replied, aioppanied by a smile and a knowing bow. ".    BRIDGET RAVES.           2" "I don't care if he does; an' I can git somebody else if he does, so you needn't be afraid of that, but pitch right in, and take it out of his hide. I don't believe in bein' 'posed upon," she said, frowning as dark as midnight. "Wall, you see it just in this wise,"- and he pointed with his finger into the palm of the other hand,- "that no one else will answer our terms; and if we can get him, it will be a good start for you, and it will help me; so don't let's give up the game yet," he said, bowing sidewise. "You needn't think I'm goin' to put up with such insults as that from him, if we never get him. 'That thing you call woman!' I won- der if he thinks I hain't as good as any woman! It's cause I'm Irish, 1 suppose; but I'll let him know the Irish is as good as he is, the mean, good-for-nothing! O, how I would like to scratch out his eyes, and pull out his amber curls, as they call them!" she said, in unabated anger, which, like night, was always darkest just before light and reason dawn. "O, we musn't do anything violent, even if we lose the case; for that, you know, would make him worse, and more untractable. We must coax, and put up with these whims, for a while, anyway, that is, till we get him, and then you can use him just as you are a mind to, and. he won't say boo to it; for it won't do him any good if he does," he said, blandly. "Wall, I wouldn't care, if I could only pay him off for some of his insults as he goes along, for I shall have such a storehouse full of them, that I'll forget half of 'em," she said, more pleasant than before, at the same time she closed her mouth, and gazed a long, vacant, impudent look at him, making her face look like that of a monkey's, and her manners those of a fool; but he, instead of returning it with a look of disgust, smiled lovingly, as much as to say she was right, and Richard was a mean scamp. These indications of wrath didn't long predomi- nate over his reason, but departed as they came, caused by some out- ward influence, or without it. "You see, marriages that are brought about in this way are always more difficult than a mere love match; for in that case the lovers are more anxious than their friends, and are impatient and angry at any de- lay not caused by themselves. Knowing this, then, we must put up with what will necessarily happen, either to defer or postpone, appearing, however, not to care anything about it; and in this way we will out- wind him, and this course will, in the long run, get the start of most anybody. I nust give him credit for having the longest wind of any- body I ever came across, for I. certainly thought we would bring it 24   ;i'r I    278        LOVE ON THE WING. around before this time, but he seems as indifferent about it as ever. I wouldn't have to make this offer to many before I would have appli- cations by the score, and you would be overrun with suitors," he said, in his usual bland manner, while his mouth twitched as he observed the effect of his flattering words. O, wall, if Im good enough for him, I'm good enough for you," she said, rising and advancing towards him, seated herself upon his lap. "Now, say, you might as well let him go, and merry me yourself. I'll make you as good a wife as you can get; and yqu needn't think I'm goin' to stay here, and be talked about by everybody, for I've got now the meanest name in town, and it will be growing worse and worse every day. Come, now, what do you say; will you merry me or not? I won't stay here another day if you don't say you'll merry the," she said, stroking his chin, and pinching his cheek, while he, blushing scar- let, received it under protest, and tried to push her off. "Wall, I haven't the time myself; but you see I can spare you a month or so, and it won't make any difference with my business, where- as, if I should go off, something would have to be neglected, and it would, perhaps, cost more than the good I would gain by it, you see," he smiled, and bowed, but she didn't see anything worth mentioning in his bland, and apparently sincere words.  "Well, you needn't let him merry her anyway, till we see how it's goin' to work. What do you think he'd do to you if you should?" she asked, as a troubled expression passed over her face, for his words sounded ominously in her ears, as if they boded mischief. "O,1 guess he won't do anything much; but he would scare a fellow if he could, though I hardly think he'd go any further. There is dan- ger in some cases of this kind, but from him I guess there is none. It is at best a very objectionable business, and one which, should any one else know, would not reflect very much credit upon me; but I'm thank- ful no one will ever know anything of it; as ,I wouldn't be taunted with it for anything. If I really wanted her, it would be different, and in one sense excusable; but in this case it would look rather objectionable, as no one would enterinto our plans with the same zest as we do, conse- quently the same excusable motives will not present themselves; but, on the contrary, they will look on the opposite side, and not seeing anything to mollify the case, will condemn accordingly. I expected to have a brush with Charlie Spencer, he was such a wilful, imperious, headstrong fellow; but it seems he had to enlist and get killed. Poor boy! I'm sorry now I did anything of the kind, and perhaps I will be more sorry if I meddle with this young man's love. I don't know as    BRIDGET GIVES A LESSON.          279 he'll do anything violent, but there are other ways a man of his capa- city can resort to, without breaking either a law, or forfeiting the con- fidence of a friend. We ought to fear such more than a mere animal, for the latter we can meet boldly, face to face; but the former, though expected, is stealthy and unseen, and we know not which way to turn to repel our foe, nor what weapons to have in readiness," he said, slowly, bowing sidewise at every important word, and smiling benignly. He was sick of holding his quondam ward, and straightening out, allowed her to slide down upon the floor, where she sat, apparently as contented as before. "Wall, I want you to break it up anyway, for I hain't ready to have him merry yet. I'll risk him, he won't do nothing, I don't believe, ant if he does it won't hurt you any. You can go down there just once, an' she'll think you are comin' again; so when he goes down he'll have a different reception from what he has been in the habit of receivin' I guess, an' if he don't, why you can go down again, that's all. It won't hurt you any, nor him, nor her, so go ahead to-morry night. You needn't stay long, nor you needn't kiss her, neither. Just tell her you thought you would come down and see her again, an' make up for the past. You may hope she hain't laid anythin' up again you, an' if she has, to take it right off. Will-you go?" she asked, looking up, and smiling as sweetly as if she had been an angel, who never let fall an objectionable word from her ruby lips. "Yes, I guess I'd better go, and run the risk; but remember, if evil comes from it you must take your share of it, and not leave it all on my shoulders. There is nothing I hate so much as these continued love affairs, and I shall be glad if it is ever settled satisfactorily to all the parties. For my part I shall be satisfied with anything, if the rest are only pleased. But you must promise me if I do this, that you will marry him the first, opportunity that occurs, will you?" he asked, bending upon her a lovely smile, which passion had deepened into a fiery glow. "Why, how can I tell whether I will or not? Do you'suppose I'm goin' to ask him?I wouldn't ask the best man livin', now I tell you. If he wants me, an' proposes, why, I'll say it's a bargain, that's all. I hain't goin' to tell him I want him, nor any other feller, now I tell you; an' you needn't think I am, neither, for I ain't. I'd be in nice busi- ness, wouldn't I, askin' him, or makin' him think I wanted him?No I I tell you I hain't so hard up for a man as that, an' I wouldn't do it if there wasn't another man livin'," she said, frowning, while the mouth closed fast like a clam, and she looked for a recognition of the prepos-   I io280           LOVE ON THE WING, terous claims she had set up. The look was the same she always gives, whether in the house or on the street, - an impudent leer, as if inquir- ing the opinions of others, regarding her personal appearance, as well as her moral qualities, which, she thought, were as good as those of anybody; while those whom she thus consulted would, if they had spoken the conviction of their minds, have said, "You are a veritable fool, a consummate knave, and an unpardonable sinner." i I don't. mean you to do anything of the kind. All I want of you is to be receptive, and not utterly reject every hint ind advance he may make. If he says anything abbut marriage, why, talk marriage, and keep multiplying words when you see the conversation is flagging, and don't let his interest in the subject lessen from lack of attention. If I were a woman, I believe I could get any fellow I wanted; though it ain't best with some to be too fast; yet with others, those who are bash- ful and afraid to speak, you can't be too fast, especially after they have initiated the subject by starting the ball a-rolling," he said slowly, and with some emphasis. "Wall, if you think I'm goin' to be run on the same as you've been to-night, you're much mistaken, for I hain't of that kind to let a fel- low like him impose on me, now I tell you," she said, bowing, as he had done, and closed the clam-shell, and looked for another flattering tribute to her many merits. He looked down upon her with eyes beam- ing with love, and said, - "Wall, he won't do anything of the kind, if you don't first provoke him. So it will be all your own fault if you don't finally get him. If you could once get the love, such as he would be willing to give some one, you might say or do anything you;please, and he wouldn't lisp a word in retaliation; but as it is, you see, you want to yield a little to him, until you get his love, and then you can do as you are a mind to," he said, coaxingly. "Yield! is it? I'd like to see the feller I'd yield to. No, I won't do it. I'll let him know plainly what I am, an' then if he's a mind to take' me, all right; but he shan't have it to say that I deceived him. As bad as I am, I couldn't do that, fur I think that is the meanest thing anybody can do; an' if any one fooled me in that way I'd have his life, so I would," she said, her mouth closing as before. "You don't think it's bad in me to go down there and make Sarah think I'm going to marry right straight away, when I haven't any such intention, while with you it's perfectly awful when you really have marriagein view, and anxious to have it brought about. All you want to do is to be conciliatory, mild, and gentle, and, the case is won; and I      'p   WrLLIAM  ANXIOUS ABOUT RICHARD.       281 if not, there is no use of my going down and entangling myself further in this affair, when you will not try to secure the fruits of our, enter- prise," he said, petulantly. "I will try all I can without being run upon. I won't take that from anybody. If he'll be good to me,'I'll be good to him fur a while, but not long, fur I owe him a blowing, an' I'm goin' to give it to him the furst chance I get," she said. "I'd put off that until after I had him fast, and then there will be time enough to pay off the old score, and you have a whole life to do it in, and that too without endangering present prospects. You want to have an eye always on these, and keep them well in view, or else you'll get stranded on some reef or another, so far out from shore that you'll never get to land again. Well, come, you might as well clear out and go to bed. See, it's about eleven o'clock! 'To-morrow even- ing I'll go down there, and see what she says; and if I can make her defer, it for a while, I will," he said, rising and, going to the door, looked out to see if any one was lurking around eavesdropping; but thinking everything satisfactory, he returned to finid 'her sitting there still. "Come, you'll take cold if you sit there long," he said, in a voice of more tenderness than authority. "Wall, I 'must say, you order me around as if I was a mere nobody; but I'll give you to understand that I hain't," she said, rising, and, run- ning towards him, would have pushed him down, but for the timely. intervention of the wall against which he came with such force as to stagger him before he recovered himself. She followed up her success by grappling with him, and attempted to throw him down, which, of course, he resisted by physical exertions'as well as whispering to her 'to " be still. Look out there, somebody will be coming in, and catch us wrestling, which, you know, wouldn't be a pretty report to go around." To which she said "she didn't care anything about their reports. She was goin' to have some fun anyway." ' Thus they struggled, until out of breath she gave up, and proceeded up stairs to her room, where sleep amply repaid her for the exertion she had undergone. William mused long on the occurrences of the evening, which had been, to say the least, eventful; and the decision to which they had arrived troubled' him not a little. Those words of Richard's still rang in his ears like a death-knell; and his already harassed mind vainly sought to find refuge in the hope that he would marry agreeably to his wishes, not only to be better able to serve him, but also to shield him from the odious iimputation of living in disregard of all laws. With these' reflections, and their consequences crowding rapidly upon his 24*    Ai   282        LOVE ON THE WING. mind, ne prepared himself for slumber, to see, from Richard's remark, "what comfort could be extracted from this bad news." Both William and Richard slept little that night, and little comfort either found. One was trying to persuade himself " that as he had loved the same lady, and perhaps as tenderly and devotedly as he, it would be no worse for Richard to give her up than it was for him. William had survived it, and had laid up no ill will againstany one; and so he might, as undoubtedly he would, for he couldn't fail to dis- cover the motives which prompted; and as they were perfectly interested he could not fail to overlook everything that would tend to bring about so desirable a result as the one he had proposed to Richard; and, as he had promised to compensate Richard for any loss he might incur in complying with his wishes, he thought that that would be a check to the vindictive impulse of Richard's anger, when he found himself thus cut off from all hope of. a realization of this his early and impassioned dream. He knew Richard loved her with all the passion of his young and ardent nature, and she, in return, loved him; for it was impossible that the love which Richard bestowed could fail to beget a love in re- turn, even in natures less susceptible of those tender emotions which, at her age, throb in the bosoms of either sex, and that it would be in sighs and tears that he gave her up. He had protested fervently for her, and no one, not wholly lost to every pure and holy sentiment, could fail to recognize in that look of supplication, and in the tones of his prayerful voice, a sincere wish to be permitted to take to his bosom this his devoted love. Could he blind his eyes to that look through the remaining years of his life? or hush the ill-boding sounds of that voice, which now, and would forever, ring in his ears? and finally, could he steel his conscience against the self-reproving voice within, which rose up in rebellion against the determination his selfish interest had commanded him to do?And what would he do in retaliation for so grave an offence against him? Alas! time alone could tell. Would it do to arm the fates against him, so that he, at the expiration of each revolving year, could not look with pleasure back and see that no hid- den hand had stolen a joy or interposed an obstacle to his fiture prog- ress and prosperity, aside from those natural hinderances which con- tinually beset the path of every virtuous man. He didn't wish to array against him the forces of nature and the ill will of a justly-enraged fellow, whom he would wrong by this simple act, past all hope of forgiveness. He lnew this, and he felt the justice of his sentence; but what could he do? The people were circulating scandalous reports about him, and the manner in which he was living, which was heaping   RICHARD'S REFLECTIONS.         283 not only disgrace upon him, but also upon his sister and her children and the memory of his deceased parents, whom he still revered as be- ing models of purity, innocence, and love. Them he should disgrace, and these dishonor, if he-persisted in the Course he was already pur- suing." Thus he reasoned through the long and silent hours of that long and dreary night. But what were the reflections of Richard, as he tossed upon a restless pillow that same eventful night?We shall see. What had he to dread? Was not the future before himP And whom had he wronged, that he should be thus chastened? Ha! not one. Through the long vista of a cold and cloudy past, he could  look, and not see one face of sorrow turned towards him; and might he not look forward through years to come with the same confidence and hope that not a living soul should live in dread or in sorrow for him? Let what evil might befall him, he would remember nothing against any man; for such are the clouds of life which naturally drift across our horizon, to leave nothing but sunshine behind; and the one is more bright, as the other is more dark and dreary, than justice would have meted out to him.- He could look back with a calm and serene con- science, the same as in future years he wished to look back upon his present days, and, not regretfully, with the thought that some one had lived whom he had purposely and designedly wronged, that he, himself, might be advanced or protected in the troubled affairs of the world. "No, not one," he would let others do as they wished, while he would patiently suffer the effects of circumstances he could not control. He would abide in hope, and await a better time coming, in the belief that as clouds and darkness had heretofore overshadowed him he would wait and see if the future had nothing more bright in store for him; and if not, he would carve himself out a happiness even from the darkest clouds, and 'find consolation in the thought that had he resorted to more stringent measures, he might have been more blessed and fortu- nate.   284        LOVE ON THE WING. CHAPTER XLII. APOSTROPHE: AND WILL AND SARAH. O  UR two brave heroes. rose early, though unrefreshed, one to plot and plan for his own aggrandizement, and the other to suffer the effects of it. One had patronage and wealth, while the other was un- influential and poor. One was satiated with indolence and luxury, while the other was borne down with the toil and hardship of a labo- rious life. One had no need of more wealth, for the interest of what he had placed him far above the reach of want, while the other must labor for the necessaries of life. One was independent, while the other was dependent. How unequal was the strife: for one had all the weapons of war, while the other had nothing but his bare hands, with neither friends nor allies to aid him; yet the sympathy of all cannot fail of being enlisted on the side of him who has the most need of it, and who bears, uncomplainingly, the unmerciful decrees of a fate he could neither appease nor restrain. But why is this? Should the strong devour the weak? Are not tne feudal days of tyranny and oppression gone? But what kind of tyr- anny is this, that is fostered in the land of liberty, truth, and love? Must the poor, to escape, seek homes in the west, thus cutting off all the dear associations of youth? or is this to go on as long as the world stands, the reasoning, and intellectual portion doing and acting the same as the animals of the forests, the birds of the air, the serpents of the jungle, and the fishes of the sea. We look and see the lion crouching to spring upon his prey, that he may feed his young and himself upon the yet still bleeding and quiver- ing flesh of his victim. We see the deer ambling along in innocent mirth, all unconscious of a hidden foe, when out springs the panther upon his unsuspecting victim, nor stops at the cry of pain, or the plead- ing look of those eyes which never looked upon a creeping thing with malice aforethought. And so it is with all the four-footed beasts of the earth, one lives but as the prey of the other. One as the de- stroyer, the other as the victim. We see the hawk circling high in the heavens, watching with pier- cing eye the feeble birdlings that flutter by. his side, aware of danger, yet constantly in it. We see him dash, in headlong fury, upon the in- nocent bird; a struggle, a screech of pain, and all is over, and the little    THE STRONG AND THE WEAK.          285 bird is food for him who proved the strongest. The eagle, too, soars over the smooth, silvery lake, reflecting back the peaceful images of other birds, and the rich, golden harvests of a thousand farms, of peace- ful homes, and smiling groves; yet onward and .along, now down to the rippling wave, he descends, then upward, as a stronger foeman ap- pears, with gun in hand, to bring down the proudest bird of the air. There. now he sees a circling wave let rise in the glittering sun, and down he goes with scoop, as sudden and as quick as the lightning's flash, and burying his talons deep in the fish's back, rises with difficulty from his perilous position, to his home of safety and of rest. The robin, trilling his morning song of praise, perched upon the topmost bough of some stately, elm, until the sun slants his rays along the meadow and the sparkling brooklet, when it dashes down upon the worm on the sod, then to its joyful, yet hungry young, it flies, bearing in its beak the morning meal, glad that it was no longer delayed. 'The swal- low chases the butterfy across the meadow heath, and capturing him, returns joyful to its hungry young. We see them dash upward, now downward, always swooping with an easy grace, as their victims dodge to and fro to avoid their ravenous bills. The serpent coils himself unseen, amid the drooping foliage of the forests, and all unconscious the deer or the buffalo walks into its deadly embrace, to struggle and cry, moaning his untimely end. We hear a splash among the reeds by the river's bank: it is but the presence of the destroying foe and his victim, struggling there for mastery or for death! Let the strong rejoice in his strength, and the feeble moan for his weakness. Let the heart be glad for his triumph, and the weak fly away in dismay! In\ the presence of the great and the mighty, the powerful and the strong, the puny little things of earth have no chance,; for snails feed the alligator, and the alligator nourisheth his strength for stronger victims. We look down into the clear depths of the lake, and see the pickerel dash upon his prey, and devour the living flesh, still trembling in his gills. The pike and the perch sport in the pellucid waves, the former to live, and the latter to die. Thus it is the world over, and thus it has been, and thus it will be, till time shall be no more, and earth be swal- lowed up in victory. We hear the busy hum of industry, the gladdening huzzas of joyful youth, as onward they go to their allotted toil, little dreaming of the destiny awaiting them. We see the curling smoke ascending in spiral colimns from a thousand chimneys, carrying with it upward in its course the prayers of parents, and the unuttered words of hope from   ! t286              LOVE ON THE WING. the prattling tongues of youth, to melt and die away in the air, or be of no avail in the greedy avarice of a stronger fellow. We know not the crime and sin concealed beneath those roof-tops, and hidden from the eye of heaven, and the vengea cle of an enraged God; an I He marks with impartial justice, with his finger upon the book of life, the good deeds of his children, who, struggling on through the buffeting waves of life, their reason spurred on by hope, and their love by faith iu Him, until at last they sink, exhausted and faint, at th efeot of the Lamb, amply repaid for all their toil. We see the azure vault of heaven flecked with flying clouds, as hither and thither they hasten, as squadrons upon squadrons mar- shalling for a fight. Soon the heavens are overcast by dark and lower- ing clouds. The lightning flashes, and heaven's artillery thunders forth the vengeance of His wrath. The tall oak which nobly withstood the blasts of centuries, is riven into a thousand fragments, and the proud forests bow down their stately heads in meek submission to a stronger will. The rain descends in blinding torrents, flooding the fields, and levelling the harvests of the husbandman, who labored long and faith- fully for his bread; and because God had promised him seed time and harvest, he had faith to believe that he would yet reap his fruits. The fruitage of countless groves of quince, pear, peach, plum, orange, date, and citron are laid low in the deluging flood, and the husbandman weeps, upon the devastation of but a few moments, tears of bitter regret that the avenging breath of his Maker should thus lay low his golden fruits. In a few moments all is still, and the sun looks out from beneath a dripping curtain, and smiles upon the scene. The drops trembling upon a gentle twig reflect back the colors of the spanning bow, and all nature looks serene and lovely, even upon the devastating scene. Look! The clouds are scattering and hastening before the breath of Boreas, whose echoing notes sound far and near the disbandment of Heaven's mighty, army. See! By yon hill-top the clouds blend the purple with the gold, the azure screen beyond permitting the enchant- ing colors to fade -into nothingness, leaving the calm, clear vault of heaven starless and alone! In our admiration of the beauties and glories of God and creation, let us, bow down in meek humbleness of spirit, that our hearts may reflect both the shadow and the light. Let us look, and wonder, and admire: butlet us remember, and with thank- ful hearts return our praises to Him, the Author of both good and evil, for evil lurks continually in the footsteps of the good. Let us comfort our sorrow in the hope of- future happiness, that our joy may be chastened, in view of the heavenly mansion.   WILLIAM  RENEWS HS VOWS.        287 With a sad and desponding spirit Richard discharged the duties of the day, and at night again sought his pillow, to see if he couldn't sleep off the incubus which weighed so oppressively upon his spirit. He was tired and sleepy, and Morpheus came to his rescue; and encircled him in arms of peaceful, refreshing slumber. He was unconscious of the passing hours, and they fled by on eagle's wings, leaving no mark or trace behind. The moon looked down upon the snow-clad earth, while the stars glittered and sparkled in the frosty air; and the delicate crys.\ tals of ice, and snow, and frost reflected back in sparkling gems the starry vault. Who knew all this that night It was William. Was he on an errand of mercy, or of love, or of revenge? Echo answers! A bleeding heart, crying out in anguish, answers that it was revenge. Here was a heart delicately knit round, with the tendrils of a loved and loving being, whose heart and soul were all wrapped up in his inner being, shielding from harm her, the dearest object of his life; and yet by one fell stroke of the destroyer's hand that life and heart were severed, the former to go plodding on through life's- dreary pathway, the latter lay quivering in the dust. Here is a life blasted in its bud, and a hope forever crushed, - and for what?To satiate the insatiable anger of an enraged foe, and to fill to the brim the bowl of wickedness and of forbidden love. That's what it was for. But we will see on whom falls the weight of the crash - the destroyer, or his suffering vic- tim! Wait! In impatience we listen, and no sound we hear. But wait a little longer, and a sepulchral sound will be heard, perhaps from the tomb of the dead, crying vengeance! Vengeance is mine! and ven- geance I'll have! The unhushed voices of the dead stili speak against this glaring deed of violence and crime, which, we supposed, was stilled forever in death. Nearly six years had rolled around since William had sat in that room, and plighted his vows to wed, at no very distant day, she around whom so many fond hopes have clustered, but now, alas! are withered and destroyed. "  He had come," he said, " to renew his engagements, and makegood his long-neglected words. You may discredit me, but my words are trtue." "Discredit you? No," she cried, "you are always welcome here, with thrice more joy than if you had come before. Better late than never, though now is the most opportune moment you could return," she replied, u bile she suffered him gently to fold her to his bosom. She had many times promised to be the wife of another, while he who thus embraced her, she might have known, would never be her husband; but love with her, as it is with everybody else, is blind, and is only gov-   2Q88       LOVE ON THE WING. erned by expediency, or with him, by some inducement. Neither did I J '  he feel a twinge of remorse while occupying a position which rightly belonged to another, and where he, himself, had no business. Nor did she care for the loving heart which was breaking, and in its agony had H } i  rocked itself to sleep. Their thoughts were all of the present, the one in fear and the other in hope. One thought he was doing a commend- able thing in cutting off from a loving heart the object of its devo- tion; while the other cared not who suffered, or what heart bled, if she could only realize the ambitious hopes of youthful dreams. Thus time wore on, both hypocritical in their protestations of love and confidence, both regardless of all the consequences which that evening's visit would eventually entail; and while both knew, or be- lieved,that Richard was not blind to the influences which were being brought to bear against him, one shuddered as his name and words in- voluntarily rose in his mind, while the other was drinking too deep from the cup of pleasure to taste the dregs she was unconsciously ,sip- ping. By neither was the name of Richard mentioned, though one thought of him in dread, and the other, if at all, in contempt. "Wall," said William, in a complaisant tone, as he leaned back in his chair, and coolly surveyed the room, with its glaring light, its glow- ing fire, and its gorgeous appointments, " you are pleasantly situated here, and no one could ask to be better off." Yes, it is very pleasant indeed, if one's ambition extends no fur- ther," she replied, with an arch smile. "That ambition were vain and useless which extends beyond this; for what more can heart or soul desire than what is here in ample pro- fusion?" he asked, unconsciously betraying his own anomalous posi- tion. "O, it's good enough for a while; but I hardly think it would satisfy the ambition of any one forever," she replied, smiling pleasantly. "O, I don't know. That would depend entirely on how ambitious a person was, for if it extends to thrones and empires, nothing short of that will satisfy; or if the ambition is for fame, nothing short of a chaplet wreath will still the pulsations of an unquiet soul," he said, rather more learnedly than was customary for him. Without going so far as either of these exalted stations, a person may have ambition, and still be attainable, and still be unhappy outside of the attainment," she replied. "I never could see, for my part, what could possess anybody to wish beyond their own actual necessities. Now, all we can get in this world are our board and clothes. However much more we may have, these are all we can actually makevuse of," he said, ironically.   WILLTAM'S LOST AMBITION.         289 "Would you be content with these?" Could I be assured of them for life, yes; would I be in need when sickness and death arrive, no. But could I have enough to get com- fortably through the world, and not be a burden upon any, it would be all I could wish and desire," he said, bending upon her an ambiguous smile, "Your language is very different from that you used years ago. Then you wanted to be worth a million, and now you are contented with far iess," she said, trying to appear happy. "I was young then," he said, regretfully. "Yes, and like myself, ambitious," she returned. "I was ambitious of more wealth, that I might liue at my ease and leisure. We have made more during this war, than all together during the half a century previous," he said, wishing to elude or turn the sub- ject, which he might have foreseen would lead him to conclusions he would rather avoid. I ' Was you ambitious of nothing more than wealth?" she asked, searching his countenance for an answer she knew would not deceive her. But in this she was deceived; for though the book was open be- 'fore her, yet not a letter was printed upon the page, and not a sign of the passionless soul could she detects neither in his words nor in his looks, and she began to think she was hasty in extending to him the cordial welcome he received on his first arrival. It was too late now, and she had only one resource, and that was to watch and wait, as she always had done, the development of circumstances she and her friends had endeavored to control. Could she call back the words she had first uttered, and commence again, she would receive his attentions in a manner worthy their sincerity; but no, they were gone, and she had again been outwitted by one whom, of all others, she most dreaded. We must not forget his answer. "I was ambitious of nothing more, that I know of," he said, as coolly as if transacting any ordinary business, and without deigning more th.:1 a casual glance at her anxious face. "Take care! Think! Think again, and see if there was nothing more in your thoughts but the desire of wealth," she said, in a tone of mixed tenderness and reproof. "O, that to which you allude was nothing more than a circumstance always attending the step of youth, and whjch, though necessary in some cases, is not for the acquisition of wealth," he said, uneasily, as he glanced towards the door; wishing he could vanish through it, and disappear beyond the influence of that supplicating look, under which   290          LOVE ON THE WING he winced. He would have given thousands if he was at that moment home in his bed, where Richard was, enjoying, in undisturbed repose, the sleep of a guileless conscience. That which he was doing was re- pugnant to his better feelings, and he declared that if he had known the half of what it was to carry out what at first looked so easy he would not have attempted it; but important interests were at issue, and the quicker he got through the quicker he would get home; and so, gathering what courage he could from the lateness of the hour and his own exhausting faculties, he pushed on, hoping soon to weather out the storm, and land safely at Nestoria. "And do these ambitious designs attend no other footsteps than those of youth? I thought - I had hoped -perhaps -there is - no. That ambition, then, is now quite dead?" she asked, at last, not know- ing hardly how to present it. "O, no; yet it is not so much ambition as a settled wish. In youth such whims are flighty and unsteady, while the older a person gets the more confirmed in his resolution he becomes," he said, not aware that the words could be construed both ways. "So you have decided never to matry, have you?" she asked, look- ing anxiously, mixed with a pleading love. "O,no! O, no! I didn't say that; but I did say, the more he becomes confirmed in his boyish whims," he replied, looking eagerly, and contradicting impatiently the conclusions at which she arrived. "I should think you might say what you intended doing, so as not to leave me longer in suspense; for it ain't very pleasant waiting here, thinking every day you'll come down and see me, still you never come," she said, with more tenderness than she had yet employed. "Wall, so I will; but I only wanted to pave the way this time, and then in a day or two I would unfold all my plans of the future for your inspection, hoping, of course, they would meet with your approbation," he said, bluntly, and in an apparent sincere manner. "Let me hear them now, for they will gratify my curiosity very much, and relieve many of the painful forebodings I have of late en- tertained in regard to your ambiguous conduct; and I think I am justly entitled to this explanation, for I hope you have not yet for- gotten the engagement which you contracted with me some years ago?" she asked, looking him steadily in the eye, while a frown gathered upon her brow. "No, I haven't forgotten it. Let me see. It was right in this room, and seated pretty near where we are now. Yes, I remember. Such recollections, you know, do not so easily fade as others," he said, sweetly.   SARAH MAKES AN EARNEST APPEAL.         291 ".But this is not particularizing, as I can see. Come, now, own up to the truth. Do you intend to marry or not? That's the question and it's my privilege to enforce an answer, even at the stern mandate of justice; but i'll neverresort to such an extremity if you never marry, for if I can't rely upon the good intentions of a man in this respect, what consolation could I otherwise get? None, absolutely none; for what consideration would be sufficient to make amends for the past? Is the love of a devoted heart to be measured by the amount of money that may be extorted from the grasp of a sordid miser? No, I scorn the idea. It is a duty you owe to me, and it is a dutyyou owe to your- self, and it is a duty you owe to society, to meet me half way, and re- new the old pledges of affection which we exchanged in our youth. You needn't look around at the door, for I don't mean to let you go until I have exacted a promise that you will fulfil the engagement of other years. Stop! No, you shan't go. Justice, right, honor, love, crushed hopes, and a bleeding heart, all forbid. How can you look so coldly upon me - I, whom you once vowed to love and protect through life? Is this the way you requite my love? - I, who have waited thus pa- tiently these long and weary years, for you to return to me, to the plighted love of my youth. Do I merit it?What have I done? Say  say one word, that you love me still, and I'll let you go. Not without that word: no, never! 'Tis mine! 'tis all I ask, and perhaps not another opportunity will be presented; for you, regardless of me, and the love you once entertained for me, will forget this evening, will blot out ofyour recollection this scene, a scene in which a rejected love pleads with itself for a renewal, or a confirmation of that which'has so long remained a dead letter upon the tablet of my heart. Do you speak? Do I hear the word, that you love me still? Say it, or never from this room will you go. I'm in earnest. My life is at stake, and BO is yours, if this doth pass unregarded. To think a woman should thus plead with the hard and stony heart of a man; a heart which had been hers but for. the intervention of one lost to all the nobler impulses of life; one to whom, I expect, if justice on earth can be meted out through other channels than a court of justice, will receive her reward  "Woman, woman! thou art mad; for I'll th I you truly that I never from the first designed it. I loved you, and do still, with till the ardor of chivalry, and all the romance of fiction. But be patient; do wait. It won't always be so then we will marry,. and you and I be halpy again; and we will be happier far than if the union had been con- summated at once, and we, through these years, had lived together. }   1    292        LOVE ON THE WING. Come, rise up nowr and dry those tears, even in the sunshine of my love. I didn't mean this; neither was it caused by me. I was sincere, and devoted, and true; and if a cruel circumstance had not prevented, you and I would now be living in wedded bliss. There, that's right. I knew I could make you smile; and don't let that cloud come down again to obscure the beauty of your face. I'll kiss you now, in token of reconciliation and the renewment of our love. There, now, let me go, and I promise to see, you before another week shall pass." He raised her gently in his arms, and kissed her pallid lips, and then she followed him to the door, where he kissed her again, and, bidding her good night, was soon lost in the distance. CHAPTER     XLIII. ISAAC, AND ELLEN, AND SARAH.--RICHARD AND HS "ETTER. WILLIAM longed to get out into the cold, still air, and he drew a sigh of relief when he found himself seated in his cutter, his lines in hand, and under way. He turned, and cast one look at the house from which he had just escaped, all dripping in perspiration. He never would be caught there again, any way; and he wouldn't have been this time but for the circumstances; yet no circumstance will ever again place him in such a position. One such scene as that is enough to last one a lifetime; and afterwards, if he escape unhurt, be deemed a man fully qualified to enter into any business of life. It is the most trying order.; through which a man can pass, and one too, which, though re- flecting no credit upon a man, must try his heart, and wrench it into every conceivable shape. He survived it, and lived some years after- wards; but whether in shame or glory, is the purpose of this story to tell. We'll see. The next morning there was a counsel held at Isaac's on the subject, and no one could tell what it was that brought William down. It couldn't be that the influence of public opinion, as expressed by Locker, Jones, and Adams, was just beginning to work. And if not this, what in the world could have caused it? No one could tell. They hadn't expected him; and not a word of late had been said to him, except what Isaac had said about the engagement of Richard; and that, cer-   CONSULTATION ABOUT WILLIAM.        293 tainly, couldn't make any difference with him: yet this must be the cause. "For you see," said Isaac, ," the last I said-anything to him about it was, that Richard was engaged to Sarah, and he thought, I suppose, he would come down and secure you for himself; because no one would think enough of a man to do that merely to prevent him marrying, and if he did, he would be hooted in the streets," he said. "No, it couldn't be that, certainly. His conscience was just begin- ning to smite him, and the admonitions of those philanthropists a year ago awakened him to a sense of his awful position," Mrs. Wood said, seconding the idea of her husband. Yes, it was that, of course, for nothing could force him against his will. But what did he say, Sarah?"Isaac asked "O, he said he loved me still, and always had, and but for the inter- vention of a circumstance we would now be married. I made him say this by my earnest protestations, otherwise he would have gone with- out saying anything on the subject. He tried to. evade it all the even- ing, but I wouldn't run that way, and thus outwitted him," she said, as if much pleased with her strategy. "You say you made him, eh?A declaration of love extorted in that way, I think, will avail but little: but make the most of it, and may success yet crown your efforts," Isaac said, exultingly. Yes, and he said he would come down before the week was out, and more fully reveal his intentions," she said, her eye beaming with gladness. "Good! I'm heartily glad of this. I thought he couldn't hang off against popular opinion very long. I'll set more after him. If I could only get Mr. Forbes, that'good old smiling-faced banker, to say a word, it would be a triumph, sure; but he is so afraid of losing William's patronage at the bank, that I don't believe I can get him to say any- thing. He is a man who minds his own business too, and will not readily criticise any man's manner of life. I don't know but I could get him by giving him enough, for every man has a price, which, if not too high, a man could be induced to assist in correcting the errors of those who rebel against the ordinances of society," he said, much more pleased than he had been of late. "Wall, now, we will see if we can keep him in the path; and Isaac, you must exercise your vocal organs in the cause of humanity, and Sarah - I haven't seen her look so well for a year as she does this morning. I believe if she were only married to William she would recuperate immensely," Ellen said, as she looked upon the glowing, 2 *   294    *    LOVP ON THE WING. happy face of her sister, which now was radiant with hopes of the future. ' You. needn't be alarmed but I'll keep him in tow; but you'll both find there will be something to do, or we may lose this game yet. All depends on good management and skilful manoeuvring. Handle well your cards, and don't get euchred again. What are you going to do with Richard, when he comes?"Isaac asked, with a little feeling for him, who, he knew, loved Sarah dearly. "O, he is easy enough managed. I shall be engaged, and his proud nature won't brook a second question. He won't come down till Suni day, and between this and then there will be plenty of time to arrange all the preliminaries of the strife. If he was my only trouble or hin- derance I wouldn't long complain," Sarah said. - "Wall, I wouldn't be uncivil with him, but inform him as mildly as possible that his attentions are no longer agreeable. That will hurt him enough without adding the sting of sarcasm, and do it, too, in a polite and genteel kind of way, and he'll think, perhaps, you are only fooling. This will relieve the draught of much that is bitter. But don't, on any account, let him see Sarah, for she might drive him to distrac- tion. We don't want any such scenes or tragedies connected with this, for we have succeeded in getting along so far without exciting much public comment; and let us, if possible, get clear through," Isaac said, icommiseratingly, who, it will be seen, was not entirely destitute of a tender feeling, but which was usually shrouded over and concealed by passion and conceit. "O, wall, I guess it won't kill him if he is snubbed a little, for I've suffered as much, probably, as anybody ever did, and I don't see as I'm any the worse for it; and it's no more than right that somebody should be made to feel what it is to have a love thrust back in scorn and contempt, as mine has been. I wish I had William in such a plight: wouldn't I give it to him, O, goodness! wouldn't I, though? But it's all the same if any of the sex receive the rebuked' she said, in a pleas- ant rage. "I hardly think it is the same; and I can hardly see why Richard should receive the punishment which William's delinquencies so justly merit. It is always a painful duty to say no; then how much more so is it to say that which we know can't fail to cause a bitter pang?" Ellen said, much more feelingly than her husband. The days rolled on the same as usual, not lessening the heavy bur- den of perplexing cares which each day's revolution carried with it. They were to some, days of happiness and peace, but not to Rfchard.   RICHARD IS DESPERATE.         295 He knew the crisis was approaching which would soon decide his fate with regard to Sarah. To meet it manfully was his resolve, and not manifest any concern; but in spite of this resolution his spirits would sink, and his ambition all give way to the saddening influence of his rejected suit. He sang and whistled apparently as merrily as ever, but they were only short snatches of song, the whole of which he did not know; but nothing he could do would banish her from his thoughts. He tried to persuade, himself that she wouldn't receive William's ad- vance, or believe him sincere in anything he said; but these consider. ations were all overruled by the weightier influence of money, which was all-powerful, not only there, but everywhere. He was foredoomed to a bitter disappointment; and he might say or resolve what and how he would do, he couldn't feel resigned, nor think that all things happen for the best. Thus the few days passed since his interview with Wil- liam and his visit to Sarah, and in fact all the remaining winter, in gloom and sadness. Hardly a smile beamed upon his face during all that time, and he felt that life was more a burden than a blessing. He knew there were other ladies as good and pretty as the one who was forsaking him ; but could he love one as much and as dearly as he loved her? This was a question which time only could answer. Once he resolved not to go; but then he thought she might afterwards say, You might have known that after he had slighted me for so many years, that I wouldn't believe a word he said." No; ha would go and hear the worst, and then would know exactly how to act, and what' to depend upon. Accordingly he spruced up one Sunday morning and resolved to see her, and hear om her own mouth his sentence. He had never heard such words rom her, and he wondered much whether she could speak them or not. If she loved him, as he loved her, she couldn't, no, not for worlds; for he would rather lose his right hand than cause her one half of that pain. Everything bothered him that morning; and the first was his razor, which didn't half cut, but after bleeding himself in a dozen places, he called himself shaved. The blood of his neck stained his collar, and dropped on the shiny bosom, which he had saved with so much care, to wear on this particular occasion, though in far different expectati)ns. His boots didn't shine, but the black from his fingers shone very bright on his bosom, where he unmindfully put them to adjust a stud which seemed a little out of place; but perhaps he wouldn't be asked to remove his overcoat, and, if not, his unsightly shirt-bosom wouldn't be seen, At last he started; and as he neared the house he tried to compose   296        LOVE ON THE WING. his countenance, so as to leave no sign of his anxiety and sorrow visible; but in spite of him a shade, he knew, was there. He looked up to the window, which looked from the room she occupied, and wondered if she saw him coming, and was prepared already with her answer. He walked up the step; they heard him coming, and he heard a flutter of garments, as the wearer fled hastily from the room. He stood before the door, and, shaking himself, to see if he was all alive, and if he was, to rouse all his faculties into active play. He put his hand tremblingly to the bell-knob, and giving it a hervous jerk, the bell rang, but the knob came off. He put his hand to his face, to rub away the confusion which he knew was mantling there, and to partially conceal it from the observation of her who should admit him. Ellen opened the door, and with a graceful, though formal bow, wel- comed him with a "good-morning, and it's pretty good sleighing," and other commonplace remarks, which Richard acknowledged with many bland words and sweet smiles, while he proceeded to divest him- self of his outer garments and overshoes, the same as he always had done, and which he thought was in perfect keeping with the prescribed rules of good breeding. Ellen, noticing this, hemmed, and appearing to be a little excited. Richard looked up and saw that something was coming, when she hemmed again, and said, with much difficulty, "You wish to see, I sup- pose - ahem,. though I'm sorry - ahem. Sarah - ahem - is rather indisposed -hem - the morning, being so - hem -chilly, and so much snow - hem - she hardly expected to see any one to-day - hem." Richard stopped and looked at her in blank astonishment, not know- ing, at first, what to say or what to do. At last he mustered courage to inquire what the language meant, and whether he should understand that his-" attentions were no longer agreeable," he said, as he carefully resumed ias coat and shoes. Ellen said, "if it would not be too painful for him, they would like very much to have it so understood; for circumstances always alter cases." Richard looked as if an arrow bad pierced his heart, and he leaned against the door for support, and in low, trembling words, murmured, "But what circumstance has altered this case?" "I am not at liberty to make domestic disclosures. Good by!" "Good by, madam; I hope to see you all again, though under far different auspices." He closed the door carefully, and without unneces- sary noise, and hastened back, nor stopped to take a last look of the   RICHARD'S LETTER TO SARAH.         297 house; nor, did he look in the direction of that ill-fated spot for weeks afterwards. He first thought he would go and counsel with his mother; but she would only laugh at him, and say he was a coward, or something worse. Finally, he resolved to nurse his indignation or sorrow, and draw what consolation he could from solitary musing. If he could only see her, even but for a moment, he could convince her of the continuance of his own passion, and the utter indifference of William. Should he go? No: he had been, and had been summarily dismissed, and to again pre- sume upon their forbearance would be but to expose himself to ridicule. What could be done? Nothing. Yes, he might write. She would excuse it in the anguish of his grief. She would hear patiently his last words, and perhaps remember them. It would relieve his wounded heart, and it would do her no hurt, and probably it might cause a reconcilement. The possibility of such a thing filled his soul with joy, and hastily drawing out his writing materials, he quickly dashed off these burning words:-- "SABBATH EVE, MDNIGHT,  "MY r)EAIR SARAH, -         NESTORIA, January 14, 1866.  "Or will you refuse me now this title? Do not, for you will hardly fathom the depth, and height, and breadth of my consuming sorrow. Since first I saw you, sitting oh a stool behind the stove in the corner, I have loved you; loved you with all the fervor of my heart. You will read these lines, won't you, Sarah? They are my last -O, no, Sarah! don't permit it! They are wrung fresh and bleeding from the heart of desperation, and no rest can I get till I have written them; and it is my only consolation that you will peruse to the end these truthful words. Shall I say that I hope you will relent, and change your de- cisioln? You can, and without injustice to yourself and to me. O, great happiness! If I could only influence you to think as I do, then how easy would be my victory. .But you won't; no you wouldn't relent, and retract what you have said, if your life and mine, and all the world besides, depended upon it. So obstinate and perverse is human nature. Then why do I write, if not to win you back? Is it singly and solely to relieve my mind of its sorrow? To offer my last tribute of admiration upon the altar of unrequited love? Or is it in the hope that in future years you will recall this epistle to memory? or, better still, perhaps this letter will fall upon the floor, from your portfolio, and then its loving words will remind you of a love you once possessed, and could have retained, but for the untoward circumstances of an unkind fate.   298        LOVE ON THE WING. You will destroy it; y es, I know you will, for fear such an event might occur: but there is your memory still; you can't blot it from that. No, not if you marry another: the recollection of this love will go with us to our graves. Your heart is not inaccessible to pity; 'then pity me - think not of yourself, but of me. I am the sufferer, and you - no, not you, 'tis another. If left alone, you would ere now have been mine; but fate, cruel fate, has decreed otherwise. I submit; but not without pro- testing against its unjust mandates. It has caused my heart to be torn from its most cherished idol.- Ha! idol! Is this idolatry? No; it's love, devoted and eternal. Do I worship? Do I adore? No,; but I do, or did. O, Sarah! permit me to love you! While tears are streaming down my face, I ask it. 'Tis but a favor you can but too easily grant, even if wedded to another. I can love you then, and can envy the possessor of so rare a gem. You are a jewel, with which I vainly thought to crown my life; and you would have been the bright- est and' most glorious in it. Other lives and homes you may bless with your presence! But what of mine? shall it be desolate and soli- tary forever? Sarah, forbid; for you, and you alone, can make it happy. O, there may be, yes, doubtless there are, those who are as lovely, as good, as amiable as you, but how shall I, with the recollec- tions of an unrequited love gnawing incessantly at my heart, find one? I cannot; it is impossible; and there is no other resource left for me but to plod on through life's dreary pathway, solitary and alone. "Sarah, you know you promised to be mine: how can you tear it away, and say you won't? You loved me then, and I loved you, and do still, for I can't bring myself to think you have forgotten me. You haven't; it's only a transient feud, of which true love is never exempt. Can love be bandied about in this way, the spot and play of every whim? No, it cannot; for love is of a more enduring metal. Love, when once it is declared, is constant, firm, and true, and no after inci- dents can change it into hatred. Yesterday, you were my promised bride; and, now, alas, what am I? Your scorn, and hate? Say not so; for it's not the way I requite you. You to me will always be the sol- ace of my joy, whether in the arms of another, or in those of none. My every word shall be uttered in your praise, and every thought a mute thanksgiving. I shall rejoice in your happiness, and mourn in your adversity. I shall pray for your health in sickness, and in your death - should I survive - repine. "You know, when first we met, upon the road, you bowed and smiled; and that smile will never be forgot. My heart went leaping, bounding after you in ecstasies and delight. And then the converse in   RICHARD'S LETTER TO SARAH.         299 the library, in which I was undone, both these did chain my heart to you, and there it is, and there it will abide, until death doth sever it. If I could, I would take it back: but it is so torn and mutilated that it would die if I should. -Keep it, keep it alive, and not let it grow cold in your keeping. Yours I have, in the locket, with a curl of your golden hair, wrapped close round in my affections. It's there, preservel from care and danger - a confiding trust. You gave them me to keep, to keep forever, and, you promised me you wouldn't long delay. All this you have forgot, and me cut off from love and sympathy; cut off, forever! O, how I mourn my unhappy lot! And you are happy in my misery! No. God and nature forbid! No one can be happy in extending to a fellow this boon of woe; and to you, it must be torture. And this was why you wouldn't see me: you didn't wish to witness my grief, which you knew would be great, because of the great and bound. less love I had so often declared. You knew my grief would be as deep as my love had been profound, and that my sorrow could find no assuaging balm with which to heal the wound, and that it would remain a festering sore till your love and sympathy were applied. "You haven't forgot the evening when you and I - yes, you needn't smile ironically, and say you don't - sat together, and you, after play- ing upon the piano, with accompaniment of song, 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are marching'-that song and music I have not, nor ever shall, forget. The music of those words still ring in my ear- that voice so sweet and plaintive, with a sadder strain of sorrow for the lost one in cruel battle. O, could I recall that time, and be beyond it in the past, that I might just pass through the joy, unmixed with grief, of that hour! Sarah, will you believe me when I say it was the happi- est I've ever spent?You may, without incredulity. Never before nor since have I seen so happy an hour. The image of it is reflected back, peaceful and serene, even unto-this the saddest and most bitter. hour of my existence. How marked is the contrast! Then a radiant smile of the hope of future happiness beamed upon my brow, where now sits grim and terrible despair. Never till now have I thought the human heart susceptible of such emotions. Yet it is; while I, who was once so joyous, am now the sufferer, and doomed to suffer on, unrequited, unpitied, unreprieved, till death, most welcome, doth end my sorrow, unless, indeed, you to me do extend a sympathizing hand to raise me up to fellowship and love. Could I even hope for this, I might be happy in anticipation. Say, Sarah, say that I may thus hope. You can, but you won't. "You haven't forgotten the time when we sat upon the sofa together   8300        LOVE ON THE WING. you next the stove, and when i put upon your finger the betrothal ring, and how I sealed it with a holy kiss, and let fall a tear of joy, to sanc- tify it? Surely you haven't forgotten all this? And this ring, with its kiss of sacred love, you have torn off and thrown away! O, how painful! I felt my heart torn in two when 'twas done, and didn't know the cause. You didn't do it, I know, but you could have prevented it from being done. You needn't have held out your hand; but if you had kept your finger bent up in your hand, they couldn't have torn it off. And perhaps, too, you have allowed it to be replaced by one who will never redeem it, never make good the softly whispered words of love, whispered in the stillness of the midnight hour, when no other iears were near to hear the words, nor eyes to see the crimson flush of love mantle upon your brow, and none to see the hypocrisy and deceit, of which his soft and pliable heart is filled. And do you rather live in hope on these treacherous assurances, than on my sincere declarations of continuing, eternal love?It cannot be your own choice, for of his unfaithfulness you have not only been warned, but have had ample in- stances illustrated. You cannot hope, unless you hope against hope, that he will make good his promises of other years, say nothing of those of yesterday. But if you prefer it, live on in this inconstancy, for yours is the choice, and it's mine to abide. From this there is no appeal, except to your conscience ; and if you bar the door against this, how can I ever hope for a change? ' You haven't forgotten how happily the swiftly-flying hours sped by, till the gray streaks of morn warned us that it was time to seek the rest pleasant love had denied us? - how we walked the silent paths through the garden, when the crescent, silvery orb hung low in the west, standing sentinel, as it were, for fear some hidden listener might approach, unseen, too near; and how, when an overhanging bough, hanging low, did brush your crimson cheek, you -started, and thought it was a foe; how white and pale you looked, as upward turned towards the silvery moon I saw your face, appealing to know the cause of that which had so frightened you; and when assured 'twas nothing but an intrusive twig, which the gardener bad purposely left to hang to frighten those of timid heart, you did so lovingly recline upon my arm, and cling to me for protection against such another, that I was glad in my heart it happened: not that I was pleased in your fright, but that you would cling with more endearing tenderness to thie arm which would most gladly have held you up through more trying afflictions. You know, too, how 1 tried to lead you that. way again before the moon entirely disappeared behind the hill-top, and you held back, and said,   RICHARD'S LETTER TO SARAH.      -   801 No, no, not there; the dew is falling, and the trailing vines may wet us.' I didl't urge you, but willingly another way we strolled, whis- pering the while, for fear some one might be listening behind the bowr, words of truthful love. -Such words I never uttered before nor since. And when at last the moon sank downi behind the trees and hills, and darkness spread his sable shroud around, except where the moon had just sank a silvery streak stretched around the horizon, we sought the cool, refreshing retreat of the portico, to sit and Watch the receding light as it faded in the west; and when I contrasted the departing moon, as lower and lower she sank, to our own final destiny, you shivered, and leaned closer up, for warmth of sympathy and love; and when you said, ' Think not of that, Richard, but enjoy the present. Let us borrow no trouble from the future, which we know will come plenty soon enough if let alone,' I never mentioned it again, for, thought, if I couldn't be a source of happiness, I wouldn't be of sorrow. The last, more recent, and more painful than all the others, you, of course, remember, but, I trust, not like me, in sorrow. This was all your act, not mine, and what your feelings are I can only divine. Of hatred they can't be, but most probably a mixture of love and con- tempt; but which predominates? If you answer it would be the last, though the first might struggle fearfully against the word, but is sub- dued by the stronger will. What my feelings are, I've but feebly por- trayed; but now we must part, as all, whether true or false, must some time. Let it be understood that I love you, and shall continue to love you, on and forever; and when, in after years, darker clouds gather round, and you need a helping hand or cheering word, come to me, and both are yours. When flowers bloom and fade, as each revolving year rolls round, upon our graves, when the sordid considerations of life shall have been done away, we will meet, and perhaps love, in other lands, where flowers never fade, where night and darkness never come, and where sorrow and sadness are never known. "Believe me, Sarah, to be, both now and then, "Your lover and friend, "RICHARD."    i     3302        LOVE ON THE WING. K              C HACHAPTER XLIV. RICHARD AND THE ORPHANS.-LAKE SCENE. "WE will now return to the little orphans, whom we left sleeping so happily in Mrs. Lovell's spare bed. Flora's vas a religious, turn of mind; and, as she, in fact both the girls, went each Sabbath to church, and regularly attended the Sabbath school, she early became a consistent and devout member of the Presbyterian faith. She was received into the bosom of this church in the winter of '65, and as a worshipper she was not excelled in devout, Christian piety by any of the members of the flock; each day, unless, indeed, the weather or her health forbade, before and after school, she went around to all the more unfortunate, though useful classes, and gathered together the little children, into groups, and by pleasant words, and winning smiles, suc- ceeded in getting many into the Sabbath school, where, though they were not so extravagantly dressed as the rest, they were distributed around among the several classes. In this way many children whom Christ had commanded to be brought unto Him, were redeemed from their wicked ways, and finally, through the influence of the Sabbath-school -teaching, were brought into the fold of Christ, and afterwards became useful and influential members of society. Many in after years traced their reclamation back to the untiring efforts of this little terrestrial angel. ,    ' All the children blessed her, and when she was seen coming, they all ran, and crowded around her so much that she could with great difficulty get along. Each wished her to come to his house; this one wanted a kiss, and that one, each receiving it, however dirty his face might be, as fast as they applied; although not unfrequently her hand- kerchief became necessary before the kiss was palatable, and for this purpose she carried an extra one. The children all blessed her; even those whose parental injunctions, forbade them going with Miss Ben- tley, came up to get the kiss, which she as freely gave them as to the others. In this way all the neutral children were gathered into the school. - And for one little boy, named John Young, whose clothes for- bade his attendance, and whose parents would not think of clothing him better in order that he mightgo (for they thought it a useless expen- diture, and would never make him any better), she bought a suit for him, and then he came regularly to school. This boy now promises to   RICHARD ATTRACTED TO FLORA.         303 become an intelligent and respected member of the church, and he traces it wholly to the influence of the Sabbath school. Everybody looked upon her as a little loving angel, and her pres- ence was always remarked as she passed to and from the school. She is now in her sixteenth year, and applies herself unremittingly to her books and her studies, learning readily and retaining what she once acquires. Helen always accompanies her to school, but never in her suburban rambles; for Helen could not bear to enter a dingy kitchen, nor endure the fragrance of onion, boiling cabbage, and garlic. They are both quick to learn, and they entered into their studies with zest, and a desire to excel all others in their respective classes. Richard saw little of the girls, as he was away mostly; but on Sat- urday evening he was usually at home to attend church with them and mother on the Sabbath. As they were not going to be an expense, Richard thought that, perhaps; enough could be saved from the price which was paid them for their support to purchase a piano; conse- quently one was procured the year previous and placed in the parlor, right under the portrait of George Washington, which had hung un- disturbed so many years. They received lessons on the piano Satur- days from Miss -- , the best teacher and pianist in the village. This, with drawing, and their school duties, consumed all their time. When- ever they had any difficulty in solving their problems, they came to Richard with them, who gladly assisted them over many troublesome examples. They were of mutual advantage to each other. Richard corrected- many little mistakes which otherwise would have gone unnoticed, and consequently unimproved; and they refined his rougher nature, and entirely removed that brusque, headstrong, harum-scarum style which was before so remarkable with him. Every word was criticised, and everything smacking of the slangish was carefully erased from their vo- cabulary. The manners too of each did not escape the criticism that were due them. Though these are generally caught up intuitively, yet some little corrections and alterations are often due novitiates, or else 'they are apt to get a wrong interpretation. Only a word is necessary to correct any little error, which, if spoken at the right time and in the right spirit, cannot fail of its effect. They received as careful a train- ing under Richard and his mother's superintendence as other ladies receive in more elaborate and expensive households; and Richard, since his dismissal, seemed to pay more than ordinary attention to the education of the ladies, and especially to Flora, whom he began to re- gard with especial interest. He had taken it much at heart; but when   304        LOVE ON THE WING. he came home, (and saw with how much beauty and grace Flora was adorned, he began to feel that it was not so much of a privation after all, as he had at first supposed. The cloud which had gathered upon his brow was dispelled, and sunshine in a short time irradiated from his face. All his spare moments were devoted to the ladies, who, by their assiduous applications, amply repaid him for all the care he be- stowed by the pleasure he experienced in seeing them progress so fast. "As all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy," so all study and no recreation makes children tired and stupid; so Richard managed quite frequently, in the spring and summer, to escort the ladies of an evening, when the sun was just sinking behind the hills, on an eques- trian circuit; for their horses were brought up and pastured on a neigh- bor's farm in the summer, and in the winter stabled on the place. And on other occasions a sail upon the lake was had, always varying the amusements so as not to become sick of either. In the winter they had their skates and sleighs, and as their fancy, or the state of the weather permitted, each was enjoyed. Flora always loved these relaxations; but she never entered into them with such full glee and hearty good will as was characteristic of Helen; for she had only to hear the mention of a sail, when she was on tiptoe in a moment, and all impatient for an instant start; and any- thing she could do to help the others get ready she did. She always preceded the rest of the party, and arrived first at the boat, into which she would leap without waiting for a word from Richard; and he could never find it in his heart to reprove her, or tell her to wait till he had tyS the boat ready,. while Flora waited upon the wharf till the sail was properly adjusted, when she stepped carefully in. The evening was beautiful, and a gentle breeze lifted the sparkling waves to the smile of the setting sun. The boat flew swiftly across the little waves, tacking this way and then that, till the little village, nestled so snugly beneath the rising hills and towering trees, seemed but a little speck of shrubbery. The homes of the farmer, the orchards and the meadows, were reflected back peaceably from the clear bosom of the lake. The lambs were sporting merrily upon the hill-side, and the whistle of the ploughboy rang shrill and harsh across the lake; but the music of his soul was in it, and as such it was pleasant. The low- ing of the cows as they were being driven to the yard, echoed far up through the valleys, and all nature seemed to smile so sweetly that hardly one word was spoken by any of the party for some time, each being absorbed with thoughts which, if uttered, would break their charm. !S   SAIL ON THE LAKE.           305 "O, how lovely this is! 'Every sight we see, and every sound we hear, adds so much more to the beauty of the whole!"Flora ex- claimed, clapping her hands in the ecstasy of her joy. "I could live forever, nd be contented, if such a scene as this could always be before me," Helen said, less enthusiastic than her sister. "We must remember that this is the brightest side of the picture, and that life, to be lively, must have its clouds, must have its storms of wind, and rain, an4 ice, and snow. " "O, please, Richard, don't moralize now; for surely we've had our share of the clouds, which, I think, have hung continually over us, from the beginning until now. Let us have sunshine, if we can," Flora said, petulantly, looking more lovely than cross. "Excuse me, Flora, for my mind is so monotonous that it is always obscured by the misty clouds of speculation; and I never, like the rest of the gay world, look on the lighter side. I need more of this kind of life, and I shall look to you and Helen for it. Shall I look in vain " "If you'll copy after me, another dark cloud will never cross your mind," Helen put in quickly, accompanied by one of her roguish smiles. "Whatever clouds you have on your mind, you needn't express them in words, so as to darken the minds of others," Flora said, meet- ing his friendly look with a coyish, retreating glance. "I'll try after this, and not darken your bright thoughts with my clouded mind. I suppose then I must say nothing, unless I say light, happy thoughts?" he asked. "It would be more pleasant to those around if only such thoughts were expressed; still, I suppose there are times when it would be well enough to look and think upon the darker side, but not in the midst of such a scene as this. Where everything is eloquent with the activity of life, I think we might be permitted to drink undisturbed; and then, after our thirst for- the light and beautiful is quenched, let us turn to the other spring and drink there, taking care however not to drink too much," she said, smiling. "You needn't caution anybody about not drinking too much there, for I know of none who would willingly drink there at all, unless it is Richard, who seems made up of contraries," Helen retorted, casting a a look of mingled sarcasm and fun at Richard, who said nothing, but smiled sweetly. Come, let us turn back, Richard. See! the sun is almost down, and the village is out of sight. We must be four or five miles from 26#   306      LOVE ON THE WING. home. If we should get caught out here after dark, we couldn't find the place to land," Flora said, beseechingly. So Richard- turned round, and steered for home; and when about two miles from the shore, the band came out, and struck up "Down in Dixie." The sound came along in a soft and gentle melody, the dis- tance robbing it of that harsh, grating sound, so painful to the ear when-close at hand. It lacked, too, that bravado sound which had thrilled the souls of young patriots to march to the tqne, and lay low a fellow. But now, the sounds were merged in peace so full, so rich, and so melodious, that they listened in bated breath to the sweet harmony as it wafted gently over the rippling waves. It seemed as if the musicians' souls were speaking out in trumpet tones the melody which thrilled their being, or as if their souls were tired of the long imprisonment, and were breathing out the music which filled themin tones that vibrated through every fibre of the hearer. The excursion- ists said not a word; but in silence and in awe drank in the musical strains as if they were liquid streams. They sailed round and round in that twilight hour in raptures of perfect bliss, and they felt then as if no alloy had ever been mixed in their cups of pleasure; sorrow such as theirs only refines and purifies the soul for the enjoyment of more subtile essences. The grosser feelings had been eradicated, and finer ones ingrafted upon the bruised stem, and the enthusiasm which they manifested on this occasion showed that they were susceptible of those fine and more delicate emotions which fill the soul with ideas of a kindred nature to those of God. The music ceased, and they started for the shore, well pleased with their sail. They thanked Richard for his kindness in taking them out to enjoy such a rich, rare pleasure; and, after securing the boat, they proceeded towards the house which they entered just as Mrs. Lovell was seating herself by the table. O, mother! you ought to have been with us, we've had such a de- lightful time!"Richard exclaimed, as he entered the house on a run ahead of the girls, who vainly tried to catch him. "O, dear! I'm tired to death. But, O, how we've enjoyed ourselves this evening. I wish ever so much we could take a sail every evening," Helen said, her face all aglow by the exercise to which she had sub- jected herself. "Every evening would be too often, and instead of its being a pleas- ure, it would be tiresome," Richard said. "It might to you, but not to me. I could enjoy it -forever," she said, rapturously.   FLORA SINGS FOR RICHARD.         307 "I don't hardly think you would enjoy it so very much if you in- dulged in it so often. Pleasures are the sweetest when they are most rare," Richard said  "I should like to be satisfied, anyway, and maybe I will some time," she said, a little pettishy. "Yes, when you get tipped over, and half drowned, and then maybe you'll be contented to remain longer on terra firma, and less on the treacherous waves." "O, how frightened I am at the 'treacherous waves'!" "Are they always safe?" he asked. Is the land always safe?" she asked, looking triumphantly. "You can't answer a question by asking one." "Still I've silenced the ' treacherous waves' argument. "Have you? I suppose we are as liable to die on land as on water from natural causes; still no accident save that of the discharge of a gun, or the fall of a house upon us, could so easily deprive us of life as the upsetting of a boat. Why is Flora so still, who a few moments ago was so happy?" he asked, looking towards her. O, I was only thinking of that music, how sweet it was!" "Yes, it was; it was fine. But conie, let us have the same tune on the piano," and Flora rose without the usual coaxing of a quarter of an hour, and gracefully seated herself at the piano, played the tune slowly and finely, accompanying it with the words. The volume of sound was too great for the room, and it sounded better to have the doors all open, and let it escape into the open air. Flora's voice was naturally good, and the little training'she had received had improved it immensely. It was full and clear, without that sharp, shrill sound of some, as soon as they strike the higher-notes. She measured the compass of her voice so accurately that she rose gradually to the higher notes of the scale, and sang them in a clear, full voice, and then as easily descended, and apparently without much effort. She had only learned some common national airs as yet, not having advanced into the more mysterious realms of mixed pianic confusion; and Richard never liked those far-fetched, hum-drum, casta-diva tunes, which pierce the ear with sounds unmelodious and as indistinguishable as those a new beginner would strike in the vain effort of producing a tune. Some simple, national air, in which the parts were separate and dis- tinct, and each note of the parts clear and full, such were the tunes in which he delighted, though he often complimented a lady for playing well, just because he would be gallant, and because it was fashionable, without however feeling perfectly satisfied.   308        LOVE ON THE WING. 'Bridget waited for her Lothario that evening, for she couldn't think of sleep without first being satisfied as to the success of her plans. She didn't want Richard to marry yet, because she was not yet positive that William would marry her, though she had said her chance was as good as anybody's. Few would concur with her in this conclusion; any way, she wouldn't have Richard marry until she was married to William; then he might marry whom he was a mind to. She spoke of this step in very complimentary words to Richard' himself, and she said " if it hadn't been for me, he Should have merried long time ago; but she wasn't ready yet to have lim merry; fur if she couldn'i have a feller, she would let him know he wouldn't have anybody else.' Her great strategical foresight -prevented this. She knew what she was about, and didn't care for nobody, neither; "fur if they didn't like her style, they might drive on to the next post." "And she'd clear, all the old coveys out of there who didn't toe up to the mark." Such lessons Richard frequently heard from her, so he knew just what he could depend upon. William always reflected the impressions to which he had been exposed, and in this way by a word one could tell pretty near with whom he had been talking, and what was the sub- ject; for oftentimes he would use a word or more which a gentleman would avoid, and which no one but the lowest would permit himself to use. In this way Richard surmised a great deal, and he studied long upon the complicated issues involved in this case, until he arrived at the root of the motives of each of the parties. William had told Richard that he never began a thing without car- rying it through; neither would he give up, for any trivial cause, a scheme he had undertaken. It might take time, but he was good for it. He had seldom been outwinded. He could wait as long as anybody. Richard could easily draw his own inferences from such words; and if he was not sufficiently attentive, or discourteous, a short, cutting sar- casm reminded him of his duty; such as, "' I wonder that loggerhead don't mind his business;" or "that shackle-brained fellow is get- ting very shiftless," and such words, with a sprinkling of expletives, which, though adding a little emphasis, might as well have been omitted. Such words he used in Richard's presence, and directed to- wards somebody else; but Richard, knew very well who was meant. William always left a wide latitude for others to guess what were his wishes and intentions; and if he 'ould get any one to criticise another, in words sarcastic, vulgar, or profane, he, without showing any signs of pleasure, felt gloriously over it. As soon as William came in, she asked to know if " he kissed her."   BRIDGET PROPOSES TO WILLIAM.         309 "Hush! hush! or somebody will hear you. No, of course not;, it. wasn't necessary," he replied, impatiently. "Wall, will she ship him?" she asked, in. eagerness. "I think she will," he replied, carelessly. "That's all I wanted to know. He'll go down there, I suppose, Sunday," she said, thoughtfully. "Wall, if he does, he'll know, when he gets there, that - he needn't come again, unless on business," he said, sarcastically. "Now, I suppose. all we'll have to do will be to get ready, and merry as soon as we can," "Yes, and the quicker the better." "Who do you mean?" she. asked, a little agitated. "Why, Richard, of course," he replied, surprisedly. "Well, I hain't goin' to merry no Richard, now I can tell you that," she said, angrily. "Why, I thought you was very anxious for me to go down there and cut him out, so you could marry him." ' So he wouldn't merry her. I don't want him, for I ain't taken up with such trash." "Wall, now, that's strange, I declare. I supposed you was all the while anxious to marry him," he said, slowly and blandly. "Wall, you see I hain't - don't you?" "Yes, but I'm sorry for it. I was in hopes you would marry him." "I hain't goin' to merry till I merry you; and you needn't think I'm goin' to stay here all the while, neither, for I hain't, an' have all the folks a talkin' about me. I suppose you think I can bear everythin'- do you?" she asked. ". well, I wouldn't think of that. You'd better marry while you've a good chance, and not delay, for delays are dangerous, you know. Say you'll marry him before he gets entangled somewhere else," he slowly and sweetly said. "Wall, let him get himself entangled, if he wants to; I don't care for him. I want somebody, so I won't have to work quite so hard. This merryin' poor as a church mouse I don't believe in. Give me a rich feller," she said, haughtily, but towards the last her tone softened down. "Wall, you won't have to work hard if you marry him; and you can stay here, and do as much as you are a mind to. There won't. be anybody to drive you about." "I should like to see anybody try it; wouldn't I give him lemuns, though? I'd learn him to mind his own business." "1   1i      31O!LOVE ON THE WING. "Wall, there won't be anybody to try it, so you needn't be alarmed. Wall, come, come, clear out, and let us go to bed, for it's quite late," he said, looking up to the clock. "Yes, I've got to go up there in the cold. Now, you see, if we was merried, how nice it would be to go to bed in a warm room," she said, looking in the-direction of the bed-room door. "Yes, but don't think about that now: clear out!" "I'll clear you out," she said, rising; and again rough-and-tumble scuffle was had about the room, much to the annoyance of the other occupants of the house, who thought such boisterous conduct rather unbecoming the man of the house. CHAPTER XLV. ISAAC AND WILL.--BRIDGET AND WILL. W'ILLIAM did not go down before the week was out to arrange the preliminaries of the approaching nuptials, as he had prom- ised. The next week rolled round, and he did'not come, neither was anything said about his coming, except what Sarah and - Ellen said in the house; and if we should attempt to give all they said, it would swell this volume to an enormous size. We will content ourselves with what Isaac had to Say to him. Isaac had said so much, and it had been received in such a manner, that he was exceedingly averse to saying anything further to him; for it always made him so angry to see the debonair style of William, who, without the least manifestation of anger, received his most bitter sarcasms without a murmur; and when he asked if he was coming down to see Sarah, he said, "In a few days." "What did you want to come down here the other evening for, if you had no intention of pursuing further this negotiation "Isaac asked, in a quick, agitated tone. "Wall, I thought you would like to see me again, and form my ac- quaintance; seeing, it was so long since any of you had seen me, I thought I was considerable of a stranger," he replied, slowly, his eyes upon a stick he was whittling. "Stranger! and it would be better for us if you were one now, and always to remain such. Well, now, I should like to knoR what you   ISAAC TRIES TO SCARE WILLIAM.         31 really intend doing, anyway Do you mean to live like this always  or what in the name of Samuel do you mean?" he asked, growing a little more wrathy. "You never heard, 1 suppose, how Mr. Brown answered such a question - have you " he asked, still whittling. "No, I hain't, neither do I want to hear. My business is with you, not with anybody else. I want to know if you intend living in this way; and if you do, I want you to understand this, that our business relations are closed, for I'm bound if I'll have anything to do with such a man. I'll sell that farm, and close up with you," he said, pretty angrily, yet there was room for more. "Wall, I'll buy it. How much do you ask for it?" he asked, per- fectly willing to accept peace on that condition. "I won't sell it to you, for I don't think you are competent to man- age it, under existing circumstances," he said, little mollified to think his threat had had no more effect. "Wall, you might as well sell it to me as anybody, and it will be all in the family then; and I always thought I would never like to see the old farm, where we were all born and brought up, pass into the hands of strangers," he said, rather persuasively. "Wall, that's so; I guess I'll let you have it. I'll see. I suppose you hain't in any hurry yet?" he asked, quite pleased. "No, any time you are ready will please me." We'll settle that some other time, but now I want to know about this other business. - Are you going to marry? that's what I want to know; and if you are not, I'll sell out the Hart Lot property, and dissolve partnership with you in everything. It's shameful for any man to have anything to do with you, for it reflects equally upon every man who will tolerate such a crying nuisance in the commu- nity in which he lives; and I, for one, will not be implicated in such a notorious scandal." "Wall, I suppose I'll have to take the brunt of it all on my shoul- ders, and I'm pretty stout yet," he said, rather decidedly. "' Yes, and this is all the satisfaction one gets for his trouble. I'd be a man and a gentlemen, if I could." "I'm trying that every day; and if I had not been pretty successful, I don't know but I would have been sued before now, for assault and battery," he said, wittily.     , "You wouldn't be, by me, anyway. I suppose you think you have exercised a good deal of moderation towards me, while I've exercised none "'   312        LOVE ON THE WING. "No, O, no, not that at all; I was referring to that fellow who told me to go where he wouldn't be willing to accompany me,", he said, twirling the closed knife in his hand. I know what you would infer very well, so you needn't palm it off in that way. I should think Bordman would be ashamed of herself; but, no, it's her doings, and she thinks the consequences are all right, whether they reflect discredit, dishonor, and shame upon her or not. I wonder she isn't disturbed in her sleep by the ghosts of her deceased parents." O, I guess it isn't quite so bad as that yet, and I hope it never will be," he said, slowly, and rising from his seat, walked to the window, preparatory to an exit through the door, which stood close by. "So you're not coming down again, then?"Isaac asked, observing him closely. "O, yes, I hope so. I don't want to be so mean as that. Certainly I'm coming down," he replied, holding the door-knob in his hand, which he was slowly turning back and forth. "Wall, we'll see how long it will be first." Bridget had heard somehow what Isaac had said respecting her- self, and the words not being very complimentary of her, she again renewed the subject, though somewhat later than would appear by be- ing so closely connected here. These words had so greatly incensed her, that she resolved to leave the place forthwith, and not have such scan- dalous stories set afloat about her. She resolved, too, not to come back until respectably married to William. So in the spring of. 1866 she packed up bag and baggage, and started 'for home in tears, because of the ungrateful manner in which she was used. She protested her in- nocence of any breach of good morals, and was as good and as respect- able as anybody; and as for Isaac Wood, or anybody else, to cast such insinuations against her, she wouldn't stand it. She didn't start right off, but staid for William to coax and tease her for about two hours; then, as there were no signs of relenting, and as time began to press pretty heavily he withdrew; but not until she had cried and simpered all she could, did she give up, and resort to the other more trying ex- pedient of absenting herself entirely, determined to make him marry her from sheer necessity, or else go without her valuable services. He couldn't live without her, of course, for no one in the wide world could make butter equal to her, and no one could keep a house look- ing so well; no one could get up such a meal; no one could make such a bed, and consequently he would have to marry her in order to get these things done. He wouldn't marry any one else, for no one would suit him, no one would please him so well as she.   BRIDGET LECTURES WILLIAM.         313 She knew all this, and what would--be the use of knowing it if she couldn't profit by it? She would get William, she knew, if she staid away long enough, and-so she went away, resolving to stay until he married her back; and that wouldn't be very long, for the work would have to be done before a great while, and when he wanted it done, all he would have to do would be to come down and marry her, and she'd come back and do it. She didn't tell- all this to everybody, only to William, and he knew what would bring her back. He would give her money, and watches, and diamond rings, and ear-rings, and silk dresses, if she would only come back and just tend to the house. No she wouldn't; she wouldn't do any such thing; for wasn't her immaculate character worth more than all his jewelry, dresses, and fixins? Perhaps you don't think it is, but I do.  "I'm going to take care of my karacter myself; and if I didn't, I guess I wouldn't have any a great while. You perserve anybody's kar- acter! You can't' perserve your own. What do you think my father and mother would say if they should hear what your brother and his folks say about me? They'd be jumpin' mad in a minit, and they wouldn't let me come back here again for all the world. You needn't send after me, for I won't come; an' unless you come after me, an' merry me, as you should, an' make a decent woman of me, I'll never set foot in this house no more. Now you just mind it, will you. Pretty stories goin' round about me, ain't they? an' you'd sit there an' not say one word fur me, you miserable, good-for-nothing imp. You're nothin' but a nuisance to have round anybody, an' there's no more life in you than there is in a clam; an' as fur ambition, or a manly spirit, you hain't got none. If I had a boy, an' you was his father, I'd take him by the heels an' smash his brains out against the led-post, if he didn't know no more at six years than you know now, so I would. You needn't look at me so lovin' like; I mean it, every word on it. You're nothin' but a goose without brains, without good sense, an' without self-respect." O, don't talk so about me; you'll make me think I 'ain't anybody." "That's just what I want to make you think; an' until somebody makes you think so, you won't be a man. I wish I was a man, I'd show you what to do. I'll slash the ground with them fellers that have been talkin' so about me; and if you had any gumption about you, you would do it. But, no, you ain't that man. I can stay here, an' do your drudg- ery furyou, an' be abused by everybody else, an'-you can't say a word fur me, but let me go right on just so every day, day after day, week in an' week out, an' so on clear through the year. I tell you I won't 27   314        LOVE ON THE WING. stand it no longer, fur I've borne it, an' said nothin' these three long years, an' you never opened your old gob to say yes of no fur me. That's the way you've used me fur all I've done fur you, an' now I'm sick of it, an' I'm goin' home, where I shall be better used an' better fed. I've got a good, kind mother at home, an' she'll see that there don't any- body talk so about me. If she gets her finger into their wool once I'll bet it'll fly. There is no use of talkin' to you, an' I might as well go out there an' talk to the wind; but now I'll try an' see what deeds will do, fur I've talked myself crazy now, an' I hain't marde no more im- pression than my talk has on that mantelpiece. Now we'll see how you'll get along when I'm gone, so good by to you." "See here, you ain't going yet.. I want to tell you what I'll do. I'll give you five dollars a week if you'll stay: you needn't say anything about it though." "I wouldn't stay if you'd give me a hundred dollars a week; that's the way you've been foolin' me all along, an' I don't mean to be fooled- so no more. Now you can just set that down in your books." "Say, hold on; I'll get you a diamond ring for a Christmas present if you'll stay." "I won't do it. I wouldn't stay here for all the julery in the city. I can work here an' get nothin' but julery an' abuse from your family an' friends. I'm sick of it, an' won't stand it no more." "Say, hold on; I'll tell you what I'll do if you will stay. I'll get you a gold watchand a diamond ring the next time I go to the city." "I won't do it. I told you I wouldn't before, now I tell you behind, so you'll have it told all around you. You promised to give five hun- dred dollars the other time we had a blow-up, and you hain't gave it to me yet; an' I won't do another stitch of work till I get it, now I tell you." "Wall, say, I tell you what rll do. Ill sign a note now for five hun- dred dollars, and put it right into your'fist, if you'll stay right where you are and go to work. Now, hain't that fair?" "' Yes; well, less see you do it. I'll go down home-anyway, an' have my visit out, seein' I've started. I won't have 'em think that I'd back out nohow. So less have the note,an' 'll start." But, say, you were to stop and, go to work if I gave you this. Wasn't that the condition?" "Yes; but I guess it won't make' no difference if I go down there an' stay a week or so, will it?" "Well, say, come back next Sunday," handing her the note, ' and I'll send a horse and buggy after your Will you come "   WILLIAM  TRIES TO SOOTHE BRIDGET.       315 "Yes, I guess so, if you'll merry me between this an' next fall. Will you do that?" "I shouldn't like to make any promises about that, for fear I shouldn't have time. It won't make any difference about marrying, for you can stay here just as well, and we'll never mind the talk of these tattlers, who mind everybody's business but their own," he said, slowly and sweetly.  You may never mind them, but I shall; for you've nothin' to lose, an' I have, by what they say." "Wall, say now, it won't make a particle of difference to either of us, provided we don't-notice it; by not noticing it, you see, they will think there is not one word of truth in the report. The more monstrous a lie is, the more impossible it will be to be believed; and if the libelled, receive with indifference the libel of the libeller, the libeller will shrink in shame and confusion from the guiltless faces of those whom he has wronged." "Wall, would it be a libel? for I thought libels was a something that wasn't true," she said, eyeing him with mingled fear and love. "So it is. It is a veritable lie, got up for the purpose of injuring the innocent and inoffensive; and I tell you the less attention you pay such a thing, the less liable it will be to be accepted as true; conse- quently, our course is plain, and that is, to steer right through, without heeding the impudent insinuations of the vulgar," "Wall, I shan't do it, there! But if it was all a lie, I might. I'll have to put on a purty face--wouldn't I?-to look it down, and me a member of the church. What do you suppose will come of me, if this goes on?" she asked, bursting out in a flood of tears, which Wil- liam could not see unmoved. He sighed, and drawing his handker- chief from his pocket, and giving it a couple of flirts, brushed the mist from his eyes, and said, "There, now, I wouldn't cry about it, for that won't do any good whatever. I wouldn't let folks think I felt so about it, for it only makes it worse," he said, soothingly. "Wall, I don't care. Boo-hoo-boo-hoo! You might, might- boo-hoo-hoo! you might me- boo-hoo!-merry - boo-hoo-hoo! - me- and save my - boo-ho-hoo - karacter from -boo-hoo-hoo! - from defamition or - boo-hoo-hoo! - or somethin'," she said, weep- ing hysterically. "Wall, you see, if I had time, it would be well enough to think about it; but as it is, we'd better wait until a better opportunity presents itself," he said, more encouragingly than ever.   316        LOVE ON THE WING. "Wall, I won't wait-- there! for I've waited these three years, an' you've kept puttin' me off in this way all the time; an' now I think it's my turn to have a say about it. Boo-hoo-hoo!" "Wall, you see, I've been so busy, and I've had so much to do, that there hasn't been a moment I could call my own. But say, you go ahead, and do up the work, and then, if you 'must go, I'll send you down. I must be goinkjnow, for you see it's getting lte," he said, taking out his watch and holding it up before her; and then he fumbled his keys and pennies, as he moved impatiently, yet happily, around the room. "I don't want you to send me down, for I can go a-foot, and no thanks to you or your horses; but when you want me to come back, you will have to come and merry me, or else you'll never see me here again. So good by. I hain't goin' to say nothin' more to you." "Say, now, I wouldn't go off in that way. Say, you can just as well have a horse as not -got lot of 'em iri the barn. Say, come back here. Hold on a minnit; I'll call 'John, and have him harness right up," he said, going to the door, and yelling after her, who by this time had arrived at the gate, and finally, before he finished, some ways up the road. She answered back some vulgar word about him and his horses, and then disappeared. It is not only surprising that such scenes should occur in the life of a man, but that anybody moderate and lenient enough could be found who would tolerate such a person about him is the strangest of all. These scenes, in a less malignant form, had occurred quite frequently before; but they had each been quelled by the promise of some pres- ent, the presents growing in value as each triumph was achieved, until at last she drew on him to the extent of five hundred dollars. I have grouped these all together, as it were, so as not to have to recur to them again. Storms usually arose about once or twice a week, and on some very important occasions, every other day. They were rather expensive to William, but to her they were showers of presents; and for these they were often provoked. If he had been wise on the start, he might have foreseen that, should he concede once, he would have to again; whereas, if he had kept her in check from the beginning, he would have had less trouble, and been to far less expense. But he was the weaker vessel, and he was foolish enough to think that the means he employed to quench the flames of her furious passion would eventually smother them, whereas, they only served to increase them. The proper way would have been to use her simply as a -hired servant, in which capacity she had served from infancy, and for which she was   FINE FEATHERS.           317 only fitted. An inch given to such, and they think they are ill used if they can't have a mile; and she vainly strove to elevate herself to a lady, for which her manners and education entirely unfitted her: for "pygmies on Alps are pygmies still." It would not only have been a gross sacrilege on the name of a lady, but instead of elevating her, would have lowered her beyond her just level-beyond where she would have been had she never seen William. She was already the object of the sneers of her comrades, apd the contempt of her betters. The meanest Irishman thought it no credit to ride with her, and often it was a matter of dispute and fear among them who would be the one selected to drive the horse on any occasion; for she, in affecting the style of better and more graceful models, made such awkward blunders, that those who witnessed them could not help snickering under their handkerchiefs. It must not be forgotten that her patronage was very valuable to her poor and more unfortunate fellow-countrymen, many of whose wants were supplied from the cellar of William, in the form of milk, butter, eggs, and meat; and these, if anybody offended her, would be denied, and sure starva- tion awaited the. sufferers, unless they asked, timely and in humility, for forgiveness. Those Irishmen who daily associated with her didn't wish to be sub- jected' to the awkward annoyances which her unbecoming manners provoked; and she wouldn't hesitate, if they, too, joined with her de- tractors against her, even in public and on the street to upbraid them in language neither polite nor affable. She thought her dress, and "jewelry," and diamond ring, and gold watch, were entitled to more respect than were awarded her; and she often said, when returned from church, that " fine feathers made fine birds, and she had the finest feathers of all." She would brook no taunts nor jeers from her poor sisters, who often sighed as she swept up the aisle, which hardly per- mitted her enormous skirts to pass without brushing against each side. Her presence was always greeted by a cloud of incense and the perfume of a thousand flowers, which she breathed in silent satisfac- tion, believing she was creating a sensation which others would vainly attempt to emulate. The. scene above recorded occurred about three years before ithe close of this story, and since then she has packed up and gone home three times, declaring each time she would never set foot on the place again. The first time, and that we have but feebly portrayed, she re- mained away one week, when she came back of her own accord, her trunk being brought back at night, so as to prevent any one from 27*   J   318        LOVE ON THE WING. , l1 knowing it had been returned. The last time she took her things down, and that was in the fall of '69, upon the occasion of her last encounter with Carmen in the hop-lot, they had been increased to three large trunks, from the satchel she used to carry on her arm from house to house, seeking the menial occupation of nursing a young one, or care for its invalid mother. 'It required the united strength of a team and barouche to draw these home, from which they have not yet returned, and it is hoped they never will, by those who have the good of society in view, and also by her friends, who cannot fail to foresee the ultimate fall of one who now staggers from her dizziness. CHAPTER XLVI. SARAH AND THE LETTER. SARAH received the letter, and read it, not without tears, to the  end. She pronounced it the best she had ever seen, and so did Isaac and Ellen. They all regretted very much the pain this had necessarily caused Richard; but they consoled themselves with the thought that he would never again allow himself to fall so deeply in love as not to be able to extricate himself without feeling so deeply the embarrassment of an unrequited love in case of such another accident. They were very sorry that circumstances had so shaped themselves as to forbid the union of such apparent, sincere love as his and Sarah's; for she, against the remonstrance of her sister, was half inclined to reply, and let William go, as he had gone. It would be serving Wil- liam as he deserved, to cut him as he had her; but no, this could not be thought of, for she would be spiting herself did he really entertain serious thoughts on the subject. It was once half decided to answer it, in order to retain Richard in case William again gave them the slip; but they were so sure that William's conscience had smitten him, because of the counsels he had received from his friends, that he would comply with so simple a re- quest. Sarah thought from the beginning that these had not influ- enced him, but that Richard being engaged to her, and which, if they were married, would conflict with his plans and with Bridget's matri- monial prospects. Isaac and Ellen thought differently. He would not do such a thing, to accomplish such a purpose, for it was unworthy a     v SARAH AND THE LETTER.          319 gentleman. They had done plenty bad enough in getting Richard down there, but he would be doing far worse, if such motives as those which Sarah presented,were really the main ones to get him back. "It can't be possible that William would do such a thing, for it would brand him as a veritable knave if it were known. He would not only be playing the hypocrite to us, but also the villain to Richard," Ellen said, folding up the letter carefully, which Isaac had just handed to her, saying, - "It was a pity he loved her so much. Poor boy! he is worthy a better fate, and a heart not less devoted than Sarah's. If I had known he loved thus, I don't know but I would have thought twice before I consented to his dismissal." "Wall, I can just drop one line to him, and he will wait if it is thought best. I am fully persuaded that William has done this merely to prevent him marrying me; for if he was going to pay'any attention to those gentlemen, he would not have waited till now. An influence brought to bear upon him a year ago would not now for the first be felt," said Sarah, emphatically. "Wall, it does look pretty plausible, I must confess; but it is the very objectionable features of it that make it so very improbable to my mind that William should do such a thing. Should anybody else do so, or in fact one half as bad, his voice would be raised against it," Ellen said, horrified. Isaac was again reading the letter which he had taken from the tablle where Ellen laid it, and, consequently, was not paying any attention to the conversation between the sisters. As he came to some of the most pathetic passages, his eyes dimmed, and, thinking his glasses were dirty, he laid it down with a sigh, and then taking his glasses off, he wiped them with his handkerchief. He again took up the sheet, and found his vision not improved, or else it was most horrid writing, and it was. It was blotted with ink, and blurred with tears - tears that Richard had shed, as he bent over that sheet, during the silent mid- night hours. He finished it at last, and with a sigh of regret for a love that was so devotedly sincere, that not one word of censure had he to bestow on those who, he must have known, were the authors of his trouble.. He arose to go, and Sarah, calling to him, asked, - "Well, what is the decision? Shall I answer it or not?I leave it all with you." "You may do as you wish. You have my consent; but ask Ellen, and do as she says." "Well, respected sister, what shall I do, answer this letter, or throw   320        LOVE ON THE WING. it into the fire, to burn with all such worthless trash?" she asked, as Isaac left the house. "Wall, I guess you had better wait a little while, and then if he don't continue his attentions, you can write, or Isaac can invite him down again. I don't think it will be too late, even in a year, for, you can say you forgot it, and you hope he will be kind enough to overlook a negligence which was by no means intentional," she replied. "So I must wait. Wall, the responsibility is all removed from my shoulders, even in the face of my protest. The policy you would have me pursue will lose me both; but then, to please you, I submit. On me the weight of the burden comes, which, whether good or bad, I must bear," she returned, sorrowfully. "O, wall, if you are going to feel so bad about it, you had better write and take all the responsbility upon yourself. I should think that as we all manifest such an anxious solicitude for you, you would be willing to rely implicitly upon our judgment, and do nearly as we desire," she returned, pettishy. "O, well, you needn't get mad about it, for I guess it concerns me fully as much as anybody, and I think now my right course is to strike off from both of you and marry Richard; for I am pretty well per- suaded that if I don't I shall marry neither. By failing to accept this offer, or rather to retain it, I forfeit his love, and neveragain can I re- claim it, no matter how urgent may be my wish; therefore what I do now, if I persist in this rejection, I do at the sacrifice of a kind, loving, and devoted husband. He yet is mine, if I relent, and I can keep him forever; whereas, by trying to get William, I lose both." Thus they argued for some time, both getting angry, and as often, after a rebuke, returning to sisterly: loie. The upshot of the whole was, that she didn't write to him, neither did William come down from that day to this. He sometimes though, even now, upon Isaac's spe- cial invitation, goes down and takes tea, but never visits with her alone. I don't know but he would, if requested by Isaac, even stay until midnight; but it would do no good, and only result in making fools of all. Time flew on, and William did not come, neither did Richard ;, and Sarah began to regret that she had so unwisely refused to follow the promptings of her own heart, which seldom fail of being the most sure and safe monitor, for in its decision there seldom enter considerations of a sordid nature. When heart speaks to heart, it speaks only love, and motives are foreign to it. Motives may impel and direct it, but they spring from the mind, not the heart.    RICHARD FASCINATED.           321 Richard brooded over his unhappy lot until spring, and then he gave her up for good, and allowed himself to think no more of her. If she didn't care for him, why should he care for her? There were other young ladies, and he, from them all, might select one. He would not let all his days be clouded by sorrow because of the defection of a lady, who, like everybody else, was at liberty to do the best she could. The time for writing passed unemployed; but then there was another resource, they could wait and invite him. He would come, they knew, even at the end of a year. Sarah feared he would play the devoted to Flora, but she could get him from her, or even anybody else. She had labored so hard in trying to convince her sister and her husband that she believed William came down expressly to supplant him, and break up the match between them, in order to get him to marry his house- keeper, and William's continued absence seemed to bear her out in these arguments, that now they too began to believe that there was something in it. But what was to be done? There was nothing that could be done but to invite him; and in doing this, they would kill two birds with one stone, It would divide Richard's attention between Flora and herself, and also it might again induce William to bethink himself of his own danger. He was accordingly invited just one year fom the time of his first rejection, and Richard foolishy complied, though not without first weighing the subject carefully in his mind. He believed they had de- spaired of William, and the only way to wake him up was to make him think that Richard was going to marry Sarah, and the only way to make him think so was to invite Richard down there, and get him again interested in Sarah. Richard went down, even against the protesting monitor within; but all his old love for Sarah revived at the first touch of her hand, which thrilled through him like an electric shock. The music of her voice he again listened to in rapturous enthusiasm. He was happy again. His visits were repeated, and William was warned. His engagement was renewed, and again William was warned. He did not respond by sigh- ing, nor by any manifestation of displeasure. What could it mean P They held a council over it, and resolved that it was best to inform Bridget; and Isaac was detailed to tell her that Richard was about to marry.  Accordingly she was told, and she told William that something must be done immediately; but he blandly said, ' I guess there is no dan- ger," and he let it go. He was not going through another such a scene, even if Richard did marry her, for he wouldn't endure again what 1b. did that night if everybody in the world married.   322        LOVE ON THE WING. Richard was left undisturbed with his prize, and he began to think himself fortunate again, in not having any rivals to contend with. He looked forward in delight to the time when he would. be allowed to take her in peace whom he had so long loved. He was .again to be disappointed; for Isaac and Ellen, finding that William made no motion towards reclaiming Sarah from Richard's anxious love, grew cold towards him, and at last even uncivil. He didn't care, so long, as Sarah was good to him. He could brave their frowns so long as Sarah smiled. She was loath to turn the cold shoul- der upon him, although repeatedly urged to do so. Isaac at last became very wrathy, and threatened Richard with per- sonal violence should he persist in coming down there so much. "You might know that you are not wanted here, if you know any- thing. And if I catch you down .hre again, I'll jerk vou out of your boots." Richard replied " that he would have to make a bee, and invite him to it. He shouldn't desist coming, so long as she desired it; and he would have her, in spite of him, Locker, Jones, and Adams." "What do you know of them, you inquisitive cuss! I'll jerk you now, if you don't get out of my way, and then out of my sight, as quick as possible!"' he exclaimed, foaming with rage. Richard, thinking prudence the better part of valor, withdrew while his bones were whole; but he was surprised to see, when he came the next time, that Sarah had been won over to Isaac's side, by his con- stant blowing and bitter reproofs. The conversation used on the occa- sion we must omit on account of space. But Richard returned home, resolved not to mourn, nor write, nor ever again trouble her. He has kept his promise well, even against the most earnest solicitations of. Isaac and tlelmany agents employed to induce Richard to return again to Sarah. Richard had another now, moie constant, and not near so fickle. This was Flora, and to her he was going to devote the remain- der of his time, regardless of the entreaties of everybody. He wouldn't be buffeted around any more. Every hope was not given up of getting William, because the policy of non-intercourse, which was afterwards inaugurated, was not yet in- troduced. Every stratagem was being employed by all the parties, even during the time when they were engaged in other schemes; and Richard,while he had sagacity enough to know exactly what was re- quired of him, still his resolution was so weak, that his stronger love easily overpowered it, and led him, like a slave, to the feet of her he amost worshipped. Of course he would not permit himself to be thus duped forever.   FLORA IN THE SABBATH SCHOOL.         323 He,was invited, after the death of Flora, not only in person, but also through other means. Why they used him thus, he never troubled himself to inquire. If they wanted him, why didn't they keep him when he was to be had? He had been the butt of all. He stood be- tween two, nay, three, fires, and he received without a murmur the jeers, as well as the frowns, of all, believing and hoping that the future would yet make him whole. CHAPTER XLVII. FLORA AND THE SUNDAY SCHOOL.       MAG AND HER BROTHER. TIME   rolled on as it always does, and Flora improved it as other girls do, or, perhaps, I should have said, as other girls do not; and this would be true as regarded many of the phases in Flora's life. Other girls didn't care so much for little ragged children whom she was continually bringing to the feet of Jesus, and imbuing their young, impressive souls with His loving spirit. She is now a teacher in the Sabbath school; her fervent piety, her advanced intelligence, and her zeal in the diffusion of religious truth, recommended her to the attention of the superintendent--against the argument of her youth, which some advanced - as more competent to minister to the care of the young souls she was daily bringing into the fold than others more advanced in years, though less zealous in Chris- tian piety. Accordingly she was assigned the class, which was the largest in the school, of ragged waifs whom she had reclaimed from the paths of wickedness. She commenced faithfully, and well did she discharge her duties, uwakening in their minds an eagerness and a desire to acquire all there was to be learned, and which would have been a flattering tribute to other tmembers of the same school, could the same have been said with equal truth of them. It was in tears ofthankfulness that they received the gospel truths of a Christian religion, of which they had so long been unacquainted. It had not been denied them, but they had been neglected, their parents not caring for their moral teaching; and no one evincing any regard for their spiritual welfare, they had been al. lowd to roam the streets in untutored and almost savage negligence.   324        LOVE ON THE WING. With unwearied assiduity she applied herself to the education of these children, whom an overruling' Providence had, as it were, com- mitted to her charge. She regarded it as such; and when any one asked her why she thus degraded herself to a level with those dirty brats, from whom she never would receive a thank, she said," God has given them to me, and it is my duty to accept and Plischarge the duties with faithfulness and devotion, or else renounce the precepts of the Christian religion and one of the first .precepts of that religion is, ' Do unto them as you would that'they should do unto you.'" These children looked up to her with an affection bordering on filial love; and the meed of praise which she gave to each as the lesson was recited, sometimes with difficulty, and often inaccurately, stimulated them to renewed efforts. The pupil turned, in whispered gladness, to his next comrade, saying, "I didn't think I could do as well." They all loved her with the filial tenderness of children; and well they might, for she was doing all, and more, than many mothers could do for their children, by thus storing their minds with Christian truths, which would never be forgotten, and the influence of which would go with them through life to their graves, for the good, of not only themselves, but of all with whom they came in contact; and many of her pupils in after years remembered. in gratitude her who had done so much for them, and for which she had received only that reward which cometh from above. And many traced to this source the spring which had watered their young lives into fruitfulness, and which had pernmeated stealthily through all the strata of their character, thus softening down the harsh ahd boisterous, and polishing the jagged traits, which so prominently protrude in the undeveloped youth. All who were not acquainted with her, inquired who that young lady was who was thus wasting her energies and her youth in trying to infuse knowledge into the heads of such poor, stupid brats. They were told she was Flora Bentley, and Flora Bentley became a synonyme for goodness, purity, devotion, and love. There was none of that hau- teur which so strikingly displayed itself with ladies of her age. She was free, sociable, gentle, and kind to all; neither would she refuse to address any one whom she knew, whenever and wherever they met. And she did it, too, with such a graceful debonair style, that she seemed to have been reared in the court of princes. It was perfectly natural for her to be good, and polite, and sociable. She was not flurried nor agitated, but asked after the health of all with 4 consciousness that she had a perfect right to know; and if any, more rude than the cir. cumstances would warrant, thought differently, by returning an inso- lent reply, she blushingly bowed herself away ' but thel next time they   MARGARET STEPHENS DESCRIBED.          325 met, if not avoided, she asked the same questions, and in so loving a manner, that he, ashamed of his former rudeness, replied civilly, cour- teously, almost asking forgiveness for past offences. She never knew of offences, and never laid anything up against a living soul. These characteristics endeared her to all, and many were the invita- tions she received from neighbors and acquaintances to come and take tea with them. Her manners were so entertaining that the sick drew nourishment from her presence, and the well were cheered in hopes of the future, and encouraged to take up anew the burdens of life, and , press on over seen and unseen obstacles. Some wished her society to cheer the lonely hours of solitude, and to elevate their depressing spir- its by her liveliness, wit, and good humor. In whatever way she chose to make herself agreeable, it was most pleasant and acceptable. Her presence was sunshine, her voice was gladness, and her smile was joy. If she sat at the piano and played some of her favorite pieces, accom- panying it with her voice, all the dark clouds which before hovered around were dispelled, and the glorious sunshine again shone through the gloomy halls. There was one young lady in the village who had observed the zeal- ous devotion of Flora, her earnest love, and her abiding faith in the Christian precepts of religion, and this lady is Margaret Stephens. She is a lady of great wealth, varied accomplishments, genial manners, and a warm and loving disposition; but the most remarkable is yet to be told, and that is her wonderful beauty -far more beautiful and ra- diant than any we have yet described. She is of medium height, her features are faultless, and her complexion is neither dark nor light, but a little of both. Her hair is sunny brown, and her forehead not prominent nor receding, but of fair, moderate proportions, and her eyes of a hazel color, and so radiant that none can see without loving the possessor; her nose is small and regular; her lips - no chisel ever carved them more perfect -are of a light-red color, and they curl like Cupid's bow; her chin is small and regular, and upon her right cheek is a little dimple, which seems to heighten her exquisite beauty. Her cheeks are covered with a lightsincarnation of small patches, a little more red in some places than in others, and between them you can see the white, clear skin; these interstices fill up with red, the same as the other parts, whenever she blushes or is excited, and they come and go as the conversation is lively or flags, or as she is pleased or grieved, like the cumuli before the sun, through which, as they move rap- idly along, we see glimpses of the light between, varying always the light and the shade, according to the thickness of the cloud. 28   326        LOVE ON THE WING. The picture is complete, and before us we have the most beautifu. la!y the eyesa of man ever rested upon., She has a brother as good- looking as herself, though less lovely, who, like herself, is unmarried. Their father is dead, and they live with their widowed mother,-who is an invalid. He is gay, reckless, and dissipated, light, frivolous, and vain, while she is his opposite in everything but pride. They have been nursed in the lap of luxury and of wealth, and petted and in- dulged in everything. Every desire has been gratified, and every foi- ble overlooked. They are heirs of the immense wealth of their father, which is paid to them in instalments as they arrive at prescribed ages. The most of his, however, is given to his heirs, and in default-of them, to hers. He has already run through two' instalments; and it is pro- posed to retain the remainder for his heirs, if he has any, if it is pos- sible. This is the young gentleman, and his name is Frederick Ste- phens. Margaret felt no little anxiety for her brother; and she desired that he should select such companions-who were reserved in manners and temperate in habits, in order to curb, as much as possible, his own light, gay, and intemperate propensities. She had introduced to his notice several young ladies, whom she thought best fitted to become his wife; but they were all slighted by Fred, who thought he could make a better selection himself. He had observed Flora, and like everybody else, rather liked her; and it was with his consent that Margaret invited her to tea one after- noon. She came, and Fred was much pleased with her; but when she was asked to play and sing for them, she blushingly demurred at first, not wishing to display her musical deficiencies before such a crit- ical company. After Margaret had played two or three pieces, her modesty gave way to their earnest solicitations, and she seated herself' at the piano, and played with care and correctness several pieces she was most familiar with, and closed with a solemn ballad, much to the delight of those present. "Why, Flora, you do play and sing most beautifully!"Fred said, flatteringly, as he led her to a sofa, and seating himself beside her, awaited her reply. She blushed just perceptibly, as she answered, - "I never thought I played well; but if you are pleased with my per-  formance, I'm glad," she replied, rolling up a sheet of music, and letting it unroll again. "O, I'm delighted! Don't you think she plays elegantly, Margaret?" he asked, looking towards his sister. "Why, yes, I think she plays very well," she replied, without going into raptures.   THE PASTOR DISCUSSED.          827 "How did you like our pastor's sermon last Sabbath, Flora?" she quickly asked, not wishing to discuss further Flora's proficiency as a pianist, especially in her presence, and which she knew her brother would do if permitted. "O, I liked it ever so much; and I think he is a very good man, and also a very zealous worker in the vineyard of the Lord. He pays so much attention to the Sabbath school, that I love him very much," she replied, "But don't you think his oratory, his delivery, is most impressive?" she asked. "Yes, most assuredly I do. He is so zealous, and he labors so hard to make us understand exactly what he wishes to communicate," she replied. "But what do you think of the substance, - the sermon itself?" she asked, watching her with mingled pride and satisfaction. "O, I don't know as I ought to speak of that, for you know I'm no critic," she answered, evasively, "I did not wish you to criticise, but merely give your opinion; for there are only three of us, and we are friends," she said. "Yes; but I hardly think it becoming in us, so young, to criticise others, or pass our judgment upon-them. He is older than we are, and as our pastor, is entitled to our reverence and respect; for whatever he may lack in elegance, of diction, he more than makes up by his earnest zeal and Christian piety," she replied, reluctantly. "There, Fred, don't ydh wish you had gone; for I told you you would like him, as everybody else does," she said, turning her attention to her brother, who was so much interested in Flora's replies, that he had not said anything. "Well, I am very sorry now I did not go, but I will go after this every Sabbath, just because Flora does," he said, looking down upon her most lovingly; and Flora, to avoid a too close a scrutiny, held the roll of music up to her face, thus concealing all the lower portion. "I thought many of his illustrations very fine; and the resemblance between the picture drawn, and the subject, appeared to me apt and true," Margaret said. "Yes, he abounds in similes," Flora said.  "I never liked that style so well as the straightforward, narrating one, sparkling with sound sense, and deep logic, such as Mr. Mandel's," Fred said, more critically. "O, fiddlesticks, Fred! you are always on the contrary side. Mr. Mandel had many admirers, I admit, but they were of the better in.   328        LOVE ON THE WING. formed portion of the society, who loved his beautiful, flowery style; while Mr. - , though not so precise and ornate, is more of a pastor, because he deals more in commonplace events, which the comprehen- sion of every one cannot fail to understand," Margaret said, excitedly. "Yes, my dear, you have said it exactly. That is the reason why I liked Mr. Mandel so much. He talks as-if his auditors were not fools, butwere prepared to grasp all he presented to them. Mr. -- does very well; he is zealous, and I commend him for it; but when you say that he preaches in the style of other modern divines, I must respect- fully dissent. Before a Sabbath-school, Mr. -- is the man; but be- fore an intelligent, fashionable, Christian audience, he is far in the- shade," Fred said, languidly. "Fashionable audience! Indeed, Fred, you wrong us much by ap- plying that word. We make no such pretensions. True, we dress according to the latest style, in order not to be outlandish, npr behind our city sisters. How would it look for us to disregard this, and appear in some garb fifty years behind the times?" she said, pettishy, while both looked at Fred, in mingled pity and love, "There, you see, is where we respectfully differ. I approve of a better style of delivery, or rather a style that is more in keeping with the intelligence of modern tastes and requirements, while you rather dress fashionably, and sit listening to a sermon, which a hundred years ago would have been very appropriate, and not beyond the limited capac- ities of the hearers," he said, warming up quite eloquently. "The requirements of the soul are of more importance than the mere gratification of a fastidious taste. Mr. -'s sermons are food for the hungry soul, and they nourish and strengthen all the: activities of life, making us more strong and healthful, both in body and soul; while Mr. Mandel went into generalities, and in a fine, beautifully-spun discourse, tickled the ear, and pleased the imagination, without touching the heart," she said; smiling at Fred's embarrassment. "I hardly agree with you in your conclusions; for it is not- impossi- ble to gratify the taste, or, as you say, imagination, and at the same time instruct the heart. There is Henry Ward Beecher, for 'instance, than whom no divine of to-day appeals more strongly to the heart, and all the delicate Christian impulses of our nature, and, at the same time, in language deep, and profound, and flowery. At times his lan- guage, like Mr. --'s, is commonplace and simple, and then in a few moments he rises into sublimity, and touches with an easy grace the metaphysical problems; of the day, and then back again to a more hum- ble sphere. That is the kind of preaching for me. Give me a sermon   FLORA AS MUSIC-TEACHER.          329 that is not only instructive, but entertaining. But I am going to church, and will willingly be bored with his sermons. I shall attend Sabbath school also, and enlist under Flora's banner, and be one of her pupils," he said, looking lovinglytat Flora, who blushed at being thus compli- mented by one so far above her in the walks of life. "I am afraid you will find me a rather poor teacher; but it will be my first duty to get you to love Mr. , who, I am persuaded, merits it from all. He is so patient and forbearing, that all look up to him with love and reverence," she replied, returning coyly, his admiring look. "I will love him, if you wish me to, and do anything in the wide world that will please you. If this is all, I am much gratified to think the conditions no harder," he returned, much pleased. "What do you think, Fred, of engaging Miss Bentley-as music- teacher and governess for our little sisters?" she asked, looking kindly at Fred, then at Flora, who blushingly interposed an objection, on ac- count of her youth and unskilfulness. "It is capital. I wonder you did not think of it before, and then I can recite -my Sabbath school lessons before I go. Invite her by all means, and pay her well, too. Let me see: twelve dollars a week would not be too much, would it?"he asked, looking anxiously towards his sister. "It is not so much as some music-teachers get; still, if Flora is will- ing to accept it, we would be much pleased. What do you think, Flora?will you undertake it?"Margaret asked, looking hopefully. I don't know, I'll see; but I rather like'it, as I shall be earning my own living, and not be a burden upon my kind friends and relatives, who have already done for me more than I can hope to return. I have long thought of engaging in something which would wholly or' in part' pay my expenses, and the offer you have been so kind as to make me is so liberal, that it will be more than sufficient to defray my current ex- penses," she replied, as her eyes lighted up with the prospect of not only earning her own living, but also relieving others of the burden of her care. "You must come here and live with us, and be a sister to us, and so long as you wish to remain you shall have a home, with good. remu- nerative wages," Margaret said, much encouraged at the prospect. "You need not be frightened, Miss Bentley; as your work will not be very hard, for all the time you need to spend each day with your pupils will be about two hours," Fred said, as he observed a shade of dread pass over Flora's face. 28*   330        LOVE ON THE WING. O, I don't fear the work at all; that I will gladly do: but I'm afraid my sister and friends will oppose it, thinking me rash in attempting to take care of myself," she said, diffidently. "O, well, you can assure them you are going to not only a good place, but also a profitable one, where you will be as well provided for, and taken care of, as you would be anywhere," Margaret continued, encouragingly. "Well, if I come, I will try and be ready by nest Monday. Will that be soon enough?P she asked, rising. "O, yes, any time most convenient to you, though I hope it will be as early as possible," Fred rejoined, and rising, sauntered leisurely towards the window. "What is-your hurry, Miss Bentley? It is not late. See! the sun is very high. Wait, and Fred will be your chaperon home, will you not, Fred?" she asked, pleadingly. "Certainly, and wit} the greatest pleasure, if Miss Bentley will ac- cept," he said, looking towards Flora, who was arranging the music upon the piano. "You are very kind, indeed," she replied, casting a hurried, retreat- ing glance towards Fred. "I shall consider myself more than repaid for all the trouble, by the pleasure which I shall receive from your companionship; indeed, it will be not only pleasurable, but profitable, for while you entertain, you also instruct." She sat down at the piano, and drummed listlessly the ivory keys, thinking the while of the probable results of the step she was about to take. She rather thought a strong opposition would be raised against leaving her comfortable home, where everything she de- sired was had, and where lingered the remnants of what was once a loved home. These, with all their dear associations, she must leave, temporarily perhaps, but still, if she left it, she would leave it sorrow- ing, not only because it was her home, but because it was the h'noe her mother had provided for her. Flora is now eighteen years of age, and as pretty as a morning flower full-blown. Her cheeks were flushed with crimson, while her eyes were of a deep blue, and reflected the peaceful serenity of her soul-the calm, deep, earnest love of her nature. Fred escorted Flora to the gate of her house, and taking her hand in his, pressed it to his lips; then, urging her not to delay coming longer than was necessary, retraced his steps homeward. He was much pleased with Flora, and he anticipated a happy time when she was   RICHARD ATTENTIVE TO FLORA.         331 finally settled in his home, where he could have her continually in his society, and he prearranged the hours he would be able to spend with her as he returned. CHAPTER XLVIII. RICHARD AND FLORA. D  ICHARD had of late been more than usually attentive to Flora, obliging her by many little acts, and by speaking so gently as to attract her attention. His pleasant look and winning smile often dis- concerted her, who, though susceptible of it, had not yet learned to love, as she was willing, and as she thought, she must. Not one word had been said on the subject, and as time passed along, she began to think it nothing but his usual manner; still there was something, an un- definable feeling in her heart, that told her she was beloved, though she was not fully persuaded. What could such looks, and words, and smiles mean, if not love?He didn't speak so gently, nor snile so sweetly, upon others; and when she tipped over his ink on the desk, papers, and other articles, he didn't frown nor scold, but said, "it was no matter; only a bottle of ink, worth ten cents." When he assisted her on to her horse, he was so careful that she even felt afraid; and if she sprang off on to the horseblock before he ar- rived there, he cautioned her against doing so, for fear the horse might sheer out, and drop her in the wrong place, perhaps under his feet. He would not permit her to step into the boat, unless he had hold of her hand, for she might slip in, and take cold. He was so particular to have her put on her rubbers whenever the ground was a little wet; and when she had a sick headache, he came in to inquire if he should go for the doctor. When he was told that it was nothing but a headache, he evinced no further anxiety for about fifteen minutes, when he had to go in again, and sit by the sofa fanning her, inquiring often if she felt better. These little incidents Flora thought of that night, as she lay and tossed upon a sleepless pillow. If he had only said one word, she need not have doubted; but now she knew nothing, and she could not pre- sume on his affections without more proof. If she had known posi- tively what were Richards intentions, she would not have encouraged   332        LOVE ON TH1w   WING. the hope that she would accept the position of governess ; but of these she knew nothing, and she had acted as if there was not the least proba- bility of Richard's love. No one expected she was going to make it her home always, and so she accepted the first favorable opportunity that presented itself to-cut herself from it, and launch out into the broad world, determined to earn an honest living, and not be the recipient of charity longer than was necessary. She had thought of taking some such step for about a year, but what she would do, or where commence, she had not yet fully persuaded her- self, and the friendly offer the Stephens's had made settled the subject decidedly. She would go. She might as well commence now as any time, for she couldn't live so, neither whuld she. Others mitght st in- active, and consume the substance of. their friends, but she would never do it if she was able to work. She rose earlier the next morning than usual, and commenced pick- ing up a few small articles, which she placed in the satchel she intended to carry on her arm. Helen looked out from her half-opened eyes, and wondered what she could be about so early in the morn- ing. "You had better come back to bed again, and wait till morning, before you bein to stir around, and wake up the whole house," Helen said, pettishy, and turning over, tried to sleep till morning. "I'm sorry if I disturbed you. But, hark! the robins are singing, and light is beginning to illumine the east," Flora replied, resuming again the work from which she had been diverted. She had gathered up all her little things, and had brought out tht- old hair trunk which had been her mother's, and into it she packed her dresses, and furs, and books, and drawing materials, and then closing it, descended to the garden. Everything was still around, save the trilling of the robins, perched on some topmost bough, or the wren, as it chirped from bough to bough near the kitchen door. The sounds were familiar; and as she thought, that perhaps, she was hearing them fir the last time, in that place, a tear glistened in her eye, and moistened the long, curling lashes, till they drooped languidly down on her pale cheeks. She strolled down to the beach, and saw the rippling. waves roll themselves up at her feet. The boat lay moored to the wharf, and as it oscillated to and fro with every little wave, it reminded her of the many happy hours she had spent in it; and she looked upon the spot where she had sat, and wondered if she would ever sit there again. Perhaps Richard would be willing to take'htr 'out when she was gone. His many kindnesses again recurred to her, and she sat down upon   FLORA'S RESOLVE.           33 the edge of the wharf, and burying her face in her lap, sobbed, as she thought how happy she had been. The smoke was ascending from some of the chimneys in graceful curls towards the heavens. The bells from neighboring factories were announcing the hour of rising, ardd all nature seemed rousing itself from its refreshing slumbers, and was girding on the activities of life. The breeze murmured gently through the leafy boughs, making one remember the scenes of the past, when all nature was thus enlivened, when happy thoughts aid pleasant associations, when ambitious hopes, unalloyed with a tinge of bitterness, crowded themselves upon the mind. The past, with -its joys 'and sorrows, was gone,--gone, and never to be reclaimed. "The past--that unfathomable ocean, into which the river of time is insensibly gliding. The past, that un- searchable abyss, from which we vainly endeavor to snatch the perisha- ble idols of our hearts' secret worship. The past, that mysterious vortex, which has swallowed up all we have been, thought, felt, acted, or endured, and froml which it is no less impossible to recover a fallen kingdom or a ruined world, than a faded rose leaf or an idle thought." She rose, and bathing her feverisli temples in the clear cold water, to obliterate the trace of sorrow, she tripped gayly towxards the house. She met Richard on the stoop, washing, whom she tried to avoid, with out being observed too closely; but her manner awakened his curiosity the more, and as she approached nearer, he said, "Good morning, Flo- ry; you are up ekrly this morning. Why, what is the matterP You look sad and sorrowful," he asked, much agitated, as he observed more closely her face. "O, nothing. I've only been down to the shore of the lake; and as the thoughts of the past came crowding upon me, I felt sad; that's all," she replied, trying to appear cheerful. "Why, that shouldn't make you feel so bad, I shouldn't think, unless you've been thinking of Eddie and mother. But never mind, Flory, we have to bear with the trials, that we may enjoy more the pleasures of life. Come, cheer up; you can't guess what I've purchased for you," he said, encouragingly. "O, Richard, please don't say you've bought anything for me, for it will make me feel ten times worse," she pleadingly remonstrated. "Why, I thought you would be very much plleased with them, and I took every pains to. select the best, and had your name engraved on them, as presented from lme. What do you think they are?" ' O, I'm so sorry. I wish I had known of this before. Why didn't   334   .     LOVE ON THE WING. you tell re?" she aked, looking up at him through eyes misty with unshed tears, as he wiped his hands and face upon the towel. "Why, I thought I would wait until you were of age, when you would know better your own feelings. I have purchased you a hand- some gold watch and chain, with pencil and two lockets attached, and -and -and a   a-ring. Come in, and see if it will fit your little finger. There is the ring, and here is the watch. See! there's your name. It does fit nicely, don't it? There, keep it, and wear it forever. In one of the lockets is a picture df the giver, and in the other put your own, and wear them when you go to Sabbath school." O, dear Richard, you are very kind, and I do not deserve it from you, for I fear I've done that which you'll disapprove. I have promised to go to Mr. Stephens's and teach his sisters music, and whatever duties they may wish to impose. I'm going Monday." "Why, Flora! I should have thought you would have consulted mother before taking such, an important step," h6 said, in astonish- ment. "I didn't think it was necessary i and as I am of age, it could hardly be expected that I would remain longer an expense to my uncles, and a care to those who have been so kind to me when I most needed their help; but now they, and of course everybody else, will expect that I'll do something {for myself. I accept thankfully the presents you are so kind to give, and I shall wear them always in remembrance of you," she replied,' her voice betokening the repressed emotions of her heart. "O, Flora! you do not really think of going, do you? I had hoped you would remain here, until you determined, or settled yourself perma- nently, in your future home. Or do you propose to remain there only until you finish the task you have so inconsiderately undertaken?" he asked, regarding her with increased anxiety. "I do most certainly intend going; and when I finish there, I shall find a boarding-house, and there make my home. I don't think any young lady, in my circumstances, justified in sitting idly down, while others toil for her support," she said, proudly. "You will have to pay your board elsewhere the same as it is paid here, and they will toil who prepare your meals, the same as here, so what is the difference?" he asked. "The difference is, I pay for it with my own money, and it is earned i by honest labor," she replied. "I wish you would give up this foolish notion, and return to reason,   RICHARD OPPOSES FLORA'S PLAN.        335 and the quiet, peaceful pursuits of life. When you marry, it will be plen- ty time to settleayourself to downright hard work; but, until then, live happily as possible. Do not bow yourself down with hard work so young, for it would shorten your years a score. It is bad enough to work of necessity, without doing it voluntarily. If I was sure of such a life, do you think I would run off, and plunge into the life of a slave? No. You are but shifting from the frying-pan into the fire. You are making your condition far worse than it is now. Consider and retract; then return to your old life and boon companions," he continued. "The very course you would have me pursue would totally unfit me for the stern realities of life, and it would be much more difficult to conform myself to the rough hardships of necessitous toil than if I had accustomed myself to it from the beginnirg, for the pleasure of it. Better begin by hard work, and end, in leisure, peace, and happiness, than it is to begin a life in indolence, and end in need and privation. How much more easily can I work now, than when I am bent down with age, and enfeebled by the infirmities of life! -Resolve yourself which. is the most proper course to pursue - yours of listless inactivity, or mine of work," she said, her eyes gleaming with proud satisfaction. "You are braye and heroic, but I fear you overrate your powers of endurance. Think of your fragile constitution, to endure the hardship which your more wilful mind seeks to impose. If your body were as strong as your mind, you could do anything; but your stubborn will and your ambitious soul are not only running away with your body, but also with your better intelligence. Your mind, spureedcon by pride and ambition, is plunging you into all the more objectionable features of life, without reaping any of the advantages. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. You have a home now, and you may not, if you persist in your insane resolution, get another so pleasant and agreeable. Pluck the flowers as you go, hoping and believing they will always spring up and bloom in your path, without going into danger- ous and unknown morasses, to seek what, perhaps, is not there, but where you 'may find instead a fatigued body, a desponding spirit, or a poisonous reptile, the influence of which may sink you into the grave. But if you dre resolved to go, go ahead; and when you have finished there,.return here, and it shall be your home, paying for your board the highest price, out of your hard-earned wages," he said, frown- ingly. "With this as my home I shall be as well pleased as with that of any other, and I may be compelled to avail myself of the offer you have thus kindly made; but it is on the condition that payment is   336        LOVE ON THE WING. receivedfrom me for my support. Is the contract so understood?" he asked, delighted at this turn of the conversation. "No, you crazy girl! I didn't mean any such thing, and only said it to see if you were in earnest. Say, mother, this girl is crazy, and is going to run away," he said, going to the door and calling to his moth- er, who was busy over the stove getting breakfast. "Going to run away! Why, where is she going, pray? she asked, coming in with a fork and spoon in her hand. "Why, going to work for her living, at Mr. Stephens's, where she will have to work from morning to night, either in the kitchen scrubbing the floor, or teaching their little contrary, wilful brats music, not yet old enough to spell the monosyllables; and when she has nothing else to do she is to take them out for an airing, or what is worse still, mend their clothes," he said, out of breath with excitement. " , no, it ain't near so bad as that. All I have to do is to teach the children music, and the common rudiments of an education, and for this I'm to receive twelve dollars per week; which I think is far bet- ter than to sit still and consume that amount, and earn nothing," she said. ". They only pretend this to get her away from here; when ty get you there, they will make you earn the money," he said, booking towards his mother for encouragement. "Well, if she wants to go, let her try it; and if she don't like it, she can come back again. The doors are always open,whether she has money to pay or not," she said, turning hastily to look at the meat, which was burning. "There, you see, your mother is the wisest yet. She knows it won't hurt me to work, and do something for myself," she said, her eyes brightening with assured hopes of success. Richard, at this unexpected turn of affairs, looked crestfallen and sad; but he never allowed himself to say anything against his moth- er's judgment, still his conscience rebelled in this case, for he thought his mother might have decided inconsiderately; yet he said, "Well, we'll see," FThis was on Friday, during all of which, and the day following, he remained about the house, or would not be gone but a little while to the post-office, whtn he would return, sit in the house a few moments, and then stroll out into the garden and down to. the lake. Here he spent most of his time, listening beneath the over-hanging shade of drooping vines to the rippling of the tiny waves as they dashed them- selves upon the sandy beach. The music of the lulling sound seemed   to soothe his restless spirit, and his curiosity was at times awakened to see if any of the little waves reached higher up the sandy beach than their predecessors. Every wave, as he saw it nearing the shore, looked larger, and seemed to roll with increasing strength, as if it would smother the tiny waves before it, but it ended like all the rest, and reached no farther up than the footprints of those that had gone be- fore. He could find no rest or contentment anywhere. His face was pale, and his eyes were red, and he looked the very picture of despair. He spoke to no one, except in short sentences, and these were full of bit- terness. If be smiled at nature, or at the drollery of those around, it was unearthly, unnatural, and froze ere it was half formed. His mother wondered what ailed him, and twice she ventured to inquire; but his replies and looks convinced her that whatever sorrow he had, it was his own. None could feel, none could sympathize with him; Helen's liveliness and sprightliness seemed most to please him; but the smile she essayed to produce only flickered like a dim light beneath a dark and lowering cloud, like stars which shine but faintly through a murky atmosphere. He met Flora in her usual round of duties, and she, unconscious of having produced this change, asked him why he felt so sad. "O, Flora! do you ask me why? Why does the pigeon, when pierced by the shot of the huntsman, fall fluttering to the ground?" he replied, turning his dimmed eyes upon her pitying face. "Why? because it is wounded, and cannot fly," she replied, pleas- antly, wondering-how he would apply such a comparison to himself. "Wall, that is just my case exactly. You are the huntsman, who have wounded me terribly with a cruel shaft from your bow. If you would not leave me, I think I shall again be happy; but your persist- ence in the course you have resolved will drive me to the verge of destruction. Flora, you are leaving home, and throwing yourself upon the charity of the world, where all is cold and desolate. You may live to regret the course you are pursuing; but when kind friends intercede and implore you to desist, reflect. Think they have your good at heart, and wish you well. Our actions are often governed 'by circumstances, and if our motives are sometimes selfish, they are, for all that, no less pure. It is selfish in me to wish you here, and envious for me to see you elsewhere; still I can't help it; it is nature, implanted for wise and holy purposes ; and if I do but obey its promptings, I but conform to the requirements of my being. You are sustained only by pride and 29 o    338        LOVE ON THE WING. ambition; and what are these? They are the whims of an idle hour. One is, that we may appear well before our fellows; and the other is, that we may get above them. We are mortal, from dust taken, and to dust shall return: all equal and alike. The present is for us; make it useful to our happiness, - this is the sum of all our endeavors, - and leave the rest to fools, and those insane," he concluded, without a ray of hope. '"Your words would do if we were sure of the future; and until we have that assurance, we should strive with all our might and main to render the evening of our days as happy as the morning; for we are always judged by our'end: and if this be happy, our lives have been nobly spent; but if it ends in privation and distress, then all our knowledge of men and of the affairs of the world has been ignorance, and our actions folly. Better far to commence toiling, and end in rest, than to commence in indolence, and end in sorrow," she gayly replied. "What motives do you think the Stephenses have in offering you this inducement? simply the education of their sisters, whom they could teach all they are able to learn for nothing? Believe me, there are latent springs working at this, and you would do well to think much and ponder deeply," he said, reflectively. ' Why, what injury can befall me? You speak as if some dark and dangerous plot were threatening me. What is it? tell me, and if real, I will give up," she said, eagerly. "Why, you simple girl, have you not thought that it might be de ir- able to marry you to Fred. Stephens, that wild, reckless, dissipated man, with whom not one moment's peace would you 'ever enjoy, not one ray of hope would ever pierce the thick sombre curtains of his palatial home. Think you that no danger and is it not a threatening one? If I were you, 1 would sooner put my head into the very jaws of death; for what you are doing - if it should eventually occur-- would be worse than ten thousand deaths! A life spent in such companionship, and be compelled forever to endure it, without respite, is worse than no life at all. If you were a daughter of mine, I would rather see you coffined for the tomb than see you linked to such a fate. Do not let such gaudy splendors dazzle you; they captivate the senses, but do not let them carry away your better judgment. Within those gilded walls of wealth and luxury, there often lurks a hidden foe that destroys the peace, that blasts the hope, and undermines the health of those who fool- ishy think that if, once they were ensconced beneath that roof, their heart's desire would be gratified. How many lives have been thus blasted i i the vain desire to find that which is not there! Happiness, and peace,   THE STEPiIENS'S EULOGIZED.        339 and contentment never reign in such places. Hope is withered ere it escape from the expanding bud, when once it is exposed to the bleak, cold atmosphere of such a place. Here you have been happy, and the home is humble; thereyou will be miserable should you wed the heir, and in a home of affluence. If he were a quiet, modest, and tem- perate man, who, in prosperity, would not be arrogant, nor in adversity despondent, against him I could say nothing, whether rich or poor; for if such live poor, - and I hardly think they would - they will be no shame to their station'; and if rich, they would he not only honorable, but also exemplary citizens," he said, sorrowfully. "I don't know much of him; but she is a perfect lady; so good, so gentle, so loving, and so kind, that my heart melted to tenderness the moment I saw her and heard her speak. You would alaost be willing to sacrifice yourself that she might be happy. You couldn't be dis- pleased with her; and if you knew her, you would retract much you have said against wealth, or else I'm no judge of the human heart. You couldn't be unhappy in her presence. Her smile is sunshine, her words are love, and her presence perfect bliss. He is a fine looking young man, and appears a polished gentleman. His manners are polite and affable, an his disposition is gentle. About his habits I know nothing; by what I have seen of him, I should pronounce him the very opposite of what you have represented. I only judge from appear- ances; and no signs of dissipation are visible. I wish, however, you was mistaken, or had overdrawn the objectionable features of his char- acter," she said, with a lowering voice, while her cheeks slightly col- ored.      , "'What, girl! do you love him already? I suspected as much. Then you are lost! and H what? Ah, me!" he sighed, and bowed his face upon his hands, and moaned deeply, yet said nothing. She looked. on, and wondered why he felt so. Could he regret so feelingly her ab- sence, or was it because he feared she would be unhappy? In either case, he had her welfare at heart. She glided noiselessly from the room, and sought her own, where she had spent so many happy hours, and which now seemed dearer to her than ever before. She sat down by the window, before which she had read so many evenings, and as she looked out upon the busy world, anrd heard the familiar sounds, and saw the familiar sights, she bowed her head upon the sill and sighed. She sighed for the home she was leaving, where not one unkind word had been spoken toier, and where she had known no other than a joy- ous, happy life. This she was leaving, to find an equal or a better one, in the home of strangers. Would sunshine ever again cross her   340 L-OVE ON THE WING. path should she go? or would happiness ever again bless her? These were questions which the future alone could solve, and she was then preparing to launch forth, in the eager expectancy that it would be solved to her satisfaction. If she only knew why Richard felt so sad, and why he objected so strongly to the course she was taking, she would feel more courage to commence and endure the trials .of life; but this she did not know. Richard had been as kind and as good to her as a brother, and as such she loved him. She had not thought it possible to love him more, nor differently, and his love for her'had been broth- erly and kind. This was all: still she could not regard the home she had, the same as if it had been her mother's, nor Richard quite the same as if he had been truly a brother, though she loved him as such. Sunday came, with its usual round of duties; but she never prepared her toilet with so much care, while her heart beat so heavily within. Ladies generally feel pretty light and gay when they put on, for the first time, the golden chain, with the ticking repeater attached; not so with her, for as she stood before the mirror, though they became her, still she felt sad, and a desponding cloud seemed to overshadow her. She would appear gay, however, if she didn't feel it; so she came trip- ping down the stairs, and swept gracefully into the room, affecting the style of the flirt. Richard sat there, and for once did smile, though not a free, open smile, without a taint of bitterness beneath; it was like a smile that comes and goes for form's sake, without leaving a trace of joy behind. Her scholars observed) that though she looked so pretty and gay, she felt sad; and more than one of them asked her why she felt so bad. Had her prayers not been answered? They prayed for her last night before going to bed, and they knew God would certainly take care of her, for she had been so good and kind to them. Little Johnny Young kneeled down in the pew, and said, in whispers, and between his sobs,-     / "O, good Lord! bless Miss Flora. She has been so good to us, to take us from our sinful ways, and bring us here, and show us Him that died on a hill, that we might love Him, and go to that good place made for little boys like me who love Him. I do love you, O, good Lord! and I do love Miss Flora, for she has been so good to me. She gave me some new close to wear here, that IS might be spectable like the rest. Hear me, good Lord, to day; and drive away the ugly, dark clouds from Miss Flora's face. She allus look so purty afore to-day and I dunno what it is that makes her look so bad. I didn't say my verses so good- to-day; but she never care, nor say cross words, as * ,  v              b;   RICHARD MELANCHOLY.           341 mamma does sometimes. I wish mamma was so good, I'd be better boy, and learn my verses all by heart. O, Lord! please bless Miss Flora, and I'll have my lesson better next time. Amen." While this little, simpre, heartfelt petition was being offered up to the throne of the living God, Flora bowed her head in humbleness of awe, and listened intently to the prattling, prayerful words of innocent youth; and as he rose from his knees, she looked at him, her face wet with tears, and drawing the little fellow closer to her, kissed him fondly, thinking the while that one such moment spent there, was more se- renely happy, and more free from any alloy, than all the happiness one would gain in a lifetime of secular pursuits. To think her sorrow was a subject worthy this little boy's attention, and then to hear him plead with God to lighten that sorrow, and make her happy, was too much for her gentle, loving heart to endure without melting in love for the boy, and in gratitude to Him who had permitted herself to be the ser- vant for the reclamation of such souls from wickedness, and then to be the recipient of his tender love, and the subject of his prayers to God. What earthly joy could be more perfect? And this was her reward, while she thought herself the debtor. Sabbath closed at last, ahd evening came; and as the weather was a little coolish, a fire was kindled in the parlor, and here all the members of the household gathered. Richard sat in one corner with a book, and appeared at times to be greatly absorbed with it; and then at other times his eyes left the book, and either looked into vacancy, or at the light. His mother and Helen did the principal talking, while Flora occasionally put in a proposition for discussion, or assented to some statement. In this manner the short evening glided swiftly away, and presently all withdrew except Richard, who still' sat dreamily brooding over his sorrows. He had not spoken a word during the evening, and Flora thought she would go and see if she couldn't say something to lighten his grief. She really pitied him, for he looked so white she didn't know but something serious would result. She came, and taking a seat, sat down just opposite him, 'vith the stove between, and said, - "Richard, why are you so dreadful 'sad?Why, goodness I it will run you into the typhoid fever if you don't cheer up and be happy," she said, looking at him in mingled pity and love. "  Well, I wouldn't be so much of a loss as that which I am now al. ready suffering," he replied, looking more like a spectre than a living man. Why, you almost frighten me, you look so dreadful bad. I didn't 29  -------;--. ,                -   g34        LOVE ON THE WING. know you had suffered any loss of late. Please tell me, and I, by tak- ing a part of the sorrow, will lessen yours," she said, pleasantly. "Sit around here in front of the stove, and I'll tell you all, for I don't like to talk to any one so far away." She moved round to the corner, within a short distance of him, and then said,- "Come, now, I'm not deaf, nor are you so very weak that you can't speak above a whisper," she said, banteringly. Thus encouraged, Rich- ard commenced, by moving his chair close up to hers, while she only blushed, and he said, - , A few years ago I saw a young lady, with sunny hair, like yours, and eyes of a deep blue, like yours- " Is she dead " she asked, in alarm. "No: but wait; perhaps she better be. / I loved this lady, I thought then, but now it seems so foolish when I lbok back, that I am almost persuaded that I didn't. But I loved her then; and after we were en- gaged some time, and were just about to be married, an evilstar arose, in the form of a rivallover, and who, because of his wealth, succeededin sup- planting me in her affections. I was rejected, coldly and scornfully, and told never to darken her doors again, or speak, or write to her a word of love; both these promises I have kept, and always shall. It wasn't but a little while after this your mother died, and you came here; then I thought you in time would grow up to be a lady, and, as you looked much like her, might fill the place which my rival prevented her from occupying. But nowyqu are going to -tear yourself away, and open fresh the wound which just now was closing up in love for you. Will you fil her place, Flora, and be mine?" he asked, as a ray of hope shot across his face. "Richard! I hadn't thougt of such a thing; indeed, I hadn't. It is so sudden that it bewilders me, and I'm at a loss what to answxer. Let me think of it till morning, and then, before I go, I will say defi- nitely," she said. Before you go! And do you intend to go, whetherornot?" he asked,'as the smile darkened into a frown. "Why, I may as well go and stay till fall, for I promised them I would come Monday; and it won't make any difference where I am for a few months," she replied. "No, not if that Fred don't get you away. I have had such bad luck, that I think it almost impossible for me to get a wife," he said, taking her hand, and pressing it reverently to his lips, while she turned away her head and blushed; which he, observing, again said,- "You might as well say now, Flora, and then I can sleep so much   RICHARD PLEADS HS CAUSE.         343 better to-night, in the consciousness that you will one day be mine. Come, Flora, say yes," he said, pleadingly. "O, I would rather think of it to-night, for it comes so sudden, and it is such an important step, that I fear to take it without due deliber- ation. If I had thought of it before, why, I could answer one way or the other; but you see I haven't. I have only felt a brotherly love; but this is so different and so strange that I wish to see, and ask my- self if I can love you, as a lover should," she replied, evading his caresses. "But, my dear girl, you can, if you would, answer now; for it don't take long to communicate with the heart, especially on such a subject as this; and if you chose, you could give me an answer now, one way or the other. I never can see why ladies desire to defer so long and indefinitely their decisions; for my part, I could answer such a question on the spot, and it would be right; and I would abide, in confident as- surance, the result of that decision. If I ask you a question on any other subject, you answer it immediately; nor do you desire to defer the time of replying. Your mind, obeying the dictates of the heart, resolves on the reply that it will give, and that is the same at one time as at another; unless, indeed, there are considerations to be taken into account at some future time, which may compel you to accept or reject, without any further thought. Come, Flora, throw aside this dalliatory spirit, and decide at once just as you feel. As you feel now in regard to the answer to be made, so you ought to-morrow or next day. Time should not make any difference in the decision. I am afraid, if I let you go without an affirmative reply, that Fred will entice you away. Flora, if you can't love me, pity me. I hardly expected you would; yet how extremely happy I should deem myself, could I be assured, be- fore I sleep, that you will one day, even if remote, be mine. * It is more blessed to give than to receive;' and you can grant me great hap- piness with one littleyword that costs nothing. Could I make you as happy as you can me, would I delay? No; I would be happy in see- ing you rejoice. But, no, you care nothing for me, else you would not delay another moment, in view of the sorrow that delay will cause me. You can answer now as well as to-morrow, and that answer will be the same now that it will be to-morrow. One night would surely not make any difference," he said, and bowing his. head on his hand, awaited her reply. "Yes, we can answer all questions on the spot, but we must abide their consequences ; and this is so very important that it certainly de; mands more than an ordinary passing notice. It is for life Tand a false   344        LOVE ON THE WING. step taken now may entail future sorrow upon us both; consequently, not only is my welfare concerned, but also yours, and if you take a right view of the subject, you would not only commend me for wishing to delay, but would refrain from urging further a decision, which every one knows, should not be given thoughtlessly, "Well, if you are determined not to answer to-night, I suppose it will be useless to press further the subject. But say, you will permit me to take the betrothal kiss, in the hope that your answer will be in the affirmative?" he asked, drawing near, and putting his arm gently around Flora's neck, was. about to take what had not been granted, when she drew back, saying, pleasantly, "I might as well say yes, as permit that, for it's only a different way of saying yes, which I rather would be deferred till morning." "Well, then, let it go till morning; but don't forget that I am to receive an answer in the morning. I'll try and think you will say yes, so good night,". he said, rising mechanically. She said "good night," and they both retired to their respective rooms. l  CHAPTER XLIX. ISAAC TELLS OF itORDMAN'S FAILURE. "HERE, I told you some time ago that Thomas would break I  down, and so he has-has failed to the tune of twenty-five thousand, and has sent down to William for help," Isaac said, hur- riedly, on coming into the house one day where he found a gay com- pany of his relatives assembled. "Why, Im surprised to hear such bad news of Thomas, who was always such a clever-hearted fellow!"Emma said, looking up as- tonished. s0, well, it is serving them just right for being so hateful," Sarah said, delighted. "It don't look hardly right to rejoice in one another's fall, even if they have opposed our wishes," Emma said, chidingly. "It may be easy for some to forgive, but for me to forgive the wrong and injustice they have done me, I never will. I, to-day, if they broke down as poor as Job's turkey, would kick them from the door - the proud things. I suppose they thought they could swell, and dash around   ENVIOUS CRITICISMS.          345 for nothing; it costs other folks' money to keep up such style. Served them right; I wish they would break down poorer still. I want to see the whole family down here at work for William, then I'll be satisfied,"t Sarah said, angrily. O, Sarah, I wouldn't say so, for you are only returning evil for evil, whereas you should return good for evil," Ellen said, as a frowning smile passed across her face. "Yes, you smile as if you blamed me, while your words only touch the ear. But they wxill do very well to inculcate as precepts, though I hardly think they will do for every day. They look very well in. a story, or in the Bible; but give me the eye-for-an-eye doctrine. If a person uses you mean, retoit, and let him know you have spunk enough to resent a bare-faced, down-right injury; and if you don't manifest such a spirit, he would go on and on till he crowded you off into the sea. That is the only way -do as you are done by. It's my doctrine, and I'm going to follow it out to the bitter end. These soft, tender, chick- en-hearted folks I don't like, and they never amount to anything," she replied, haughtily. "I think just like that myself, and I applaud Sarah for such a mani- festation of her spirit. I think she has been far too lenient already towards them all; though I suppose family pride forbids going into court. That would be the only way to fix such recreants," Sophie said, glancing round upon the assembled group for approval, "I am glad I have one unequivocal supporter. They are the kind to have in such times as these. I like a person to stand right up, and fearlessly take a position, and maintain it, regardless of consequences; neither do I care on which side he is, whether right or wrong; if he thinks he is right, it is enough, and every one. will respect the sincerity of his intentions," Sarah said, smiling a bitter-sweet smile. "O, well, it's all plain enough to my mind. She wishes to make such a splurge In the world as to astonish all the ret, and yet she hasn't the means to carry it out; for Thomas, or indeed any man with less than a half a million, would not be able to supply her inordinate demands upon his purse, consequently they must either fail or give up their expensive style of living. Only think, two thousand dollars a year for dress just for herself, say nothing of her children, and they must require a thou- sand more. The bank account must be pretty good to stand that pres- sure, and I'm confident that Thomas can't long maintain it; and I have my doubts about William himself being able to supply all her require- ments for a very long time," Ellen said, in a tone of mixed joy and irony. "She didn't really want to see any ill happen to them, still she   346        LOVE ON TIlE WING. couldn't see how it could be avoided so long as she had her own way, and she pursued such a ruinous course. A prudent wife will see how far she can go by the drift of circumstances, and beyond that she would not venture, knowing that if she cannot swim in the deepest waters, she is safe when not beyond her depth. But Mrs. Bordman would not swim at all, unless it was with the biggest fish; she/scorned those who paddled around near the shore among the reeds, and yet she required the buoy of William to keep her afloat out among the sharks," she con- tinued.             .       ' Did William send them the money?"Emma asked. "O, yes, he sent ten thousand, as that with the sale of the farm and distillery would check the impatience of the creditors until something could be realized from other sources," Ellen replied, knowingly. "But did Isaac contribute anything towards helping him upon his, feet again?"Emma asked, thoughtfully. "No, indeed, he didn't. lie would let them break down so poor as not to have a shilling left before he would let them have a cent. He hasn't forgotten the manner in which she used him and us yet, and I guess he never will. When she was down the last time he remon- strated with her in kind and brotherly terms on the anomalous position of William, and the ruinous, nay, scandalous consequences it would entail upon all if she persisted in her resolve. She turned a deaf ear to all the arguments he could adduce, and said, in a cold, kind of 'mind-your-business manner,' that she would risk all the scandal there would ever be, for Bridget would soon marry Richard, and then itwould be all settled. She knew there was not a word of truth in the reports that he and his friends had circulated, to the damage of himself and the cause which he espoused. "O, how raving mad he was then, and he declared that neither his wife nor her friends should ever visit in any home she might select, or at William's; for if she had no nicer perception of the delicacy of such a position, his wife and her friends should have. They would never enter his house so long as he retained that miserable thing. And she only said, ' Wall, if you won't visit there, I shall have to come jand visit here,' and thus went on with a long discourse about the impertinence of some in obtruding their counsels and suggestions upon the notice of others, who were as competent to manage their affairs as they were themselves. They had a long and angry talk; but she has such a flippant tongue, he had no business with her, for she received his pas- tionte declamations in cold indifference, and then in turn used such              *    SARAH'S BLINDNESS,          347 carefully-selected words, and she expressed them too, in a calm, im- perturbed manner; as if she were talking to a little child whom she did not fear, but whom she could make afraid if she should only allow the full volume of wrath to-be poured out." "I wonder what he will do now? for he will hardly want to stay there sheared of so much glory," Emma asked. "I don't know, but I suppose they will try and set him up in: busi- ness somewhere else, so that he may appear not to be broken entirely; for no one need know who is at the bottom of it, and maybe in that way he can recuperate up his finances and place himself on a presenta- ble footing with his fellows," Ellen replied in evident satisfaction. "I wonder at Isaac's helping him any, since, as you say she rather got the best of him in the argument they had on the issue," Emma said. ' O0, he never lays up anything in that way against anybody ; but he will not trust money where he thinks it is not absolutely safe. not even if he were his best friend; though if he could help him, and get his money back without any trouble, I don't know but he would lend a fellow a little assistance. He certainly would not object to going into a partnership with a relative who was in need of actual help, for he could lose nothing by it, or at least, no more than he would in other businesses liable to all the fluctuations of the markets, and acidents by fire. He could keep a watchful eye upon him, and see he didn't run into any ruinous speculations, which would involve the whole." Sarah had of late been troubled with her eyes, and, being alarmed lest the sight should utterly fail, everything was being done to retard, if not wholly restore back to usefulness, the gradually decaying sight. It was an amaurosis, the most sure and most fatal disease of the eyes. They looked perfectly well and natural, while they were every day grow- ing worse and worse. It had been growing on them for years; but as they wished so alarming a symptom kept quiet, but little was known outside their immediate friends and relations. Everything that could be done was done, and every scientific man, far and near, who had ever cured the blind, or the deif, or the halt, was sought out and his reme- dies applied; still the disease kept growing each day worse, until at last she lost the use of one eye entirely, and the other is but partially whole. It is feared now that she will soon be totally blind. Sad, in- deed, it is to think that she who has so long been therride of the house, and the glory of M --, of herself, and before whom so many knees have bowed, and so many tongues confessed their love, should Beet with so melancholy a fate. Let us drop a tear upon the weak-   348        LIVE ON THE WING. ness of human nature, and exclaim with the Psalmist," O, Glory, where art thou " then lay our mouths in the dust. Neither can we think it a visitation of Providence for sins comnmit- ted, for we know of nothing which would justify thb infliction of so severe a punishment, unless, indeed, it is in the rejection of Charlie Spencer, who, as we have seen, met with so melancholy an end, the primary cause of which was the heart which turned against him, and the hand which spurned him from her. No one will deny her the right to do this, if she has just cause for it, neitl;er will any one, if she has not; but we can frown upon such wilful perverseness, and not grant that respect which otherwise her character would merit. The brothers and Thomas purchased a distillery in Buffalo, and thither the latter moved with his family. His business was all closed up in the West, and he, with the remnants of his fortune, returned to live in a more congenial atmosphere, untainted with. the rumors of his failure, and probable still lower declension. Here they were near the scene of this romance, in which they had played such an important part, and to which they could now contribute more of their attention. They used to come down quite frequently, and stay a week or two, or a month, and then return; but during these visits none of her relatives called upon her, except Sophia, and from her they received all the news worth hearing. All the rest resolutely adhered to the policy of non-intercourse, and she would, if it had been desirable to Isaac and his party. They wanted somebody to tell them what was said, and what was the future prospect. This was more a pleasure to her than otherwise, as it made her the means of intercommunicatidn both ways; consequently, she was much sought after by the delegates of either party, and closely questioned as to what was said. She had a very retentive memory, thus enabling, her to give not only a full, but also quite a satisfactory account of the meetings of the conventions of the respective belligerents. Which will eventually win, time only can decide. In the year '69 she came down, and tried hard to get her relatives to come and visit her. She' went repeatedly to their residences, and invited them to come on a certain day; but they all evaded the question, with excuses of future and pressing engagements, which would consume all the time she had resolved to stay, Perhaps some promised to some, but when the day arrived, had forgotten it, and con- sequently did not. She drew what consolation she could from William, and William from her, but the conclusion was, that they did not mean to come; and as far as they were concerned, they did not care: They   OinAI A  'iAU liE DESPISED.       349 could live, perhaps, if they did not come, and this was all any of them could do. After she had tried in vain to get them to come down and see her, she finally gaveit up, as- all of us do after trying a certain length of time to accomplish what always seems possible, and she resolved to re urn home, and wait for the future development of events, which might shape themselves in such a way as to compel her recreant rela- tives to visit her, or which would shut the mouths of her detractors, and vilifiers, and scandal-mongers. She would wait and see. She has waited, and has seen the fruits of her blind negligence, till now, per- haps, she is sorry for some of the missteps she has taken. No one knew anything as yet, so it was nothing but the gossip of the evil-minded. They would talk- if not of them, then of others; and the only way to stop it, is to close our ears, and pay no attention whatever to any of the dark and scandalous insinuations which are thrown out. Let them talk, and keep on talking--who cares? They probably will get sick of it after a while, and settle down to quiet life and usefulness; but as they are spending their time now, they are of no use to themselves, but are an absolute damage to everybody else. There ought to be some law made and provided to punish scandalous heresies, to protect innocent citizens in. the peaceful pursuits of life; but no, everybody is subjected to this awful exposure of their charac- ter, and are drawn over the coals of their fiery criticisms, not only once, but twice, and oftener, until their feelings are seared by the fiery ordeal through which they have passed. At last she started for home, resolving to leave the field of her dis- comfiture and perplexing embarrassments. The day was named in advance, and it spread to all her foes, who cheered in their triumph: how it could get abroad, so they could act simultaneously, let every one conjecture. Sophia told--don't you believe? Yes. Well, she started that day, as had been announced; and about three o'clock in the afternoon, - it was the fashionable visiting hour, - and just after she had stepped aboard the cars, the whole party, in splendid array, whom she had been trying so long to visit her, dashed down to see her off; but she had gone, unfortunately, so they did not wish her a safe journey. Wasn't it awful bad to he used thus Yes, it was, and in such a way. It was a mocking triumph. But she survived it, and so did he, and are living now as quietly, if not contentedly, as if nothing had happened. She heard of it, and sighed, but didn't weep; no, her tears were frozen at the fountain by indignation and shame. She could have prevented all this by one little word, but she would not speak it. 30   350        LOVE ON THE WING. She wanted money, or rather her children might, because her own was fast disappearing from her nerveless grasp, and they must not be left destitute. No, her brother William would see that they had some- thing. He had been very obedient through all the eventful years of his life, and she would reward him with her love and the care of her children, whom she now found were quite burdensone. In another year she would move down the whole family, and live there as a shield between him and his calumniators, who would, perhaps, some day want a favor which he would be loath to grant.  The next year she moved down, bag and baggage, and resolved to weather out the storm. .She would not forsake her brother during these trials, but like a brave and courageous woman, resolved to live with him in glory, and die with him in shame. She wouldn't- no, she wouldn't,--for spite, say one word that would influence William to rid himself of this hated wench - a disgrace to him, a disgrace to her, and a shame to the town. Her name was associated with all the evil characters around, and bandied about like a foothall, with jeers and sarcasms. Was she seen coming, folks, turned their faces, and blushed, and they were ashamed to meet the leering, impudent gaze of one who, by her man- ner of brazen insolence, told plainly the damning sin of her heart. It was this villanous wench that a lady of agreeable manners, of reputed wealth, of respectable standing in society, and with a family of growing up children,- one already a young lady, - came to protect against the just accusations of an indignant and outraged people. She whom the meanest of the people would object to having in their families, was encouraged and protected by one who, of all the rest of the world, should have been the first to denounce and expel her from the place. She whom everybody loathed, as unfit to occupy a position in any circle of respectability, was here conceded the privi- leges of a lady -a title which, if applied to her, every other female would be justified in refusing to accept. She had forfeited the con- fidence of everybody by her outlandish conduct. She couldn't ride in a public conveyance without talking and laughing so loud as to attract the attention of the passagers, and she has been known to use words of an indecent character in public - words which should never be pro- nounced by any one on any occasion. Her moral sensibilities were blunted, or entirely dead. She had no idea of the fitness of things. She had no idea of the proprieties of speech, what should be said, and what should not; but obeying/ the impulse of a passionate will, she blurted out anything and everything which happened to be nearest her   BRIDGET O'CONNOR'S INFAMY.         351 tongue; and these, because conceived by a mind uncultivated, would be either rude, vulgar, or profane. Ignorance, by itself, can be toler- ated; but when you come to add insolence to it, then ask us to be charitable, it is going a little beyond the bounds of moderation. I say insolence alone, but I might add all the other vices in the catalogue of vulgarity, of sin, of wickedness, and then do her no wrong, for what she is, and what everybody knows she possesses, it is no wrong to affix to her character. If a person wantonly wallows in mud and mire, a handful of dust thrown on him will not add any filth to his already disgusting person: so it is of her, for nothing can be said of her that will blacken the infamy of her soul. It is steeped in guilt, of the black- est and most damnable kind. She is a miserable representative of our mother Eve, whom two intelligent, - no, not intelligent, - but mistaken persons, conspire to shield from the indignation of a justly enraged public -she, whose very life, and name, and attributes are scandalous. All the men, throughout the length and breadth of the world, couldn't do it; for you might get around her on every side, so thick, and deep, and impenetrable that not a ray of light could pierce the hell of her presence, still from out of it, in every direction, both up and down, and horizontally, would come the flaning words of fire, "She is infa- my illustrated, absolute, and entire within herself." No blacker guilt, no greater sin can be added to her already surcharged wickedness. You may take all the wickedness the world has ever seen, or known, or imagined, and simmer it all down into as small a compass as possi- ble, and breathe into the huge, unsightly mass the breath of life, and then name it Bridget O'Connor, and you have her complete. Hell knows no better friend, and heaven no greater foe; and while she des- ecrates the fair face of the earth with her presence, and contaminates the fragrant air with her baleful breath, the sons of men shall know no peace, no happiness, and - unless she dies pretty soon - no salvation beyond the grave.      .        .t   352        LOVE ON THE WING. CHAPTER L. WILL AND BRIDGET. -RICHARD'S DREAM. SUPPOSE now it is about time that we talk of marrying this thing in the shape of woman; but we will not speakof it much, for the story, as well as the lives of the parties, is fast drawing to a close, and in a short time she will be known only as a thing of the past, to be execrated and despised by all. Perhaps, unhaply, no greater reward will await the virtuous and exemplary. We do not refer to these dialogues near as often as they occurred, for the reason that nearly the same words are used, and the same sense conveyed. Nearly every day the subject was touched upon in some way or other. Sometimes William was urging her to use every en- deavor to get Richard, and on these occasions she held off, would not listen, and did not care whether she married " the old fewl" or not. And then, on other occasions, when a fear of her own unworthiness presented itselfto her, and her chances each aay growing more and more slim of getting William, she, in turn, would urge him to greater exertions, and even blame him for all the shortcomings of the past. If he had done as he ought, she would have been married before now. She had been willing enough all the while, and encouraged him in the hope that he would not object to marriage with her, while he had been so negligent of his own business as to permit the most favora- ble opportunities to pass unemployed, and she had been doing all, and more than anybody else would have required of her. She would not put up with such usage, and be talked about by everybody, and be neglected at home. Either he must marry her, or help her marry Richard; she didn't care which. Neither of them were worth having; but still out of pity for them, or one of them, she didn't know but she would condescend to take one of them. If she did, it would be from pity, not love. She wouldn't love anybody, especially the mean, good- for-nothing Yankees. They " want fit for anybody to marry, and she wondered how anybody could be fewl enough to marry any of them." She " wouldn't, if it wasn't to 'accommodate them." Thus she would go on for a while, and then, as William did not get angry, but kept on talking abstractedly and indifferently of his purposes, wishes, and aims, she would relent somewhat of her bitter-   WILLIAM'S PERTURBATION.     .    353 ness against them, and be willing, under the existing and trying cir- cumstances of the case, to accept one. But she wouldn't concede as much to anybody else, for she didn't like the good-for-nothing Yan- kees well enough. -She did not "like them any more than a cat liked hot soap." After saying this about a dozen times in the course'of an evening, to be sure you had not forgotten it, and laughing over it as if she had said something cunning, she would leave the room in a tow- ering rage, to think no one could see the fun of the joke and laugh too. William always laughed when she laughed, and thought she was smart when she thought so, because he had to, in order to live in peace with her ; for a negligence of this kind would be sure to bring down upon his bald and defenceless head all the vengeance of her wrath, which nothing could assuage nor retard until the full volume was poured out. It was torturing oftentimes, but he sweat and groaned it out, to breathe freer for a short time, till another storm should arise. And during these times they arose pretty often, for the dark clouds were gathering round her pretty fast, and something would have to be done soon, or else it would be forever too late. Delays are dangerous, not only now, but will be always; for the longer such a thing is put off, the more impossible it is to accomplish, unless it is by the mutual consent of the betrothed themselves, and even then it is not always safe; for there are always latent influences at work over which they have no control, and of the existence of which they are sometimes wholly ignorant. Somebody may be plotting against them, or a jealous rival may be sharpening a knife on a stove-pipe, or somewhere else.  Richard could always tell when William had passed through one of these storms, for he had been so nearoto hell that he smelt of brimstone. His thin white hair was often scorched, and the whiskers under his chin crisped, perhaps where her baleful hands had touched them. He was irritable and impatient, and he manifested these emotions, not only by words, but by his looks and actions. Others observed these darker shades, but not knowing the cause, attributed them to some freak of his disposition, and, like the others, unaccountable; they never came, however, unless caused by some such commotion, for generally his mind was calm and imperturbable, and fromi which reflected the images of whatever was presented, and, unlike ordinary mirrors, retained the impression long after the object was withdrawn. The image you saw and recognized, if you penetrated beyond the mere externals; but if you only took a superficial view of him, he appeared only like an ordi- nary, good-natured, clever-hearted sort of a fellow, and by these des- 30    354        LOVE ON THE WING. i nations is he known. William Wood is a synonyme for all that is good and commendable in disposition, while his counterpart is the d:rect opposite; and these two extremes meet daily, when jars are heard, with loud and boisterous declamations. "You haven't said anythin' at all to him lately, and it ain't no won- der he do:'t say nothin' to me. If you would spur up a little, and do somethin', why, I might hear somethin'," she said at last, wearied with his tantalizing.  "Wall, I m a i to commence on' him again in a short time, and see what he says, but there is no use of my talking, unless you put in and hellp me; and when he comes around again - he wasn't there more than half of the time - you want to be pleasant, and say you are glad to see him, and it is pleasant to have him come. Don't say anything about hot soap, for that only makes matters worse, and all Christendom couldn't get a man to like a woman after he hears her say it,". he re- turned, critically. "Wall, I will say it. What do you suppose I care, if he don't like it? He'll find, I guess, he'll have to put up with things a good deal worse nor that, when hegets me. Do you suppose I'm goin' to let him know I'm dead in love with him, and want to merry him? No, sir; I wouldn't do it for the best man in the country, so I wouldn't. O, you needn't shake your head, for I mean every word of it, and I'm goin' to stick to it, if I never merry," she said, angrily, yet half willing to be convinced of the impracticability of such a course. "Wall, if that is the way you propose to do, there is no use of my saying anything; for I have brought him in here before now, and left him with you, on purpose; and when I thought he was just ready to propose, you would blurt out something that would change' all his love into hatred, and he would say nothing more about it. You -would think  in a few moments afterwards that he never entertained a thought of marriage, he would be so utterly impregnable to every hint and sug- gestion. 'The only way to get persons to marry, is for them to gain one another's good will and confidence, then it is easy enough; but so long as you hang off in this way, and say you don't care, and try, theie's no use of talking, for all the men in the country couldn't marry a couple if they wouldn't. Two can marry of themselves, without the aid of anybody, and often they do, even against the opposition of parents and friends. So, you see, it depends more on you than on me, and if you don't do anything, I can't if I. would. He would no more bite a bait held out by me than a bud would; but let me throw it down where he can see it, and leave him to think it was you, not me, who put it there, he might take, if you don't put any poison on it," he said, carelessly.   WILLIAM, URGES RICHARD TO MARRY.        355 "Wall, I will put pizen on it if he don't toe up purty soon, fur I'm darned if I'm going to bh fooled by him all the time, nor by anybody else. I hain't that kind, nor never wasn't, neither. I never could bear to see anybody run on another, an' I allus took up the part of the weakest, and give it back to 'em, in the way they didn't like. But go on an' get him to come around, an' I'll see if I can be good to him; but I don't much 'spect I can, fur it is so dumbed hard to feel contrary from natural that I don't believe it will last very long," she replied. "I guess I'll take him out to Auburn some day, and see what I can make of him. I'll hint marriage to him along the road, and perhaps I can get him to take; any way, I'll do my best, and leave the rest with him. If he don't nlean to marry, why, then there is no use of saying anything more." In this way the evening was spent, with others before and afterwards. It was a warm day in June, and Richard very much disliked the trip to Auburn, and not until she had asked him twice, and because William wanted him to go, did he consent. He disliked very much the trouble of fixing, and the intolerable heat; but the case was imperative, and could not be delayed. The ride to Auburn was pleasant enough, for William kept up a continual talk on love, courtship, marriage, and the happiness of wedded life. Over this road he had seen some happy times. It was while he was attending school in Jordan, a party of twenty-two clubbed together and engaged a team of four horses, hitched to one long sleigh, one Christmas, and they enjoyed themselves hugely. They had enough to eat and drink, perhaps more than they could com- fortably sustain, for he mentioned sundry accidents on the return trip -which indicated more mirth than steadiness. Richard bore it all without objedting, or dissenting from the con- clusions. Marriage was a good institution, and should not only be sus- tained and encouraged, but, if necessary, enforced; and as for himself, he should try it some day, so he should be enabled to judge for himself '"Wall, now is a good time to commence; furniture is cheap, and liv- ing is low. I should think you would. If I were circumstanced as you are, I wouldn't delay more than a week before I had a pretty little wife of my own," he said, encouragingly, but with ut emphasizing " my own."  "If I could get such a one. But, zounds! man, where would you find such a one?"Richard iasked, as a mischievious twinkle flashed in his eye. William observed the hasty reply, but pretending not to know anything of the cause, continued, - "O, you needn't look very far to find such, and any one who feels so   356        LOVE ON THE WING. inclined can select the best, if the choice happens to meet with the ap- probation of the prospective bride. I hope you will invite me to the wedding when it comes off: will you?" he asked, incredulously, while a despairing smile lit up his anxious face. O, yes, certainly; but it ain't going to take place during this hot weather. A man better be in an African jungle, than a bridegroom such a day as to-day," he said, with a sigh. "I have heard of those who have survived it quite satisfactorily, though no doubt they, like you, would have preferred a time when a man' would not mistake his shadow for himself. Circumstances often compel a man to do that which is against his wishes, and which, if he had his own way, would be deferred until a mold propitious season; but marriage is something which ought not to be long delayed, for there is danger of a man becoming so morose and melancholy, that not only is his desire for marriage gone, but if it wasn't, no one would be willing to shelter herself beneath so gloomy a shade. It is so with me now. When I was young, like you, I thought it was a very nice thing to marry; but now I don't care anything about it. I don't know but I think as much of the ladies as ever, but somehow marriage is distaste- ful to me, though it -wouldn't be to you. You would like it very much, I know, and I would be very much pleased to see you happily unitedito some worthy damsel; and if you want any help to start, 1'll let you have money on long paper," he said, bowing sidewise, and know- ingly, as if to say, you understand. "I thought you was a friend of mine," Richard said; and William, looking up in surprise, said,-- "Of course I am. What makes you think I ain't?," "Why, friends, I thought, always wish one another well; but in this case you wish to see me married, and in the same breath say it is dis- tasteful to you." "Yes, because I'm so old, while you are young, and at just the right age. If I had married when I was of your age, why, I wouldn't think so; and you'll think just as I do by'm-by, if you don't marry pretty soon." "Well, rather than think as you do, why, I will marry at once; for I would rather marry young than never. Don't you ever intend to marry?" "Not if I can help it; but perhaps the pressure will come so hard that I shall have to, though it will be under protest. - It's a free coun- try, and I mean to stick close to the principles for which our patriot fathers fought."   RICHARD PARTIALLY CONSENTS.         357 "Those are my sentiments, Will, exactly. I go in for freedom of action, as well as of speech. I don't mean to act unlawfully, I,- mean in 'the common concerns of life," he said, hastily improving a favorable opportunity. "Yes, you are right; but sometimes, you know, a fellow gets pinched, or in a tight place, when a little from some friend or another would be of great advantage to him; and often to get this he may be compelled to solicit the good offices of a friend, who, to be of service, would have to do that which, on account of the stress of him who solicits, cannot be longer delayed, and which the other would not object doing because of the favorable inducements held out. You see, one friend can often help another, and he who helps, be profited as much as he who is as- sisted; and he who helps, would be doing nothing more than he would sometimes do unsolicited, and still, in doing, would help his friend. It is only a matter of time, that's all. You, of course, intend marrying some time? ' Richard smiled an assenting smile, and he went on: "Wall, now, that much is conceded; and you'd as lief marry to-day as to-morrow?" "Yes, if the morrow isn't Friday." "Of course. Well, then, a year or so won't make any difference, providing a man is prepared for it; and as there is no risk to run in this case, you can marry this year as well as next; and it would please me much, as I think of travelling now soon, and as I can't leave home unless somebody is there who can take care of the place, to have you marry now, move in, and take possession, for you are the only one ca- pable of taking care of such a place during my absence," he said, def- erentially; and as he concladed, he watched Richard closely, in order to read the sentiments of his heart before he uttered them. ' Wall, I will. I'll marry this fall. Will that be soon enough?" he asked, incredulously. "Yes, plenty. Say, then, this fall," he said, much pleased. "But, say, you mustn't get on my track again. If you do, I woh't marry in ten years," he said, a little angrily, as the memory of Sarah flashed across his mind." "What! .Was I ever on your track?" he asked, in surprise. "Was you! I suppose you've .forgotten all aboutit. You didn't go down and see Sarah Perkins, and tell her that you would. marry in a month or so, did you?" he asked, more angry still. "I have no recollection of it. I haven't seen Sarah in over a year," he replied, evasively. "No, I suppose not. You wouldn't have a recollection of anything   358        LOVE ON THE WING. you would rather forget. But I've another in view now; if no one gets her from me, I shall consider my loss more my gain than I, at first, supposed," he said, with a smile, shadowed only by a small cloud. Who is she?" he inquired, anxiously. "You would like to know, I suppose. I thoughI would keep this a little more secret, and see if I couldn't carry it through," he replied. "O, well, you had better go back to first principles, and take up with what you've left behind," he said, and as Richard, didn't immediate- ly reply, he jerked nervously the lines, and almost wished he hadn't said it. "Why, marrying. itself is going back to the very first principles. It was-the first thing Adam and Eve did, to marry. I wonder who mar- ried them, and where their children obtained their wives and husbands; or did brothers and sisters intermarry. I wish the historian had en- tered more into detail on this very important point. Perhaps in the be- ginning the laws of nature were different from what they are now. If a family now should intermarry its own relatives, the children would hardly survive six thousand years. The days of miracles are past." "O, well, we'll leave such philosophizing to those who have the time and the inclination to investigate these mysterious things, while our business is with life, the real, actual life. I never cared to trouble my- self with anything I couldn't see right through at the first glimpse, and if I can't discover the meaning with once reading, I let it go-as not worth knowing. The actual requirements of every-day life trouble me the most- how 1 can get along and save what I have, and, if possible, add a little more to it," he said. They rode along, and talked on indifferent subjects the remainder of the way. On coming home, not much was said, as William was not much encouraged by the manner in which Richard received his sug- gestions. He thought Richard would marry, but he was not encour- aged to think he would marry her whom he had designated. They arrived home about dark, and soon after the scenes of the cay were quite forgotten, or remained a dead letter upon their memories. Nothing further was ever intimated by William to Richard on the sub- ject of marriage, and he pursued his usual round of duties with a sad add heavy heart, occasionally saying, in regard to something, it is played out, and there is no use of talking anything more about it. Richard knew what was meant, yet said nothing. He was paying him back for his past transgressions, and he liked to see him writhe a little beneath the lashes of public sarcasm which were daily laid upon him. It was a punishment he deserved, because he had brought it   BRIDGET BECOMES MORE DECENT.         359 upon himself by his own short-sightedness, and he should have borne it with much more fortitude and resignation than he evinced, for sometimes he frowned angrily upon Richard, and spoke some very cutting words, which, though not said to Richard, were said in his hearing, and intended more for him than any one else. Richard said nothing, but bore all his taunts and railing rebukes without a murmur, not even letting him suspect he thought they were intended for him. In this way the summer passed, and autumn came. Nothing more was said, nothing hinted, except what Bridget bunglingly proposed. It made no difference how fine and secret Wiliam did anything, if she knew anything of it, she would tell all who inquired; and it made no difference how much he cautioned her against telling, she would tell, because she thought it showed a good deal of importance in her to know all the ropes ; and she told it, too, in a way to convince others that she was conscious of the importance of her position. Still he excused her, because she was a woman, and confided in her all his plans, though not without first telling her not to say anything about them.  Richard observed that she was more reserved in manners than she had been, neither did she use so many indecent phrases as she was in the habit formerly. Although her ways and words were always lewd enough, still there was manifestly ahiabatement, and something must be the cause of it. What ould it be? Was she going to reform all her objectionable ways? He oped so. Perhaps it was like the refor- mation of the drunkard, to last only. until a certain object was se- cured, when the old habits would again burst out anew in all their fury. Richard would investigate this, and see if there was a possi- bility of reform. William, probably, was teaching her the rudiments of social life, and trying to impress on her sterile mind the importance of paying a little attention to the common decencies of life. For her sake we will. allow ourselves to indulge in the hope that such was the case. Richard observed' words which should be spoken only under very peculiar circumstances, and these should be foreign to the knowledge of all, except, indeed, to those united in the bands of holy matrimony. She thought them perfectly innocent, because she had not sagacity enough to know that much could be made of them beyond what their. meaning implied. His suspicions were aroused; but it could not be possible that he, who had but a few months before designated himself as a friend, could thus betray the confidence of a friend, and seek to humble him even lower than the vilest malefactor. Our interest often blinds those finer perceptions of our nature, and while it urges us on   360        LOVE ON. THE WING. to the consummation of cherished hopes, we never consider the con- sequences of our blind infatuation; or if we see them, our moral feel- ings are closed against the access of a tender sympathy for the suffer- ing, or degradation, or shame which our scheme, if successful, will entail upon others. Richard watched, and waited, and observed for some time, before he obtained any knowledge that would satisfy his own suspicions. He began to fear that he was wrong;. and for entertaining unfounded and untruthful suspicions against his friend, he began to'be sorry, and feel as if he had done him wrong; and instead of the indifference which he had manifested towards him, he began to be more free, sociable, kind, and loving, because of the unjust suspicions he had before enter- tained. Still the words he had heard her pronounce, without any prov- ocation, or without having any reference to the subject in hand, rang in his ears with fearful, and even painful certainty. They were words which were not original with her, and if they had been, they' were misplaced, and altogether useless. They were like the words written on the wall of a certain Ethiopian palace: "Thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting." Wanting in what? Echo answers. Scandal replies in words loud, and clear, and unmistakable. How could he find out? It was a question he could not very well solve, still he would try. Nothing ever escaped untiring, sleepless vigilance; and if anybody could find out, why he, of all others, was the man, for it was his business to know xactly the whole truth, and any means he might seek to employ were perfectly justifiable, pro- viding it was true, and if not, he would have been excusable. It will hardly be proper to go into further details here, for we wish to write something which all may read without a blush, and with both profit and amusement. We have referred so plainly to the approach- ing scenes, that all may draw their own conclusions, and be right, with- out too much beiing written. Of course it is' nothing that we can help; but as it occurs in the natural course of this story, it is necessary to imply, if not to express, the actual truth, in order to bear, us out in what we have already written, for, it will be remembered, we have been rather severe on the principal actors in this' play; and to exonerate ourselves, and to show out the utterly depraved character of her who aspired to be the wife of one who never wronged her, we have penned these few suggestions. He found that the scandalous reports which had for some time been circulating were but too true, and all the parties could now do was to suffer for their presumption in thus ignoring the rules and requirements ^               "   *     * q   RICHARD'S DREAM.           361 of civilized society, by being punished in the only way such crimes cap be, namely, by the scorn of the public. He passed a sleepless night, the first that was entirely so since his recollection. It was a terrible blow to him, and it wounded him deeply, not so much for himself, but for his friend. She, he believed, could descend no lower than she was already;, but William! and a friend! How impossible it was to rec- oncile such wickedness with such a title. It was bringing hell right into the bosom of the. family, and there polluting all those dear asso- ciations at thefountain head. The devil himself, when he first tempted the guiltless pair, did not do a more wicked thing.. It was the blackest, deepest, and most unpardonable crime known to the law of man; worse, infinitely worse, than murder; for which of the two would you, my male friend, rather do - marry such a thing, or die? As for me, give me death; for rather than have my family circle desecrated by so foul and loathsome a wretch, I would set fire to the house, and perish in the flames. Richard told William of it the next'day, and as the dialogue is not so very objectionable, we will reproduce it. "Will, I had a dre m last night, and it was a most singular one. I dreamed I was in England. Maybe you -don't want to hear it though, do you?"' "Yes; go ahead." "But will you ever tell anybody? for I would not have anybody else know I dreamed such a dream for anything. What do you say? Will you promise not to tell?" "If it is too good to keep, I'll tell; but if it ain't worth a snag to anybody, I won't." "Then I won't tell you, for it is worth a good deal to everybody; that is, it is funny." "Wall, I won't tell, then, if you are bound not to tell me; for I should like to hear it if it is funny." "Wall, it is, and I don't know as I ought to tell you, I'm so afraid you will tell somebody. As I said before, I dreamed I was in England. Was you ever in England?" "Not that I know of." "Was you ever in Ireland?" "I don't think I was. But what makes you ask?What has that to do about your dream?" "O, everything. It is the most important part of it. Ireland is a most beautiful country, and pleasant to live in. Did you ever sail around Ireland?" 31   362        LOVE ON THE WING. "I think not."i "Not even into any of her bays, or rivers, or channels?" "No; but your dream - you said you would tell me that: "Yes, I'm coming to it now. I dreamed I saw a ship sailing around Ireland, and she looked very nice in her white muslin sails. The can- vas was all spread out to the breeze, and the gently-murmuring winds sighed so sweetly among her rigging, that I was half confounded. I stood entranced, and gazed in my dream on the most lovely scene the eye of man ever contemplated. The moon shone down so brightly, and the little wavelets sparkled like gems in a crystal vase; and the ship, as she floated over the tiny, sparkling waves, which dividing, sent a spray of sparkling crystals up the bow, looked so fairy-like that I could have looked, and gazed, and wondered at her still, and then have wished that it would never end. But, O, horror of horrors! -" "' What - what is the matter " O, nothing; I'm only coming to the worst part of the whole dream. She approached a precipice that before I had not seen, almost perpen- dicular; and the water, as it rushed in thundering noise down the stony steps, frightened me almost out of mly dream, and I wouldn't for worlds have been disturbed, I was so delighted. She approached this awful cataract fearlessly, and, methought, certainly she would not attempt the descent, for it was perilous, as the water only covered the stony steep about an inch, and she must needs drag herself along down the rocks, which would at any moment open huge rents in the frail bark, and sink her there outright. It was about ten feet high, and as steps as the roof of a house. You could see the rocks as they jutted. out, like steps, above the water; and I thought no living thing could descend such a place in such array and live. Wall, as I said before, the ship approached this place, and stood a moment, as if contemplat- ing the awful fall, and methought I saw her shudder just upon the brink; but soon she nerved herself anew, and made-the desperate lunge. I looked, and thought, of course, she could never rise from that abyss of darkness and of woe. I looked again, and I thought I heard her splashing in the billows. Yes, it was her, struggling there with the furious waves, and no one near to help her. O, how I pitied the floundering bark; struggling there in that midnight hour alone, with fearful death all around her. I tried to reach her, but I couldn't, she was so low. Finally, I saw her sink, sink beneath the billows of that strange tempestuous sea, and sink never more to rise. She sunk among the billows. Billows! Let me see: is that the word? 'Tis something like it. She sank among the pillows, and they closed over   RELIGION IIBERALIZED.          363 her, and she was forever lost from sight and human sympathy. Wasn't it a most strange dream?" "Yes, it was strange, and I hardly believe it, for it is so natural, and seems so familiar." CHAPTER LI. A MASKED BALL. L  EGG HALL was to be dedicated, and the more imposing the ceremony, the more lasting would be the remembrance of it; consequently a masquerade was proposed, with accompanying festivi- ties. A masked ball is of modern invention, and is, probably, the most exhilarating amusement of the day; for while it permits us to enjoy all the pleasures of the senses, - music, scene, love, flirtation, and romance, -we are concealed behind our mask, where we may enjoy, undis- turbed and unknown, the society of our friends, and admirers, and lovers, as well as tantalize our foes. A masked ball would solemnize so important an event with befitting ceremonies. A large company was invited to attend, and the managers promised to do all in their power to make it not only interesting, but pleasant, to all who would grace the occasion with their presence; and they would never regret the few stamps required, nor the time thus spent, in happy relaxation from the toil and anxieties of life. An evening spent thus endears us more closely to one another, with- out contracting any of the evils of noisy, debauching revelry; and it is with pleasure we see the stiff Calvinistic principles of half a century ago wearing off, .introducing in their stead a common, every-day religion. It is areligion that, while it is good and exemplary, does not deny to the younger of its adherents, and in fact all who wish, a season of re- joicing. People can be happy as well as pious, and religious sects do not pretend to make their converts bow to the same rigid rules as those to which they, in their youth, were forced to submit. Christianity is more tolerant, not, however, from choice, but from necessity; for the members of a Christian church must keep up with the spirit of the age in which they live if they would add proselytes to their cause, else the young will go on in their own way, and set up a religion of their own. Good Christian morals are not endangered or corrupted by a social evening's dance. The only objection that was ever raised against social dances was, because it brought all manner of people into association,   364         LOVE ON THE WING.  and it was thought that the worldly-minded might contaminate the pure spirits around them but now the worldly, like the religious, revere true Christian, consistent piety. A gentleman, whether he be religious or not, will never say or do anything unbecoming, whether in a mixed or partial assembly, and all are esteemed gentlemen who respect the feel- ings, prejudices, and consciences of others. As the religious, so-called, have given up some of their old, starchy, long-faced morals, and seem inclined to be a little more generous, the worldly have also given up their scoffing, bravado manner of greeting the followers of the Meek and Holy, who was not ashamed to take even the poor fishermen fcr His disciples. Each has met the other half way, and each is benefited. The churches have grown in strength by the accession of new members, and are constantly increasing, on account of the more libeial and Christian views they are ingrafting upon their creeds. The worldly, on the other hand, are benefited by asso- ciation with the religious, because it softens down the rougher and more forbidding excrescences of their character, and permits them to draw nearer to those whose sanctimonious self-righteousness heretofore for- bade their approach, even in the ordinary business transactions of life. Great numbers have of late joined the several churches, who, in all probability, would not, if it had not been for the more liberal views entertained. The youth of to-day do not wish to lose all, nor a part of the happiness of life, for the privilege of joining a church; for they, having imbibed some of the intelligence;as well as egotism of the day, think that salvation is not inconsistent with temperate pleasures and mod- est enjoyments; and if religion does not permit a little relaxation, and indulgence of the lesser passions, they would prefer present enjoyment to the future everlasting glory, to which they allude in such glowing words. They would try. and enjoy the present in such a manner as not to wholly debar them from the hope of salvation hereafter. If they couldn't live a strictly religious life in the churches, they would live one without the church; and 'this would permit them to enjoy a social dance, or take a drink with a friend, and this too, without cutting off all hope of salvation beyond the grave. People come upon these changes by a natural intuition, which none can express, butwhich all perceive. When it was first proposed, the elders shrank from it in horror, saying, "It will damn us all; better let them go, than for all to suffer the pains and penalties of such wicked associations." But that which must be, will be;' and though at first it was voted down, while the deacon rubbed his hands in glee, who man- ifested more piety in his words than in his acts, more intolerance than- '  *         1 ,   '   MASKED BALL DESCRIBED.           .65 charity, it was at last carried with but a feeble opposition; and the dea- cons, the sober, grim-faced deacons, had to submit, or withdraw and build up another church. Of course they chose the former, though pro- testing, and they looked with sorrow upon the great latitude permitted, and upon the growing immoralities of the church. They saw that the young converts made useful and exemplary members while in church. They listened as attentively to the expounding of the word, and they labored as assiduously in the promulgation of Christian precepts, and they appeared as sincere and devout, showing by example as well as precept, the path which leads from sin to holiness. But when the thought entered their heads that these same converts danced to the music of stringed instruments, a shudder involuntarily crept over them, and they feared that such Christians could hardly be saved: undoubt- edly they will be, their fears to the contrary notwithstanding, and many others who never dreamed of joining a church. The evening arrived, and the company assembled, and marched into the brilliantly-lighted hall, to the quick, soul-stirring music of the band. The antics of fools, the jokes and repartees of clowns; the staid old maid, and the sprightliness of youthful ladies just blooming into womanhood, their spirits in a flutter of delight; the philosopher, with his cynical looks, cross and cutting sarcasms; the king, in all the great- ness of his :pomp and glory; the student, from cloistered, dingy re- treats, with his pale, attenuated face, his restless, deep-searching, and ambitious eyes; the nun, with her long face, and saintly robes, and charitable signs, fluttering out on each wafture of a musical strain; the deacon ,with his Bible in his hand. is there, in all his sanctimonious holi- ness, and his wife with her tracts or knitting-work; the cardinal and priest are represented in their full regalia, their stately bearing and pompous manners telling quite plainlywho they are; the queen, with her crown of glittering jewels, receives the adulations of her servile courtiers; the peasant and the- prince, the tenant and his lord, here meet upon familiar and equal terms, and exchange those mutual and friendly salutations which their stations in life had before denied them. The mechanic and the merchant, the ploughboy and the farmer, meet to greet one another as friends and brothers, equal, and co-laborers in the field of the world; the milkmaid, with her sparkling eyes and rosy cheeks, blitheful voice and agile movementsi tell where she was reared, and what her duties are; the motherly housewife, with her cares and perplexities, her frowns and her smiles, her rebukes and her encour- aging w'ords; the lover, and his gay affianced, the former with jealous eyes, and the latter with anxious hopes; the rejected suitor, in all his 31*   36G6        LOVE ON THE WING. gloomy desolateness, brooding upon some scheme which will give him back his love, whom he watches with wrathful eyes, as she whirls through the intricacies of the dance, now leaning confidingly, upon the arm of some more fortunate rival, now whispering coquettish words in his ear, and anon blushing deeply at his flattering response. All classes, and circumstances, and conditions of life are assembled here, to talk, to dance, to flirt, and to enjoy themselves generally. It would be remarkable if they didn't, under such favorable circumstances. A ticket is given to each of the company, and they know the whole pro- gramme of the evening, and all they have 'to do is to arrange them- selves in position, and the music commences. As soon as the first melody wafts through the hall, an answering chord in our sympathies is touched, and we vibrate in measured cadences to the soft and enli- vening notes of the orchestra. We are flushed with the glaring lights, the cheering tones, and the excitement of the dance. We whirl through and through, pass around, and sometimes brush quite near her we once loved, and vainly thought she .loved us. Our spirits are flurried, and our heart palpitates much too fast and violent for comfort, or even safety. Others are there, who, like ourselves, have seen their romances, and wept, because of the fickleness of the feminine heart. We look on in delight, yet mourn for the instability of human affections, and the un- certainty of all earthly hopes; and then we try to console ourselves with the reflection that perhaps it happened for the best, and that all our grievances may yet be causes of joy to us; but we wait, and wonder why the happy day is delayed so long, and then comes back the crush-.. ng fear that maybe it never will come. The first cotillon is over, and the fatigued, yet not exhausted company, disperse to their seats, or arrange for the next set which is forming. Some betake themselves to quiet nooks, and in low, yet unmistakable tones, whisper words, which, from other tongues and to other ears would not be objectionable, but as the husband of one wife, to the wife of another husband, is rather embarrassing; but for the fun of it, it is per- missible, provided it goes no further. A couple, of more liberty, had strayed off to a secluded nook in a bay window, the heavy curtains of which partially concealed them from view. The gentleman is a knight, and the lady a queen; the former, after the dance, requested her to promenade, and when they came to the deep window, said, - ' Pray, my queen, sit here, in the cool retreat, and rest from the fatigue." "O no; I'm not so .tired as you would think, though we may rest   FLIRTATION.            367 here a while," she replied, allowing herself to be gently led to an otto- man, upon which she gracefully reclined, while her cavalier seated him- self by her side. "Since first I saw you in the dance, I wished much to tell you the admiration of my heart, and the love I entertain. I can but regret my unworthiness; for had I kingdoms and powers, I would give them all for one sweet smile from you to me. Please let me see your face." he said, gently ulntying the ribbon which confined her mask, which the girl did not resist, but suffered the mask to drop into her lap. The face thus disclosed was well worthy his admiration, and as lie looked he seemed entranced. "None but a royal king hath right here; for no mneaner slave could, with any prospect, offer his all at your feet." He took her dimpled white hand in his, which she had nervously ungloved, and reverently pressed it to his lips, while Flora's face colored to a deeper red, extend- ing even down her neck. Tell me, please, most worthy queen, what is your name, that I may enshrine it in my heart's memory." * My name is Elizabeth." "I know; and more worthily do you represent her. Had she been half as lovely, she would not have died unwedded. You, without her crowns and kingdoms, are more royally a queen, than she who pos- sessed them. You are queen in deed, while she was queen in name. You are crowned'already by accomplishments she never possessed, and right gloriously do they become you, while she had to look to gold and jewels for the ornaments to deck her brow." A step was heard approaching their seclusion, and she, like a fright- ened fawn, hastily snatched up her mask, and was replacing it, when Fred's angry voice demanded why she was there alone. "Come, I will show you to your friends, who are anxiously awaiting you." (' Stay, my sweet lady. Sir! I'll conduct her thither." "! but he will be so angry. I must go. You will excuse me?" she asked, in a fearful, pitying look. "If he is a gentleman, he will act as becomes a gentleman, and ac- cord to a gentleman the privileges that are his. Please take my arm, and I will deliver back the precious trust to the care of your chap- erone." She could not resist such earnest entreaties, and taking the arm of her cavalier, said,- "Fred, I will join you there." Fred bit his lips in anger, and a hardly suppressed imprecation es.   368        LOVE ON THE WING. caped him as the lovers slowly wended their way to the more thickly assembled portion of the hall. Pray, who is that young gentleman who speaks in such an authori- tative tone?" "He is a friend." "And a lover, I suppose?" he asked, with a sigh. "Hardly, though he has been very kind to me." "If you are engaged to him, JI was wrong in not permitting you to accompany him. Are you an affianced?"  "O, no; but here comes Helen. Isn't she pretty?" "Ha, she is most lovely fair. But what, is she a relative of yours?" he asked, looking over. his shoulder in the direction of Fred. "She is my sister, and she personates admirably the haughty Egyp- tian queen," she said, as little Helen came tripping up. "She does so; but she is young." They arrived soon at the group towards which Flora desired to go, and Ned Sympson, bowing politely, quietly withdrew. Flora was bewildered and confused. The scenes through which she had passed were so different from any to which she had been accus- tomed, that they almost unnerved her. Wit and gayety were every- where around, and all seemed to enjoy themselves heartily. Helen was as merry as a bird, and. not a cloud crossed her path that night. Flora looked for Fred among the promenaders, and found him with a lovely princess on his arm; but he would not deign to notice her, even wheli he came so near, that to avoid her must be intentional. She withdrew to the portico, where, seated upon the bench, she wept; for she knew her conduct was displeasing to Fred, who was the last she would offend. The moon was shining down upon the cold, glit- tering snow, making her feel cold, and dreary, and forlorn. Could she reinstate herself in his esteem? She feared not. In the mean time, Ned had sought out his much-esteemed Mrs. Mill, whom he was escorting to the group where he had but a few moments before left his queen, in order that he might be presented, and accom- pany her to supper. She was not there. So the two, arm-in-arm, walked through and through the long hall, and looked inquiringly into the faces of all. Supper would be soon announced, and she could not be found. They made inquiries, and learned that'a young lady was on the portico. Thither they went, and found her bathed in tears. "Why, Flora! why do you weep? Come, Mr. Sympson is here, and wishes to be presented," she said, leaning over, and, raising the fair girl in her arms, imprinted a kiss upon her cold brow.   FRED AND THE PRINCESS.          369 She looked up into the kind, motherly face of Mrs. Mill, and said, in broken whispers,- t I've offended him beyond hope of forgiveness." "Who, my dear?" "Mr. Stephens." O, I guess not. He will get over it. Mr.,Sympson, Miss Bentley; he wishes to escort you to supper." Flora, looking up, smiled, and allowed herself to be led into the house, the heated air 'ofwhich seemed to oppress her, and she leaned  more heavily upon the arm that supported her. i, Do not fear, Miss Bentley, for I would gladly hope to fill his place," he said, encouragingly. "There he is. See! he will not notice me. Do you know the princess upon his arm?" she asked, pleadingly, As she grasped his arm in both her hands, and looked up into his face or a reply that would banish her fears. We will return now, and give a history of Fred's adventures before supper, when a reply to her question will be understood. A princess, in royal robes of satin, trimmed with velvet, and crowned withrgeranium sprigs; verbena roses, and pink buds, among which were little sparkling stars of tin, while her rich, sunny hair fell in waving tresses upon her shoulders, which were but thinly covered with diaph- anous tulle. A chain of gold, with a pencil, locket, and watch attached, encircled her neck. She had been early presented to Fred Stephens, and had danced one set with him, and they were much pleased with one another, - he with her marvellous beauty, graceful, agile movements, and she with his careless, indifferent, sans-,souci manner. His mind was evidently elsewhere, which, she perceiving, made herself more cour- teous than she would have been had he been wholly devoted to her. She observed him looking much and anxiously in one direction, and she wondered what could so much interest him there; finally, as he could endure the suspense no longer, he went thither, and the scene we before recorded, took place. He returned angry, and afterwards devoted himself more exclusively to the fair princess. They waltzed together, and, as they were both proficients, looked like a misty cloud as they floated airily through the dizzy evolutions. It is hardly becoming, and none should dance it except with their most intiniate and personal friends, and then not too long, for fear of dizziness, as she very often would need to be sup- ported in a position, a moment, to regain her breath, rather opposed to modesty.   370        LOVE ON THE WING. Supper was announced, and the masks removed, and Flora sees, for the first time, the beautiful and princely lady is no other than Sarah Perkins, than whom not another in the hall was a more dangerous rival. She sighed as she thought how improbable it was that a recon- cilement could be effected, but she would not allow jealous thoughts to- disturb the happiness of the evening; so, banishing such cares from her mind, she entered with renewed zest into the festivities of the hour. William and Richard were there, though not to dance very much; yet they partook of a hearty supper, and afterwardsdanced two or three plain sets, but left the quadrille and galop waltzes to older, or more experienced hands. The company looked more gay and happy with their masks removed; and as they returned, in noisy merriment, from the dining-room to the hall, a scuffle, or rather loud, angry talking, is heard in an ante-room close by, and wondering what could be the trouble, many of the curi- ous wended their way thither. The door was locked, and nothing but the uproarious voice of a female could be heard, berating, as it were, some offending boy, in nearly these words:- "I should like to know what you wanted to come up here for, if this is the way you be goin' to do. I wish you would come-out here and dance, and show 'm what kind of a man you be. Yous ain't nothin' but a nuisance, anyway, an' you orter be kicked fur spendin' your time in this ere way. Come out here, I say, an' dance. I hain't goin' to put up with such treatment, nohow. I won't leave the room till you come, an' they be all out here listenin' to me. So come along." She concluded, and opened the door to the astonished group, who, with staring eyes and opened mouths, wondered who could be the recipient of such abuse. They came in; and found, to their surprise, William Wood, just recovering, with a yawn, from one of his daily attacks of tongue-lashing. He followed the group in a crestfallen mood, looking more like a spanked youngster than a rational, inde- pendent man. He rubbed the great drops of sweat from his brow, then twisting his Roman nose arouind, emerged at last into the full view of the assembly, towards whom all eyes were turned. He took his place in a set forming in the farthest corner of the room, in which was the virago herself, who was all smiles at the thought of humbling him into obedience, even before the whole assembly. Richard thought he would dance, seeing it was a cotillon. He had danced once at an apple-paring, and again at a husking-bee; anyway, if he never had danced, he would now, for the fun of it. The floor was covered with an eager, anxious, happy gathering, some   SARAH'S RIVAL.           371 talking, and some whispering while leaning lovingly on the arm of a gay cavalier, others were stepping off some piece to the hummed tune of a friend, and all in expectancy they waited for the music to start up. Richard, looking towards-the orchestra, and in a careless, indifferent manner, slowly asked "if they wouldn't please play 'Bonaparte cross- ing the Rhine."' A gentle titter passed round, while each looked at his partner, and smiled, except William - he didn't - nor Bridget, who looked in blank impudence upon what, to her, was nothing. Richard's partner looked up at him astonished, and asked what he meant? "O, nothing; I thought it would be a good tune for a change. ' Va- riety is the spice of life-;' and as they have played all their dancing tunes, I thought that that, as a prelude, would sound well." "O, no doubt it would, as a prelude; but I thought you wished to dance it." William looked much as if he wished the floor would open and swal- low him, but it wouldn't, and he had to stand, and grin and bear it. He cast many very menacing looks towards Richard, who received them all without wincing. 'Soon the figure was finished, to William's infinite relief, and he sought the quietness of seclusion, where nothing but the memory of the masquerade scene could torment him. In the bar-room he took a farewell drink with his friends, and one, whom he hadn't in- vited up, took a glass of water, by himself, and said, - "Here's to the safety of him who crosses the turbid Rhine." He set the glass down as if he had said nothing of much importance, and walked away. William looked at him a withering glance, but said nothing, though his friends, who stood beside him, could hardly suppress a smile. Sarah still wore her wreath of roses, geranium leaves, buds, and tin stars, which sparkled in the brilliant light of the hall like so many diamonds. She was the most richly attired, if not the most beautiful lady in the halL She had a rival, whom we have not yet noticed, and who for regularity of features, clearness of complexion, a sweet and loving disposition, a gentle, unobtrusive manner, had no rival there, nor anywhere. She did not attempt to personate anybody, for her equal had as yet not gone before her, She was simply attired in a crimson mering, trimmed with' purple. No ornaments of any kind, save a simple pink rosebud over one ear. All admirers of a true womanly nature bowed at her shrine. She is extremely wealthy; and while she is able to out- shine them all in the expense and beauty of her toilet, she prefers a Bimple costqme to all the extravagance vanity might dictate.   372        LOVE ON THE WING. When she is conversing with you, she is perfectly easy and unaf- fected, using no highfalutin phrases, but, on the contrary, everything is so bqcoming and proper, and she says it in so gentle and kind a man- ner, that all who meet, love her, not with that passionate lover's love, but it is a kind of reverence, mixed with a brother's protecting kindness. All love her, while only one can possess her, and all think themselves unworthy to pluck the fairest flower that ever bloomed upon the banks of the beautiful Skaneateles. Whatever she does, is done in a consciousness of superiority, yet without manifesting any contempt towards those who would vainly aspire to be her equals; and these she will encourage with pleasant smiles and winning words, rather than push, in contempt, away. She dances gracefully, and in becoming dignity; not entering into the spirit of it as others do, nor, on the other hand, is she cold and indifferent to those innocent enjoyments which, without enervating the mind, strengthen the body and gladden the heart. This is Margaret Ste- phens, than whom none more royally sat queen of all. She was rather grieved at the course her brother had taken in turn- ing so coldly upon Flora, who, she said, "was young, and who had already expressed her regret for the course she had taken, and the un- favorable view you have taken of it." "The girl came to me, and begged me to intercede with you for her. She is sorry, and you can forgive her," she said, pleading almost imperiously. "Yes, she must be very sorry, when she still hangs around him. Why did she not come with me, when I asked her to leave the flatter- ing fop? But, no: she preferred him, and afterwards accepted his escort to supper, the pretty flirt!" he angrily replied. "O, my dear brother, do not speak so of her! It was so sudden, and she had not time to think while he was pleading so affectionately not to leave him so ungallantly. It would have been rather rude in her to leave him, and accept your arm--don't you think it would? Come now, be fair, and deal justly with her. Would you wish to be used so yourself?" she asked, taking hold of his hand, and looking into ihis stern, relentless face. "No, I do not think I would; but, yes, if the gentleman making the request was -" he faltered. "Was engaged to her; but you are not, and you had no more right than a stranger to demand of her, in his hearing, why she was there. Your words were harsh, offensive, and ungentlemanly, and you should seek the earliest opportunity to regain his kindness and good will.   RICHARD AS A CHAPERON,          373 Stop, brother! do not go. Here, she is coming, timid as a wounded doe. Hear her, and you will forgive," she said, holding him tightly by the arm. "Come, Flora, dear, do not avoid us," she continued, as Flora approached her, and putting her arm round her, drew her near, as Fred wrenched himself away, and was lost in the crowd. "There, he is gone! But never mind; we will see him in the morn- ing, and in the mean time I will try and favorably impress him of his duties and obligations," she said, kissing the cold brow now laid upon her bosom, which was so soft to her throbbing temples; and her words were so kind, she gladly would shelter it there forever. "I fear you will hardly succeed, he is so stubborn and hard," she said, almost in tears. It was growing late, and some had already left for home, and among them William was the first, vowing he would never attend another masquerade for all the viragos this side of the Green Isle. He didn't say it to her, though. He was careful what he said to her. Richard came up, and asked to see Flora home. "Not unless you go with both of us," Margaret quickly and smil- ingly rejoined. "I should deem myself most fortunate, indeed, to be thus honored. May I ask why is Flora looking so sad this evening? She was so very happy in the beginning, I thought she would enjoy herself much," he asked, pityingly, while Flora, who had regained her self-possession, was twirling the tassel of her worsted shawl. She pinched Margaret nervously, for fear she would say something she didn't wish him to hear, until Margaret, turning suddenly around, almost screamed from the pain. There was no need of this, for Miss Margaret was not in the habit of disclosing such little episodes to every inquirer, and she said, unhesitatingly,- "It is no wonder, the air of this room is so oppressive, that some of the younger ladies should feel faint, and be obliged to seek the cool air outside, even in the fear of catching their death's cold. I wonder they do not ventilate their public halls more thoroughly, and not smother us with the confined and poisonous exhalations," she said, glancing  curiously up to the frescoed ceiling. "It is, indeed, strange. But those who build public halls seldom condescend to attend a gathering there, whether it is a masquerade, a lecture on temperance, or on Christianity. If Mr. Locktr had to speak here ohe evening, he would cut an aperture through, and insert a four-foot flue to the roof. It would not hurt the appearance of the hall, and would make it much more healthful and pleasant," 32   374        LOVE ON THE WING. Richard said, as if he was wholly unconscious of the real cause of her trouble. "Who did youj say- Mr. Locker  Why, I thought Mr. -" * Hush! don't say it, for I've changed his name, so he won't know, when he reads this story, who built the hall -do you suppose he will?" he asked, smiling. ( "Hardly. I should not have recognized it. But the name of the hall will be familiar to him," she said, thoughtfully, Most of the guests had departed, so the trio sought the cloak-room, where Richard assisted first one, then the other, in assuming her heavy cloaks and furs, when they descended into the cold and frosty air. Sleighs were flying, and bells were ringing, while the joyful song and merry laugh could be heard far in the distance above the din of all other noises. CHAPTER LII. RICHARD AND FLORA. - MAG, AND FRED, AND FLORA. IT will be remembered that we left Richard, a few chapters before, at home in his parlor, and from which Flora had just departed, promising to tell him in the morning. It was summer then, but now it is winter, as we have just been dancing in Legg Hall. The morning came, bright and pleasant, though Richard was too busy with his own gloomy thoughts to observe the loveliness of the morn- ing; but the robins sangaas merrily, and seemed as gay and happy as ever. All nature smiled: why couldn't he? It was strange that, while animate and inanimate things were happy, he should feel so sad. Yet these had not the perplexing cares, and harrowing doubts and fears, which engross, and sometimes perplex, the minds of men and women, for each is troubled alike, each is ambitious, and each despairs, should the cherished object elude his grasp. Not so with the birds; they live on, careless of the future, and certain that the morning light will show them where their food can be found, while we must plot to secure more than enough, to lay up great heaps for future use, which we may not live to consume. Their anxieties would be as great as ours, should they, like us, desire to secure more than would supply their present needs. If- we would live as happy as they, we must narrow down our ambition, and be content with the simple necessaries of life.   RICHARD BAFFLED.           375 Flora rose much happier than she had on the previous mornings. 1She anticipated a bright and happy future, and looked forward with gladness to the haven ofLrest she was so fast approaching; as the returning seaman, whose long absence and constantly decreasing rations have darkened his brow, sees, with a smile of joy, and a heart bounding with thankfulness, the shore he has so. long been watching. The morning passed off much the same as other mornings, only Rich- ard was more uneasy, and moved about, like a discontented spirit, from room to room: He sat in the parlor some time thinking she would not forget her promise if she saw him there, and he as if expecting it. But Flora was very busy getting this, seeing to that, and all those multifa- rious duties which devolve on one who is on the eve of departure. She felt as if she were going home, where nothing but sunshine and joy awaited her. If she thought of Richard, she didn't heed him; and as each only spoke on ordinary and commonplace matters when- ever they met, she had no reason to suspect what were his thoughts nor what he was expecting from her. If he didn't remind her of her promise, she was not going to say anything whatever on the subject. She did not wish to actually reject him nor to accept him yet. She wanted to see, and if he said nothing, it would be a good excuse for her to put off until another time that which should be done to-day. Richard assisted her in some of her preparations, with an anxious, heavy heart, after he had sat in the parlor long enough; and he was on the point of suggesting something several times, but her sagacity prevented him, by provokingly talking on other subjects, .and she introduced them as rapidly as one after another was discussed, not leaving sufficient space between for him to form his thoughts into proper words. In this way the time was passed at the house, and nothing was said about the engagement; but Richard had an opportunity left yet. He would carry her satchel, over, and some of her things, and he could speak of it on the way. It would do as well. And banishing it from his mind, he entered with more zest into the duties of the moment. Presently all was ready for the departure, and Mrs. Lovell, taking her by the hand, said, "You must come over and see me, for I shall be glad to hear of your success and happiness." She wiped a tear from her eye, and leaned against the casing of the door. "O, I most certainly will come every week, for how else shall I ever hope to discharge the debt of gratitude I have incurred, only by the love I will give you?Mrs. Lovell, I am deeply grateful to you for   37 6       LOVE ON THE WING. the kindness you have shown to Helen and me. You have been a very kind mother to us, and I cal but feebly convey the overflowing feelings of my heart," she said, sighing; and throwing her arms around Mrs. Lovell's neck, kissed her tenderly. "Never imind, my dear; you owe me nothing, as-your uncles have regularly paid for your board, and for the same yoi could have been pro- vided anywhere. Don't say anything more of indebtedness. Yot owe me nothing. I am rather your debtor, for your company has been a sol- ace and a joy to me. I watched with pleasure your increasing knowledge of the useful branches of s:udy, as well as those which merely adorn life, making it more pleasant and agreeable. In my youthful days girls were content to learn how to milk a cow, and make butter, and a loaf of bread; but in these fast times, I suppose girls must dress, and go, whether they can afford to or not, and leave the housework to servants or some- body else." "O, I can make bread, and fry cakes; and that omelet! wasn't it good, that I made when Mrs. Jones came over to visit you? I pre- pared the supper that evening, and made the biscuit and the tea while you were in the garden talking about the horrid war, and how glo- i riously Captain -- was killed in gallantly leading a charge of marines at the reduction of Fort Fisher to submission, and the just laws of the country," she replied, pleasantly, though a shade of sadness was vis- ible as she recalled the mournful events of the martial ceremonies. She kissed the aged matron, and calling to Helen, who was sobbing in the bedroom, to come on, she hurried on towards the gate. Richard looked chagrined at this new and unexpected intrusion upon the privacy of his morning walk. But never mind; another opportunity would occur, which would be as well. So they walked on, side by side, talking upon the various incidents of the day, until they reached the gate of the Stephenses. Margaret saw them, and coming to the door, invited them all in. Richard rather demurred at first, but being pressed by Flora, who was anxious to show him what a nice home she was "going to, and Miss Stephens, he, in measured, diffident tread entered the house, Margaret going before. He had never before been surrounded by such a lavish display of wealth. Everything was grand, beautiful, and magnificent, and the sombre tone of the house filled him with awe and admiration, though he had good sense enough not to stare in blank amazement on all he saw, but walked through, from the entrance to the sitting-room, as if he had been in the habit all his life of living surrounded by just such scenes. But the most attractive of all' was Margaret, who pre-   PRAISE OF FLORA.            3" sided with queenly grace over this home of wealth, her mother being an invalid, and mostly confined to her room. "Mr. Lovell, Miss Stephens," Flora said, on turning partially round towards Richard, who -vas following, as soon as they reached the sit- ting-room. Margaret courtesied lowly, as Richard bowed. His hat he removed on entering. "And this is my sister Helen," she said, shoving the pretty brunette forward, who shyly drew back; and no wonder, for braver hearts than hers shrank from approaching too near, for fear of being pre- sumptuously forward; but Margaret came, and drawing her from Flora's side, kissed her, while Flora removed her bonnet and shawl, as if she was at home. "I don't know, Miss Stephens, but I did wrong in opposing Flora's entrance into so delightful a home. I was selfish, and wished much to retain her in our home, because she makes it so much more pleasant than it could possibly be without her; not, however, from the fear that she would not be as well provided for, but because we were losing her from a home where she has so long been the sunlight and the joy. It is not necessary for me to wish her happiness here, for with you she cannot be otherwise," he said, smiling, as he rose. "But say, Mr. Lovell, do not hurry. Allow me to assure you, since you have reluctantly delivered this trust into our keeping, that we will do all in our power to make her happy. I was so much interested in Flora when I saw with what patient assiduity, and Christian piety, and commendable zeal, she pursued our erring youth, and by loving words and smiles induced many to reform and attend with her the Sab- bath school, that I made overtures to her to call and see me, in the hope that I might engage her for a short time to teach our sisters the simple branches, as well as give them music lessons on the piano. I offered her a liberal compensation, and she consented to come," she sail, ap- proaching quite near, and sitting down on the piano-stool. "Yes, so she told me, and I was much pleased to hear you were so deeply interested in her welfare as to propose such high wages," he re- plied, incredulously. "I was anxious to obtain not only the best instructress, but also to have one who was of a mild and gentle disposition, as my sisters are irritable, unlike myself, and will not learn from one who offends them, or does not overlook their foibles and to obtain these two most de- sirable qualities, I was willing to pay well, and fortunately Miss Bent- ley combined them both, and even other very desirable traits which I had not before taken into account," she said, reassuringly. 132* )   378        LOVE ON THE WING. "I think she will be contented and happy here, for if happiness and content are not found here,-I am at a loss to know where one would look," he said, glancing round the superbly furnished apartment; which she, observing, smilingly said,- "Ha! happiness cannot be purchased. The light of the sun shines as freely upon the poor as thiewealthy, and we, thugh more fortunate in some respects, live-no more happily than our poorer neighbors, with. whom I feel, sometimes, as if I would be willing to change lots. We have cares like the rest, and they are all the more annoying, as they are the more numerous than those which trouble others. Our necessi- ties are supplied, so are those of every one, and what more is required to make life happy? Nothing. If we have enough to eat, and drink. and wear, it is all we can ask; all beyond this is unnecessary." "Wouldn't it be well enough to have a little stock on hand, in case of sickness?"Richard asked,-blandly. "O, most certainly; neither did I mean any one to get so much reduced as that. We should all try, that is, those who can, to relieve the actual necessities of the distressed, without, however, reducing our- selves to their condition. Whatever I can do to mitigate the suffer- ings of others, that I will most cheerfully," she said, pityingly. "Come, Helen, we had better be going. See! it is now nearly school-time," he said, on opening the door, and permitting Helen to pass out, then he followed. ",Flora maybe homesick here for a while, and if you- and Helen would come when convenient, it would serve to 'drive her gloomy spirits away," Margaret sAid, on following them out to the door. "( I should be most happy to come often, while Helen, I think, will be in and out, every day. Good by," and he bowed himself away. "Good by--and you too, Helen, good by. Come in often,. Helen, for I shall be much pleased to see you." "Good by - yes, ma'am, I'll come," and off she tripped down the steps to the gate, where she met Richard. "*0 isn't she pretty; she is the most beautiful lady I ever saw. She is so lovely, I was afraid of her," she exclaimed, in innocent ad- miration. Don't talk so loud, she may bear you., She is, indeed, very pretty." Richard returned home, while Helen went to school; The house looked gloomy and forsaken enough, and as he entered and looked upon things that Flora had replaced, he sighed and almost wept. If she would only come back he wouldn't care; but he had a presenti- ment that she wouldn't, and it affected him deeply. He went to her   RICHARD DESPONDENT.           379 room, and saw the hair trunk packed and ready for its journey. He looked about the room, and seemed to take comfort in letting his eyes rest upon the walls and p)ictures, where he was sure her own had so lately been. As it was something he couldn't help, he resigned himself to his loss as best he could, and he went about the ordinary business of his life apparently as cheerfully as ever; but there was an undercurrent of sorrow which no outward semblance could conceal. Days and weeks rolled round, he was the same. Flora's manner had chilled him, had almost frozen his love at the fountain head; yet he tried to reconcile himself with the idea that all true love never runs smooth, and that they would soon meet, to renew more and more dearly the love which he had declared; and the love thus strengthened would be more sweet and more happy because of this most cruel separation. Flora used to come to her old home occasionally, and visit a while, perhaps take tea. Richard sometimes accompanied her back in the evening, but nothing since the memorial evening of the proposal was said of an engagement, or a probable one, and Richard sometimes thought she had forgotten it entirely; for not the least response could he obtain- in reply to any intimations he might make. He began to feel that his presentiment was, as it is in some cases, going to turn out too true. He mourned deeply his loss. It was another of those ter- rible blows which, as it would seem, fate delighted in inflicting upon him. What had he done to merit such retribution? He couldn't tell. He looked back upon his past life, without being able to see wherein he had been very remiss, or negligent, or perversely obstinate. He, like others, was fallible; but, he thought, if he had been guilty of any grave offences, they were the result of an indifferent judgment, rather than a wilful determination to do wrong. He meant to live as exem- plary as was consistent with his own preservation from actual want, and with a due regard to the claims of others. All should live to- gether peaceably, one without wronging the other. This he meant to do. He didn't care for wealth, except such a limited share of it as would enable him to meet comfortably the demands of life. Enough, and no more, was all he desired. To live happily beneath some quiet shade was all he asked; and this was no -great ambition, neither should such a character be guilty of many offences. Neither could any say, up to the present time, that he had in word or deed wronged anybody. Richard did not avail himself of the privilege of calling upon the Stephenses, for fear his just resentment would manifest itself in words he could not restrain, or in signs he could not suppress; for he would   380        LOVE ON THE WING. not pain Margaret with his jealousy, whom he believed was ignorant of his love. Could she have known for a moment, that Richard ex- pected to marry the girl she was endeavoring to wed to her brother, she would have desisted, and sent her home, with a command to marry him at once. Richard would not tell her, neither would Flora, conse- quently she would never know; but she could go on working for one who would make her brother a jewel of a wife, whose influence over him would be great in restraining the evil excesses of his life, while she was working irreparable mischief to another, mischief, too, which might re- sult in more than a present inconvenience. Too many such accidents cannot befall one without leaving their traces behind, either in a deeply- furrowed brow, or in the untimely sprinkling of his head with the frosts of- snow - frosts which could have been delayed had the early sun of spring been permitted longer to shine. Strange and unaccountable fatality! that one should suffer from the evil effects of others' ambition, and yet not be able to lift one finger in his own defence, or, if he does, expose himself to the ridicule and con- tempt of his fellows. For who would say aught against a woman, pro- viding her motives are just, and the cause she advocates is honorable, alike to herself and the well-being of society? But a woman who will deliberately plot, not only the ruin of herself, but also the ruin of a family, now unconscious, nay, unborn, and be raving mad because she don't succeed as soon as she expected, what can be said of her? Ha! Words that would sufficiently execrate such cannot be conceived. It is the wickedest sin of which a woman can possibly be guilty. We will let her rest on the laurels of her own wickedness, and see what happi- ness the future has in store for her. Fred had been accustomed, when Flora was not otherwise engaged, of spending much of his time in her society. He had nothing to do; and all the time he had was at his disposal. They walked in the gar- den, or sat in the arbor, or picked flowers to weave into wreaths, with which to crown Flora's brow. Sometimes he sat and watched her manage the children, who were wilful,' headstrong, and disobedient, sometimes tearing their books into shreds; then again they threw book, or slate, or whatever happened near at hand, at her head, and often these missiles were the cause of no little pain. But she, not despairing, resumed as unconcernedly her duties as if nothing had happened; she didn't let them know by any sign, however vague, that she observed any of their rebellious acts; and when they found they could not drive her away, as they had done several others, they began to be more obe- /  dient and kind. Under such control they improved rapidly, and Flora , *    {   FRlED'S WRATH.           381 was rewarded at last for all she had suffered, by seeing them improve so fast under, her judiciousmanagement. Fred told her one day, after a slate had gone whizzing by her head, to " take a gad and lick them till they could not stand. He would if he were in her place; he would not stand such treatment as that," he said, tremblingly. "O, no; I will subdue that spirit by a course of treatment less ob- jectionable and more effective." Margaret rewarded her munificently for her most signal triumph with presents of dresses and jewelry. She observed with pleasure the love with which Fred began to regard the patient governess, and if the heart speaks by outward signs, that love was amply returned. She hoped this would ripen into matrimony, and all she 6ould do or say should tend to encourage so desirable an event. Thus they progressed until the evening of the masquerade, and of the scenes there enacted the reader is already informed; and it only remains now to show what was done to reconcile them, and what was the result. After this fatal evening, Fred avoided both his sister and Flora all he could. He only saw the former at meals, and then only a few mo- ments, from which, of late, Flora desired to be excused. If she re- frred to the subject, he impatiently dismissed it with a sneer, or some contemptuous remark about poor governesses. Margaret did not like to hear Flora spoken of in that way, and she upbraided her brother for his ungallantry in trying to humiliate a'lady whom she thought her equal, and who m she regarded with the love of a sister. "She is young, and you should overlook so slight a thing. It is unworthy a gentleman, and unbecoming in you. She has represented to me that she is very sorry that, you should be offended at what she thought perfectly innocent amusement. She saw other young ladies who. are engaged receiving the attentions of gentlemen; and as you have not mentioned the subject to her, you should not hold her ac- countable to you. She was at liberty to act as she chose." "Yes, and I am at liberty to act as I choose. I hope you do not think I would be jilted for such a miserable fop as Ned Sympson, do you? I scorn the parallel! If I am to have rivals, let them be worthy my steel, and they or I shall die honorably. But this little upstart! Presumptuous! and worse. If she wishes to train in his ranks, let her, the world is before her; but for me, do not think I would degrade myself thus," he retorted angrily, and, as he finished speaking, he moved towards the door, his eyes gleaming bright, and his flushed face showed how well he had nourished his wrath; and the sound of his words, too, breathed a spirit not his own.   382        LOVE ON THE WING. "Stop! dear brother; it is dangerous for you to go away feeling thus, for something evil' might befall you. Have you forgotten the words you, a short time ago, whispered in her ear-words of love and endearment  Have you forgotten these? She is a woman, you are a man, and should be a gentleman, one who would scorn to-speak of a lady as you have done. How would you like to hear me spoken of in that way? She is alone, and has no brother to redress her wrongs; and his place I am now trying to fill by representing to you the wrong vnu are doing her, me, and yourself. I am your sister, and I would be hers, for a truer and more noble woman never lived. There is no guile, nor selfishness, nor hatred in her heart. Do not, Fred, I entreat you, do not persist in this treatment of her, for it will drive her to dis- traction, or back again to her former home. We shall lose her, and not another one can be found who will do one half as well as she; besides, we shall lose one of the best of friends. Think now, she has been here hardly six months, and the children have learned more than all their lives before; for their sake, see her, if not for your own," she concluded, mournfully. "I may see her, but never again to speak to her; for I would scorn to address the menial, who thinks one like him not unworthy her at- tention. If she can stoop thus low, she, not me nor you, must take the consequences. I do not propose to be dragged down to his level, because she prefers his flatteries to mine. Did I merit this at her hands? What have I done, since we became acquainted, so humili- ating to her as this is to me? Neither you, nor she, can name one thing. If I had been flirting with some unworthy woman, I should deem this an offset, and receive her again into favor. But I have not; neither would I have devoted myself so exclusively to Miss --  had not this governess of yours turned so coldly from me. Had she come with me, when I requested her, all this would have been avoided, and we should have been firm, fast friends to-day. You say it was unlady- like for her to leave him, whom she never met before, and even then did not know his name; but it is not unladylike in her to leave me, one who had been intimate for nearly a year, and was just ready to pro- pose. Ah! I rejoice to think I escaped it even thus. You only look on one side of the question. Think of me, and how I have been served, and you will see this in a different light. You are with her so much that you look through her eyes, not through your own. Listen to my reasoning a while, and you will think that I am the most aggrieved, instead of her." "No, Fred; I would never think so, if you reasoned from now until   MARGARET PLEADS.           383 the day of resurrection. And was her offence ten times as great, you could not impress upon my mind the justice of your decision. She has done nothing worthy so great a punishment, and you may live to regret the unwise course you are pursuing. I firmly believe that Miss  has set you against her, and if she has, her liunishment is already de- creed; for you could not feel so bitterly if some one had not been try- ing to prepossess you against her. O, how I wonder at the depravity of the human heart! and from a woman -a lady! Ha, me!" she sighed, and leaned against the door for support. "1 suppose I may go now?" he muttered, half lovingly, half scorn- fully, as he opened the door, and passed into the hall. "But come again before she goes, for she will return to-day. She says, 'To live where one scorns her, she could not,- no, not for worlds;' and I hardly blame the girl, she has appeared so sad since the dance, because of your cold indifference, that she is not the same lady she was before. I am afraid it will break her heart. O, brother, if you only knew how bad she feels, and that only one kind word from you, and all would be bright and sunshiny again. Say, you will see her, and speak one kind word, will you?" she asked, imploringly. "Why, if she intends to return, I do not know but I will see her. I hardly thought she felt so bad as' that," he said, half pityingly, half , scornfully. "But wait till your angry feelings have subsided more, for she would not dare look at you in your present state of mind. Please come back about three, and be pleasant," she returned, coaxingly. CHAPTER LIII. INTERVIEWS BETWEEN     FRED  AND  SARAH, AND   WIL- "AM  AND RICHARD. "  TW HY do you look in that direction so much? There must be V   some pretty demoiselle lurking unseen behind those damask curtains, who is receiving the devoted from some gay cavalier," Sarah coquettishy said to Fred, as he returned from his fruitless errand of jealousy, looking back, every now and then, a searching glance of ha- tred and revenge, to see if they had or were leaving. "It is that gay, foppish flatterer of a Ned Sympson, who cajoled that girl away from the dance," he returned, in a tone of mixed hatred and love.   384-       LOVE ON THE WING. What  You are not solicitous about her, I hope!" she exclaimed, as she saw the couple advancing towards them. Flora believed they were speaking of her, for the attention of both was turned towards her. "Everybody loves her, she is so sweet, so amiable, and so kind. She plays and sings admirably, and I do not wonder that he has taken a fancy to her; but her I blame for noticing him," said he, scornfully. "O, well, I wouldn't trouble myself about either of them, for they are not worth a moment's consideration; and I wonder that you should care for her, the poor 'destitute orphan," said she, haughtily. "So much the more necessary is it that she should be wise, and not forfeit the respect of the influential, who can, and no doubt would be glad to extend a helping hand to one like her, if she would make such a use of her time and opportunities as would justify one in the hope that the assistance granted would be duly appreciated." "She make a good use of opportunities! Never, and any thought you bestow on her is wasted. All she cares about is dress and the approbation of the weak. Her piety is dissembled, that she may in- gratiate herself into the good graces of her betters," said she, bitterly. "You seem to be better acquainted with her than I am, for I have studied long, and found no such traits." ' Love is blind: neither would you have seen them if they had been ten times more glaring," she retorted, banteringly. "I must give you credit for greater penetration of character than I possess. But I will look again, and if I discover them, I will tell you." "And, if you do not discover them, what will you do?" asked she, eying him closely. "I will inform you of it," he replied. "You need not look in the future, for you have had an illustration of hypocrisy here to-night, and yet you will not allow yourself to be- lieve it," said she, thoughtfully, and a sudden smile lit up her face, as she observed the sudden change of his. "I did not think of that- you are right. How stupid I have been  I wonder you did not speak of that before," said he, as his face re- sumed its natural color. The company was departing, and our heroes thought that they had better be going. He accompanied her to the gate, but did not go in, as the hour was late. He agreed to come on the succeeding evening, and he came, her object being to reduce him to that subjection to her will, that obedience to her would- be the first and only wish of his heart. He, as all others had before him, fell into the snare, and though wounded at first, because of the deception employed, he afterwards   SARAH PIQUED.           385 became more used to the ybke, and bore it uncomplainingly, and even with much satisfaction. It was on the following evening that they were seated in the mag- nificent parlor of Isaac's residence, when the following scene was re- hearsed. After the usual formal greetings had been exchanged, he said,-- "Now, Sarah, you promised, if I came this evening, you would play and sing Casta Diva."' "O, I can't, my fingers are so cold," she replied, shivering close to the register, and at the same time holding out her jewelled fingers, so that the diamonds flashed in the sparkling light over the glowing heat. "You can hardly imagine how disappointed I shall be, for I was an- ticipating a rich entertainment this evening. And I had another object in view; I wished to compare the performance with Flora's, and see if she was really the best pianist in the village," said he, looking in- quisitively into her face, which, as he proceeded, grew darker. "Indeed, if that is what you want to hear me for, you will hardly be gratified; for I don't have my performances criticised by. such a stand- ard. If I can't have a worthier rival than she, I would rather de- cline; for I shouldn't be benefited in either case, whether I won or was  defeated. Victory over her would bring me no laurels, and defeat cer- tainly would bring me sorrow," she haughtily replied. "Well, if you object so much, I will not compare you; but I thought it would be so pleasant to hear it again, and by you, that I could not forego the temptation to ask you. She did sing it most splendidly, and, as I stood in the hall and heard her voice, I could compare it to nothing save that of an angel. The voice rose and fell with such an easy, melodious fulness, - so sweet, and, withal, so full of glory, - that I stood entranced, and thought I was nearing the gate of heaven." It required io more urging to get her to try her hand, even if her efforts were to be compared with the poor orphan governess. She sat down, and after dashing off a prelude, in a style and manner which showed that she held all such competitors in silent contempt, she commenced, and after singing one verse, stopped and said,- "She could not sing before critics, 'and she would not." "It is most splendid, and I wish you would finish it; the evening seems to pass more rapidly." "O, well, I don't like to play all the while, especially when there is so much good news to talk about. How did Miss Flora receive your rebuke?" asked she, on taking a seat near the register. 33   386        LOVE ON THE WING. "I have not yet seen her, but I suppose I must, if she stays in the house," he replied, in a tremulous voice.  ( Why, I'shouldn't think you would keep her there, when her pres- ence is so distasteful to you!" "It is none of my doings, I assure you. Margaret thinks no one in the world can teach children equal to her. Well, she is good, and there is no denying it," said he, approvingly. The common tete-h-tete, so familiar to all, under such trying circum- stances, was the manner in which the weary hours were beguiled away. He left her presence, though, in the full conviction of her own superior excellences, and promised to come again soon. He left her as his betrothed bride, and she wore the symbol of the engagement on her finger, as well as his image in her heart. We will return now to William, who, since the fatal dream, and the episode in Legg Hall, had kept pretty shy of Richard, though he dare not turn back on him entirely, because of his certain knowledge of his transgressions, which he would be sure to disclose. He now began to hate him as cordially as he had on the start- loved him, and he mani- fested it in a great many ways. If he could. cut him by any slight or witticism, he was sure not to let an opportunity pass; and this course of treatment he administered during the remaining two years of the story, without receiving from Richard a single surly retort. But debts cannot run on forever without a payment being made some time, or else a man's credit will materially decline, and he be not trusted again with so long an account. It is better to discharge these little indebted- nesses as we go along, for fear some little item may be overlooked or forgotten; and for such an event to happen would not only be an in- justice to him to whom the debt it due, but also a damage to him who should have paid it. Richard didn't say anything to Bridget about the dream, still he was pretty well persuaded that she had heard of it from some other source; for a more pitiful object he never beheld than she. She had had a sea- son of weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, which Richard heard, and, for a wonder, he divined the cause. After the first paroxysm of grief was over, she relapsed into a more serious and thoughtful mood, and she began to look around for cables and chains with which to hitch her anchor to some rock deep down in the sea. She tried, first of all, William; but he, as on former occasions, would rather have it deferred to a more propitious season. At this she   BRIDGET IN TROUBLE.          387 rather demurred, thinking her. case not analogous to some others which have before been cited; and this deferring policy of William's caused a good many more stornrs to arise than all he had before experienced, and they raged, too, with tenfold more violence than those which ac- companied the impassioned eloquence of his brother. Isaac thought, and perhaps justly, that he -had discharged his sentiments in a man- ner that reflected credit upon him for the manifestation of the sound sense which he had displayed, and the sterling eloquence of his soul. He had exhausted his vocabulary in vain. All the arguments he could adduce had been brought forward and uttered in all the fervor and pathos of his being. At times his voice was low and musical, and per- suasive, in its accents; then again it was of a mournful and sympathetic sound, calling upon him, for the love of his mother, whose memory he should always revere; and then, whein...ilder arguments had failed, he rose into the sublime and terrible, thundering forth the scorns and sneers of the public, and finally the wrath of Almighty God himself, should he continue in the course he was pursuing. But all his efforts faded into insignificance by the side of this terrible scourge of human infirmities. She had the best argument as it was, but it would have been far better if she had not been so instrumental in bringing it around. Her only salvation lay with him or Richard, and it was rather improbable that Richard would comply unless greater inducements were offered. If she could marry anybody else it would be different; but she couldn't, as the knowledge of her wickedness, would be transmitted even beyond the confines of her narrow grave, for both were not pledged in the same manner to eternal secrecy. If William would marry her, why, it was all right, and nobody need trouble them- selves about it, for it was none of their business, not even Richard's; but it was Richard's business when they proposed to marry him to her; yes, yes, it was his business then; and strange to say, he could make it his business in either case, and be perfectly justified in it. She looked upon her former lovers, who had so devotedly laid their hearts at her feet, and sighed, because she could accept of none ot them. Formerly, she had laughed them to scorn for presuming upon her love, when it was already given to. a better than they could ever hope to be. If she could recall the past, and place herself beyond cer- tain events, she would improve opportunities she had allowed so negligently to pass. She had thought them, at the time, of- very triv- ial moment, but their importance seemed to loom up so suddenly before her, as almost to frighten her by their awful spectralness and gloom. She looked forward into the future with dreadful forebodings,   388        LOVE ON THE WING. if William didn't immediately put forth some efforts to redeem, or rather to sanctify, the character he had so basely degraded. "As I am circumstanced at present it-would very materially damage my interests should I entertain any other thoughts than those which relate directly to my business affairs," said William, languidly. O, wall, you had better go up and merry old blind Sarah, now, and then hire me to wait on her; and I guess it wouldn't hurt you to merry  me any more than it would to merry her. Other folks can find time to merry, and so could you, if you was a mind to. Any way, there is one thing certain, you have got to merry me, or get Richard to; for what do you suppose is a-goin' to become of me now, if this goes on so much longer? Everybody is a-talkin' mean things about me, just because I'm here, in this way. There ain't no spark of a man about you, if there was you would do by me as you ought to. No, you don't' care anything about anybody's karacter, if you can only live along from time to time --that's all you care about. You needn't think I'm goin' to stand it much longer, for I hain't. I have borne with it now longer than any dacent woman would. I'd like to see you get any one to come here, and fill my place, and put up with what I have from you, and everybody else," she said, bitterly. "I know I couldn't. I couldn't find one. You've done well, very well; and I'nT glad of it. But you know how I urged you on the start to marry Richard. In him was our only salvation. I can't say any- thing to him now, for I don't know but he would take up a club and knock me down. I'll encourage it all I can with safety to myself, the rest is for you. You must do it all." "Wall, I won't do anything that way. I wouldn't have the misera- ble old thing, no way; for all he is good for is to be peekin' round to see what he can see, and then go and tell of it. I won't have anything to do with him, fur I hate him worse than I ever did afore, an' that, the Lord knows, is useless, fur I hated him bad enough afore," said she, in bitter scorn. "O, wall, that's only making matters worse. The way to do, is to go in for him, and I'll help you all I can, though you are the principal actor in the play, and I'm only a helper in case of necessity. I'll tell you how to introduce it. You know he and old Greedy are some inclined to the theoretical, in domestic as well as political economy. He thinks Brisbane, and Greeley, and Godwin men of -great understanding and wisdom, and anything that they say he will be likely to second, and perhaps adopt. These men advocated a theory with the Brook Farm community, that our present marriage system was not complex enough,   BRIDGET DRAWS A NET.          389 and that it would be better to make our laws and customs more gen- eral, allowing a greater latitude for the development of the social affections; consequently all things were common among the members, goods, chattels, and their wives. Now, you see, you can refer to these antecedent prejudices of his in this way. Have a piece of paper ready; then draw out a number of rooms, placing upon the doors the number of each, from one, say, up to four or five. Then you want to flourish ,your hand around, and bow your head, so he will believe that you just happen to think of it. If you are careless about it, and don't make any mistake, so much the better; but if you happen to make a mistake, - the game is all played out: so be careful. You can do this better than I can, for he don't put any confidence in me, and you want to recollect what he says. You can ask him, you know, when you get the rooms all numbered, how he would like to have his wife go to room number three, when he was occupying number four; and if he says he wouldn't care which room she took, you can reckon on marrying him before a great while; but if he says, - Wall, wait till he says it, then we can tell just what to depend upon. Will you do it so?" "Yes, I suppose I might as well do somethin', fur I can't live so much longer; an' if it wasn't fur makin' a row, I'm dumbed if I wouldn't sue you for a breach of promise. You ought to merry me yourself, that's what you ought to do, and you may have to yet, if you ain't purty careful," said she, menacingly. After this, William urged her every'day to hurry up and see what he had determined upon. Richard heard from her that she would have a talk with him one of these days on the subject, and he looked forward with eager anticipation to the time when a proposal 'of some kind would be made to him. He didn't know what the nature of the propo- sition would be, and he was a little taken aback when the statenent was made in such a careless, off-hand style; but he was at no loss to divine the author. In a short time an opportunity was presented, and Richard was hard- ly aware of the fact, when it was all over., She had a pencil in her hand, and on the margin of a newspaper she marked down a row of squares, which she called rooms, and numbered them. "Now, then, supposin " - and shedmade an elongated motion, as if to shove her arm farther through the sleeve, and bowed her head - " sup- posin' you had a wife, "- the doctrines of the ' . C.' were before re- ferred to, and she,continued, -" and she should go to room number six, while you was occupying number four, what would you do?" asked she; and she looked at. him as if her life depended on the answer, 33*   390        LOVE ON THE WING. while the passions of hope and fear were plainly written on her dis- torted face. Richard perceived at once the drift, and readily answered,- He wouldn't care, provided he was pretty well paid for it." "Why, you couldn't be thinkin' very much of her if that is the way you would do," said she, while the passions of hope and fear alter- nately lightened and darkened her face. O, I don!t know. I would probably be thinking as much of her as she did of me," he replied, coldly. She didn't say anything more on the subject, except to allude to it incidentally, as an event which would some time undoubtedly happen. All the old grudges she had against him were laid up, and would in future years be brought forward, and exposed to his staring eyes. This punishment she had threatened on previous occasions, with the admo- nition that he had better not have too many of them to answer for. It was somewhat strange that the fear of these didn't startle him, nor make him afraid. He kept right on in the usual routine of his daily life just the same, with rather more hope than fear for the future. Richard intimated to Mr. Bordman that it would not be respectable to continue this wench in the house, but he thought William could manage that without any outside interference; and he afterwards informed Mrs. Bordman in a letter, though in as delicate a manner as the sentiments conveyed *ould permit. Richard acquiesced in this decision, and said nothing more to him or her on that subject.  Mr. Bordman had no sooner heard this from Richard, than he told William what had been said, and how mad William was,.yet he didn't say a single word to Richard; for he might have been reminded of cer- tain scenes elsewhere recorded, and which would reflect no very great amount of credit upon him. He didn't care to have these brought up for discussion in -the present state of his mind, for fear he might re- ceive an impulse to do that for which he might be sorry. So he only nourished his wrath, and awaited for the future to shape itself so as to inflict summary vengeance on this most audacious man. Tinme does not delay his onward progress in anticipation of an event so much desired on the one hand, but not so much feared on the other; but he rolls along, meeting out to each his own share of destiny, regardless whether weal or woe is the next in order. The evening of the succeeding one on which the above took place William desired to know the result of the conference with Richard the evening before. 4 It's just as I told you. He won't merry me, now that's certain," she replied, emphatically.   BRIDGET LECTURES WTLTTAM.         391 "But what did he say? If you will inform me, I can tell pretty near what are his thoughts on the subject." "He told me he wouldn't care, if he was purty well paid for it," said site, angrily. "Well, that means there is not enough in the country to pay him. All I have wouldn't be the interest on the principal at three per cent. on what he would demand," returned he, despairingly. "Well, if it is so bad as that, you've got to merry me yourself, for I'm dumbed if I'll stay here an' be talked about any more. So you can conclude one way or the other as quick as you've a mind to, for my mind is made up, an' I ain't'goin' to say nothing more to that old feul; but if you want to say anythin', or do anythin', you can do it. I'm done. I'll never speak to the good-for-nothin' whelp agin. To think of bein' feuled, as I have been by both of you, it's awful; an' it's awful mean in you, when you could just as well merry me as not, an' save all this trouble ;. but you are so dumbed mean, that you won't do anythin' anybody wants you to do. One thing is certain, this has got to play out shortly, an' we'll see who'll come out ahead. I'll bet it won't be me, fur I'd blow the roof off from the top of a man's head if he'd attempt to feul me. I know my business, an' I'm goin' to attend to it too, now you see if I don't.- If anybody gets the start of me, they have got to get up in the mornin', and keep awake all day. I don't believe in lettin' everybody get the start of me. I'll pull hair as long as there is any hair to pull," said she, angrily, " and make as much out of it in the end." Richard, during all this plotting, had his plans, which, as time matured them, he would, if possible, make available. He wanted to get Flora, and then if William wished his services, he would'know how they could be obtained. He had no intention of coercing William,. aside from that silent influence which would exert itself latently upon his mind; but, as we have already seen, his chance for Flora is rather poor. The prospect for Richard looked dark, yet he, like others, didn't despair. He could say what few of his adversaries could not, that he had truth, constancy, and upright intentions on his side, artd that he was not ashamed to tell his part of the story, nor afraid to leave it to the judgment of his contemporaries. True, the great object of Isaac was commendable; but the means he employed to compass it, is the most objectionable feature with him. No one could object to the ambition of Sarah. It was all well enough that she should wish to marry William, for others had wished the same, and failed. As to the means she employed, I leave others to judge for themselves; though as a general thing, any means with a woman to   892        LOVE ON THE WING. bring about such a result are permissible, except downright murder. Greater privileges are granted to her, because she is a woman, and rather leans upon man's indulgence than upon her own energies. No one is to blame for being a fool, as it is natural, and as much a part of the being as are the nose, ears, and; mouth. All are born with it, but it gets rasped off by the friction of life, in the daily inter- course with men, and is replaced by intuition. A good, moderate, pleasant, sociable disposition is always the most desirable kind. Everybody likes such dispositions the best; but whether they are the most tractable in all cases, this story would rather seem to refute. That a man should be so easy and docile as to be cajoled into a course which every right-minded conscience abhors, is saying nothing in favor df him; but he who follows a course which everybody applauds, he is the pattern from which to copy. That one should blindly follow the advice of another, and against the requirements of society and the good name of the family, especially one so deeply in- terested as Mrs. Bordman, and whose interest was so palpable that the weakest sagacity could not fail to comprehend the motives of her pol- ity, this, we think, argues nothing in favor of him who is so easily led. The same influence brought to bear upon almost any one of an imperious temper would cause him to yield. It was the judgment of everybody against one, and that one the most interested of all It would have been for the interest of William for him to marry, - to marry some one, even if it was the Irish wench he protected, rather than to live the butt of the scandalous remarks of everybody, a shame to hi - self, and a disgrace to everybody else. "-        CHAPTER LIV. FLORA  AND  FRED.--SHE   GOES  HOME. -FLORA    AND HELEN.-THEY GET A DUCKING. FRED returned about the time designated, and found the two sit- ting together upon the sofa. They had apparently been talking upon some important and interesting theme, for traces of tears were visible upon Flora's face. She looked at him such a look of pleading sympathy and love as to melt him at once into compassion; and taking the seat left vacant by his sister, who arose to attend to some duties about   FLORA RETURNS TO MRS. LOVELL.        393 the house, which she happened to think of that moment, Flora was about to follow, when* he, taking hold of her hand, which was as cold as ice, said, - Flora," - she started at the sound of his voice, which had in it such a tone of bitterness, -"I was grieved to hear that you took so much at heart the rebuke I intended for him," Their eyes met: in hers was love; in his, scorn. "If I had supposed my conduct so objectionable as to cause such a bitter reproof, I would certainly have accepted your advice, and fol- lowed you into the hall, but the harshness of your manner, and the kindness of his, shut my heart against your appeal, and left it unguarded for him. It was the impulse of the moment, the folly of which I can- not discover, nor the justice of your deportment," said she, withdrawing her hand, and advancing towards the door. "I was not only right then, but your proud and overbearing manner now justifies me in not reversing the decision that I then made. You  may go, I will not retain you," he said, waving an impatient gesture of farewell. Flora descended from the piazza, not as she had so often done before, with a light, tripping step, but in slow, measured tread, and her eyes so blinded with tears that she could hardly see the way. She arrived at her quondam home, and throwing herself into a chair, wept, like a child. i"Why, my deari what in the world is the matter of you? I never saw you look so white and ghost-like before!" exclaimed Mrs. Lovell, on coming from the kitchen, to see who had so unexpectedly arrived. "O, it is nothing much, only they used me so over there, that I could not endure it longer," said she, sobbing. "t O, well, never mind, my child. I am sorry if they used you ill; but here yom will have a home where you will be cared for, and be happy," she returned, feelingly. "Margaret is good enough, but Frederic is not near so kind and lov- ing as he was when I first went there." "Perhaps you have offended him in something," suggested Mrs. Lovell.  "I suppose I have; but he had no reason to be so angry, for what he assigns to be the cause, is just no cause at all. I believe it is only an excuse to get rid of me. Miss Sarah Perkins has an eye there, and perhaps she thinks me in the way." ' O, that Perkins is a revengeful thing, for I recollect your mother saying she spoke unfriendly of her, when she was bowed down with   394        LOVE ON THE WING. grief; and perhaps she intends to follow the children with the same vindictive feelings she so long cherished towards your mother. I don't know what 7i' the world should possess her to act so. But then never mind, never mind, there is room enough here, and we are glad to have you back, though we are sorry that you should have been so unkindly dealt with." As soon as Margaret returned, and saw Fred alone, she inquired of him where Flora was.            ' "I do not know, I am sure. She lbft here-soon after yott did, and I have not seen her since," he replied, languidly. But what did you say to her?" she asked, thinking there must be some cause for her abrupt departure. "Why, I said I was sorry that she should take so much at heart what I intended for him. That is all. She pouted her lips, and re- plied, if her conduct had been as objectionable as I had represented it to be, she would have accepted my counsel and escort. She could not  see the folly of her conduct, nor the justice of my deportment, or words to that effect; and as she finished, she withdrew her hand from mine, and walked towards the door, and there stood until I finished saying what I had commenced, when she closed the door and left; since that time I have not seen her, nor do I care whether I ever do again or not," he said, angrily. "You must have been cold and repulsive in your manner towards her, or you said something more; for she told me but a few moments before that she would be as kind and gracious as you were. She would meet you half way. I will go over to-morrow and see her myself. O, dear, I am sorry a reconciliation could not have been effected; for she is certainly the most amiable lady I ever became acquainted with, and in losing her, we have lost a good friend and an excellent teacher. I believe Miss Perkins has influenced you against her, and yet for what reason, I cannot imagine. I will see if I can get her to take the children over there and teach them; perhaps she will." "You had better send them to school, the same as other folks do, and not be bothered with them in this way. Other children do well enough, and so might these, if you would only think so. There is no use of humoring children in this way; it only enervates them, and makes it impossible for them ever afterwards'to settle down to the stern realities of life." "Well, perhaps I will, if I cannot get Flora to take them under her charge. She will, undoubtedly, give music lessons, and perhaps she may find time to teach a juvenile class."   HRLTE  BANTERS FLORA.        395 Helen had not returned from school when Flora arrived, and when she came, she, was much surprised to see her, and in so much trouble. "Why, Flora! What is the matter, that you return home so soon P Come, let's kill the fatted calf, or in case we haven't a calf, take a chicken. Come, Flora, cheer up, and I'll make merry on the harp of a thousand strings. Do sit up straight, and not bend over so. Good- ness! I wouldn't feei so bad as that, for Fred. Stephens or anybody else," said she, banteringly, as she tried to lift up her head. "O, don't, Helen, please, for you don't know how bad I feel; and my head aches so terribly that I can hardly see," she said, entreatingly. "O, you are lovesick! that's all the matter with you. Fred gave you the mitten, and sent you home.- I guess somebody else will be glad to see you back as well as me, for Richard has been as cross as a bear ever since you've been gone, and he has hardly spoken a kind word since," she said.  "When will he come?" Flora asked. "O, he don't come home until Saturday evening, and then he says it is so lonesome here, he wishes he was back with William. You don't know how desolate he has been, and I can never get him to smile as he used to, you know, all over his face. I guess he thought you had given him the slip. Will you accept him now?You had better, and make sure of himwhile you can. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. You didn't have very good luck beau-catching-- did you P? Will you try it again right away? Others can play. at that as well as you," she continued, teasingly. "Why, what a plague you are! Why don't you let me rest, now I am at home, and not tease me to death?If you are so rejoic d, why not dance, or play, or sing, or anything, rather than tormenting me?"  said she. "O, I am so glad to have you home again, that I don't know what to do; and besides, I want a little fun over it, if I can, at your expense. You 'know you went away from 'here in pretty high expectations, and' you would hardly notice your humble sister in her straitened oircum- stances, an -" "I declare, if you ain't a real. torment, and you know there is not one word of truth in anything you have said; and as for me to sit there and be tantalized any longer, I won't do it," said she, rising, half indignant, half indulgent. "O, well, I wouldn't get mad at that! Indeed, if you had Fred Stephens, you would be mad all the while, and with 4 good deal more re Ion than you have to get mad at me for this,"   896        LOVE ON THE WING. Saturday evening came, and with it Richard. He came in looking as sorrowfully as ever, and seeing no one but the usual occupants, his mother, and Helen, whom he addressed with as much cordiality as his wounded feelings would permit, prepared himself for supper, which was already waiting. Flora had stepped into the adjoining bedroom, and was not seen until just before they were ready to sit down to tea, when she walked out like an apparition before Richard's astonished vision. A roguish smile lit up her face as her eyes met Richard's, who ad- vanced with an exclamation of surprise, and clasped her in his arms. "I'm glad to see you; really, I am. But what is the matter? You look pale. Were those little scholars too many for you? and did they drive you away? Come, sit down, and let's have some supper, for you look fatigued and faint," said he, leading her to the table, and taking a seat by her side.  "You have asked me so many questions, that I don't know where to begin to answer them. But never mind them, and let'it suffice to say I'm here, waiting for the next great offer of six hundred a year." "O, don't think of such a thing again, I beg of you; for really it has seemed like a prison-house since you have been gone- The light and joy-- well, here is Helen, and no one can be really unhappy where she is, no matter how dark and heavy the cloud is that hangs over his heart," said he, glancing pleasantly towards Helen, who was pouting her cherry lips at him. for thinking all the light and joy gonre out be- cause Flora was away. "You haven't forgotten how to flatter since I was here," Flora said, blandly, as she raised her blue eyes to his. The truth is not flattery. As we feel, so we speak. If we say anything, our sentiments are the expression of our feelings, while the passions of our face confirm their sincerity. The face is the mirror, from which the passions of the heart are reflected, while the tongue is the agent that declares them in words. We believe the latter, because we see the truth of them on the face. You may tell the arrant hypo- crite by the restlessness of his eyes and the uneasiness of his manner. Those who fawn and cajole for position, or trust, or favor, you can tell at a glance. In justice to ourselves, we should suppose everybody sin- cere in his declarations, unless we have ample evidence of his menda- city and deceit. Many may be sincere, yet be misguided, and be as unreliable as if they were confirmed rogues." "There! that is the longest speech he has made since you have been gone. It begins to seem like home already," said Helen, looking over to Richard, who sat sipping his tea and waiting on Flora.   FLORA'S ANSWER.           397 "If it freezes to-night and to-morrow the ice will be sufficiently strong to hold us up, and we will have another excursion. We will get the ice-boat down from the wood-house chamber, and Helen may have that, seeing she can't skate very good," said he, glancing pleasantly towards Helen, who had no intention of being put off with the ice- boat while others were skating. "No, indeed, you don't. I guess I can skate good enough. X beat Jim Wheman last winter so badly, that he took off his skates and left the ice, crying; and when I went to the store to get a Boyd's Rhet- oric, he wouldn't wait upon me, he was so deeply offended," said she, archly. "It must have been a great victory to beat him! The poor fellow, 'he can hardly walk on terra firma, say nothing of skating. And as for his crying, it is all bosh, for he wouldn't cry under any circumstances, unless, indeed, some one should jilt him," Flora said. The meal being finished, Richard and Flora repaired to the sitting- room, or parlor, where a bright fire was blazing, and Helen helped Mrs. Lovell clear away and wash the dishes. It was a happy reunion. Richard was especially delighted, and as he closed the door behind him, he said, - "Now, Flora, I hope you will not longer delay the answer you prom- ised me last summer. Tell me, will you be mine, at as early a day as possible?" he asked, still holding hereby the hand, while he looked deep into those eyes, to see if his answer was written there. It was, and clasping her in his arms, he pressed a kiss upon her lips, and said,- "You are my own, my own, at last, and I am ten times more happy now than I could possibly have been had you accepted before! The refining sorrow through which I have passed has chastened this hap- piness, by humbling my spirit, making me more receptive of those finer and more subtle emotions which thrill our being in moments like these. I am. supremely happy;- ny, happier far than I ever thought it possible for one to be this side of the celestial spheres," said he, as they seated themselves upon the sofa. "I am flattered to:think that you esteem this hour so much more happy than all the others of your life. Let me see, you have seen a good many hours, and some of them as perfectly unmixed with any alloy of grief or sadness as it is possible for a happy hour to be. How then can this be so much more-happy than some of those through which you have lived?" she asked, as a cunning smile lit up her face. "I have, no doubt, seen a great many happy hours, but in no one OA   398        LOVE ON THE WING. hour of my existence have the elements which constitute the happiness of this been partaken by me. I would not have been so happy had you accepted my proposition before, unless it had been on a similar occasion like the present; for it is so unexpected, that thehappiness is greatly enhanced by coming at a season, and into a heart ready, -wil- ling, and anxious to receive it."   I The advancing steps of Helen were hea/rd tripping gayly towards the door, thus preventing any further remarks on the subject. They were soon all gathered together once more round the old hearthstone. After all the subjects of interest had been discussed, Helen proposed a song, as being a most fitting amusement to crown so happy an event. "Well, you may sing one, for I,.being a visitor and a stranger, ought to be excused," Flora said, looking towards Richard for encouragement. "Come, Helen, give us one of your soul-Stirring songs, and then, after a while, when Flora gets rested, she may entertain us with one of her spirited performances," Richard said, looking towards Helen, who was pouting. She rose, and seating herself at the piano, pet- tishy asked what they would have. "O, give us ' Home, Sweet Home,' and then, for the next, ' Hone, that Place of Rest,"' Richard replied. O, no, the last is too solemn and mournful for any occasion ex- cept a funeral," Flora exclaimed, while Helen was touching lightly ar4 carelessly a few notes of every tune. At last, as. "Home, Sweet Home" seemed to have the majority, she commenced it. The com- pany listened in mute. attention, and they were very much pleased with Helen's proficiency upon the piano. She finished, and twirling tPtool with a jerk, seated herself at the fire, and waited for Flora to tr3er more accomplished skill. "Now, Flora, let us have ThbLast Rose of Summer,"' Helen said, impatiently. "O, I couldn't play that this evening on any account," she returned, with a sigh. "Well, play anything you can. Come, I haven't heard you for so long a time, I am exceedingly anxious. If you can't sing that, sing 'Roses that Never Fade,' or sing anything; come, you never had to be coaxed so long before. I suppose it is fashionable to be obstinate, and refuse for a good while to gratify the wishes of others, but to my taste, it is not genteel. It looks better to me to see ladies either positively refuse, or within a moment comply," said Helen. "You are right, Helen, and I'll give yol credit for sound judgment and good taste. It is unladylike, not only to keep ptherS waiting, bu   SKATING SCENE.           899 also to keep a young gentleman out in his cutter, waiting an hour or so in the cold for a lady to put on her bonnet and shawl, when it need not take more than a minute." Flora rose at this, and seated herself at the piano, and after a dash- ing prelude, sang, "Why do Summer Roses Fade?"It is a beautiful song, and most splendidly did she sing it. Her soul seemed breathed forth in every word, ib every note, and they penetrated the cold, froity air without, so that some on their way home stopped to listen to the enchanting voice as it warbled forth the words in tones of the sweetest melody. The remainder of the evening was spent, as they always had been, either in agreeable conversation or the reading of some favorite author. I Mrs. Lovell sat by the stand knitting, and apparently oblivious to all surroundings. The air was freezing cold, and if it remained still, as at present, a strong, tough ice would be formed on the lake by morning. The Sab- bath came, and with it the sound of its holy bells, which always awaken thoughts of jqy or sorrow, for nearly all have listened to them under the influence of these emotions. Iour. youthful days, before our hearts had learned sorrow, or our eyes to weep, this sound was the voice of angels, calling us together to bow at the feet of Jesus; and we joyfully obeyed, while our souls were filled to overflowing, with ecstasy and delight. Then when some near and loved friend is buried, the sound of the tolling bell sends a chill of gloom through our hearts, and every stroke seems the knell of death, summoning us into his horrid, un- sightly presence: we reluctantly obeyed, and travelled on towards the tomb, because we mpst, while our hearts were bursting with grief, and. our eyes swollen with weeping. Monday came, clear, cold, and joyful. The ice was clear and strong, and so smooth the wind would blow you along without any exertion. It is already covered with many boys and girls, who, flushed with the exercise and the keen bracing air, are enjoying themselves to the fullest extent. Ice-boats ladened down with youth and beauty, are flying before the winds while ribbons and scarfs are fluttering in the breeze. Joy supreme reigns there. The voice of songs, the ringing laugh of innocence and purity, are heard above the music of the sigh- ing wind, and the industry of the village. Richard and the girls soon join the happy group, and are as merry as a marriage bell. Some bumps are heard, and some tears are shed; but these are expected; nor are maledictions pronounced against the   400        LOVE ON THE WING. ice for being so smooth, for the pain of a fall would rather be endured, than to have enjoyment of the fun limited. The ladies skate until they are tired, and then ride upon the boats, where the pleasure of swift motion is obtained without undergoing any fatigue. The moments fly on eagles' wings, and they melt, uncon- sciously, into hours before we are aware of the fast-fleeing time. J The school-bell announces the hour of assembling, stilr all are reluctant to forego the happiness enjoyed to undertake the more laborious studies of the day. It is not often a season so propitious is to be obtained, and perhaps the teachers will be indulgent, seeing the students have heretofore been so punctual. But some are tired out, and leaving for the school. Those on' the ice-boats wish to circle round once more, and all get on who can, some clinging to the sides, others holding on to some garment or scarf which some more fortunate friend aboard kindly extends, and are drawn be- hind with more speed than they could go if left alorne. They return in joyous mirth, some singing, some- laughing, some hurrahing, together with the waving of adieus, and of greetings with hats, and plumes, and handkerchiefs. The heavy-load, all unconscious of danger, rushes furiously on, nor heeding the cries, and exclamations, and gestures of skating friends, who, knowing their peril, are hastening on at the top of their speed, to prevent an accident which they believe must happen if they keep on this course. But their anxiety is thought, by the ill-fated voyagers, to be an expression of their joy and gladness rather than alarm. An air-hole lay directly in front of them, and into which they were flying, like birds into the snare. The steerer sees the rippling waves, and, turning suddenly, slides the living freight into their watery graves. Screams, and cries, and exclamations are heard, as each. clings to the other, and all to the thin and constantly breaking edge. Friends from the village, relatives, strangers, all hasten out to tender what help can be given in this dark hour's most dreadful calamity. Each arrives, and eagerly inquires for the safety of those known to -b there, and when assured that he or she is safe, a radiant joy of thankfulness beams where but a second before sat sorrow, in her grimmest, most desponding robes. Flora and Helen were both there, and were with the rest drawn from what would otherwise have been a watery grave, but for the timely ar- rival of friends on the ice, and those from the village, who had watched from the windows of the stores the happy excursionists, themselves 'I    IN THE WATER.           401 enjoying it full as much as they who endured the fatigue without escaping the danger. Richard was among those who came running, with his hat swinging overhis head, and his voice calling as loud as his lungs would permit, to shun the danger; bitt the anxiety of friends served more in rescuing them out of the water, than of preventing them from rushing into it, for they no sooner bad touched the water, than willing hands were ready to draw them out. The nearest came first, then. all successively followed; and not until all were drawn out did any leave the spot. They were all, without much difficulty, taken from the water, and none the worse for it exbept wet and cold, without the accompanying rites of baptism. Those who were dry, took each a dripping friend under his wing, and escorted her home, running. Richard assisted Flora home, now pushing, now carrying her, as her strength gradually declined on account of the increased weight, and the difficulty of locomotion, because of her rapidly freezing garments. Immediately after, Helen came tugging along, under the escort of an ardent lover, who, in tears of gladness, saw her safe upon the ice. After the uncomfortable garments had been removed, and dry warm ones substituted, they looked and felt better, and without being any the worse for the dipping, except being terribly frightened. About thirteen boys and girls received a wetting at this catastrophe, and, no doubt, many of them will peruse with pleasure this description of an accident, which, fortunately for them, might have been recorded in a far different book..  The only one who suffered from it was Flora, and she caught a ter- rible cold. At first she didn't mind it, thinking it, like all other colds, would go off, after taking at night, on going to bed, a dose of molasses and ginger, which Mrs. Lovell prepared, saying, " it always cured her." She soaked her feet in warm water, and bundled herself up warm, in hopes of sweating it out. But her hoarseness, with a dry, hacking cough, continued from day to day, though she kept about, and attended to little minor matters, until at last she was compelled to keep her bed, and reluctantly did she comply. 34*   402        LOVE. ON THE WING. CHAPTER LV. SICKNESS AND DEATH OF FLORA. Soon as Richard saw her home, he left foi the scene of his labors with a happy, joyful heart. He was happier this morn- ing than he had been before for months; and rarely had he allowed himself so great a relaxation as he had that morning enjoyed; and he entered into it, too, with all the zest and buoyancy of his youth, en- joying to the fullest extent the exciting sport. The week was to him a happy one; for he knew nothing of the sickness of Flora, and not until he came, Saturday evening, was the painful fact made known to him. She hadn't been confined to her bed but two days, and, as no one entertained the least fear, he was not apprised of her condition. The family physician had not been consulted until Friday. He left a prescription for her, with the usual directions as to diet and nursing, and thought no trouble need be anticipated. He pronounced it inflam- mation of the lungs. His voice and manner indicated perfect confi- dence in himself; but Mrs. Lovell knew that her complaint was one of the worst and most dangerous of uncontagious diseases which can afflict us, and she put forward all the energies of her being, not only to lessen her sufferings, but also to accelerate her recovery. Saturday she seemed worse, and the doctor, when consulted, looked dubious, and faltered in his words of assurance of a speedy restoration of her former health: she was very sick, though not considered abso- lutely dangerous.  Richard came home earlier than usual, for reasons as easily imagined as described, though he knew nothing of her sickness, and he was astonished to find her sick abed. He had not dreamed of such a thing, and he wondered why they hadn't informed him. "Why, you might all die, and I shouldn't know anything of it. It is strange you didn't let me know of this," he said, regrettingly. There was no use of repiniug. He sat himself at work in earnest, and was resolved that nothing should be left undone. The next day he had all the physicians in'the town summoned to her bedside to hold a council, and determine the best course to be pursued. They all returned ambiguous replies to his questions; but rather than be igno.   FLORA'S CONDITION CRITICAL.         403 rant of the true condition of the patient, he sent to Auburn on the fol- lowing day, and had Dr, Stiles summoned, and from him he learned the most painful intelligence. None of the doctors wished to alarm Rlichard any more than he was, nor could any of them give him that assurance he demanded. When he asked Dr. Stiles if her case was critical, he replied,- "No, not necessarily. She undoubtedly will recover; but she re- quires careful nursing, 'for she is very sick." "Doctor, do you believe there will be a lack of nursing in this case P Richard asked, imperiously, though in sadness. No, I hardly think there will."  Then why do you make careful nursing the condition of her re- covery?" he again asked, as he anxiously regarded every lineament of his face. "I did not mean to be understood as making that the only condition, but as one, and the most important among all agents used." "But tell me truly, doctor, for you have a better knowledge of the diagnosis than I have, and I am very anxious to know all that may be acquired in order that I may do all that can be done; and I do not wish to do that which will be of no avail, but to do just exactly what is required the first time. I don't wish to experiment on this patient. Tell me, will she recover fror.. th sickness?" he asked, and waited, as a criminal at the barof justice would wait, to hear his sentence. "You have, heard of criminals being pardoned on the scaffold? if not, I have. We can know nothing of ourselves. Miracles have been performed, and- they may be again. So in this case, she may live, but the odds are all against her, ten to one." Richard commenced turning white from the first word, and kept on growing more and more livid, till he reeled like a drunken man at the close, and finally sat down on the stoop. The doctor t6ok a vial from his pocket, and sprinkled the contents in his face. It revived him, but he said nothing. He sat there a few moments, and then reeled into the/ house. He went up to the bedside, and, taking her thin, white hand in his, pressed it reverently to his lips, exclaiming, - "O, Flora, this is too bad! I wish now he had kept off the ice, and then, O, then all would have been well!" "But why are you so-white? and your hand trembles as if you were excited. Anm I very sick? she asked; and it appeared to hurt her to speak,. "Yes, dear Flora, you are very sick; but the doctors say you will   404        LOVE ON THE WING. recover, and that careful nursing will do much good. Keep as quiet as possible, and let nothing disturb you. We will do everything we can, and you shall be as comfortable as the circumstances permit," he replied, soothingly. "I am very sorry to see you feel so bad, hRichard. I have been the cause of a good deal of trouble to you; but you will forgive me?"-she asked, her voice tremulous with emotion. "Forgive you, darling? I've nothing to forgive you for. Don't think of any such thing. There, that is a good girl. Doctor says you must keep quiet." "But tell me first, then I won't say any more, and I can rest quiet. Am I forgiven?" Richard saw that to put her oft without a definite reply would only prolong the discussion, so he said, "If you will tell me what for, I will answer yes." "Why, for putting you off, without a definite acceptance, when you first proposed." "O,-that is nothing. It is the way everybody does. An affirmative reply is always coaxed from the beloved, even against her apparent opposition. Don't let such thoughts trouble you at. all. Forgiveness would imply some offence, when none has been committed." All further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Helen, who was followed by Miss Stephens. "O, Miss Stephens, I'm glad- you've come, for Flora is so sick, and I fear she will be sick some time," Richard said, on advancing towards her, and, taking her hand, led her to the bedside of the sufferer. "O, Flora, I am very sorry to see you so sick. I was coming over in a day or two to see if I could engage you to teach the children here; but now you will not be able for some time," she said, on taking her hand.  ( My teaching, Margaret, on earth, is finished; when again I teach, it will be in heaven,", she returned, calmly. "You must not despond, for it is half the battle that drives away the disease. If you resolve to live, and brave it through, one little cold wofld hardly cause you to teach in other spheres than earth. I am going to sit up with you to-night, for Mrs. Lovell and Helen must be exhausted," she said, turning to look at Helen, who smiled sorrow- ' fully, glad to receive such friendly assistance, yet sorry for the occasion of it. "We take turns, she one night, and I the next, while Richard sits up every night, and most of the-time "n this room, though he catches   MSS STEPHENS'S SENSE OF DUTY.        405 a nap occasionally in the kitchen, but a very short one. It is my turn to sit up to-night, and it will be very pleasant to have you here with me," said Helen. You must sleep, and I will sit up alone. I amljust as willing to slt up alone entirely, as I am to sit up at all. Perhaps Mr. Lovell had better sleep to-night, and let me fill his place," said she, glancing in- quisitively at Richard. "I wouldn't sleep a:wink if I should retire. I should be uneasy and restless everywhere but here, and not one particle of comfort can I take even here." "But you will wear yourself out by these continued nightly vigils, and, if you are not careful, you will only increase the burden of care, while the good you might do, if prudently directed, is lost," said she. "You have spoken wisely. I will sleep part of the night on the sofa, upon this condition, that I be called if any assistance is required," said he, casting a desponding look upon the sufferer. "O, certainly, you shall be called," she returned, decidedly. "You are very kind, Miss Stephens, to come and sit up with a poor sick orphan, while I fear I never shall be able to discharge the many obligations I have already incurred, say nothing of adding this heavy debt of gratitude to the list," Flora said.  "It is not gratitude; it is a duty we owe to one another, and no one should remember it in gratitude. What if we should all perform such, deeds from a sense of gratitude! Who would be taken care of in case of sickness, if those obligated by gratitude should happen to be away or indisposed?No, it is a duty; and he or she would be venal indeed if he considered whether the person thus assisted ever merited it by acts Qf kindness to himself or friends. When I am sick, I shall expect no more from you than I shall from everybody else." She made some inquiries respecting the iedicine to be given, how often, and in what quantity. She arranged the covering, and patted the pillows, and began to work as if she had always attended upon the sick. Richard withdrew, and left the three alone. "I think, Miss. Stephens, you had better let me sit up withyou, for you will be so lonesome here alone," Helen said, after watching her in silence, as she moved noiselessly about the room, adjusting many little things which always escape the attention of those in excitement and trouble. "No. O, not indeed you shall not. You have each sat up two nights, and it is time that you were both relieved. I will sit up every third night, then we can all get nearly sleep enough. You need net   ,.JU vT J  VI/.N'  . JLJ qJqA. J A . frown so darkly, for I insist upon it, and I shall make it the condition of staying that I sit up alone," said she, imperiously. If you are decided, why, then I won't object; but I thought 1 would make it so much more pleasant for you to sit up and be company. It is so lonesome all night alone, and I dreaded seeing you endure it all so kindly, that is all;" said she. "I should think if you can stand it, I might, surely; for you are cer- tainly younger than I am, and much less able to endure the fatigue of a sick chamber."  -F I am sixteen," she returned, proudly. "And I am two years older so you see I am two years better quali- fied to do this work than you are." "I don't care, you are not so strong. You are more frail and deli- cate." Mrs. Lovell came in to see if all was prepared for the night and everything was arranged. The house was soon all still and quiet, and nothing was heard save the heavy breathing of the patient and the fierce, cold wind as it beat against the windows, or whistled through the leafless boughs, or whirled in angry gusts round the corner of the house. It was, indeed, sad to be alone on such a night, and in a sick chamber. She sat miostly'upon the bedside, and watched the pale sleeper, unconscious of the loneliness around. Her long, silken lashes drooped heavily upon her pallid cheeks, making her look like wax-work, so still, and white, and regular were her features. The blue veins could be distinctly traced beneath the trans- parent cuticle, and at times they seemed almost ready to burst, from the pressure of the inflamed life-current flowing within them. Richard came in about every hour, wondering why he had not been called. Traces of tears were visible upon his face, though he tried to wash them off. "Are you not lonely?" he asked, on taking the rock- ing chair which stood close by the bed. "O, no, not much; still, if you are not going to sleep any, as I see by your eyes you have not, you may sit with ne a little while; but I think it best not to say much, for fear of disturbing, her. She appears to sleep well at intervals, and then her brow contracts, as if pains were coursing through'and through her lungs. These awake her, and then she tries to smile when she sees some one is near, watching her so ten- derly, as if she wished to repay, by some silent token of love, the atten- tion she receives." They sat a moment and watched the unconscious sleeper, and they noticed the spasmodic twitches of the muscles of her face, wondering ;o ' ' So' ;- --het   if they were the effects of the pain she felt at each iaboredbreath. The medicine. was administered every hour, and it was now time to give another prescription; but the doctor said if she was asleep at the time, not to wake her, because the sleep would do her nearly as much good as the medicine. They were to give it immediately on awakening. The tick of the golden watch, as it lay upon the stand, among the vials and glasses, could be distinctly heard, and it added gloom to the solemn stillness of the hour.. As they sat thus alone, watching and silent, Margaret noticed a tear, as it rolled down his cheek and dropped upon the carpet. She had re- solved once before to speak of his interest inFlora; but the delicacy of the position, and the fear of opening afresh the fountain of his grief, restrained her. When she saw the tear, it again reminded her of the resolve she had but half taken; and her curiosity was quickened by her knowledge of some of the events of the past, making her wish to know more, in order that she might discover some of the secret springs which impelled the acts of others. "You seem to entertain more than an ordinary interest in Flora's recovery," said she, lowly. It started him form his reverie, yet ie nerved himself up to a pitch of-replying, without betra)ing any emotion.  Do -you think it strange that I should?" he asked, while a misty vapor. diumed his eyes. "No, I do not; for everybody loves her. Yet, if Ilnayspe blunt ly, your'regard is even more tender than universal love. Is it not par- tial and exclusive?" asked she, nonchalantly. And as she asked it, Flora raised her hand to her head, as if to brush away a pain that lingered there. While her attention was thus directed towards the pa- tient, Richard recove red              her com- posedly. "Yes, she is rather more to' me than an acquaintance, and I hope more than a friend." She bit her lip, till her teeth left an impress there, to conceal her etlotion, while she replaced the covpring which Flora had slightly dis- turbed 'I wonder Flora did not tell me; and I never dreamed she was en. gaged," said she, regretfully. "But why: should so trivial an affair awaken any wondrous feelings or regrets?" he asked, inquiringly. "O, nothing) but I thought she was rather young to have formed such intimate associations," she replied, evasively.  408     LOVE ON THE WING. She is nineteen, and that is not esteemed young in a lady of her de- velopment, wonderful beauty, and kind disposition." elNo, do not know as it is. She awakes, and I think I will give her some medicine, if you will just step there and hold her headup a little; she is rather heavy to hold up with one arm, while the other is ie did as directed, raising the pillow with her head. The patient roused up at being held so steadily, without any qivering, drooping, side-long motion, and she asked who was there holding her up so; for she could see no one behind her head, only Margaret alone. "Richard is here, assisting me, and also is company while you are asleep," she replied. Is Richard here? I'm so glad. Please sit in front, so I can see you, Richard," said she, in faltering voice. uAfter being bolstered up, so as to breathe more easily, Richard seated himself on the opposite side of the bed, and taking her thin, white hand in his, she welcomed him with a smile and look that would have melted stronger hearts than his to pity; to tenderness, and to love. "I'm glad to see you, Richard; but why do you look so sad and gloomy?" she asked, pitying him more than herself. "It is because you are so sick," said he, tenderly. "O, I don't feel very sick; only a little weak, that's all." "That's all! Indeed, my dear girl, you are sicker than that," he re- turned, despairingly. "But!I' really don't feel very bad; only now and then a pain in my lungs, when I draw too long a breath. When I breathe short, I feel no pain." But do not say much, for it excites you, and increases the inflam- mation." "O, pshaw  I want to talk with you so much, and I feel so well, I thought you wouldlet me." "O, I wouldn't, Flora, say much now; wait till you feel better still then I will gladly hear you."d homesadand The night at last wore away, and Margaret returned home, sad and The night at last wore away, weary. Another day came and went, without any apparent abatement of the inflammation. Richard remained in the house constantly, to be ready in case his services were needed in moving her from one bed to another, while the one she last occupied was being made. He carried her in his strong arms, as if she were but a child, and held her at the window, while she gazed out into the cold, chilly air of winter. She was, however, always wrapped up warmly, so as not to take arny more cold.   FLORA'S SABBATH-SCtOOL CLASS.        409 Sunday morning came,and one week had elapsed since she had been confined to her bed. The church-bell rings the hour of preparation for the morning's worship. The sounds but faintly enter the closel- guarded room, and Flora raises, her head in joyful ecstasy, while beam- ing hope irradiates from her shrunken, pallid face. Her cheeks are hol- low, her eyes sunken, and her frame is weak. What a strange contrast a few short days have accomplished-! and yet she endures in patienco her sufferings, the same, as in days of health. The sound of the bell awakens sad memories in Flora's mind, yet there are pleasant associations clustering around it, from the joy of which she would not for worlds be debarred  .She wishes the door left open so as to let the sound come in, and make the heart of sickness glad with its cheering notes. The door is open, -for nothing would Richard deny her, unless it actually endangered her, - but with the sound came in the cold, rushing air, and while the former cheered her spirit, the latter chilled her body, and he found it would not do to grat- ify her in so simple a request. The sounds sank into her soul, and she seemed nourished and strengthened, nearly as much as if she had lis- tened to the preacher's voice. She could not attend church, could not be cheered by the encoura- ging words of a Christian's hope, yet she might draw consolation from the thoughts of the former Christian exhortations she had received; and it sweetened her sorrow to think she had done all she could, of at least had done all shethought of. Richard read to her from the Bible such chapters as she desired, and she drew her own conclusions from what she heard. Richard was not a member, yet he lived a strictly religious life, and Flora hoped, et no distant day, to be able to influence him to accept the creed of his fathers. He was rather averse to this, though he willingly attended church. His youthful discipline had been so strict and onerous that it was distasteful to him, which otherwise lhe would gladly have received. The Sabbath-school class, of which Flora was the teacher, wondered if she would not hear them recite their lessons; for though they had heard she was sick with a slight cold, not one entertained any fears as to her recovery. When they saw an elderly lady seat herself in front of them, they said,  "This is Miss Flora's class, and she will be here pretty soon." "No, Miss Flora is sick, ver sick, and she can't get here to-day, consequently she would have to hear them till she recovered." O, Miss Flora sick! that is too bad," they all either exclaimed or ' 35' '   "O        LOVE ON THE WING. sighed. But little Johnny Young, the little boy to whom she had given the clothes, said he would pray for her; and accordingly he kneeled down in the slip, and offered up the following petition to the throne of grace - "O, good Lord, I be so sorry Miss Flora is sick. Please cure her up, so she can come to Sabbath-school, and teach us wicked boys the way to go. I wonder why Miss Flora is so sick, because other teachers ain't sick, and she is so good and kind, I thought she never would be sick. She prayed to God so much, and seemed to love him better than anybody else. O, Lord, hear me, do, and cure Miss Flora, so we can have the bestest teacher in all the school. I wish I had such a mamma. Please make my mamma so good and kind as Miss Flora is to me. Mamma made me put on my bestest close to weare every day, because my old ones was so torne that my knees came out, and that ugly Jim Jones threw me into a muddy hole, and got my pants all muddy. I thought Miss Flora would be cross to-day, because I was not so clean as I ought to be. O, Lord, hear my humble prayer to-day, and cure good Miss Flora, and 'll be good boy, and not wear my Sunday close every day no more. Amen." Flora; and Richard, and Helen were told about this simple, heart- felt prayer, that same day, and the recital of it melted Richard to tears. He wished he could pray just as good, and he hoped little Johnny would continue offering up such petitions; they fould do far more than the skill of the most learned physicians. While it was being offered up, the class, and those near enough to hear, in silence listened, and in humbleness of spirit bowed their heads, and said Amen, to every thought expressed. Monday morning came, and all thought she was better. Her eyes looked brighter, and were without that glassy appearance so painful to see. The cheeks were as pale and shrunken as before, but that ghast- liness had fled, and a hectic flush burned on them like a living coal. She felt more active, and her appetite was better, but still the symp- toms were more against than in favor of her recovery. The Sabbath-school children nearly all visitedher, and all who were intimately acquainted did not fail to manifest their love by their pres- ence and sympathy. The pastor came, and in sympathetic Words tried to console her friends and himself. Possibly she might recover; aind if God in his kind providence saw fit to take her, why we ought not to demur, for a happier home awaited her, and a crown of everlasting glory was her reward.  Before he left, he kneeled and offered up a prayer for her recovery,   RICHARD'S GREAT GRIEF.          4" if in God's abounding mercy he thought fit to vouchsafe her a longer life. She was young, and to the church was a pillar of strength, and to the cause of Christ a shining glory, Her usefulness among men would be great, and her presence a blessing, of which they could not easily deny themselves. But considerations of an earthly nature have no weight with God when-they conflict with His decrees. His cause is righteousness, and His justice mercy. He afflicts but to chasten us, that we may be more receptive of His holy spirit. His kindness, and earth's afflictions are alike intended for our good. We may not be able to see any benefit accrue to us, to those who are left, but still good will come of it in some shape or another. It may not be imme- diate, it may be years in coming, still good will result. Richard could not see how he could ever be benefited by her death, which he saw, from the countenances of everybody, and from their words, was now believed, as certain to take place within a few days. Such a suspicion he had from the beginning. As soon as the pastor had gone, Richard withdrew to the solitude of his own room, and there sought that relief which could not be found elsewhere. The consolations of friends, and their sympathies, and their prayers, and their entreaties, were the bitterest gall to him. The thought that she would be happy there, did not make him happy here. He was the sufferer, not she. He was the one who was dying, and she was just beginning to live. He threw himself upon the bed he had not occupied for nearly two weeks, and wept, and wept bitter tears. It seemed as if his heart would break, so deep and all-consuming was his grief. The tears flowed in torrents, still no relief camea none could come, none was for him. The fount of mercy was dry, and nothing but bleak, track-. less deserts lay before him, stretched out in one great panorama of wretchedness and woe. What was life to him without her? Might he not die, and go with her, if she was to be so supremely happy? Could he not enjoy with her there the happiness of blissful, requited love? Ah, it is beyond our feeble vision! Let moralists tell of duties to be done, and sins to be avoided, and philosophers prate of things past, and present, and to come; but after all is said and done, earth is earth, and with it passions and foibles must live, must be loved, must be flattered, must be caressed, if- O, how pailful! -if souls would live to enjoy the hereafter. Without lwe without passion, what is life? A mere routine of daily rounds, without ambition to cheer us on, with- out an: object towards which we may look, in hope of some time reach- ing, and of embracing in ecstasy and joy. Would you kill the soul,   ".2        LOVE ON THE WING. and subdue the passions? You cannot; for the former will have its object in life - some noble end, some worthy ambition, which all the energies of its being will be put forward to acquire, to possess; while the latter will seek its affinity, as does the loadstone the magnet, and hav- ing found it, embraces it in delight, and in meek humbleness of heart returns thanks to God for the happy privilege thus vouchsifed it. Such is life; make the most of it, for it cannot, and will never be changed. God rules in all things - passions, hearts, and desires.. What we are, such He made us; and the designs of His providence will certainly be fulfilled. Let none call it weakness to love one worthy of a heart's devoted admiration, for it is the noblest attribute of humanity, given for divine and holy purposes, and by God himself bestowed. We should be false and recreant to Him, to nature, and to ourselves should we fail to discharge the obligations He has imposed, both in acts of love, andwords of thankfulness. We will bow our hearts in meekness, and await for the mercy of His promise. We may not be able to dis- cover the justice of our affliction, but He who is all-wise and omni- present knows our wants, and will provide every necessity. We will wait, in patience wait, with broken, bleeding hearts wait, with voices continually ascending to the throne of mercy wait, petitioning that we be spared from further affliction, and receive, instead of the bitter drug, the promise of His love. Richard kneeled by the bedside, alone in the solitude of his cham- ber, and breathed forth a prayer, short, but earnest, appealing, and devout. His tongue was not accustomed to uttering words of sup- plication, nor his lips to forming them, and he thought, as he had not prayed before, God would not hear him in this his necessitous hour of affliction. In'prosperity he had neglected Him, and now, as afflic- tion was gathering her sable shrouds around him, he came to God, to seek His protecting arm against the sorrow that was now) darkening his; soul. God would not hear. such prayers, however sincere they might be expressed. Still, he might hear. He could not tell. But he would not rely upon his own prayers; he would ask his mother, and she,-together with him, would kneel, and implore the throne of Love for mercy. He descended to the kitchen, where he found his mother washing the dinner dishes. He would not trouble her then, for she would not leave the dish-water to cool. As soon as she had finished, he ap- proached her, and said, - "Come, mother, let us go and pray for Flora, and don't say anything about the missionaries, the heathens, nor the churches; let them all   MRS. LOVELL PRAYS.           413 go, while we direct all our attenion to Flora's recovery. ou ko the other night, at family prayers, you prayed for the heathen, and that God would send his gospel among them, and to protect the missio aries, nd to intil into their hearts love for them, and into their minds knowledge and understanding of God. Don't say anything about them, for there is not time, in such moments as these, to do that which can just aswell be done some other time." "Well, we will go and pray, but I can tell you before you go, all prayers are useless," she returned, sadly. "Well, let us try. We can fail with trying as well as without; and may be He will incline His ear, and listen." "Our Father, who art in heaven, we bow before Thee in humble, contrite spirit, to request the indulgence of Thy favor. One in our midst - a near, a dear friend - lies at the point, nay, at the very door, of death. If it please Thee,restore her to health, and to the love of our hearts. Be merciful to us, in Thy kind and loving providence, be merciful, and spare us the affliction of this sorrow. We may havd been remiss in many things, may have neglected many opportunities, but Thy forbearance is great, and Thy loving mercy endureth forever. Extend it, we pray Thee, even unto us. Be with us in all our duties of life. Go with us in all our journeyings. Be a shield to protect us from the dangers which everywhere beset our pathway. Guard us from the evils of besetting sin, and at last save us, for our Redeem- er's sake. Amen."  "Why, mother, you haven't said a word of Flora. Come, pray again; He don't know anything about what we want. Ask Him to spare Flora's life, and restore her to health. Speak of Flora. Ask Him about Flora -to look in compassion upon poor sick Flora, and help Flora to regain her health. O, how I wish I could pray as good as that, only you didn't have in Flora's name at all," said he, sobbing, while yet on his knees. She turned, and again addressed the throne of mercy: - "O, heavenly Father, wilt Thou restore Thy faithful servant Flora to health? Give her strength to bear with fortitude this affliction, and courage to sustain her drooping. spirits in this trying hour of her distress. Restore Flora, if in Thy all-abounding mrcy Thou soest bestn and permit us all to gng mercy Thou seest est, and permit us all to gather round our, family hearth in happi- ness and peace. Be unto Flora a tower of strength, either to assist her to health, or to sustain her over the dreadful Styx, which separates    "4        LOVE ON THE WING. mortality from immortality, light from darkness, life from death. Hear us, we beseech Thee, and grant our bumble petition i and to Thy name shall be ascribed all the honor, and all the glory, both now and ever- more. Amen." "O, dear mother, you don't pray as I would. I wouldn't say any- thing about that dark river, and death. Don't you think they sound cold and chilly? I would rather hear little Johnny Young pray, for it comes right from his guileless, innocent heart, than all that high- flown diction. It sounds good, but there is not so much real heart and soul in such words as there is in * God, please spare Flora,"' he said, rising. "Well, why don't you pray yourself, then, if I can say nothing to the purpose? I've done the best I can, and if you can pray more sin- cere and devout, why, I would like very much to hear you.. I'll stay here half an hour, if you'll only pray; and I won't find fault with a word of it, either." "O, mother, I would, if I could; but you know I have not accus- tomed myself to it, and consequently don't know what to say. If such good words would come to me as'do to you, why, I would pray night and day, but I would be heard in her behalf. But, no, sinners cannot pray, and have it avail them aught, when nothing but sheer necessity compels them, for He knows all I want or care is to save Flora's life, and He wouldn't do it, for spite. If I had prayed before, it would be different. If I had gone often to the feet of the Savior with petitions for the pardon of my sins, and an acceptance of my contrition as an atonement for my many transgressions, why, I would be in a condition to ask still greater favors of Him." They walked into the kitchen, from which Richard went to the sick chamber. Monday had gone, and Tuesday came, and with it increas- ing sorrows and waning hope. Flora was perfectly resigned'to her fate, and not a sigh of regret ever escaped her. She was going home, to live with Christ, where sin, and sorrow, will never come. She looked in pity upon the red and weeping faces of her friends; and told them not to weep for her, but rather for themselves; that they were not going, but were to stay a little longer, to endure the trials and suffer- ings of earth. " O, how happy I shall be in a short time, with a golden harp within my hand, and a crown of everlasting glory upon my brow, and words of continual praise, in melody spoken, forever issuing from my mouth." To die such a death is the privilege of those who believe in the Lord, who accept his word, and follow its precepts. It is a death we all may   FLORA AND JOHNNY YOUNG.         415 envy, for the sting of bitterness is gone, and the cold, silent grave is shorn of all its hideous terrors. She looked upon it, not as a ca- laity we should shun, but as a privilege we should be glad to em- brace. A knock is heard, and little Johnny Young comes in to see his kind Flora, whom he had heard was not expected to live. She was told little Johnny wished to see her, and she said,- "Of course, I will see all, as long as I can." He was already at the. bedside, and as he saw her wasted cheeks and sunken eyes he could hardly believe she was the same Flora who had p'ayed so long with him, and had taught him the lessons of salvation. His eyes flooded with tears, and rolled down his cheeks, as he took her thin, white hand, which she kindly extended towards him. He took it in both his hands, and pressed it to his lips, and said, - "O, Miss Flora, I'm so sorry you are goin' to die. I pray to God every day, every hour,-all the while I'm prayin'. Thinkin' pray, ou know, and wishing God would spare her who is so good, and kind to me. O, dear,.I don't know what I shall do for somebody to teach me the way   . to go," said he, sobbing. "' You must pray to God often for guidance and encouragement, and He will be to you, and to all who ask him, the kindest friend. Do not be afraid, but kneel often, and in humbleness of heart thank Him for life, health, food, raiment, and all the blessings of life. Hie bestows them upon all alike, the good and the bad, and yet how few thanks He receivesfor all His favors!" She put her hand upon his head, which was bowed down with weep- ing and sorrow upon -the bed, and said,. "  O, Lord, bless this, thy young servant, and make him to do Thy work, of 'forwarding the cause of righteousness among men, and of redeeming many from the paths of sin and wickedness, into those of truth and holiness." He rose, and took the hand, and again kissed it, saying,- "Good by, Miss Flora. I'm so sorry to leave you, for I know I, shall never see you no more. You look so bad, so death-like, that I I wish I could go instead of you, because you can do so much better than I can, and I be so young and naughty," he ended, weeping. Flora said good by, and they parted forever. It was night. The weather was scold and blustering. The streets were deserted, exicept now and then a solitary pedestrian was on his way home from the club-room or an evening's carousal; or some kind and loving sister was wending her way to sit with a friend now lying   "6        LOVE ON THE WING. upon the brink of the grave. This last was Margaret Stephens, who, wrapped closely round, and escorted by no cavalier, slowly plodded her way through the snow, and against the pitiless storm. She often reeled from the effects of a rough blast of wind, which blew so hard that one could hardly take breath.  She reached the door at last, and, as she entered, sank into the near- est chair from sheer exhaustion. "Why, bless my soul! it's Margaret, out in this awful night! Why, it is a wonder you didn't freeze!" exclaimed Mrs. Lovell, as she un- wrapped the long scarf which hid her countenance completely from the eyes as well as from the rude wind, which, in ungenteel familiarity, played in wanton freaks about her face. "Yes, I thought I would come over to-night, for I heard she was worse, and was not expected to live until morning. I will do all I can, and if that is not much, I will be company for those who do the work." "O, indeed, we are very glad to have you come, for it is so lonesome all night for little Helen to be up; and I can do but little nights, I'm so tired from the work of the day, for somebody must work where any eat." "Yes, I thought you would all be tired to death from the increased labor which Flora's sickness necessarily required. As soon as 1 get warm I will go in," said Margaret, moving up to the stove, and put- ting her feet upon the hearth. Mrs. Lovell stood beside her, with her hand upon the back of the chair, wondering how she could leave her comfortable home on such a night, and go to the bedside of a dying orphan. She was so unselfish, so good and kind, without even the hope of a reward. It was magnanimous in her. Anangel from heaven would not do more, and might do less. The consolation of having such a friend would-do much towards reviving the drooping co rage of Flora, who had already lost,or rather had, given up all hope f iver rising from her bed.              ,  )  '  She arose, and went into the sickroom. Richard met her, ith such, a mournful look of concentrated sorrow, that she pitied hi from the bottom of her heart. He was suffering far more than Flora, and his look would startle any one, because of its ghastliness. He looked more like a ghost than a human being, and he said, in a sepulchral voice, as he extended a hand of welcome, - "O, Margaret! you have come; yes, you have come. And it is a cold and boisterous night for a lonely traveller to go forth voyaging upon unknown and trackless seas, to a bourn of an unknown, unknown extent and place. Could we go with her, the sting of death would be taken away by the consolation of continual presence,"   THE END APPROACHNG.          417 "But no, Richard, we must abide our time, and it will be but a few days when we shall rejoin her," she returned, glancing from his face to that of the sleeper. Helen was arranging things preparatory for the night, and in her oblivious sorrow and Richard's welcome of Margaret, had not noticed her. She now came forward, and in a tearful voice, welcomed her in thankfulness to the home of their dying sister. " O, I don't know what I shall do without her, she was so good and kind to me," said she, sobbing, as she fell upon her neck. "Never mind, Helen, it is our lot, and let us nerve ourselves anew, girding on the armor of our Savior, with the helmet of His righteous- ness, and press on,. hoping for the best," said she, holding her in her arms, and kissing her face, bathed continually in affliction's most bit- ter tears. Helen sat up the night previous, and was much exhausted; but she would not retire, unless assured they would call her if there was a change. She retired early. Mrs. Lovell came in, and sat a while, when she retired, leaving Margaret alone with the sick, while Richard promised to lay upon the lounge in the kitchen. Her uncles, Isaac and William, had called several times, and ex- pressed their sympathy for their sick niece. Ellen, and Sophia, and Francia had also called there, the day previous, and but once before. These had left abundance of sympathy and protestations of love, and if any help was needed, they would gladly assist. Sarah was busy pre- paring her third bridal trousseau, and she rejoiced in the prospect, thinking she was not dependent upon the smiles of William for a' wealthy husband. Thus while death is staring one memberof a family in the face, another is preparing to enter upon the most eventful stage in life's strange theatre. . The loom that weaves the bridal garments, weaves also those of the grave, the one to adorn an earthly bride, the other to crown a heavenly angel. Such is life. Draw your own .con- clusions, and live on.  Flora slept at intervals, and when awake, at times was delirious. Her flowing hair lay tangled upon her brow and pillow. The golden tresses had been often arranged in braids by Helen's indulgent care, though her patience was taxed to the utmost by Flora's delirious efforts to prevent it. Richard sat upon one side, and Margaret upon the other, watching closely each movement of her features; and as each had nothing to say and nothing to do, they sat in silence and waited. She opened her eyes, gave a convulsive start, and settled back again to disturbed re- pose.' They sat thus perhaps an hour, perhaps longer, the watch upon   "8        LOVE ON THE WING. the stand exactly told, but no one consulted it until near the prescrip- tive hour. Richard, weary at last from watching, and exhausted from continual vigils, told Margaret he would lie down a moment if she would call him when she wanted help. She told him "Yes," but it was with a look that half unsettled his purpose; but when she assured him she would not be lonely, he went out to weep in silence and alone. He sobbed and slept in snatches some little while, but every little noise startled him up in surprise, and when persuaded it was nothing but a mouse in the wall, or the grating of the boughs against the house, he lay down again to sleep.          . The name of Richard was plainly heard, though by feeble, startled lips. He rose, and in his haste and confusion sought every door but the right one, and he came near precipitating himself down cellar. At last he struck a light, and found where he was. He found the door, and in a moment stood beside the dying girl. He -was convinced-that but a few moments remained. He called to Helen, and no reply. He called louder, and no reply. What could be the matter? He would see. In fear and trembling he ascended to her room, the door of which was left open. He carefully entered, and found that she was so sound asleep that all the noise of bedlam would hardly awake her. So marked was the contrast between the life-like beauty of the one and the death-like paleness of the other, that he stood a moment unre- solved whether to wake her or not. From such innocence and purity to wake to such woe, though the traces of tears were visible upon her cheeks and the pillow! One hand lay under her cheek, and the other across, just within the covering, while her jet black hair lay in curling tresses'upon her face and pillow. He left the light on the stand, and stepped back outside the door, so she w uldn't be frightened by his presence, and called still louder yet. She awoke, and started, thinking the house was on fire; but he re- assured her, and said, "Flora wishes to see you." "Is she worse?" asked she, her eyes staring wildly. "She wishes to see you about the medicine, and you had better come down," said he, withdrawing. He found Margaret impatiently awaiting his return, who was trying to quiet her into stillness by kind words, and at times by pettish ones. When Richard came, they both coaxed her into consciousness, and she quietly took the cordial, which Margaret had endeavored to administer so long. Mrs. LbveIl was called, and soon they all stood round the   DEATH OF FLORA.           419 dying bed, to witness the last expiring breath of one who in life was dearest, yet in death was most resigned. She said nothing, could say nothing, yet she looked and recognized all with a smile, which, but for its nearness to the grave, would have been pleasant: they all accepted it as in welcome, and pitied and loved her, who could only smile in death.  She took the hand of each, and bade them all adieu; and Richard's she held longest, looking vacantly into his face, as if she would speak, yet could not. Her lips moved, and Richard bent low down to catch the faintest whisper, yet could distinguish no intelligible sound. Rich- ard whispered, - "O, that I could hear one word, I, too, would be willing to die, and 'go with you!" he exclaimed, while tears were streaming down his face. Helen stood on the opposite side with Margaret, bowed down with grief and sorrow. Flora took her hand, and tremblingly put it inside Richard's, held them as firmly as her feeble strength would permit, while her lips moved as if in prayer, or blessing upon a union she would solemnize, with one foot on earth, while her soul was in heaven. Flora was dead! Richard's and Helen's hands were locked together a mofnent beneath the chilling hand of death. Helen withdrew hers, and shudderingly sank upon her knees by the bed, weeping. She covered the cold hands of her sister with tears andlkikses, now looking up,' to see if perchance another breath had come. But, no; the lamp of life had burned quite out, and nothing now remained of all that was once so. dear but the casket in which reposed the jewel,-the richest, the best earth ever produced. It crowned her life with love; and it might, if fate had not otherwise decreed, have crowned another; but she was taken to be the bride of Him whom she had served through life so devotedly, so con- sistently, and with such exemplary piety, that all believed her not in- tended for a sublunary sphere, but originally designed for heaven, as the only place fitted to contain so rare a gem. There she is, if any from earth ever there arrive. Richard left them, and they laid her out in her winding sheet, - the habiliments of the grave,-while he returned to the solitude of his room, and there wept tears, not unmixed with sighs, or thoughts of unkindness against God or fate, for having removed from him, even in the face of his earnest, supplicating entreaty, her, around whom all the delicate tendrils of his heart were entwined. His prayers were not heard, but his sighs and groans could be; and he would mix them with reproaches, that they might ascend together to the ears of an avenging God.    A420        LOVE ON THE WING. The preacher took for his text, "I am the resurrection and the life; whoso' believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live." All were deeply impressed with the argumentative illustrations which were brought forward to prove, not only the soul's immortality, but also a life- of blissful happiness for those who die in the Lord. All wish to die thus. All wish to enjoy, to the fullest extent, the redeeming love of His mercy; but how could they, when their minds forbade the access of such religious truths! If the mind is not so constituted as to be capa- ble of receiving religious truth, why is the owner of that mind answer- able'for not believing what was right he should, but what God had not prepared his mind for, in order that it might believe? .God, not he, is answerable. As'the machine is made, so it will work; neither should it be destroyed because it does not work different from what the archi- tect designed. Man is the work, and God is the builder. From uncon- scious clay he reared him, as the potter forms the vessel, with the mud in his hand. And why is the former more responsible than, the latter? Both are clay, and both, when old and useless, are thrown away, and to the dust return. But because God breathed into man the breath of life, and he became a living soul, should he be destroyed because he does as his-Builder designs? Because he is conscious, independent, and active, shall he be destroyed? God forbid. God is the source whence all living souls spring. And can the stream of humanity always keep on flowing from him to infinity, without exhausting the fountain? We are but scintillations from this fountain, and if we are destroyed, God destroys himself, for we are part of God, or else there is no immor- tality, as that which has no ending, cannot possibly have a beginning, Or is humanity like the ocean, from which the dewdrop is raised in vapor to the clouds, and thence descends in rain, or snow, or dew, to re- freshen and fertilize the earth, that it may produce its fruits in abun- dance for the sustentation of man; and then, when-all the good that can be done with it, flows back again, and is absorbed into the bosom of its source, to be again brought up as before, to again flow back? Are human souls supplied in this way? or is each particle of divinity indi- vidualized, to keep and retain it forever to its glory or to its sorrow? We may think on these questions, yet the riddle is unsolvable still, and will thus remain. But the only consolation there is, is in a Christian's hope. If he is in no danger, he certainly must be safe ; and all who throw themselves implicitly upon the arm of Him who is able and willing to save, are. safe from the dangers of death,- are harbored in a love that is divine, where alone tempestuous seas can never rage, and where all the furies of the deep, black, bottomless pit may rave harmlessly at their feet.                         .   FRED AND SARAH MARRIED.          421 They bore her out to the grave, and there they laid her, where the cold, drifting snow mantled over her. It was .a sunny spot, though now it was cold and dreary. She lay by the side of ler parents, while other sleepers lay thickly around, all unknown to her; yet she was with those who had loved her in her youth; but if they could have seen the full-blown rose, fragrant with the bloom of innocence, purity, and love, they, like others, would have thought it a fit shrine before which to worship. A simple slab marks the resting-place, and on it are inscribed, in bold relief, these words:  FLORA. Born, July 10, 1850., Died, February 26, 1869. And beneath, these words:- The fairest flower that blooms Is foremost in decay; And the prizes we love dearest, Are the first to pass away. CHAPTER LVI. MARRIAGE OF FRED AND SARAH.-RICHARD AND HELEN. FREDERIC and Sarah were married in March following, which Margaret unwillingly and sorrowfully witnessed; but the wedded couple were very much pleased. The bridal party started off int high spirits, because of the promising future which awaited them. They started on a western tour, intending to touch at Chicago, Salt Lake, Omaha, thence back to St. Louis, thence down the river to New Orleans, and from there by steamer to Washington, and thence y rail to Baltimore and Philadelphia, and thence to New York. But this programme was interfered with somewhat for lack of funds. They started with more than sufficient; but, by unwise management, twenty- five thousand dollars slipped away before Salt Lake was reached, and more had to be sent by their sister for their return. The tour was one continued drunken frolic. He would stop at every city, spending thou- sands in nightly debaucheries. She remonstrated, but it was of no avail; he would have his fun,-for one did not marry every day. But before the 36   422        LOVE ON THE WING. funds arrived, the landlord was about to seize their trunks as a colat- eral security, and turn them into the streets of Deseret. The money arrived, of which she took, possession, paid their bills, and returned more sorry, if not more wise, than when they started. It was not all gone yet. The next instalment would be more profit- ably expended, for she would get it into her hands, and would do with it what she wished. We shall see, though not in this book. Those who come after us can take up the story where it is left, and give the public the benefit of the examples of these our worthy heroes. Spring came and went as usual, but to- Richard and Helen it was the saddest they had ever known. The sun shone as brightly, the flow- ers bloomed as beautifully, the birds sang as sweetly, and all Nature looked as gay as ever. They perceived them all, though their hearts were so clouded over with sorrow that they could not enjoy them. Summer came, in all its glorious beauty, flooding the world with light, and scattering flowers on every hand. Nature smiled too sweetly for the sorrowing heart to mourn always, and before the summer had gone they allowed themselves to drift into the channels of ordinary daily life, without, however, feeling that gayety of spirit 'and lightness of dis- position, which, before the death of Flora, were so remarkable. Richard busied himself at work for William as before, coming home every Saturday evening. Helen attended school, and received music lessons from Miss -- , as she had done before. Every Saturday even- ing she played some of her most difficult pieces, for Richard to see the rapid progress she was making. One of these was a Morceau from Linda, which she rendered very well, but with not so much ease as in after years; Casta-Diva was another: and she practised upon them, and others, until she had the satisfaction of hearing her musical pro- ficiency praised as being without an equal in the village. Richard was very much gratified with the progress she had made, and he encouraged her with the most flattering compliments. Sometimes he came home earlier than usual, and they, in company of a schoolmate, took a sail on the lake. Such excursions tended to drive away the gloom which overshadowed them; and at no other time were their minds completely oblivious of sorrow, though occasionally, as the mind involuntarily recalled the past, a shade would pass over their faces, and again as quickly disappear. After returning, they sat within the ivy-bound arbor, and recounted the happiness thus spent upon the clear, glassy lake. Evenings thus enjoyed flew swiftly away, to be numbered with sadder memories of the past, though, not like others, they could be recalled without a pang.   RICIIARD'S SYMPATHY WITH HELEN.        423 Such excursions, with all their attendant incidents, are painted indel. ibly upon the tablet of the memory, The slip of a f.:ot upon the bow, as we disembark, is recalled with pleasure, perhaps too with a smile, at the thought of having escaped a ducking, and perhaps with a shudder, for having escaped it so narrowly. The tipping of the boat, as she tacks, perhaps splashing a wave over the top, frightening leginners, is recalled with pleasure; and often in after years the story is told to anxious children, huddliig close up to your knees by the fire, and who clap their little hands in joy to think you escaped so cleverly. The crown- ing, too, of a dear friend with water lilies, mixed with japonica blos- soms, is an incident which, with all its particulars are stamped upon the impressible mind of youth. The thankful voice, the joyful laugh, the happy song, as it is wafted to the distant shore, are pleasantly associated with the more irksome tasks of the school-room. The sad-  dest, no doubt, is the thought that these days are never again to re- turn to us; but the reflection that our children - if ever we are thus fortunately blessed- may enjoy the same, takes away a little of the dreariness which our increasing cares and years impose. Whenever Richard was at home, he was with Helen, either stroll- ing leisurely in the garden, or walking upon the sandy beach. They gathered wild flowers, and wove them into wreaths, with which to crown Ilelen's brow; or they searched upon the sandy shore for the curiously- wrought shells which the waves were continually washing up. In the longer evenings he assisted her in her lessons, bending studiously over the same slate, and watching with intense interest the solving of a difficult example, either in algebra or geometry; or some difficult pas- sages in Pollok's Course of Time had been parsed differently at school than Helen thought proper-she laid them before Richard, and ac- cepted his analysis, whether agreeing with her own or not, as being worthy of confidence. Not a word had been said by either, of the mysterious union of hands in the dying clasp of Flora's. Each thought the other had forgotten the incidet, or had not deemed it worthy of serious consideration. They regarded each other simply as brother and sister; and if any other thought ever crowded itself upon their, minds, it was repulsed with a reluctant sigh by Richard, .who would gladly entertain such hopes, if he could with impunity; but he feared that Helen would either not second them, or else would, be a sacrifice on some altar, and he was loath to bring any more trouble on her who had suffered so much. She recounted all her trials at school to him every Saturday evening, with as much confidence and trust as if he were indeed her   424        X LOVE ON THE WING. brother, and in this --light she regarded him. If any-schoolmate was rude, she sought counsel of him. If any betrayed her confidences,he asked him how she should return the unkindness; whether s e-ould resent or not, or regard it as if nothing had occurred, To all such queries Richard listened most attentively, and advised her as to the best course to pursue; Richard was something of a connoisseur in painting, in drawing, and in writing, having taught them in his younger days, and of him she received her lessons, he, in the early winter months remaining at home on purpose to teach her these arts. She painted some very beautiful Oriental pieces, of large size, under his instruction. The Grecian oil painting was an art not so difficult to. acquire, but still an accomplishment not unworthy the attention of the student. She executed several very fine pieces, which now adorn the walls of the library. In this she was proficient, for her taste of colors enabled her -to select with correctness the various shades required upon a Grecian picture. Chirography was also an art by itself, which she acquired wholly from Richard, he having given the first lessons she received. She was con- stantly reminded of the usefulness of a good knowledge of it, by ob- serving the specimens of penmanship which adorned the walls of Rich- ard's room. Pictures of the useful animals, as well as those of the forest, were delineated with a boldness and fidelity truly astonishing; and after seeing these, she returned with renewed courage to the task of copying more closely the line on the top of the page, in the hope that in time she might rival the productions of her. teacher. Drawing required a great deal of patience and study, but she mas- tered it by perseverance, so she could execute beautifully some of the most difficult subjects in nature with great accuracy. Unflagging dili- gence was a quality which most girls of her light and airy disposition rather shun than court; hut it was natural for her to love study, or employment of some kind. If not busy over some of her studies, she found recreation in the garden among the flower-beds, either removing the intruding weeds with a hoe, or training a drooping vine, or support- ing a drooping flower; ,but in the winter her time was all consumed in mastering her lessons. Often Richard, as he guided her little hand upon the canvas, ex- perienced a peculiar emotion, not unmixed with that .finer and more subtile feeling, which to a brother's heart is foreign; and while the crimson color mantled his check, she remained insensible and indiffer- ent. Her innocent heart never thrilled to such emotions, and if she   RICHARD IN LOVE WITH HELEN.          425 had dreamed of any hope- entertained by Richard, she would hardly have permitted that familiarity Which his presence as teacher seemed to excuse. He often sat by her side, his arm across the back of her chair, watch- ing her as she carefully touched this place with a lighter color, or darkened that, while he was more absorbed in the living picture by his side, than the soulless one before her; and often when addressed as to the propriety of adding a certain color, he would have to be roused from his reverie, by her turning hei head suddenly around, and again repeating the question. And to herquestion  y arou hy h was a btractewere     to rehler- questaion as to why he was so abstracted, he replied, - "O, I was only thinking- thinking of some business, to be trans- acted on the following day." And, then, after giving an opinion, he relapsed again into reverie, perhaps saddened by the recollection of her who had but a short time before been the glory of his life. The bitter cup of sorrow might have been sweetened by the hope that she who sat by his side, unconscious of such feelings, would fill the place left vacant by her death. Howcould he mention it -she, to whom such -emotions were as foreign and as distant as the snow-clad Alps P When drawing, she bent so low, her curls lay in massive tresses upon the paper, which Richard twined round the pencil he held in his hand, ready to assist at a second's notice; but he would rather she would not trouble him while he was so pleasantly employed. Thus hours passed away, to both unheeded; and to Richard they were as halipy as any he had ever experienced. Before he was aware of it, he' was loving Helen, not with that lukewarm, brotherly love, but with a strong, heartfelt, sincere, devoted love; a love, too, which could not be shaken by her little fretful foibles, which she sometimes manifested when her patience was beginning to give away because of his abstracted manner. It was a great study to him how he should introduce this subject to her attention, and still retain a hold on her affections as a brother; for he was afraid he might; in wishing too much, lose what he already' pos- sessed. The confidence she now reposed in him was sweeter than any love he had ever received. Indeed, he was not sure of ever receiving any, for Flora had never given a verbal proof of it, and he rather thought, on the whole, and perhaps the facts in the case will bear him out in it, that at first she did not care for him; and at last she only gave that mute assent, which, coming at such a time, and under such circumstances, would look as if she regarded it but as a resource in a trying extremity. 36*   426        LOVE ON THE WING. He was very kind and attentive to Helen, and he showed, in many and various ways, the love he had not yet declared, and dare not, lest she should in some mysterious way be snatched from him, or lost, as all, in some way'or another, had been. Winter had already come, and Richard, having not much on hand, thought he would devote himself exclusively to this star of his glory, and if she escaped from him, it should be no fault of his. When she skated, he was by her side, neither was he willing she should ride on the boat, for fear something might happen. He was not easy if she was exposed to any danger, however remote. The dangers of ordinary life were enough for him, without incurring any other. He watched her, as she tripped gayly about the house, with feelings of love, fear and hope; and if she were longer absent from him than he thought necessary, he was uneasy, and he feared that something might happen to her that pwould endanger his hopes, which now were wrought up by his love to a fervent heat. He rose each morning with the resolve to mention in -some way, either direct or indirect, his love for her; and as each opportunity slipped by, he thought another time would do as well- at noon, or in the evening. He would mention it some time when she was drawing, or perhaps when she was painting would be a better time.  He had formed the'words already, but somehow or another whenever he intimated it, she seemed so abstracted or indifferent to any allusions he made, that he feared she purposely barred her mind to the recep- tion of any hint he might make. If this was the case, there was no use  of his saying a word; but perhaps she didn't understand it. It would not do to give it up so. He wouldn't give it up; he would venture at all hazards. -She might entertain some such thought; no, she couldn't, he knew she couldn't; for if she had, some intimation of itwould have been made. Could she cloak her feelings thus, ahd 'not let fall one single ray of light from the star which shone so brilliantly round the horizon of his existence No, it could not be. She was guiltless of love, that love of which Richard's heart was filled to overflowing, but which he dare not mention. He wished it was summer, for then so much better opportunities were presented to him. He could speak of it in the garden, as they picked the flowers; or beneath the vine-clad bower, as they watched the waves rippling at their feet. He sighed in win for such a chance, for .it was winter. He wondered why he had not thought of it before, when they sat thus alone; or as they strolled leisurely through the garden, plucking the fairest flowers, and clipping the withered ones, to.   RICHARD  SEEKS AN OPPORTUNITY.        427 let fall upon the ground, with the little switch he cut from the lilac bush,.and with which he used to tickle her nleck, on the sly, to see her start and scream, thinking it was a horrid spider; and when she ap- pealed to him to brush it off, he assured her, after brushing, that there was nothing to brush away. But she wouldn't believe it, for something had. touched her neck, khe knew, and it felt just like. a spider. One morning he rose with the determination to mention it that day, before he returned to that bed; and he pointed to the place from which he had risen, with a chuckle in his voice, while his manner indicated that fear predominated over hope. The words he had selected had . been many times accepted as being fit and proper, and as often rejected, because of some defect, either imaginary or real. He thought, too, that it would be better to let his words be dictated by that love of which his heart was full and bursting for utterance. The eloquence of love springing spontaneously from the seat and source of all the pas- sions, would have far more effect upon her young and susceptible heart than all the studied phrases science might suggest; still it was well enough to select words expressive of his meaning, and not leave her in doubt as to his wishes. She wouldn't take any hints, for Richard had repeatedly tried them, and nothing but the plain, outspoken words would satisfy her and convince him, either of the uselessness of further thoughts on the subject, or else the crowning of his happiness by the acceptance of that love. It was a great venture; but if he won her, it must be made. She was singular, and in this respect very remarkable; for, unlike any other similar case, when hints were broached, they were responded to as having been understood; but Helen never manifested, by any word or sign, that she had the least conception of what he was driving at. One of two things was certain, that either she did not care a fig for him, and she would cool him into silence by mute contempt, or else she knew him so well, and possessed such a clear insight into his char- acter, that she could trust him implicitly, knowing to a certainty that she and she alone possessed his entire, undivided love, and that he was only waiting for, what he termed, a favorable opportunity to declare it to her, and'ask her to become his wife. She had determined that not one sign of approbation should he receive from her, unless, indeed, she saw him wandering away to other shrines; and he had half determined several times to do this very thing, hoping he would thus be enabled to coerce her into some intimation of her willingness to accept the proffer of his love. But no, he couldn't do it, not even for such a purpose. He could not play the hypocitte. He could not love where he didn't. ,                   . ,  v   428        LOVE ON THE WING. lie could not forsake her whom he did love, even by an act so harm- less; but he would rather allow himself to suffer all the terrors of an uncertain suspense, than to be the cause of one moment of pain to her, whom he now felt he did truly love. No, he would await his time; and a few weeks or months were nothing, so long as he eventually ac- quired the object of his heart. She possessed far more insight into character than he did, although she was so young, notwithstanding the advantages of his age and ex- perience. Strange that this apparently simple-minded girl could thus hold his strong heart in subjection to her silent will. Yet thus it was. You would think her no more than a girl, as she sat of a sunmmer even- ing, arrayed in pure, unrelieved white, before the piano, drumming list- lessly its ivory keys; but when she sang, you knew then she was more than a girl, and, I had almost written, more than a lady. -Her penetra- tion was, certainly, of riper years. Richard was resolved to find out the worst, and know his destiny. He could but fail, and he might succeed; at any rate, a downright rejection would not be so harrowing as the awful suspense he had en- dured, though protesting now these four months. His affliction, from little, grew each day worse and worse, until it had become perfectly in- tolerable to him. He could neither eati sleep, nor live comfortably with her, in such an uncertain relation to him continually on his mind. He must know, and so with his heart palpitating in his mouth, he sat down by the table upon which were her drawing materials, books, pa. pers, and paints. It was this study in which they, had spent many hours together; and as he sat down, more clumsily than usual, she looked up from her drawing, and at the sight of his face, exclaimed, - "Why, Richard, what is the matter? you look like a ghost. What has frightened you?  * O, it's nothing, only I was a little startled at seeing the cat dissect a rat in the wood-house just now. Don't you believe she deliberately tore the bleeding, quivering flesh into shreds, as if she delighted to see the helpless thing suffer so in her claws. At last she came to the heart, and without wounding it, she took it out, and laid it carefully down upon the step, and she watched with pleasurable delight its still quiv- ering pulsations," said he, with a sigh. "Why, Richard, how cruel that cat must be! I must see it, for it must be worthy our attention to see one creature so cruel to another," said she, rising, as, white and startled as himself, she hastened to the door of the wood-house, and there, sure enough, was the cat and the rat which Richard had just placed thef, all dissected, and which the cat was now trying to devour.   HELEN'S HUMANITY.            429 She looked in alarming wonder upon that cruel cat, as she devoured, with a look of much satisfaction, the still quivering fibres of an insensi- ble rat. "Why, does it make you shudder at the sight of such wanton cru- elty?" asked he, as she turned disgusted from the scene, and the two returned hand in hand to the table whence they had risen. "Why, yes; I think it is the most shocking thing I ever saw! And how dreadful must have been the sufferings of that poor creature!" she returned, shiveringly, while on her face was depicted all the ago- nizing feelings which a rat in such circumstances would be supposed to suffer. "You seem to pity that rat very nruch, - his untimely and terrible end," said he, his countenance but slightly changed from the sickening pallor of a few moments before. "Why, yes; why shouldn't I? The poor thing! how it must have suffered!" said she, wonderingly, noticing him closely, as he sat drum- ming listlessly'upon the table with his pencil, while he tried his best to keep his countenance horrified as long as possible, in which he but partially succeeded. "If you had seen the poor rat suffering all those untold tortures. which a living dissection would inflict, would you have interposed a hand to save its life or mitigate its sufferings?" he asked, without look- ing up. "No, not to save its life; but I would to prevent such dreadful tor- ture," she returned, as her face contracted into a scowl. "In Cuba they torture human beings to death, in order to make them disclose their confederates. Would you, if it lay in your powe, shve a fellow-being from the horrors of such a dissolution?" he asked, composedly, as he leaned back in his chair. "Most certainly I would, and that too without a moment's thought," she returned, decidedly. Now was Richard's time, if ever; and so moving his chair closer, as if to get a better view of the picture she was trying at times to work upon, but the repeated applications of the rubber, and some impatient marks she had made, showed she was a little excited by the rat or something. He took her dimpled hand, which was lying carelessly upon the table, with its single ring on the middle finger, and pressed it to his lips, while she only blushed, and exclaimed,  "Why, Richard! How dare you!" "You pity that rat; but for me, you have not one sympathizing word. That poor rat, as you say, suffered probably about two minutes,   430        LOVE ON THE WING. while I have suffered, more than as many months, pain far more acute than can possibly attend the dissolution of so little a thing. I still live and suffer, while that rat is dead, and yet for the latter you have more sympathy than for the former. How strange and inexplicable is the human heart!" be exclaimed, not observing much change in her face, which was now raised from the picture. "If you will tell me for what you have suffered, I could perhaps sym- pathize with you. But not knowing that you had been suffering, what can be expected from me? The sufferings of that rat were real, and perhaps yours are imaginary," said she, her eye sparkling with a mis- chievous twinkle, which he had never before observed. "No, not unless the heart belies itself. My sufferings have been as real as those of the rat, and I fear they will continue, if you do not put forth your hand and prevent the gnawing which has been so long and slowly, but surely, eating away the tendrils of my heart. May I be bold, and tell you the whole?" "Yes," Helen murmured, as a crimson flush mantled her cheeks. "I have loved you long and well, and have sought on many occa- sions to impart to you what. I thought would be unwelcomed news; but my fear has thus far triumphed over my love, and now I seek that relief from a suspense which becomes more and more intolerable as your continued indifference increases. Say, Helen, say you will be mine, and fill the place in my heart made vacant by dear Flora's death," he said, tremulously, still holding her hand, while he looked such a loving, yet doubtful glance at her, that she, pitying the suffering of which she. had been the unconscious cause, bowed her head, and sighed. 8he remained in silence a moment, and then raising her head,-- and Richard, like a prisoner at the bar, lookedanxious, doubtful as to what his sentence would be, - said,- "It is too sudden, Richard,and I did not expect it. Let me think upon it, and by and by I will tell you," said she, assuming a look of firmness and gravity, without a mixture of returning love or sympathy. An older and more experienced judge could not have wielded the in. signia of his high office with more decision. "Helen, this is not the language of love, and you look so grave and dignified that I hardly hope my sentence will be lenient. I thought and feared as much. I believed you. could not love me, for others couldn't; and I've tried so hard to win it, yet couldn't. I am so rough and coarse that no one can like me, however much I may try to merit it. But it would make me so happy, and I should feel that all my sor- rows and afflictions were administered for the purpose of refining and   RICHARD PREVAILS.           431 purifying my nature, thus making me more receptive of those gentle infliences which, like the fragrance of the rose, always hover around you." He bowed his head upon his arm, and sat in silence, while tears in- voluntarily flowed, and sighs, which he vainly tried to suppress, came to Helen's ears, who sat pitying the deep love, the kind of which she had not dreamed. O, Richard, don't feel so bad, for it pains me dreadfully to see you suffer so. I have always loved you as a sister should, and do still; but this is so new, so strange, and it requires such a different love, that I know not what to say or think. You have thought, while I have not. You wouldn't like to marry aniunlovingwife, or one who loves you only as a sister; and as such I do love you, for you have been as good and kind to me as any brother," said she, returning more sympathy than she had ever done. He looked up, and wiping the tears from his face, said,- "Your sisterly love I have always prized, above all other possessions, and second to nothing, unless, indeed, it is the love I now seek and vainly crave. If I could only get this, I should be satisfied. If I could only persuade you to like me, as- I love even ever so little, I should deem myself supremely blessed. But no, you will not trust me, even when my heart's most devoted and sincere declarations are uttered in all the impassioned eloquence of my soul. Do, Helen! yield, and give yourself up to me. Lean upon my arm, whose strength, while life shall last, shall not faint nor weary of the loving burden it sup- ports; and even if it should become palsied by time and age, the love which prompts it, and the will which commands it, will never weaken or die. These are eternal, and will never flag. Should you accept, I should feel encouraged to gird on anew the armor of worldly ambition, and press oil through the buffeting waves of life; but with- out this cheering solace, I should .ink down and despair. You can pre- vent this, and make me ten times more useful to the world and myself. Think how much I have suffered, and relent. Be to me what I have sought from others, and even your own beloved sister. She, by the mysterious union of our hands, in her own dying clasp, sanctions it. For her sake, for mine, for your own, accept. Place yourself in the position-she would have occupied had life permitted. You smile. I knew I could make an impression on your heart. You are mine, are you not? Yes, I know you are." He concluded, and- as he was about to embrace her, she drew off and said, -   432        LOVE ON THE WING. "O, no; wait a little while, and then - and then. You know I must answer s6mething, for silence is consent. I will tell you what I will do. If I don't say anything between this and to-morrow evening, at six o'clock,.you may consider it as accepted. Will you agree ,to it?" "Well, yes, if it is the best that can be done; but I would rather hear it now," said he, his eye brightening at the thought of a wily strat- agem which immediately presented itself to his mind, and that was to absent himself entirely until after the time specified, and then--and then, it would be sealed. "Well, you can expect it without fail, and you must be here, or else I shall retract what I have already conceded," said she, firmly. Richard's brow darkened, but he said nothing, and soon after they rose from the table and separated. CHAPTER LVII. MARRIAGE OF RICHARD AND HELEN. - CONCLUSION. T HE answer that Richard didn't hear the nex evening was, though unuttered, still plain. They met at six o'clock, while his inquiring look, and her answering reply, were stamped upon their faces.. He took her in his arms, and kissed her tenderly. It was the seal of a happy b'etrothal; and as she leaned most lovingly her head upon his bosom, tears of joy ran down her cheeks, which Richard kissed away. They were married in the month of January, 1870.. A few of her most intimate -friends were invited, none of the Woods being present. None had raised any objections to it; as it was esteemed a mere love match between two poor love-smitten individuals, and consequently was not worthy of that attention which would have been bestowed upon them had they been rich. If they were satisfied, it was enough. Wil- liam, of course, raised no objections, because he was fully persuaded that he could no longer hope for him.. Bridget's doom was,sealed from the evening on which she made the last proposal. The bride was dressed in a pale blue silk, with point lace collar, and her hair being so luxuriant, required no addition to it to arrange in a splendid heavy chignon, while over each eye hung two tiny ringlets. Margaret was there, and assisted her in arranging her toilet, and she- pronounced her, just before she took the arm of Richard, the most   MARRIAGE OF RICHARD AND HET E'N.        433 resplendently-beautiful bride she ever saw approach the hymeneal font; and, indeed, she was - she was most beautiful. As Richard came in to conduct her down, he could hardly recognize her as his own affianced bride. She smiled at his timidity, and advancing a step, threw herself into his arms. He caressed her tenderly, and kissed her brow, saying, - "Helen, it is the happiest moment of all my life, ay, not excepting one single hour. I would not for worlds have one iota of the trouble, disappointment, and sorrow blotted out of the past, if by so doing one jot or one tittle of my present happiness should be denied me. The joy of the present, turns all the past into sweetness; and I am far happier' now for the sanctifying influences of the sorrow through which I have gone. Do stand up,.and let me see you; you are so radiantly beautiful, that I fear you may vanish like a spirit of the mist from my sight. Come, I dare not trust you long, for fear some more daring rival may snatch you away and leave me alone. Let us have the knot tied, so you cannot be torn from me. No, I won't let you go alone, but lean on my arm -there, that's the way." She took one arm, and Margaret the other, and thus the trio descended the stairs; and in the parlor a company was anxiously waiting for them. They were married early in the evening, and proceeded on a western trip, intending to go no farther west than Chicago, she wishing, above all things, to revisit the scenes of her childhood. She wished to stroll again in the yard, and pluck the flowers that were growing so luxuri- antly on all sides; to listen to the music of the fountain, as the wa- ters fell in sparkling crystals into the basin. They arrived there in due time; and after resting a few days, they paid a visit to her father's home. As soon as she came within sight, a tear glistened in her eye, which she brushed quickly away. She stepped lightly from the carriige, and walked, in measured solemnity, through the paths over which she had once, in the lightness of her heart, tripped gayly. Since then she had^drunk from the cup of bitterness every sorrow, and with it but little of the nectar of life had been mixed. Here she was on the threshold of the home of her youth. The same sky wab above her head. The air breathed the same, and all the surroundings were the same, but yet how different were her feelings. Then she was an innocent, prattling girl, now a happy bride, and look- ing the future in the face withoqt a shudder. They returned to their hotel happier, though more sad than when they left it a few hours before. The next morning they resolved to go to Taylor, Brown, and Lee, her father's solicitors for many years, and who had taken upon themselves the labor of contesting the validity of claims -37    434        LOVE ON THE WING. others had upon some real estate, now in the heart of the city,"and which they believed rightly belonged to Mr. Bentley. The suit had been pending in chancery for ten long, weary years, and they were about to give it up in despair, they having spent large sums, which they could never hope to receive back, should they fail in establishing the claims of their deceased patron; when, fortunately, an error was discovered in the transmission of the papers to those who claimed and had possession, which cleared the mystery up at once, and the Bentleys were reinstated in all their rights.  Their expenses, of which they kept an accurate account, were twenty- five thousand dollars; but the property, with Pike's Opera House rest- ing on a part of it, and valuable stores on the remainder, was valued at four hundred thousand. And after our young heroes had given satisfactory evidence of Helen's being the only remaining heiress, she was installed in all her rights and possessions. The solicitors were paid, and congratulated upon the untiring assiduity with which they had watched the interests of their client. They were retained in'the same capacity as before, and directed to receive the moneys due the  estate, to be forwarded to Helen upon her application. The happy couple, made thrice more so by this unexpected event, continued on their route to California. Thence they took a steamer to New York, and from there to their humble home, on the shores of the sweet Skaneateles, where the remaining days of their eventful life may, we hope, be passed in quietness and peace. By forestalling the secrets of a few years, we can look forward and see them surrounded by a happy family of smiling, obedient children, ruling them with such mild authority and indulgent wisdom that obe- dience is as involuntary as the love in which they are regarded. We pray that the blessing of God may rest upon them, to shield them from the maledictions of those who think themselves wronged by this aban- donment of Richard. John Huss married in the summer of 1869, to a fair and pretty girl; but not until after Bridgethad tried, and tried in vain, to dissuade him from his purpose. She resorted to every stratagem her feeble sagacity suggested, but in vain, for he would not be put off another day. It was now or never with him. He had waited on her a good while, and now, if she wanted to marry him, was the time. He should marry, if he had to without her, and he did. We wish them much joy; and may the blessings of peace and plenty always hover over them. The splendid home of Sarah was often disturbed by the ribald songs of drunkenness, and the boisterous carryings-on of dissipated   BRIDGET'S DEGRADATION.          435 revelry. Against this her voice had been feebly raised, as well as his sister's, but to no purpose.. His immense wealth was fast disappearing from his control, and' if 'it continues, the time is not distant when they will be reduced to dependence. - The furniture had been. smashed, and the mirrors were broken in his tantrums; and she, while' interposing, had received a terrible blow. upon her face, loosening several teeth, and otherwise disfiguring what was once so lovely, and to which so many had looked for that smile of approval they so much desired. This treatment,. together with the amaurosis, which is now much worse than when mentioned before, is rather more severe than any earthly judge would inflict; but she has seen her happiness and her glory; perhaps also, she' is now experiencing some of the darker shades of life, which fate seems -to have taken much pains to exempt her from heretofore, and also seems to have taken much pleasure in inflicting upon other characters in this most remarkable story. Bridget-is as she was, though the brightness of her glory is some- what dimmed by the prevailing suspicions that she is truly just what she represents herself to be. She moves about with the consciousness that the scorn of everybody is hers, with down-cast eyes, which before looked so impudently at every one. Her voice betokens a tremulous- ness very much akin to sorrow, for having permitted golden opportuni- ties to pass unemployed, and to have selected that path, in her eagerness to place herself upon a grade far above her calling, which leads one lower and lower, to the pit of degradation and misery. William remains the same, shunning rather than courting respectable society. He knows the finger of outraged decency is uplifted against hinm, and its influence tends more to sadden than to enliven his joy. All respectable women have ceased to visit at his house, save his sister, who has nodw taken up her residence with her family there. Whenever he meets a lady, he removes -his 'hat and bows politely, which she deigns not to notice, holding him in that silent and justifiable contempt his conduct so justly merits. Nothing can he ever do to reinstate him- self in their good graces, except he marry, and shun the evil associates of his life. He thinks that it may end well enough yet, though the thought would imply he had some misgivings about it. The thing that ends well enough, no one entertains a thought about. Everybody 'knows there is no doubt of it, and consequently think nothing of it whatever; but it is that about which there is a doubt, when such dubi- ous reflections are entertained. Mrs. Bordman is at her brother's, on the pretext of shielding him from scandalous remarks; but the real cause is, that her exchequer is   436        LOVE ON THE WING. reduced so low as to be unable to supply her demands upon it. If she lives as extravagantly as she has done, the time is not distant when Wil- liam will be reduced to the same pecuniary embarrassment she now. suffers. Mr. Bordman is at the business in which he was set up by the brothers in Buffalo; thus he acquires a respectable living for himself, while his wife and family are depending upon the charity of her brother for even the necessaries, say nothing of the luxuries of life. Her friends and relatives still refuse to visit her, and she has withdrawn all associ- ation from them. She declares, however, that she will live them down, and shame them for their treachery. The end is not yet: and not until the dungeon or a suicide's grave receives its victim, or the gallows its criminal; not until William is reduced to dependence and penury, or the grave, together with his sister and her husband; until all, both friends and foes, repose alike in the hillside cemetery, - not until then let their epitaphs be written. Francia, and Julia, and Margaret, three promising and accomplished young ladies, are unmarried and with these, as future heroines, another book could easily be written; for far more interesting will be the clos- ing scenes of the lives of those whose beginning has commenced so inauspiciously. Should health and leisure permit, we shall be happy, on some future occasion, to write the sequel of a story, which, for the- interests involved, and the irascible tempers of those engaged, cannot fail of making it as amusing as it is instructive. The story is closed, though not finished; and, as we bid adieu to our friends, for whom we have manifested so much interest, we cannot but hope that their future will be more blessed than their past, and that a more mature wisdom will guide their steps into paths their ambition has so long caused them to shun. If the lesson conveyed, by the recital of the wishes and doings of these our worthy friends, to the youth of either sex, shall point out the danger of too great ambition; or, if it shall be the means of throw- ing one ray of hope across the darkened path of the broken-hearted; or, should it stir a holy aspiration in the hearts of those who have as yet seen no sorrow, or while away an idle hour, or refresh the memory of age, - we shall deem ourselves amply repaid for the pleasant toil of happy months.        THE END.
