               THE EMIGRANT SQUIRE.

                     "'THE EMIGRANT SQUIRE,' by the author of 'Bell Brandon,' is the best work of fiction he has ever produced. We are fully persuaded that, in all the essentials of plot, incident, moral, and fidelity to nature, it is one of the very best stories published. It is as original in style as in matter, and entirely free from the namby-pamby stuff that swells out to such interminable length in some of the trashy novelettes that almost weekly come under our notice. Mr. Myers is not only an original thinker, but a humorist of the highest order of merit. There is a vein of humor running through this last production of his, quite equal to any thing that we have ever read from Thackeray, and would do no discredit to the pen of Douglas Jerrold himself. Such a story, amid the trash that is published is truly refreshing. The picture which the author has given us of a vessel caught in an ice-floe, is one of the most graphic, and yet probable to the seeming, that we have ever read. The author shows not only a lively imagination, but a minuteness in narration, and a felicity of expression, that must place him at the very head of the fiction writers of the day. There are few of the old authors capable of producing a more thoroughly original novel, or one that is freer from hackneyed sentimentality, than is 'The Emigrant Squire.' The reader will find that the story increases in interest as it progresses, and nine out of ten we are sure will agree with us, that it is the beet novelette that has ever originally appeared in any newspaper in the United States. It has everywhere been pronounced a story of great merit."

            THE EMIGRANT SQUIRE; 
            OR, THE DILLONS OF DILLONBOROUGH. 
             
               CHAPTER I. 
               DANIEL DILLON was an Englishman, portly and rubicund, but slightly troubled with dyspepsia, hypochondria, poverty, and a propensity to suicide. These enemies were none of them formidable singly, but combined, they formed a powerful alliance against the ease of Daniel, who liked nothing better than sheer quiet comfort, excepting a foxhunt and a good dinner. His poverty was by no means extreme, for he was the owner of a handsome estate, producing about fifteen hundred pounds a year, but inasmuchas eleven hundred and twenty-five pounds ten shillings and sixpence of this sum went annually into the pockets of a little dusty attorney, residing at the next market-town, who held one of those mysterious liens upon the property, called a mortgage, Daniel's part of his own income, was by no means the lion's share. Yet, the residue was not a contepmtible sum, especially when reduced into Yankee dollars, and, as a net income it might be looked upon as something far removed from indigence. Goldsmith's curate was "passing rich" on a tenth of the sum. But Daniel was a, man of large views, and a large family, and four hundred pounds a year was, to him, nothing more nor less than absolute poverty! He sighed over it fifty times a day, and fifty times a day he resolved to retrench his expenses. He actually sold one of his best hunters, one cloudy morning, and on the next day, he bought a brace of a rare breed of hounds with the proceeds of the sale. This did not mend matters much, but it was a beginning. He daily resolved, moreover, to omit his second bottle of post-prandial wine; but, unfortunately, by the time the first was emptied, his views regularly underwent a change, his income becoming wonderfully magnified in his estimation, and all his prospects improving so decidedly cidedly, that he never hesitated on drawing the second cork. 
               Daniel's eldest son was at college, learning Greek and other gimcracks, as he elegantly described his studies, and looking forward, less to academic laurels than to his quarterly vacations, with the freedom of the stable and the kennel; Dick's view halloo was the loudest and most uproarious of all the hunting melodies that ever awoke the echoes of Dillonborough. Four other sons, beef-faced boys of thirteen and downwards, were at school studying the elements; three "finished" daughters, of seventeen and upwards, were at home, embroidering, thrumming the harp, and strumming the piano; while the catalogue of Mr. Dillon's olive-plants was rendered complete by a two-year-old, just learning to toddle, and a baby both literally and figuratively in arms, for the youngest Dillon was as bellicose a fraction of humanity as one would like to encounter. 
               "So far so well," thought Daniel, as he surveyed complacently the rank and file of his domestic light-infantry; "but this must have an end. Betty, I say-" 
               Daniel invoked his wife with the full purpose of telling her of his poverty and his darkening prospects, but her kind, radiant countenance beamed so cheerfully upon him when she answered to his call, that he could not bear to call up a cloud where all was sunshine before, and so he concluded his sentence by inquiring what there was for dinner. He had so long kept the secret of his failing fortunes from his family, that ho could not bear to disclose it now. It would break Betty's heart, and Belinda's, and Clara's and Elsie's and poor Dickey's, besides a multitude of little hearts that ought not yet to be burthened with care. Not a soul of them knew aught about the mortgage incubus which brooded over the estate, nor why the little seedy lawyer came quarterly to the mansion, and was always closeted with its proprietor; nor why Mr. Dillon always appeared so nervous in his presence, and so deferential to him, and so very glad when he was gone. 
               Daniel dined and his spirits rose, but in the evening he had the blues and in the morning the horrors, and so the days passed with little variation, excepting in the degrees of depression and elevation to which his spirits rose and sunk, until November, most sombre of the months in drizzly England, came, and brought with it its usual accession of gloom to the hypochondriacal world. He did not escape its influence, and his harassed mind began to contemplate more seriously than he had ever done before, the idea of escape from his troubles by a voluntary death. His eye wandered often to the coroner's corner of his daily gazette, to read the records of suicides it contained, and he dwelt with painful interest upon the various modes of egress from life adopted by the miserable. But, pistols, poison, the cord and the water, all were exceedingly repulsive to his tastes, and he was astonished to find that there was no genteeler and more agreeable mode of making one's conge to a troublesome world. The more he reflected, the more he became satisfied that the thing could not be done comfortably, and that it only remained for him to choose the least disagreeable method of departure. 
               He revolved the subject for several consecutive days, until one miserably misty morning, his eye fell upon the account of a new mode of self-extinguishment, invented by some genius who should have lived to enjoy the fame of his discovery. 
               "What is simpler than a pan of charcoal?" exclaimed Daniel, "or what is easier to take than a little extra carbonic acid gas? I shall go out like the snuff of a candle!" and his resolution was taken accordingly. Not so the gas, however, which, on trial, proved suffocating in the extreme, and Daniel had always been a great stickler for fresh air. He could not live without it, he said, and it was particularly needful when a man was dying. So he abandoned that project, but the attempt and the fright set him to thinking whether there was not something, a shade less desperate, that might afford him relief from his embarrassments, and the phantom of suicide vanished before the only less horrible phantom of emigration. 
               America, Australia and the moon presented themselves to his imagination as places off refuge about equally desirable, but, for facility of access, the land of liberty was too decidedly foremost to admit of hesitation in choice. America it should be, and Daniel hastened, desperately, to disclose his resolution to Betty and the ten children, who received it with an endless variety of emotions, the lachrymose certainly predominating with all but Dick, who said the game must be glorious about New York, particularly the buffaloes. Belinda and Clara were terrified at the thoughts of Indians and alligators, and Elsie had heard that the musquitoes, which she supposed to be some formidable animal, quite devoured foreigners, and she wondered whether Dick's two terriers and her father's new hounds would be of any service in keeping them at bay. 
               Several successive family councils were held, in which Mr. Dillon having first irrevocably decided the matter on his own mind, magnanimously allowed every one freely to express an opinion on the subject. There was a clear majority of eleven against the measure, and Daniel, like a defeated minister, thought again of resigning his post, but the fumes of the charcoal were fresh in his memory and he declared the matter fully adjudicated and settled. 
               "You have all had a fair hearing," he said, "and now hear me. We shall sail in April for America, and shall bring up probably somewhere in some of the new states, outside of New York city, I dont know exactly where; but in some place where such a colony as mine (nineteen souls, including dogs and horses) can be kept alive on three hundred and seventy-five pounds a year: All our servants, will be discharged excepting,"- 
                
               "The whipper in," suggested Dick. 
               "Excepting one maid," said the father. 
               "Only one for all of us, papa?" said Belinda; "why, what on earth shall we do? She will have to be always in the kitchen, and then how can we all dress ourselves without assistance-in case of a party, for instance?" 
               "The Pottowatimies' party-dress consists of only one feather and a little paint," said Dick. 
               "Oh my!" exclaimed number four of the beef-faced boys; "would'nt it be jolly though, to go to one of their parties? Do you think they will send you an invitation, Dicky?" 
               "They are more apt to call in person," said Dick, "and they are visiters whom it is generally best to be 'not at home' to, if possible." 
               "Why, Dicky?" enquired the wondering boy; "aint they nice?" 
               "Not over nice about some things," said Richard, laughing; "In fact, they are rather apt to cut their acquaintances." 
               "How can you jest on such horrid subjects, Dick?" said Elsie; "I am sure, you terrify me dreadfully. Papa, are there any Indians in the city of New York?" 
               "A few tribes, I believe," replied Daniel, whose ideas of the new world were exceedingly vague; "a few tribes, but not of the most ferocious kind. There are the Hunkers, and the Barnburners, and the-the"- 
               "Bowery Boys!" said Dick; "I think I've read something about such a tribe." 
               "Quite likely," added the father; "but we have nothing to fear from any of them, as they are all nearly half-civilized; besides, we shall stop in the city only long enough to find a carriage to take us to Wisconsin or Iowa, or somewhere back there where land is cheap." 
               "We had better take our family carriage," said Richard, "as we shall have the horses, and then we shall be all equipped for a start, as soon as we reach port." 
               "We shall need some one to show us the way," said Belinda. 
               "There'll be finger-posts," said Clara. 
               "And lots of emigrants all along the road," said Elsie. "Papa, is there more than one road to Wishconsing? And is it very far?" 
               "I really don't know, my dear; only one road, I suppose, as roads are very difficult to make in new countries, and Congress, we know, is very economical. As to the distance, Dick ought to know better about that, being just from college. I should think it might be a considerable way, and yet not so very far either, hey-Dick?" 
               "That's about my opinion, father," said the son. "The truth is, I fear I don't know much about the matter. Wisconsin, I understand to be a new territory which is soon to come into the Union; but where it is to come from, or how it is to get in, I confess I don't exactly understand. There is a mystery about their mode of doing business over there, that I cannot fathom. For instance now, Mr. Senator Somebody says, speech in Congress, that Texas stood knocking at the door for admission, and he seemed to threaten that, unless they let her in, she would turn on her heels and go off somewhere else-to New Zealand, perhaps. I fancied I saw her 'making tracks,' and growling at the gatekeeper for not letting her in." 
               A shout of laughter from the juveniles responded to Dick's odd conceit, but Belinda, who never could comprehend a joke of any dimensions, and was not a little ill-natured withal, said she should be very glad when Dick's nonsense had run dry. 
               "I should be sadly off then, according to your account, 'Linda," replied Richard, good-naturedly, "as my stock of sense has long since experienced a similar exhaustion. My head would be like Paddy's empty hour-glass, full of nothing on both sides." 
               Again Richard had the laugh with him, and Elsie's blue eyes sparkled with the mirth that she dared not display, for fear of giving offence to her staid elder sister. 
               "It will all be very dreadful, I know," said Belinda, "you may laugh now, you little simpletons, but your tune will be changed by and by-that you may depend on." 
               "It will be unpleasant enough, doubtless," said Daniel, dolefully; "but we must make the best of it." 
               "It will do very well, if we can only all preserve our health, and keep together," said Mrs. Dillon. 
               "It will be very comfortable, if we only resolve to make it so," said Elsie, timidly, frightened at having uttered so long a sentence. 
               "It will be jolly," said number four. 
               And so the family council ended. 
             
             
               CHAPTER II. 
               MR. DILLON did not change his mind. He had indeed feared that his old enemies, the blues, might make a winter attack upon him, and drive him back again to the other horn of the bi-cornated dilemma to which he had been reduced; but he was so busy in making arrangements for departure, that the azure imps never could find him sufficiently at leisure to give them an audience, excepting just as he retired to his nightly rest, and then his fatigue was invariably so great as to put him at once into a sound sleep. 
               There are said to be two classes of evils for which mortals ought never to grieve, one being those that can be remedied, and the other those that cannot; and it was doubtless in the spirit of this philosophy that Daniel had set so vigorously to work to repair his fortunes as far as lay in his power. Go into exile he must, and he resolved to go with a will, and make, as far as he could, a pleasure of duty, for he had yet enough of the love of 'adventure in his breast to give a zest to his anticipations of life in the new world. For although wearing so many paternal honors, Mr. Dillon was by no means an old, nor yet an elderly man. He had not even attained by several years to the extremest limit of juvenility, as laid down by some very liberal writer, for the benefit, doubtless, of anxious bachelors, to wit-forty-five; and young as he really was for his patriarchal position, he seemed still half a dozen years further removed from the shades of senility, being fresh and rosy in countenance, unwrinkled, and in no wise dilapidated by the spoiler, Time. 
               Arrangements were made with Mr. Bray, the mortgagee, to take full charge of the estate, and, paying himself first out of the income, which he was sure to do under any circumstances, to remit quarterly, the remainder to the proprietor. 
               "It will be a quarterly remittance in truth," said Dick, when he learned, to his surprise, that three-fourths of the rent went to swell the hoard of the lawyer, but his usually merry laughter failed to follow the joke, for he saw with some disquietude, his prospect of an inheritance growing "small by degrees and beautifully less." 
               Bray, who, although rich, penurious, and a miser, was a trustworthy man, undertook the agency of the property without further consideration than the increased punctuality of his payments which it would insure, and as the house was now to be let, its rental promised to add materially to the income of the emigrant family. The attorney was a bachelor of forty-five, suspected of contemplating matrimony, and of designing personally to occupy the mansion of the Dillons, with his yet unwooed bride, and Belinda, whose repugnance to emigration increased daily, began to compare its horrors with that of remaining at home, as Mrs. Bartholomew Bray. 
               She grew sweet upon the agent, and contrived dexterously to throw herself so often in his way, during his now frequent visits to the mansion, that some degree of familiarity naturally sprang up between them, and as Belinda was one of those fortunate young ladies, who can always discover marked attentions in the most ordinary civilities of gentlemen, she jumped readily to the conclusion that Bartholomew was her most devoted admirer. The only remaining question in her mind was whether or not she should throw herself away upon him, and the nearer the time of departure approached, the more she felt inclined to answer this question in the affirmative. True, he was twenty years her senior, and decidedly ugly both in face and figure, but then he was good-natured, and had twenty thousand pounds, a consideration which finally carried the point with Miss Dillon, against all obstacles. 
               She called a confidential council of her two younger sisters on the subject, who being with difficulty made to comprehend or credit so preposterous a scheme, united in hooting at it with true girlish heartiness. But this did not move Belinda. She pronounced them, for the thousandth time, a pair of simpletons, and set herself to planning the ways and means by which she should give Mr. Bray the encouragement necessary to elicit the now fully expected declaration. 
               During the last month of the family's sojourn in Dillonborough, the lawyer's visits were more frequent than ever, and, although they all seemed to be business calls, yet, Belinda knew very well that Love travels in many disguises, and that his arrows may sometimes be feathered by an attorney's quill. Mr. Bray had himself, in early life, visited Philadelphia on professional business, and being consequently supposed to know all about America, of which he had seen literally nothing, excepting the second metropolis, there was an unfailing topic of conversation for Miss Dillon, when she desired to enlist the attention of the lawyer. 
               But week after week of the last precious month elapsed, without any further approach to an explanation, and Belinda began to fear that, after all, she should be left to the tender mercies of the Pottowattimies, when, one fine morning, Clara came rushing into her sister's presence, breathless with the information that Mr. Bray was in the parlor, and had asked particularly for Miss Dillon, and, moreover, that he was very smartly apparelled. 
               "But pray, don't say 'yes,' 'Linda," she added; "for pa and ma will never consent, and Dick will ridicule you to death; he does nothing now but laugh at poor Bray, whenever he comes to the house." 
               "Let them laugh who win," said Belinda, arranging her hair; "and as to papa's consent, has he ever asked mine to take me out of the kingdom, and among the heathens, and am not I of age; and can't Bartholomew and I do as we please?" 
               "Bartholomew and I!" exclaimed Clara, laughing to hear her sister speak of the attorney by his Christian name, which she had done with some vague idea that it sounded younger. "Well, if it has come to that already, it is probably of no use for me to make objections. Mrs. Bartholomew Pray! Why, what on earth will Dick say?" 
               The sisters all entertained a very lively idea of Richard's powers of satire, and dreaded nothing more than becoming the subject of it, although the collegian was really very good-natured, and never directed his sarcasm where it was undeserved. 
               "Dick is a malicious fellow," replied Miss Dillon, "but he may say what he chooses on the other side of the Atlantic." 
               "Oh, Linda, for shame!" exclaimed Clara; "Richard is not ill-natured, and would really love you if you were not always"- 
               "Always what?" interrupted Belinda, petulantly, as the other hesitated. 
               "I don't know, 'Linda, but you know you never had any patience with him, and-and"- 
               "I am not a Job, I confess, which one would need to be to bear with Dick's stupidity and satire, as you call it; but for my part, I am sure I cannot understand his jokes." 
               "That's what he says-that you take the most obvious jokes in earnest, and when he is most serious, you always think he is jesting." 
               "Oh-so you have been talking about me, have you? Well, much good may it do you!" said Belinda, as she whisked out of the room in a passion, and with a countenance which, had it not been elaborately wreathed into smiles before entering the parlor, would have made no very favorable impression upon her visitor. 
               Mr. Bray's face and deportment certainly betrayed a considerable degree of embarrassment, as he rose to address Miss Dillon, and if she had before entertained any doubt of his matrimonial intentions, she very naturally dismissed them now, and nerved herself for the delicate interview which was so evidently in store for her. 
               It was marvellous indeed, to behold the little attorney, hardened and sharpened by twenty years of legal conflict, the terror of whole troops of dilatory debtors, including the very Squire himself, now sit fidgetting and restless upon his chair, abashed before a young lady of twenty-five, whose christening he well remembered having attended. The weather, the roads, and several minor topics, were briefly discussed without any visible diminution of Bartholomew's restraint, while Belinda, seemingly unobservant, calmly noted and triumphed in every new proof of her power over her parchment lover. 
               "Mr. Dillon is a very cruel man, Miss Belinda," he said at length, evidently beginning to approach the delicate topic from a remote point, and coming toward it reluctantly, like a frightened steed, forced to approach the object of its terror. 
               "Cruel to whom?" said Belinda, smiling slightly, and opening her eyes not a little. 
               "To society-to the society of --shire, Miss Dillon, of which he is about to remove so large a portion, and one so very-so very-valuable," replied the attorney. 
               "It will be a large portion numerically," answered Belinda, with a view to giving Mr. Bray an opportunity of narrowing down his compliment, and becoming more personal in its application; "there will be nineteen in all, including dogs and horses." 
               "Yes, yes; nineteen in all," rejoined Bartholomew; "but do you not feel any reluctance to go, as the time draws nigh? Would not you rather stay, for instance, in this fine house, and remain an inhabitant of merry England, even although you were compelled to separate from your family?" 
               "Why, really, you ask singular questions, Mr. Bray," said Belinda, innocently; "one would not like to live away from all one's friends, you know." 
               "Of course-of course-but, suppose now that you had one or two particular friends to live with, in your own old home, where you have resided from infancy, would not you prefer remaining there, to this strange wild venture in a new country?" 
               Belinda hung her head, and slightly colored. The crisis was clearly at hand. 
                
               "Y-yes"-she said, "I might, certainly; it would depend, of course, upon who they were, you know. It would have to be a very particular friend, Mr. Bray, for whom one would give up so much." 
               'Of course-of course; but suppose it was me, and-and"- 
               Belinda gasped. 
               "The truth is, Belinda," he added, now speaking rapidly, and with earnestness; "the truth is, that I am thinking about changing my condition, and settling down in life, as the saying is, and I have been for some time looking around to find a lady suitable for me in disposition, habit, tastes, and-and-years." 
               "Yes," said Miss Dillon. 
               "And who would really care for a fidgetty, foolish old fellow like me." 
               "Yes," said Miss Dillon. 
               "And I begin to flatter myself I have found one"- 
               "Yes!" 
               "That I have found one in-in y-y-your Aunt Bertha!" exclaimed Belinda, with sudden and undisguised astonishment; "why, Mr. Bray, what on earth do you mean?" 
               "That she is really a most excellent and lovely woman, Belinda, of nearly my age, that she seems to understand and approve my suit, but that I am such an old fool that I dare not approach her directly on the subject, and have come to beg your assistance, and also to offer you a perpetual home with us, if she accepts me, as I am certain she will be delighted to have you an inmate of our family." 
               "Why, really, Mr. Bray, this is so very unexpected," said Belinda, adopting unconsciously the formula which she had mentally prepared for replying to a very different proposal. 
               "Of course-of course," replied Bray, "you could not have anticipated it, but you will assist me?" 
               Overwhelmed as Miss Dillon was with mortification and anger, she had discretion enough left to see the importance of preventing Mr. Bray from perceiving her mistake, yet she had not the self-denial to repress a bitter reply. 
               "Do not depend on me, I beg," she said; "indeed I have always been under the impression that people who remain single until they are old, would do much better to continue so through life. I may be mistaken, of course, but that is my theory. As to the part you propose for me, in this remarkable drama, I fear it would scarcely suit my powers. I should not be up in my part, and besides, I should be rather young to give away the bride." 
               "Give away the bride, Miss Dillon! Why, what do you mean?" asked the now really abashed attorney. 
               "Oh, I mistake; it was for the purpose of making the offer that you required my services. The other request would follow in time, doubtless. But I must really decline; and indeed, I think my aid quite unnecessary, for if you will only give Aunty ft hint, I dare say she will make tile proposal posal herself. As to your other proposition, I am much obliged, and all that, of course; but dear papa could not possibly spare me, nor could I think of leaving him; so, good morning, Mr. Bray;" and Belinda, unceremoniously left the room, crimson with wrath and shame. 
               It was a critical moment for the fate of Aunt Bertha, for Bartholomew, mortified and incensed at the spiteful treatment which he had received from the vixen niece, had well nigh forsworn the sex in general, and the Dillon race in particular; but better thoughts returned, and calling himself a great number of blockheads and donkeys, he went in person and popped the question with perfect success, that very evening. 
               Secrets, like steam, have a wonderfully expansive power, and so, to her measureless chagrin, Belinda found, for despite every effort at suppression, the story of her aspirations and discomfiture got abroad, and being every where talked of, had the effect to work a very decided change in her views of emigration. She resolved to brave the Indian tomahawks, rather than the sarcasms of her village neighbors. 
             
             
               CHAPTER III. 
               "THERE are nineteen of us," said Daniel; in bargaining with Captain Stone, or Stun, as he called himself, of the ship Blazer, for a passage to New York, for he bad resolved to go in a Yankee vessel, hoping to propitiate the American government by so flattering a preference, and having a sort of indistinct idea that he should disembark under the very eyes of the national Congress. "There are nineteen of us," he said, abstractedly, for the number had become in some way firmly fixed in his mind, in connection with his emigrating scheme. 
               Captain Stone looked puzzled, and feared very much that he had not cabin room for so many, but said he would see what could be done. The chance was one not to be lost. 
               "Four of us are dogs and horses," said Dick, in explanation, perceiving his father's mistake; "three are servants, and two more are babies. Perhaps this will make some difference." 
               "Oh, yes, surely; I've abundance of room for twelve," said the Captain, "besides two berths already partly engaged, and one other taken by a great man from Oo-is-consin." 
               "A great man from Wisconsin, Dick, do you hear that?" said Mr. Dillon. "In what does his greatness consist, Captain Stone?" 
               "Wal, probably he knows that best himself," replied the Captain, not meaning to be at all uncivil in his reply; "I can't exactly make him out, but he talks mighty large, and seems to be a sort of fynancycal agent of something or other, and has been out here selling bond to the John Bulls, and has made a good round commission, I guess." 
                
               "Then he is going home with you, I suppose? Shall you go round that way, or-or stop there?" asked Mr. Dillon, hesitatingly. 
               "What way?" said the Captain. 
               "Why, to Wisconsin, where this man lives." 
               "Not this time," replied the Captain, grinning, "the Blazer goes to New York with a cargo neow, but arter that, if you see fit to charter her, I reckon she could as well go to Milwaakie as any where else." 
               "Milwayky!" said Dick, now laughing in his turn; "I hope that's a different place from the Milky Way, for if it ain't, it's more than I bargained for, you know, father. I agreed to go a long way, but I have a partiality for the solar system." 
               "Tut, tut, boy; listen to Captain Stone." 
               "Milwaakie is the capital of Ooisconsin," said the Captain, "and I ken go there with my Blazer, if needful." 
               "There are few things that a Yankee can't do, if needful, I believe," replied Mr. Dillon; "but is it our best mode of going? Would it be much out of your way?" 
               "Con-siderable." 
               "More than a hundred miles?" 
               "Wal, let's see," said the Captain, reckoning with all his fingers; "from New York to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, say eight hundred miles; across the Gulf, say three hundred miles; from there tew Lake Ontario, say six hundred; then up the Ontario two hundred-then up the Falls of Niagara"- 
               "Up what, Captain Stone?" 
               "Areound 'em, I mean-don't put me out-areound 'em by the Ship Canal-up Lake Erie three hundred-up the Detroit river, Lake St. Clair and Lake Huron, three hundred more-up Lake Michigan two"- 
               "Stop there-that will do," exclaimed Mr. Dillon, aghast at the mention of these interminable distances in the interior of a country. "I think we won't go that way; why, it's further than the route across the Atlantic." 
               "Yes, a little further," said Captain Stone, coolly; "but then that's a rather round abeout way. By the usually travelled routes, it's only about twelve to fifteen hundred miles from New York." 
               "Fifteen hundred miles by the short way! Do you hear that, Dick?" said his father, lugubriously. 
               "I expected to canter out there in an afternoon from New York, and then come back the next morning, and tell you what kind of a place it was," said Dick; "I did, 'pon honor; however"- 
               Dick was never daunted, and usually wound up his narrations of all misfortunes and disappointments by the expressive adverb with which his reply to his father terminated, using the word with a peculiar intonation which rang rather merrily; and implied a great deal of consolation of a very vague character. Dick's "however" was, in short, a very remarkable word. It was the beginning of a sentence that was never finished, and at the end of a sad story, it stood alone, like a finger-post, pointing off towards indefinite fields of hope and expectation. 
               "Never mind," said Captain Stone, using with much emphasis, that first half of what a recent French writer styles the watchword of modern America; "never mind! the distance is nothing-nothing at all; but you will find your live-stock troublesome, and I reckon you had better sell your horses and knock your dogs on the head before starting." 
               "My hounds, if you mean them, are much obliged to you for the suggestion," said Richard, coldly, "and as they are not yet booked for the Blazer, perhaps they will find safer berths, in another ship. 
               "Oh, by no manner of means, young gentleman," replied the Captain, hurriedly; "I meant no offence to the dogs, and will neither harm them nor see them harmed on board my vessel. Let them once touch her planks, and they will be under the protection of the American flag." 
               "Good!" said Dick, "that's something they'll appreciate. Mind, you show it to 'em, Captain Stun." 
               The Captain laughed, Mr. Dillon pshawed, and Dick, leaving his father to complete the arrangements, put his thumbs in the arm-holes of his waistcoat, and walked homeward, whistling-" Britannia rules the waves." 
               The bargain was struck, and a week later the Blazer was under sail, bearing from the shores of Albion, a full dozen of Dillons with all their "belongings," not excepting Flash and Dash, the slighted hounds, whose unmusical yelp in their strange quarters, Dick said, was only their render-ng of the popular song, 
                     "My bark is on the sea."
                  
                
             
             
               CHAPTER IV. 
               THE Blazer was not a regular packet, but a transient merchant vessel, which having proved a very fast sailor, and acquired a reputation as such, had been fitted up with cabin accommodations unusual for vessels of that class, and now made for transportation of passengers quite a prominent item in her earnings, competing with the regular lines by outdoing some of them in speed, and all, in the cleanness of her fare. Her commander and part owner, was not backward in making her merits known in every port where he dropped anchor, and thus it was that he seldom sailed without a considerable number of passengers; yet the Dillons had proved quite a windfall to him on the present occasion, for, in consequence of some necessity for a speedy return to New York, he had not had the usual time to blow his trumpet. He was richly freighted, and had his full allowance of steerage emigrants, but as he could not have waited for other passengers, he would probably, but for the English family, have had his "elegant saloon," as he termed his cabin, tenanted only by the three individuals of whom he had spoken. 
               The good fortune of the Captain, however, was at first little relished by the honorable Adonijah Popham, the great man from Wisconsin, who found himself restricted to comparatively narrow quarters, after the unexpected irruption of the Dillons into the saloon, but inasmuch as a theatre for the display of his personal importance was by the same means opened to him, he became quickly reconciled to the change. Variety is essentially social, and Mr. Popham was not slow in breaking the ice of Daniel's reserve, ard obtaining some clue to his history and his aims, an inquisition to which the Englishman the more readily submitted, because he thought it might prove to his interest to do so. 
               The Wiscon-sinner, (as Dick called him,) was a stoutish, red-faced, middle-aged man, somewhat of the puff-ball order, with scant hair and straggling black whiskers, which seemed to run wild over his cheeks, with no particular boundary line in any direction; and possessing a nose of very insignificant proportions, compared to the extent of surface in the midst of which it was planted. 
               But if Mr. Popham was sociable in the first instance, his affability knew no bounds when he learned that Mr. Dillon proposed colonizing some indefinite portion of the Far West with his pilgrim band, for he was a proprietor of many square miles of wild land in Wisconsin, one-half of which was under mortgage, and the other half under water. 
               "If any man knows the West, Mr. Dillon-the Great West," said Adonijah, bringing his hand down with a jarring emphasis upon the dinner-table, which made the glasses ring as if shook by a "ninth wave" in a storm; that man is before you. I seldom speak of myself, sir; and never boast-but the West, sir, is my hobby. When that subject is mentioned, I can't be silent." 
               "Pray, don't think of such a thing," said Dillon, pushing a bottle of his own wine towards the speaker. "I should be most happy to have your views of it." 
               "My views, sir," replied Popham, filling and emptying his glass; "my views are necessarily large and extensive, like the subject of them; vast, like its territory; wide, like its lakes, and-and-undulating, if I may say so. like its prairies." 
               "Here an oratorial flourish of the speaker's arm upset a castor-stand, and sent the cruets rolling about the table. 
               "Undulating, like the prairies," repeated Mr. Popham, collecting at the same time, his ideas and the cruets, and replacing each, "if-if I may say so." 
               You may say so, certainly, if you choose," whispered Dick to Clara, "but it's arrant nonsense, notwithstanding." 
               "The West, sir, he continued, "is an immense country, abounding in-in fresh air, and very far removed from the corruption, and the-the-smoke of the great Atlantic cities; yes, sir, and wanting nothing, sir, for a full development of all its vast resources, excepting plenty of people, sir, and lots of tin." 
               "Otherwise, called money, I suppose," said Mr. Dillon. 
               "Otherwise, called money," replied Adonijah, bowing, and helping himself again to wine. "These are exceedingly small glasses. I seldom drink myself, but when I do, I like several swallows. The West, sir, is a field for genius to expand in-for art, science, religion and commerce to flourish in; for freedom to take root and grow in-for-for-" 
               "Foxes to run in, I hope, sir," said Dick, with a tone and air of the utmost politeness, as the other paused for an idea. 
               "Why, yes, young gentleman," replied Adonijah, quite knocked off his stilts by so common-place a question; "there are plenty of foxes there, I believe, and of the best quality; not that I remember ever to have seen one personally, but I will venture to say that, if foxes exist any where, they may be found in the great West." 
               "The animal is by no means a fabulous one, I assure you," returned Dick, "as Flash and Dash can testify; but I presume you do not mean to say that you have never seen a fox any where?" 
               "Not to my knowledge," replied Mr. Popham, bowing. 
               "Why, what a sappy!" whispered number four to Elsie, while Mr. Dillon and Dick felt conscious of a feeling much akin to contempt towards their new acquaintance. 
               "But," continued Mr. Popham, looking very wise and oracular, as he filled a fourth glass; "although there may be, and undoubtedly are, plenty of foxes in the great West, yet I must warn you not to expect the pleasure of chasing them in that region." 
               "Why not, sir?" asked Richard quickly, and with evident alarm. 
               "Because, sir-because our foxes are not used to it. They don't understand that sort of thing at all, sir. How should they, sir? Fox-hunting is not at all practised there-not at all." 
               "Oh, ho!-that's it, that's it?" said Richard, laughing heartily. "Well, never fear, I think my hounds will be able to teach them the game." 
               "Your hounds, Mr. Dillon! Excuse me, sir," replied Popham, with a slight hiccough; "do not think, sir, that American foxes will run before English hounds." 
               A hearty laugh all round the table responded to this remark, which Adonijah took as a compliment, and smiled complacently. 
               "Very well, then," said Dick, "but suppose I should procure some American hounds, would they not run then?" 
               "Possibly they might run a little," replied Popham, unwilling to concede the whole ground, "but as I said before, they are quite unused to that sort of thing. But, sir, this is all an episode; I was speaking, I believe, of the great West. I wish to speak of the West. I-I-" 
               "Try this sherry," said Dick, anxious to stop the threatened effusion, and the Wisconsinner tried the sherry, and pronounced it, "splendid." He tried it a second time, and called it "magnificent." It did not stop his remarks, however, for no sooner was the empty glass set down than the interruped eulogium was resumed with increased animation and force, but with a slight occasional incoherence that was far from being suspected by the speaker, who was fast getting into a maudlin state. Richard slyly refilled his glass several times, and Adonijah as regularly emptied it at the close of some unusually long and lofty sentence, seeming to be under the impression that he had forgotten to do so before. Mr. Dillon did not perceive this game, or he would have prohibited it, for soon the speaker's blunders became numerous and ridiculous, and although there was a dead calm, he stopped frequently to complain of the rolling of the ship. From the West in general, the orator descended to Wisconsin in particular, and thence, finally, to his own domain, which resulted in a second time capsizing the perseculted casters. 
               "Ex-excuse me," said Adonijah, addressing the vanquished stand, and nodding apologetically to it, as he replaced it upon its feet; but the general explosion of laughter which followed, failed to awaken him to a suspicion that the merriment was at his expense. 
               "But I will not en-enlarge on this subject, Mr. Dillon," said he; "you shall see it sir, and judge for yourself-and for-for your children-hem! This ship certainly pitches badly. Captain Stone, the Blazer don't behave well, sir-she rolls too much for a good vessel-I hope she has sufficient ballast, sir." 
               "Oh, yes, she has ballast enough," replied the Captain, emphasizing the pronoun, and smiling broadly. 
               "I hope you don't consider the storm dangerous, Captain Stone?" said Adonijah. 
               "Not particular, sir. I think we shall weather it." 
               "Got every thing snug, I suppose, Captain Stone, that's the way in a gale. You perceive I know something about these matters. Where is the wind, Captain Stone?" 
               "I'll be hanged if I know where it is," replied the Captain sotto voce; "nowhere in these parts, that's sartain! The sea is as smooth as glass." 
               "No, I thank you, not another glass," said Popham; "indeed this motion inclines me to be a little sea-sick-and I think-I will-lie down," and so, shaking hands cordially with all the company, and wishing them severally a happy voyage to New York, as if he were about to return to England himself, he reeled to his state room, and spent the remainder of the evening in close confinement. 
               The calm continued on the sea until the next morning, but there were violent indications of a storm throughout the night in Mr. Popham's room, and his own idea the peril became so fixed, that he frequently spoke of it during the subsequent part of the voyage, as something very imminent, and from which they had very narrowly escaped. 
               The impression made by Adonijah upon his English acquaintances was far from being altogether unfavorable, Mr. Dillon having a decided respect for him as a large landed proprietor, given, indeed, to free living, and a little apt to be silly in his cups, but then, thought Daniel, if a rich man has not a right to be silly now and then, what is the use of being rich? 
               "Your can see that that man has a stake in society," he said, after the American had withdrawn from the table. 
               "Yes," said Dick, "I saw that he had a very large steak, this morning, and lots of potatoes." 
               "He may be of the greatest assistance to us." 
               "He seems to me very much like one of the help-himself-first-kind of people," said Dick. 
               "He owns several towns, I believe-so atleast the Captain says, and he may give you a borough-membership one of these days." 
               "Yes, or a right to shoot over his preserves," said Clara. 
               "Shoot over his fiddlesticks!" replied Dick; "a man who don't quite know whether he has ever seen a fox or not, and who does not know a hare from a hedgehog." 
               "Never mind; he knows enough to get ahead; or as the Yankees say, he knows where he sleeps." 
               "Not to-night, I guess," said number four. 
               "Good for you, Neddy! Here's some filberts," said Richard; "now go and see to the dogs, while I look after the horses, for if Brutus and Cassius are left long without their oats, they will stamp a hole through their stable flooring, and let us all down into old Neptune's pastures. I think I hear them whinnying now." 
               So saying, Richard went on deck, followed by the lad whom he had addressed, and by several of the other children, all anxious to see where the animals were quartered, and to extend to their several favorites their childish greeting and caresses. 
             
             
               CHAPTER V. 
               TWO cabin passengers in the Blazer have been spoken of, who have not been described. One of these was a stately young English gentleman, whose name was on the ship's books as Melancthon Niles, and who, not having been seen to speak or listen to any one down to the third day of the passage out, (the epoch to which our history has arrived,) was fully believed by the Dillon children, to be deaf and dumb, and with whom Master Neddy accordingly undertook to open a communication by means of a manual alphabet. This laudable enterprise was unfortunately interrupted, almost in its inception, by a box on the ears from Belinda, which, with the aid of a slight lurch of the ship, sent the astonished lad quite into a large Yankee spittoon in the corner of the cabin. 
               Mr. Niles was twenty-seven years of age, with a fair handsome face and good figure, having a great deal of baggage and a servant, but the only signs of life which he gave besides locomotion and eating and drinking, was an occasional glance at the glossy brown curls of little Elsie, and at the large blue eyes that peeped out from among them. On the fifth day out, however, according to Richard's log, he was observed to exhibit symptoms of an attempt at articulation; on the sixth, he actually spoke, and told the shivering Mr. Dillon that it was cold; and on the seventh, when Dick came in from the deck, reeking with rain, he informed him that he was wet. After this, he occasionally sidled toward Richard when Elsie was on his arm, and ventured into short sentences of easy words, not with the least degree of embarrassment, but with a very difficult unbending of a very stately dignity, which hampered him like a coat of mail. 
               Elsie did nothing but laugh at him, which seemed to please him very much, and Belinda, who saw clearly in his advances to her younger sister, the incipient steps of his intended addresses to herself, encouraged Elsie to be as sociable as possible with the monster, and assured her that she should not be harmed. 
               The remaining passenger, the servant who has been alluded to, was a young man not unlike his master in size and figure, and increasing the resemblance by wearing the discarded garments of the other, which usually came to him but little worn, and consequently gave him quite a stylish air. Fellows, however, (for such was his name,) seemed to know his place very well, and to be quite satisfied with it, notwithstanding his apparent ability to occupy a much higher position in the social scale. He evidently had the full confidence of his employer. 
               Mr. Niles grew daily more social; he sat later and later every succeeding day at dinner, listened to the elder Dillon's longest stories of the chase with interest, and sometimes related similar tales in return. Although habitually an abstemious man, he drank multitudes of the Squire's toasts, including some to the memory of deceased hounds and hunters, and once, suddenly remembered that he had a dozen dozens of the choicest wines stowed away some where among his baggage, which Fellows was required speedily to unearth. He was too well bred to talk of himself, but he spoke so frequently of Devonshire as to induce a belief that he had been a resident of that part of England. 
               "You seem to be so well acquainted in the South," said Mr. Dillon, "that I hope you will allow me to inquire whether you know any thing of a Mr. Charles Henry Upton, a young gentleman of large landed estates in that part of the country?" 
               "Upton? Oh, yes," replied Niles, "I know him very well-a hypochondriacal young man, said to be so immensely rich that he does not know what to do with his money." 
               "If I might venture to interrupted Adonijah hurriedly, "Pophamville, though I say it, presents advantages for investment that are well worthy of his attention. Will you have the kindness to mention this fact to your friend in your next letter?" 
               "Most certainly," replied Niles, bowing politely to the founder of a city, and then addressing Mr. Dillon. "Mr. Upton is then an acquaintance of yours, I presume?" 
               "No, scarcely so," said Dillon; "I knew him as a boy, many years ago; he is, in fact, a third or fourth cousin of Mrs. Dillon. We often hear of his great wealth, and his singular melancholy; but how a rich man, without wife or child, can contrive to be miserable, is more than I can understand. Only think of a man with twelve thousand a year being subject to the blues; ho! ho! ho!" and the speaker laughed till his face grew purple. 
               "Gosh!" exclaimed the captain, "you don't mean to say neow that your cousin there really has sixty thousand dollars a year for his hull life?" 
               "All of that, I am told," replied Dillon. 
               "Considerably more, to my knowledge," said Niles. 
               "I swow! that's more'n twice as much as the President of the 'Nited States gits," said Stone; "and then to think of his being down in the mouth about it, arter all-it's tew bad." 
               "He should try fox hunting," said Dick; "ah! I wish I could have my nice cousin mounted on Brutus, with Cassius and I to give him the lead, some fine frosty morning, when the scent lies well, with Puss lively, and the dogs wide awake-if we did not distance the blues so far that they could not overtake him for a week, I'd forfeit the best hound in the pack. Even one of those buffalo hunts that we are going to have on the prairies would doubtless do the poor fellow good, though I fear buffalo-catching will prove rather tame business." 
               "He must be a dull man, indeed, if he could not find much to interest him in the society of his relations," said Niles, glancing momentarily at the young ladies, and calling up a bona fide blush on the face of Miss Belinda, who only of the sisters dreamed of appropriating the compliment. "I am surprised that he should have remained so long a stranger to them." 
               "The children have never even seen him," said Daniel, glancing at Dick and the girls, "excepting little Elsie there, who spent a fortnight with an aunt in that part of the country last year." 
               "And did they meet?" asked Niles, with interest. 
               "Once at a party, where Upton was exceedingly polite to his cousin and invited both her and Aunt Esther to his house on an ad libitum visit, but the old lady, whom he had long neglected, took his conduct in high dudgeon, and bridling up, told him that when she or Elsie were in want of shelter, they would be certain to let him know it." 
               "And what said Charles to that?" 
               "He stared a moment at her-glanced curiously at Elsie, and then, entirely unmoved, commenced menced a conversation with some one near him about the approaching races, and in five minutes he seemed to have forgotten both aunt and niece, and probably he has never thought of them since." 
               "It was unfortunate," said Niles; "Upton, doubtless, meant kindly, but he does not pay much regard to etiquette, and doubtless forgot that he ought, with his sister, who lives with him, to have called upon the ladies before extending to them such an invitation. Besides, I remember that he had some cause of dislike to the old lady, Mrs. Stanton I think her name was." 
               "Rather, yes; I was often in his house, and he quite as often at mine." 
               "Yes, that was the name; you must have been very intimately acquainted with Cousin Upton." 
               More than one of the Dillons, not excepting the Squire, burned with curiosity to learn more, not only about their rich relation, but about their travelling companion, the object of his voyage, the time of his intended return to England, and, above all, the nature of his connection with their relative; but they were too well bred to indulge in any impertinent inquisitiveness. The conversation, which had become animated, was interrupted by the hurried entrance into the cabin of the second mate, a green-looking young man, whose long, straight hair protruded from beneath his unremoved cap, and half-covered his pale, lank cheeks. 
               "What do you want, Jotham?" asked the captain. 
               "If you please, sir, Mr. Ball wants you to come up and see about the ice; he don't know whether to go through it or around it." 
               "Ice!" exclaimed Captain Stone rising' with alarm, "and night coming on too, why tell him to give it the widest possible berth, of course, even if we lose twenty four hours by it." 
               "He says it isn't very thick, sir," replied Jotham. 
               "Not very thick!" muttered the Captain, following the young man up the gangway," mebbe not, but his skull is consarnedly thick, if he don't know enough to keep out of the way of an ice-field." 
               It was not yet dark, and curiosity and alarm at once drew all the passengers upon deck, where a beautiful sight met their view, and one which, at first glance, seemed to give no cause for uneasiness. A large island of ice, divided by rents and fissures into millions of brilliant sections, lay between them and the setting sun, whose horizontal beams, as it lingered on the horizon's edge, illumined the glass-like surfaces of the mass, and lit up with peculiar radiance its more prominent parts. These eminences, which, falling short of the dignity of bergs, are called by the sailors hummocks, are formed by the crowding up of some portions of the field between others, and sometimes rise to the height of thirty feet, assuming strange and fantastical forms. They seemed like watch-towers upon the elfin land which they adorned, but their number and size were such as to render their close companionship by no means desirable to the voyagers, and Captain Stone was the last man to look upon them with a poetical eye. The field lay directly in their path, and was of immense size, stretching many miles to the north and south, and, although a considerable portion of it was loose, drift ice, through which the vessel could have safely passed, the greater part of the floe was by no means of so harmless a character. Its direction was southeasterly, and the ship, by the imprudence of the officer in command, had been allowed to attain a very dangerous proximity to that floating mass, before the alarm was given, and even that brief space, was being rapidly diminished by the combined movements of the vessel and the ice. Captain Stone at once changed the course of the Blazer, diverging as widely from the object of alarm as the direction of the wind would permit; but the breeze was fast sub-siding, and before midnight entirely died away, leaving the fugitive vessel still in the dangerous vicinity, and liable, through various contingencies, to be imbedded in the pursuing floe. 
               Sleep visited but few eyes on board the Blazer during that night, the Captain and his mates all remaining on duty, while most of the cabin passengers also continued late on deck. 
               "It seems all very quiet," said Adonijah, addressing the captain. "I really don't think there's much to fear, even if we should get amongst it." 
               "Mebbe not," was the reply, in a significant tone. 
               "Allow me to ask in what particular form do you most apprehend danger?" inquired Mr. Dillon, politely. 
               "Being squashed, to begin with," said Nathan, "or being starved, which aint much better. I aint provisioned for two months, am I? And don't you see, that if we get locked up in that 'ere ice there, which is spreading out its arms so lovingly to catch us, don't you see that we may be toting round here till the fourth of Jewly? like Captain 'Lezer Jones' schooner, which was thirteen weeks fast, somewhere in these parts, and the men would ha' been all starved, if it had not been for a lot of inger-rubber shoes they had on board." 
               "India-rubber shoes, Captain Stone!" exclaimed Mr. Popham. 
               "Yes, sir; they had sucked the vartue out of fifteen boxes of them, and were on an allowance of one pair a day per man, with three ounces of bran, when they were rescued." 
               "But you spoke of another peril?" 
               "Yes, being squashed-that's the greatest danger, after all. Many's the ship, particularly the whalers, further north, that has been lost by being dashed against the ice in a gale, till they sprung a dozen leaks and went down. Sometimes it's done by the ice dashing against them, which amounts to about the same thing; there aint much choice, I'm told, for either way it will wear a hole through a ship about as soon as so much rock. The old sea-captains tell about a fleet of twenty-seven whale-ships being beset by ice on on one of the northern fishing-grounds many years ago, and a storm coming on, and breaking up ten on 'em into mere drift-wood, all in a few hours-" 
               "And the men?" 
               "Most on 'em went down, in course, but a great many escaped by skipping, like seals, from one piece of ice to another, until they reached the firm ice, where they were taken off, after the gale was over, by boats from other ships." 
               "But have any such accidents ever happened in these latitudes?" 
               "Why, there was Captain 'Lezer Jones' schooner-" 
               "Yes-you told us of that; but these shipwrecks amongst the ice that you mention?" 
               "P'raps not-can't say-but what becomes of all the ships that go out of port and are never heard of more? Suppose a vessel going ten knots an hour should run agin one of them 'ere hummocks in the night-why it might as well be the rock of Gibraltar, and most on 'em on board would never know but what it was, 'cause the first thing they did know, they'd be at the bottom of the sea." 
               Captain Stone's audience began to manifest no little anxiety as these doleful pictures were drawn, and to cast frequent glances in the direction of the ice, which seemed, as by some strange attraction, to be drawn continually towards them. 
               "I don't wish to frighten nobody," he continued, "but it is best to be on our guard. Howsoever, you had better all go to your berths, and, if any thing looks very dangerous, I'll see that you are called time enough to get out on the ice." 
               This encouragement did not have a tendency to make any one very sleepy, but, on the contrary, it partly awoke Adonijah, who had now been some minutes nodding, but who, after staring stupidly at the speaker a few seconds, and muttering something about getting some provisions ready, went off again into a series of short naps. 
               Most of the passengers, however, soon retired to the cabin, whence they sent up frequent delegations to the quarter-deck for intelligence, which became hourly more serious, until about the dawn of day, when they heard the dreaded ice crackling around the vessel. By noon of the same day, the spreading floe, which seemed to expand in obedience to some law of its own, independent of tides or winds, encircled them to the extent of half a mile on the outer side, a breadth of barrier which every hour increased, without seeming to diminish the immensely wider margin which extended in the opposite direction. 
             
             
               CHAPTER VI. 
               WHILE the calm continued, no immediate danger was to be apprehended, and even a considerable breeze might be compatible with safety, as long as the water was not enough agitated to give any violent motion to either the vessel or the ice. Sailing being out of the question, the ship was kept under bare poles, but Captain Stone indulged a strong hope, from the seeming diffusion of the floe, that it would soon take the character of drift-ice, through which the vessel might be navigated. Some parts of the field were already of this description, but the portion in which the voyagers were imbedded was sufficiently compact to defy all attempts at progress, other than what was communicated to them by the general movement of the mass. 
               The alarm which had at first prevailed gradually subsided, as the voyagers found themselves resting quietly hour after hour without any new indication of danger, and notwithstanding the frequent apparition of "Captain 'Lezer Jones' schooner," which seemed ever before the excited imagination of Captain Stone, and was by him perpetually lugged into conversation, a general reaction of feeling soon took place, and mirth and hilarity was the order of the day. 
               A second and a third day passed without change, and the weather continuing very fine, and admitting of abundance of deck exercise, but little complaint was heard. Adonijah, indeed, grew more uneasy, and spent much of the time we lay searching over the vast waste of waters, with the aid of a small pocket-glass, for other vessels, which he thought might in some way render them assistance. 
               "What good would it do you," asked Captain Stone, "if a ship should come along here, cluss to the edge of the ice, which they'd be darned clear of doing, and if they did, they'd be hard on to tew miles off then. Why, when Captain 'Lezer Jones' schooner-" 
               "The devil take Capt. 'Lezer Jones' schooner," replied Mr. Popham, angrily; "one would think that, after getting us all into such a scrape as this, you might do something besides croaking." 
               "No offence," said Nathan, who held his portly passenger in no little awe, "but what can I dew? I don't mean to croak, as you call it, nor discourage any body by no means. I dare say we shall do well enough, if we ever get out. But how on airth we're going to get out, or when, is more'n I can tell." 
               "How did-the gentleman that you spoke of get out?" asked Pop ham, somewhat hesitatingly. 
               "What! Cap'n 'Lezer Jones? Why that was just what I was going to tell you about, when you riled up so. He thawed out, he did-in the summer-with hardly strength enough left in all hands to set a sail, or turn the wheel; but fort'nately he spoke a liner next day, and obtained a supply of provisions, and reached home safely the day after his funeral sermon was preached." 
               "He was supposed to be lost, then?" 
               "Yes, for he was more'n three months behind time, and one of his boats had somehow got astray, and had been picked up, with the vessel's name on her, and that was taken as proof positive of the loss, so that the Insurance Office had forked over, and mighty glad they was to get the money back, I tell you." 
               "I hope they will not have to pay yours," said Adonijah, gloomily. 
               "I hope not," responded Nathan; "but if they do, three-eighths of it will go to the captain's wife, although you mightn't think, p'raps, to look at me, that I owned as much as that of the Blazer." 
               Mr. Popham gazed abstractedly at the speaker for a moment, as if he expected to discover in his countenance some proofs of his proprietorship of the ship, and then shaking his head, probably unconsciously, he turned away, and resumed his explorations with his pocket-telescope. 
               The next day was unusually bright; there was a mild, May-like atmosphere, and only the lightest breezes disturbed the repose of old Ocean, who seemed, by gentleness of demeanor, to be living down the slanderous charges so often preferred against him, of fierce and fickle conduct. 
               Weary of the monotony, the travellers were seeking various amusements on the quarter-deck, and were trying very hard not to exhibit any portion of the anxiety which all really entertained. In one corner Elsie was sketching the ship, with the field of ice by which it was surrounded, while Dick, at her side, desisted at times from the arrangement of some very complicated fishing-tackle, to criticise her work, and to heap pretended ridicule upon it. Near to them sat Clara, netting, while a little further off Belinda divided her attention between the "Loves of the Angels" and the graceful figure of Mr. Niles, who was promenading at the opposite end of the deck. Mr. Dillon, senior, sat smoking a cigar, and chatting to his wife, and Adonijah knelt over a gaudy map of upper Wisconsin, which he had spread upon the deck, and was studying with great assiduity. 
               "There, Dick, it's completed now," said Elsie, shaking her curls from her eyes, and holding up a really beautiful and correct picture before her brother's face. "How does it appear?" 
               "Humph! so, so!" said Dick, showing his delight in his sparkling eyes, but still bent on badinage; "but what are all these watch-houses out here on the ice for, and that long corn-crib there, and this dog-kennel off here,-eh?" 
               "Oh! those are the hummocks, Dick; look, there they are," exclaimed Elsie, earnestly; "don't you think they are like?" 
               "Oh! ah! yes; but have not you the perspective a little wrong here?" continued her tormentor; "this young: hummock here looks as though it were on the ship; see!" 
               "That? Why, Richard! That's the wheel-house: of course it's on the ship," replied Elsie, much annoyed, and uncertain whether her brother was in earnest or not. "Is it bad, though, Dick, really?" 
               "Hum! not altogether," was the grave reply; "I think your horizon is rather heavy, and these clouds a trifle too much like cotton ton bales; so that one might mistake the design, you know, and think the ship was discharging cargo in order to get off; but on the whole I think it is really quite so-soish." 
               "Oh! Richard! don't you really like it?" said the disappointed girl, now almost in a tone of anguish. 
               "Why, yes, Elsie, the design is certainly good, and the execution admirable, but the piece seems to me to lack warmth," replied the wag, placing his finger upon the icy portions of the view, and no longer repressing a smile. 
               A merry, ringing laugh burst from the fair girl's lips, as she now discovered that her brother had been only in jest, and that he really approved of her work. 
               "Admirable! admirable! I declare it is quite perfect," exclaimed a third voice, startling both the colloquists, who had been too deeply engaged to observe that Mr. Niles had stood for some seconds at their side, intent upon the drawing and the artist. 
               "Oh, Mr. Niles, how you frightened me!" said Elsie, quickly, with entire simplicity, proving he surprise at the same time by coloring to the temples. 
               "I am extremely sorry," replied Niles, smiling, and seeming to enjoy her embarrassment; "I fear that Fellows must have made me more hideous than usual this morning-has he not, Miss Dillon?" 
               "Oh, no, sir;!" replied Elsie, blundering again, and eliciting a loud laugh from both the gentlemen. 
               "That will do, sister of mine!" said Dick, holding his sides; "you can't mend that, possibly, so please lot to try." 
               Niles, in the mean time, had taken the sketch from Miss Dillon's hand, and now proceeded to bestow upon it much judicious praise, pointing out the best parts with critical taste, for, slight as was the piece, it bore unmistakable evidence of genius. Much of "its beauty consisted in the faithful outline of the various figures upon the quarter-deck, each occupied as has been before described, and not one of whom had been omitted, excepting the fair artist herself. He then took the pencil, and, with a few bold and graceful touches, quickly supplied the deficiency, making Elsie's sylph-like figure, and even the contour of her face, quite recognizable, and eliciting general admiration, for by this time most of the company had gathered around the picture. 
               "Capital!" cried Dick; "why this is the very Appellean touch." 
               "It was the subject that inspired me, then," replied the critic, "for I have not touched a pencil in two years, although my drawing-master used to say that I had genius. But my forte is in figures; I could do nothing equal to this beautiful sketch which shall certainly be engraved when we get to New York, that is to say, with Miss Dillon's kind permission." 
               "Oh! I should be delighted!" exclaimed Elsie; "but it really is not worthy of it, I know." 
               "I wish you had waited a little, and made me fishing through a hole in the ice, and drawing up that great sea-bass that I am going to catch presently," said Dick giving the last turn to a noosed cord around a large hook. 
               "Engraved!" said Adonijah, catching for the first time a good view of the drawing, and recognizing his own figure; "I hope you aint a going to engrave me down on all-fours there, like that I can't stand that, you know." 
               "Oh, never mind that, Mr. Popham, nobody will know you," said Richard. 
               "Yes-yes-but don't you see that when I go home, I shall want to take some of these fine engravings along with me, to show my friends how we looked shut up here in the ice; and I shall want one handsomely framed, to hang up in the Pophamville hotel, and another, perhaps, in the Pophamville town hall, and then when people ask me, 'Which of these here figures is you, Mr. Popham?' I don't want to point out this great dog-looking thing for me, do I? You see it isn't a natural position." 
               "It is not exactly the position one would be apt to take when attitudinizing for effect, I confess," answered Dick, laughing, and holding the picture up before him-"yet it must be allowed that it is the exact one which you were in when the drawing was made. However-" 
               "Can't it be altered?" inquired Adonijah, quite gravely. 
               "Oh, yes," answered Richard, "Elsie will straighten you up in a twinkling, if you don't like it; or here! perhaps Mr. Niles will do you." 
               Niles consented, and the Wiscon-sinner was done, entirely to his satisfaction, quite erect, and with his unfailing telescope to his eye. 
               "Your forty is figgers, that's a fact!" he said to Niles, clapping him on the shoulder with great exultation. "You ought to be an artist, sir, and if you'll come to Wisconsin, I'll promise you a sitooation under government, sir. We patronize genus there, we do." 
               Mr. Niles bowed his acknowledgments, but with a smile rather broader than politeness required. 
             
             
               CHAPTER 
                     VI.
                     VII.
                  
                
               RICHARD'S project for fishing in the deep sea was considered rather chimerical by his companions, but in the great dearth of amusements on board the ice-bound vessel, any thing was acceptable that gave even a faint promise of pastime. By their latest observations, the voyagers were not very remote from the grand bank of Newfoundland, and as the old salts had a belief that an ice-roof attracted the "long-shore fish" a considerable distance to sea, where they could even be seen at times bumping their noses against the icy covering of their dwelling, Dick was quite sanguine of success. 
               Several of the sailors, in their weariness of being idle, had already sought and obtained permission to leave the ship, and take short excursions upon the ice, which in one direction was solid and unbroken over a space of several square miles, the vessel lying snugly against it, as if beside a wharf, while on the other side it was blocked by the fragments of the main body through which it had penetrated to its present fixed position. 
               An old tar, with whom Richard had cultivated friendly relations, brought him information of a favorable spot for making his experiment. It was about a third of a mile from the vessel, of course on the solid side, where two large masses of the floe had been joined, and adhering, in the main, closely together, diverged, by reason of an inequality of their edges, around a sort of well-hole, as exactly suited to the purposes of the sportsman, as if it had been excavated for him. This interval was of course not entirely open, but the new ice within it was of slight depth, and could be easily perforated. It was about three o'clock in the afternoon, that Richard set out on his expedition, accompanied by several of the sailors, including his veteran friend, a man of great muscular strength, who was known among his companions as Granite Joe. The hound Dash was also allowed to accompany the party, a piece of favoritism which Flash, his fellow, who was chained on deck, witnessed with the greatest apparent chagrin, and not without making the air ring with his protests. 
               Richard gained his novel fishing-ground without difficulty, and was soon in ecstasies over a success far beyond any that he had anticipated. Being the only individual of his party who was provided with an angling apparatus, he had the sport entirely to himself, the sailors being passive but not silent spectators of his operations. And a strange wild spot it was. The pulls upon his line were hearty, vigorous jerks, such as a bullock might make at the end of a rope, and when his struggling captives came up, open-mouthed, from the watery abyss, they seemed like some fabled animals of olden times, such strange nondescript things they were. Huge, green, frog-like monsters, with veritable horns and fiery eyes, (the lophyii of zoology;) great pigheaded Balistes, with long, slimy, whiskers, and grotesque trunkfish, with their bony cuirasses, successively greeted his eyes, and as they lay floundering around him on the ice, seemed at each bound upon their uneasy bed to threaten a direct attack upon their captor. They were such fish as one catches in dreams, and Dick found himself listening with strange interest to the ominous remarks of his companions in regard to them. 
               "You need never tell me that is a fish," said one, pointing to one of the most uncouth of the victims, "nor that any good will ever come of deceiving and murdering sich a creature. There's them below that knows it, and is looking up at us now, with their great glassy eyes, through the green sea-water, and if the young gentleman keeps on, he may get something fast to his hook that he'll repent of the longest day of his life. If my advice is taken, he will put them all gently back in the sea as quickly as possible." 
               "With an apology, I suppose," said Dick, laughing. 
               "Aye, an apology might not be amiss," said the sailor; "but I'd put them back at all events, and go quietly home to the ship. At any rate, here's one to lead the way," and he turned his back upon the fishermen, and returned to the vessel, whither two of his companions followed him, leaving only Granite Joe in company with Richard. 
               Scarcely had the superstitious man ceased to speak, before Dick's attention was aroused by a pull of unprecedented violence upon the line, which nearly threw him down, and which, impelling him forward quite to the edge of the aperture, almost served to justify the belief that some invisible power was seeking to draw him beneath the wave. Before he could fairly recover himself another and another twitch ensued, each more violent than the preceding, and Dillon found all his strength requisite to hold his line. 
               "Help, Joe, help!" he exclaimed, "I've hooked a Triton this time, I believe; help, or we shall lose him." 
               "Some things are better lost than won," said Joe, grasping the line; "howsomever, I'll do as you say. Triton, or the d-l, it's all one to Granite Joe." 
               Richard's line was a stout cord, almost capable of holding a shark, and his angle, which was one of a number that he had procured for fishing on the Grand Bank, resembled a small pot-hook, yet he expected momentarily that one or the other would yield to the great strain upon them, as his unseen captive continued Jo leap and plunge beneath the ice. But he paid out the line rapidly, in order to save it, and then, watching his opportunity, drew it gradually in while the monster rested, and again let it forth, when the struggles recommenced. He hoped thus to tire out his antagonist, and draw it at last, unresisting to the surface, where, he thought, if its own evolutions did not throw it out upon the ice, Joe might possibly be willing to venture his iron fist within its gills, and assist to raise it. As to lifting it by the hook and line alone, he felt certain it was altogether impracticable. 
               But the contest was not destined to a speedy termination. Half an hour elapsed, and both Richard and Joe gave far more signs of exhaustion than did the opposite party, whose efforts at release rather increased than abated in force. 
               "Mayhap we'd better give it up," said the tar, at length, looking hesitatingly at his companion, "he's an ugly customer, you see." 
               "Not for twenty pounds," replied Dick, whose sportsman spirit was fairly aroused; "we'll have him at the surface in less than half an hour, but how to raise him when we get him there is the question. Do you think, Joe,' he continued, unconsciously sinking his voice into a soft, insinuating tone, "do you think you would venture your hand into his gills?" 
                
               "I must see him first, before I can answer that, you know, Mr. Dillon," replied Joe; "but, to speak plainly, I think it rather improbable. Any thing to oblige you, you know; but you see he might take it into his head to close hatches, and dart down into the sea, and then where should I be, Mister Dillon?" 
               "Very true," said Richard; "it would hardly be safe, I suppose. Go then to the ship, and procure a boat-hook; I think I can manage him until your return, for I am certain he grows more quiet." 
               "Aye, aye, sir, that's it; I'll be back in a twinkling," replied the sailor, and started on a run toward the vessel. 
               Dick found, his self-imposed task no light one during the ten or fifteen minutes that his assistant was absent, and, at times, he feared that he should really be obliged to abandon hook and line to the enemy, or endanger the dislocation of his arm;, but Joe at length returned, to his great relief, armed with the required implement. About the same time, also, the animal became more quiet, and Dick exulted loudly, as he found that he was able to restrain the successive gatherings of his line without much opposition, and that his prey was slowly approaching the surface. 
               And now an intense curiosity filled the minds of the sportsmen, to discover what kind of fish they had hooked, and both leaned for over the well-hole, peering into its depths, to catch an early view of their rising victim. What was their astonishment, nay, terror, on doing so, to hear something like a groan or sob, coming up through the water, and to behold, at the next instant, a huge open mouth, and a pair of glaring, blood-shot eyes, ascending towards them, which seemed more like those of some wild beast of the forest than of a denizen of the quiet waters. 
               "There! there! that's enough of him," said the sailor," recoiling several steps, "let him go, Mr. Dillon, if he will, and good riddance to him." 
               "Never!" said Dick, excitedly, "fish or fiend, I'll land him on this ice. Now, then, bring your hook! quick, my boy, before he recovers breath. Plant it fairly in his left gill there, and we'll raise together. Quick, he's quiet now." 
               Joe approached trembling, and gave another apprehensive glance into the water, before venturing to obey, for a superstitious fear, the only cowardice to which he was subject, had fully taken possession of his mind. It was not, however, the dimensions of the animal, as much as its fierce and singular aspect that alarmed the sailor, for it was less than six feet in length, and of no extraordinary bulk. 
               "You don't think it's one of them onnateral things that you call Tritons, or any thing of that sort, Mr. Dillon?" asked Joe, in a half-whisper, as he approached slowly, hook in hand, but afraid to strike. 
               "No, no, don't be a fool, Joe, you are too old a man for that. It's a fish, I assure you; probably one of the species known as the sea-wolf; and all we have to do is to land him, and then keep out of his way, until he is dead, for they are said sometimes to attack men, even when out of water; but, fortunately, he has no legs to chase us with." 
               "You don't know that," said joe, shaking his head; "he may have his legs in his pocket, and puts them on when he wants them; I've heard of stranger things than that;" but advancing, as he spoke, with renewed courage to the attack. 
               Strong as a lion, and resolute as strong, the sailor, being now convinced that he had nothing spiritual to deal with, atoned for his remissness, by extraordinary energy and skill. Thrusting the long boat-hook within one of the opened gills of the fish, and uttering a professional 'yeave, ho!' which was the signal for Dillon to draw upon the line, their united efforts raised the animal half out of the water, and gave direction to one of its own convulsive movements, which completed the work. Their prize now lay floundering upon the ice, and the exulting victors, having first hastily pushed him far enough from the aperture to prevent his bounding back into the sea, took off their hats, and gave a number of irregular cheers, which were led off by Dick, and which his companion thought he never would have done with. 
               They next proceeded to examine their captive, which proved to be, as Richard had suspected, a goby; or sea-wolf, an inhabitant of the northern seas, but which is sometimes met with on our coasts. It was known to the young man only by a description of the species, and an engraving, which he had seen, and the marked traits of which he well remembered, for the goby has too decided an individuality of character to be easily mistaken for any other of the ichthyocol use. The peculiar color and physiognomy of its head, and its large teeth give it a striking resemblance to a beast of prey, and when attacked by fishermen, and unable to escape, it is said to fight with the ferocity of a lion. But Joe's fears of its carrying a spare set of legs, to be assumed on an emergency, fortunately, did not prove well founded; at all events the animal made no attempt to put on these auxiliary members, and paid no especial regard to its captors in any way, but continued for a long time to perform the most surprising saltatory feats, uttering each time, as it struck the ice in its descent, a sighing sound, similar to the one which the fishermen had heard in the water. 
               Long intent upon examining so strange an animal, and trying to devise means to hasten its death, in order to convey it to the ship, Richard and his companion did not notice that the sun was approaching the horizon, that heavy clouds were rising in the west to meet it, and that the zephyrs, which an hour before were pleasantly fanning their cheeks, had now grown into a breeze, and were giving premonitions of a gale. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER VIII. 
               THE portentous aspect of the heavens was quickly discovered on board the Blazer, and was watched with no light solicitude by its vigilant commander, but it was not until the shadows of the rising clouds fell upon the chessboard at which Mr. Niles and Elsie were seated, deeply absorbed, that any alarm was sounded in behalf of the individuals who were absent from the vessel. 
               "Oh, Mr. Niles," exclaimed Elsie, suddenly rising, "here is a storm coming on, and that imprudent Richard has not returned. See, he has not even started yet, and it is already beginning to rain." 
               "I dare say he is having some rare sport, or he would not risk a wet jacket," replied Niles, looking off through his eye-glass; and then stepping towards the companion-ladder, he inquired of one of the sailors who was lounging beside the capstan, if any tidings had been received from Mr. Dillon. 
               "Oh, yes, sir," was the reply; "Granite Joe has been back after a boat-hook, to help haul up sum-mat very wonderful that they caught out there; but, I'm thinking sir, they'd better quit skylarking, and be thinking of coming home, for, d'ye see, in half an hour, the fog will be all around us here, like wool, and we shan't be able to see from one end of the vessel to the other." 
               "Ah! why do you think so?" inquired Niles, earnestly. 
               "Think so?" replied the tar; "don't I see it coming, sir? Rolling along like smoke on the prai ries-look off here to the west." 
               Mr. Niles looked and saw that a very heavy fog was really gathering so rapidly as to give it the appearance which the sailor described, of moving in a body towards them, and turning to Elsie, who was listening with great interest to the sailor's words, he said- 
               "Your brother ought certainly to return; the wind is rising fast, and the night is close at hand." 
               "Oh, pray do call him, my good man," exclaimed Elsie, addressing the sailor, who immediately, placing his hands trumpet like around his mouth, sent forth a loud, clear hilloa, which rang far and wide over the waters, and was answered by many echoes from the ice-hills, but not by Dick. 
               "Try again," said Niles; "you have the voice of a Stentor-it is impossible he should not hear." 
               "Oh, that was only a whisper," replied the other, "but I thought it would do; now for it!" and again his long "hil-lo-o-a!" rang forth with astonishing volume, and again the far reverberations were heard, but no other reply. 
               "It is extraordinary that Mr. Dillon should continue fishing in the rain, is it not?" said Niles. 
               "He don't seem to be fishing," said Mr. Popham, who had been attracted on deck from below by the shouts, and was now pointing his little telescope towards the sportsmen; "they appear to be beating something with sticks; it looks like a man down on the ice. I really hope that it aint one of them Esquimaux, that's floated down here on the floe," he added solemnly, "'cause they've no right to kill him, you know, in that way, and it would be murder by the laws of the 'Nited States." 
               "It's the fish!" replied the sailor, excitedly-"they must have got him out, a monster that they have had hooked for an hour and a half, sir; Granite Joe told us all about it." 
               "And they have been too busily engaged with him to notice the coming storm," added Niles. "Pray, my man, make one more effort to make them hear, and if it don't succeed, we'll get the captain to fire a gun." 
               "It's no use, sir-begging your pardon; breath is too precious to be wasted agin a risin' nor'wester, and I've done my best already." 
               "Perhaps not," replied Niles, tossing the man a half sovereign-"try, at all events." 
               The sailor's eye brightened as he pocketed the coin, and, springing upon the tafferel, he planted himself as firmly as if he feared his approaching exertion might take him off his feet, and once more placed his hands tube-like around his mouth. Choosing a more familiar phrase, and one which better admitted of emphasis and prolongation, he sent forth in clear, trumpet-like notes, the sailor's cry of "Ship ahoy!" dwelling with a rising inflection upon the final syllable, until he started the storm-petrel from many an icy perch, and frightening a majesticalbatross from a far distant hummock, sent him wheeling loftily through the air. 
               "They hear! they hear!" exclaimed a dozen voices, as the sportsmen were now plainly seen to turn around and look towards the ship, and then to wave a hat in token of recognition. 
               Various signals were immediately made to the adventurers, to signify their danger, and call them home, and, although it was doubtful whether any of these were observed, it soon became apparent that they were about setting out on their return. It seemed as if they had only that moment become cognizant of the rising storm, or at least that they had entertained no idea of any peculiar peril with which it threatened them, until the solicitude manifested for them on shipboard awakened their apprehensions. 
               The wind was momentarily increasing, without seeming to prevent or disperse the fog which was fast settling on every side, and the day, darkened by dense clouds, was drawing to a premature close, when they started for the vessel, whence every rod of their progress was watched by hundreds, assembled in different groups, on the quarter-deck, amidships, and on the forecastle. 
               "How very slowly they come!" exclaimed the mother of Richard, speaking in a tremulous voice, and but faintly discerning the dim figures in the failing light. 
               "They are dragging something after them," said Adonijah, lowering his glass; "perhaps it is a fish or a seal." 
               "Aye, aye, that's it-never fear for Dick," added Mr. Dillon, striving to disguise his solicitude; "he is too good a sportsman not to be able to take care of himself-but perhaps the man there had better shout to him again to hurry a little." 
               Thus bidden, the sailor, who was yet chuckling over his golden fee, sent forth a succession of shouts, to which the whistling wind, having now found its own voice, added a moaning chorus, and swept the mingled sounds back to the ship, and across it, far away toward the open sea. 
               "There's not the least danger," repeated Mr. Dillon to his trembling wife; "but I wonder they should come so slowly, though of course they do not want to leave their game behind, whatever it is. Bless me, how dark it grows!" 
               "If you please, sir, I think the ship is moving," said a seaman, addressing the captain, cap in hand; "the outside ice is all in motion, sir." 
               "Good God!" exclaimed Dillon; "don't let her go, captain, or my boy is lost." 
               "I can't stop her, 'Squire," replied Nathan; "she's the prisoner of the ice, and must go when that goes, of course; but I'll do my best to keep alongside the floe, if it's only for three minutes, for if Granite Joe hasn't lost all his wits, they'll be here before that time." 
               The peril was now so imminent, and so apparent to all, that, so far from it being necessary to invoke any one to call to the absentees, a dozen voices were heard simultaneously shouting to them, most prominent among which was that of the frantic father, who had rushed to the side of the ship, and leaning far over the gunwale, called in tones of terrific force to his son- 
               "Run, Richard! run, for your life! Run, my boy, run! The ship is moving! Run, run!" 
               And the hoarse, wild cry of "Run! run! the ice is moving! run!" continued to ascend from many voices in accents that plainly told the fears of those who uttered them. 
               Nor were they without effect. The alarm was evidently taken by Richard and his companion, who were seen at first to quicken their pace, but still dragging their prize after them, and then, as the shoutings and gestures upon the ship increased, to relinquish the fish and start forward at a headlong rate. But, alas! the ship was already detached from the icy continent, by which she had so long been moored, and although every thing was done that could be effected by the agency of the wheel, to keep her in position, it was apparent that a few minutes must inevitably remove her to a point inaccessible to the floe. Still the wild cry of "Run! run! for your lives!" echoed across the waters, and the panting fugitives dashed forward with amazing velocity. Yet they were full forty rods distant, and every second, nay, every breath of time, diminished their chances of gaining the receding vessel. In the excitement of the moment, all had some plan of aid to propose, yet Mr. Niles alone, of Richard's friends, preserved sufficient coolness to give rational directions for assistance. At his suggestion a boat containing men and ropes, was lowered to within a few feet of the loose ice, that now heaved and rolled beneath them, and which it would have been instant destruction for any boat to touch, and it was hoped that by this means the men might be rescued, if the ship could be kept within a few rods of the floe until their arrival at its edge. 
               All the stateliness and rigidity of manner of the young Englishman had disappeared, and his whole demeanor was marked by energy and animation. Now he had an encouraging voice for the distracted relatives of Richard, and now he leant over the descending boat, and infused valor and enthusiasm into its irresolute crew by the magical words which followed them down the ship's side, yet reached no other ears- 
               "Five hundred pounds, if you save Mr. Dillon!" 
               No effort was, of course, left untried; but when Richard and his companion arrived, breathless with haste and alarm, at the edge of the floe, the ship was already a dozen rods distant, and in the intervening space high waves were rolling and dashing, with no little din, myriads of ice-blocks against each other. The noise proceeding from the last named cause, together with the whistling of the wind, defeated most of the attempts to converse across the turbid interval; but now and then a shout, aided by a favoring flaw, was heard and responded to. But, alas! every attempt at aid served only to prove its utter impossibility. Again and again was the loaded rope flung toward the floe, only to be swept back by the wind, or dragged down by its own weight into the water, and all the while the ship, diverging at a slight angle from the margin of the ice, was increasing slowly but surely her distance from it. To add to the general despair, night was closing rapidly in, and the forms of the unfortunate men were growing faint and indistinct in the lessening light. 
               "My son! my son!" shrieked the agonized father, scarcely restrained from leaping into the sea, while every heart was electrified with horror as the clear voice of of young Dillon came sweeping by on the wind- 
               "Good-bye, father-mother-all!" 
               Tears rained from every eye, and with anguish unspeakable Richard's friends thronged around Captain Stone, imploring that he would set sail and try to return to the floe. 
               "She must go with the ice," he replied, imperturbably, "onless you want us all to go to the bottom together. There's no knowing how soon we may be aleak as it is, Squire Dillon; and as to trying to beat up again these great clashing ice-cakes, it would be certain destruction; wood can't stand it, sir, nor copper neither." 
               "But you can stand 'off and on,' can't you, sir?" said Niles-" and keep nearly your present position until the storm abates?" 
               "We can stand off," said Nathan, emphatically, "and it is our only safe course; for we are much too near the floe as it is, with such a sea rising as this. Can't you see that if we should be driven again that coast of ice, the Blazer would be at the bottom in five minutes?" 
               "But think of two human lives-" 
               "Think of two hundred human lives, Mr. Niles, that I am bound to pertect, sir, besides the ship and the cargo." 
               "But, my dear sir-" 
               "No, no, no-I tell you it won't do; I pity them as much as you, and I know it's a dreadful thing to desert them; and possibly, if the storm shouldn't last long, we may pick them up yet-possibly!" 
               "What do you really think are the chances of doing so?" asked Niles, approaching a few steps nearer to the captain, and sinking his voice, so as not to be heard by the others. 
               "Well, sir, to be candid, I think it would be idle to calkilate on ever seeing them agin, for either the motion of the sea will in a few hours break up the whole field into drift-ice, or, if it continues solid, we shall be thirty miles off from it before morning, in spite of any thing we can do." 
               "But will it not travel in the same direction with us, sir?" 
               "Yes-but very slowly compared to the motion of these millions of loose pieces, which, as you see, extend for miles, on three sides of us; we must go quietly with them, until either we get out of them altogether, or until the storm lulls." 
               "But we can return?" 
               "Days, or a week hence, by a roundabout course, to avoid this very drift, we may, and if the floe holds together, we may possibly find them, or their bodies-possibly, I say, but the chance is poor enough." 
               "Alas! what must be their feelings of suspense!" 
               "Bless you, sir, they know it's all over with them. Granite Joe knows just as well as I do that we can't save them; and he has told Mr. Dillon of it before this, you may depend, sir; and that was the reason he called 'good-bye' a little while ago. As old a seaman as Granite Joe to git caught in such a scrape as that! I can't imagine how he could have been so stupid." 
               "It was all owing to that monster fish, which so engrossed their attention, but you certainly ought to have foreseen the danger." 
               "And so I should have done, in course, for I have been watching the weather all day; but I thought they were all in, until I heard the shouting for them. I saw several come back, and supposed that they all had, for I knew my men were all old sea-dogs, and I thought they were able to take care of themselves, but it seems I was mistaken." 
               Mr. Niles turned back to the anxious group, who had awaited with indefinite hope the result of his conference with the master, but though he spoke a few vague words of cheer, his mournful and disturbed countenance contradicted his speech, and deepened the despair of his auditors. The gale was still increasing, and the rain had for many minutes been pouring unheeded upon the melancholy choly party, but it was only when both the heart-broken mother and the affectionate Elsie gave symptoms of swooning that they could be induced to retire into the cabin. Thither the rest of the party, with the exception of Captain Stone, soon followed them, to renew their consultations and conjectures, the night having closed so rapidly in that not the slightest trace of the floe remained visible. 
               A chart was produced, and, being spread upon a table, beneath the swinging lights, was anxiously scanned by many tear-filled eyes, while the position and direction of the vessel was indicated, and all the chances of escape were discussed. But ere an hour had elapsed, other elements began to enter into the calculations of this mournful congress, and grief for their deserted companions became merged in apprehensions for the general safety, for the gale had grown into a tempest, the ship was being driven crashing through the icy highway, and the appalling consciousness of the most extreme peril forced itself on every mind. If they could have deceived themselves into a doubt of this terrible truth, the undisguised alarm of the officers of the vessel, and the many and loudly shouted orders and responses that were ringing upon deck, would have prevented their doing so. 
               For eight long hours consternation filled every heart, and when the dawning day gave glimpses of the open sea a few miles distant, restoring hope of their own escape, no one dared longer to believe that their unfortunate companions survived. As personal fears abated, grief for the lost grew deeper, but it was now such grief as is felt for the buried dead. No portion of the immense island of ice, which for so many days had bounded their view to the north and west, remained visible, but far as the eye could reach in that direction extended the same loose drift which surrounded their vessel without preventing its progress, and which rose and fell everywhere with the heaving waves. 
               Through all that day and the succeeding night the storm continued with but little abatement, forbidding any attempt at search for the unfortunate men; and when on the second day, the falling sea and changing wind allowed the vessel to be put about, it was done by Captain Stone, rather to avoid losing the remotest chance of rescue than with any inspiriting hopes of success. The ice had been much dispersed by the long continued agitation of the sea, and it was easy to return nearly upon the track over which they had passed without serious obstruction. Broad openings extended in every direction, in some cases a mile in width, and reaching northward as far as could be seen, and there seemed little probability that these divided sections of the field would re-unite, so as to again become formidable to the vessel. 
               It was with few fears, therefore, for his ship, that the humane captain gratified at once his own inclinations and the earnest wishes of his passengers, by prosecuting for three entire days the search for the lost men. As they drew near the scene of the disaster, they found to their surprise that a considerable portion of the island still remained entire, and hopes were slightly revived, but only to be again speedily extinguished. No trace of the sufferers could be found. Guns were fired at intervals for several hours, and the main ice was sailed entirely around by the Blazer; indeed the good-natured Nathan did not propose to abandon the search, until Mr. Niles and Mr. Popham, as the friends of the mourning family, had expressed their entire satisfaction with his efforts, and their full conviction that it would be useless to continue them any longer. 
               A sad and solemn hour to the voyagers was that in which the vessel's course was once more changed, and all knew that the search was finally abandoned. It was like the silent return-from the grave, when its portals have newly closed over the remains of the loved and lost, and the hearts of the survivors feel, for the first time, a a sense of their loneliness and desolation. 
             
             
               CHAPTER IX. 
               WHEN Richard Dillon and his hardy companion first discovered that the ship which they had left so firmly blockaded was in motion, and was receding from the main ice, their fears were seriously excited; but when, on arriving at the edge of the floe, they saw the wide and raging gulf which separated them from the vessel, the alarm of Richard became excessive, while that of the sailor, strangely enough, seemed to subside. This, however, was only seeming, on the part of the mariner, who was a man of iron nerve, remarkable for his self-possession in moments of danger, and whose mind, while really appreciating all the imminency of the peril, became tranquil with the very effort to find relief. 
               "There is but one chance, Mister Dillon," he said, mildly, but quickly; "and that is to swim under water to the ship. What say you? It is but a little way." 
               "I never did such a thing in my life," answered Richard as hastily, "it is impossible for me!" 
               "Oh, that alters the case, then," returned Joe, coolly: "for it requires a great deal of practice to do that sort of thing." 
               "But you, Joseph, can do it?" 
               "I? Why, bless you, yes, sir," said the sailor, quite leisurely; "I swam once nearly half a mile in that are way, only coming up oncet in twenty rods to breathe. I'll tell you how it was-you see-" 
               "But do not waste time; save your life while you can. Be quick, for heaven's sake, or you, too, will be lost!" 
               "And leave you here?" 
               "Yes, you see you cannot help me, my good fellow, so do not throw away your life. They may possibly rescue me, but you can make your escape certain." 
               "And leave you here?" repeated Joe, slowly, as if entertaining the proposition, and reflecting on it. 
                
               "Certainly." 
               "No, no, boy. I can't do that, you know. It would go very hard with you out here, all alone, you see, and it was sort o' my fault that you got into the trouble." 
               "But, Joseph-" 
               "No, no, sir, don't say a word about it. My maximum is, never o desert a friend in danger; and I should never hold up my head agin, if I should leave such a boy as you alone out here. I should never sleep another night after it." 
               While the sailor was making these remarks, he was walking along the margin of the ice, watching the futile efforts of his associates on shipboard to fling a rope across the interval. 
               "It aint no use, that aint," he said, shaking his head; "but it shows good will. If they had a good swimmer that they could send out with a rope, summat might possibly be done. I don't know but one man on board as could do it, and that is a fisherman emigrant, that swam three times under the ship from bow to stern, the day afore we sailed, for a wager." 
               "You don't think we can be saved, then?" asked Richard, faintly. 
               "Probably not," replied Joe, with the utmost coolness, "but we shall see, you know." 
               It was at this period that young Dillon, overcome by affectionate regrets for the friends who were so rapidly departing from him, sent his wild cry of farewell across the water. 
               The subsequent efforts for their rescue were, of course, watched with the most intense interest by the unfortunate men, and when all proved unavailing, and the ship grew indistinct to their view, and night descended upon the sea, another night, deeper and darker, settled upon the heart of the young Englishman, extinguishing in its cloudy folds the light of many ardent hopes and manly aspirations. 
               "It aint no use to despair," said the sailor, speaking after a long silence of both parties; "we must get through the night the best way we can, and perhaps in the morning summat will turn up. Where's the dog?" 
               Richard whistled for Dash, who instantly made his appearance, from somewhere in the surrounding darkness, like Ariel at the call of Prospero. 
               "Keep him near us-we may want him," said Joe. 
               Dick wondered what service the hound could possibly be employed on for their benefit, but he felt too heavy-hearted to converse, and asked no questions. 
               "They'll raise a light pretty soon," added the sailor; "and then we shall see where they are." 
               "Oh, will they indeed?" asked the young man hastily, for the idea seemed to him to have something of hope in it. 
               "Yes, but it won't do us any good though, you know; it will only show us how far off they are, and very soon the fog will prevent our seeing it altogether." 
               "How far off is the vessel probably now?" 
               "Not more'n a quarter of a mile?" 
               "And how far will it be an hour hence?" 
                
               "Two or three miles." 
               "And in the morning?" 
               "From twenty to thirty, most likely." 
               "And where shall we be then?" said Richard, continuing his questions, earnestly, as if he thought his companion had the gift of foresight. 
               "Well, that's mighty onsartain, young man. The sea is getting pretty high, as you perceive, and these here floes usually break up during storms. We may be a long way from here." 
               Dillon looked in the face of his companion to see if there was any deeper meaning in his remark than the words literally implied, but evidently nothing figurative was intended. 
               "You do not mean, I presume," he said, hopefully, "that they break up into small pieces?" 
               "Yes, smallish rather," replied the sailor, struggling between his love of truth and his desire to encourage Richard," like that drift-ice off there. If you listen between those puffs of wind now, you'll hear a crackling a long way off, something like the report of a pistol." 
               "Good heavens! You do not mean to say that is the ice breaking up?" 
               "I'm afraid it is, Mr. Dillon; did not like to mention it, but I thought you must hear it yourself. You see it isn't in the natur of ice to stand such a racking and tossing up and down as those great waves give it. Why, when I was on board the whale-ship Judith, in the north seas-" 
               "But, never mind that now, if you please. Is there not something we can do to avoid, or atleast to postpone the horrible fate which threatens us?" 
               "Well, Mister Dillon, I like to be candid, and I suppose it is my duty to tell you plainly now what I think about it. You are a young man, and in course life is sweet to you, and you kind o' cling to it. That's very nateral, that is, for you. With me the case is summat different. I am old and poor, and I have seen a mighty deal of trouble, and it's often and often that I have looked o' nights, from my watch on the forec'sle, down into the deep waters of these very seas and felt as though it would be an uncommon relief to go down there and forget all. I wouldn't do it purposely, you know, sir, and can't say I wish it now, for don't the Bible say that no self-murderer shall inherit the kingdom of Heaven? But I should feel as if I wasn't losing much, excepting sorrow. I could tell you a sad yarn, I could indeed; but I won't trouble you with it only as you see I am growing old in this 'ere service, and nothing laid by, and no snug harbor to ride at anchor in; and then they are all gone as I cared for, except one, and he might better be with us here tonight than where he is-and-and-that is all." 
               "I am really very sorry for you, my good fellow," replied Richard, forgetting their common peril in his sympathy, "and if you choose, I think I can get father to do something for you, to enable you to quit the sea, when we- that is to say-I mean if we should escape. You did not, after all give me your opinion-don't be afraid to speak plainly, and let me know the worst." 
               "Well, Mister Dillon," answered the sailor, with simplicity, "Providence can save us, of course; this storm may go down before morning, though it aint likely to, by my calculation, short of forty-eight hours-and then this drift-ice may be all cleared away, which aint very likely neither-and then Captain Stone may come back and find us, and send off a boat and save us, which is least likely of all-but all this is possible." 
               "But you seem to limit the power of Providence?" 
               "No, sir, I don't mean that; but these aint the days of meracles. Providence could save us in a powder-magazine, when a howt'zer shell was bursting in it-but it wouldn't, sir, depend on that-we should be blown up. If we had been going to be saved, we should have been kept away from there; at that particular time." 
               "Then you think," asked Richard, despairingly, "that there is scarcely any hope for us?" 
               "Very nearly none at all," said Joe, "for a man must speak the full truth under these circumstances, you know-just listen to that!" 
               A succession of loud reports similar to those they had before heard reached their ears, and seemed to Richard like the voice of doom. 
               "Still," added the sailor, "we must not throw away the few chances We have. Where is the dog?" 
               "Dash is here," replied Richard, much surprised; "why do you ask?" 
               "We may want him. Let us go back also to the Goby, as you call him, and keep as near him as possible. If the ice should not break small, we may possibly all keep on one piece through the night. Sometimes these drifts have blocks containing nearly a square acre; but this storm, I fear, won't leave its work half done." 
               Mr. Dillon now comprehended the meaning of his companion, who, while calmly expecting the worst, was still exercising the wisest foresight to make available the few elements of aid which they possessed. The fish and the dog were evidently his reliance for food, in the event of their being able to retain a position upon the ice for any considerable length of time, and being in any extremity of suffering from hunger. 
               They accordingly retraced their steps to the place where they had left the sea-wolf, which was now entirely dead, and making a seat of his body, they prepared, dismally enough, to pass the night in this strange resting-place. The darkness was intense, the storm raged violently around them, and the loud crashing of the loose ice against the margin of the floe, interspersed with the frequent Cannon-like reports of the main body, shattered by the heaving sea, presented a combination of terrors, alleviated solely by the thought that they admitted of no augmentation. 
                
               Richard tried hard to lose a realizing sense of his situation, and to believe that he was the victim of some dreadful dream, while in reality enjoying the shelter and safety of a home; but he could not for a single moment divest his spirit of its heavy burden of despair. Solemn reflection took the place of conversation, and for several hours but few sentences were interchanged between the unfortunate men. When they again conversed freely, the great mystery of death and a future existence were their themes, and they found to their satisfaction that, wide apart as had been the places of their birth, and diverse as had been their education and their aims in life, they stood on a common platform of religious faith, the broad extent of which upholds in every clime its millions of hopeful hearts. Richard had been educated in the Church of England, and the sailor had received his religious tuition in the Wesleyan branch of Dissenters, which, acknowledging the former as its parent tree, numbers in its zealous ranks so many millions of the humbler classes of society. 
               "If so be as we are to go, Mister Dillon," said the sailor, "we must try to go cheerily, and because He calls who has the right. Death, You see, can't really be a great calamity, because it comes to the whole univarsal world, and always did, not excepting the good and holy men." 
               "Very true," replied Richard, who did not fail to perceive that his unlettered companion was expressing in humbler diction the exact sentiment of a great German philosopher and moralist. 
               "The great secret will be explained to us," continued the sailor, "for we are all under a cloud here, at the best, Mister Dillon; though the Gospel light pierces through it, and shows our way upwards, yet there is the cloud, you see, still, for what do we, or even the wisest of men, know about the great works?" 
               "Very little, certainly." 
               "Aye, well may you say that, you who are so young; and yet the older one grows the more they feel its truth, and the more cause they see for wonder and awe and humbleness." 
               Such was the beginning of a colloquy which lasted nearly an hour, and during which the sailor gave abundant proof that he had been a profound thinker on the great problem of human life and destiny, and on the wonders of the material world. But their discussion was interrupted in a sudden and fearful manner. 
             
             
               CHAPTER X. 
               SEVERAL faint crackling noises were heard in the distance, in various directions, all of which gradually grew louder, and seemed to be approaching them, until with stunning sound they rung at their very feet, and the heaving ice, and the gurgling of the water uprisen upon it, told the whole dreadful tale of calamity. Richard instinctively ively caught hold of his companion, as he felt the swaying motion beneath him, and the sailor at the same moment grasping him by the arm, dragged him along in the direction whence, as his quick had detected, fewest of the noises had proceeded, and where he expected to find a firmer footing. 
               "This is a largish block we are, on now, and more safer," he said, calmly, speaking first, after they had stopped. 
               "It is only postponing our fate a few minutes," replied Richard; "hear how these dreadful waves are chasing us, like some wild animals greedy for their prey. Ah! my poor father! mother! sisters!" 
               "Courage, my boy," said Joe, "we are alive yet; but I am afraid we have lost the Goby." 
               "What do you mean? Don't you see that in five minutes the ice must all be ground up into fragments?" 
               "P'raps not, Mister Dillon; leastways I don't think so, 'cause now it's once broke, and separated like, so as to give the waves play between, the larger pieces, especially if they are pretty thick, are likely to hold together for some hours. I have, been measuring the one we are on at the edge with the boat-hook, and only see, or rather feel how thick it is!-up to there, sir; give me your hand, and feel of it, for you can't see any thing, of course, in this darkness." 
               Richard examined the stick as he was desired, but notwithstanding the cheerful tone of his companion, he gathered little or no courage. 
               "We may gain a few more hours of suffering and suspense," he said; "but it is hardly to be desired." 
               "Tut! tut! Mister Dillon-don't talk like that, now; we may breakfast on board the Blazer, after all; any way, we must breakfast somewhere, and we've lost the fish, you see-where's Dash?" 
               "Horrible!" exclaimed Dillon; "why will you torture me thus?" 
               "Call to him, Mr. Dillon," said Joseph, anxious not only to recover the dog, but to give to the mind of the young man some other employment than brooding over the fearful fate which seemed to await them; "call to him, we may really need him very much, if we should be on this 'ere raft three or four days-call to him, he may be within hearing." 
               Richard obeyed, both calling and whistling to the hound, whose voice was soon heard in the distance, answering the summons with protracted whines, and it soon became evident that the animal was separated from them by a considerable interval of the open sea. It was not, indeed, until after repeated calls that it was induced to take the water, and Richard could not avoid a sensation of shame and guilt, when he thought of the possible purpose for which he was luring his faithful companion to his side. 
               "I, at least, will never touch him," he muttered, "though it is doubtless right that the sailor should have him if he wishes. Poor Dash!" 
                
               "It's only as a last resort, you know," added Joe; "but, you see, a meal or two might help us hold out at some very critical time, when help might be near." 
               "You do really think, then, there is a possibility," said Richard, over whose despairing heart a sudden burst of Hope's warm sunlight spread. 
               "Yes, a possibility," replied Joseph, guardedly, and the cloud and the chill came back to his companion's breast. 
               Dash soon reached them in a great state of delight, which he testified by leaping repeatedly upon Richard, who was scarcely less rejoiced than the brute at their reunion. He instinctively refrained, however, from fondling him as usual, only patting him on the head and exclaiming "Poor Dash!" in a tone that seemed to impart to the dog some idea of their common misfortune, for he immediately crouched at his master's feet, where he lay for many minutes, uttering a succession of low, whining sounds. 
               The night, of course, seemed of interminable length to the sufferers, who began to watch for the dawn, hours before there was any possibility of its appearance, and Richard began to wonder whether some great change might not be taking place in the material world which would altogether prevent the return of day. Grief and terror had so racked his mind, that it was an easy prey to the wildest fancies. There seemed to him something unusually gloomy and portentous in the roaring of the sea-there seemed to be whisperings and spirit-voices in the wind, as it swept fitfully past him, and went shrieking away in the distance-and then the darkness was so entire, and so intense, that it was as if the faculty of sight had been entirely withdrawn. 
               "Surely, this night is of an unnatural length," he exclaimed to the sailor after a long pause in the conversation, and a long and fruitless watching for the light. 
               "Mebbe it's one of them are polar, nights come down along with the ice," replied the other with a strange attempt at humor. "It is certainly very long," he continued, "but I remember one summer like it", when I was on a whaling cruise in the Judith, many years ago, off the northwest coast." 
               "What were the circumstances?" 
               "We were in latitude sixty-eight, you see, which was pretty well up, considering the season, for it was along in September, and we were bound southward then toward the Sandwich Islands, not intending to tack or take in sail for any thing less than a hurricane or a seventy-barrel whale, when one afternoon, Mr. Mendel, the second mate, whose tongue had better been cut off, shouted 'There she blows!' And there she did blow, sure enough, about a mile and a half to leeward, like a Missysipper steamboat letting off steam after a race, and she couldn't have been less than ninety barrels if she was a gallon. She was in toward the coast, which was only a few miles off, and in a few minutes we had two boats in chase, the second mate and I being in the forward one in very great glee, for we were both young, and this was the largest whale we had ever attacked." 
               "Were you an officer of the ship?" 
               "I was boat-steerer then, and entitled to command a boat and strike a whale; but we had only two boats ready for service, and as the first and second mates each took one, I went, by permission, with Mendel, who was almost foremost, and who I knew well enough would put in the first harpoon, if the animal was to be touched at all, which was no wise certain, being as night was so near at hand. Well, it was a long chase, old Blubber led us, and we soon lost sight of the ship and the other boat, without comin' in view of the shore." 
               "You overtook the whale at last?" said Richard. 
               "To our sorrow, we did. We got alongside just about sunset. I had the helm, and Mendel the harpoon, (how I envied him his luck!) and one stood by the rope-coil with a hatchet, ready to cut away, if needful, and the rest were at the oars. I begged Mendel very hard, for old acquaintance sake, to let me strike." 
               "What did he say?" 
               "'Not for a hundred dollars,' said he, and them was the last words he ever spoke. I laid the boat close alongside very quietly, and as Mendel raised the harpoon with his great brawny arms, the flash of his eye and the flush of his cheeks, and the tremble of his whole body, showed that he was dreadfully excited, and I wasn't much better, for I riz up in the stern to see the blow, arid bent forrard, without breathin', to watch it. 'Make sure,' says I, and the harpoon flew like a chain shot from his hands, and half buried itself in the vitalest part of the monster; but poor Mendel, in his eagerness, stood looking after it, to see if it held, and neither jumped back nor called 'Stern all!' as was his custom. The whale gave one convulsive shudder, and I, seein' as how nobody spoke, shouted out, 'Stern all!'-but, while the words were sounding, something dark passed, swifter than lightnin,' afore my eyes; there was a crash somewhere, and I felt myself going up into the air, stunned and bewildered, but yet able to see others flying past me, faster and further than I went, and to see the pieces of the boat above my head, and tumbling down with me, back into the water." 
               "Dreadful!" exclaimed Richard. 
               "Aye, well may you say so-dreadful to poor Harry, and one of the oarsmen, who were never seen again by mortal eye, and bad enough for all of us who remained alive." 
               "What could you do?" 
               "There were three of us left, and the only part of the boat that could be found was only large enough to sustain two, so that one had constantly to remain outside in the water, just supporting himself by laying his hands on the hulk, and in that position we took turns, while we consulted on the means for safety, and expected every moment to feel the sharks running away with our legs." 
               "Horrible! Were there really sharks there?" asked Dillon. 
               "If the whale was dead, and near by, we knew they would not be far off; and they might be prowling around any way, for somehow they always seem to be where they aint wanted. The thought of them was mighty onpleasant." 
               "Well, what did you do?" 
               "We passed the night in just that are condition, sir-a night just as dark as this-a night of sixteen hours, sir, and one of us in the water all the time up to the neck, expectin' to be cut in two, and gittin' too desperate to care much if we was. That's what we did, sir-and that wasn't to be the worst of it, either; for just about dawn, which came at last, though we all thought it never would, and it had seemed all of three whole days and nights first, jist about the peep of day the sharks did come, after all." 
               "Terrible! What on earth did you do?" 
               "There was a brave fellow in the water at the time, called Tabor, one of the oarsmen, and all at once was hearn a dreadful groan, and as I looked round toward him I saw red water, and knew at oncet what the matter was. He held on still with his hands, and tried to climb up, but he saw it was of no use, for if he got on, we should all go down, which he knew very well, and it was his turn outside, and he knew, of course, none of us would change with him under such circumstances." 
               "I hope he died quickly." 
               "I handed him my knife, and said, said I, 'P'raps you can fight 'm off, Charley,' and we all leant over and shouted at the devils to try to frighten 'em away; but it warn't no use, for they are just like tigers when they once get the taste of blood-they'd come back, if it was through a shower of cannon balls. 'It's no use.' said he, groaning again, 'that fellow off there has got one of my legs, and here comes another after the rest of me,' and he climbed along with his hands very fast toward the other end of the boat, to get out of the way; but fell of a sudden there was a dart and a flash of something whitish just under the surface of the water, and he was gone, and we felt relieved when his misery was over." 
               "I never heard any thing so shocking," replied Richard; "but I should hardly suppose you would have been safe from them yourselves." 
               "No more we warn't; we had to curl ourselves up in the smallest space possible, and keep up all the noise we could, to try to scare 'em, for they kept darting clust alongside, and running their noses up out of the water, and sniffing at us; but they have to partly turn over before they can bite, because their mouth is on the under side of the head, and every time they tried that, one of us was ready to reach over with a knife, and give 'em a stab." 
               "How long were you in that condition?" 
               "Only about two hours, for as soon as it was broad light, we saw the ship about three, miles off, where it had been standin' off and on all night; for they did not know in what direction we might be, if alive, and did not dare to move, until daylight, for fear of gittin' further off from us. They had had lights out all night, but it was too foggy to see them; and now and then through the night they fired a gun, which we had heard, but could not go, you know, nor make any answering signal. Hows'ever, we saw 'em in the morning, and they saw us with the glass, and down they came as fast as possible, and picked us up." 
               "And so you lost three men?" 
               "Three men, sir, and all for want of a little coolness on the part of the mate; but he paid dearly enough for it, poor fellow, and nobody felt like blaming him after he was gone-and there, sir, unless I am much mistaken, is a little scrap of daylight coming, just off here to the left away.-Don't you think it is?' 
               "God grant it," exclaimed Richard, looking anxiously in the direction indicated, and fancying that he saw a slight change from the pitchy darkness that had prevailed on every side, but scarcely daring to hope that it was really the approach of dawn. They gazed many minutes without intermission, before their hopes received any decided confirmation; but at length very visible rays began to steal over the sky, and the water, revealing gradually the shape of the heavy clouds that hung around the eastern horizon, by shining through the more attenuated portions of them. There was no abatement of the storm or of the waves, yet there was bliss in the thought of returning light. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XI. 
               WHILE Richard pondered silently on his melancholy situation, the eyes of the sailor were earnestly scanning the ocean, in every direction, his erect frame turning slowly, as on a pivot, many times, while he successively faced every point of the compass, and stopped to gaze a few seconds on each. The light was gradually improving, when Dillon's attention was arrested by a change in the conduct of his companion, who had become quite stationary, and was looking steadily and earnestly eastward. 
               "What is it that you see?" inquired the young man, looking anxiously in the same direction, but perceiving only one unvarying blank of heaving wave and lowering sky. 
               No reply for many minutes escaped the lips of the sailor, who remained in his statuelike position, apparently quite absorbed, until again addressed by his companion. 
               "Speak, in the name of Mercy, if you see aught to afford hope. I can discern nothing." 
               "I see a ship!" replied Joseph, who had only waited to make certain of his discovery before proclaiming it. "I see a Ship, and I believe it is the Blazer!" 
                
               No words can express the tumult of delight which filled the heart of the young man on hearing this announcement. 
               "Thank God!" he exclaimed; "then they are really at hand, and are searching for us. We must take all possible means to make ourselves visible." 
               "They are yet many miles off," replied Joseph, "and must come much nearer before there is any probability of their seeing us. It is greatly in our favor that they will be looking for us and with the glass, else I should say it would be highly improbable they would discover us. If we only have not changed our position too much, and if they have kept their reckoning right, they may find us." 
               Richard's heart sank as he heard these calculations, but he placed his trust in the kind Providence which had thus far protected him, and took courage. Yet it was so long before he could himself see the faintest trace of the object which the mariner had so confidently announced, that he began to fear the latter might be laboring under some hallucination, occasioned by their night of suffering. He saw it at length, however, when the morning was farther advanced, about which time it became apparent that the vessel was sailing nearly in a direct line toward them, although from a quarter in which they had no reason to look for the Blazer. 
               Joseph, indeed, soon decided that it was not that ship, but a brig, under light sail, the course of which was doubtless without he least reference to themselves, who must be entirely invisible at that distance, unless by the aid of a good sea-glass. There was every reason to apprehend that as soon as the floating ice was discovered from the brig, her direction would be changed, so as to carry her past them at too remote a distance for hailing. The most intense excitement and trepidation consequently filled the hearts of the unhappy men, who rightly judged that if this source of safety failed them, they had but little reason to expect any other. They made the only signal in their power, by hoisting and waving parts of their garments in the air, by means of the long-handled boat-hook; and, continuing this process without intermission, they awaited the result with the most harrawing anxiety. Every moment they expected to see the course of the brig changed, to avoid the neighborhood of the ice; but onward still it came, as if its pilot were entirely unconscious of any such obstacle in his path, or scorned to turn aside for so slight an impediment. Nearer and nearer, without any divergence, came the Heaven-sent messenger, until her tall masts loomed up in full relief against the sky, and the sailor was able to speak knowingly of her nation and her tonnage. 
               "She is an English brig," he said, "and must be bound either to the 'Nited States or Canada; but she must have a stupid fellow at the wheel, or he would never hold this course so long, and with sich a sea runnin' as this-but he just keeps her straight afore the wind and never sees the ice." 
               "Perhaps, since it is so much broken and scattered, they do not consider it dangerous." 
               "Don't believe that, sir. Nothing wears a ship more than driftice, when the sea is rough; she might a'most as well sail through so many floatin' rocks-besides, sir, only see what large blocks there are here, like this one that we are on, against which she might be driven; no, no, they'll give the field a wide berth as soon as ever they see it, you may depend on that; but it is so cloudy, and the white-capped waves are rolling so, every where, just as white as the ice, and whiter too, that it is very easy to make a mistake until they git clust to." 
               The brig was soon so near that they could perceive figures moving on her decks, and being now animated by the most exciting hope that they must soon be perceived in turn, they used every means to attract attention-the sailor walking about and extending the boat-hook, with its streaming pendants, high as he could reach, and waving it violently, while Richard, by his direction, ran rapidly to and fro on the ice, leaping, flinging his arms about, and tossing his hat into the air. 
               "They'll see us moving a great deal sooner than if we keep still, you see," said the sailor; "and there seems to be many peeple now on the decks; and see how they are running about too!-but, Lord have mercy! she is surely veerin' round toward the South." 
               "Then we are lost!" exclaimed Richard; "they see the ice, and are turning from it." 
               "I don't see how they can see the ice without seein' us," replied Joe; "it's unaccountable, sartain," and he waved his flag with tremendous violence adding loud and prolonged shouts, which the wind only swept back into his face, and carried away in the opposite direction. It was a dreadful moment, and terror paralyzed the miserable men as they gazed; but their anguish was happily brief. The vessel only slightly changed her course, and in a few minutes, to their inexpressible delight, a boat was lowered and put off to their assistance. The attempt was not free from peril, but it was boldly and gallantly persevered in by the hardy sailors, who soon had the satisfaction of receiving the sufferers, and starting on their return to the ship, whence the achievement was watched by a crowd of anxious spectators.-They reached the vessel in safety, and were at once thronged by a multitude of sympathizing people, curious to hear their adventures, and eager to administer to their relief. Richard addressed himself at once to the captain, whom he grasped by the hand and briefly thanked, as earnestly as his choked utterance would permit, and then begged that they might be questioned of nothing until they had received the rest and refreshment of which they stood in perishing need. 
               A hearty response was made to this appeal, and the rescued men were conducted below, and speedily ly supplied with every comfort; which their situation required, while even Dash, who had not been left behind, received his share of "material aid" from those who could not find an opportunity to contribute directly to the assistance of his human companions. 
               It is pleasant to record, that neither the educated gentleman nor the unlearned sailor failed to devote their first minutes of privacy to a grateful acknowledgment to the Divine Power for their signal deliverance; and if from one party the murmured voice of praise went up in the apt and chosen language of the English ritual, and from the other in his own unornamented but earnest words, it would be difficult to say that either was less sincere or less acceptable than the other. 
               Strengthened and cheered by wine and warmth, and dry apparel, they sat down together to a bountiful repast, which the eyes of the famished sailor seemed to devour in advance, and to which both did amplest justice. Richard next hastened to Communicate to the captain and the cabin passengers, of whom there were six or seven, all the particulars of their strange and thrilling adventure eliciting many marks of astonishment and of deep feeling from his hearers, and learning from them, in turn, to his increased satisfaction, that he was on board a fast sailing English vessel, bound to the American metropolis. 
               But blissful as had been the change in his condition, his heart began to be heavy with the thought of what his friends were suffering for him, and he lived in the hourly hope that the Blazer had been descried and would be spoken. Let but the intelligence of his safety be communicated to his relatives, and he felt that he could cheerfully bear a separation from them until they reached their common port, Day after day he anxiously watched the sea for the hoped discovery, and listened to the reports of sails on the weather-bow, and sails on the lee-beam, and sails in various other mysterious places, all of which were invisible to him, and none of which ever came near enough to be spoken or recognized. 
               Ten days passed thus, and then, when he came on deck one fine morning, he was told that he was in the bay of New York, a fact which the gorgeous spectacle that soon afterwards rose to his view fully confirmed. But beautiful as was the harbor and the glittering city which he approached, and bright and green as were the fairy islands which he passed, he had few thoughts to bestow upon them. Had the Blazer arrived? Had his friends preceded him in reaching port, and should he soon be able to clasp them in his arms? And, if so, how could he best and most safely disclose to them the startling intelligence of his escape? These were the agitating questions which continued to occupy his mind until the vessel was moored at her dock. 
               Cordially parting with his new friends, he went on shore, accompanied by Granite Joe, and took rooms at a hotel where he soon learned, through the sailor's inquiries, that the Blazer had not yet reached port, though she had been considered due for several days. No solicitude was entertained for her safety, and he did not himself indulge in any useless fears, but retired to very elevated quarters at an early hour in the evening, and passed his first night ashore in a sleep so profound and so oblivious of all thought or consciousness, as to seemingly contract his ten hours of repose into scarcely more than the same number of minutes. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XII. 
               IF Mr. Dillon had no dreams during the night, there was at least a most grotesque procession of ideas passing through his head about sunrise on the ensuing morning, while awaking under some kind of external influence, he could not tell what, yet he fancied himself being drawn with ropes out of the sea of sleep, amid strange shouts from his rescuers. He heard heavy, hammering sounds somewhere, and the words "I say, Mr. Dillon, the Blazer's below," many times repeated, before he could succeed in attaching any kind of meaning to the language, and when, at length, he did in part comprehend the nature of the intelligence, he remained some seconds under the vague impression that the welcome vessel was in some mysterious manner literally "below" him, and somewhere within the spacious hotel which he inhabited. 
               "Where is she, Joseph?" he asked, opening the door, and letting in the importunate messenger, while at the same time he proceeded to indue himself with his apparel; "where-where is she?" 
               "In the Narrers!" replied Joe. 
               "Where's that?" said Dick, who could only associate the word with the remembered dark passages and halls about the hotel. 
               "About nine or ten miles below, sir." 
               "Nine or ten miles below," repeated Dick, catching a glimpse of the truth, but speaking now with a return of his wonted playfulness; "why that's a great depth, Joe. I remember coming up a very long way indeed last night, but really now I don't think it was as far as that." 
               "It's all of that, sir," said the sailor, now a little off soundings himself; "it's down hereaway, and if it warn't for these ere chimbleys and that are steeple, and the trees, you could see her quite plain from this window. You are high enough up to see a long way outside." 
               "That is quite true; but you are really quite sure it is the Blazer?" asked Richard, proceeding hurriedly with his toilet; "how soon will she be in port?" 
               "In less than two hours, sir." 
               "Bless me! how in the world shall I manage it?" exclaimed Dillon, trying to put his vest on wrong side up. 
               "Topsy-turvy," said Joe. 
                
               "I am afraid I shall," answered the young man. "Oh! it's this you mean, is it? Very true; it would suit me better just now if it were a straight-jacket, I believe. How shall I manage it? I say, Joe, you must by no means go near the ship until I give you permission." 
               "It shall be just as you say, sir." 
               "I don't see what I shall do;" muttered Dick again, vainly trying to pull a boot on the wrong leg. 
               "You don't want them to hear it all of a sudden, I suppose." 
               "Certainly not, it would be too exciting." 
               "You want some one to break the news to them like; kind of soften it, I suppose." 
               "Well, no, not exactly that; it don't need softening, I believe. But, you know, to some very nervous temperaments, sudden joy is sometimes as dangerous as the reverse, and I know my dear mother well enough, Joseph, to be certain that she is in the greatest misery on my account, fully believing me to have perished, and in such a horrible manner; and my father and sisters must be scarcely less unhappy-and I should by no means dare to appear suddenly before them, nor even to let them hear abruptly of my safety. I don't know how I shall manage it." 
               "P'raps you had better let me go aboard in a small boat, while she is coming up, and tell 'em at first as how I am safe, and-and that you came pretty near escaping, but that a big wave came and washed you off, or summat like that now," said the sailor, anxious to assist his friend out of the dilemma. 
               Dick laughed, and said that he did not think that would do. 
               "Well, I might tell 'em as how had your body safe ashore, and that there was some hopes of your coming to." 
               "What! after ten days, Joe? That would be a pretty tough yarn." 
               "Well, well, fix it to suit yourself, then; it's all one to Granite Joe," replied the tar, a little nettled at the reception which his proposition had met with. 
               "My good friend," said Richard, laying his hand upon the shoulder of the sailor, and looking him in the face, while tears started to his own eyes, "I owe my life, under Providence, to you; I never should have lived through that most horrible night but for you; I should have gone down like lead, when the ice broke up, but for you-" 
               "Tut, tut, boy, none of that now; you would never have gone out a fishing there, but for me, if you come to that; so it is only as broad as it is long." 
               "No, no, that was my own act, and by my foolish perseverance in it I periled both our lives-yet you refused to desert me when you could have saved your own, and you were finally the means of my rescue. Do not think I can ever forget it. But I do not believe you can aid me in this matter, which requires a different kind of agent. I must see Mr. Niles." 
               "Aye, aye, sir, he is the very man to do it up right, I'm sure, but as for me, I should do nothing but blunder from beginning to end, if I undertook to tell an on-truth, I am so kind of raw, like." 
               "It is not a bad sign Joseph, when a man of your age finds it difficult to suppress the truth even for a benevolent end. It would be well if that kind of in experience were a little more common. But how to get access to Mr. Niles becomes the next question." 
               Richard pondered the subject for some time in great perplexity, his companion presuming to offer no further suggestions; and at length he resolved to send a messenger on board the vessel at the moment of her becoming moored, to request Mr. Niles' immediate presence on shore. But he had no sooner settled this point in his mind, than he remembered that that gentleman had probably no acquaintance in America, and certainly none who could be aware of his being on board the Blazer, and he feared that such a message would create discussion, and excite agitating suspicions among his friends. He resolved, therefore, to send for Mr. Popham, instructing the messenger first to inquire whether he was on board, and feeling well assured that Adonijah would not be greatly surprised at being impatiently sought after by some of his fellow citizens. The Wisconsiner would not indeed be a proper person to disclose the facts to the unhappy family, but he might be made the medium of communication with Mr. Niles, in whose tact and good sense Richard had the most unbounded confidence. 
               Young Dillon, therefore, engaged a room at a riverside inn, and, having written a note which he caused to be copied in another hand, he procured the services of a porter, who was instructed to deliver it without comment, and without answering any questions in regard to the description of person from whom he had received it. The messenger proved shrewd and capable, and succeeded in boarding the vessel some time before she came to her dock, and in finding without difficulty the object of his search, who was on deck, very busy examining the city, by means of his unfailing little telescope. Adonijah dilated a little as he read the note, and thoughts of the Mayor, and visions of a public dinner were running through his head as he replied- 
               "Yes, tell his Honor-that is to say, tell the gentleman I will come immediately, or rather I will go with you now, if I can get down into that small boat. It is very strange," he continued, rather muttering his thoughts than speaking to the man-"they must have heard something of my financial operations abroad-of course it would get into the papers; such things always do. 'Hon. Mr. Popham, agent of the Wisconsin grand-' yes, ah! I see-' has been for some time in England negotiating a loan,'-yes. What kind of a gentleman was he who gave you this note, my friend?" 
               "Well, sir, very much of a gentleman tleman, I should say-you'll see him presently, sir." 
               They were in the little boat, and were moving shoreward. 
               "Was he large and stoutish, with a gold-headed cane, or something like that, now?" 
               "Good size, sir-yes, sir-none too stout for his height, sir-didn't see the cane!" 
               "Looked dignified?" 
               "Yes, sir-oh, yes, sir." 
               "Was there more than one? Any body with him?" 
               "Yes, sir, one other-indeed there were several around." 
               "The Mayor and Common Council," thought Adonijah; "they are going to do it up nice. Really this is quite an unexpected honor," and he pondered silently the rest of the way on the speech that he should make to them, in accepting their proffered hospitalities. 
               He was landed, he was conducted to the inn, and to Richard's room, who, in order to avoid a scene, was waiting to receive him in private, and with no little anxiety in regard to the tidings he should receive of his relations. Adonijah opened the door, and Richard advanced smilingly to meet him, with his hand extended. 
               "What! hey! ho!" exclaimed Mr. Popham, staggering backwards a few steps, and turning very pale; "Mr. Dill-Dill-Dillon! Bless my soul! Is it really you, though? Are you quite cerrtaih now that you are alive?" 
               "Never more so," said Dick, following up his retreating visiter, and grasping him by the hand; "I am quite safe and sound, I assure you, and very glad to see you. Pray tell me how my friends are, and particularly my poor mother." 
               "Bad enough," said Adonijah bluntly-"Mrs. Dillon, I am sorry to say, has been almost dead, and so has Miss Elsie and your father. That man don't eat any thing, sir, and especially fish. Pray tell me how you escaped. We thought you were at Davy Jones' long ago, of course. I really am mighty glad to see you alive again, Mr. Richard, not for your sake particularly, you know, but for them poor women. I am indeed, sir," and it seemed to Dick he would never have done shaking his hand. 
               Richard answered briefly and hurriedly the tide of questions which the other poured forth in relation to the manner of his escape, promising full particulars at greater leisure. Mr. Popham acquiesced, and readily undertook to convey the good tidings privately to Mr. Niles, together with Richard's request that he should impart it to the family in such manner as he thought most discreet, and prepare them for his appearance. 
               Adonijah accordingly hastened back to the vessel, where he found the young Englishman alone on the quarter-deck, looking not a little dismal, and seeming to feel very much the want of companionship, a want which young Dillon, in the earlier part of the voyage, had so often supplied. 
               "You look sad, sir," said Adonijah, grinning broadly as he approached him. 
               "I feel so," replied Melancthon; "there is a dreadful weight on my spirits, and if I were not so used to something of the sort, I should say it was all on account of young Dillon, and this wretched family, for they seem to feel their loss more keenly as they approach port, and are about to land in their new home." 
               "I dare say," replied Popham laughing, "it's very hard, aint it?" 
               "It is certainly a most melancholy affair." 
               "To be starved and frozen stiff on the ice, and afterwards to be eaten up by fishes." 
               "Dreadful! dreadful!" 
               "Part of him inside of one shark, and part in another, and perhaps before he was quite dead, too!" 
               "Pray don't," exclaimed Niles, "these are harrowing thoughts. Do you know I had begun to entertain a strong friendship for that young man, without being quite conscious of it myself until he was lost. He was always so amiable, and so exceedingly cheerful, his merriment was really contagious. I know you do not mean to be unkind, and you are of course delighted to get back to your native land; but pray do not speak lightly of him and his fearful fate." 
               "I can't help it," replied Adonijah, "there is something so kind of odd about it all; though I liked young Dick, too, for that matter, and meant to have had him for a neighbor out in Wisconsin, if he had lived. Aint you sorry though?" 
               "So much so, that I seem to nave lost a brother; but let us drop the subject. It is too painful to dwell upon, and the past cannot be recalled." 
               "Can't it though? I'm not so sure of that. Wait a minute. Do you see that brown-stone hotel, near the river here, with the stars and stripes and the American eagle a floating from the cupola? Do you see it?" 
               "Yes." 
               "Well, do you see the second-story corner room this way, with one window raised?" 
               "Yes, what of it?" said Melancthon, wearily. 
               "And somebody sittin' near it?" 
               "I believe so, but I can scarcely tell at this distance; why do you ask?" 
               "That there man is Richard Dillon!-alive and well as you or I. Here, take my glass, and look at him." 
               Niles stared silently a moment at the other with a bewildered air, and gleaning something from the expression of his face which gave force to his words, he snatched the glass, and turned it hastily toward the indicated spot. At the next instant, the little telescope was flying seaward through the air, and Melancthon, with a bound, rushed upon the Yankee, and threw his arms around him in a transport of joy. 
               "It's true! it's true!" he exclaimed. "He is alive, after all! and you have seen him and conversed with him? It was he who sent for you to come ashore? Is this so? Speak quickly, for Heaven's sake." 
               "All right, that's exactly it," replied Popham, who next quickly ly related to his eager listener all that he himself knew of the mode of Dillon's escape, and also communicated to him the message which the young man had sent. 
               Mr. Niles now hastened to recover his equanimity of mind, that he might fulfil the pleasant yet delicate task assigned to him, and composing his features into a less mirthful expression, he descended into the cabin, where Mr. Dillon and his family were making preparations for debarkation. 
               "We are getting ready to land," said the Squire, "but it's sad work, Mr. Niles; I have no heart to do any thing now. I thought I knew what trouble was before, but it was all imagination-all about a little pelf that we could easily have gained in this new country, or as easily have dispensed with, if he was only here. And look at them!" 
               He pointed to his wife, who had desisted from packing some things in a box, as he spoke, and had seated herself on a lounge, weeping bitterly, while Elsie, with red and swollen eyes, was vainly trying to comfort her. The time was unfavorable for disclosure, if he would avoid violent revulsions of feeling, but delay was impossible, as on shore they would be liable at any moment to hear the intelligence in the most abrupt manner. 
               "Do not give way to this despair, my dear sir," said Niles, "for there is certainly a possibility of your son having escaped, although, of course, have but little reason to hope so." 
               "Not any-not any; it would only increase and prolong my anguish, if I gave way to such illusions; I would only become a madman, like the poor fisherman, Renny, who went night and morning regularly for seventeen years, to the beach, to look for the returning boat of his lost son. He thought there was a possibility, but there was none. I want no such hopes." 
               The Squire did not notice what struck the quicker perception of his wife and daughter that their friend held out this encouragement to them now for the first time since their bereavement. His words before had been those of solace, but not of hope. 
               "There is a rumor," continued Niles, "that some men were rescued at sea under perilous circumstances, and have been brought into port by a vessel that has just arrived. It is possible-" 
               The conviction passed, swiftly as electricity, to Elsie's mind, that Niles would never dazzle them with such a hope, while there was a possibility that it might be extinguished, and thoughtless of consequences, she sprang to his side and caught hold of his arm- 
               "You have heard more!" she said; "speak! He is alive!-alive! alive!. You have heard it, I know! I see it in your eyes! Oh, speak, for the love of heaven, and say it is true!" 
               The mother was already in a swoon-the father, white and trembling, moved lips that gave no utterance-and Elsie again besought in tones of anguish, a single word confirmatory of her hopes. 
                
               "There is certainly very great reason to believe that Richard is safe," said Melancthon, taking a hand of both father and daughter. 
               Be calm, dear girl; look first to your mother, who needs your assistance, and you shall in a few minutes know all that I can tell you." 
               Mrs. Dillon was speedily restored to consciousness, and supported by assistants, who stood nearly as much in need of aid as herself, she cast an imploririg glance at Niles, seeming to ask, and yet to be afraid to hear what more he had to tell. 
               "You may well imagine," he said that I would not hold out this great hope to you, if I had not very weighty reasons for believing it will be realized. It is certain that two men have been rescued from the ice at sea within a short time, and have been brought into this port. It is certain that one of them was a young gentleman and the other an old sailor. Nay," he continued, as he saw the truth could no longer be concealed, and might safely be spoken, "do not fear to hope the best? Your son is alive! I have seen him!" 
               It would be in vain to marshal words and sentences to describe the scene of joy, the tumult of happy emotions, the ejaculations of praise to heaven, the tender congratulations of husband with wife, parent with child, sisters with brother, which followed these words. All was commotion for a few minutes, and while this scene of family endearments was progressing, Melancthon left them unobserved, and went upon deck, whence he despatched a messenger for Richard, with permission to him to come as speedily as he chose to his friends. How he bounded to the boat, and bribed the tugging oarsmen to superhuman exertions, for the purpose of gaining an extra half minute, which would have seemed to him an hour-how he stood up as he neared the ship, and waved his hat to his friends, who were all assembled on deck-how the whole ship's crew gave three times three hilarious cheers, led off by Melancthon and the Stentorian Popham, while the crews of twenty other vessels in the harbor looked on in surprise, many of them joining at a venture in the hurrahs, under the impression that some very illustrious man was visiting the Blazer-how Dick was fairly dragged over the ship's sides, and encircled and hugged all at once by a family of eleven, and pulled by the arms, and by the hands, and by the legs, and climbed upon, and shouted at-how all these things took place, it is necessary only to hint at, not to tell. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIII. 
               THE week that next ensued, after the arrival of the Immigrant family in New York, was one of too much excitement and joy, resulting from their unexpected reunion, to admit of any other topic either of business or pleasure being discussed. With the restoration of his son, Mr. Dillon felt that every thing had been restored to him, and he believed that he could in future cheerfully bear, not only all the reverses of fortune which he had already experienced, but all which might yet be in store for him. A similar spirit animated the rest of the family, and they all looked cheerfully forward to their future in the new world, over which although a cloud of uncertainty hung, it was still a cloud spanned by the bright rainbow of Hope. The charm of daily novelty and adventure, with which their new life was invested, had its influence upon all, and especially upon Richard, who would not nave exchanged it for all the comforts and ease of his former home. 
               For a few days they had seen Mr. Niles quite frequently, who continued to manifest much kindness to all the family, though more especially to Richard and Elsie; but as other engagements began to occupy his attention, they saw him much more Seldom, and now looked forward with real regret to the apparently final separation from him, which their removal westward would occasion. 
               For that removal they began to make active preparations, and the first business incumbent on Mr. Dillon was, of course, to procure the money on his foreign bills, in which consisted the bulk of his available means. 
               'Six hundred pounds, Dick. There it is, in two bills of exchange on the best house in New York. That will be something to start us in this new country, at least. There are said to be places here where a third of this sum will support a large family comfortably for a year." 
               This remark was addressed by the elder Dillon to his son, one morning about a week after their arrival in New York, while discussing at their hotel their future movements. That Mr. Dillon had been able to bring with him so large a sum of money, notwithstanding his embarrassments, had been owing partly to the kindness of the solicitor Bray, who had advanced several quarters' income of the estate, while a considerable amount had been realized from a sale of his family furniture. It seemed quite a fortune to Daniel, who had not for many years been the possessor of so large a sum; but he resolved to use it economically, for he knew that it must be nearly a year before he could expect to receive any thing more from England, and that his remittance then would be less than a hundred pounds. 
               "Six hundred!" replied Dick, laughing; "why you are a Crsus, father; and then I have fifteen pounds in pocket besides, one of which is to be transmuted into Opera tickets to-night, I suppose, as the girls are all determined to see something of New York life." 
               "They ought certainly to see all they can during our very brief stay, for we shall leave the city probably in three days; and I fear there will be but few enjoyments for the poor dears where we are going. But my first business may as well be to procure my funds; so, if you will hand me my portfolio, I will endorse these bills, and then go after the money." 
               Richard did as he was required, and the 'Squire carefully wrote his name upon the drafts, and taking from his trunk a letter of introduction to the bankers on whom the bills were drawn, he sallied forth, leaving Richard in company with his sisters, who at the same time entered the room. 
               Daniel knew but little of New York, either geographically or morally, but he had the necessary address written upon a paper which he carried in his hand, and consulted very frequently as he went along; and as he also closely examined the street names at every corner, and stopped a great many very fast-going people to ask his way, he progressed very slowly, and attracted probably more observation than he imagined. But he had set out early, and slow though he was, he reached the office before business hours, and found it unopened, a fact which he did not make himself quite certain of until after a great deal of fumbling at the handle of the door, and frequent applications of his fat red face to the cold window-plates, through which he plainly saw a bright coal-fire in the grate, and a general air of neatness and tidiness within. He was observing enough, also, to notice that the premises had a substantial, specie-basis sort of aspect, and he felt no misgiving about his paper being promptly honored as soon as either member of the firm arrived. 
               Ignorant of Wall street hours, and wondering that business men should be so late, he cast a glance at the slow-moving hands of old Trinity, and was about to turn away, with the intention of returning at ten o'clock, when a well-dressed, dapper-looking man brushed past him, apparently without noticing him, and taking hold of the door-knob, gave a vigorous push, as if he expected to enter quite as a matter of course. 
               "My clerks are very late this morning," he said, politely, turning to Daniel; "were you wanting to do any business with the house? I am extremely sorry to keep you waiting." 
               "Oh, it is of no consequence," replied Mr. Dillon, taking from an outer pocket his letter of introduction; "yes, I have a little business here. You are one of the gentlemen to whom this letter is addressed, I presume." 
               "Certainly," replied the other, quickly breaking the seal; and while he was reading the contents, Daniel noticed, as a very singular coincidence, that this was one of the same fast-going gentlemen of whom he had inquired his way a short time before, and who was then going in an opposite direction from his own. After perusing the letter, he gave Mr. Dillon a cordial shake of the hand, much to that gentleman's satisfaction, and expressed himself highly delighted to make his acquaintance. 
               "I am Mr. Blythe," he continued, "of the firm of Blythe, Bell & Co. Our correspondents speak of some drafts upon us which you hold. Have you them with you?" 
               "Yes, sir, here they are," replied Daniel, handing the papers, which his companion took in a hurried and nervous manner and eagerly examined, and his eye lighted up with pleasure quite disproportionate to the seeming cause, when he saw that the bills were both regularly endorsed by Mr. Dillon. 
               "All right," said the banker; "our correspondents have also taken the precaution to send your signature in their letter, to save any trouble in identifying you." 
               "Yes, they said it might save trouble if I wrote my name in their letter. It's all right, is it?" 
               "Perfectly, perfectly; the signatures correspond to a hair," replied the other, putting the bills in his pocket, and looking quickly up and down the street, probably for his clerks; "not that I should have suspected any thing, had it been otherwise; but pray, do not let me detain you here in the street. Mr. Bell shall bring the money to you at your hotel in half an hour. Good morning, my dear sir, I am very happy to have met you. Pray come and dine with me at six this evening, at No. 12 Pensacola Place-or to-morrow evening-or next day, whenever it suits your convenience; do come, now-good morning, good morning." 
               Mr. Blythe rattled all this off with inconceivable rapidity, shaking Daniel warmly by the hand all the while, and fairly forcing him on to the sidewalk, and turning him around in the direction of Broadway. 
               But Mr. Dillon did not go. He said he could not think of such a thing as troubling his friend to send the money so far, and that he could just as well wait as not, as he had nothing else in the world to do. Besides, although Daniel entertained not the slightest mistrust of his companion, he had a sort of vague idea that it was better to go with the money in his hand. 
               Meanwhile the nervous, eager air of the business man increased very much. 
               "Well, well," he replied, "just as you say, my dear sir, of course; just as you say. But, pray, don't let us stand here in the cold. Let us take a turn about the street, and look at some of the fine buildings, and we will return here in half an hour, when the office will be sure to be open." 
               So saying, the affable gentleman drew Mr. Dillon's arm within his own, and walked with him down Wall street, pointing out to him, as they went along, the various objects of interest in that highway of Mammon, and expatiating with much eloquence upon all of them. They stopped in front of the Exchange, that massive pile of granite, which then wore a majestic and imposing air, essentially, different from the cowed and humbled aspect it has assumed since it was brought under the hammer and publicly sold in its own rotunda. 
               "Is it not a stupendous and beautiful building?" said Mr. Dillon's lon's friend; "would you not like to see the interior of it? Of course you would. Then come with me; I think I can procure admittance, although this is not the hour." 
               So saying, he conducted his companion through Hanover street to Exchange Place, and stopping in front of one of the dozen entrances and exits of the building, requested him to remain there a few minutes, while he, Mr. Blythe, should step up stairs to the agent's office, and procure tickets for their admission to the interior of the building. 
               Daniel complied, but not without a rather painful sense of the weight of his obligations to his new friend, and he spent many minutes in considering how he could requite so much kindness, before it occurred to him that the banker had been absent remarkably long, considering the nature of his errand. He waited another five minutes, looking frequently up the steps for the returning figure of his friend, and thinking that a great deal of importunity must have been required to procure the tickets of admission. Finally he proceeded up the stairs, and after much difficulty he found the agent's office; but, to his great surprise, he did not find his friend there, and to his still greater astonishment he learned that no such person had been there, and that no tickets were required or were ever issued for admission to the Exchange. 
               A faint but terrible suspicion took shape in Daniel's mind. 
               "But he is here somewhere," he said, taking courage, "he came up these stairs, and has not descended. Is there any other entrance to the building?" 
               "More than a dozen," replied the agent, laughing; "the building fronts on four streets, and has four entrances on each street. It is a public thoroughfare, passed through by hundreds at all hours of the day. What is the matter?" he continued, as he saw Mr. Dillon turn exceedingly pale, "has any body been thimblerigging you?" 
               Daniel could not reply, but hurrying away, he retraced his steps as rapidly as his agitation, and his imperfect knowledge of the localities would admit, to the banking office where he had met his accommodating companion. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIV. 
               MESSRS. Blythe, Bell & Co., bankers and stockbrokers, were one of the wealthiest and most respectable houses in a street which boasts not a few similar firms. Its senior member was a gentleman of about fifty-five years of age, of polished manners and great amiability of character, while Mr. Bell, the more active partner, was a much younger man, with very piercing eyes, and a clear ringing voice, which suited his name, and seemed in some way a natural consequence of it. He was a bustling, busy fellow, too talkative and too full of orders to the clerks, to quite suit his senior's idea of a business man, but then in the presence of Mr. Blythe, these excesses always moderated, and the clapper of Mr. Bell gradually abated its motion and its noise, and subsided into a very gentle tinkling. He was a very shrewd person, however, of extraordinarily quick perception, and therefore he exactly suited his partner, who himself did all the reflecting and reasoning for the whole firm. "Co." number one was a silent, elderly man, of nearly Mr. Blythe's own age, who might have been chained to his desk five hours each day, without the least inconvenience to himself, and probably without his knowledge, so seldom did he quit it; and "Co." number two was a grave, steady young gentleman until three o'clock every afternoon, and a merry, jovial fellow for the rest of the day, abounding in jokes, cigars, and opera tickets, and being moreover very popular "in the street." Four or five clerks, each aspiring to be a "Co." at some future time, completed the establishment, and formed a very lively and appreciating afternoon audience for the bon mots and witticisms of the junior partner, whose place was soon to be filled from their number, because he was to be sent off, either to the Buffalo, or Cincinnati, or Chicago branch of the house. 
               Mr. Bell had not been five minutes at his counter that morning, before a well-dressed man of about forty years of age, of most graceful and easy address, and slightly aspirating his "h's," presented him with a letter liberally sealed with wax, and politely requested his immediate attention to it, stating that he had some pressing business in a distant part of the city. The banker broke the seal, glanced hastily at the contents, and then extended his hand cordially to the stranger. 
               "Happy to see you, Mr. Dillon," he said; "Mr. Blythe, this is Mr. Daniel Dillon, an English gentleman, who brings us a letter from Cathcart & Sons; happy to see you, sir-walk inside, sir; Smith, a chair for Mr. Dillon." 
               Bell handed the letter to Mr. Blythe as he spoke, and the latter with equal politeness welcomed the bearer, who seemed somewhat embarrassed by the profusion of courtesies bestowed upon him. 
               "Hi beg your pardon, gentlemen," he said, rapidly, "and with your permission, Hi shall do myself the honor to call and see you again very soon-say this afternoon, or to-morrow. Just now I 'appen to be in great 'aste. Will you be kind enough to look at these bills?" 
               The letters spoke of them, and the partners were prepared to see the two drafts for three hundred pounds sterling each, which were placed in their hands. The endorsements upon them corresponded accurately, as has been said, to the test signature which had been enclosed in the letter. 
               "Certainly, yes sir, all right, Edwards, a check for Mr. Dillon-six hundred pounds," said Mr. Blythe, handing the bills to "Co." number one. 
               "Be kind enough to make it payable to your own order, as they will not know me at the Bank," suggested the stranger. 
               "Certainly," said Mr. Blythe, and a moment afterwards he received the check from the hands of the precisian at the desk, endorsed it with the name of the firm, and handed it to his anxious customer, who took it quickly, and making very brief adieux, departed. 
               Mr. Blythe withdrew into the back room and took up the morning paper, but Bell remained gazing after the stranger a few seconds, with flashing eyes, and a peculiar expression of countenance. Then beckoning with his pen to a clerk, he whispered something to him, and the latter at once took his hat and left the office. 
               For fifteen minutes the business of the house went on in its usual routine, and then the door violently opened, and Mr. Daniel Dillon rushed in with a very blazing face, breathing hard, and stood a moment staring wildly around him, without speaking. 
               "What's wanting, sir?" exclaimed the glib Mr. Bell, whose tongue went off apparently of its own accord, whenever any thing unusual occurred. 
               "Is Mr. Blythe here?" asked Daniel, very loudly. 
               Mr. Blythe heard the question, and came in from the back room, paper in hand. 
               "Are you Mr. Blythe, of this firm?" said Daniel quickly, and trembling from head to foot. 
               "I am sir," was the answer, in a mild voice. 
               "Are you sure?" asked Daniel, with great earnestness and scarcely knowing what he said. 
               "Quite certain," replied the banker, smiling, and then exchanging a wondering glance with Mr. Bell, who seemed a little uneasy. 
               "Then I have been robbed!" he exclaimed; "robbed by a villain who took your name-but, thank Heaven, I am in time to prevent loss." 
               Bell sprang over the counter, and catching Mr. Dillon by the arm, exclaimed- 
               "Is your name-" 
               "Dillon! Daniel Dillon!" said the other. 
               "I knew it! I knew it!" he said. "Quick Charley! George! after him. Edwards, to the bank! Wilson, run for a police officer! He has not been gone ten minutes, and Mr. Lee has been out watching his movements ever since he left the office. I suspected him Mr. Blythe, from the very way he grasped the check, and crumplpd it into his vest pocket, I did, indeed, sir." 
               "The check! the check!" cried Daniel, perfectly aghast; "you haven't really paid him my money?" 
               "Yes, but we have though; three thousand dollars, at this desk, and there is our warrant for it in your endorsement. The loss is yours sir, unless we can catch him." 
               Daniel groaned, and started in pursuit, exclaiming that he should know him among ten thousand, but at the doorway he met young Lee, who had been sent out by Mr. Bell immediately after the swindler's departure. He reported that he had followed him to the bank, and had seen him receive the money, but not without a delay of some minutes, owing to there being several in advance of him at the paying-teller's desk. He had then followed him to Broadway, and had seen him get into a stage which was going up. town, and he had taken accurate notice of the line, the color and number, as well as well as the drivers' dress, all of which, speaking in panting haste, he named to his anxious listeners. 
               "Bravo, my boy, now then we'll have him," said Bell, "and here comes Wilson with an officer, just in time. This way, gentlemen!" 
               And Mr. Bell ran up Wall street, followed by the "Star" and the two clerks, and preceded by the puffing Mr. Dillon, who having learned the direction, quite distanced his competitors, overturning two newsboys and an apple-stand at the corner of the Custom-house, and seriously frightening an express team a little further on, so that they were with difficulty held in. 
               "A shrewd fellow is Bell!" said the stiff Mr. Edwards, returning to his desk, and beckoning the remaining clerks back to their business. 
               "He is, indeed. I hope for Mr. Dillon's sake, he may succeed," replied Mr. Blythe, reseating himself, and composedly resuming his newspaper. 
               The pursuers, in the meantime, reached Broadway, hailed a stage, poured pell-mell into it, greatly to the alarm of a fat old lady, who occupied one corner of the vehicle, and who was the only other passenger in it. 
               "We take all the seats, driver," shouted Bell through the money-hole, "and here is ten dollars for yourself if you overtake No. 226 of -- Line, before it reaches 14th street. Stop for nothing now, but go it like a locomotive; we are after a 'fast man.'" 
               "Aye, aye," responded the Jehu, and, laying the lash upon the horses, they started off up Broadway at a rate that never stage had gone before, while hundreds of people turned to look at the strange spectacle of an unfilled omnibus travelling rapidly, and to wonder at the singular driver, who did not make every obstacle in the crowded street an excuse for either letting his horses walk or for coming to a full pause. 
               Onward they went, grazing a hundred wheels, tossing up the hind ends of countless carts downward bound, now jolting over causeways, and now plashing through mud holes, and plastering with their scattered contents the incautious pedestrians, who stood watching upon the curbstone for a chance to cross. In vain were innumerable fingers held up to solicit seats in such an unusual express, and in vain did the fat lady tug at the check-string and demand to be let out at the corner of Chambers. Mr. Dillon begged her to be quiet, assuring her that she should be brought safely back, and pointing to the "Star" officer with a mysterious air, which quite frightened her into silence. 
               Messrs. Bell and Lee were stationed one at each of the forward windows, keeping a vigilant look-out in front, with the hope of discovering the stage they were in pursuit of; but they saw only a long uniform row of omnibus roofs stretching away in the distance, over which it seemed that one might have walked for miles. 
               "What kind of hat had the driver?" shouted Jehu, twisting himself curiously around toward the money-hole, but without abating his speed. 
               "A cloth cap," answered Lee, eagerly, "with a long leather what-d'ye-call it in front." 
               "Aye, aye, there's lots of them. Was there any thing on top?" he said, sending his hoarse voice, with a very strange reverberation, through the hole. 
               "On top of what? Of the hat?" asked Lee, quite at a loss. 
               "He means on top of the stage," answered three or four Voices inside, including that of the fat lady, who had now become greatly interested in the chase. 
               "Oh, aye, yes; there was a band-box. I remember distinctly seeing it bob up and down." 
               "Ah, there's lots of them, too," growled the driver cracking his whip, and faster still they rattled on. Five minutes ensued, and then the voice from the box reported a band-box and a cloth cap about ten blocks ahead, an announcement which caused the liveliest excitement inside. A few more minutes sufficed to discover that both the color of the stage and the line to which it belonged answered to the description given by Mr. Lee of the vehicle which the swindler had entered. No exertion was now spared. The bribe to the driver was doubled, and the horses were put into an unbroken gallop, while every thing else which had wheels was seen diverging towards the sidewalks, and making a wide path for the team that was supposed to be running away. 
               Three blocks distant, and the driver announced the number- 
               "Two hundred and twenty-six." 
               "That's it," said Bell; "go it now, we'll have him." 
               Another square was gained, and another, and now the panting steeds of the pursuers were blowing their hot breath into the very window of 226, when the latter vehicle sheered aside, and the stages were running parallel to each other. 
               Before the galloping horses could be checked, the gentlemen rushed out, the "Star" held up his hand with an authoritative sign, and the pursued driver, pale with the apprehension that he must have violated some new and unknown ordinance, or that he had run over an alderman's child, drew up his team with a jerk, and tremblingly awaited orders. Daniel darted to the door, and leaping upon the steps, collared a very astonished-looking gentleman, and dragged him nearly out of the stage before he discovered he was not the delinquent. Then, dropping his captive quite unceremoniously, he turned to seek the swindler among the remaining passengers, but inexpressibly severe was his disappointment to find no one who bore the remotest resemblance to the pretended Mr. Blythe. 
               The captured gentleman proved to be a man of sense, and was easily appeased by an explanation from Mr. Bell, and an apology by Daniel, whom he proceeded to inform that an individual, answering exactly to his description of the swindler, had left the stage near the City Hall. 
               "He made some inquiry about the Harlem cars," added the gentleman, adjusting his crumpled coat-collar, "and undoubtedly he will be in the woods of Westchester county in half an hour. There is not one chance in a thousand of your catching him, you may depend on that. Go on, driver." 
               The pursuers, although greatly discouraged, did not abandon the chase. Mr. Dillon and the officer crossed to the track of the Harlem Railroad, and took the first cars in pursuit, while Messrs. Bell and Lee returned down town to lay a complaint before the Chief of the Police, and to send on an additional force. Advertisements in various shapes were also speedily issued, offering large rewards for the recovery of the money, but all proved in vain. The Chief, indeed, assured Daniel, not at all to his satisfaction, that he knew the rogue very well, by the description given of him, and that he was one of the most accomplished villains extant. 
               "He is a foreigner, of course," he added; "for our most expert rogues all are so, but this fellow, I am sorry to say, is one of your own countrymen." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XV. 
               ALTHOUGH, after his severe loss, Mr. Dillon had returned to his family a sad and much dejected man, yet his misfortune, in the shadow of that greater affliction which he had so recently escaped, did not appear to him so ruinous and, overwhelming as it would otherwise have seemed. He had not lost his son. Richard was spared to him, and, together, they could yet brave adversity with a fortitude which, under his supposed bereavement, had entirely departed from him. 
               When several days had elapsed, and all search for the lost money was abandoned as futile, a family council was held in relation to their movements in this new and unforeseen exigency. The result of this conference was a resolution to continue their journey at some rate, and by no means to return to England. Their loss was to be made up by privations and labor; it was to be met indeed in any way excepting by the prostration of despair. The 'whole family were animated with this feeling, and consented to undergo every self-denial necessary to carry out their plans. Their horses and hounds, beloved like relations, were to be sold-their watches, of which they had four in the family, were also to be parted with-and some jewelry of Clara and Elsie were freely offered to swell the amount of their funds. 
               Some bitter tears fell as these selections were successively made, but Richard's heart was the heaviest, for his loss was the greatest, and nearly irreparable. He did not complain, but there was an unusual number of his "howevers" in his remarks, seeming to indicate that he was constantly catching sight of some new hope which was to set every thing right. 
               "Now, my boy," said his father, "as every thing is agreed upon, the sooner it is done the better, for our daily expenses here are large. It must be an auction, I suppose." 
               "Yes," said Dick, "an auction; Brutus and Cassius, Flash and Dash," and he turned away his face and looked out of the window, at the crowd passing in the street. But he turned back after a few seconds, and said, "However!" 
               "Four gold watches," said his father, continuing the enumeration; "two diamond rings, earrings, bracelets, gold buckles, &c., &c. You had better at once make the necessary arrangements." 
               "Wait a moment," replied Richard,' "I have a new plan. Let us borrow money enough on this property to pay our travelling expenses, and retain the privilege of redeeming every thing." 
               "Of whom?" 
               "Why, of whom should it be but our capital old friend Popham, who will keep every thing safe and snug for us until we call for them." 
               The idea was voted a good one; Adonijah was yet in the city, and they saw him frequently, but he had not yet heard of their loss. He was accordingly sent for, and after being informed of their calamity, for which he expressed the most unbounded sympathy, Richard's plan was proposed. The Wisconsinner held up both hands in surprise. It was impossible. He would be delighted to do it, but had not command of sufficient funds. Besides, he said, the horses could not be taken to the far west without great risk and cost. Richard said that himself and a young brother would themselves ride the animals, and of course take the greatest care of them, and that Mr. Popham should at once have a bill of sale of them, and should have them delivered at his own door free of cost. 
               "Very sorry," said Adonijah, shaking his head slowly from side to side; "ver-y sor-ry! but I really can't do it-circumstances won't permit-else I would gladly." 
               It was not in the nature of the Dillons to urge an application like this, although the security was far greater in value than the sum they asked, and Popham was allowed to depart without further solicitation. 
               "What next?" said Daniel. 
               "The hammer!" answered Dick, cheerily, "going-going-gone!" and he went out to inquire for a suitable auctioneer. 
               As Mr. Popham was returning to his own hotel, he met Mr. Niles, and informed him of the serious loss which their fellow passengers had sustained, and also of the application which had been made to him for a loan- 
               "Which, of course, you know, I could not do, for strangers like them. It would be altogether unbusiness-like. Besides that, what on earth should I do with a set of old dogs and hunting-horses on my hands?" 
               "True enough-of course-yes-what, indeed!" were the somewhat wandering answers that Melancthon gave to these remarks, with an absent and thoughtful air; but he entered Popham's hotel with him, and went to his room and conversed a long while with him there. 
               Richard meanwhile went on his errand. He had fortunately been recommended to an auctioneer who was reliable and honest, but whose frank statement of the probable proceeds of the sale, and of the expenses attending it, were any thing but encouraging. He left orders for the necessary advertisements, and went home thoroughly disheartened. 
               "It's a sad prospect, certainly," said the senior Mr. Dillon, when Richard had told his story. 
               "Yes," said Dick, "sad enough. However." 
               Mr. Dillon employed the evening in writing to his agent Bray, informing him of their loss, and urging him by some means, instantly to forward to him, another quarter's rent in advance, in order that they might at least have something on which to depend in their new home, for procuring present shelter and subsistence. A night of great dejection ensued to all. The hopes which their morning energy had created grew fainter by contemplation in more quiet hours, and sad forebodings of coming destitution filled every heart. 
               In the morning they received a visit from Captain Stone, who listened with great concern to the story of their misfortune, and immediately took out his pocket-book. 
               "You paid me a great deal; rather too much, I guess, considering for we came very slow, and part of you I only brought half way, you know," he said, laughing, and looking at Dick. "Take this," he continued, offering fifty dollars, "you might easily have beaten me down more than this, on the price of the passage, if you had known how." 
               It was impossible to be offended at the sailor's offer, but the gentlemen politely declined it with many sincere thanks. 
               Nathan urged his gift for some time, but, finding it unavailable, he put up his money, and after many minute inquiries in regard to the particulars of their loss, he departed with the significant remark- 
               "Mebbe you'll see me agin-mebbe not-but you don't know the Yankees yet, you don't, I see that." 
               In the course of the same day, they had another and quite unexpected visit from Mr. Popham, who displayed a decided increase, of importance in his air, and had not at all the appearance of a man who had so lately refused assistance to the family he now called upon. 
               "How comes on the auction?" he asked. 
               "It is to take place to-morrow," replied the elder Mr. Dillon; "but I fear it will not avail us much." 
               "What was the sum you required yesterday?" 
               "A hundred pounds. We have a trifle in pocket, and thought we could get along with that sum until we receive a remittance from home. We shall travel cheaply, and when we get to the Far West we shall live cheaply, also, until better times." 
               "Well, I have thought better of your proposition. I always like to assist a fellow being when he gets into trouble; in fact, it's a wonderful pleasure for me to do so. I will lend you the money, and I think you had better take a thousand dollars, so as to be sure and have enough. There is my check for a thousand; never mind about the security-we'll arrange all that when we get out there." 
               Astonished and delighted, the Dillons knew not how to express their sense of their friend's kindness. In, vain did they urge upon him the golden pledges, which would have secured at least a portion of the loan. He declined every thing with the air of a monarch, and repeated that they would settle every thing of that kind in their western home. 
               "I shall be there first, you know, and when you reach the Territory, you must inquire at once for Pophamville, and you'll soon find me out. Perhaps I may meet you at Milwaukie where you will land, and possibly I may have a farm selected for you that will suit you. You will want a largish house, won't you?" 
               "What do you mean?" said Daniel. "Pray make no engagements for us that we are not able to fulfill. We shall, of course, have to take a small farm and a small house also, and live at the cheapest possible rate, until my remittances from England begin, and until this heavy debt is paid." 
               "Don't worry yourself about the debt; there won't be any haste about that; I like to aid a worthy man, I do, sir. Good-bye, give me your hand, sir; we shall meet soon in Wisconsin, and I hope to make a good Yankee of you yet." 
               "It is a title that I should have reason to be very proud of, "replied Dillon, whose English prejudices were rapidly dissolving beneath the singular kindness of Adonijah, and the remembered generosity of Capt. Stone. 
               "Extraordinary people these Americans are," he said to his son, when the visiter had departed. "No sooner do they hear of my loss, than one whisks out his pocket-book, and thrusts a fifty-dollar note toward me, and another, with larger means, throws a thousand dollars at my feet, without other security than my word. How long might I have waited at home for similar kindnesses in the hour of trouble!" 
               While he spoke, a servant showed in Capt. Nathan Stone, whose rapid step, flushed face, and very disordered hair, betokened considerable excitement but not apparently of an unpleasant nature. 
               "I said mebbe you'd see me agin, and mebbe not, didn't I?" he asked, abruptly, "and I said you did not know the Yankees Yet, didn't I?" 
               "You did," replied Mr. Dillon, Shaking hands with the sailor. 
               "Well, sir, I took the liberty of doing a few chores for you to-day, seein' as how you warn't quite up to snuff in this 'ere country." 
               "What do you mean?" 
               "I went and wrote this 'ere little paper, settin' forth your misfortins, and saying as how you had landed as a stranger on our hospitable shores, and had been robbed of every farthing almost the moment you had set foot on land, and how you had a family of ten, and were going to the far west, and all that." 
               "But, Mr. Stone, I-" 
               "I did not exactly write it all myself; I have a lawyer cousin here who put it into shape, and into pretty good penmanship, though I used to write a better hand than he can when I taught school in Weathersfield, but that is a long time ago now." 
               "But, Captain Stone, you-" 
               "Then I tuk it to your brokerman, and he put his firm name right plump down for a hundred dollars, and said, said he, as he rattled the sand over his signature, 'I did not know as he would take it, or I would have offered it before'. Then I put out owners down for seventy-five, which they had agreed to; then I carried it round to about twenty offices which Mr. Blythe gave me the names and numbers of on a slip of paper, and in two hours and twenty-five minutes, by the watch, sir, I had eight hundred and fifty dollars subscribed and collected, and in my pocket, and here it is, sir, all in city money." 
               Tears started to Mr. Dillon's eyes as he listened to the recital of these generous acts, and for some seconds strong emotion prevented the utterance of his thanks. When he found words, it was to heap epithets of kindness upon Nathan, upon the subscribers to his paper, and upon the whole Yankee nation. 
               "But I can't take it, you know," he said, "it is impossible; I am not an object of charity, and we will not receive alms, will we, Dick?" 
               "Most assuredly we can do no such thing," replied Richard. 
               Nathan looked blank and puzzled. 
               "You don't mean to say you are going to refuse the money?" he said. 
               "I do not see what else we can do." 
               "Bless you, sir, do any thing but that. Why, sir, the men who gave it won't feel it more than so many mosquito bites." 
               "If they feel it as much as eight hundred and fifty mosquito bites, they will retain no very pleasant remembrance of us," said Dick. 
               "Don't think of such a thing," continued Nathan, earnestly; "they've charged it all to profit and loss before this, and have forgotten all about it." 
                
               "But our honor requires-" 
               "I do not think, papa," interrupted Elsie, "that honor requires you to wound the feelings of these generous strangers, by returning their donation, nor to deprive yourself of such a timely aid. Do unbend a little of your island dignity, papa and Dicky both, I pray. Accept the money, if not as a gift, yet as a loan. Take it with thanks, and in the spirit in which it is offered, and if you wish to return it hereafter, you can always do so through your friend, Mr. Blythe." 
               "Spoken like an oracle," said Richard; "I see that we shall safely double this stormy cape of honor under Elsie's pilotage, and hold on to the money-bags, besides." 
               "Dicky, don't now," began Elsie. 
               "No, no, I am in earnest; Elsie is right. We can publish a card of thanks and explanations in one of the papers, pledging ourselves to return the money, and allowing a present opportunity for any one to recall his contribution, who may have given under a mistaken idea of our destitution." 
               "Or of our being objects of charity, as papa says." 
               "Yes, and then we can do something towards an object which I am sure you all have deeply at heart, as well as myself, and that is the welfare of Granite Joe." 
               This proposition was responded to by acclamation, and the money was accepted, as greatly to the delight of Nathan as if he had been the principal benefieiary, instead of being one of the donors. After cordially shaking hands with all the family, he went away, reiterating the proposition with which he had entered, "I told you you did not know the Yankees yet." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVI. 
               IT was but the third day after Mr. Dillon's misfortune, that he found himself thus, by the kindness of strangers, almost entirely relieved from its evil effects, and his heart grew light and happy again in the contemplation of a prosperous future. He had not seen Mr. Niles within several days, but he was neither surprised nor offended that a mere travelling acquaintance, of rank and wealth evidently superior to his own, should see fit to lessen the intimacy between them, which had owed its origin mainly to the necessity of companionship during a sea voyage. He knew, too, that Mr. Niles had brought letters of introduction to several of the most distinguished families in the American metropolis, and he was aware what large claims society makes upon the time of a fashionable man, especially if he is somewhat of a lion. He nevertheless expected to see his fellow-countryman. again before leaving the city, nor was he disappointed. Mr. Niles came, with explanations that fully exonerated him from the charge of neglect, and received and extended a cordial greeting to the whole family. To Elsie his kindness was marked and peculiar, yet distinct from the tenderness of a lover. He had retained her sketch of the ice-bound ship, and now, to her undisguised delight, he brought many copies of it beautifully and faithfully engraved, for her acceptance. The compliment was appreciated and acknowledged, and Elsie, frank and sincere, never dreamed of saying that it was a very imperfect sketch, or that she was quite ashamed of it, but laughed heartily at one or two blemishes, and burst into tears as Richard pointed out the hummock near which he had caught the horrid Goby, the source of so much misery. 
               Melancthon expressed his sympathy for the great pecuniary loss which Mr. Dillon had sustained, of which he said he had heard only the preceding day. He could not of course judge, he said, how far it would incommode them, but begged that Mr. Dillon would make free to call upon him for any assistance that he might stand in need of until his fortunes were repaired. Daniel felt that he had no excuse for accepting any further aid than he had already received, and he did not wish to encumber himself with obligations which would only be a charge upon his future income. He, therefore, declined, with many thanks, the offer of his friend. He was to depart on the next day, and Niles, in bidding them farewell, remarked that he designed travelling over a large part of the United States, and might possibly come to Wisconsin; and if so, he said, he should try to find them and pass a few days with them. Kind to all, to Richard and to Elsie he was almost tender in his adieux, and they could scarcely believe him to be the stately and rigid man whom they had met on shipboard on the first day of their voyage. 
               "Nothing but kindness, Yankee or English, it is all the same," said Daniel, when he was gone. "What does it mean, Dicky, my boy?" 
               "Don't know, really," said Dick; "I am expecting every minute to see your friend, the pretended Mr. Blythe, rushing in with the six hundred pounds in his hands, and an extra fifty for interest, and saying it was all a joke." 
               Dick's sally won a laugh as usual, and the preparations for departure were continued. The experiences of the immigrant family for the next few weeks require no minute detail. Premising that they travelled by the rivers, canals and lakes, for the purpose of transporting their horses, and that Granite Joe, having been offered his choice of a life abode in a Sailor's Asylum, and a permanent home with the Dillons had chosen the latter, and accompanied them in their journey, we will precede them to the advanced post of civilization which they sought, and receive them there. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVII. 
               WISCONSIN, at the period now spoken of, was not the Wisconsin of the present day, scarcely thirty thousand inhabitants being then scattered over that extensive territory, which now, with ten times that number, is still but thinly settled. The region in which Mr. Popham had pitched his tent and gathered, by much effort, a few people around him, was remote from the principal settlements of that day, and scarcely within the protection of even the feeble territcial government, which nominally extended over it. Here the speculator had purchased a very large tract of the national domain at a trifling cost, calculating with far-sighted sagacity on the strong tide of immigration which was in a few years to people his estate, and increase ten-fold its value. He had judiciously selected his property, which lay on both sides of a river, that descended with many gentle falls towards the Mississippi, and gave promise of unlimited water-power to the future inhabitants of Pophamville. Extending several miles in width, his lands touched also the borders of three small lakes, one of which was entirely embraced within its limits. The soil was fertile, the climate was beautiful and salubrious, and every thing that Nature could do to render it an attractive residence for man seemed to have been done. In one respect, only, did it fall short of the eulogiums of Mr. Popham, but that was a very material one. It was unpeopled. It was a wilderness, a bright and beautiful one certainly, but still a wilderness. Pophamville was "laid out," it is true, but if it had been "laid out" for interment, it could scarcely have been more silent. The lines of its future streets were marked only by stakes amid the long prairie grass, and its prospective squares and public buildings were indicated by lettered shingles stuck in the ground. Its actual edifices were seven log cabins, and its inhabitants numbered twenty-three in all, including two babies, which to Adonijah's great delight, had been born into the settlement during his absence. 
               The advent of the Dillons in such a place might well be anticipated with interest, as it would nearly double the entire population of the town. Adonijah looked forward with pleasure, but not without solicitude to their arrival, and silently felicitated himself on the reflection, that although they might be dissatisfied with the state of his commonwealth, they probably would not be able to quit it. His own residence or manor-house was the largest of the buildings which have been named, and was distinguished from them by having a chimney of real brick, but Mr. Popham was a public man, and spent much of his time away from his estate, having been in the Territorial Legislature, and in other public stations. His mission abroad had been in the capacity of an agent for some joint stock improvement company, which promised soon to make "the wilderness blossom like the rose." 
               He had proceeded home from New York by the quickest and most direct route, and arrived several weeks before the immigrant family were expected, which interval terval he employed chiefly in making preparations for their arrival. He laid out a farm for them on the finest part of his estate, fronting for half a mile on the river, and bounded on one side by one of the little lakes which have been mentioned. It comprised about a hundred and fifty acres, with a due proportion of timber and arable land, and was altogether such a farm as would have delighted the heart of the practical agriculturist. When the selection was made and the boundaries properly designated, the Governor, as he was called by his few poverty-stricken neighbors, issued his ukase to his subjects to build a house upon the new farm, a summons that was promptly responded to by seven white men and three whiskey-drinking Indians, drawn by some means from a still remoter depth of the wilderness, all of whom under Adonijah's supervision, immediately set about cutting and drawing timber for the building. Two pairs of horses and three ox-teams being the whole disposable cavalry force of the village, were constantly on the ground, and for a few days the sight of the new dwelling presented an animated and bustling scene, which was long remembered in Pophamville. 
               The greatest curiosity was excited, not only by the unusual size of the house, which contained three rooms on the ground floor, and a very decided second story, with real stairs, but by the very liberal and generous manner in which the Governor paid all his subjects, and incited them to do their best. A whole week was spent on the structure, which, when completed, was pronounced on all hands to be a model of forest architecture, and what was most surprising of all, it became apparent, on comparing notes among the builders, after its completion, that the governor had actually paid out the surprising sum of fifty dollars in cash for it, besides inappreciable quantities of good liquor. For what purpose such a magnificent building was designed, unless for a Court-House, or for the Capitol of their future State, none could imagine. 
               But they were not long in doubt. No sooner was the great work finished than Adonijah set out to meet the English family on the Eastern border of the State, at the port on Lake Michigan, which had been agreed upon. So correctly had he calculated their time of travel, that he had only to wait a few days for their arrival, and he had the gratification to find them all, from Daniel down to the dogs, not only well, but in first-rate spirits. 
               "We havn't the least idea where we are," said Mr. Dillon, "We have been going for three weeks steadily along by canals, and rivers, and lakes, far enough to go quite through all the United States and Territories several times I should say; only we have travelled towards all points of the compass at different times, and doubled our track like a fox running before the hounds." 
               "Tis rather a crooked route, certainly, especially this last bout on the upper lakes; you have gone nearly around three sides of a square." 
               "We have not much further to go, I presume?" 
               "No, sir, only a trifle." 
               The trifle proved to be over two hundred miles, which was to be accomplished, in default of all public conveyances, in a long emigrant-wagon, covered with tent-cloth, and drawn by Richard's hunters, and an auxiliary team of scraggy horses, which last-named animals, together with the wagon, had been provided by the indefatigable Mr. Popham, who had also, strangely enough, half filled, the travelling tent with an assortment of housekeeping articles for the use of his new neighbors. 
               It was very funny at first, but grew less so as they advanced, fifteen souls and bodies in one-vehicle, progressing but thirty miles a day, and camping out beside their stationary diligence at night, while the hoppled cattle grazed around them; now alarmed by traces of roving bands of predatory Indians, and once challenged and "brought to," by a dozen of Ojibways, who finding four whole men and several weapons to deal with, uttered a civil "how do," and went off without the beautiful horses they had coveted. It ceased to be funny and became frightful. Belinda fainted entirely away, and continued to do so for the next two days whenever an Indian trail was discovered, and Clara and Elsie, although sustaining themselves better, were almost equally terrified. There was great danger that the savages, whose rapacity was extreme, would reinforce themselves, and return to the charge, and every subsequent hour of their journey was passed in this appalling apprehension. Adonijah rather encouraged this fear, because he thought it would have a tendency to make the immigrants glad to arrive any where, not excepting so uninviting a place as Pophamville. 
               To that remarkable town they came at last on the seventh day of their land journey. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XVIII. 
               "WHERE is it?" said Daniel, and "Where is it?" said Richard, and, "Where is it? Where? Where?" echoed half a dozen other voices, as Adonijah tried to point out to them his capital. 
               "It is not much built up yet," said Popham, as they stopped in front of his own dwelling, "but you'll find it beautifully laid out. I've got a map of it inside, which will give you a better idea of it." 
               "But where are the houses and the streets, and the town-hall, and the-" 
               "Oh! you'll find thorn all on the map; there are more than forty streets; you can't see them very well now, 'cause the grass is pretty long at this season of the year." 
               "But you don't mean seriously to say-" 
               "What?" 
               "Why that this desert is the Pophamville that you have talked so much about?" 
               "Yes." 
               "That you call this a town?" 
               "Yes." 
               "Where we are to live?" 
               "Yes." 
               "It is impossible!" 
               The whole family sat still, as if determined not to alight, until Mr. Popham had conducted them to some place better answering their expectations. 
               "Probably you aint much used to new settlements," said that gentleman, a little uneasy at the spirit manifested by his human freight;" perhaps you don't like it?" 
               "I am sorry to say we have been-" 
               Mr. Dillon was about to add "grossly deceived;" but he remembered the great obligation he was under to Adonijah for the large loan, and for all his gratuitous labor and expense in bringing them over the latter part of their journey, and he was silent. There was a remarkable mystery in the conduct of their forest friend, which he could not fathom; but they owed him too much gratitude to cavil at his peculiarities. 
               "Is this to be our home?" asked Daniel, lugubriously, nodding towards the little house, but still keeping his seat. 
               "No, this is my house; yours, I fear, is not quite dry yet." 
               "O! you have been painting it, then?" 
               "No, I have been building it." 
               "Building it?" 
               "Yes, sir; I have built you a house twice as large as this, on the best farm I have; I have partly furnished it, and I have sixty dollars' worth of cooking traps and other things for you in the wagon there." 
               Daniel descended from the wagon and shook hands with Adonijah, and Richard followed his example, laughing unrestrainedly as he did so. Mr. Popham's wife and two children and three dogs had come out of the house in the mean time, to meet him, and to see the strangers; and all the rest of the villagers were by this time running towards the wagon, and gathering open-mouthed around it. The cavalcade which had stopped at Popham's door was in truth a spectacle well worth witnessing, and the curiosity of the crowd was not sated until long after the immigrants had evacuated their travelling tent, and entered the dwelling of their host, whither some of the "sovereigns" followed uninvited, and continued to stare silently at the strangers. 
               Doleful as was the prospect of the new comers, the sufferings incident to their last week's travel made every privation fit first seem light. They were released from the horrid wagon; they had breathing-room, and elbow-room, and abundance of good food, and a superabundance of appetite, and they resolved to be happy, with the exception of Belinda, who decided to be miserable, and was. Such was their first day's experience, even while confined to the narrow quarters afforded by Mr. Popham's house, which they not only filled, but overflowed, the children swarming on stoops and steps, and outside cellar doors, and swinging on the gates, munching square yards of "Indian bread." 
               Immediately after dinner, the whole family repaired, under Adonijah's guidance, to see the new house, which they contrived to be really pleased with, so much had their anticipation been lowered; and as to the farm, both the Squire and Richard were really quite in ecstacies with it. They estimated correctly enough its capacity to produce most abundrnt harvests, but they were quite unmindful of the fact that there was no possible market for their produce. They retained an abiding, distinct impression that there were large settlements of busy people near to them on every side; for they had never known any different state of things, and they could not for a long time realize that they were living not in, but far beyond, the outskirts of the whole civilized family of America. 
               Fearfully they inquired both the purchase price and the rent of this property, but their extraordinary host refused to negotiate with them. 
               "If it suits you, take it," he said," I'll make out a deed tomorrow. If it don't suit you on trial, I dare say you will leave it here when you go away." 
               He could not be persuaded to make any other terms, and Mr. Dillon, although he would not accept the deed, consented to take possession of the place, trusting to the future to induce his landlord to accept either the purchase-money or the rent. 
               "I think we shall be very well pleased, eh, Dick?" said the senior Mr. Dillon; "we can enlarge and improve our house at our leisure, and, although we certainly need more furniture, yet we can ride to some town one of these days and procure it." 
               "Oh, yes," said Dick, "it will do capitally; and to-morrow I am going to hunt buffaloes." 
               "If Mr. Popham will lend you one of your horses, you can." 
               "Ah! true, I forgot they were pledged to him; but I can go afoot." 
               "What's that you say?" asked Adonijah. "I am not going to be bothered with your horses. They are too fine for any work I have to do, and as to riding one of them, I'd as soon mount a wild elk; besides, I have no place to keep them in." 
               "But the debt-" 
               "Oh, I am not afraid about that; at any rate, I don't mean to increase it by feeding your horses and hounds," said Adonijah, laughing. 
               This ingenious way of conferring an additional favor on the immigrants was a stroke of delicacy, quite beyond any thing they had heretofore given the Wisconsiner credit for. Their admiration of him increased every hour, and they only consented to accept of his repeated favors, because they were confident of being able to repay him every thing out of their future remittances from home. 
               "He is doubtless very rich," said Richard. 
               "Of course; he must have an estate of several thousand acres here, besides, probably, lots of stocks." 
               Anticipation ran high, but it received a check in the evening, when the party had returned to Mr. Popham's, where they were all, in some unaccountable way, to pass the night. Two of the villagers, who had been out hunting, and had returned at nightfall, entered the house in some trepidation, and startled its inmates not a little with the intelligence that they had been attacked by a party of Ojibway Indians, who had pursued them nearly home, and were supposed to be still lurking near the village. In vain did Adonijah by winks and signs to stop the delivery of this terrifying message. The speaker was too full of his subject to understand hints, and concluded by saying- 
               "So you see the red rascals really have found us out at last, and now there will be nothing but war with them, until-" 
               "Nonsense, nonsense," replied Mr. Popham; "what an old croaker you are, Blddgat, to make such an ado about a few harmless savages. They are all at peace with the 'Nited States." 
               "P'raps they are, but what have we got to do with that? We don't live in the. 'Nited States, and scarcely in their Territories. They say the Chippewas claim all these lands." 
               "Suppose they do. The Chippewas aint the Ojibways, but their greatest, enemies; besides, I can show a patent from Government, and I've seen the deed of the Chip-pewas, signed by three grizzly bears, two raccoons, one catamount, and one thunder-cloud-that is to say," he added, in explanation to Mr. Dillon, "these are the names of their Chiefs, you know." 
               "But is it not necessary to take some precautions against an attack from these people?" inquired Mr. Dillon, with much anxiety. "Had not we better send to the nearest town for some assistance and a few cannon?" 
               Adonijah, by a peremptory sign, repressed the laughter and derisive reply which this remark would have elicited. 
               "We will keep lights burning in our houses," he said, "and our weapons loaded, and a few vigilant men shall keep watch. That will doubtless be sufficient. Probably it is the same party that accosted us so civilly on our journey, and all they want is Richard's horses." 
               "Well, do, for mercy's sake, send them the horses, and let them begone then," exclaimed Belinda, in a tone of agony. 
               "Send them the horses!" cried Dick, indignantly; "I rather think we won't, if it's all the same to you, Belinda. Perhaps your watch and jewels might prove as good a peace-offering." 
               "Any thing of the kind would only increase their rapacity, and draw their whole tribe upon us in a few days," replied Adonijah; "the best tiding we can send them is a few bullets." 
               "Why not cannon-balls?" asked Daniel. 
               "Bullets will answer every purpose. Indians are the greatest cowards in the world; only show a good front and kill two or three of them, and the whole tribe will avoid you forever afterwards." 
               But, despite Mr. Popham's encouragement, and the light manner in which he treated the danger, the immigrant family were in the greatest alarm, and began now most seriously to rue their unfortunate choice of a home. But they remembered the counterbalancing advantages which they had derived from the patronage of Adonijah, and the extreme difficulty, if not impossibility, of now making any favorable change in their location, and they resolved to make the best of their bad fortune. 
               Every man who retired to rest that night first saw his gun well loaded and placed near his bedside, and both the Dillons, father and son, together with Granite Joe, remained up and dressed throughout the night, occasionally venturing to peer through a dark window, or a cautiously-opened door, and fully anticipating a shower of arrows and tomahawks every time they did so. They regarded the regular sentinels who were posted without as a sort of "forlorn hope," whose chance of living through the night was exceedingly small, while of the men themselves, one, after an hour's stupid staring, dropped asleep on the grass, and another passed his time in digging post-holes for an anticipated fence. 
               Adonijah retired to his room under pretence of going to sleep as usual, for it was his policy to show a contempt of the threatened invasion, and to allay the fears of his new friends. 
               "If the red rascals should really venture to come," he said, ostentatiously to one of his subjects, "give them one good round of bullets, and that will suffice; but pray don't disturb me for any thing less than a hundred of them." 
               "P'raps ef many on 'em come, Squire, you'd better get up and tell 'em about the treaty," said the subject, derisively. 
               "Or how would it do to read the riot act to them?" asked Daniel, anxiously. "We'll try the powder and ball first," replied Popham, as he withdrew to his room. 
               Richard's horses were secured in a rude stable or shed, which was barricaded by a few logs piled against the door, while the less valuable animals, which would not be so likely to excite the cupidity of the foe, were hoppled and turned out to graze. 
               But the night passed off without disturbance from the enemy. If any attack was meditated, the precaution taken by the villagers had prevented its being made, and the dawn of day brought a happy relief to all parties, but especially to the members of the immigrant family, none of whom, excepting the younger children, had slept an hour. Adonijah made his appearance early in the morning, yawning prodigiously, and pretending to have slept very soundly, whereas he had in reality passed the night, gun in hand, at his bed-room window, and once had been on the very point of firing, as he thought, at an Indian creeping cautiously on all fours towards the house, when he discovered that the assailant was one of his own hogs. He exulted loudly over the result, and his "I told you so's" were so many and so frequent, and his assurances of perfect safety so loudly and so often iterated, that a sense of security gradually took possession of all hearts. A little vigilance was exercised for the few succeeding nights, but the perfect quietude in which they passed, contributed to allay alarm, and to lull, unfortunately too much, the fears even of the most timid. 
               Weeks passed thus. The Dillons moved into their own house, and busied themselves in rendering it more comfortable, and in preparing to cultivate their land. Richard hunted and fished with a completeness of success which banished every thing else from his thoughts. There were forests and hills within a few miles of their prairie home, abounding in game which scarcely knew enough of man to fly before him, and Richard always returned from his expeditions not only with his horse heavily laden with spoils, but often reporting a portion left behind, which was to be returned for the next morning. Deer and moose, foxes, squirrels, wild turkeys, pigeons and pheasants, were among his victims, while now and then a sluggish black bear fell before his unerring gun, and its shaggy head, perched on the pommel of his saddle, graced his triumphal return. His father seldom accompanied him in these forays, for he and Granite Joe were busy in farming operations, and although a younger brother frequently went with him, it was rather as a spectator than as a participant of his sport. 
               Dick was in his element, happy as a king, and making every one happy around him, for all sympathised in his sports, and enjoyed his successes. He had the satisfacion, too, of keeping the family table well supplied with luxurious food, and not only so, but much of the time every other table in the settlement besides. Dick, in short, fed the town. His meat and his praise were in every man's mouth. The villagers all idolized him, and stood ready to do every thing in their power, not only for him, but for all the English family. 
               "It was worth while to come here, if it were only for the fun it gives Dicky and the boys," said Elsie, one afternoon, when Richard had returned from the forest with unusual success. 
               "Ah, I wish our friend Niles was here to have some of this sport, or even our poor cousin Upton," replied Richard. 
               "Poor cousin Upton, indeed!" exclaimed Belinda; "I only wish he would send me his income for one month, which would be a thousand pounds, and I would turn my back upon Pophamville, and agree never to see it, nor any thing in it, again, to the last day of my life." 
               "Oh, Belinda, you always make the worst of every thing." 
               "Do I, indeed? Well, perhaps I do; but one thing is certain there is no such thing as making out things worse than they are in Pophamville. Aint we in the desert, among Indians and wild beasts, and without a soul to see or speak to from one week's end to another." 
               "We have ourselves," said Elsie, laughing-"and I am sure I think we are a very select and choice society." 
             
             
               CHAPTER XIX. 
               IT was now midsummer, and the immigrant family were on the third month of their forest life. The climate had proved generally favorable to them, with the exception of Elsie, whose health and spirits had gradually failed. She was patient and uncomplaining, but she visibly drooped; her strength had diminished, and her step had lost its lightness and elasticity. Medical advice was entirely unattainable, but her father wisely counselled her to partake freely of out-door exercise, and with Richard or one of her younger brothers for her companion, she took many long walks about the farm and the neighboring country. They had as yet no wheeled vehicle, but Richard, with the aid of an ingenious laborer, contrived to manufacture a serviceable, though inelegant, side-saddle of deer-skin for her use, and taught her to ride the gentlest though fleetest of his steeds. Until she was well accustomed to this exercise, he was invariably her attendant in riding, but when she grew stronger and well able to manage her palfrey, he entrusted her often to the care of his brother Sidney, a stout, brave lad of fourteen, who was himself a well-trained equestrian. 
               Sidney liked nothing better than this kind of squireship, which he performed very well, and in general with great regard for his sister's comfort, but he was a venturous lad, and was perpetually urging Elsie to extend her expeditions farther from home than her ideas of prudence dictated, and often into parts new and unknown to either of them. 
               Kind and complying in her disposition, Elsie found it difficult to always resist his importunities, and every concession that was made with impunity not only diminished her fears, but furnished her brother with an additional argument for his future solicitations. Their excursions, too, were through most pleasant and romantic scenery, now extending for miles along the river's side, and now around the curved shore of a glassy lake, where the white pebbles rattled beneath their horses' hoofs, and where at every turn they started flocks of wild fowl into the air, or sent them diving into the blue wave to rise at a remoter and more secure distance from the shore. At times, too, they galloped along the base of the forest-clad hills, safe on their fleet steeds from any attack of the wild animals which were known to inhabit them, and never dreaming of other danger. 
               So fascinating did Elsie find these exercises, that she scarcely intermitted them for a single day, excepting for the purpose of allowing Richard to resume his hunting, for poor Dick had been obliged almost entirely to forego that amusement; but he little heeded that privation, when he saw the color return to his sister's cheeks, and heard the merry laugh which told of her returning health and strength. 
               It was at this juncture of affairs that the English family, and indeed all Pophamville, were thrown into great excitement by the arrival of a stranger from Milwaukie, who had travelled post-haste, on a good steed, for twelve days in search of their village. He had been as far west as the Mississippi, and up to Fort --, where he ad heard that there was a settlement sixty or seventy miles distant, in a direction very nearly co-incident with the route which he had come over, and even after this instruction he did not succeed in finding Adonijah's capital without several days' further search, nor until he had passed around it in every direction, among the little lakes and rivers that abound in that region, and was on the point of abandoning the search. 
               But important as was the circumstance of the arrival of the stranger, the fact, which soon became known, that he bore a letter for somebody, was still more so. Adonijah did not doubt at first that it was for himself, and thought it must have been sent to announce his appointment to some distinguished office, but he was soon undeceived. The messenger in quired at once for the Dillons, and urged his weary steed to their dwelling, where he dismounted and delivered his letter to Daniel. 
               It proved to be from Mr. Niles, announcing his arrival at the Lake port which has been named, and his intention of paying his friends a visit as soon as he could learn heir whereabout. He had been unable, he said to find Pophamville laid down on any map, or to find any one who knew any thing of such a place, and he had resorted to this mode of search for it before venturing personally into the wilderness. His messenger, he said, was instructed to ascertain as nearly as possible the latitude and longitude of the lost town, and the most direct route to it, and to report to him with all speed. Mr. Niles also expressed the greatest surprise to find that Pophamville was so obscure a place, and that it was seemingly in no immediate proximity to any settled part of the Territory, and at this part of his letter several lines were carefully erased, of which a few words were decyphered to the purport that if he had known it he certainly never should have- 
               "What?" was the question on every one's lip. 
               But nothing more could be made out. 
               "Why he never would have consented to come, of course," said Belinda. 
               "I do not think it is that," said Elsie. 
               "Why not, Miss Wise-acre?" asked her sister. 
               "Because-because-he is a gentleman, and would never dream of saying any thing so rude." 
               "Very true," said Dick, "it cannot be that," and the riddle was abandoned as insoluble. 
               Great was the rejoicing at the prospect of the promised visit, and the pleasure extended throughout the settlement, for every one sympathized with the happiness of the Dillons. The messenger, after a day's rest, and after procuring the required geographical information set out on his return, bearing letters of most cordial import from both Daniel and his son to their friend, and as he now travelled by compass, and in a direct line homeward, he accomplished his journey in less than five days. 
               At the end of another week, one of the villagers, who had been upon a neighboring hill, reported two horsemen in view on the prairie, travelling towards the settlement, and Adonijah ordered every thing in readiness, either for a defence of the town, or for a hospitable reception, as circumstances might require. 
               "They might be Ojibways," he said, "and there might be more coming, for some of these red rascals have good horses, and there are rumors of a number of them having been seen within a few days, on the hills, northward of the town." 
               But the governor's fears were soon dispelled. In half an hour Mr. Niles mounted on a large, strong steed, accompanied by his former messenger, entered the village, and was met, as it were, upon its threshold by nearly all the male citizens. Richard was foremost to welcome him, fairly dragging him from his saddle as he did so, and Melancthon's delight at seeing him seemed quite unbounded. There was evidently the greatest congeniality of disposition between these young men, and they now met as brothers who had been long parted, and whose early intimacy had never been interrupted by unkindness or suspicion. No less friendly, although a shade less cordial, was the greeting between Mr. Niles and the elder Dillon; but his salutation of Mr. Popham was formal and reserved, while Adonijah on his part showed much embarrassment, and failed in every effort to resume his usual brusque air. 
               The visiter proceeded at once to the house of Mr. Dillon, where the ladies had in readiness for him both a hearty welcome and a hearty repast; for they had in memory their own privations in travelling across the territory, and they knew well how desirable a good and speedy meal would prove to their friend. 
               The excitement incident to the first half hour of this happy interview seemed to render every one forgetful of the absence of one member of the family excepting the guest himself, who turned many inquiring glances towards the door at each successive opening, and each time withdrew his eyes with a disappointed air. He at length inquired if Elsie was well and at home. 
               "Quite well now," replied Richard, "but this is her hour for riding, which she has practised almost daily during the last month for her health. She and Sidney are galloping across the country in some direction, and I wonder you did not see them, for I heard Sid urging her to take the eastern road." 
               "They went quite another way," said Clara, laughing; "towards Mount Melancthon, as Richard calls the hill on the north side of us." 
               "Ah, have I the honor to have a mountain named after me?" asked Niles. 
               "Une petite colline," said Dick, "but the nearest approach to a mountain that, we have in this neighborhood." 
               "It is as large as its name would justify, I dare say," replied Melancthon. 
               "No, we should have given you a larger, if we had had it, but what is one to do in such a level country? It is very green, however, if that counts for any thing," said Dick, laughing, "for it is covered with a thick forest." 
               Niles laughed, and made some playful reply, but at this moment a shout followed by a scream was heard without, and then one of the boys rushed in to say that Sidney had returned alone, and had fallen fainting from his horse on the lawn. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XX. 
               EVERY one rushed out in a state of alarm, which, intense as it was, was destined to be fearfully augmented. The swooning boy, when slowly resuscitated, could say nothing for some seconds but "Elsie! Elsie! Elsie!" pointing with a terrified air to the woods. 
               "What is it, in Heaven's name?" asked Richard, kneeling before his prostrate brother. 
               "The 'Jibways! The 'Jibways! They have carried her off!" 
               A scene of indescribable horror followed. Consternation seized every heart, and seemed to paralyze every tongue, and it was several minutes before it was possible to gain any more precise information of the dreadful event. When Sidney was better able to speak, he informed them that, while riding slowly along the base of the hill, they suddenly heard the sound of galloping horses behind them, and at the next instant they were surrounded by about forty Indians, ten or twelve of whom were on horseback, and who must have descended from the woods. The savages immediately seized both the horses, but Cassius, which the boy rode, reared and plunged so violently as to frighten his captors, who were compelled to relinquish their hold of him, and the maddened animal dashed off, with his rider clinging to him, and utterly unable to stop or control him until he reached home. He had been able to observe, however, the course which the Indians took with their prisoner, which was, he said, up the hill-side, in a north-westerly direction, and towards the thickest portion of the forest. 
               "My rifle and pistols, Sidney! Bring them quickly!" cried Richard, seizing the bridle of his steed, and trying to soothe the irritated animal. 
                
               "And mine!" exclaimed Niles; 'Whitley, you will go with us. Let our horses be instantly brought out." 
               "Wal, I reckon not, Squire!" said Melancthon's guide; "I don't much like the looks of this business, though I am very sorry for the gal, sartainly." 
               "Very well-we want no cowards; go, at least, and bring out the horses, if you are not afraid to do that." 
               "I go with you, of course," said Daniel, "and I must have one of the horses." 
               "Let me go, if you please," said Granite Joe, addressing Niles, "I can handle a musket pretty well, and if we should come hand to hand, I am good for three Indians any day, besides knowing a Narraghanset war-whoop that will frighten the white-livered rascals out of their wits. Let me go, I pray," continued he, brandishing with violence a hoe, which he had brought with him from his work. "I'll do any thing for Miss Elsie, and I aint a whit afraid of a thousand of em." 
               "You shall certainly go, my good fellow, if you can find a horse," replied Niles, "but you must be prompt." 
               By this time Mr. Popham, who was not at the house of Mr. Dillon at the time of the alarm, was seen running towards the excited group, himself scarcely less excited. 
               "I know all about it," he said, breathlessly; "don't be in too great haste, or rather make haste slowly, as we used to say at school. I'll go with you, and every man in town besides, though there is, only four horses; but the men are good runners, and them that can't ride will follow on foot. They have got the news, and are all arming themselves, for they have all good muskets and ammunition, and are piping hot with wrath against the red devils, and every man is ready to lay down his life for Miss Elsie. Besides that, I have sent for three or four Chippewas, who are in my interest, and who will be of the greatest service to us, both as guides and combatants." 
               Melanctnon grasped Mr. Popham's hand, and shook it cordially, while Richard and his father expressed their gratitude in words. His advice was taken, and in thirty minutes they had a cavalry force of seven well-armed and well-mounted men, besides as many more foot-soldiers, including three Chippewas. The muskets of Adonijah's men were part of a lot which he had procured a year previous at a government arsenal for the defence of his little State, and which, having flint-locks, had been discarded in favor of the percussion improvement. Although he had for that reason been able to purchase them very cheaply, they were good, serviceable weapons, and were all provided with bayonets, an appendage usually superfluous in Indian engagements, but which he did not allow to be laid aside. He had enough of these guns, not only for his own people, but for the Chippewas, who also carried their knives, and their unfailing tomahawks. Mr. Dillon and Richard each had a good rifle, and each a pair of pistols, besides which Daniel girded on a sword that had been many years in his possession, but which he did not know very well how to handle, having never appropriated it to any other than mere ornamental service. Mr. Niles had two braces of pistols, with which he had provided against the dangers of his prairie journey, and was about assuming also one of Adonijah's muskets, when Mr. Dillon offered him his sword, saying- 
               "I am not quite certain that I could use it to advantage. Perhaps you can." 
               Melahcthon accepted it with a look of very evident satisfaction. 
               "I think I can," he said, significantly; "they called me the second best fencer at Oxford, and I think I must be first best, among the Ojibways. This is a fine blade, and worthy of a nobler foe." 
               The musket which Mr. Niles laid aside, Granite Joe volunteered to carry, in addition to his own, in order that it might be at hand if needed by that gentleman during the excursion. 
               "And now, if it please your honors," said Joseph to the gentlemen, while the party awaited some supplies of ammunition, "I should like to know who is Captain of this company, so that I can tell whose orders I am to obey for, you see, there is no doing any thing without a captain, nor with more than one." 
               "Very true, and thought of in good time," replied the senior Mr. Dillon; "but we have no time to lose in discussing the matter, and I take the liberty of suggesting, for our leader, the gentleman who already bears the insignia of command, if he will accept the post. Several of us have seen his coolness, decision, and energy, in a former case of great danger, and have reason to feel the greatest confidence in him." 
               The nomination was confirmed by acclamation, and Melancthon promptly accepted the command, and named Richard as his aid. 
               "But, remember, that I am to be implicitly obeyed. The prompt manner in which these brave men," he said, turning to Mr. Popham's townsmen and their red allies, "have engaged in this enterprise is worthy of all praise. But I, hope it is not improper to lay another inducement to action before them, in the shape of prizemoney. I, therefore, promise to pay every man twenty-five dollars a day during our brief campaign, and if we return successful, I will also divide five hundred guineas among the men." 
               A shout of applause followed this announcement, and then a confused sound of many voices talking. 
               "He can't do it," said one, "he aint the President of the Bank of England, I guess." 
               "Ef Mr. Popham would just be responsible for that are now," said another. 
               "I will be responsible for it," answered Adonijah, "with every dollar I have, and every acre of ground that I own." 
               Another hurrah now went up, and there was a general appearance of joy and satisfaction among the men. 
                
               "I rayther think, on the hull, I'll go along, Squire," said Whitley, sidling up to Mr. Niles. 
               "I rather think you won't," replied the leader; "cowardice is a contagious disease, and you might infect the whole army." 
               "Wal, I aint particular. I suppose if I stay and pertect the women folks, I shall be entitled to my share of the prize money," said the guide, walking coolly away. 
               Melancthon now whispered a moment with Richard, and then said to Mr. Popham- 
               "We shall have no time to lose in waiting for the footmen to come up. Let the five white men who have no horses ride with those of their companions who are best mounted. As to the Indian runners, I am told that they can keep up with us, besides, we shall want them on foot to keep the trail." 
               This advice was quickly carried into effect, and the next minute, it being but little more than half an hour after Sidney's arrival home, the little cavalcade was in rapid motion towards the forest. They took the route which Sidney had indicated, and followed the base of the hill in a westerly direction, until they reached the opening of a ravine of great extent, the sides of which sloped more gradually upward than the outer acclivity, and was far easier of ascent. 
               The guides were at once directed to alight, and seek the trail of the foe, which they soon struck, and followed with a celerity and confidence quite incomprehensible to the English portion of the party, who could scarcely see, even when it was pointed out to them, an occasional and very rare track of a horse shoe amidst the thick leaves and underbrush of the woods. Melancthon now dismounted and led his horse, and directed every man to follow his example, preserving the strictest silence. When they had gained the summit, they all remounted, the guides now running rapidly forward, and indicating the trail with the accuracy, and almost the speed of hounds in pursuit of a fox. 
               A quarter of an hour's ride brought them to the opposite side of the mountain, where at the beginning of the descent, one of the runners picked up a lady's glove, and handed it up triumphantly to the leader of the band. Anticipating the emotion which this discovery would cause in other breasts, as it did in his own, Mr. Niles made a signal for silence; he held it for a moment towards Richard, who pressed it to his lips, while scalding tears fell upon the precious memento; and then, resuming possession of it, Melancthon fastened it beneath his hat-band, and the party continued its progress. 
               Every heart beat high with sympathy, and with resolution, while this brief but expressive pantomime was being acted, and had the savage foe then appeared in sight, the charge upon them must have been one of irresistible impetuosity. But the pursuers were not to be so readily gratified. The trail led them down the declivity, and several milos across the level country, to the side of one of the numerous rivers which flow westward to the Mississippi. Here the guides discovered traces of two canoes which had recently been drawn up on the beach, and in which part of the enemy were supposed to have embarked, while the mounted part of the band had evidently continued their route along the side of the stream. 
               By the distance between the tracks now seen, and the distinctness of them, the Chippewas judged that the party had passed very rapidly and very recently, and without any further attempt at concealment, doubtless trusting to their advantageous start and to the speed of their horses for escape. The pursuers pressed vigorously forward for many miles, but, alas! the day was fast declining, and all felt the unspeakable importance of overtaking the enemy before nightfall. Although no word of discouragement was spoken, Melancthon and Richard exchanged apprehensive glances as they looked at the descending sun, and each seemed to feel that, with the decadence of that luminary, the sun of hope would also go down. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXI. 
               ANOTHER hour was passed in silence. The sun went down, and twilight succeeded to day, and darkness succeeded to twilight, without discovering the enemy, although every eye had been or the alert, scanning both the land and the river as far as vision reached. Through all that time, until darkness concealed it from their view, the trail had continued plain and apparent, and led in a straight and undeviating line along the river's side; but when they could no longer see it, all was uncertainty and irresolution. It might at any point lead aside to the neighboring hills, and if they pressed forward, they were in momentary danger of falling into an ambuscade 
               Melancthon ordered a halt for consultation. His own resolution and determination increased with every obstacle, and wrought to the highest pitch of excitement by the nature of his enterprise, he felt that ardent and impulsive valor which would have urged him single-handed into the ranks of the enemy. But he did not know the minds of his followers, with the exception of the Dillons, and he greatly feared encountering a proposition to return. Richard's apprehensions on this score were still greater, for he did not even feel confident that their leader himself would advocate a further prosecution of so dangerous and hopeless an enterprise. How, indeed, could he expect that a man fresh from the refinements of European life, a man of wealth and fashion, too, as his new friend seemed to be, should be willing freely to risk his life among the savages of the new world, in behalf of people who had no claim upon him beyond that which results from the common brotherhood of the human family. He knew, indeed, that his sister possessed sessed uncommon personal attractions, and great loveliness of disposition, but he did not flatter himself that she had been the magnet which had drawn their visitor from the Atlantic coasts so far into the desert West, or which now impelled him forward to brave every danger with unflinching valor. 
               But he did not know his friend, and his heart bounded with joy as, the first words of Melancthon fell upon his ears, in a tone of energy and decision. 
               "My friends," he said, calmly: "the darkness which has overtaken us renders it necessary that we should proceed henceforward with more circumspection; perhaps with some change in the order of our march. I am convinced that we are on the eve of success. Our enemies are unsuspicious of pursuit, or they never would have left such distinct traces of their route. If unsuspicious, they are by this time encamped at no great distance from us. We can surprise them; we can rout them; we can rescue their captive: I wait for your views." 
               Every voice responded assent to these sentiments, and Richard and his father overwhelmed their generous friend with thanks for his zeal in their cause. Not a syllable was lisped about returning, but all seemed to be inspired with new ardor by their commander's words; they were fierce for the attack, and laughed at the danger. Mr. Pop-ham was by no means an exception to this rule, for, although not personally remarkable for bravery, his pecuniary interests were at stake, and he longed to chastise the invaders of his common wealth. But if others were courageous, Granite Joe was rampant courage itself. No words nor gestures could express his fierce eagerness for the fray. Let him only get a the cowardly dogs, he said, he would shoot them, bayonet them, throttle them, tear them limb from limb, and he asked no other favor than that he might have three a+ a time to deal with, and a fresh set every three minutes. His rage infused itself, also, in no small degree into the breasts of his associates. 
               The views of the Chippewas were next taken, and were found to coincide with those of Melancthon; they advised to proceed slowly and cautiously, and that every individual should watch for lights in the distance, because, they said, if the enemy encamped under the supposition that they were not pursued, they would probably light a small fire among the bushes to cook with. 
               Their calculations proved correct. The pursuing party resumed their progress, and had not proceeded half a mile before one of the Indians laid his hand upon Melancthon's bridle, and brought the whole party to a stand. He then pointed out a light scarcely exceeding that of a glow-worm, on the river-side, nearly a mile in advance, and proclaimed it to be the enemy's camp. Dubious as this confident opinion appeared to Mr. Niles, the other Chippewas fully concurred in it, and one of their number was at once despatched to reconnoitre, while the main body continued to advance slowly, and in great excitement. 
               In a short time the messenger returned with a full confirmation of his suspicions, having been within thirty rods of the encampment, which was, he said, among some scattered bushes on the bank of the stream, their small fire being nearly hidden by the thick shrubbery which surrounded it. A few of the enemy were lying down, and some were sitting upon the ground around the fire, but the greater part of the band, he supposed, were concealed from him by the bushes. He did not see Miss Dillon, nor could he form any guess as to what part of the camp she was in. 
               This intelligence fired every heart with the desire for immediate action; but the plan of the attack was first to be carefully decided upon, both on account of the numerical superiority of the foe, and the great danger which would accrue to Elsie from any random shots of the assailants. Much perplexity resulted from this difficulty, as it was highly important to infuse a panic among the foe by a fierce and sudden attack. 
               After a short consultation, it was resolved that the attack should be made on foot, with the exception of the leader and the two Dillons, who all had good steeds, and weapons which could be best used on horseback. The remainder of the company, headed by Mr. Popham, were to charge with fixed bayonets, and every man was strictly enjoined that, until he had seen Miss Dillon rescued and placed out of danger, he was not to fire, excepting in cases where he had his enemy directly before him. 
               The Dillons and Melancthon had calculated on being able to use their pistols on horseback with good effect, and without danger to Elsie, while the three strong and powerful steeds themselves, being of an entirely different kind from any known to the savages, were expected to do no small service in terrifying the foe. But Mr. Niles' main personal reliance was upon his sword, which felt familiar to his grasp, and imparted to him a strength and confidence which made him eager for the fray. 
               Orders were issued that the assailants should proceed slowly and in perfect silence, until their leader gave the signal for the attack, which would be when they were within a few rods of the camp, or sooner if they were discovered, and then the Chippewas were to sound their war-cry, aided not only by Granite Joe, who had especially volunteered his services in that line, but by every man in the company who could scream. 
               "Capt. Niles will excuse me," said Mr. Popham, formally, "for cautioning him and the other gentlemen on horseback, to hold a very tight rein at that particular moment, for your horses, you see, won't probably understand the kind of serenade these Chippewas will give They'll think there are five hundred wolves after them, and a smart sprinkling of catamounts. In short, sir, their war-whoop is altogether infernal." 
               "Thank you," said Niles, "I will answer for my horse, and our friends hear your warning. Remember, on your part, that we look for a steady charge from your bayonets." 
               "Never fear for us, sir-we'll spear them like eels, we will, sir." 
               The order was now given to march, and every heart beat high with anxious anticipation, but not another word was said until the band was within thirty rods of the foe, when Melancthon, leaning from his saddle, grasped the hand of Richard, and whispered- 
               "If I fall, and you survive me, open my portmanteau, and read the papers you will find there; they will throw light upon some obscure points." 
               Richard returned the pressure of his friend's hand, but made no other reply. They proceeded, they approached unobserved within sixty yards of the adversary, and as they drew nigh, they saw by the flickering embers full twenty men, stretched upon the ground, and a knot of about a dozen more sitting near the fire, their faces dimly lighted by its glow, apparently conversing, or listening to some narrative from one of their number. Farther back, and more concealed by the bushes, they saw the faint outline of other figures, and also the horses of the party, which seemed to be tethered in a cluster, but, like the scout, they saw nothing of Elsie, who, they supposed, was guarded with extraordinary care in the least exposed part of the tent. 
               Breathlessly they went on, until half the remaining interval was overcome, the assailing party each moment expecting to hear both the sentinel's alarm and the signal for the onset, and all impatient for the word. 
               Another instant, and both were heard, and with them rose to Heaven a cry so wild, so loud, and so tumultuous, so seemingly composed of every hideous and discordant noise that man or beast could utter, that Melancthon, although prepared for something terrific, could scarcely believe himself on the hither side of Pandemonium. He had drawn his sword, however, and struck his spurs into his steed, with the first notes that sounded, and the whole party rushed with the speed of wind upon the foe. 
               The sleepers sprang, as if electrified, to their feet, but ere they could look around them, or grasp their weapons, the three horsemen were in their midst, trampling them down, while the swords and pistols of their riders were doing a fearful work of execution. For a moment of time the Ojibways saw no other assailants than the three leaders, and they began to close around them, with upraised knives and hatchets, and shouting their own tremendous war-cry, when Adonijah's men, like a rushing blast, were upon them. These were nominally led by Popharn himself, but really by Granite Joe, who had leaped far ahead of the ranks, and bearing a musket, with fixed bayonet, in each hand, he flew, heedless of orders, into the thickest of the dark crowd before him, and using his weapons like darts, he transfixed two of the foe at once, and bore them to the earth. Unable readily to extricate his bayonets, he discharged the muskets into the prostrate bodies to which they were affixed, and abandoned them, to possess himself of the handier hatchets of his victims. With these he flew frantically forward wherever he saw the enemy the thickest, and every where he cleared a swath, like a reaper, before him, and carried terror into the hearts of the foe. 
               On another side of the little field, the silent weapon of Melancthon was doing equal execution, and creating a still greater panic, for its mysterious blows fell on either side of his bounding steed with the rapidity of thought, and seldom fell upon the empty air. Slaying some, and wounding all it encountered, the shrieks of its victims were the testimonials of its efficacy. But if Melancthon and the sailor were especially valiant, the remainder of their party were in nowise remiss in bravery. So fierce, indeed, was the attack, and so impetuous on all sides, that within three minutes after the first onset the foe fell back, and attempted to secure their horses for flight, but as they yielded, the whole band of the assailants advanced more hotly upon them, and the retreat became a flight promiscuous and headlong. A few only succeeded in throwing themselves upon their horses, the greater part of which remained still tethered in the rear of the camp. 
               To this point, without deigning to pursue the ignominious foe, the whole victorious party rushed to find the fair captive for whom they had done and risked so much. But, alas, for the heart-riven parent and brother, alas! for the generous friend, they found her not. All search, all calls-and the valley became vocal with her shouted name-were in vain.-There was no response, and the maddening conviction forced itself upon the minds of her friends that the savages had either killed her before their flight, or had carried her with them. To pursue further seemed hopeless, for the fugitives had dispersed in very direction, like Arabs in the desert. 
               When every foot of ground in and near the camp had been carefully examined, with some hope that the unfortunate girl might be found living, though unable to respond to their cries, but with more fear of finding her mangled remains, they next looked to see if the steed Brutus remained among the captured horses, but he also was gone-a circumstance which perhaps added to the probability of Elsie having been carried off by the retreating foe. 
               A consultation was now again held by the dejected leaders of the little band. Defeated in the main object of their enterprise, they bore the appearance of conquered men, rather than of those who had been so signally victorious in battle. The bodies of a dozen savages lay lifeless around them, and several others living remained at their mercy, while of their own company, although many were seriously wounded, not one was slain. Yet no one seemed disposed to exult. Even Granite Joe, resting from his gigantic efforts, and leaning, soiled and blood-stained, against a tree, beside the still flickering fire, looked more like a captive awaiting his doom than a hero expecting his laurels. 
               Melancthon, with an effort, rallied his own spirits, and tried to encourage his companions. 
               "We will pursue them still further," he said; "we may not indeed be able to do so to-night, for they have fled in many ways, and there is no light to show us a single track; but the first dawn of morning will reveal to our faithful allies their principal trail, and guide us on our way." 
               A silent assent was given to these sentiments, but there was no enthusiasm nor animating hope. It was then suggested by Adonijah that some information might be extorted from the wounded savages, who remained upon the field, unable to fly, and on investigation several were found seriously but not mortally hurt; but it was impossible for some time to make them comprehend the desire of their conquerors, or to convince them that they had any thing to expect but immediate death at their conquerors hands. They drew their light blankets closer around them, and lowering their heads, calmly awaited the fatal stroke which they anticipated. When induced at length to give heed to the signs and gestures by which they were interrogated, for even the Chippewas did not understand the Ojibway language, they seemed speedily to surmise what was required of them, and with looks of exultation and triumph they pointed westward down the river, chaunting some unintelligible words as they did so, and plainly implying that the prisoner was gone in that direction. All further and more minute inquiries elicited only the same reply, with the same triumphant air, and was followed on the part of, the captives by signs For despatch in their own execution. 
               There was evidently nothing further to be done until daylight came to their aid, and with this conviction the victors prepared to encamp on the field of battle. They had not come unprovided with food, and all who would were enabled to partake of a refreshing meal. The Chippewas and Granite Joe volunteered to act as a picket guard, and, with such vigilant eyes around them, the remaining members of the company felt that they might fearlessly seek such slight repose as a couch of sod could afford to a heart of grief. 
               Weapon in hand, they lay down on the green-sward, beneath the summer sky, some to the dreamless sleep of physical fatigue, and some to the fitful, feverish slumbers of bodily inquietude and mental distress. 
             
             
                
               CHAPTER XXII. 
               WHEN Elsie Dillon first saw the horrible cavalcade which so suddenly surrounded her at the base of Mount Melancthon; when she saw fierce savages clinging to the bridle of her plunging horse, and felt others grasping with rude Hands her delicate arms, and heard the ferocious shouts and exultations of her fiendish captors, she felt such an appalling consciousness of her terrible fate, such a conviction that she was the doomed victim of the most terrific of human tragedies, that the very magnitude of her misfortune, and its seemingly remediless character, appeared to sustain her from utter prostration of reason, and to give her that power which often, accompanies despair, of looking calmly at her fate. She did not swoon. She remained entirely conscious of her situation, and saw, and heard, and noted, with the minuteness almost of an indifferent observer, every thing that passed. 
               When she saw her brother's horse break from his captors, and dash across the prairie, bearing him away from the danger, her heart leaped with a joy which made her for a few moments wholly forgetful of her own position. When a dozen bended bows, and half as many muskets, were aimed at the fugitive, she put up her hands imploringly, and begged the savages, in a language they did not understand, not to fire. But the weapons proved innocuous against the lad, and at the next moment, in the heat of disappointed rage, several were turned towards herself. With closed eyes, she murmured a prayer, as she waited for death, but the cupidity of the enemy saved her for a moment, for they feared to injure the beautiful horse which they had captured, and on which she still sat. 
               A consultation was next held, seemingly upon the disposal of the captive, during which one amused himself by flourishing a knife around her head, and seemed to await only the decision of his superiors, to execute his fiendish threats. Seeking in no way to avert a fate which she supposed decided, but mindful only of her eternal interests, Elsie looked earnestly heavenward, and prayed fervently, thankful for each added moment that was left, for prayer. It is not improbable that this astonishing fortitude had its effect upon men who are never insensible to any display of courage or greatness of soul; but, however this may be, they seemed suddenly to change their intentions in regard to their prisoner. Making signs to her to retain her seat, one of the horsemen took hold of the bridle of her steed, and the whole party set out in the direction whence they had come. 
               Their course is already known. They travelled with haste, yet not with great rapidity, probably not daring to weaken their party by separating the horsemen from those on foot. Their progress up the hillside was difficult and slow, and Elsie began to entertain a faint hope of pursuit and rescue. But, alas! who was there to come to her aid against such a host? Her father, her brother, and the sailor Joseph, she knew would make the attempt; but she did not, expect that any of the rude villagers would risk life or limb for her, and of Mr. Niles' arrival she knew nothing. 
               Observing the care with which the savages selected their path, in order to leave the least trace of their steps, she thought of a plan to counteract in part their efforts, and, watching her opportunity, when seeming to cling closest to her horse for support, she dropped at intervals each of her gloves, her bracelet, and finally, with much trepidation, her handkerchief. All but the last were unobserved, but this was picked up and restored to her on the point of a knife, with a significant and threatening gesture. 
               They crossed the mountain, they descended its northern side, they proceeded in a north westerly direction across the prairies, nearly in silence, and without pausing. At times the horsemen looked back, to see if they were pursued, and one lingered on the summit of the hill to watch, while the rest of the band were descending to the plain. Elsie shuddered as she saw their ferocious faces, and she began to hope earnestly that her father and brother might not follow her to what seemed such certain destruction. She remained calm, and with all her faculties at her command, trusting firmly in God; not, indeed, with any feeling of certainty that He would save her from death, but certain of His power to do so, and believing that if, as every thing now indicated, He willed otherwise, it was still best for her, and it was her duty to submit. She prayed for grace to do so. With the faith and resignation of a martyr, uncomplaining, undoubting, almost unterrified, the angel-child, a picture of purity and loveliness, with her bright blue eyes turned ever and anon to Heaven, and her lips moving in prayer, rode forward amidst her dark and frowning captors, brighter, purer, lovelier by the contrast, like a star of silver light glowing upon the edge of a storm cloud. 
               Onward and onward, with accelerated pace, they scoured the level plain, until the waters of a river were seen in the distance, through the bushes that lined its margin. They approached it, they halted at its side, and waited for the pedestrians to come up. Two long canoes lay concealed among the shrubbery, drawn half out of the water, and there seemed to be a debate whether the prisoner should go in one of these, or continue her present mode of travel. Her immediate attendant appeared to be in some authority, or perhaps claimed the custody of her, if not the ownership, on account of having first seized her and her steed. He seemed, she thought, to urge that if she was to proceed in the canoe, he was to accompany her, and relinquish his horse to one of the footmen. 
               There was evidently a difference of opinion, if not a quarrel; and in the heat of controversy, her captor used several rapid and earnest gesticulations, and in doing so, he dropped the bridle of her horse upon his knee. 
               A thought, a hope, flashed like inspiration through her mind. The savages were all around her," chiefly, behind, and the pedestrians, who had not yet arrived, were about sixty rods in the rear. Her heart beat high-her frame shook-with excitement-she cast her eyes to Heaven-she watched the bridle, and pulled it tightly, with a familiar word to her steed. 
               With a bound, like the leap of a tiger, Brutus cleared the throng, striking his hoofs into his captor's horse as he did so. Elsie repeated her cry of encouragement to her steed, and clung firmly to her seat, while the landscape seemed to dart backwards past her, and a roar of wrath came to her ears, mingled with the report of muskets and the hissing of balls through the air. 
               Onward like thought she went, but now she heard the sound of trampling hoofs behind her, that seemed to come as fast and furiously, and threatened her immediate recapture. Again she urged the noble hunter forward, but there was no longer need of voice or whip for him. He beard the sound of pursuit; his graceful ears turned backwards to catch the tidings, and then, like the shadow of a swift cloud, he flitted across the landscape. If ever brute comprehended and reasoned, he did so, and Elsie fully believed that he knew her great danger, and was trying to save her. His long, antelope-Hike bounds were made with an ease and uniformity of motion which, while clearing prodigious spaces at every leap, scarcely disturbed her in her seat. 
               But, alas! every step was bearing her farther from home, farther from all trace of civilization, and deeper into the vast wilderness, where she knew she might at any moment meet with other roving bands of Indians no more merciful than those she had escaped. She could not turn towards home, for between it and her were her pursuers, while on one side was the river, and on the other a ridge of hills, covered with woods, which her imagination peopled thickly with ferocious savages. She was thus confined, as it were, to a narrow, glen, along which she was being driven like a hare before the hounds. 
               Onward and forward she went, seemingly with still accelerated motion, more than once starting a herd of browsing deer, and passing them at their utmost flight. Whatever wonders in speed Brutus had before accomplished, he now surpassed them all, and without the appearance of great effort or fatigue. There were no signs of giving out. She looked frequently behind her, and saw her pursuers at each time more remote, although they were urging their horses forward with shouts and blows. But their advantage consisted in driving her every moment farther from her home, while they were constantly approaching nearer to theirs. 
               Elsie became momentarily more and more sensible of this new danger. She saw there was no longer any difficulty in distancing her foes in a direct line, for soon the noise of their shouts ceased to reach her ears, and their figures grew less and less distinctly perceptible, until they had vanished altogether from view. She then checked her horse, and gave him several minutes' repose, while she reflected upon her situation, and more carefully surveyed the landscape in every direction. 
               She reasoned rapidly and well. To continue her present course was of all things most imprudent-to cross the river was dangerous, if not impracticable-and the only remaining resource was the hills on her left. True, the forests were more likely to be peopled than the plain, besides, as she knew, being alive with beasts of prey; but she resolved not to attempt to penetrate or cross them, but only to find a place of shelter and concealment while the enemy passed by. Her resolution being taken, she proceeded instantly to put it into execution. She approached the hill, ascended it, and entered the woods, where they were most dense and dark, and amid large trees, and thick, overhanging boughs, she dismounted and fastened her horse by the bridle to a sapling. 
               She dared to go no farther. The sun was not yet down, but night seemed to have settled upon the forests, and palpable gloom and horror to permeate all its recesses. An indefinable terror came upon her, greater if possible than any she had yet felt, and she clung close to her steed for companionship, resting her arm and head up-on his neck as upon that of a dear friend. From time to time she looked forth, but without discovering the enemy. Nearly half an hour elapsed, and the sun was on he horizon's edge, when they came in view, and then it was at a pace which seemed to indicate that they had abandoned the hope any immediate success. She supposed, correctly enough, that they calculated on her being in their power, caged, as it were, in hat narrow defile, and that sooner or later, she must fall into their lands, if she did not ere morning voluntarily seek that refuge from the wild beasts of the desert. 
               Slow and more slowly they came, and soon she surmised, from their frequent pauses by the river side, that they were waiting for the canoes to overtake them. Such proved to be the case, and soon afterwards the boats came in view; but while she was indulging the trembling hope of seeing them pass harmlessly by her, to her unspeakable alarm the whole, party prepared to encamp. They selected their ground for this purpose among some low bushes near the water's edge, at a distance of about a quarter of a mile from her place of concealment, and where it would be impossible for her to pass them unobserved, if the least vigilance was exercised in their camp, imposing upon her the necessity of passing the night in her exposed situation. 
               The horrors of her position for the next hour defy description. Standing beside her trembling steed, they heard together the-howl of the prowling wolves; and the cry of the distant catamount, which seemed at each repetition of its scream to be nearer than before. Occasionally the crackling of distant boughs proclaimed the passing of some wild animal, and Elsie fancied that she saw glaring eyeballs, at times, shining like baleful meteors, through the gloom. 
               The camp of the enemy, meantime, had been quiet. A single fire had been lighted for culinary purposes, and seemingly carefully shielded from distant observation. The savages ate and drank in silence, and all, with the exception of a single sentinel, either sat or lay down to repose. When the attack which has been described was made upon them, Elsie fully supposed the assailants were another party of savages; and, appalling as was this new horror, it was made more fearful by the apprehension that some of the vanquished party might, in their flight, resort to her own hiding-place. But as the contest proceeded, she began to reflect that, if her pursuers were vanquished or dislodged from their position, it might open the door for her escape. 
               She listened in agony to the dreadful din of the contest, which, brief as it was, seemed to her interminable. Shout upon shout went up, but so commingled were the sounds, that all for awhile seemed to her alike hideous and savage. But as she listened with ear acute, to catch the first signs of victory or flight, the Stentorian voice of the sailor came once alone and isolated to her ear, his very words ringing through the forest aisles, as he shouted- 
               "Give it to 'em, my hearties! Ahoy! boys, ahoy!" 
               Like lightning flashed the conviction on Elsie's mind that her friends were at hand, and, like lightning too, its effects were stunning and paralyzing to her frame. Voice, breath and consciousness seemed to depart from her, and when she revived, it was only to be agitated by the most tumultuous emotions, for the hope of rescue was mingled with the most painful fears for her father and brother, who she knew were engaged in that sanguinary battle. 
               But at length she knew, by the decreasing noise, that the conflict drew to an end, and then she heard the sound of horses galloping down the valley, and the trampling of men running in the same direction. Ah! with what immeasurable joy did her heart now leap! Her friends, she knew, had been victorious; for if they had fled, it would have been in the opposite direction. And now all her thoughts were how to reach them in safety, and relieve them from the terrible apprehension which they must feel in her behalf. She dared not ride Brutus down the declivity in the darkness, and after waiting until she thought the last fugitive enemy must certainly have passed by, she resolved to descend alone and seek the camp. 
               Clinging to the bushes, she clambered slowly down, and with much difficulty reached the open plain; then keeping near the base of the hill, she advanced slowly, and with the utmost caution, towards the encampment, fearful every moment that the sentinels might fire upon her, before she could make herself known to them. She was fortunately ignorant of the Chippewas being on duty, for she never would have dared to advance towards them, and indeed the risk was of the most imminent nature. 
               But she proceeded until she came directly opposite the most open part of the bushy tent of her friends, when with desperate energy she raised her voice to its highest pitch, and called upon her brother and her father. For one moment the words rang, in trembling tones, alone and shrilly upon the still night air, "Richard! Richard! Father! Father!"-but at the next there was an answering cry from many eager voices, and a rush of many people from the grove. 
               With uncertain step, they ran in every direction, but one light figure alone, guided by the sure instinct of a brother's heart, bounded, antelope-like, towards the hill. 
               "Elsie! Elsie!" he cried, in tones that trembled even more than his sister's voice-" where, Elsie? Where? Elsie, dear sister, where?" 
               "Richard! Richard!" 
               "Here, Elsie, here!" and at the next instant brother and sister were clasped in each other's arms. The resolute spirit which had so long sustained the noble-hearted girl seemed to give way now that there was no longer occasion for its exercise, and, for the first time during all her sufferings, she entirely swooned, and was borne in a state of perfect unconsciousness to the camp. 
               What joy, what ecstacy, what exultation reigned there, it is unnecessary to tell. How the midday sun seemed to gleam all at once upon their night of great gloom, and irradiate all hearts with its brilliancy. Soon resuscitated, Elsie, after repeatedly embracing her father and brother, briefly recounted to them the particulars of her escape, and begged that they might all there, beneath the starry canopy, return thanks to Heaven. In silence they knelt together, and silent were their grateful orisons, save when interrupted by sobs of joy. 
               Elsie had up to this time remained entirely ignorant of Mr. Niles' presence, and when Richard was now about to acquaint her with it, Melancthon begged that it might be deferred, and that no further explanations might retard their homeward journey. 
               "We have all heard enough that is new and strange and delightful for to-night," he said; "let every thing else be postponed until to-morrow." 
               His advice was taken. A man was at once despatched to bring Brutus from the forest, and as soon as he returned with the steed, the whole party set out for home. The captured horses were nearly sufficient in number to furnish every man with one who was before unsupplied, and there was therefore no impediment in the way of their speedy return. To the great astonishment of the few surviving Ojibways, they not only were not killed, but were provided with provisions sufficient for several days' support, during which they would be pretty certain either to be visited and relieved by some of their tribe, or to be able to reach them by means of their canoes, which remained in the river. 
               Soon after daylight on the ensuing morning, the heroic little army safely re-entered the quiet village of Pophamville, and the rescued Elsie was borne in triumph to her home, amid the shouts and acclamations of all who could shout or acclaim. 
             
             
               CHAPTER XXIII. 
               IT WAS not until late on that happy day that the principal actors in these exciting scenes were sufficiently recovered from their great fatigue to admit of further explanations, or of discussing either the past or the future. It was then that Elsie was first informed of the presence of Mr. Niles, and of the important part which he had acted in the late events, and ere she had scarcely time to express her great astonishment, or to recover from the strange and embarrassing thoughts to which this intelligence gave rise, Melancthon was fairly dragged into her presence by the happy Richard. 
               "This is your deliverer, Elsie!" he exclaimed-"this is the man who has done more than all the rest of us together for your rescue." 
               Elsie reached out her hand to her friend in silence. She could not speak, but her eyes filled with tears, which were eloquent of thanks. 
               "Your brother gives me far too much credit, I assure you, Miss Elsie," said Niles, laughing slightly, and trying to restore her to equanimity: "I really did very little. The true hero of the day was Granite Joe." 
               "I have gratitude enough for all," replied Elsie, smiling; "Mr. Niles will give me credit for a full appreciation of his noble conduct, although he sees fit to decry it himself." 
               "Right, Elsie; we will not allow him to transfer to a private, however brave, the merits which are chiefly due to the leader. Great as were the sailor's services, the battle would doubtless have been won without him; but without you, my friend, it is doubtful whether we should have seen the enemy. One word of discouragement from you at our first consultation last evening, would certainly have been fatal to our expedition, for, as I have since learned, many were then disposed to return." 
               "Well, well, settle it to suit yourselves," replied Melancthon; "it is not very material, as I presume none of us are to be gazetted." 
               The evening was passed in the animated conversation for which there was such abundant material. Elsie was obliged to repeat again and again all the minute particulars of her capture and escape, as well as of her varied emotions, and many anecdotes of personal adventures ventures were also related by members of the company. 
               When they separated, Richard remained for a long time alone, deeply absorbed in thought, and beset by strange conjectures. The train of exciting events which had just terminated, had left him no leisure for reflection upon the theme which now filled his mind. Who was this strange man, whose fortunes had become so suddenly blended with their own, and to whom they were all under such weighty obligations? Why had he followed them to the desert world, and when there, lavished his money and risked his life in their behalf? Above all, what was the nature of that secret understanding which seemed to exist on some points between him and Mr. Popham, and which had induced the latter so promptly to endorse the stranger's promise of five hundred guineas to his little army? These were questions which suggested themselves to Richard's mind, without finding a solution, and with them came the remembrance of Adonijah's singular generosity to himself and father, of his embarrassment and Mr. Niles' coolness and reserve towards him at their first meeting in Pophamville, and lastly the half-erased and inexplicable words in Melancthon's letter to himself. 
               Singly, as these circumstances had before been viewed, they were of little weight; but now, regarded in the aggregate, they seemed to point to some mystery which he believed must soon be developed. Nor was he mistaken. On the next morning, immediately after breakfast, Mr. Niles invited him to walk with him in the neighboring fields, intimating that he had something of importance to communicate with him, and as soon as they were quite alone, he began: 
               "The events which have so recently occurred, and the great distress they have occasioned you all, must naturally create apprehensions for the future, and render it unadvisable that you should longer reside here. But, before I counsel too freely, it may be proper that I should fully explain some matters pertaining to myself, over which there has long been so thin a veil of concealment, that I can scarcely believe you have not already penetrated it." 
               Richard replied in amazement that he had gussed nothing, and was entirely at a loss as to the meaning of his friend, the chief mystery of whose character, in his view, he said, was his many sacrifices and risks for people who had so little claim upon his kindness. 
               "Know then," continued Melancthon, taking Richard's hand, "that I am that once unfortunate man, that hypochondriac and misanthrope, of whom we conversed on shipboard, and of whom you have often heard-your mother's cousin. Born to great wealth, and educated to great selfishness, a sedentary and inactive life strengthened and increased all the natural infirmities both of my mind and body. I have been, in the midst of all my wealth, a miserable man; I was so eight months ago, when a good friend of your family informed me of your father's embarrassments, and of his intention to emigrate to America. The tidings which thus indirectly reached me were more effective, because I saw in your family independent and high-spirited people, who were willing to undergo any hardship rather than to ask pecuniary assistance from a relation who, although surfeited with wealth, had never tendered them aid. I resolved to assist you, and I at once drew a large check on my banker, for your benefit, but, on further reflection, I decided to adopt the singular, and I confess somewhat romantic, course which I have since pursued. I had long indulged a wish to see this country, and had fully determined at some time to visit it. The chance was too good to be lost. I resolved to come with you, and to become acquainted with you all, while I, myself, remained unknown. I resolved to aid you, whenever I could do so unsuspected by you, designing, when my farce was played out, to render that more permanent assistance which I at first had contemplated. This plan promised me amusement and many months' relief from my besetting misery-ennui. I remembered Elsie as a girl of exceeding loveliness, when at the age of fourteen she had visited Aunt Staunton, but I was not prepared to find, in her maturer charms, that surpassing fascination which I discovered on once more beholding her on shipboard, and which has ever since haunted my memory." 
               He hesitated, and slightly blushed, as he uttered these words, but he seemed resolved to tell his story through. 
               "In short," he concluded, smiling, "I liked you all, and I became daily more and more pleased with the little farce I was playing, but various events, which I could not control, prevented my carrying out my plans entirely in the way I had anticipated." 
               "Then Mr. Popham was but your almoner!" exclaimed Richard, whose great astonishment at these disclosures had scarcely allowed him utterance before; "and all his pretended generosity was unreal!" 
               "Most true, for it is proper you should know the whole story.-He is so far from a generous man, that he is not even just; he greatly deceived me, as he doubtless did you, by his representations in regard to his lands, and especially relative to their location, or I never should have consented to your accompanying him here. But I did not mean that your family should remain more than a few months in their western home, and therefore I was less particular in my inquiries. I knew him selfish, but I thought you would easily believe him otherwise, more especially as you had received in other quarters so many and such genuine proofs of American kindness." 
               These things and many more did Mr. Upton relate to his amazed friend, and after a long consultation, they retraced their steps homeward. 
               "How greatly will Elsie be surprised!" said Richard. 
               "On the contrary" replied Upton ton, "I believe that she has known me from the first hour of our meeting on board the Blazer." 
               "Is it possible?" 
               "I think so, but am not certain-if so, she has certainly shown great consideration and kindness in keeping my secret." 
               They went home, where, by Mr. Upton's express desire, Richard at once made him known to the whole family, in his true character; an announcement which created the most unbounded surprise with every one excepting Elsie, who, as had been conjectured, knew it all before. Nor was the pleasure of the Dillons less than their surprise, for they were delighted to find that the kind friend to whom they owed so much, was of their own kindred, and a man whom they had long been accustomed to regard with dislike. How all the supposed harsh traits of his character now suddenly disappeared, and all the mellow tints came out, like the changes seen in the dissolving views of the show-room. But this was not a change of appearance only. Upton had indeed undergone a transformation within the last few months, under the genial influences to which he had been exposed, something like those illusive ones which have been referred to. Latent emotions and sentiments had been developed in his heart, of the existence of which he had before been ignorant. True generosity, pure friendship, and ardent love-all these priceless treasured were his, and for all he was indebted to his new friends. Truly he had received more than he had given. 
               The remainder of this remarkable series of events may be best told in a few words. Mr. Upton at once frankly offered his hand to Elsie, who had already given him her heart, as unconsciously as she had won his own, and it need not be said he was not refused. Their engagement gave the liveliest pleasure to the whole family, with the exception of Belinda, who had entertained her own views of their guest's designs in following them to their western home, but she became reconciled to the arrangement, in view of the speedy release which it promised herself, in common with the whole family, from the horrors of the wilderness. 
               Mr. Upton promptly acquitted himself of his obligations to the members of his little army; by dividing among them the large reward which he had promised in case of success in their expedition. To Granite Joe he gave a far larger sum, and one which would insure him a competence for the remainder of his days. Mr. Dillon also presented to the sailor a valuable watch and rifle, together with a written testimonial of the valor and services which had merited so many rich donations. 
               But great as was Joseph's attachment to his English friends, it did not extend to a willingness to leave his native land forever with them. Had they remained here, he said, he would never have consented to leave them, but he chose now, after accompanying them to the seaboard, to go in search of some distant relations of his own, and spend the remainder of his life with them. This arrangement he carried into effect. 
               Mr. Popham, in remuneration for his military services, and in consideration of the great loss which his capital would sustain by the departure of the Dillons, was allowed to retain the liberal purchase price of their farm, which he had received from Mr. Upton, in New York, several months before, but the deed of which had never been accepted. There was also a considerable additional sum, which had been placed in his hands for the benefit of the immigrant family, for which, to his great delight, he was not called to account. He pronounced Mr. Upton a prince, and bestowed on the whole party a sort of patriarchal benediction when they departed. 
               Fortunately the travellers were not compelled to return by the tedious way by which they had come, having learned that an easier, though more circuitous and expensive route was open to them by the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, and one by which they could readily transport their now doubly prized steeds. They were within a day's ride of the former river, which they easily reached, and descending by steamboat to the Ohio, they there took another vessel to Pittsburg, whence an easy access was found to New York. There Mr. Upton was joined by his servant, whom he had left at Milwaukie with part of his baggage, and to whom he had written to return. 
               After a few weeks' sojourn in the metropolis, the whole party embarked for England, but not before Mr. Dillon had placed in the hands of Mr. Blythe, to be returned to the donors, the money which had been collected by Captain Stone for his benefit. A prosperous voyage brought them all, in due time, safely to their own country, where the Dillons found their own beloved home, not only vacant, but in all respects pre-pared for them, their benefactor having arranged every thing for this purpose, before he left New York, by correspondence with the attorney, Bray. 
               Mr. Upton spent a few days with the family of his future father-in-law, before proceeding to his own home, and the wedding was appointed for the ensuing winter holidays, when it was celebrated with great festivity. All were too happy then to admit of any but kind feelings mingling with their reminiscences, and, although their experience in the new world had been in many respects a sad one, it was not without its gleams of light. They had been robbed by their own countryman, and deceived by a speculator, but there had been very much of real kindness in the treatment which they had received in other quarters, of which they entertained the most grateful remembrance. In the plenitude of their benevolence, even Popham was pardoned as a naturally amiable man, less deceiving than self-deceived, and the very Ojibways did not want apologists. 
               It has been said that all were happy, but Richard's spirits were positively in a dangerous state of effervescence. He shone with mirth and sparkled with fun, and when his excitement became otherwise irrepressible, he would throw himself upon the petted Cassius, which was thenceforth his favorite horse, and taking a gallop of half a dozen miles, come back restored to a state of sanity. In after years he often longed to revisit the wilds of America, and renew the exciting sports which he had once so greatly enjoyed. But the love of home, and another love, to which his noble heart could not long be a stranger, has hitherto prevented his gratifying these wishes; but as he still lives, prosperous and happy, he may yet return to travel again the glens and glades of the glorious West, and to hunt bears, buffaloes, and Ojibway Indians.

            THE CABIN AND PARLOR. 
            BY J. THORNTON RANDOLPH. 
            18,000 COPIES SOLD IN TEN DAYS. 
            A BOOK FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. 
            COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME OF 336 PAGES; FULL OF BEATITIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS. 
            PRICE ONE DOLLAR A COPY IN CLOTH, GILT; OR FIFTY CENTS IN PAPER COVER. 
            Eighteen Thousand Copies of this celebrated work were sold by October 28th, 1852, which was only ten days after its first publication, at which time this advertisement was written, and the demand is increasing every day. The Press every where praise it as far, surpassing Mrs. Stowe's far-famed work of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Telegraphic despatches from all quarters of-the "UNION" are pouring in for it, and Printers, Steam Presses, Bookbinders, Packers, and all others are kept busy at it to supply the demand. Every body should read it. 
            "THB CABIN AND PARLOR," is a book for the whole country, and not for one section only. It is intended to allay, not excite, local jealousies. It is free from all bias of party. Every person who values the Constitution framed by Washington and his co-patriots, or loves "truth for truth's sake," should have a copy of this work. 
            The author is a gentleman who has travelled both North and South, so that his descriptions are both faithful and accurate; indeed, nearly every incident described in the volume, he has personally witnessed. The narrative, though thus substantially true, is as thrilling as the most engrossing novel. Never, perhaps, has a book so interesting in every respect, been offered to the American public. 
            The spirit of enlarged philanthropy which pervades the book, is not its least recommendation. The author is a true and wise friend of his race, and hot a quack in morals, as so many modern writers are. His religion is that of the Bible, and not mere varnished infidelity.
