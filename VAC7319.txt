TILE PRIZE ESSAY.

Well, good-bye, may the muses attend you, and-
yes, I might as well wish you success !" and with
this Gary Putnam dashed away to join his com-
panions,with all of whom he was much ofafavorite
This youth was now in his eighteenth year,
and through all his life he had seemed Fortune's
pet child. The son of a wealthy city Judge, in
his infancy and boyhood he had basked in the
sunshine of a delightful home, and the object of
a doting mother and sister's love;and his father's
pride, scarcely a wished for pleasure had been de-
nied him. Possessing fine mental powers by nature,
each day of his, life had served to foster within
his heart a self-superiority, and consequently a
depreciation of almost every one he might come
in contact with. Very early he learned to hold
all mental, as well as physical labor, in contempt.
Why should he not? all praised and petted him-
teachers held him up as an example, and -friends
called him a child of genius. Since he, without
an half hour's labor, would far excel those who
had toiled for long hours to accomplish the same
thing-could win praises and prizes till they had
no value. Where was the necessity of his doing
more ? Happily he possessed a good share of
heart-kindness-a great deal of good nature and
tact-so was not more a favorite at home than in
the country academy, where he was placed for a
thorough preparation for college. Before the first
six months came to an end, nearly every one,
teachers not excepted, paid court to this young
man's genius-perchance a small share of the
attention which was heaped upon him might have
been owing to his father's wealth. Be.that as it
may, his stay in this country school had been
very delightful to him-the two years had been
years of triumph, which would have filled almost
any young head with pride. Surely it was not
strange that he smiled half derisively at the idea
of the less fortunate, and, as he believed, less
gifted Richard Sumner entering the lists against
him in composition-the study of all others in
which he took pride in success. And now one
glance at young Sumner's past and present.
Like his school-fellow, he was an only son, the
object of the love and pride of his parents and
two younger sisters. But his father, a tolerable
thrifty farmer, had scraped together his little all
by dint of hard labor, and when his son first ex.
pressed adesire for a better education than could
be procured at their district school-which, after
he was ten years of age, he could attend for but
three months in the year, he having become far
too useful to be spared from the farm, save du-
ring the depth of winter-old Mr. Sumner thought
the boy a little out of his mind. It was, however,

talked over again and again by the two, some-
times Mrs. Sumner and her two daughters, Mary
and Janet, being present. Whenever they were,
the fond girls, though tooyoungto speak with dis-
cretion-had their little word in favor of their
brother's plans, and although Mrs. Sumner was
too exemplary a wife to take a position against
her husband, yet she could not help smiling upon
her children with pride, so willing as they were
to sacrifice to each other. These young sisters
proposing the yielding of some promised pleasure
that their brother should be gratified, and he as
firmly refusing to, accept such a sacrifice from
them. The end was, the father yielded to the
reasonings of his son, although he would persist
in pronouncing it all folly for a farmer's boy to
have a better education than could be acquired in
their own little district school house.
One year Richard should spend in the academy,
situated about a dozen miles from his home-but
this could not be an unbroken year. The first of
November-it would be his nineteenth birthday,
in prospect such a happy one-he was to com-
mence, to remain, save the week of holidays, six
months without interruption. Then he must
come home to help his father through with the
farm work until the following November, when
he should re-enter school to complete his year.
And that home-was it not a busy one ! Never
did mother's and sisters' fingers work more in-
dustriously or more willingly to prepare a darling
son and brother for his first going away from that
dear fireside ; and all their niceness and'industry
were necessary to make their Richard's home-
spun clothing passable among the more -highly
favored sons and daughters with whom he was
to mingle. He was a fine youth, and when Mrs.
Sumner and the girls saw him ready to take his
departure, in the simplicity of their loving hearts
they wondered if he would not be the pride of
the academy, as he was of their home. The
" good-byes'  were happy, smiling ones, for
economy required that the boy should board him-
self, so he would come home every week to re-
new his stock of provisions ; and every Saturday
afternoon it would be so delightful to have him
come as a visitor-better than having him all the
time, the girls said to their mother, in whose lov-
ing eyes the tears would glisten. Even the noble
hearted old father caught something of their en-
thusiasm, and rubbed his horny hands with a good
relish at the thought of the splendid times they
would have every Saturday night listening to all
Dick would have to tell them, and in their turn
relating all the haps and mishaps connected with
kitchen and barn yard.

This young man's entry into what must of
course be so new to him, was attended by many
trials. Diffident to a painful degree-for many
days he shrank and trembled at the very sound
of his own voice. There were a few, as there
ever are in such a country seminary, who made a
jest of his embarrassment, yet nearly all had for
him a kind werd, and very soon he gained courage
to show what he really was, and before a month
passed he found a footing among schoolfellows
and teachers not at all despicable. His educa-
tion, though home gained, had not been neglected,
and by his untiring industry this farmer boy kept
his ?lace nobly with those who had spent months
where he had days in the school. And the gay,
dashing Gary Putnam, who thought Dick Sum-
ner one of the finest fellows he had ever seen, was
filled with delight at his unequalled success,
though he did shrug his shoulders in a half com-
miserating way at such untiring labor.
Sumner's first six months had come very near
to its close-it had been a delightful time, and
the last three weeks, which were spent in re-
viewing everything in preparation for the exhibi-
tion which was to terminate the winter and
spring term, gave this youth little time for pleas-
ure or sleep, so anxious was he for the result,
and so determined that his parents and sisters,
who were to be there, should be made happy by.
seeing him hold a fair position among the stu-
dents. He belonged to the first rhetoric class, in
which the Professor took great pride. To the
member who should write the best essay there
was to be given a prize, yet to make a trial for it
was not compulsory, but rested with the choice
of the pupils. Gary Putnam prided himself
more upon his position in this class than in any
other, and so successful had he been in winning
the prize each term, it had frightened nearly all
his fellows from the field as competitors ; but
Richard Sumner resolved that this time he
should have a determined rival, if not a success-
ful one, yet crowded as he found every moment,
sometimes it had seemed almost impossible to de-
vote one hour to what should have had aleast a
whole day.
A fortnight before the close of the term, when
at home to make his weekly visit, he was telling
his sister Mary-who was now fifteen-of his
fear that he should have no time to spend in this
little strife. Sister-like she was confident it but
required her darling brother's best effort to make
sure of the victory, for had he not already re-
ceived the highest praise-and deservedly too-
for the beautiful things he had written. That his
friend, young Putnam, whose praises he was nev-

er tired of sounding, could do well she was ready
to admit, but not better than her brother, and her
proposal that they should all forego the pleasure
of their visit for two weeks to come, was seized
upon by Richard with great eagerness.
"After that we'll have you every day for six
months, brother Dick, so we shall -none of
us mind it so very much-poor little Janet will
take on the worst, for you have no idea how she
misses you; all the week she counts the days to
Saturday, then as as soon as that day, which is a
v ary bright day to all of us, comes, she counts the
hours till your time of arriving ; but don't yield
to the little rogue, for we shall be so proud to
hear your name called out on that night. I am
sure we shall be well paid for not seeing you all
these two weeks."
And so it was decided, not, however, without
some opposition from the younger sister, as well
as the father, that Saturday of the two following
weeks should be spent by this ambitious youth in
making himself ready, for what, to all of them,
was a very great event.
By nearly all the students Saturday was passed
as a holyday, and when young Putnam had heard
that his friend, sumner, had not gone home, as
was his custom, lie determined to secure him as
one of a party he was getting up for a day in the
woods. But as has been seen, Dick Sumner had
something more important on hand, and his young
friend was not altogether satisfied at discovering
the same. He was very partial to him, but no,
he could not feel willing to yield the pamhn to him
in this department.
"If he had chosen to rival me in anything elfn,"
soliloquised Putnam, as he went out, "I would mot
mind it-I wouldn't try very hard, for I like his
spirit, but in this 1 must keep imy place " but lie
had no thought of the wound lie had given that
friend's spirit by the tone of superiority he had
assumed. Habit had taught him to consider this
his right, and nearly all acknowledged it so, by
countenancing what, in another one, they would
have set down to impertinence.
Sumner and Putnam    were the same good
friends as ever after this slight difference, anil
may be the former would have felt a small sitisfe-
tion, could he have known his confident rival
had taken another reading of his own essay -
making  some changes and amendments. At
length the examination, which was to last two
days, commenced, and as usual, progressed finely.
This was not only an academy for young men, but
for young ladies as well, and in that examina-
tion there was manifest the spirit and vigor
which is found inl no inistitutioni devoted to

either sex exclusively. Not until the last even-
ing were to come the reading and speaking,
the evening of the closing exhibition, and by
all this was looked forward to with great
anxiety, for not until then would they know who
was counted first in any of the classes, nor who
was successful in the prize essay-and never had
Gary Putnam felt as much excitement in such
matter as he did now. As to Richard Sumner,
everything was new and exciting, to everything
he gave a share-of thought and anxiety, and not
after his essay had gone out of his hands, until on
this last evening, as he sat in his place among
his fellows, and occasionally caught a glimpse of
one or more of the eager fond faces of his own
family, did he feel any peculiar heart-throbbings
for the coming declaration as to who was the
winner. They would feel it so much if he had
failed in this-yet he had scarcely a hope of any-
thing else. The kind-Sumner almost fancied
congratulatory-smile of the preceptress, who,
with the professor, and one other teacher, were
the judges in all the matters-thepeculiar smile
of this lady-like matronly woman, as she passed
him to take her place among the teachers, made
the young man's heart bound with hope ; "She
would not have smiled in that way upon me was
I the loser in what I have striven for with all may
strength, she is so kind;"lhe said this mentally,but a
moment after, the thought " she is accustomed to
such things, and could have no idea how I, a fool
ish boy, would interpret a kindly glance-no, I
wont flatter myself;" and it would have been
well for him, had he prevailed upon his ex-
pectant heart to yield up all his hopes, for a
moment after, the reader coming upon the stage,
the prize essay was announced, and the first word
consigned all his cherished hopes to the grave.'It
was very hard to endure, yet the young marn
was far toy proud to allow those around him to
see his disappointment, and bravely he returned
a congratulatory smile for the triumphant one his
friend Putnam threw upon him. Richard Sum-
ner held his teachers in too high a respect to think
of anything like injustice, yet he knew his partial
dear ones could not see this in the same light he
could, and try as he would, he could not gain cour-
age to glance at those sadly disappointed faces.
He knew their expectations had been very high,
and he feared his sister Mary would consider his
success in everything else as nothing, that he had
failed in this. While these thoughts were flitting
through his mind, he was listening to the reading
of his rival's production, And before it was half
done, he was more than satisfied that the choiceI
had been made with justice-it was a brilliant

composition, displaying much genius, and he felt
no jealousy when Gary Putnam was:announced
the recipient of the prize.
" But," the Professor went on to say, " this is
not the only; rival essay which deserves a hear-
ing-there is another scarcely inferior-not in-
ferior in excellency-but the writer has failed to
round his sentences as perfectly as in that just
read: as this is a thing to be acquired by prac-
tice'only, it could hardly be pronounced a fault;
yet it must have its consideration, and it has turn-
ed the scales in favor of Mr. Patnam, although one
of the three, whose difficult task it was to decide,
still persists in holding to the rejected, but most
praiseworthy essay as the one deserving the prize.
All shall hear it," he said, and taking his seat,
the reader came forward, and commenced in a
clear tone-yes, he was not mistaken-these were
his own carefully studied reflections.
Richard's disappointment had not been half as
difficult to endure as was this joy; for a few mo-
nients ho heard nothing save the hum of the read-
er's voice, saw nothing but that radiant face-
his sister Mary's face. His parents and little
Janet might still be in doubt, they had not lost all
of their expression of disappointment, though now
there was mingled with it much of hope, but his
eldest sister, extacy beamed from every feature.
That of itself would have rewarded the fond
brother for nights of toil and many days of pleas-
ure sacrificed to study. In the midst of his be-
wilderment he heard his own name called out,
and immediately followed such a clapping of
hands and stamping of feet as quite recalled his
wandering senses.
When order was partially restored the Profes-
sor called upon Gary Putnam to come forward and
receive his well earned prize; but before the
words had escaped his lips there arose such a tu-
mult among the audience-such a renewed clap.
ping of hands and calling for Richard Sumner ; in
a moment the students caught the enthusiasm,
and " Dick Sumner, Dick Sumner, too," was
echoed by a hundred voices, and the good, warm-
hearted Professor finding there was but one way
of quelling the tumult, left the stage, and a mo-
ment after returned followed by the rival friends,
Sumner and Putnam,arm in arm. Their appear-
ance called for renewed cheers, and when order
was once more restored, with a brief preamble
the good Professor made a presentation of the
prize-a beautifully bound volume ofShakspeare-
to the triumphant Putnam. He feared another
interruption before he should bethrough, so made
all possible haste ; but every voice was silent, no

a few drops, and found them so delicious; but
it could not be. He must be satisfied, for he was
confident his father had done all for him he could
afford, and he would show him that-he knew how
to be grateful. With a right good will he bade
adieu to his teachers and fellow-students, and re-
solved to leave all regrets behind him. It was
not his fortune to have such coveted advantages
as many he had come to know, during his year in
school, but he felt he had richer blessings, per-
haps, than they in that plain old farm-house, his
home, and he returned to them with a loving,
thankful heart.
This time, the termclosed on Friday night, and
the following Monday morning Dick Sumner ap-
peared in his rough farming garb, ready to do
battle with the spring's work, which was already
waiting to be attacked by his young strong arms.
That night the good old farmer whispered to his
smiling wife that their boy was made of the right
stuff ; "he can't be puffed up or spilt by all the
larnin' in the land ;" and when, in the following
fall, his manly son procured a situation as teach-
er of a school, and was to receive the almost fabu-
lous sum of twenty dollars a month, board and
wsAshing included, and his school to continue five
months, was not the father proud enough?
" Ah, my boy, we'll be thinkin' 'bout a new
houie one of these days," he exclaimed, carefully
reckoning up what amount of money Dick would
be the possessor of in the Spring; "Mother says
this old un is gettin' purty rickety, and so it is,
I 'spose, but it's somethin like oursel's; but, nev-
er mind, you and the gals is young and strong, and
so I ortn't to be thinkin' 'bout another and me."
As to the son, he entered heart and soul into
this plan for a new house, for, as his honest
father had said, the old one was getting rather
rickety, and he longed to see his patient, selfsac-
rificing mother surrounded by more comforts and
conveniences while she was still young enough to
enjoy them. As to his father, he always had a
warm, comfortable corner when he came home
from his work, and he could not understand what
nice-care and management were necessary to keep
that one room, which must serve as a kitchen and
parlor, so tidy, cheery, and rest-inviting. He
only knew it was so, and when he saw his pa-
tient-faced wife looking tired it quite puzzled
him, so nice and comfortable as she must be in-
doors all day long. Good old man! warmth and
rest had become more desirable to him than any-
thing else. But his son saw everything in a dif-
ferent light; young and strong, and hopeful, too,
he looked to working out a future, but in the

meantime his dear ones must be made comforta-
ble, and hisfirst earnings, swelled by what could
be cleared from their small farm, should be ex-
pended in building a new house ; then his sisters
must be thought of, for he had determined their
natural taste for books should be better gratified
than it could be at their district school, though
with his help they were for the present going on
finely.
Richard Sumner was most fortunate in pro-
curing the place he did as teacher. The people
were such as were ready to be pleased by one
who entered with a whole soul into the teaching
of their children, and before he left them, to the
delight of all his pupils and satisfaction of the
parents-he was re-engaged for the following,
winter at twenty-two dollar a month. With
his hundred dollars in his pocket, which, to ex-
press their more than satisfaction, the trustees
-contrary to custom-got ready for him the day
his school should close, he returned to his father's
home proud and happy. Why should he not be
happy ! in one year he had earned enough to re-
pay his father three-fold for what his father had
expended for him that extra year at the academy.
He had no thought of keeping back any portion
of it for little extravagances in clothing-for a
time his mother and sisters must attend ; to his
wardrobe, as they had ever done. Until he saw
them established in a new home he would not
aspire to any thing higher than comfortable home-
spun.
When the crops were disposed of the follow-
ing fall, their saved-up sum was swelled to two
hundred and fifty dollars. The coming winter's
earnings would make it three hundred and sixty ;
the old farmer rubbed his hands with glee.
"A new house for mother and the girls in two
years, my boy-five hundred dollars '11 dew the
thing right purty-good 'nough for queens, and
they is queens too, ain't they ; Mary's a plaguy
purty gal, jist like mother many a year ago, and
Nettie, the little weazel, ain't a pin ahind her;
childern is a great comfort, Dick-a real solid
comfort, my boy ! Well, it will be plaguy nice,
though, arter all, I kinder like old quarters, but
I wont be too selfish, I can't 'bide self-consate,
and young folks is young folks, and must have
change."
Richard's winter quarters were full twenty
miles from his father's home, so the Saturday
morning previous to the Monday which was to
commence his labors, the family were astir long
before day, for Mr. Sumner was to take his boy to
the substantial farmer's house where he was to
make it his home, and the utmost expedition

would be required to enable the old man to re-
turn by bed-time, for to stay away from his home
all night he often declared went aging his natur.
Never had Mary felt it so hard to be separated
from this dear elder brother as now; she knew it
was best, she felt it must be so, but that made it
no easier to endure. If they could but have him
as they had during his year in the academy, every
Saturday night it would make the separation
much more endurable ; but to gratify some
two or three time-saving fathers and mothers
Richard had consented to forego the Saturday
afternoon's rest, keeping each week out to the
utmost limit till five o'clock Saturday evening,
and even then hev as not allowed to feel his
time his own, nearly all joining in the opinion
that their sool master belonged to them is much
Sabbath as any other day, and he wondered him-
self how they got on without him in the singing
at the meetings which were held in the school-
house every Sabbath, for when he was there, he
and his pupils made up the choir, save now
and then a devotional old brother or sister,
whom the spirit of piety moved to strike in and
do their very best to make the young folks strike
Out. So to gratify both parents and pupils Rich-
ard decided on making but one visit to his home
during the winter.
"You must help Nettie on with her studies,
Mary ; and you get on as well as you can alone,
saving everything you don't understand till I
come for that grand visit. It won't be so very
long, if you are busy all the time, and I know
you will be as busy as a bee-there, there, don't
cry Mary, I want to remember your face bright
and happy."
This was the noble boy's encouraging good-bye
o his oldest sister, who was more his companion
than any one else. To her he came with all his
hopes and anticipations, as well as with all his
difficulties and dis, ouragements ; they were in
truth to each other all that brother and sister
could be. None of those quarrelings and wrang-
liugs which ofttimes spring up from intercourse
with the world, had this little family ever known.
To think of each other seemed withal the most
natural thing in life, and now the eldest daughter
pressed back her tears, that by her cheerfulness
she might make the parting less painful to all the
rest: her hopes and ambitions were very high for
this brother, and well she knew how necessary
was separation, for how could he accomplish all
his talked of plans staying with thetm in their little
farm home. As to the father, he pronounced
them all a set of chicken-hearted babies, to cry
when Dick was sech a plaguy smart boy, able to

am sech lots o' money. But when the tender
mother and her two girls were left to themselves
they had a good cry together, and then their
tears were chased away by hopeful thoughts.
When the practical old farmer returned home
in the evening, and found their faces all beaming
with smiles, he pronounced them the most sen-
sible set of women folks he'd ever seen.
"He'll make a fortin, that boy of ourn one o'
these days ; it would a' did your heart good, moth-
er, to a' seen the way they received himjest
like he was a minister, or some other great man
by jings, didn't I feel proud and no mistake ! then
the way he interduced me to all on 'em-it was
jest like Dick and no body else ; one 'Id think
he'd been born a king, by his manners, and yet
there ain't tde first grain of stick-up in him."
As to mother and the girls, they fully agreed
with the enthusiastic father, yet in spite of all
her efforts to keep them back, the tears-which
were such a mystery to the husband-were
silently chasing each other down the wrinkled
cheeks of Mrs. Sumner. After a few days they
all became accustomed to having the absent one
away, and then they all gathered around the
large crackling fire in the kitchen, peaceful and
happy, after a hard day's work; the mother al
ways busy with her knitting or mending-Mary
stitching away industriously upon some progress-
ing garment, for she was now the only seamstress
the family required, while just at her elbow the
petted Nettie, who was seven years younger than
herself, had her place with arithmetic and slate
working her way so hard to get on in a way which
would astound brother Dick, when he should
come home for his mid-winter's visit. Then the
old farmer-who by wife and daughters was con-
sidered first and most important on all occasions,
occupied his cushioned chair, which ever held its
place in the brightest corner-his stockened feet
outstretched, his head laid back in the very atti-
tude of contentment at the glowing warmth which
was shining upon him. Sometimes he listened to,
or perhaps joined in the conversation between
his wife and oldest daughter, then he would close
his eyes for a moment's nap. They did, indeed,
present such a picture of humble happiness as
many a business wearied man, or fashion-slaved
woman might have envied.
It was something in this way that Richard ever
remembered the little circle at home during the
many months he was away from them, for he
found very few families so quiet and loving, with
whom the world had intermeddled in so small a
degree as had it with his own. From his inmnost
heart this youth prayed that it might never he

otherwise-that his pure-minded sisters would
ever have a little circle where their hearts should
centre their woman's love-for which life itself
would not be too great a sacrifice. The little he
had seen outside that home-hearth had convinced
him, that in its refining influence, no education,
however finished or elegant, could atone for the
absence of the teaching and training given by a
pure womanly nature, which, in his partiality, the
sen saw developed in all its perfections in his
own darling mother. So, amidst daily school la-
bors, evening studies, and a continual making of
himself useful, the first ten weeks went away.
Then the time came for his home visit, and never
was visitor greeted with fonder hisses, or more
hearty words of welcome.
But three days' stay had been granted him, and,
before he was conscious of it, they were gone;
yet it was astonishing how much.had been done
in that time. Mary had been helped up in all her
difficulties, and the brother was delighted to see
how finely she was getting on. Nettie had gone
through with an entire reviewing, and was more
than satisfied with the praises Dick heaped upon,
not only herself, but also her teacher. All the
cattle, sheep and horses, had passed before him
in their turn, and been pronounced in excellent
order; indeed, nothing had been forgotten, and
yet Richard went back to his labors with a feel-
ing of reluctance,
He feared his mother was not well-in her face
there was an expression of unusual care ; -he had
all the time felt it, but to his anxious inquiries
she had answered with a coaxing smile, that was
all. In his father, too, usually so quiet, he had
noticed a look of uneasiness. When his eyes
rested upon the mother's face, though when the
boy ventured to question- him upon the subject,
the old man had declared with great earnestness,
he had never in his life seen mother better; but
this could not wholly satisfy Richard, and he re-

however, his apprehensions became quieted by
one of his father's neighbors calling at his school
house to tell him they were all doing finely at
home. This friend had called at the old farm
house that very morning, knowing he should pass
that way, and thinking Richard might like to
hear; he had seen and talked with each member,
and pronounced them all looking unusually well
and in such good spirits-this was very satisfac-
tory, and once more this ambitious youth gave
himself up heart and soul to his labor.

CHAPTER SECOND.
"Droop not, tho' shame, sin and anguish are round thee,
Bravely fling off the eold chain that hath bound thee,
Look to yon pure Heaven, sailing beyond thee,
Rest not content in the darkness-a clod !
Work--.for some good-be it ever so siowiy,
Cherish some flower, be it ever so lowly;
Labor I all labor is noble and holy,
Let thy great deeds be thy prayer to thy God."-[Osgood.-
Time sped very swiftly away, until it wanted
but one week of the close of his five ionths, and
Richard began to feel regrets mingled with his
eagerness for the last day, for the tie between
teacher and pupil had become very strong.
A re-engagement for another winter was
talked of, but .the trustees hesitated about in-
creasing the wages, they having gone already
higher than had ever before been paid ; the young
man felt he was now competent to undertake a
much larger school, and was very near declining
the renewal of the engagement on any grounds-,
when circumstances occurred to hasten this de-
cision.
On Monday afternoon of thelast week, just as
the scholars had been dismissed for the day, the
teacher was startled bythe entrance of his father;
but one glance was needed to show the son there
was something very unusual weighing upon the
old man's mind ; his face was very sober, and
when he grasped the outstretched hand of his boy,
and answered that he was well to the affection-
ate "How do you do, father ?" there came no
smile to relax those sad, stern features, and the
voice was very dry and painfully husky. With
anxious hesitation Richard enquired after his
mother and the girls.
Well, well, toy boy, 'taint them that's the
matter !" answered the father in an excited man-
iner, and then laying his hand upon his son's should.
der, he went on in such a pleading tone, " Don't
blame me, Dick ; promise me you won't blame
me-won't call me an old fool, though I know
I've been one-yet I could never stand that--to
have my children turn agin me."
The son did his best to sooth the father, and
now with tolerable heart too, since he knew, what-
ever had happened, his mother and sisters were
well. After a little while the broken old man
commenced his sad story-and sad enough it was
too-yet he had no need to fear censures from his
son, judging from the looks of sympathy which
beaned upon the old man's face, as he went on
with his humiliating confession, of how in his
desire to grow suddenly rich, as had many of his
acquaintances in the neighboring village, he had
embarked in the raging wheat speculation, not
only risking their snug little sum of two hundred
and fifty dollars, bat in the firm beliet that he

could make double that amount, he had mortgag-
ed the dear old home, to raise an additional five
hundred. This had been expended in buying
wheat, double the amount it would pay for, the
same sworn friend-in truth one of the most
shrewd of grasping speculators, who had advanc-
ed hin the money on the mortgage-going his
security for the payment of the other half, as
soon as the old farmer should in his-turn sell ; but
to make himself safe, in case of accident, he said
he fixed a claim upon the same wheat to the
amount for which he was security.
This had been in early winter, day followed
upon day, not a cent more had-been offered in the
market than Mr. Sumner had given; his friends
assured him there was nothing to fear, it certain-
ly must come sip soon, so the simple hearted old
man was content to wait, as it was evident the
longer he waited, the greater would be the rise;
so said his advisers, and thel were experienced
men. But week had followed upon week, and
month upon month, and so far from the market
price increasing, each day it grew less and less,
until his friend Mr. Rich advised him to sell
without- an other d ay's delay. This to the old
man seemed impossible, and so he told his ad-
viser ; now he would not receive a farthing more
than half of what he had agreed to pay, and this
last was the friend's reason for not only insisting
upon a sale, but enforcing it, if there was any fur-
ther hesitation; and to his dismay poor Mr. Sumner
found he possessed the power, for the time which
had been given the old man to dispose of the
thousand bushels of wheat-which was the
amount he had purchased-had already expired.
"And to-morrow it goes my boy, and. every
cent 'll go into the pocket of John Rich-he is a
villain, I know it now, and I was a fool-but
that don't make it no easier to bear. Oh ! Dick
it's hard-plaguy hard-poor mother, she looks
near heart broke, but the gals try to cheer her,
though I can't see any cheer about it !" and the
old man buried his face in his hands and fairly
8 obbed aloud.
his son could not at first believe all was as bad
as was represented, but the father once more
composed, told that he had sought the best legal
advice their town afforded, and had been assured
there was no power in law to reach such a trans-
action-to let the suit go on, he could in truth
lose but the seven hundred and fifty dollars.
"But the seven hundred and fifty dollars, he
said, my boy, as though that wasn't enough to ruin
us! to sech as him it may be nothing, but to an
old non like mie, broke down by hard work-it's
too much-I'm sure it'll putty nigh kill me, and

It was very doubtful about their being able to
borrow a sum, to them so very large, on the teen-
rity they had to offer, and for the time they nut
ask for paying it, and the young man felt it would
be hardly the best thing to do if they could. lis
father's working days had past, and if the farm
was kept with its present incunmbrance, se en
months in the year if not more he must himself
be there, and then the help they should be com-
pelled to hire, would eat up all their profits ; so
their only hope of treeing themselves from debt
must rest in the winter's labors. Then there was
his mother to think of; though much younger than
his father, she bad worked too hard all her life,
to be forced to it anew, when she began to feel
the need of rest; and what was there for the girls
but a life of drudgery, if they remained on the
old debt incumubered place. If he could but get
a situation in some large village school, where he
would be employed simmer as well as winter,
and could have the family in a snug little home,
where he could board with them, Richard felt it

my boy, and I've ruined you all," and again the
old man broke down,
Richard tried to comfort his father, and indeed
it was a comfort that he was so kind, that lie ut-
tered no word of reproach ; he had not dared
hope it would be so though the mother had tried
to persuade her poor husband that their son could
act in no other way than kindly. Mr. Sunnier
went with Richard to his boarding place, for it
was too late for him to think of returning home
that night, and in a desponding way the old maia
said:
" It's of no account now, I might as well get
used to stayin' away, for the old place'11 have to
go and afore long too"-and after talking it over
during nearly the whole night the son was con-
vinced the father was right.
Their whole farm fell a little short of fifty
acres, and although they had good barns, the boise
was very poor, so the price for which it would
sell under the most favorable circumstances would
not be more than twice the amount for which it
had been mortgaged. The man who had a cimm
upon it would show no mercy, and the time was
drawing very near when he would have the pow-
er of foreclosing the mortgage, if the borrowed
money was not paid; for Mr. Sumner had given
his note payable in four months.

favorite time of talking over their plans, and now
the young man had just finished telling his com-
panion what he must be, doing. He had ended
by saying:
"Mr. Marston is very kind to let us stay here,
yet I couldn't think of accepting his kindness
any longer than necessary. Harry is at the bot-
tom of it, Mary, and although I like it in him, I
don't want you should be compelled to feel under
any such obligation, I must get a school, that
is the best thing for us, and in some village, too."
It was in reply to this, that the blushing girl had
asked her brother if he remembered his friend,
who, excepting the night of the exhibition, he
had never seen, but his answer told that he had
not forgotten.
"Yes, Mary, I do remember him, and now I
believe you are thinking of the same thing I have
been thinking of these good many days. To go
to Marshall, to try my luck in getting a school.
Father and mother will think it very far, but it
wont make much difference; it can't be more than
thirty-five or forty miles, and I do believe Judge
Fullerton would use his influence to get me the
school there."
That evening in thelold kitchen, the matter
was discussed thoroughly, and the result was the
next day was fixed upon for Dick to start for
Marshall. Two days passed and the family bore
the suspense with exemplary patience, but the
third day found them, from the old father to the,
child Nettie, excited and restless ; Richard had
told them they should allow him three days, yet
they all firmly expected him the evening of the
second, and when he did not come, parents grew
troubled and Nettie grew fretful, while Mary did
her best to reassure and sooth till three. Dear,
hopeful girl, her faith in her brother was of itself
almost sufficient to secure him success. Before
the forenoon of the third day had half gone, Net-
tie had been on the topmost rail of the fence not

j

less than half-a-dozen times to gain a longer sight
of the way by which they expected their traveler,
and each time as she jumped down, her declara
tion had become more emphatic that he was
never coming and there was no use in look-
ing for him. But he did come in spite of the im-
pulsive child's declaration to the contrary, and
to her chagrin from the opposite direction fromiii
the one she expected, and which she had watched
since dinner from her eyry in the topmost branch
of the highest pear tree which commanded the r oad
and long before she could scramble to the ground
the others had welcomed him in their own warm
way. The horse must first be tiken care of be-
fore the eager ones heard the result' if their
Richard's expedition ; so his mother and sist-rs
flew around to get something upon the table, ter
the poor boy must be nearly fitmished, they all
thought. When he came in, however, he bad
them leave the lunch, and sit down every one of
them, for he had much to tell; besides, he wasn't
hungry, having taken dinner about one o'clock.
And it was a long story he had to tell the little
circle who gathered around him. Just a little
in front of his boy, and so close that his hand
rested upon his knee, sat the old fa ther, his face
bearing the marks of care, and his 'yes turned
upon that manly son as his only hope; and then
near her husband sat the loving wife and mot her,
while upon the other side of the narra tir were
the two sisters, and never did speaker have bet-
ter listeners.
le arrived at Marshall the afternoon of the
day he left home, and enquiring for Judge Ful-
lerton's office of the landlord where he put up
his horse, he made his way to it without delay.
At first the kind-faced mann seemed to have for-
gotten him, but when his visitor told his ane he
grasped his hand more cordially than.the young
man had even hoped.
"Remember you, indeed I do, my son. I was
a farmer's boy, Mr. Sumner; I struggled through
many difficulties to gain my education, and that
little scene in the academy where I first saw you
came - right home to my heart: for an hour or
so I was living my academy days over again ; sit
down now, for I want to hear all about how you
have been going on,"
And so Richard had told this whole-hearted
man how the three years had passed, and finally
closed by revealing the object of his visit; and to
his satisfaction Judge Fullerton told him he was
almost sure he could secure the village school for
him the following fall-but at the same time he
said he ought to be doing something where his
powers of mind would be brought more into ac-

tion, and which would promise a better future.
Teaching was wearing mentally and physically,
and too often a most thankless as well as slavish
life ; and then the remuneration was not what it
ought to be.
" But we will talk more of this to-night, for you
will go home with me, and possibly we may strike
out a path for you in the future, which you will
think it better to follow than teaching."
That evening Judge Fullerton proposed to
Richard Sumner the commencing of the study of
law in his office. The young man told him how
impossible such a thing would be, much as he
might wish it. He must think of immediate ne-
cessities, which could only be met by his enter-
ing a remunerative occupation.
" I understand," had been the answer to this,
" of course I must understand this; yet is it not
possible for you to get on with what you might
earn as clerk? For the first year this might be
little more than enough to pay your board, we
will say three dollars a week, though if you are
a pretty rapid penman, and not afraid of early as
well as tolerably late hours, I think you could
bring it up to five or six dollars after a little time;
for you see, my son, this writing is a part of your
study, and if twelve hours are spent in the office,
six will be as much as you should spend in read-
ing, so six will be left for copying; in that time I
used to earn a dollar, but it was upon the very
nicest work-in truth as confidential clerk. You
are a farmer's boy, Sumner, you have been
brought up with economical, industrious, and
strictly honest habits, you are ambitious, and
have perseverance and strength to support your
ambition, why should you not take the place in
my office, if, as you tell me, your desire has been
to enter this profession. By a severe illness I
was two months ago robbed of my reliable clerk,
I have not been able to fill the place to my satis
faction, if you feel inclined to try such a labo-
rious course-for you will have to labor if you
would succeed-the place is open to you to make
a trial: If you come immediately, which I should
wish you to do, you will have learned before fall
whether you can venture to go on; if you cannot
I will promise to do my best to procure the school
for you ; now you see, I am offering you nothing
but a chance to work your way, but if you do as
well as I hope of a farmer's son, it will prov e a
mutually advantageous undertaking. Now tell
me frankly, how does this look to you, Mr. Sum
nor ?"
" It looks, sir, as though I would enter it heart
and soul, so far as the labor is to be considered,
but I must first see how much it will cost our

famiy to live here, for it won't do for me to un-
dertake anything that will be running us in debt.
Neither of my parents could endure such a thing,
nor could I; and to begin with, what will we be
compelled to pay for rent; a small house, but
comfortable, Judge Fullerton?"
" I have a cottage a half mile from the office
which will be vacated next week; it has two
very comfortable sleeping rooms, a small parlor,
kitchen and woodhouse, besides a low chamber
which answers for storage very nicely, and in a
case of emergency, could be used as a bed-room,
for it is warm and lighted by two windows, one
in each gable; beneath the house there is a good
cellar: then a small but excellent garden plat sur-
rounds the house, and at the further end of the
plat is a barn large enough to shelter a horse and
cow, as well as to contain the winter's fodder.
How do you think this would answer-it is plain
but very decent, and in a most respectable neigh--
borhood?"
" So far I am sure it would. be most satisfac-
tory, sir, but you forget you have not given the
most important item to one who is compelled to
count costs closely."
" Ah ! yes, the rent," exclaimed Judge Fuller-
ton. "Well, the family, who have occupied it
for two years, agreed to pay me a, dollar per
week, though they have always managed to be
sorely behind hand; and what I have got out of
them had cost me more than it has come to, so I
have made u p my mind to let them try another
landlord, for there s no reason why they should
be objects of charity, being all in good health ;
next week they must go; that I think is not an
unreasonable rent ?"- This was said question-
ingly.I
" No, I should think not, for such a snug place,'
was Richard s answer, immediately adding, "and
if we went into this house, sir, there should be
no lack of promptness in paying rent; my father
is a very plain farmer, but he has an independent
and honest spirit."
" And don't lack pride, judging from his son 2'
was the   elder gentleman's smiling  remark.
Richard's face crimsoned, "you need not be
ashamed of it, my son, it is a manly pride that
needs not to be blushed for, a pride that would
compel you to live upon the meanest fare rather
than have it in the power of any man to sky you
owed him ought ; it will insure you success, I
am confident ; but let us remember what we are
about ; if this house suits you, a dollar a week is
all that you will have to pay for rent, as to the
other expenses, you, as a farmer, know them as

to the son to have doubled their receipts, for to
the simple wardrobe of each one had been made
the necessary additions, so that the second
year was begun even more promisingly than had
been the first, yet this partial success had not
come without labor very severe-often weari-
some-for no heart however brave or hopeful
will never feel discouragements when they are
strewn thickly by the way-no hand or head
however willing or strong will never feel fatigue
if constantly taxed. But Richard's heart sink-
ings were never of very long duration, and be-
fore the close of the second year he began to oc-
casionally receive P fee for officiating in some
petty case ; it might be small, but it was a help
to his family. So well did he manage the first
few important matters placed in his hands, in
such a manly and yet such a lawyer like way,
Judge Fullerton, who had already grown to have
the greatest confidence in his pupil, tried him
again and again each time giving him a more im-
portant case, and when the third year o f his
studies commenced, his prospects really began,
to brigthen.
Five years had been the time which his legal
father had at first fixed as necessary to admit
him, well fitted, to the bar, but so rapidly had
Richard advanced in his study, Judge Fullerton
told him at the commencement of the third year,
that a half of his time had expired, that another
two years' close application would fit him thor-
oughly for his examinations and admission. This
was indeed cheering, and but little time did he
have to spend in copying during the coming
months-he had grown a very necessary assist-
ant in more important matters, and this was given
up to those whose time was not as valuable to
others or themselves as had his become.
That was a happy day to all interested in
Richard Sumner, which completed his four years'
study. He passed his examinations with much
credit, and the very week following the one on
which he was admitted to the bar, Judge Fuller-
ton received the young man into his office, no
longer as mere student, but as a partner in his
business. When old Mr. Sumner called upon
his son's friend to thank him for his kindness to
his boy, the Judge said, in reply to his few touch-
ing words of gratitude:
"The obligation is on my side, Mr. Sumner; your
son has become indispensable to me, and you
have yourself alone to thank for the good, whole.,
some lessons which you practised before him of
industry, economy and honesty, and the advan-
tages you gave him for an education. Happily
for you and your family, he has improved upon

these well, and if you live but a few years, sir,
it is my belief you will be the father of a great
man."
The large tears leaped from furrow to furrow
in their uneven course down the old farmer's
cheeks, and when he would have spokes, as he
grasped the hand of Judge Fullerton, something
in his throat choked him, and he turned towards
his cottage home without a word.
" Who'd a thought it, mother, when we fixed
the boy off for the 'cademy, more 'n seven years
ago ! I 'gin to think it may be better 'n farimin';
arter all, though 'twas plaguy hard givin' up the
old place, and it e'en a'most broke my heart, but
we ort to be thankful; yes, mother, we ort to be
very thankful for sich children."
This was the really worthy father's long speech
to his tearful, yet happy-faced wife that night,
after telling her what Judge Eullerton hud said
of Dick; and Mary, the faithful, noble, hoping
worker, was sae not proud of her brother? Many
a time had Richard said to her during these four
years of hard labor, did he succeed it would be
to her he should owe his success. To see such
steady, loving faith as she had ever had in him,
lie would be unworthy such .a sister, did he not
accomplish all she expected of him.,
Perhaps Richard was right ! Every heart has
its fountain of affection, and through that the
intellect may be more easily reached than through
the outward sense of hearing, by dint of long
lectures upon human responsibilities, or per-
chance often repeated assurances to. the slow
plodder in the road to greatness, that he is a
dunce. Both of these last named systems have
too often failed of making.from promising boys
anything but the merest apologies for men, why
should not mother and sisters try faith upon
those Heaven has given them,; it is said to be
powerful enough to remove mountains, may it
not make mountains of goodness and greatness
from those minds which chastisement and blam-
ing would utterly dwarf?
Richard Sumner's first year in his profession
was one of steady success. The senior partner
in the firm soon began to learn the junior had no
common head, to rest upon such young shoulders,
and so unwearying was he, apparently so insensi-
ble to fatigue, he soon surprisedJudge Fullerton,
much as he had grown to expect during those
four years of persevering study.
At the close of the year Richard made the
announcement to the trustees of the village
school, that they would be compelled to seek a
teacher to fill his sister's place. Such a proud
and happy thing as this was for the brother

story.
"And what is the name of this man who had
taken it upon himself to dispose of matters in this
way ?" was the older lawyer's question. "Names
have great weight with me-great weight," he
added.
"Rich, ir; John Rich."
As Mrs. Moulton made this reply, Summer, who
had before been an attentive listener, started, re-
iterating that name three or four times. To the
inquiries as to the cause of his excitement, he
made no answer, save that he thought he had
heard it before, but now his attention became
most intense, and when Judge Fullerton, with his
natural caution, expressed his doubts as to the
advisability of undertaking anything like an in-
vestigation, thatthe villain was too wealthy and
influential, though he believed there had been
foul play, his partner, with much promptness and
earnestness, remonstrated:
"Let them look about, at least," he said, "let
them find what evidence there was against the
man. Mrs. Moulton and her daughter had both
seen a will in favor of the latter, so had Joshua,
who had been a conddential servant. It had been,
a common belief that the young lady was to be
heir to the uncle's estate; there must have been
crooked acting; let them at least do their best to
discover it, if there had been.'
The old Judge caught something of the young
man's enthusiasm, and before the little party
broke up, the lawyer had noted eery important
and unimportant fact connected with the matter,
had learned that Jane, the housekeeper, had gone
with Mr. Rich to his city home, that the home-
stead had been sold for much less than its real val-
ue, and that unless the case should be gained,
neither Mrs, Moultn nor her daughter had much
to spare for lawyer's fees.
In return for all this they eiferced upon the
minds of the three the importance of keeping
positive silence aeon the subjects, if poerible to
lead even their best friends to think they had
abandoned all hope in the matter.

whole thing, but their chief hope depended upon

But at last, to the relief of all, at the end of
three thonths he did return, and when he laid

been the cause of the angry fellow's mishap, the
official exclaimed-
" Begone, you little rascal, or I'll have you ta-
ken to the lock-up ; begone, I tell you, you little
vagabond, and don't letme catch a glimpse of you
again to-night; if you do, I'll put you where
you'll be safe from playing such tricks as this.
Do you hear me, eh ?" and he grasped the little
fellow by his shoulder and shook him in a furious
manner.
Wilson did hear, and young as he was under-
stood what was meant, though he did not an-
swer a word; had he done so, he would probably
have been lugged off to the police station without
hesitation, but as he had not been even guilty of
answering the officer, the latter understood fully
the impropriety of carrying such a child away
without the least grounds for complaint against
him, for the jostle, which had infuriated him so
greatly, had been his own fault and not the boy's;
this he knew. very well, and so Wilson was left
to enjoy his freedom.
But this little incident had aroused him to the
necessity of seeking some place of shelter, for
the next one who should take notice of him might
not allow him to pass as well as had this one.
The hour was already late, and in that large, cold
city there was no heart or house in which Wil-
son felt he had a claim; yet to save himself from
being sent to that home for the homeless, the
friendless, he must find some coner in which to
hide himself away. He was now upon one of the
handsomest streets in this large city, and just as
these thoughts were flitting through his mind,
and he was looking timidly about for some covert
place in which to creep, he espied by the flicker-
ing light of the street lamps that he was standing
opposite a fine house fronted by a latticed veran-
dah. In an instant he thought this might be as
comfortable and secure a place as he should find,
and no one could object to his making his bed
outside the door; within the porch he felt along
the sides until he came to the part most shelter-
ed, and was just preparing to crouch down for
the night, when the unbolting of the door made
him shrink close to the wall; with a savage
growl and bark a dog sprang out and immediate-
ly the door was closed again, and plainly he
heard the bolts and locks secured.
The poor child now trembled with terror, ex,
peeting the instant he should be discovered by
the animal to fall a victim to his rage ; by the
dim light he saw that his size was enormous, but
now his growling had ceased, and the old fellow
was snuffing anxiously towards the corner in
which Wilson was trying to conceal himself, and

to the boy's surprise he came slowly towards his
nook, and after smelling around him fora moment,
the noble fellow stretched himself by the side of
the boy, all the time giving low glad whines and
licking the hands and face of the motherless out-
cast in a way most expressive of fondness. Soon
the poor child lost all terror of his new companion,
and drew his shivering form more closely to the
warm shaggy coat, and with his head resting
within the huge paws of the animal, this boy of
eight years old recalled to mind the assurances
which his mother had so often given him, "that
God would never leave him utterly friendless."
For the first time since his mother's death, the
child raised his heart to Heaven in prayer, and
then with the breath of his new friend falling so
warmly upon his face, he sank into a heavy sleep.
During all the cold dark hours of that night,
this boy, who had never before gone to his bed-
mean though that bed might have been--without
a mother's kiss upon his lips, without a mother's
hand to tuck the scanty covering around his cold
back, slept as one wholly exhausted, dreaming of
that mother who could no more feel the griping
hand of want. 'It was not surprising that he
should sleep, for his watch by his mother's bed-
side had been a long and faithful one; besides the
exposure to cold with the fasting and grief had
been more than enough to exhaust his childish
strength ; but the early dawn of day brought to
poor Wilson a sad awakening; his strangely
watchful bedfellow, with a gentleness which
seemed to partake of intelligence more than ani-
mal instinct, licked the heavy eyes of the boy as
he moved uneasily, and just as the child half
raised himself, looking around in a bewildered
manner, the opening of the hall door helped
him to recall something of the night before.
" Neptune, dear old Neptune, where have you
hid yourself?" was shouted in a clear, childish
voice, and immediately the speaker, a little girl
so lithe and joyous, danced out upon the veran-
dah. " Merry Christmas, you old rogue; see
what Santa Claus has brought you!" and the
little fairy held up in her hand a silver collar,
bright and new.
The dog raised himself upon his fore paws, but
made no move to approach the little one, who was
evidently his young mistress, and in this half
sitting posture he quite concealed the slight form
which nestled at his side. Coming forward, the
child cried out:
" You lazy Neptune, have you no eyes that you
don't see this; you had no stocking to hang up,
so Santa Claus put it into mine; conic, hold up
Your head, and let me trny it on you !

.:_

The coffin was lowered into the pit prepared for
it, and many another one, and throwing in a few
shovels full of dirt, the party turned away with-
out a word. A moment the child lingered, but
the men were not willing to leave him, and one of
them taking him by his slender arm drew him
along to the cart, and thus the funeral ceremonies
of this mother ended. This had been at early


THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.

The little girl had got as far as the dog's side,
and was just about trying the new collar on his
beautiful glossy neck, when she made the discoi-
ery that her pet was not alone ; although she
was startled, there was nothing in the boy's sad
face to alarm her.
"What have you here, dear Neptune ?" she
asked, as she allowed her arm to rest upon the
noble animal's neck, and not satisfied with the
only answer the dog was able to give, a low
whine and delighted wagging of his tail, she ex-
claimed, regarding the companion of her dog in
a half kindly and half curious way:
"Who are you, little - boy ? did Santa Claus
bring you to Neptune? ain't you cold, it seems so
cold out here, and see, your back is all covered
with snow!   What is your name? come, why
don't you speak, what made you sleep out here
with my dear old Neppy ?"
The boy had regarded the little speaker very
earnestly, as she had asked question after ques-
tion, not giving him a chance to answer, had he
been inclined to, and when at last she paused, he
had raised himself to his knees, and with a hand
resting upon the dog, he said:
" My name is Wilson Harley, and I slept here
with your dear, beautiful dog, because it was so
much warmer than in the street."
"The street," was the child's answer; "Oh!
you'd freeze in the street, I'm sure ; but why
didn't you go home ?"
"I hadn't any home to go to, and I was afraid
to stay out any longer."
The voice in which this was spoken was very
tremulous.      I
" No home ! where does your father stay, and
haven't you any brothers and sisters, nor mother
either ?" asked the little girl, bending towards
the kneeling boy.
" I never had a father, nor brothers nor sisters,
and they buried my mother yesterday ; I haven't
got any one to care for me."
"They buried your mother! what for? wasn't
she good, and didn't you love her ?"
This was too much for the poor orphaned boy.
The day before, with all his grief he had no tears
t shed, but the sympathetic questioning of one
so near his own years, so touched his little heart,
he had no power of controlling his emotions, and
hiding his face upon Neptune's shaggy back, he
sobbed out:
" Mother, oh ! mother, mother !"
"Was she so good? did you love her ever so
much? then what did they bury her for I if she'd
been my mother, they shouldn't 'a buried her; I
wouldn't let any one have my mother if I had

one; but I never had any-there, don't cry any
.more, little boy,-did you ever see Santa Claus ?
ah ! he brought me such heaps of pretty things,
and just gee this collar he brought for old Nep-
tune-dear old Neppy-won't-he look nice ! his
hair so black, and this bright as it can be."
" Hetty, where are you, Hetty ?" called a voice
from the door.
" It's my fathe"-said the child, springing to-
wards the door-" Here I am, father, come and
see this little boy--such a strange thing-he
says he's no home, and nobody to love him, and
old Neptune, father, I can't call him away from
this poor little fellow."
"What are you doing here, you little vaga-
bond ?" exclaimed the tall, hard looking mart,
the moment his eyes fell upon Wilson. "Get out
of this, you little thief-aut of this, before I kick
you."
The boy started up, but when the speaker ap-
proached menacingly, the dog, Neptune, seemed
inclined to stand protector to the little intruder
aga net his master, for be uttered a low growl,
keeping himself between the angry man and
child ; nor did the dog prove the only one inclined
to start in the defense of' the stranger. The
girl, Hettie, said with a good deal of firmness
for one so young-
"le ain't a thief, father ; what makes you call
him so? if you should touch him, I think Neptune
would bite you. No, father, you shan't touch
him"-exclaimed the little one springing for-
ward as she saw her parent clench his fist; but
there was no need for theinterference, for the dog
still kept his place between his master and the
little stranger, and his growls were really be-
coaning threatening. As to Wilson, for very
terror, he had not spoken ; but seeing his two
new friends so staunch it his defense, gave him
courage.
"I ain't a thief, sir;. Inever stole anything in my
life; my mother always told me it was very wick-
ed. I wouldn't aslept here if I had known it
would make you so angry ; if you went strike
me I'll go away this minute ."
The boy's gentle, earnest way of speaking,
seemed to have a soothing effect upon the hard,
angry man, or at least acted as a check upon his
movements, for when the poor little fellow pass-
ed very near him to go down the steps, he made
no demonstrations of violence towards him.
Still the dog kept his place between the two,
and when his master made an effort to call him
him back, he stopped, looked around and then
followed the child into the street. Hattie smiled
triumphantly, for well as she loved her pet, Nep-

and  caution, was working beautifully, ann
all had been done so gradually they had rea
son to hope the marks of his suffering would
not be  very lasting.  As to the children
there was just mystery enough about the new
comer to make hiMn a hero in their young imagin-
ations, and add to this the admiration they all
felt for the beautiful dog, Neptune, they were all
in a very interesting state of excitement. The
noble animal, now that they had discovered his
name, seemed much inclined to acknowledge the
little folks as acquaintances, but not a morsel of
food could they prevail upon him to take until
he saw his young master eating of the smoking
chicken broth which grandma had prepared with
her most skillful hand; then with half an eye
upon the recovering Wilson, he took the offered
dainty bits from one hand and then from another
with a care that told he was accustomed to this
delicate way of being f; d.
When Wilson at last opened his eyes and look-
ed about him enquiringly, every little mouth gaped
with curiosity, but the better judgment of the
farmer and his wife forbade it being satisfied that
night.
" Here is your dog, my poor little boy; you
see you are among friends ; all you can be per-
mitted to say to-night is, tell me what we are to
call you! "
There was something so tenderly, mother-
like, in Mrs. McDonald's voice as she said this
it made the poor child feel that lhe was not alone;
he remembered the morning, how he had been
driven from the porch of that elegant city home
by that cold, hard man, who seemed at enmity
even with his dog; how doubly desolate had he
felt as he turned his step towards his mother's
grave, praying in his little heart to die; but for
the dog Neptune he might, perhaps, have be-
lieved he had changed worlds, so different did
everything seem about him, so beautifully kind
was every face, and the voice of that mother-it
was like what he might have imagined in angels.
But the presence of his noble dog, regarding him
with such anxious affection, was sufficient evi-
dence to the child that he was still on the earth.
"Wilson Harley is my name-my mother called
me Willie," was his answer to Mrs. McDonald's
inquiry as to what they were to call him.
Even the half wild Jemmy and Davie were
struck with the musical softness of his voice ; a
moment more his large eyes were fixed 'upon
that sweet mother's face which bent over him,
and then he added:
" You may call me Willie; when you spoke it

d made me happy, it sounded like my mother-will
- you call rue Willie?"
" Yes, my child we will call you Willie, if you
wish it; now shut your eyes and don't speak any
more; you are not well, Willie, and we can't let
- you talk to-night; if you are better in the morning
' you may speak all you like."
The child lay shutting and opening his eyes in
a languid manner like one wholly exhausted and
riot anxious ever to make another exertion, and
at last his half dreaming vague thoughts of his
r loved mother and that over bending face became
l so happily combined in his mind, he felt no longer
motherless, friendless, homel ss, and he fell into
a quiet refreshing sleep.
The shadows of evening were gathering in this
farm home, and the father, with his boys Jernmy
and Davie, put on coats, caps and comforters,
and went to the barns to attend to the feeding and
caring for their sleek, well kept stock; while the
mother and grandma turned their attention to the
little household matters, to making everything
cheery for the evening; so only the younger chil-
dren lingered near their little visitor to watch
him and his beautiful Neptune. No sooner dii
the dog see his master sleeping, than he stretched
himself upon the floor, his face toward the settle,
and with his nose resting upon his outstretched
paws, he watched the child with half closed eyes.
It was a most lovely sight, such an one as might
have charmed others than the McDonalds, but im
their minds they were already forming plans for
the grandest sport, in which Neptune and Willie
were to figure largely ; for front the good old
Scotch grandmother to the six-year old Mamy,
every mind was made up as to Willie really be-
longing to them; and it was not surprising that
the novelty should have its charm for the little
ones, for not a half dozen times in the whole year
were they accustomed to being assisted in their
snorts or studies by any one outside their little
circle, and each one had determined Willie should
be made the happiest boy in the world.
The little earnest Mamy, as she sat upon her
little stool rocking the cradle, thought how she
would show him all -her picture books and tell
him the beautiful stories her mother had told
her ; then to her mind he was just the boy to
take some interest in doll-babies; if he would
help her in caring for her numerous family what
a nice thing it would be, for her only sister was
this wee baby in the cradle, and her brothers had
no fancy for such quiet fun; Jemmy didn't object
to having a nice frolic with his sister's darlings
if he could have it in his own way ; but nothing

become the pet plaything of every member of the
family, a sweet romping child, loving and beloved
by everybody.
From Mrs. McDonald's face, one was inclined
to say not only years but care had touched her
lightly, and mother never looked upon her grow.
ing family with a more heart-felt gratitude than
did this faithful worker. Nor was it only youth
and those in vigorous life that time had spared ;
still the quiet grandmother was there to smile upon
the p-osperity of her children, and her grand
children, some of them grown quite to manhood,
knew no greater pleasure of an evening than to
gather in grandma's room and listen to some story'
of her girlhood, when her home had been far, far
away, in that land of real Lairds, which no true
Scotch heart, while it has a throb of life, can
cease to remember with a child's devoted love;
and none loved these little gatherings more than
did Wilson Harley, now known to the family and
all their friends as. Willie McDonald; with the
other children he was often declared "grandma's
favorite.  But she had no favorites in her affec-
tions, though Willie's never-failing attention to
her every little want, made her depend upon him
more than upon any other one of the family, and
his voice was so clear, although it had become
quite difficult for her to hear common conversa-
tion, she never lost a word he said to her, though
he didn't speak half so loud as did the other boys;
on this account, Willie was nearly always the dear
old woman's reader, and of winter evenings there
was nearly always to be found a little party of
three, in the snug little room, grandma occupying
her old-fashioned high-backed rocking chair, and
her " eternal knitting" as Jemny called her never
failing knitting work, occupying her fingers; near
herjut beside the little table, Willie with his
book had his place, and opposite him, busy with
her sewing, Mary was nearly always found; but
this did not make up the whole of the little cir.
cle; laying at the young girl's feet, upon a com-
fortable cushion, was the old dog Neptune. He
had become a veteran indeed, but the tender care
he had received had kept him hale and hearty, in
spite of age, and no one di-puted tme- good old
fellow's right to lay at Mary's feet, let her choose
her seat wherever she might; the moment he saw
her settled, with his comfortable cushion in his
mouth, he would walk-with not exactly the
elastic step of a young dog, for his limbs were
considerably affected by rheumatism; and it was
in consideration of this slight ailment, that he
was honored with a cushion-but his gait -and
manner had in them much of sober dignity, as he
would move across the room, and after deposit-

ing the cushion in a satisfactory style at the feet
of the young girl, he would stretch himself upon
it, his soft clear eyes, as they were opened and
shut lazily, speaking cf his heart full of content-
ment.
Such was the family which filled the very com-
fortable home of farmer McDonald, and never
for a moment had any one felt regret that the
homeless Wilson Harley had found a place in
their home as well as in their hearts on that bit-
ter Christmas afternoon long years ago; yet in
the minds of all the McDonald'stie motherless
Wilson had become completely lost in their own
brother Willie, loved not a grain less because he
was brother and son by adoption instead of by
birth.
"What are you looking for, Mary, child ? You
have stood at the window well nigh an hour and
not a word have I heard you speak in all that
time. Are you expecting any one, dearie, that
your eyes have not been turned to the right or
left this long time ? "
" Father must be coming'soon, grandma, and I
was watching for him."
" And why she uld you watch so steadily, Mary;
it's nae sae uncommon a thing for him to gang
awa' that ye should be sae anxious, my bairnie ! "
" But, grandma, father has gone to the city to
see about a place for Willie ; I heard him talking
with mother and Willie before he went away this
morning ; Mr. Phelps has for a long time been
offering a place in his store to one of the boys,
and to-day father has gone there to decide whether
he will accept it, and I heard him say it was just
the business for Willie."
" Your faither is right, Mary. Willie is a right
smart laddie, but nae just sae strang to be put to
books like Jemmy or to farming as Davie; he
must ha' something that will tax mind and body
alike, and a merchant house must be of that kind.
Why dinna ye answer, my bairn, are ye displeas-
ed that your father should think of sending the
laddie awa' to the city ? '
There was something of trembling in the voice
which said : "No grandma, you know I would not
think of being displeased with what father and
mother thought best to do; but wont it be very
lonesome to have Willie go away? We shall all
miss Jernmy very much, and- I have been sad
enough when I remember how close at hand the
time is for him to go away ; but to have Willie
go too, it will be so lonesome we shan't know how
to live, and I'm sure I don't know what you will
do, grandma, when the long evenings come-no
body to read to you."
"What are you to be about, bairnie, all the time,

better that he should be away. And now, Mary,
are you satisfied as to family."
"Yes, David, I should think our Willie might
be very comfortable there; that he would not miss
those he leaves at home more than we could wish
him to."
"And what do you say, my boy ?" asked the
farmer of the youth.
"That it is best for me to go, father; I am not
needed at home, and- it is time I began to think
about doing something.."
"That is right, Willie; I am glad to hear you
speak so decidedly, for it seems a very favorable
opportunity. Now, how soon can you get him
ready, Mary, for Mr. Phelps said they were in a
very busy time, and the sooner he could have
Willie, the better he should be pleased."
And, now between the farmer and his wife,
grandma andWillie, there was planning and talk-,
ing, which ended in the conclusion that the nild-
die of September was the earliest possible time
that the boy could leave home for the city ; now
it was the last week in August and there was
much to be done in these three weeks, for this
was the time fixed upon for the departure of the
eldest son from his home to commence the study
of medicine with an uncle in an Eastern city.
This uncle was his mother's brother! He held a
very high place in his profession, and when on a
visit to his sister a few months previous, had
taken a great liking to the bright, spirited
James, insisting upon his being sent to him
to be fitted for the medical profession. He
had no sons of his own,, and had seemed so anx-
ious for this, that at last the parents had been in-
duced to think it best that they should be sepa-
rated from their child, since such .advain  Y s as
were now offered him, their moderate cicum-
stances would not allow them t, give all their
children. The uncle had assured the parents
that there could be no lack of home enjoyments
to their son in his house, his wife was of that class
of women whose province was her own fireside,
and nothing would gratify her more than the
presence of her husband's nephew in her family !
And as there was in the city a medical college of
the very best standing, there seemed every in-
ducement for their accepting the offer, which was
not to cast their carefully trained son upon
strangers for society.
This had ever been the* loving mother's anxi-
ety as she each day had studied to make their
home the most attractive place on earth to her
children; the thought would continually come up
that by-and-bye they might be cast upon strangers
wh would care very little whether they were

RLESS BAIRN.
happy or miserable. She could scarcely hope
that it would be otherwise with some, at least,
of such a numerous family, and then'they would
be driven to seek society where snares were
thickly spread ; her husband had shared this
anxiety, realizing the dangers which the world
contains for those cast upon it for society much
better than she could, especially those who had
been raised in the pure atmosphere of such a
home, and this was his very good reason for
making every effort towards fitting them for set-
tling them as fast as they came of an age to decide
what was best suited to their tastes and capaci-
ties. They must not think of the pain ;attending
a separation; their children were not given them
to hold selfishly, but to prepare for acting a part
in the world, and if that preparation could not be
made fully while under the eye of their parents,
then father and mother must resign their society
for a time that their trust might be well kept.
But well did they look to making this going
away as pleasant as it might be. There must be
a home to go after each day's labor ; a table to
sit at, healthful morally, intellectually and physi-
cally; and since nothing of this could be found in
a boarding house, no boarding house could receive
their well-bred country boys ; and until a place
within a quiet family circle was secured to re-
ceive them, they said " no" to all business offers,
no matter hoy advantageous they might seem.
All had listened to the conversation which re-
lated to Willie's going to the city, and when it
was at last settled that he and James were to
leave home on the same day, the latter exclaimed,
in his' gay, thoughtless way,
"I'm glad we're going at the same time, Wil-
lie, for my irnd has been oppressed with the
conviction tte-t 1 shouldn't be miss d in a way
which would be very flattering; for my life I can't
make out that I am a particle of use to any
one in the establishment, and I am convinced,
were they to make any demonstrations of sorrow
when I am going, they must be so feeble as not
to be satisfactory. But you'tl be missed by all,
from grandma down to Amy, and I can'have
a chance to go in for a share of the tears which
will be shed for you'"
" For shame! my son, to speak in this way of
the grief we must all feel at losing you for a
time!" the mother's voice was almost reproach-
ful as she said this; "you don't deserve the regret
we must all feel, Jemmy, if you speak in this
thoughtless way of it."
" No, mother, I was not thoughtless, but more
serious than I often am; I have felt this very
much. Who ever calls upon me for anything?' In

THE MITER
truth, I believe the only decided thing I do for
anybody in the house is to torment the younger
children, that I may hear them makeitheir droll
complaints to you, mother; and then I enjoy my
peace-making with you after they are sent away
so much ; how can I help feeling my absence will
relieve them of a pesterer, and you of a great.
care ?"
The speaker's voice had lost much of its gaiety,
as this was said in a way that left no room for
any doubt as to his seriousness. Littly Amy,
who was usually his victim, but who after all
loved him with a child's capricious fondness, was
upon his eldest brother's lap, lavishing upon him
her sweetest caresses as an assurance that after
all lhis teazing he was the best brother in the
world, and all save the grandmother expressed
their full agreement with the child.
" Ye said right, Jeminy, yer deeds bae been nae
praiseworthy; butye hae weel managed the heart
o' every ane o' the household, that whether we
would or nan, we maun lo'e ye, and we shall miss
you sairly, laddie, but nae sae selfishly as your
brither Willie !"
As the young man bent over the old lady to
kiss her wrinkled cheek for this loving chiding, a
tear fell upon her old withered hand, and in an
instant all her assumed severity was gone.
"Ye're a gude laddie, Jenmy, yell be missed
all---eairly missed, I tell ye, my bairn-" and
with this the old grandmother hurried to her own
room, where an hour or two after the children
found her as usual, very calm and cheerful, but
her eyes bore the traces of tears.-
After all his thoughtless gaiety, this youth, her
David's first born, was the darling of the old
woman's heart, and many a tear had fallen silent-
ly as she had thought of his departure from his
home; but so quiet had been her grieving, the
object of them had no suspicions that she gave
him a thought.
The three weeks which followed the -cision
that Willie should go to the city were buy ones
with the farmer's home, and no one could have
imagined that one of the two youths, for w hom
all these preparations were making, had been a
stranger to the house until he was eight years
old; in everything they were equal, and Davie,
who continually asserted his determination to
stick to home and the farm life, declared that but
for old Neptune he should believe it was all a
dream! that Christmas day! And to all it was
much like a dream, but to none more so than to
Willie.; even to this time his foster-niother often
talked with him of that other mother who had
so long been at rest; but his heart no longer

LESS BAIRN.                                35
grieved over the death of one who had kum N
naught but sorrow. He loved the family who had
adopted him as they had been his own, and ne -
er had they allowed him to feel himself alone.
Yet at the same time his ambitions were not the
same that they might have been had he been a
child by birth; all this love and care would then
have come naturally, and, like his brothers, he
would have been content to receive it without
further thought; now it was owing to th ir pure
benevolence, and he would reward them by pro -
ing himself worthy the affection which had so
blessed him.
To Mary these three weeks were very sad ones;
to lose two brothers at one time was more thin
she knew well how to endure, but there was to
much to be done-to have any time to spend in
repining, and from daylight until late in the evei-
ing the young girl kept her place in her grand-
mother's room, stitching busily upon the shift ts
which were to form a part of the brother's oow-
fit; but in spite of her bravest iflrts the tears
would sometimes coiuplet ly blind her over lr
work. 'T'hese evenings of sewing were, howit -
er, never tedious, for \Willie,vsith his book, never
failed to be ii his place, and the eldest brother

just none at all, for the most selfish fellow in the
world would do all that he had done,jIst for tlie
pleasure to be derived from it. And Jmmes was

Willie was of Davie's opinion, and thought the
longer they delayed their departure the more pain
were they giving their mother and all their dear
ones, and so the two were soon seated in the
wagon which was to take them to the depot wait-
ing to be joined by the eldest brother, who might
have lingered, no one could tell how long, hadinot
his father suggested the possibility of his being
left behind, did he not hasten his last adieus.,
The poor old grandmother felt the parting more
deeply than did any other member of the family,
but in the solitude of her own room she gave vent
to her grief, for well she knew that each heart felt
sadness enough without having it increased by
witnessing her emotion, which she could not
subdue.
Such was the home which the motherless Wil-

establishment could scarcely fail to be annoying;
yet Wilson was one to become very soon accus-
tomed to change, and the second week he was
nearly as much at home behind the counter as
from long practice he had become at swinging the
scythe or holding the plough; and not more dif-
ficult was it for the well-bred youth to learn the
real comforts to be found in the simple elegance
of the home surroundings.
Mr. Phelps soon saw he should have no cause
to regret the addition he had made to his house-
hold. Having been trained by such a tender

"Hush! hush ! every one of you-no, Jack,
don't say any thing more"- said the mother in a
kind but determined voice-"your pa was speak-
ing to Wilson, yet you have given him no chance
to answer ; now mind you are not to open your
lips to speak one word, my sons, till you show a
better humor."
"And aint Delia to hold her tongue too ? she
began."
" Jack, be quiet or I shall send you away from
the table; that is not a very good humored remark;
you are in an unenviable state of mind this morn-
ing, and I shall be compelled to punish you if I
see much more of it."
This acted as a-.silencer upon the little fellow,
but it was a very surly-obedience. Wilson liked
these children for they were really geod hearted
boys, and Delia, a handsome, high spirited girl,
often amused him very much ; but it was impossi-
ble for him to be among them, and not often in his
mindcontrast them and his young brothers and
sisters well trained, and no matter how full of
fun, never forgetting the obedience and respect
which they owed their parents, or even their eld-
er brothers and their quiet sister Mary. Yet the
Phelps children were very fond of each other,
and doatingly fond of their parents ; but a little
firmness was required on the part of the parents
to make them a most loveable little family, and
the absence of this respectful governing bid fair
to make them little better than their ungainly
brother, who had caused the father and mother
too many saddening hours ; yet Mrs. Phelps was
very desirous of training her children rightly, and
fully believed she did her very best towards mak-
ing them well mannered ; she did not realize that
such a surly obedience as her boy Jack had given
her at the breakfast table was not obedience, but
the result of fear that he should be sent away
with a half completed meals and no acknowledg-
ment of a mother's right to command obedience,
" Let's see ! this is Friday, you will be back
on Monday morning, r suppose, Wilson ?" asked
Mr. Phelps, when order was once more restored
among the younger members of the family.
" Yes, sir, I will try to get back by the first
train, which I am sure I can do as father is a
very early riser."
"By the first train ! Oh ! well that will be very
convenient, though I should not have required it.
I hope you will enjoy your visit, Wilson, the
weather promises to be very fine, and a few days
in the country would'nt be unpleasant to any one.
Call at the store, if you please, on your way to
the depot; I have a letter to write fcryour father,
which, if you will take that trouble, I will intrust

to your care ; you can't have muclh time to lose,
it's half-past eight and the cars start at half-
past nine, so you had better come right along
with me."
This the merchant said as he arose from the
breakfast table, at the same time looking at his
watch. Wilson 'was not sorry to accompany his
employer, for he had already began to feel a full
measure of impatience to be on his way. As they
walked quickly in the direction of the mercantile
house, Mr. Phelps talked to his clerk in the kind-
est possible manner of his future, and then alluded
to his position in his family ; he told him that he
must not allow Jack and Billy to encroach upon
his hours of leisure, which in justice to himself he
should devote to useful reading, save sufficient to
be spent in active out-of-door'exercise.
" Now I will detain you but a moment ; I
would write your father a few words, which you
shall deliver to him." This the gentleman said
as he approachad his desk and proceeded to ex-
amine the outside of a handful of letters which
had been left there for him. "Here, Wilson,"
he said, turning to his companion and extending
towards him  a letter, " here is something for
you, from your brother, if I mistake not, in Bos-
ton, I think you said he was."
The youth answered in the affirmative, at the
same time grasping the letter, -which, from its
size, was far more properly called a package.
"Now your time of waiting wont be tedious,"
was the employer's remark, as he opened his
desk and proceeded to write to farmer McDonald
a few lines expressive of his perfect satisfaction
in his son.
Wilson' was not long in breaking the seal' of
his brother's letter, for he had heard from him but
once since his arrival in his new home, and he
was all eagerness to learn how everything ap-
peared to the gay fellow after a little better
acquaintance. The letter commenced:
"Willie, my dear fellow, I have now so much
to write I hardly know where to begin ; your
letter was received more than a' week ago; its
contents gave me overwhelming pleasure ; but I
was not at all disappointed, for the Phelps family
would be in pretty business to treat you in any
other way than with the greatest consideration.
Ask mother and dear grandma as to the respect-
ability of the McDormlds and the Wallaces,
which last, you know, was mother's name, and
you will see either of them grow a full inch taller

calls it; no, there is scarcely a family in the land
who has a broader foot-hold for their pride than
ours ; but I must acknowledge I never knew

much of this until I came to live with uncle
James. We lived so quietly at home ! father and
mother were forever too much absorbed in keep-
ing their harum-scarum boys in order, to attend
much to the display of family dignity. I presume
they were right. Ah ! Willie is it not a comfort
to think of our life at home? We have reason,
at least, to be proud of the part of our family
which we have known. A woman who on every
occasion won the love and admiration of her
children, who never humbled herself before one
of them by losing the command of her temper,
who never left one of her boys even in anger, but'
forced them to see their fault in its true light.

"Give my love to Mamy and a caress to old

And this was from the gay thoughtless James
McDonald, who had but one month ago left his
home as frolicsome and fun loving as when he
was no more than a dozen years old. But to
Wilson it possessed a higher interest than even
the 'change which it showed to have taken place
in the mind and heart of the writer. So much
had he become absorbed in the reading, that but
for his employer Wilson would have allowed
the train to have left him, Mr. Phelps, for a
few moments, watched the youth, rather hesi-
tating to interrupt him, but when he saw no
signs of an end to the work in hand, he said :
" The letter is ready for your father, Wilson,
and as it wants but a few moments of car time, I
would propose that you get aboard before finish-
ing the reading of your letter, for you would not
like to be left behind."
Wilson's face crimsoned with mortification,
that he had been guilty of forgetting himself so
completely, but thanking his employer he folded
his brother's letter hastily and placed it with the
one for his father in his pocket, he bade thekind
Mr. Phelps good bye, and made his way with no
lingering step towards the depot.
In his seat the boy was at liberty to give hiui.

self up to the perusal of this interesting cominu-
nication, and not until he was well nigh his jour-
ney's end did he refold and place it in security.
Often enough had Wilson walked through the
crowded streets peering into every face which he
met or passed, hoping that fate might throw the
child Hettie in his way, but all his search had
been in vain. As to the house which had been the
child's home so many years ago, he had not the
most distant idea of its whereabouts, for on that
tedious Christmas morning the poor boy had pos-
sessed neither eyes nor heart for the surrounding
world. Many had been the time he had strolled
through the streets at evening trying to select the
handsome building in the perch of which he had
crouched for shelter, but so many of the houses
had the same appearance, he could form n iblai
of its locality even! Then to at last learn 'w ho
was the child, to have her, after so many years,
tell the sad story of his destitution, and express
such a desire to hear what had been his fate, was
it strange that his boyish heart was stirred with
deep emotions ?
lHe was by no means blind to the deep interest
his brother's letter expressed, nor did it give himii
any anxiety, but he did long to consult his moih-
er before answering James' inquiries as teo t4he
propriety of revealing to this young girl the--
cret to her very interesting story. Jamce' vwiih,
however, that none of his family, save Mary,
should see his letter, put this last it if the b1140's
power, and made up his mind to read the wliole
thing with his sister and abide by her decision,
and with this conclusion he set out upon his two
miles' wall, which was to end at the door of the
McDonald farm house, and a warm wI elec (Ie did
he find awaiting hini there !lie had not lee eicx-

gave all additional pleasure.
The thousand questions which were showered
upon him defied all attenips at answering, par-
ticularly with such difficulties as the y outh had to
contend with in the shape of fond kisses and
caresses. Little Amy, who in the affeetions of
parents, brothers and sister felt no inclination to
yield her place to elders or superiors, in spite of
coaxings or remonstr:ances, accrued bent on siffi-
eating their visitor, and not until her gramihca in-
terposed her emphatic thre'it to exclude the child
from her room for a whole day unless she behaved
more as a reasonable being, could they unlock her
little arms which clasped Willie's neck. lut t he
child knew  too well the folly of expecting iny
swerving in her grandparent, after once her word
had passed; and the idea of being banished fromin

would have been terrible enough,-but now,'
when dear Willie was with them, to come into
such disgrace would be almost unbearable; but
to think of him and Mary with the young broth-
ers, and that gayest of all brothers Davie, with
whom she was something more than with anybody
else, congregated around the delightful crackling
fire in the evening, listening to one of grandma's
stories, such an one as was sure to be brought forth
on so rare an occasion; end she always had the very
best place for seeing everybody in the circle, of
hearing all that was said, and asking all the ques-
tions she chose-to be excluded from the room-
the bare thought was enough to make her a tol-
erable biddible child.
But while all the rest now took their turns in
the greetings, the little sprite was off to a pas-
ture, a long way from the house, to carry the
glad tidings to Davie, who was engaged upon the
repairing of a sheep-shed, and although the
pleasure of carrying such glad tidings was a suf-
ficient reward for her long breathless run, her
brother's resources for giving her pleasure never
failed him, and now mounting the delighted girl
upon his horse, which he had there to assist him
in the dragging of some heavy timbers, he sprang
on behind her and the two had a grand half
mile's canter home, arriving just as the idea had
entered the heads of the younger boys to carry
the news of Willie's arrival so unexpected to
their elder brother! But their little sister too

"My dear sir--As your son is about starting
for his home on a visit of a few days, 'I cannot
deny myself the pleasure of writing you a fewj
words, expressive of my perfect satisfaction of
our new relation. He has a good business mind,
much better than you gave me any reason to ex-
pect, and judging from his appearance he is
pleased with his situation. If it would be any
satisfaction to you to know what I think of
him intellectually and morally, it is enough
for me to say I should be proud to be called
FATHER by such a     youth.  I hope much
from his influence over my boys-indeed my
wife says he is already much more to them
and our daughter than are all their teachers ; and
here I have an idea your advice might be of great
service to the boy ; by your fatherly arraige-
ment his evenings are his ow:2, but as yet he has
derived very little good from them, for my chil-
dren have discovered that he possesses an almost
magical power of teaching what was before un-
learnable to them, and while heshows a willing-
ness to assist them, they won't listen to my per-
suasions to leave him quiet for even a moment.
Besides, I am nearly always away, and so have
very little control over my family. As to my

dling always seems veryunpleasant. I wish you
all much pleasure in this visit, and hope Wilson
will not be the less content for it when he returns
to our home, and now it is time for him to be off.
Yours very respectfully,       A. PHELPS.
The end of this letter was greeted with a shout
from David, and all felt inclined to laugh at the
closing charge, that the boy should know nothing
of its contents, when he and his brothers and
sisters had already listened to the whole reading.
" I can see no harm in your having heard it,"
remarked the father. "There is no danger of
your looking upon it in the light Mr. Phelps feared
you might. The deepest intere t in your welfare
suggested the writing of it, and I am sure we
must all think him very kind."
"Very kind, may be, David, but nae so very
clever. Is it mair needful to his bairns that
they hae siller mair than will meet their wants,
or a faither's care?  Puir laddies ! it will be nae
sae muckle their fault if they grew up fules."
This the old grandmother said with all her
Scotch severity.
" No, nd, mother, you must be just; Mr, Phelps
provides the best of teachers f'or his children,
and it would hardly be his fault if they do
badly."
"David, I tell you a' the teachers in the land
are nae sac gude as the laddie's ain faither, and
the tnither-if she be such an one as should be-
is better than either. Where would hae been a'
yer ain bairns but for Mary's teaching and care;
and noo in a' the country round ye'll find a better
taught family than yer, ain, David! and yet ye
talk o' teachers for this merchant man's wee,
tender things?
But mother, you forget we were ,too poor to
have teachers for all our large family. Had I
been but a quarter as rich as Mr. Phelps, I
would never have permitted Mary to take such
a burden upon herself as she was compelled to
in this thing."
" I know, David, the mither o' yer bairns has
nae had an idle life ! But has she nae a light
heart noo, when her work is so weel promising
in the world, and the lad o' this rich man, I did
not hear ye say he had made the heart o' his pa-
rents sairby his wrang doings. Nae, my son, I
like nae the man's writings o' his children, or
their mither-its nae praiseworthy, but our Wil-
lie has been too well trained to gain ill frae ain
mair feeble than himsel."
The old lady spoke in a stern disapproving tone,
which her son well understood, and anything from
him would but increase her severity, and had he
spoke frankly he would have condemned the care-

less manner in which Willie's employer alluded
to his wife and children, but the little this good
farmer had seen of business men, had convinced
him that once allow the mind to become absorbed
in the pursuit of wealth, there was great danger of
the best part of man's nature-his pure domestic
tastes-completely dying out: and when the fat h-
er once becomes negligent of the little circle, who
have a right to look to him for love and tender-
ness ; when he shifts all his duties on the mother
of his children, can he complain that she in her
turn, wearied with a life barren of s3 mpathy,
leaves her work to be done by hirelings. And then
when the offspring grow up, fit only to spend im
dissipation and recklessness the gold which their
father had hoarded up for them in lieu of instilling
into their minds good precepts, and by ex:niple
teaching them that life was an earnest thing, thii
shall they dare to imurpiur that they have been
denied the treasure which they see their more
humble neighbors in the full enjoyment-children,
which are a crown of glory to their world wea-
ried parents ?
These reflections had some influence in prevent-
ing farmer McDonald from defending this wealthy
man against his excellent mother's attack. With
her sterling goed sense and quick perception he
knew she saw the evil, and since fault findingaind
censure would do no good, he thought it better
that nothing more should be said.
But there was one other in this little family
circle who had his thoughts of this way of leav-
ing children to hirelings-that was Willie ; and
his old grandmother had spoken truly when she
said there was no danger of his learning ill from
one more feeble than himself; but he was not at
all inclined to give up his fhice of helping the
Phelps children, for he was becoming really at-
tached to them, and their doleful stories of Ihwir
ill-tempered teacher had quite excited his coii-
passion. As to his parents interforing, he had no
fear of that; it had been too much the business of
one child to assist another in their family, for
either of his parents to look upon it with disalp-
proval.
"Serve them  as you do the boys and Amy,
Willie, they are very kind to you there. If you
can in some measure return the kindness-wthich
we know you can by your attention to the boys-
it is no more than right. We would rather you
would be in the family as one of them, even sup
posing you do sometimes have annoyances, than
that you should be excluded from the domestic
circle. If the little fellows grow to be trouble-

little brothers, for now you know there isno dan-
ger of offending the parents.".
"Yes, he says there is a girl, too, as old as
Mamy"-put in David-" he is to pull her ears,
ain't he father? And now I'm so glad business
is done the first thing ; you know your line of
action, Willie ; hurrah ! won't you have a jolly
time when you get back to the city folks, and
won't we have a jolly time while you are here,
hurrah ! my boy, why don't you shout just once ;
so much room as there is here, no brick walls or
dusty streets," and the sturdy young farmer per-
formed the most ridiculous antics, first with
kicking his slouched hat in the air, and then by
upsetting his youuger brothers.
Every member of the farmer's family seemed
to c-tch the gaiety of its master-spirit, and Willie
took deep breaths of enjoyment, whether sport-
ing with the children, laughing with David andI
Mary, or talking more gravely with their parents
and grandmother. It was strange that the youth
never indulged in those longings so common with
orphans or foundlings-longing for kindred in
blood. But he never had-his life had been too
full of love for him to wish for more, and blessed
by such parents, brothers and sisters, was it not
sufficient?  To wish that his own mother could
have lived seemed to him cruel, so pale had been
her cheek, and languid her step, what could there
have been in her toilsome life that one who loved
her should desire its continuance? 'Tis true, he
sometimes had dreams of his father-who he had
been, and was he living or dead, but one thing he
knew: to him he had ever been dead, and was it
not enough that his mother had been pure as an;
angel? But all this would have been so differ-
ent but for the wholesome home training which
had surrounded him. No questionings of his
parenta,'e, no allusions to the past, save to speak
to him in the most loving manner of his dead mo-
ther ; no recalling of his destitution, or reminding
him of his dependence. From the fond old grand-
mother down to the petted Amy, he was their
own Willie as entirely as had he been born in the
house; his place was as secure as was that of the
first-born, not only in hearts, but in home; and
none, to have seen him among his dear ones, to
have looked into his clear, happy eyes, would
have dreamed this could be the sad, motherless
child who had on that Christmas eve wandered
homeless and hopeless through the dismal streets
of the heartless city-thought of by none, cared
for by none-for whom no simple heart gave a
throb. Now home and love were his, and the
world was no longer cold or desolate !

CHAPTER Vi.
"Love is a sickness fnll of woes,
All remedies refusing;
A plant that with most cutting grows,
Most barren with best using."-[ANON.
The first and second day of Willie's home visit
passed, and yet not even for one little minute had
he been able to steal Mary from the rest of the
family for a private reading of that letter which
was hid away in a most secret place, and which
contained so much that was deeply interesting to
him; and Sunday promised to bring little more
than had Friday or Saturday, for the day was
already waning, and yet all that the youth had
done towards the accomplishment of the desired
object, was to whisper Mary that in some way
she must get rid of the tormenting children as he
could not go away without seeing her by herself
for a half hour at least, as he had something from
their brother Jemmie, which he must read to
her, and which no one else could be permitted to
see.
This made the girl so fidgety, she stood a very
good chance of disclosing the whole secret. If
Willie had but told her he wished a half-hour
with- her alone, it would have been enough, but
hearing it was something about Jemmie, some-
thing which was to be concealed from the rest of
the family, nearly upset the child. She was yet
but a young girl-had not even got rid of her
little girl tastes, but such a constant companion-
ship with mother and grandmother had made her
a strange mixture of woman and child; and now-
so like as it will with a woman-the dreadful
apprehension of temptation, and a yielding to it,
came stealing over her. But no sooner was she
conscious of the presence of the thought than
did she, with quick anger at herself, repel it as
unworthy the sister of their dear James.
"No, oh ! no," she said to herself, "Jemmie
is too noble, he is too strong; nothing could make
him forgetful of himself, of the loving hearts which
would be wrung with agony, if but the shadow
of shame were to fall upon him. No, it is not
that, or Willie could not have been so happy all
this time ; neither can he be sick, for Willie
would not keep that from father and mother ;
he must be home-sick, yet loath to tell of it; must
be wretched away from     parents, grandma,
brothers and sisters; must be pining to get back
into their' loving midst! Oh, if it is only this,"
she continued to herself, with the greatest en-
thusiasm, "wont we all open our arms to wel-
come him to his old place again!"
Dear little Mamy, with all her heart-with all
her -womanly feelings, she had no suspicions of
the truth'; she had no dream of their dear James

falling in love, and that too with a child not a
year older than herself-not a year older than his
own little sister! as he was ever calling her "the
heroic defender of a whole family of broken-
headed doll-babies." But, when a youth, not yet
too old to delight in victimising unfortunate dolls,
takes it upon himself to fall in love, it seems
most fitting that the recipient of his passionate
devotion should be one, not yet passed the tender
age, which feels for the miseries of such senseless

From Mary now he could only expect com-

that at last he had been outwitted ; but for their

It was very seldom that this young girl forgot
her timidity so entirely, even with those of her
own family, to speak so unreservedly, and prob-
ably she had never givens her adopted brother a
greater pleasure than now in speaking so frankly
of their relation. He too had often of late the
same feeling when thinking upon those who had

come to be all in life to him, he was thankful they
were not his family by nature; at any time, even
a month ago, he could not have explained the
cause of such a feeling, but- absence from his
home, and more than all, this letter from James,
had opened his eyes somewhat, not only to the
understanding of his brother, but as well to a
little more clear understanding of himself.
A minute Wilson thought of this, hesitating,
whether or not it would be right to throw a new
light into the mind of this child-woman; by ex-
plaining James' reluctance to speak to the young
girl of him; evidently Mary had no suspicion of
the truth, yet he was confident but a word would
be required to make her see all in its real light,
but without that word it was all a puzzle to her;
at length he said:
"Mary, can't you imagine Jemmie may prefer
remaining the object of chief importance with
this interesting stranger? Although 1 would not
accuse him of insincerity in what he said of his
brotherly attachment and unwillingness that the
world should know that we were not by nature
brothers, yet I think there was still an higher
motive in this case for his keeping silent; he was
not even willing to speak of old Neptune to this
Henrietta Farnham; he would have been jealous
of one little thought she might have given her
dog, once so dearly loved ; and the same feeling
prevented his telling her of me. Do you not
think so, my dear Mary?"
The young girl looked at her companion half
doubtingly.
" What do you think, Willie? or I know what'
you, think; but Jemmie is so yourg to us, younger
than you are; can it be that h6-can it be as you
think ?
" Don't you think it is, Mamy? Just read that
letter to yourself, and then tell me why did he
say father and mother would call him a foolish'
boy, and why would David laugh, if he was not
guilty of something to him unusual? I know we
have all regarded him as a boy among us, but
that letter shows him possessed of deeper and
more manly feeling than we had any of us imag-
ined ever moved him, so gay and light hearted as
he has ever been, and I am much mistaken, my
little Mamy, if he has not ventured upon that
very man-like perforiance of falling in love with
my old friend of thd parch; when you have given
that letter a second reading you will agree with
me, I have no doubt about it."
Mary took the letter which her companion
handed her and read it through very carefully,
judging from the time which was consumed
in the operation, and when she came to the end,

she folded it up silently, her face looking very
anxious and seber.
" Well, Mary, tell me what new discovery have
you have made, for you have changed very much
during the last half hour ?"
Willie said this in a cheerful voice, for to him
all seemed very bright and cheering.
" You are right, Willie, I think it must be as
you say ; Jemmie loves this beautiful, rich girl
very much; but, oh! I am so afraid it will not be
a happy thing; you mind how he speaks of her fa-
ther-I could not-no, she could not love, one
who would speak or think in this way of her fa-
ther; and don't you remember what you have
said of him? lHe must be a dreadful man, and
he would never let his child nmarry our James,
though he must think him good enough for any
body. This will make him very unhappy-poor
Jemmnie--I'm sure it will."
There did, in truth, seem great reason for anx-
iety as Wilson was ready to acknowledge, though
he had not before seen it; yet, as he told Mary, it
was not best to borrow too much trouble, for if
it was as they suspected-if James did in truth
love this child, he would not at present think of
declaring it to her ; so young as they both were-
particularly the girl-and he but just started to
work out his position in life, years at least must
pass before either one could think of marriage
seriously; and in, but one or two years what
chance for change; in four or five they might cer-
tainly hope for a much greater; in that time James
McDonald might attain to a position to make him
an object to be sought after.
Mary was not so very sanguine as to the first
part of this proposition. She knew her brother's
impatience too well in the most trivial matters
to be so very certain of his acting with such pro-
priety in so important a case; yet none could be
more hopeful than was she of her brother's future,
should nothing occur to darken his spirit-this
was what troubled her in this affair.
Very little attention was given by Wilson or his
child companion to the services at the school-
house; the mind of the latter was too much ab-
sorbed with the contents of her brother's letter
to think of anything else, while Willie was turn-
ing over and over in his mind Mary's manner of
receiving the intelligence which he had commu-
nicated. Not so much on account of the influence
this intelligence might exert over any' one inter-
ested was it that he gave the matter so much
thought, as the clear peep which the shy child had
given him of her real character, which was much
more that of a woman than a child. He smiled,
as well he might, when he remembered that he

was but two years older-in years more of a
child than Mary according to the usual compari-
sons of the world, but he felt as did every one
else that his childhood so full of trial had ex-
ercised over him a wonderfully maturing influ-
ence, and in the famliy of farmer McDonald he
knew he was regarded as the eldest among their
children; to him had been intrusted the teaching
of the younger members in many branches of
study, while no one would dream of such a thing
as James or David acting in any other capacity
than amuser or tormentor of the boys or Amy ;
and then his reading had been of that vigorous and
improving kind which had greatly aided in the
forming of his real character.
At first this solid reading had been commenced
to gratify grandma McDonald, who, as other
amusements and occupations failed her, fell back
upon what had been the delight of her girltiood--
but very soon he found in those long quiet even-
ings a double enjoyment, and when he reached
the age of sixteen he would have shamed many
a man, who counts himself learned, by his supe-
rior knowledge of history and nice taste in the
refined and poetic authors which had found their
way to the farmer's book-shelves. Had this moth-
erless boy been at heart purely sefish, he could
not have acted in a way more conducive to his
own interest, for while he had ministered to the
enjoyment and improvement of those who had be-
friended him in his sorest extremity, he had been
treasuring up knowledge which even now was
giving him a position and influence far superior
to his years-and this would be the result, almost
universally, could the young be made to consider
the happiness of those around them worth a.
small sacrifice from themselves ; but this is one
thing which can alone be taught by constant ex-
ample.
On their way home, Mary and Wilson spoke
very seriously of James, and what should be writ-
ten to him, and their conclusion was that it was
better to wait until he confided his secret to them,
ere they ventured any cautions or remonstrances.
As to his telling this Henrietta Farnham of the
interest they had all felt in her ever since that
Christmas day, neither Wilson or Mary could
see what should prevent his doing it; indeed both
concluded that they owed it to her, so much lisp-
piness as she had, through her noble dog, been
instrumental in securing to them, yet Mary could
not get rid of her anxiety when David rallied her
on her new fancy in attending the prayer meet-
ing, she found it very difficult to answer him in
any thing like her usual manner, and then the
thoughtless boy declared she was becoming Meth-

('diat, and that they should none of them be per-
mitted to speak but in just such a tone after this
But after a time, by Willie's interference, 1)avid
became interested in something besides tormnent-
ing his sister, and thed, according to the custoti
of the old school Presbyterians, with the deepen-
ing of the twilight the family began to asttnw
their week-day amusements and occupations, and
a very merry time they had of it, giving Mary a
full opportunity to recover her usually quiet
mood.
"And when are we to see you again, Willie,
my dear boy ?" asked Mrs. McDonald as th y
were about to say good night; "all wdi be in too
much of a hurry to-morrow morning to give us a
chance to say a word but good-bye, so every thng
else must be got through with to night, will yin
come home at the end of another month ? for I
am not sure that we shall not all be longing fir
'the repetition of this cheering visit long before

"And I shall 1ht g to see you, mint r, as well

from what I heard him say to one of the rolde
clerks, I am sure he wouldn't approvo of fre-
queit visits ; he said success in trade depended
more upon a willingness to apply oreselI cli wly.

"Not until Christmas !' was the exelaintiotin
which passed around the little circle, and the
tone in which it was spoken told that no one felt
over-cheerful at the prospect of so prolonged a
separation. But the old grandmother, who was
ever ready -with her word of encouragement,

difficult task, now put all the murmurers to si-

TIlE MITHER
Poor Delia, her brothers fairly shouted at such
a sudden explosion of her nice bit of romance,
and she was just on the eve of crying for vexa-
tion, when Willie came to her rescue, turning
the attention of all from the poor girl.
" Oh ! Mr. Phelps, I have a favor to ask ; it
would be impossible to bring all our family up
here; and wild as my brothers are, father and
mother would never consent to their coming to
your city home; you might almost as well intro-
duce wild colts into your parlors ; but out on our
farm, they, with Jack and Billy, would have a
chance and plenty of room to cut all the pranks
they could without disturbing anybody, or injuring
anything, and Delia would enjoy Mamy's company,
there as much as here, besides having a chance
to hear grandma tell her stories in her old fash-
ioned room, which she never can unless she goes,
there, for grandma never leaves home. Let
them all go home with me for two or three days.
I will write to mother that they are coming, and
will insure them a hearty welcome, from the oldest'
to the youngest member of our family."
And now there arose a great discussion, in
which the children took no small part; to go
they were determined, and in spite of all the ob-
jections which could be raised by their parents,
they, with Willie's help, won a promise from
their mother that, should Mrs. McDonald say she
would be willing to see them, they should go,
and Willie assured them they had nothing to fear,
he knew how cordial would be his mother's in-
vitation to the Phelps children to visit the plain
old farm home. The time was the next thing to
be settled, but that, Mrs. Phelps said, should be
left to Wilson's mother, and Delia comforted the
boys by the hint that by this arrangement they
should probably go sooner than if their mother
set the time, for the McDonald faunily would all
be in so much of a hurry to see Willie, they would
fix the earliest day possible for this journey.
Willie wrote home immediately, and the boys
declared that the week of waiting for an answer
to' his letter would never terminate, and so
troublesome were they, never for a minute still,
and continually wondering would an answer come
at all, and if they should go, what would be the
first thing the McDonald boys would say to them,
and would they prove such grand play-fellows as
they expected, with a thousand other things, un-
til their mother wished the matter decided as
soon as they could themselves.
On the morning of the very earliest day they
could, with any reason, look for the arrival of the
wished for letter, Willie caine bouniling into the
breakfast room, flourishing an open sheet and call-

LESS BAIRN.                              51
ing upon Jack and Billy to join him in three
cheers. This was the letter from Mrs. McDon-
ald, and well might her boy be proud of it. She
told how happy they were all made by the con-
tents of their dear Willie's letter, and begged him
to thank Mr. and Mrs. Phelps in hei-'s and his
father's name ; it would be such an unexpected
happiness to have their family altogether for a
whole fortnight, and it would be an increased
pleasure to have the younger members of the
Phelps family with them; she only wished the
parents could accompany their children. She had
much to say of the preparations the boys were
already making for the reception of their guests,
while Mamy and Amy were scarcely behind them,
and grandma promised some of her very best sto-
ries, and then closed by fixing the beginning of
the next week as their time for coming, as the
excitement of James' arrival would then have
passed, and if possible, she would have them there
in time to enjoy those delicious strawberries which
were this year unusually fine.
This was almost too much for the boys to en-
dure,,and Delia too was half wild with excite-
ment ;--the beginning of the next week-and
now it was Saturd sy.  But Mrs. Phelps soon
gave each one to understand there was no time
to lose, for her husband and Wilson said Tows-
day was the best day for a start and that would
leave but two days besides Sunday for the lire-
parations. And never' did the sun shine tore
beautifully than on that same Tuesday morning,
and never did a little party in their bright holi-
day smiles seem more perfectly satisfied with
their prospect, titan did the one w hich left the
handsome Phelps house to take their seats in the
cars, which would very quickly bear them to the
end of their short journey.
Mr. and Mrs. Phelps had no hesitation in
entrusting their children to Wilson's care, for al-
though he was young, he had gained such ani in-
fluence over the boys that he could control them
with less difficulty than could their parents, and
their high spirited Delia regarded him as suh a
perfect oracle of wisdom, it was for her enough j
to know that he approved o- disapyroved of liMr
actions to make her happy or wretched ; so their 1
good byes to the little traveling party were most
cheering as the bell rang the moment of departure.
"Mind, Willie, you are not to keep the11 be-

country youths and maidens, had prepared her to
have many a laugh at the expense of the McDon-
ailds ; for how young ladies could frequent the
kitchen, could delve into all the mysteries con-'
nected with cooking, butter-making, and the'
like, to say nothing of cow-milking, and still know
anything of politeness would have been a mystery
to any one of Delia's friends as it was to her;
and to see a farmer's son, with his sunburnt
cheeks, and hands brown and callous from hard
work and exposure, so gentlemanly and self-
possessed in his manners-as much at home-
when acting the polite as when holding the
plough, was a greater mystery still. Delia's city
associates, who regarded all country youths as
boors, would have wondered, as she did, how two
things so incompatible-labor and politeness-
could be practiced by any one person with such
ease, and a few days spent in the McDonald
family would have explained it to them as it did
to Delia-that what one is accustomed to from
infancy, must ever be practiced with grace-
when by sons and brothers, mother and sis-
ters are regarded as first and most deserving
among all woman kind, of their love and atten-
tion every other woman must receive from them
that delicate attention which is ever most grati-
fying to a true womanly heart. Delia was yet'
too young to arrange her newly acquired ideas,
yet had they been brought into shape, they would
have differed very little from the foregoing con-
clusion, and not in years-no, not in her whole
life did she forget this most delightful lesson ac-
quired from this first visit in a farmer's home.
After an hour's indulgence in fun,frolic and straw
berry eating, and to the Phelps children this last
'was not the least important part of the perform-
ance-by the prudent suggestion of grandma Mc-
Donald, the whole company adjourned to her
own room, where she was in truth the reigning
genius, and where by one of her most entertain-
ing and instructive stories, she subdued the mad
spirits of the younger portion of the family into
a most quiet listening mood. Even her own
children, who had spent so manydelightful hours
listening to her never failing stories, listened this
evening with an interest they had seldom felt,
and Delia thought it was no wonder this family
were happy, the possessors, as they were, of
such a living story book; and at last she settled
the question which had greatly puzzled her, that
could she choose from the treasures of this home
which would she take ? Grandma was certainly
the one most to be coveted, and long after she was
in bed she was livig over the events of the day-
the most delightful day that in all her short life

she could remember having spent. She would
have said before this, that a man must lose his
importance if he would condescend to mingle
with children in their sports, yet when had she
ever seen a father more respected by his children
than was this farmer, who had entered with such
real enjoyment into the amusements of the day-
and mother and grand-mother, although they gave
themselves up so entirely to the amusing of their
children, not hesitating to play to perfection the
part assigned them, not for a moment did even
the wild Archie or Ronald' lose sight of that
deferential love which characterized their man-
ner towards these two.
Delia had seen this, yet it was one thing, she
could not quite understand; with girls she would
not have been surprised perhaps that such man-
agement should work well; but with harum sea-
rum boys-that was what puzzled her, and yet
she had not failed to observe that her own not
over civil brothers had never behaved with such
praiseworthy propriety as on this evening.
The cause of this might have puzzled older
heads than Delia's, for very few parents learn in
the whole course of training their children the
thousand opportunities they let slip of improving
and influencing those so dear to them, to say
nothing of giving them greater enjoyment -and
securing to themselves a greater-by neglecting
to mingle with and assist them in their childish
pleasures. They seem not to realise that as a
child behaves in the play ground or in the play
room towards his or her associates, so, with
scarcely an exception, must they act towards
those with whom they come in contact when they
shall come to fill the position of men and women,
and in this great school for forming not only
mind and manner, but heart too, these tender un-
trained beings are left without a guide; and
who canwonder, that the end is too often soul
sickening-may we not rather wonder that any
escape the polluting touch of vice? When wo-
men. and men, too, learn that the most noble
thing they can do in this bfe is to watch over
with tenderness and wisdom that richest gift
which heaven can bestow upon earth's children-
their offspring-when in their griefs, their studies,
their amusements they come to join as sympa-
thizers, helpers, and participators, then and only
then must there be a falling off from dram shops
and gambling houses, and then may we hope to
have penitentiaries and poor houses unoccupied.
But Delia's thoughts were nothing of the sort,
but such as, under the circumstances, might have
occupied any otherflfteen year old girl-wishing
that her own dear mother did not so easily tire of

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.

talking with her, of answering her questions and
assisting her in her studies, and that for once in
her life she could see both her parents playing
the child, as she had seen it played by the digni-
fied farmer and his wife on this delightful even-
ing.
During their three days' stay, there was no
falling off of enjoyment with these city children,
but when Saturday morning arrived, and Wilson
told them they must, during the forenoon, take
their last draught of country enjoyment, for at
noon they were to take the cars home, which was
in accordance with their mother's wish, no one
uttered a word of murmuring ; in truth, they
looked to the going home with anticipated pleas-
ure-their visit had been so delightful, so full of
novelties, would there not be enough to talk
about for- a whole week ?
When Wilson prepared to accompany them to
the city, they all begged of him to send them
alone and not for their sakes deprive himself of a
half day of his delightful fortnight at home. The
youth was much gratified by this unexpected
thoughtfulness on the part of the boys, but he had
no chance to thank them, for David broke in up-
on their couheil, making the declaration that he
had made up an independent etrawberrying par-
ty-as yet, it was composed of hhnself alone, but
volunteers would be received with equal pleas-
ure. And not many minutes was it before the
gay young farmer had the satisfaction of piling
brothers, sisters and guests all into the lumber
wagon, for weie they to walk, he said, nobody
would do anything but eat as fast as they should
gather the berries when they reached the mea-
dow, and his object in the expedition was quite
a different one. He wished to give the mother of
their young visiters a taste of their country luxu-
ries; the berries they should gather were to be
his offering to Mrs. Phelps, and until their largest
basket was filled, no one of the company was to
be allowed to regale him or herself with even a
single taste, no matter how tempting they might
be.
Delia and her brothers were too much grati
fled with this arrangement, not to practise this
self-denial while with the rest. David was look-
ed upon as having a right to direct, being chief
originator of the party, so no one thought of act-
ing contrary to his commands; but formidable as
was the designated basket for size, with such a
numerous party and berries so plentiful, not a
very long time was consumed in filling it to the
brim, and then Delia and Amy went on heaping
it up with the most beautiful clusters they could
select, until there was not room for another one ;

59

then there came the closing up merry making
time, in which all joined right gleefully, and it
was only broken off by Willie reminding them
that they were to get back home for lunch, and
then there would be no more than time for their
travelers to reach the village before car time.
They found Mrs. McDonald waiting their re-
turn with table spread ; and the mingled perfume
of coffee and short cake told she had not firgot-
ten her part of the engagement. Mary and Amy
assisted by Delia, soon had a sufficiency of ber-
ries prepared to fill the rich, smoking short cake,
and as it was placed upon the table, floating in
delicious cream and juice, the rustic party ac-
knowledged themselves fully prepared to test its
merits, by gathering around the table in the most
unceremonious manner, for all having been pre-
pared for them they felt themselves at liberty to
dispense with all order.
To David's appeal, if, after all, the country
was not much to be preferred to the city--especial-
ly country lunches to city lunches-Delia, like a
cautious child, answered,
"If all of the country was like what she had
seen, and all the city what it appeared to her,
surely the country must be the best beyond com-
parison. But to her all seemed too fairy-like to
last; she was not convinced of its reality yet."a
" But don't we seem a remarkably robust race
of fairies, Delia? The way we've all pitched
into that stock of strawberry short cake would
seem to ine sufficient to convince you of our tan-
gibility. Fairy-like, you call this do you? Well
if we don't have real life and real enjoyment here,
I don't know where you will find it!"
"That is what made me say it seems like
fairy-land, for you know we think that the nicest
place in the world ! you all look so kind and
happy here, you would make every one else sa.
I don't believe I was ever so long a time without
feeling a little cross, and Jack and Billy have
been se different from what they are at home-
Willie will tell you so," she added, as they ill
laughed at her frank way of speaking of herself
and brothers.
" And do you bring this up as an argument
against the country, Delia ?"  asked  David
roguishly.
" Oh ! no, you know I do not"-was the girl's
answer, not seeming to notice that the youth was
laughing at her-"but all has been too pleasant
to last-that was why I pronounced it unreal !"
"But I can testify that it has lasted these nine-
teen years, Delia, and if that is'nt sufficient, that
youngster at your side will tell you he has grown
to maii's estate-for lie plumes himself on his one0

The flash of thoughtfulness, which for a mo-
ment was stealing over all the company, flitted
before this boyish speech, and all laughed at the
lad's thorough appreciation of their repast, quite
forgetful of David's unusually serious moods.
The Phelps children were accompanied by all
the younger McDonalds, as well as by David and
Willie ; James alone being left out of the com-
pany. The good byes of Mr. and Mrs. McDonald
and grandma were such as their visit had given
them reason to expect, and the invitation from all
three to repeat the visit in the fall, when the nuts
were in their most inviting mood, asking, as the
farmer said, to be gathered, filled all their young,
heads with the brightest imaginable dreams of
another delightful time. And then such pleasant
messages as they had for their parents, not only
to allow their children to come to them, but to
come themselves and get a taste of the country
life ; all this convinced the Phelps party that
never before were there people, so good and
thoughtful of children as Mr. McDonald, his wife,
and that charming grandmother.
Their ride to the village in the lumber wagon
was all taken up in plans for the McDonalds to
come to them, and have a taste of sight-seeing.
The boys felt particularly how little they had to
offer in the way of entertainment to their young
friends, but then they would do the best they
could, and at least they could talk over all that
had been so nice during their stay in the coun-
try. But to Archie and Ronald it looked a very
different thing-a visit to the city would be a

place among her children, and to their natural'
inquiries after her health, the answer was what

not to be decived, and as his visit came near its
close, his close watching of every movement had
convinced him all was not right, and he resolved
to tell his kindest of mothers what were his
fears, and find if they had any foundation.
Not until the evening before he must return to
the city did he find a favorable opportunity to
speak freely with the object of his solicitude. Mr.
McDonald being engaged with a neighbor, who
had called to spend an hour or two, and the chil-
dren wholly occupied with a game in the garden,
while James and David were absorbed in listen-
ing to Mary's reading of an interesting book,
there seemed little danger of his being disturbed
by any of them, if he sought the mother's roi-
where at twilight, she was nearly always to be
found. As Wilson approached the door, which
was ajar, he saw the occupant of the room sit-
ing by the window, her head bowed, and her thin
face partially concealed by one hand, upon vxhich
her forehead was resting ; by the twilight that
face looked paler and thinner than he had ever
seen it, and the expression upon it was that of
exceeding sadness. For a moment he hesitated,
feeling he hardly had a right to disturb her reflec-
tions ; then his anxiety, which was not at all les-
sened by her look, gave him courage, and his gen.

CHATER IX.
"Our very hopes belied our fears,
our fears our hopes belied.
We thought h,.r dying when she slept,
And sleeping when she died. HooD.
To a disinterested looker on, Mrs. McDonald's
fears might have seemed almost groundless. For
many weeks, even months, she kept her place in
her family, as was her wont, and then, little by
little, this careful wife and mother was compelled
to yield to her growing feebleness-to give up to
less practiced hands t ose little duties she had
so delighted in, until ere she, or those who loved
her so truly were hardly conscious of it, the ac-
tive housewife, was completely lost in- the con-
firmed invalid.
April found her able to do little more than
walk with great difficulty from her bed to the
easy chair in which she found relief front her
weariness ; but still the family had not yet arous-
ed to a consciousness of the sorrow which was
overshadowing them, the summer they thought
would bring with it strength for that feeble one,
and the smile, with which the sufferer heard
these hopeful words, reassured their anxious
hearts. But in all this time Mrs. McDonald had
found much real comfort and strength in unbur-
thening her tried soul to the child of her adop-
tion ; no pain was concealed from him, and had
she not known him so well, she might have be-
lieved that the steady cheerfulness he was ever
able to preserve in the presence of the other
members of the family, and the quiet comfort
he could ever speak to her when they were alone,
came from indifference; but the long years, dur-
ing which they had lived in that closest relation
as other and child, had given her a thorough
knowledge of the strength of Wilson's love for
her; yet one thing she had not learned, and there
seemed little chance of her ever finding it out-
the strength of that boy heart, its ability to for-
get self in comforting those who were dear to
it-or if not forget-to suppress the cry which
his agonized soul was struggling to utter, and
instead to whisper calm loving words of comf rt.
Could this mother have had Wilson with her
constantly, it would have served greatly to les-
sen the weariness attending this gradual wearing
out; but this she would not ask, for with his em-
ployer he had grown to be a most t ffieient clerk,
not only on account of his activity, but for the
studied care he had ever shown in all that he had
lain his hand to. Mr. Phelps had gained the
greatest confidence in him, and often intrusted
him with commissions, or talked with him on-
business matters in a way he would not have
done with his oldest and most reliable clerks.

Knowing all this Mrs. McDonald would not have
consented to Wilson's futtire prospects being sa-
crificed to gratify her, for in all probability, when
the boy should reach his majority, if not before,
he would be entered as partner in the large mer-
cantile establishment; and she looked upon his
unequalled success, which she well knew was
owing to his own honest and active service, with
all a mother's pride-but in this pride how much
was-there of sadness.
When others, to whom he was dear, should be
looking upon the prosperity of not only this child,
butherother children,when they should rejoice to-
gether over the good things life might bring, or per-
chance weep together over the sorrows which
might lay before them-she should be beyond all.
sorrow or joy, so far as earth and her dear ones
were tosbe thought of-should be'still and silent in
the grave, that resting place, seeming to mortal
mind, colder and more dismal the more nearly ap-
proached, and which, so long as an heart-tie re-
mains in life, no Christian faith can rob of its
gloom,     .
Mr. Phelps had heard from Wilson of his moth-
er's feeble health, and without being asked, had
granted him a two days' visit home each month.
This was indeed a great kindness, and not only
the boy, but Mrs. McDonald felt it so, and neither
one thought of asking more, yet the separations al-
.ways cost them both a pang, for when Wilson was
gone the invalid must shut her secret within her
own heart, and very often her mournful thoughts
would become almost unbearable. Yetoften as she
tried to break the sad truth to her husband and
children, her courage would always fail her, and
when the words were almost spoken, again they
would be recalled. Thus shut out from opening
her heart to all the others, was it strange that
this sinking woman had grown to lean so confid-
ingly upon the boy, who despite the absence of a
natural tie, had gained a child's place in the
motherly heart.
"Good-bye, mother, I must go now, but Mr.
Phelps told me I should come to stay a long two
weeks with you as soon as we should complete
the invoice of the stock now preparing for be-
ing shipped.-Two weeks !-how much I shall
enjoy such a long visit !"
Wilson took the thin white handle of his mother
within his own as he said this, and his words
were spoken in a very cheerful tone, for David
was standing by waiting to have the good-byes
over that he could take his brother to the depot;

in labor of any kind, that she had not an ear for
what was spoken by her worshipped mother; this
Wilson well knew, and had assumed a manner so
foreign to his real feelings, for his last two or
three home visits had shown the object of his
anxiety declining much more rapidly than at any
time before, and from all that he had heard of
the progress of this stealthy disease, the very
symptoms over which all felt so rejoiced-the ab-
sence of pain-was the one which spoke the most
plainly of a rapid dissolution. Convinced of all
this, it was not -pos-ible for him to think of a
home visit two or three weeks hence with other
than a sad heart, sometimes it was with heart-
rending forebodings, yet for the sake of all those
dearer 'than his own life he could hide
this, and seem happy as in the days when all had
been sunshine.
Mrs. McDonald found it less easy to assume
what she so little felt, and her tone was really
mournful in which she said:
"Mr. Phelps is very kind, Willie-very thought-
ful-but how long before this business will be
done with-not too long I hope''
"Not more than three weeks, dear mother;
that will be soon gone, and I shall then have more
than a chance to say 'how do you do,' before the
'good bye'must come."
"And three weeks are longer than two, Willie;
it looks very long to me, for there may come
much suffering and sorrow in that time"-the
voice was choked with emotion.
Mary arose quickly and came to her mother;
her young face was troubled, and the hand which
she laid upon her parent's forehead was cold from
nervousness; but she made no attempt to speak
save with her sorrowful eyes, which told her fos-
ter brother the truth was dawning upon her ; as
to David, he could see no reason for such gloomy
apprehensions; full of health and vigor, and hope
himself, life must look very fair, and his manner
was very gay as he said:
"Tut, tut ! mother, nervous are you! This be-
ing cooped up here is too much for almost any-
body, but who would have thought of your going
out? Come, now, cheer up, the sun is warm to-
day; in ihree or four days we shan't be afraid to
take you out, and then you'll get strong, and
these cheeks will grow like themselves again."
He patted one of her cheeks playfully as he said
this, but neither his words or manner had any
power to cheer her heart or even to awaken a
shown of cheerfulness.
These cheeks will never be more like themselves
than you see them now, Davie; you may take
me out, but the change will bring no strength to

my wasted limbs. No,you need not look doubt-
ful, my dear boy, I am not nervous-as you Say-
but I know my life is almost spent, I have ft It it
for a long time going from me very gradually, but
very surely; but now that I have so little way to
travel ere I come to the end, it seems to mue I un
speeding over it so swiftly-yes, too swiftly, for
even feeble as I am, there is a pleasure in staying
with you all-there, there my darling, my poor
Mary, hush! now I would not have spoken yet,
but I have put it off as long as I dare ;-dt't
cry so bitterly, my child."
Mary had sunk upon her knees by her moth-
er's side, and with her head bowed upon the ari
of the chair, she was weeping as one nearly be-
reft of hope; her sobs were not loud but deep and
passionate. Her mother's words and caresses
had little power to soothe her, but only brought
home to that young heart-before untried in sor-
rdw-the conviction that she soon should be left
motherless! motherless !!
As to the happy light-hearted David, there
seemed something in the words of his other
which bewildered him; his manner was as ore
who did not comprehend, but with one hand
upon his brow he stood half bending over the
speaker, his eyes fixed upon that loved face as
though he would read her very heart and know
all its sad secrets; after a moment spent in trypnig
to soothe Mary, the mother went on,
"I have shut this in my heart very long, none
but Willie, our faithful Willie-has fathtmed toy
secret; and not even now  would I have spoken
had all my children been with me ; but the 1.h au
few days have told me, that what you have all
hoped so much from the warm sunshine andtitm
mer air will but hasten the day of sorrow ; ny
strength has gone much more rapidly during the
last two days, than in a whole week before, and
I can't be blinded to my fate  Biut, David, I muiit

must be told of this; oh ! my children, how can I

have been our lives-so tender as he has ever
been, how can I lookt upoin his agony ; and yet hi
must know it-very soon, even it' I seal my lips,
he will learn all in the saddest, saddest way."
"IHush, mother, don't let a thought of it'e
who-are well and strong-who are so well able
to bear, compared with you-overcome you so
much. We are all helped in our grief-we are
all given strength according to our affliction."
Willie said this in such a low soothing voice,
it could not fail to calm the mother's agitation

somewhat. When she seemed a little more quiet
he went on:
"Mother, shall I talk to father ?  I know he
has many fears, yet he believes you will be spar-
ed to us; it is hard for any of us to believe in the
coming of a first grief, we think som thing will
turn the destroyer from our doors, yet for all this
our circles are broken. Mother, shall I wait un-
til evening, and save you as much as I may from
this trial?"
Wilson spoke with much feeling, and much
more like a full grown man than a youth of seven-
teen years. The answer was almost a wail of
sorrow.
" Do, Willie-arid, oh! do not go until this is
over. My poor David, my poor husband! but
for this I could endure the trial."
All three of the children seemed overcome by
the scene. David, who until this moment had
kept his half bent position, now sank into a chair
and burying his face in his hands, the poor fel-
low groaned aloud. Wilson alone had even the
appearance of composure, but even he dared not
venture the first word for some moments. When
at length he felt his voice might be trusted, he
said
"Now, dear mother, for your own sake as
well as ours, and mother, for father's sake you
must lie down, you must get quiet, for (ne that
is strong soon sinks under such agitation-and
you know how very little you can endure. You
would stay with us for a while, dearest mother ;
I know how you long to see our brother, but you
must be caretul of your strength-the little you
have must be used with great caution, . or it
won't hold out."
While he was saying this the boy passed his
hand over the brow and down the side of the
mother's face in the most gentle loving way ;
that touch told how much of love there was in
his heart for the sufferer, although he could so
entirely lose sight of his own share in the grief,
it was not that his share was a small one, but
that he loved this mother, so unselfishly. After
a little the invalid laid her head back in her
chair, and closed her eyes as if to rest, Wilson
went quietly to his brother's side, and laying his
hand upon his shoulder he said in a low voice,
"David, my poor brother, come; we must not
think of our part in this sorrow-for father's and
mother's sakes let us not seem to grieve! "
"Seem not to grieve!" exclaimed David with
vehemence--"seem not to grieve!! and can you
who have shared our home and her love say that,
Willie; seem not to grieve! Oh, yes, I can see
it is not with you as was she your mother; but,

Wilson, can't you recall the time when it was
your own mother who was going, and then can
you not pity me?"
The young man spoke almost bitterly, but his
words seemed to have no other effect upon him
to whom they were addressed, than to excite his
alarm lest they should agitate their mother.
"Hush, hush, my poor fellow; yes, I do pity
you, and David I know how to pity one who
suffers, but mother must be quiet now; let us go
out and leave her to Mamy's care, and may be she
will get a little sleep; we can trust her with
Matny-comne, Davie, will you not come with me?"
ie spoke in such a kind, persuasive tone, the
yoang man arose to go with him.
"Yes, go with him, my poor Davie," said
Mrs. McDonild, in a voice much calmer than
when she had last spoken. "If you could know
all that he has been to me, you would not say
again what you just now said-though you are
right he has none of my weakness of heart-he
is not my child by the flesh, nor is he your
brother, but by the love he bears us he is ours
doubly. Oh, so truly ours-he will make you
stronger as he has made me; listen to him, my boy,
and he will teach you submission as he has
taught it to me, and if you can follow the ex-
ample he sets us all-though this is very hard-you
will be a living comfort to all you hold dear!
Little did I dream on that Christmas day, so many
years ago, when your father brought him a home-
less, motherless, child to our house, that he could
prove to us such a blessing. Go with him, Davie ;
kiss me first and then go away; he will do you
good, besides I would have some rest. Willie is
right. I must be very careful of my remaining
strength would I stay until James can arrive."
David had no voice to reply, to him this was
a, fearful shock, so sudden he scarcely knew
whether he waked or slept. One kiss he press-
upon those colorless lips and then followed Wilson
from the room. As to Maryher adopted brother
had.been right in what he had said of her, their
mother was to be trusted in her care. No sooner
were the two left alone, than the young girl
raised her head, revealing her thin face sorrow
stamped, but still wearing the expression of de-
termined calmness. Although the child had sob-
bed so heavily, there were no traces of tears upon
her cheeks, and her eyes in their sorrowful look
the mother thought larger and clearer than she
had ever before seen them.
" I will lay down, my child-place the pillows
very high, for I find it difficult to breathe; I would
get rested for I am tired, and your father will be
in soon."

While she was speaking her companion ap-

thing in the very attitude which alarmed him;
his hand was laid upon one of those colorless as

and lifeless as clay. Mary saw the movement and

she knew that she-that they were motherless.
But where death had stolen in so quietly, was it
not meet that the mourning should be of a quiet
nature?

was to her only child-how he looked up to her
as a second self; and it was not strange that her
old heart's fibres had wound themselves about
this younger one so closely. That now when
they were torn away she almost longed for death
to free her from a life whieh seemed all so deso-
late. Yet there might be something for her to
do-this stricken family might now require the
aid of these old hands which had so long appear-
ed so useless, and she prayed for patience to en-
dure, if yet there was the smallest thing remain-
ing for her to accomplish in life.
To farmer McDonald the shock was overpow-

ed uron God for strength and wisdom to aid him;
but now, when he most needed Divine support, he
sank down upon his own weakness, forgetting
that the hand which had been outstretched to
afflict could also pour the soothing balm into the
bleeding heart.
There was one other pair of eyes in that house-
hold unvisited by sleep-that aged mother's,
dimmed by nearly four score years ; yet they were
not too old to watch when a child-her only one
was wrestling in such sore agony ; but she knew
well his was not a grief to be reached by hurin
comfort, and christian-like she used her only
available means, prayer; but tramp, tramp, sound-
ed the mourner's step save when for a momiient
he would pause by the bed of death to gaze upon
all that remwaied to him of what he liad so
fondly worshipped ; and day brought with it
no change.
The funeral was like many another one. The
dead was laid away to rest until that great di)
of awxxakeninig, and many a curious looker on pro-
nounced the children almost heartless that they
could witness the burial of such a mother wit i
such hushed grievings. Little did they dream,
that for the time their grief for the dead was al-
most forgotten, or at least for the moment cast
aside in their anxiety for~ the liig ; so it was
with the elder ones, and the younger, as is so
natural, followed the example set therem-simoth-
ering their sobs which swelled their childish
hearts.
Not until the second day after the funeral did
Wilson feel it possible to tear himself from his,
home to return to the cty. A messenger had
been sent to Mr. Phelps, the afternoon following
Mrs. McDonald's death, to tell hun of the cause
of the youth's detention, and the answer which
die merchant had returned was most expressive
of sympathy ; yet ha could expect, in such a
busy time, a business man-no matter how kind
hearted-would think it unreasonable that too
much time should be consumned in abandon-
ed  grieving; and Wilson's better judgment
told him that, instead of doing them good,
this silent sympathy was creating a morbid
melancholy within all their minds, and this
diversion might do them much service ; for not
only Mary and David, but the younger children,
cried out against his leaving them at such a time,
and even Mr. McDonald and his mother raised
a faint remonstrance, when they heard of his de-
termination to go back to his employer. The
farmer seemed surprised that any one should
tbink of business ; ho had felt this was a death
which should drape the whole world in mourn-

turn his ined to his labors again seemed the un-
happy man's first recollection that his was not
an universal source of affliction-that still there
was buying and selling to be done-that inn
looked upon this death, which had so crushed
his heart, as lee lead1 looked upon the thousandesee
and thousands that had gone before it ; yet for
himself and his family all ambition was dead-
buried in that grave which had received thee heolpe

he might be freed from life wx which had become a

cause.                                      h
" You surprise me, Mr.Farnham, in taking such
a decided stand in this case; matters of thiskind t
you have ever before left to me entirely, and now
you seem more than half inclined not to give me j
even a voice in deciding as to the guilt or inno- j
cence of this boy, who, let him be what he mayc
now, I shall ever believe care to me with an s
honest heart."
"It may be to you surprising, Mr. Phelps, that t
I ever presume 'to have a voice in my own af-
fairs"-the manner was cold and expressive of,
displeasure-"but although I have interfered so E
little since we were associated, I don't consider
that this non-interference has annulled my rightI
to Epeak, when I see a want of sober judgment
in the conducting of the affairs; you must excuse
rue for saying this, but you are guilty of a womanly
weakness, so far as this youth is concerned. I
am the last one to be over-severe, but our inter-
ests are endangered by allowing him to remain in
his place, and justice demands that such a thing
should not be passed over without attention; if
we forego a public investigation, we certainly
should not a private. In consideration of his ex-
treme youth, an i his family-w.hich you say are
very respectable-I am inclined to allow justice
to yield much to mercy; but he must know this is
all discovered!
For a few moments Mr. Phelps remained silent
and his face was very sober; then he said, "You
may be in the right, Farnbarn; you are an older
man than I, and have seen more of the world; 1
suppose I ought to yield to you with a better
grace, but it is very hard for me to believe one
who has ever seemed so nearly perfect, so very
false; and just at this time, too-I could have a
little more courage if the boy had no trouble
upon his mind; but it is not a light matter to
bring up an affair of this kind when his heart is
well nigh crushed, for, let you say or think what
you may, I know he was most devoted to his
mother, and there is a chance of its not being
true; don't you think it cruel to accuse at such a
time on uncertainties?"
There was something like a smile upon the face
of Mr. Farnham, as he answered, "The boy
must be a very good actor; I don't doubt but that
he is; to some it is more natural and much easier
to seem than to be ! One who could act the
honest so as to so thoroughly deceive a man of

usiness, all the time practising the accomplished
ogue, could, I presume, make himself appear a
most devoted son. I trust no one, sir, no one,
until I have tried them in every way. Let us be-
ieve every man, woman and child evil until we
have proved them good!"
There was much of bitterness in the words and
one of the speaker.
" I don't like that doctrine, Farnham ; I would
udge mankind more by myself. No, no, let us-
udge the hearts of our fellows by the hearts we
carry within our own bosoms-oven that may be
evere enough."
" May be you think I do, Phelps; may be you
think I judge in this way, that I am so severe."
and the speaker gave a bitter laugh.
Before his companion had time to answer, a
slight confusion outside the counting room made
them both look through the widow, and the
hind-hearted Mr. Phelps saw with regret the ob-
ject of their slight disagreement receiving the
greetings of the other clerks in the store ; but
without lingering among them for a moment he
was making his way towards the counting room,
where for the last few months he had been nearly
the whole time occupied in a way which told he
possessed the entire confidence of Mr. Phelps at
least. His manner was anything but expressive
of .  consciousness of having betrayed a trust con-
fided in him, as he entered the little room where
the two gentlemen were sitting.
Mr. Phelps arose to receive him, and in spite
of all that had passed he felt his heart yearn-
ing towards the youth, who now. stood accused
of robbing him,-and what seemed so very
strange, it had not been to benefit himself, but
to satisfy the extravagance and dissipation of his
employer's son, one, who by his disobedience and
waywardness had forfeited the affection of even
his parents. As to Wilson, he saw nothing pe-
c liar in Mr. Phelps' manner, and when he had
for a moment hesitated to enter, on discovering
the room occupied by more than one, the voice
was only a little subdued in which he had been
bidden to "comein."
" I have staid longer than was right, perhaps,
Mr. Phelps," he said ; "but I felt you would over-
look it at this time.".
The answer was to the effect that even now
he did not expect him back-he might have ad-
ded he could wish he had not come-and as he
spoke in a half hesitating way, he stole a glance
at Mr. Farnham, who was still seated by the ta-.
ble. Wilson naturally followed the direction of
the glance, and he started very perceptibly ; at
first the face had been turned away from him

speaker designed it should be-cold and stern.
"What-can I say, Mr. Phelps? you know my

see how nearly that resembles it ; had I not readI
what is written, I could have taken my oath that
I wrote it-though God is my witness, my eyes
never before rested upon one word traced there."
The tone in which this was spoken was clear,
and to Mr. Phelps' heart his words seemed con-
vincing, yet, as Wilson had said himself, he would
take his oath the writing was no other than his,
and so he told the poor boy. This was more than
Wilson had looked for-it had seemed to him as
impossible that his employer could believe him
guilty of this, as that he should believe it himself.
For a few moments he struggled with his shame
'r,d anguish, and then bowing his face in his
hands he wept silently over this wrong, and in his
heart he prayed for death, that this sorrow and
disgrace might be lost in forgetfulness.
CHAPTER XI.
"To fly from, need not be to hate mankind."-tBYRoN.
"'Labor is worsip!' The robin is singing;
'Labor is worship ! The wild bee is ringing;
Listen! That eliegnent whisper npspriogiog,
Speaks to thy soui from out nature's great heart"
[OGonoD.
On one of those vast fields of the West which
nature has so kindly prepared for the industrious
husbandman, embowered within a clump of smell
trees and shrubbery, nestled a small hut which
bore evident marks of being not only a human
habitation, but of its occupant or occupants, who-
ever he or they might be, having a thorough ac-
quaintance with refined as well as civilized life.
Not but that it was rough enough, being built
p irtly of stone, partly ofclay, while here and there
wais to be seen an unhewn beama of wood, serv-
ing apparently as a sort of frame work, yet to one
acquainted with Western life, as well asWestern
architecture, this structure declared the hands
which had fashioned it possessed of no small
share of industry and cleverness, for save three
or four windows, composed of a single pane of
glass each, in the external of the little dwelling
there were no evidences of foreign manufacture.
The planks from which the doors had been man-
ufactured had never known the benefit of plane or
even saw; although done with extreme nicety, it
wis clear that the degree of smoothness which
they possessed had been procured by the use of
no other utensil than the common axe, while the
enineys, three in number, which were built two
feet, at least, abteve the roof, were fashioned of
rieugh fragments of stone and clay.

For all this primitiveness, there was something
in the form and the very air of the dwelling and
its surroundings, which declared that no common
mind or taste had been occupied in planning and
arranging every thing. Even in the choice of the
spot, there was expressed.a love of the beautiful,
which would have made one wish to see the pro-
prietor of the little domicile, as well as the hun-
dreds, one- might almost say thousands of acres
of magnificent land which surrounded it. With
the refinement manifest in all which had been
done here, what could have driven'the possessor
of all this to seek such hermitage, scores of miles
away from any human habitation, and hundreds
of miles distant front civilization? Near enough
to the cottage, that the murmuring of its clear
waters sounded as a soothing music, flowed a
beautiful river, bordered by the graceful willow,
interwoven with here and there a flowering
shrub which had floated down upon the stream,
and, lodging among the overhanging willows, had
taken root, and in their new hom flourished as
if they had known no other.
But these were not the only flowers which bar-
thened tie air with their rich perfume. Trailing
rose bushes clambered up the rough walls of the
cottage until they crept along the very eaves;
the.wild jassamine, too, was there, mingling its
sweet breath with its floral compare ion, and doing
more than could any art to beautify the rough
dwelling, while all was inclosed by a hedge form-
ed of the wild gooseberry and raspberry bushes.
which in their season furnished an abundance of
delicious fruit as a reward to whoever kept and
triramed them with such care. A larger bed of
wild strawberries, greatly improved, as must be
nearly everything by contact with civilization and-
cultivation, were even now ripening in the warm
June sun, telling of princely feasts to be enjoyed
there. But a few rods distant the young corn was
waving to the soft warm breeze, while peas,
beans, potatoes, and many other kinds of vegeta-
bles were thriving in that manner which told of
no common care. Small patches of grain, too,
testified of the richness of the soil, but in their
laying out they seemed more the work of a
gardener than of afarmer, firtheir size was so di-
minutive they seemed to promise very little to-
wards the support of whoever had thus nicely
cared for them.
In an opposite direction from  the little em-
bowery were the only animate objects to be seen
around the dwelling-a half dozen sleek, happy,
looking goats were feeding, quite content appa-
rently with the fresh, tender grass which was
growing in such abundance around them, ad,

To take in at a hasty glance all these objects

but as he leaned upon his heavy walking stick,
there was about him an air of weariness which
spoke of a long journey, and his person as'well
as his clothing told of some days' absence freun
the civilized world, and in t he expression of his
sunburnt face there was a half mournful  eager-
ness not usually seen in an aimless wanderer-a
desire to go a little further-to take another step,
even a frantic longing for it, but with that long-
ing a fear to move lest some hope, too long cher-
ished, should be in a moment crushed.   Sud-

THE MITHERLESS BAIRN.

and when her husband insisted upon his having
been a most reliable man, accusing her of a lack
of womanly feeling, in thus suspecting him of
anything wrong, now that be was beyond defend-
ing himself, she told him she had never shared
with him the confidence he had felt in his part-
ner; she made no pretensions of believing their
son less guilty than his father was inclined to
thiak him, but, until they had made an examina-
tion of Carson's papers, she would not be con-
vinced the boy was alone in guilt. Her woman's
perception, served her better in this case than
did her husband's sounder judgment, as he was
himself compelled to acknowledge when the cor-
respondence between the two villains--the whole,
for three years, was brought to light.
"Then it was that we learned all about the
part that these two had acted towards you, Wil-
lie! Carson, in his caution, had requested the re-
turn of his letters, and all, save two or three,
were found in his possession; these two or three
Phelps had kept to witness against the fellow, in
case he proved unmanageable. But they were
scarcely needed, for the contents of threatening
letters, afterwards written, gave us a pretty good
idea of all they contained. Their whole plan for
la3 ing you under suspicion was divulged, and
their rejoicing over the success of their scheme
was such as you might expect.
" Mr. Phelps did not wait an unnecessary hour'
after this discovery was made before he put a
clear statement of the whole affair into the hands
of the editor of that paper, and he made no ef-
fort to spare his son, or conceal his part in the
criminal matter. Neither did he spare his money,
Willie, but sent notices and advertisements to
papers in all parts of our country, paying liber-
ally, and offering extravagant reward for the
smallest information of you ; but a year passed,
and no tidings cane. Then all were agreed that
our only hope of finding you was for me to start
out, and never give up the search until I had dis-
covered your whereabouts. It has been a long
journey, Willie, a very long journey. I have
traveled over thousands of miles, North and
South, East and West; many a time, as in this
ease, hearing of some strange man dwelling in
solitude, I have turned in my course and gone
hundreds of miles, but to meet with disappoint-
ment. This has happened again and again, until
I had grown to expect it-or if not to expect it-
for my hope of finding you was strong as ever-
I was prepared to find at the end of my jaunt a
surly, perhaps a grizzly bearded, half civilized
being, instead of such an one as had been do-

scribed to me, and given us small grounds for hop-
ing to find you.
"It was with this feeling I followed the path
indicated by a rough hunter, more than five hun-
dred miles away from here, Wilson. It has been
a great tramp, and at last I have my reward-at
last my brother is found, and I can rest."
Desponding as had been Wilson Harley when
his companion commenced    speaking -wholly
bereft of hope as he had seemed, he very soon be-
came a most attentive listener, and through the
whole narration, he made no attempt at an in-
terruption, by question or exclamation. But
the change which gradually came over his face
showed that however hapless he might have been
the account was too clear and convincing for
even his despair to withstand, and when David
crame to the closing up of the story, illustrating
the last exclamation by seating himself in the cu-
riously constructed, but very comfortable arm
chair which his companion had abandoned on his
approach to the door, Wilson himself arose,
walked hastily across the room two or three
times, then stepped out into the freshening air,
brushing the heavy hair from his forehead to al-
low the breeze to fan his fevered brow! David
would rot interrupt him, for, judging from his
movements he believed the poor fellow was try-
ing to decide whether he slept, or was really
awake--whether those tidings were indeed a
glad truth, or but a dream to be in one little mo-
ment dispelled,.and his solitude be rendered more
unbearable that it had been believed, at an end.
At last coming back into the house, he grasped
the hands of his brother and said in a very trem-
bling voice:
"David, I have not deserved all this devotion-
you have acted more than a brotherly part, but
now I cannot speak of it: I believe-no, it can-
not be a dream, no dream could seem soreal-
my heart begins to open to receive the great joy,
but my banishment from real gladness has been
so long an one, we must wait a little--wait a
little till I become accustomed to this wonderful
change."
"Amid until you put it in my power to break my
fast, which has lasted since a very early hour
this morning, and from which I begin to feel
symptoms'not in the least enviable," exclaimed
David in a gay -tone.
The little speech had the desired effect upon
Wilson. His thoughts so suddenly turned from
himself to the necessities of one who had done
for him more than a brother's duty, in a mao-
ment he seemed inspired with all the life and ef-
ficiency of a real host.

TIIE MITILERL
"Ah! yes David-yes, yes,, how thoughtless Il
have been-you look faint and exhausted. Be-c
fore I can go about your dinner to prepare it, I1
must get you something to refresh yourself with
ntil it is ready."
Quickly he disappeared through a side opening
in the room, and after a few moments' absence
returning, said : "Come Davie, a wash after your
long walk will do much towards resting you, and
time will pass more quickly too if you are doing
something, for, although I have all that one can
wish in the way of provision, it requires cook-
i'ng, which you have not forgotten must take a
ittle time!"
As he spoke, he led the way into an inner room
from which was a door opening out upon the
river. David looked around him with perfect
astonishment. Here was a bed having a most in-
viting and comfortable look to a weary man.
Two or threo'chairs, quaint enough in their fash-
ioning, and upholstered with, deer-skin, were
sitting around the room. A large wooden bowl,
evidently of home manufacture, stood upon a
washstand. This last article of furniture was of
the necessary height, and consisted of a trans-
verse portion of avery large tree, nicely sawn out,
and serving'the purpose for which it was made
remarkably well. Upon a rock hung towels,
which for their niceness might have shamed many
a landlady, and just at hand were an abundance
of water and soap, h most convincing proof that
all these comforts were for use as well as show.
A dressing table, of the same style as the wash-
stand, supported a small looking-glass, with other
articles for the toilet, besides a vase of fragrant
flowers, which filled the room with their perfume,
and, to complete all, the floor was covered with
bark matting, which gave to everything a look of
elegance and comfort that would have astonished
many another one as it did David McDonald-
meeting it here, hundreds of miles away from
civilized life. After looking around him for a
few moments, his face expressing something of
the surprise and admiration he felt, the young
farmer exclaimed:
"Upon my word, Willie, you are a real prince
here ! So far as you are concerned, I don't think
I've done anything worthy of thanks ; to be lugged
away from so nice a place as you have made of
your little home, don't seem to me a particularly
desirable thing. At first one is inclined to think
it all the work of magic, but a second glance
gives all a most tangible position and character,"'
" Well, I must leave you to test the material-
ity of all by yourself. If-y ou flnd yourself in need
of anything not at hand, ring the chambermaid's

the bed for a little time, for a thorough stret e--

refreshing thing ; and after it, dinner will do 3 t
all the more good. Now let questions wait on
appetite for an hour or so," and before livid
could reply he found himself alone.
After his not unwearisome journey of nore
than a thousand miles, and the last half of it
performed on foot, in a canoe, or upon the Nwk
of a borrowed mule, each in its turn, as be couhtl
catch it, the thought of rest was really gr-t
ful to our traveler. Not i three long weeks had
he seen its much of real comfort as lnow surround-
ed him in this little home, so remote front ani1
other human habitation; and all was the tt If
this one lone man. But it was not natural ihat
too long a time should be spent in sentiment al

felt himself constrained to act upon the sugg-

a wooden basin, and soon he might have been
seen gathering from the well-tended vines the rich
strawberries, which could not have failed to
tempt one's appetite at any time, in any land.
But a short time was required to fill the ves-
sel from the abundance, and good care was taken
that not one of a mean appearance for size or
ripeness should find its way in - among those so
large and juicy. The most fastidious housewife
would have been satisfied with the niceness dis-
played in this part of the, preparation. During
the time consumed in plucking and preparing the
fruit for the table, and in crushing cotfee which
he had himself roasted, the fire had got so well
under way as to be nearly ready for use, and now
from a subterranean apartment, reached by rais-
ing one of the heavy planks which went to make
'up the floor, a hole scarcely deep enough to be
dignified with the appellation of cellar, Wilson
produced a pair of prairie chickens ready dress-
ed for cooking. These split in half and laid up-
on the bright wood coals, soon sent through the
little cabin a most inviting and hunger exciting
odor, and that mingled with the perfur e of the
coffee which was soon smoking near it, foretold a
feast in which many an epicure might have wish-
ed to share.
It was with an emotion very nearly akin to
pride that the young man viewed all his arrange-
ments, when everything was ready for his.visiter;
very often had he entertained guests here in his
hermitage, and taken great pleasure in feeding
with luxuries, not often enjoyed upon these prai-
ries, poor, worn, and half starved hunters, but
never before had he prepared a dinner with so
much thought to its appearance.
David was fast asleep when Wilson entered
his bed room to call him, but he knew too-well
the sensations and dreams arising from sleeping
upon a half famished stomach, to feel any hesi-
tation with regard to arousing him.
" Come, Davie," he said, laying his hand upon
the sleeper's shoulder--" dinner is waiting for
such an appetite as you must have !"
The young man still half dreaming sprang to
the floor and for a moment he was wholly be-
wildered, every thing around him seemed so
strange. A word from Willie helped him to re-
call every thing that had occurred before he
slept.
"After all, I have not seemed to you such a
very slow cook, have I, David ?"
"No, Willie, nor is your bed such an one as one
would look to find in such an out of the way place
as this. It must possess some very peculiar prop-
erties, for when I threw myself upon it I had not

the most distant thought of sleep, but after my
head touched the pillow I had but one idea-that
was not such a very definite one either-some-
thing like what a Turk might indulge in, when
resting in his luxurious cushions."
"And I hope my dinner may be as agreeable to
your empty stomach, as was my bed to your worn
out limbs."
Saying this, William led the way to the adjoin-
ing apartment, and pointed his guest to one of the
two seats at the well-spread table. David sat
down, and for a little time looked upon all with
an astonishment too great for words. At last he
broke out--
"Willie, do you remember the first time Delia
Phelps visited our home?  I have thought of
what she said of our home a thousand times-
she was not certain as to its reality-thought it
fairy-like, you remember !' Now, I understand
precisely how she felt; I am in the same fix with
regard to everything here !"
"And your best way of becoming convinced of
the tangibility of my surroundings, is to attack
them, my boy," said Wilson playfully, and then
be went on in the same spirit-"and, to begin, I
will give you this half of a prairie chicken, and
a cup of coffee, which I flatter myself can't be
surpassed in the old McDonald home."
Following the suggestion of his host, David
soon found himself too much absorbed in the
work before him for any thing like conversation,
and Wilson watched with real satisfaction the
eager enjoyment of his brother. At length when
he had demolished a second half of a prairie-
chicken, and emptied his cup the second time of
the refreshing coffee, and passed it to be again
filled, he said,
"Now do, Willie, tell me how on earth you
have managed to possess yourself of all that I
see in your house ? your table compares well
with our very best, and yet I'm sure I've traveled
nearly a hundred miles without coming across a
trading post, or even a hut where lived any liu-
man being-and yet I find you here in the enjoy-
ment of real luxuries-prairie chickens swim-
ming in butter, coffee rejoicing in the richest of
cream, and delicious civilized bread, and as to
the strawberries, I'll ask no questions of them
till I have become satisfied on those other points "
"I can very easily satisfy you, David," an-
swered Wilson, at the same tiume,helping him to
a generous dish of strawberries, dressing them
well with cream and sugar. "I have very little
here, that this magnificent land does not produce
for me. The chickens live in tens of thousands
upon these plains. As to wheat and corn, I grow

"Am I so much changed by my sickness, Wil-
lie ?"
"In yourr face, very much changed, my poor
Davie, but not more than we would expect from
such an illness. Do you know how long since
you arrived here, David ?"
"No, that is the very thing I was thinking of
to-day, but I suppose it must be as much as two
weeks." Wilson smiled mournfully as he an-
swered:
',It is one month to-day, my dear David-you
came the fifteenth of June-this is the fifteenth
of July." The face of the invalid was express-
ive of the greatest astonishment.
"One month, Willie !-the fifteenth of July--
are you serious?"
"tes, I am quite serious-did you not feel at
that time, when you awoke-more than a week
ago it was-that you had slept very long ? You
remember you asked me, was it late? thinking
evidently that but one night had passed since
you arrived, and, as I judged from your manner,
that you had overslept yourself! Since that
have you had no recollection of the time which
intervened between your coming here and the
time of that awaking 1"
" No, I only felt that I had dreamed a great
deal," was the answer"-though when I wished
to get up, you told meI had been sick, which I
should very soon have discovered from my weak-
ness ; yet I had no idea, Willie, that I was 'so
long sick-it must have been nearly three
weeks!"
" You were insensible to all that passed around
you, three weeks'to the very day, David !"
"And all that time you were here alone, Wil-
son-no one to assist you in the care of me !"
exclaimed the invalid in a commiserating way.
" Did you have any fears that I would not re-
cover, at any time I" he asked in a low voice.
"You had better have asked-had I at any
time a hope that you would recover, and I should
have answered you, it was impossible to give up
all hope while there was life! Your disease was
such as very few in this part of the world re-
cover from; yet you had a very severe attack,
and without a grain of medicine lived through it,
though it run the very extreme limit of its course
upon you, which is twenty-one days."
"And all this time I knew nothing of your
anxiety and suffering, my poor Willie. How
dreadfully desolate you must have been !"
" Your unconsciousness was the greatest bless-
ing to both of us, David-let us feel thankful 'for
it-for had you realised but a fourth part of your
suffering, you could not have lived. A look at

11

these thin hands will tell you something of what
it must have been !"
The invalid regarded for a moment his emaci-
ated hands, with a sad, thoughtful expression;
then seeming to recollect himself, he exclaimed :
"What must they think at home? IIt is now
a full six weeks since they have received a word
from me, and Heaven only knows how much
longer it must bel rve no patience with my-
self, Willie, thatI should have got sick at such a
time! Strong as I was, there was no possible
use in it! How we might have been at home
long before this had I but shown myself half a
man! I tell you there was no sense in my giving
out at such a time!" The young man spoke in
an excited, impatient way. His companion took
one of his thin hands within his own.
"David! David! let us not dare to murmur,
but rather lift our hearts to Heaven with thanks-
giving! You have stood upon the very brink of
the grave, and yet your feet were staid there!
Let us thank God with our inmost souls, that
this stroke did not fall when it seemed almost
upon us! It is not ours to yield, or not, to dis-
ease, as we may choose. Man, with all his
boasted strength, must yield, even as an infant,
when sickness comes-and in this, as in every
thing else, we have the one comfort,-no trial-
not even the very smallest one, is without a pur-
pose !"
"Yet will you not acknowledge, Wilson, this
was quite unnecessary?" asked David, in a voice
which showed him somewhat humbled-"I may
require a little chastising, I do not doubt but that
I do-but I have not been the sufferer-to me it
has been no more than a dream! All the trial
has fallen upon you, and Heaven knows you had
suffered enough before!"
"We must endeavor to believe, David, that
Heaven knows much better than we can what
we need-if we are never able to see why this
should have been, it is such a blessing that we
know there is an eye unlimited in vision, which
understands wherein all this was required!-Lie
quiet, David; I can't allow you to talk any miore
-but you.may just listen calmly to what I have
to say, for I have thought of all this a great
deal.
"When you were first taken sick I knew well
the nature of your disease, and, fully realizing
your danger, I was almost wild with anxiety.
Having no kind of medicine-not even the most
simple-I knew not what to do! I have never
kept any medicine for my own use, having no one
to administer it in case I was ill; and hAving seen
too much of the bad results of a sick man, un-

educated in the science, taking medicine with-7
out even sober reason to guide as to quality or i
kind, I had thought it better, if disease shouldN
come, to allow it to take its course! But when
you were taken so violently ill, how sorely I re-
gretted my extreme prudence r but there was no
help for it. Could I have left you, fifty miles at
least must have been passed over to have procur-
ed what I required; but to leave your side was
out of the question, so all that was left to me wasf
to do the very best I could, and hope and pray
that some straggling hunter might happen along,1
to provide me with a part, if not all, that your
case required.
"Sometimes I grew almost frantic with wait-
ing and watching, but none came, and now I con-
fidently believe it is to the absence of all these
remedies we owe your recovery. Circumstances
compelled me to make the most of what I pos-
sessed, and you not only passed the fearful crisis
in safety, but since that you have gone on mend-
ing with astonishing rapidity. Providence knew
better than I did what you required, and in spite
of my importunings, acted for your good. I be-
lieve, David, it is always so, though it may be very
hard for us to reconcile it with our human wisdom,
Sometimes, to make us more trusting, perhaps,
circumstances are so arranged that, blind as
we are, we can't help seeing that what we had
thought a bitter affliction, proved a very great
ble ssing. Is it not possible, we may sometime
learn wherein this very serious illness of yours
was necessary to our actual good ?"
Wilson's low tone and gentle manner quite,
soothed his patient's excited irritability, and
when the speaker paused with this question,
David said with a smile;
" Your life has made you very different from
what you used to be, Willie, and we were never
much alike ; you know very well I am no philos-
opher!" This was said with a smile.
"But you are a Christian, David, which is much
better !" was the quick, earnest answer.
"I don't know--I'm  not so pure I am that
either. I don't think I have been subjected to
the-test which decides real practical christianity!
When all goes fair and prosperous, it is very
easy to trust all to God,-to say we believe He
does every thing for the best and acts with a
wisdom which man should not dare to question ;
but trial and sorrows and disappointments make
a very different case, and the christianity that
won't stand these-that won't enable one to look
to God still with confidence, and say with sincer-
ity, ' though Thou slay me, yet will I trust in

Thee,' isn't the kind one wants, and I am afraid
s the kind I possess."  The invalid spoke in a
way that told his companion how much he felt
what he was saying.
"There may be much truth in all you say,
David, but when every other prop is removed
beyond our reach, to me it would seem an un-
natural thing to refuse that one that can never,
fail. In prosperity, one might easily forget God,
for surrounded by thousands of worldly blessings,
he don't realize their need of those divine-
but when desolate, almost hopeless, how unnatu-
ral to cast aside the only glimmer of hope and
comfort."
"Ah! yes, you understand ; but remember,
every one don't understand !" was the reply-
'but, to seem the Christian so completely as to
deceive the world and even one's self, is very
easy, when all-goes fair; but seeming won't an-
swer in adversity-that shows you to yourself
and the world as you really are-and I had almost
said, that only can !"
Just at this moment,. a shadow falling across
the door, made Wilson start up, and an instant
after, a stranger stepped upon the threshold.
There was no need that he should ask for rest
and food ; his haggard face told how much both
these were required ! Wilson pas no new hand
at acting the hospitable host, and very soon in
the adjoining room the traveler was partaking of
a comfortable dinner, and scarcely was he
through with satisfying the cravings of hunger,
when his head began to droop, and stretching
himself upon the floor, he soon slept as a man
who had known no rest for days !
For two or three hours Wilson allowed the
poor worn-out fellow to lay as he had thrown
himself down, for he seemed so unconscious of
the hardness cfhis couch, a sleep seemed so much
of a luxury to him, the young man thought it a
pity to break his slumbers ; but after all the
household duties had been completed, and David
comfortably settled for the night, the apartment
which had long ago been christened "the guest
chamber," was prepared by Wilson to receive
the worn-out stranger. It was with great diffi-
culty he was aroused sufficiently to change the
floor for a comfortable bed, and before his head
scarcely touched the pillow he was in a sound
sleep again--having hardly spoken a word of
thanks for all the kindness he was receiving.

"You are not going, air-the sun is overpower-
ing in its heat, and feeble as you seem you would
faint before anhour !"
For an instant the eyes of the traveler were
turned upon the speaker; it was the first time
Wilson had been able to catch his gaze, and the
demoniac expression which seemed a part of
those light blue eyes, was a strong enough plea
to let the fellow go without another remon-
strance. But then he was a man-or at least
bore the form of one-and the past had taught
Wilson the injustice of judging too hastily-at
least let the past have been whatever it might,
now he- was a fellow-wanderer, and sympathy
seemed most natural.
After the first moment the young man's remon-
strance seemed quite unheeded-even forgotten
by the grizzly bearded stranger. The only ac-
companiment he had-a small greasy knapsack-
he had carefully adjusted over his shoulder, and
confined it there by a strap passing across his
breast and under one arm. The fastening of this
was looked to with as much care as had it been
a safeguard to a miser's treasure, and the host
saw that his kind words had scarcely been ob-
served by the old man.
" You have nearly fifty miles to pass over be-
fore you find another white man, sir; do you
think you have the strength to endure the
fatigue ?"
Wilson asked this in a way which could not
fail to elicit a reply-his manner was respectful,
and his voice and words were expressive of sin-
cerity.
"Fifty miles, you say !" was the answer, in a
half dubious tone.
"Fifty miles ! well it can't be got over by lying
still, young man."
"No, certainly not," said Wilson, now more
than half attracted towards the stranger, for his
voice possessed a peculiar charm in its musical
tones, which had not been before perceptible, as
this was the first time he had spoken, save in
monosyllables, and his pronounciation was not
that of a wild hunter, as one would have expect
ed from his appearance. "But, is it so imperative
that you should be in haste? a few days' rest
might prepare you for your journey, and possible
secure to you company, for hunters frequently
pass over this route."
" I wish no company, young man, and I've n
few days to lose. My life has been long, but
shall count it all lost-all lost- should I fail i
doing the one thing that remains to me!"

it told that this somethiny was no work of love-
that it was the closing up of a life dark and fear-
ful-but his contact with desperate characters
had not been of rare occurrence since his banish-
ment from the world, and he had long since learn-
ed that to influence them at all, it was necessary
to treat them with a frank confidence.
" Your business is your own, sir, but as a fellow-
man I would do my best to persuade you to take
a day at least to recruit, if that business is of the
least importance to you or any one else. For in
your present state you can't endure the hardship
you will be compelled to meet, before coming to
the next stopping place; and if you perish alone
upon the prairie, your work must perish with
you-besides you have no means of procuring
food."
" No, my old rifle had served me well, but I
lost it three days ago. Worn out with walking,

and bye I shall have a long one, but not yet. I
should sleep illy if this last act of my life was not
done-even were the grave my bed, I should not
rest !"
The voice of the old man seemed much
changed as he said this. It was no longer clear,
but hollow and mysterious in its sound.
Wilson saw it was useless to attempt to dis-
suade him, and now all that was left, was to fit
him out as well as it lay in his power for the con-
tinuance of this journey,
"Are you acquainted with the trail before
you?" was the young man's inquiry-and when
his companion answered that he was not, having
passed much lower when on his way to the
mountains. Wilson went on,
" You mentioned having tried an old raft-if
you have strength to manage it, I can let you
have a small skiff, which would give you a little

from the strange being in spite of himself.

sought for one to whom he could trust his two
treasures, but thus far his search had been vain.
Old enough that naturally the end of his race
should have seemed to him near, this man shrank
from the thought of death, as if he had been the
only one upon whom the sentence had been pro-
nounced. Without a heart-throb of love for any
being on earth save his child, without confidence
in even her, he clung to the world with! more
than mortal strength, refusing to listen if one
spoke of another life, for which it seemed neces-
sary that he should be making himself ready.
"This life," he would say with cold bitterness,
"has been quite enough. When it is done I would
be dead-senseless as the earth which shall cover
me; I have no hope, no desire beyond-no! nor
fear-I have lived and shall be dead ! If there
is a Creator, to him be all the glory or shame
connected with my life, whieh has contained very
little of good to me."
Such, and even more sceptical and chilling re-
plies, were received by all who could gain his ear,
and ventured to remonstrate with him on his un-
natural way of looking to the end, which to all
others than himself was seen rapidly approach-

would he have left her,-when distrust would creep,
into his heart ; he would fancy he saw covert do-
signs in either the friend or those having charge
of his daughter, upon her or him, or his wealth ;
so with some pretence, it scarcely mattered what

-for he permitted no one to question him-he
would remove her, just as she had become suffi-
ciently attached to feel a sense of home-sickness
stealing over her at the severing of newly-formed
ties. So nearly her whole life of twenty-one
years had passed-she, the envied of many an
one, yet herself feeling that the daughter of the
simple cottager, with her home love and home
duties, was an object which she might well envy.
And other cares and sorrows, too, she had than
this. Her father she loved-not blindly-but de-
votedly-unselfishly. She knew well he was not
what he once had been, though his face with the
dark cloud was the only father's-the only pa-
rent's face she had everknown ; but her heart told
her there had been a time when it had not rested
there-that a crushing sorrow, as her fears some-
times whispered, a crushing shame hadstamped it
upon hin ; and, loving him as she did, it was not
possible for this young girl to escape the effects
of this shadow.
When, in early spring, Mr. Farnham had de-
clared to his daughter his determination to seek
a home within a little cottage, in a most seclu-
ded part of the country, where they should see
no one only such as they might choose, and have
the benefit of fresh air and exercise, which his
gradually failing health admouished him were
most essential, she received the ipteligence with
delight. It mattered very little to her where she
went, so it was home-though, had it been her's to
choose, she would have said the country in pre-
ference to the city, and a cottage hoo1 rather
than one of splendor.
Her father was no niggard in his providing, nor
did she lack taste in the expenditure of his
wealth, and she found her little home a very at-
tractive place; so munch so, that she felt she
could be very happy here with no other society
than her father, her books and her music-act-
ing the housewife when necessary, and attending
her garden for amusement.
Nor did Henrietta find, on trial, that she hail
overrated her domestic qualities. Her home
seemed to her a delightful place, and narrowly
she watched herself that, by no look or wish ex-
pressed, should her father be led to seek change
on her account, and now surely she felt they were
safe from his apprehending anything serious fromI
any acquaintance or intercourse with society-
for they had none that could afford any one the
least pleasure.
Early in May they had left thme city, and then
Mr. Farnham had not allowed his feebleness to
be but slightly visible to any one-even to Ilhenri-
etta-though she knew he was very far from well,

for too often she heard his uneasy turning upon his
bed, and sometimes, during the still hours of the
night, she heard his troubled step up and dewn
his room, which told that rest was a stranger to
his pillow.;. but to her anxious inguiries,his re-
ply was always that he was well, and her know-
ledge of his.nature forbade her pressingthe mat,
ter. Bat as spring lost itself in summer,. he
yielded more and rpore to the enervating influ-
ences around him,.and often times stern and silent
he sat from morning till night unoccupied, save
with his thoughts.
Before coming into this secluded home, Mr.
Farnham had confided to his partner, Mr. Phelps,
his plan for the summer, to remain perfectly
quiet and separate from business for the year,
that, as he expressed it, he might become famish-
ed for the turmoil connected with it, of which he
was now heartily sick. Although these two men
often disagreed, yet no person had for long years
the -decided confidence of this cold unloving
man of the world that Mr. Phelps had. How he had
won it he could not 'himself well have told, for
well he remembered the many sharp controversies
they had held, not alone upon business, but often
upon important moral questions, which not un-
frequently leave bitterness behind. '
"I think he will withdraw from the house-
he is immensely rich, and with this one child only
to provide for, I can see no good reason for his
remaining where he is sure to be crossed, for I
can't hold my peace when I hear such ideas ad-
vanced; and to tell you the truth, I shan't be sorry
when the day of our dissolution comes, for he is
not a pleasant partner."
This, or something very like it, had been Mr.
Phelps' remark to his wife nearly a score of times,
yet the firm remained the same ; and when Mr.
Farnham told of his plans for the year, he gave
up all care and management to his partner more
entirely than he had ever done before, confiding
to him his retreat, at the same time requesting
him not to annoy him in matters of business, or
reveal to any one his secluded quarters.
And three months gave themisanthrope no cause
to regret his confidence, for never in all that time'
had he been been vexed with unnecessary letters,
or a visitor that could have been attributed to any
information given by his partner. Yet instead
of becoming famished for the world, by being
out of it, he every day grew more entirely to dis-
like it, to wish never more to return to it. But
his child soon begun to understand that his
thoughts, let them be what they might, were not
health-producing, and day after day, she increas-
ed her efforts to win him from his moodiness, to

converse with her, to listen to her music or
reading, or to give her his assistance in, caring
for her flowers. But her efforts proved futile or
nearly so, for in spite of everything he kept his
place in his large chair, every day growing thin-
ner, and, had it been possible, more dejected, his
face wearing the expression of one inwardly
struggling against fate, yet compelled gradually
to yield.
But for her father's apparent unhappiness,
Henrietta would have been very happy in her
cottage home, for, with all her capabilities for
deriving enjoyment from the outer world, she was
very far from dependent upon it, having within
herself resources sufficient to atone. for the loss
of society; but when she saw the only object
the earth contained for her to love,. without hope
or joy, she, could not fail to feel her heart at
times weighed down by gloom.
The silence which Henrietta's father had ever
manifested towards her upon nearly all.subjects,
but particularly upon his cause for shunning and
hating the world., had made her fear ever to ap-
proach him upon that matter, or even ask a ques-
tion which might give him an, idea it was called
up by his peculiarities. Yet this would not have
been so much a source of sadness to her, had it
not been so connected with another thought-her
mother. Once-it had been very many years
since-she had asked her father to tell her of her
mother, who hed died long before she could re-
member ! How this 'request had been received
she was not likely to forget-the perfect storm
of rage which had been expressed in her parent's
face, and the terror which his voice had sent
through her,as he bade her never question him
again of one who had turned him from a man to
a fiend, who had well nigh made him hate his
own child, that she had been its mother.
She had not a coward's heart, yet the thought
of her father's words sent a chill to her very soul,
even after years had passed away, and, whatever
might be her desires, this remembrance proved
sufficient to keep her from asking further ques-
tions. But often enough she longed and prayed
that her parent's reserve might be cast aside, that
she might give him all the comfort to be derived
from sympathy; for, whatever might be the sor-
row-aye-shame. was it' not her own as well
as his? And that he should carry it to the grave
shut close within his heart, drawing his very life
blood, she felt was doing not only himself but her
a cruel wrong
However, time had gone on so long without
bringing any change, she had almost ceased to
hope for any, and, woman-like, made the most of

the little she could do for her father, coaxing him
out into her little garden sometimes-exercising
her ingenuity in getting up tempting dishes for
his delicate appetite, and, while he sat at table,
chatting away, encouraged by scarcely an an-
swer, thus hoping to win him to forget himself
and take more than his scanty morsel of food ;
but, had not her perseverance been inexhaustible,
she would have very soon been discouraged by
her poor success, and, as it was, her heart often
enough sank within her ; but she felt there was
no good in despair, and possibly her unhappy
parent was a little less wretched when he saw
her cheerful--so day after day she tried her little
wits and bore her failures as best she could.
The first of August came without bringing
with it any marked change, and one, at least, of
the dwellers in the little cottage began to feel in
connection with all around her, a most agreeable
home sensation.' Every day the man of all work
was sent to the village, to bring home whatever
the post office might contain for them ; but Hen-
rietta waited his return with no anxiety, for none
of her many friends knew where to direct their
epistles had they been disposed to write-but
with her father it was very different-from the
moment the man set out upon his errand, 'till he
returned with the welcome intelligence-"no
letters"-he was a stranger to rest; yet,;tq a
casual observer, this would not have been so ev-
ident as was it to his child, who watched every
movement of his dark, overshadowed eyes, in a
way which told her how dear was his happiness
to her. One day when she was engaged upon a
piece of sewing, sitting near her father, she ven-
tured to say, as she saw his eyes turn quickly at
some slight noise,
"What makes you start so, father ? it .was but
this rose bush sweeping against the window !"
"I start!" he exclaimed in a tone too expres-
sive of offense to be misunderstood--"I did not
start, Hettie, and I don't wish to be told that I
did by my child."
Seeing her mistake in speaking of it, or show-
ing that she observed his discomfort, the daugh-
ter hastened to make amends, by saying in a very
quiet tone :
"I might have been mistaken, father, but I
was unusually anxious about you to-day, for you
were not looking as well as usual, and I may be
nervous myself; but don't be angry with me, dear
father."
As she said this, she put aside her work, and
leaving her chair, took her place upon a stool at
her parent's feet, laying her cheek down upon his
knee, in a pleading way.

"No, no, Hettie, child, I am not angry ; what
should I be angry at ? Why will you fret your-
self in this way ? I've no cause to be angry, and
I'm no criminal, that I should start at every
sound-am I, daughter ? I say I'm no criminal,
Hettie, that I should be afraid of the wind; tell
me if you have ever thought, me criminal, or
ever dreamed ill of me ?"
He spoke in a hurried, half gasping tone, which
quite alarmed his child; and his eyes were
strange in their expression, as they might, have
been, had he been gazing upon some heart chill-
ing sight, which as yet no other eye had seen, but
which he was in momentary expectation of being
discovered by one who of all others he would
have never behold it. Henrietta was now truly
alarmed.
" Why do you speak like this, father?" she
said, pleadingly; "how could I dream ill of you?
how could I think you criminal? I know you
have suffered ; that you always suffer; but I don't
think it your fault ; if I ever did, father, I don't
think so now!"
" There, that is enough, Hettie-if you ever
did, you don't now-that is enough!"
He said this in a cold, severe tone, and his child
understood that his more gentle mood was gone;
but, if she had possessed the courage to reply,
the arrival of the servant would have prevented
her.
As was her wont, she hastened out to receive
whatever he might have brought for her father.
" There's one letter, ma'am-and not sich a
very great load to carry, either, ma'am, though
they seem in a might hurry about its gittin here,
for they were just startin a man to bring it over
when I got there."
Henrietta took the letter eagerly, for her fath-
er's peculiar manner towards her, joined to what
the man had said of the letter, had awakened a
strange terror in her breast-a fear of something
dreadful coming-what, she could not have told.
A glance at the superscription told her it was
from her parent's partner, and in one corner the
"please deliver with haste," explained what
the servant had told her of a messenger about be-
ing despatched with the letter when he arrived.
A moment she was hesitating whether she should
deliver the missive to her father in his present
mood, when his hand was laid upon her arm.
"What are you looking at, child-why are you
standing here ? is the letter for you or me ? "
"For you, father ; it is for you, but don't look
in that way at me !"

of forgiveness, and it was my hand which wiped
the death-damp from her brow, and at last closed
her sweet eyes ; and when I saw her stretched
to her rest, with the head of her dead infant pil-
lowed upon her bosom, I murmured as I pressed
one last kiss upon her pale cold lips, 'thank Godc
she is at peace!'"
. . j
Henrietta had sat with lips parted, and as her I
head was bent forward her young face bore theP
very impress of agony-but as these last few
words were spoken every feature relaxed, and
giving a heavy sob she murmured involuntarily as
it seemed, "thank God !" and her face was bu-
ried in her hands.
Her companion started at the sound of her!
voice, and quickly he caught the meaning of her
emotion.
"Hah poor child! your heart shrunk from
the thought, that she was your mother ! I did
not think of that, poor little trembler ! No, she
and all that belonged to her was laid in the grave,
and I lived to avenge their wrongs ! The wretch
who had done all this evil moved proudly among
his fellow-men and all smiled upon him. He had
wealth, talent and education-these won him the
place which should only be given to one possess-
ing a heart of virtue. But I held my peace. I
resolved to bide my time, for I knew it would
come. He was courted by the world and ere
long, I said to myself, would come the time when
he would choose for himself one dearer than all
others. I was right, and not very long had I to
wait.
"But Heaven is my witness, that, wholly lost
as my heart was, I felt something like regret when
I saw what a fair and noble being must be crush-
ed to accomplish my end ; but the remembrance
of my ruined hopes so overcame everything in
my soul but a desire for revenge, and from that
moment I never wavered. But I would not ap-
proach one so high-souled and noble,to leave her a
crushed and ruined thing. Could I have done it, I
would not! Besides, I knew the man with whom
I had to deal too well to take a mis-step in the
doing of my work. Self was his idol; had I left
that untouched, I felt he would but laugh at
me.
"I had forced him to consider me a friend, and
he dreamed not that I knew him as the -lighter
of my joy, and at his bridal none smiled more
brightly than did I, or spoke their congratula-
tions in tones more expressive of friendship; and
well might any man be proudly happy-as he
was--with such a noble woman loving and trust-
ing him so entirely as did his bride.

"I did not feel in haste about my work, but day
after day I was a welcome guest in their house,
and fairly glutted over the destruction I would,
work them. With not only the husband, but with
his bride too, I learned to feel myself a favorite,
visitor, and, had he not been so confident of his
own power, I think he might sometime have been
ealous of the attention given me by his wife, for
his love was not so perfect as to preclude the pos-
sibility of such athing, granting, as I must, there
was no cause.
"A year of their wedded life passed without
any jars that the world knew of-though some-
times I saw a cloud upon the fine brow of my
friend's wife, that I was sure he had had some
hand in placing there; but it appeared to me al-
ways more a cloud of proud sorrow than of an-
ger, and that promised well for me ! Then there
came a new joy into the house, in the shape of
an infant son-and the father was as proud in
his happiness as I could wish to see him-for the
prouder he was, the more perfect would be his
wretchedness I know !
" Their boy they named for me, and I gave it
many a caress and tender word-after sporting
with the fine little fellow to the delight of both
the parents-then I went away from there ; I
had an indefinite idea why, yet I would not now
explain it, for another who did not know both
the characters with which I had to deal, could
not understand it. More than a year I traveled,
and in all that time I was in constant correspond-
ence with both my friend and his wife, and then
there came a letter which told me of another lit-
tle link added to the household chain-a lovely
daughter-and the father's heart rejoiced as so
did the mother's, that this little stranger was
like its father, much more than was the son.
The same dark eyes, the mother wrote me, that
we must both of us understand--and the hair
was mote like his than like hers. Poor confiding
noble heart, she little knew what a villain I was,
nor how poorly I was about to repay her confi-
dence! ,But now I felt was my time and I im-

er, my darling brother, his right ; bring him home,
and hear him speak with his own lips his forgive-
ness for the wrongs of the past, that your last days
may be your best days; and then, any own father,
you shall have no chance to complain, that your
child-your Hettie, has lost aught of her affec-
tion for you'"
She spake tenderly, but with a woman's firm-
ness-one who has an object to accomplish, for
which her life would not be too great a sacri-
fice, could it not be gained without. Her poor
old father sat meekly bowed down, listening as
one he felt deserved no mercy; but he made no
answer to what his child had said.
"Father," she went on, "may he come in-
may this strange man come in, and show to you
that which shall prove beyond a doubt, the truth
of what he has said ; may he come now, father-
without a moment's delay? for you know it must
be done, and the sooner it is passed the better it
will be for you !"
The cowering form shrunk down lower at
this appeal, but there was no escape ; and in a

You have had a strong hand in our sorrow.
I claim it as a right-as one of the sufferers-as
a child of her you so deeply wronged-that you
take not away the little power my father has left,
for repairing this great wrong of restoring my
brother to his right!" Henrietta spoke with the
spirit of a high-souled woman.
"You are a brave girl!'" the old man said, ris-
ing from his chair; "you shall control me in this,
thohgh I would not have believed the earth con-
tained the being who could influence me as you
have. I will be gentle with an mortal en(Wy 1(f-
your sake, and you shall promise me that you will
sometimes think of me with kindness, when I
have gone to my rest!"
The old man spoke with feeling, and the grate-
ful look which his companion gave him, would
have been a sufficient answer, but she had a
better.
"I thank you for this, and if my brother ever
returns to us, I promise you, our thoughts--not
only mine but his-when they turn to you, shall
not be such as can take from the peacefulness of

prison; and who do you think was his chief ac-
cuser ? I tell you, child, it was his own father'1
And he knew he was raising his voice against the
child of her he had promised to love, cherish andk
protect! Do you remember this case, young
lady, the case of Wilson Harley? in which your
father and ims stood up against him for whom
strangers' hearts were melted with pity ?"
Henrietta's attention had been chained through
this whole relation, and she looked as one pre-
pared for a startling announcement ; but, what-
ever she had expected, this inquiry of the strange
narrator brought her suddenly to her feet.
" His father and mine !  Wilson Harley's
father and mine ! Are you mad, sir, or do you
know what you are saying ?" She asked this in
a scarcely audible voice, and her hand which had
been laid upon the old man's shoulder, held him
in a vice-like grasp. He took hold of her hand in
a tender, pitying way. ,
" Be calm, child-I have not spoken as one
mad , I have not told this story as though it had
been originated in my brain; I wonder that I
could speak as calmly as I have, for I came here
with but one desire-to complete my revenge !
I knew my days were numbered, and night and
day I have traveled, that I should not be too late;
but a sight of your face softened my heart; I re-
membered your mother and the wrong I had done
her, and the longings which I had felt to see your
father writhe with his agony of sdul, when he
should hear that his wife was as innocent of that
of which he accused her, as were you, then his
infant daughter, gave way before other thoughts
and emotions. Iam a different man from what I
have been since this shadow fell upon me-since
that dreadful blighting of my hopes. I could al-
most give up this interview with your father, but
now I am influenced by a higher motive than re-
venge ! Justice now compels me to see him, to
tell him all that I have told you, to deliver the
proofs into his hands, that he may know that I,
and I only wrote those letters which first led him
to doubt-and then to cast off his wife forever !
"This more than revenge now actuates me-
and when I have done this, I shall feel that my
work upon this earth is completed ! Now, do
you doubt my speaking in my sober senses 7"
This he asked of his companion in a quiet tone
which he knew so well how to command-and it
had a soothing influence over her. She was still

"My mother ! my poor darling mother !-so no-
ble, yet so deeply wronged," burst from her lips.
"Yes, deeply wronged-and so was another who
still lives to forgive the sins which have been
committed against him. When I started upon
this mission, which was not one of love, I thought
this other-this brother youi have never known--
guilty of a crime which must ever render him
an outcast from society; but before .1 came here
I learned this was but another cruel wrong he
had suffered by the injustice of his fellow-men.
Now take me to your father, child, that I may
put it in his power to retrieve the past, to a very
small extent.'
Thus called upon, the girl arose to comply, but
in spite of herself she shrunk from the task be-
fore her. 'Tis true she had sometimes felt there
must have been a dark page in the life of her
father, but never had it influenced her in her be-
havior towards him, or slackened her in the most
implicit obedience; and now she inwardly shrunk
from seeing him humbled, though, as this strange
being who had been her companion for the last
hour had said, she knew and felt it was justice-
a debt her father owed to his child, his first-born,
who had suffered too deeply for his sins.
With her mind full of these thoughts, she turn-
ed into the house, and the first sight which met
her eyes brought from her an exclamation of
alarm. There sat her poor old father, leaning
helplessly against the window seat, concealed
from view from the porch by the wavy muslin
drapery. His eyes were not closed, yet he
seemed unconscious of the entrance of his daugh-
ter, for there was no movement of limb or muscle.
But when she went to his side and took his cold
hand, calling upon him-
"Father, dear father ! "
He raised his eyes to her face with such an ap-
pealing expression, and his voice might have
awakened sympathy in a less pitying heart as he
said,
"After that, Hettie, after hearing all that you
have justlistened to, can you call me dearfather ?"
She laid her arms about the trembling form,
much as she might have laid them around a very
sinful, but penitent child.
" You are my father, and what there has been
in the past to grieve over, a child should not al-

equal had been her father's share in this evil do- s
ing, but she answered tenderly,          .
" He is very feeble, dear father, and I can't in-
duce him to try the smallest thing as a restora-d
tive ! He says his work is done, and the sooner
he is done with life the better for him and for the
world-yet he is very gentle-like child almost,
in his way of receiving any little attention !"
The last part of the girl's remark was un-
heeded by the father, and his answer showed how
cold and hard was his spirit even in this hour of
his humility.
"He is right ; he has done a demon's work ;
he has rooted the last vestige of good from my
heart-he has robbed- me of the noblest woman
that ever breathed, made my son fatherless, my
daughter motherless, my life that of a cold-heart-
ed wanderer. Let him die uncared for, neglect-
ed ; let him die the death of a dog, as he should !
My child, let him perish, soul and body, unpitied,
uncared for !"
"Father, father, how can you speak so-don't
you remember ? Is it not true that he, too, has
suffered wrong-and, oh ! forgive me for saying
it, but I must; I feel it is right-at your hands,
too 7"
"Child, how dare you, how dare you speak to
me in this way '"   was the sick man's fierce
answer, half raising himself in the bed, and fix-
ing so firm a grasp upon his child's arm as made
her shrink, in spite of herself, with the pain
which he gave her. For an instant his eyes
gleamed upon her, then seeming to recollect him-
self, he sank back cowering upon the pillow.
"Ah yes," he said helplessly, "I must bear it,-
must take insult from my child! I have not
thought it could ever be. I must submit to be-
ing neglected as she may choose for this villain-
my worst enemy ! I might have known it would
be no better! -What right had I to expect aught
else of human love ?"
Had not his inmost soul become hardened by
the great sin which had borne it along, until it
seemed beyond the reach of a noble, manly peni-
tence, it would have echoed in condemning tones,
"what right?" but his was the humility of a cow-
ard. He wished to see his son reinstated-see
him occupying the position which belonged to
him, because he was his son-because now the
world woula, in spite of his desire to the contra-
ry, hear of all the wrong which the boy had suf-
fered at his own father's hands; so he would pa-
cify the world by doing what seemed to him amost
magnanimous act ! But in his humility there
was no meekness, no remembrance within penitent

orrow of the young, fair, but too weak being he
had won from an honorable love, to cast her off a
a ruined, hopeless heart-to die-but for the en-
during fondness of him who had lavished upon her
he wealth of his soul-alone and friendless! No
thought of her years (f struggling with the hard
world; the woman, who had the right to look to
him as her friend and protector, when all others
should fail; no heart grievings as he remembered
his poor boy, a homeless, friendless, wanderer as
he had been on the Christmas morning, more
than fifteen years agone, When he had thrust him
unfeelingly from his door, to wander to the grave
where slept his wronged mother, at last safe
from all sorrow, where he must have died but
for the more faithful affection of the noble dog,
who, after more than five years' separation, re-
coguized his young.master and refused to be sep-
arated from him again! No, although these last
were remembered, they were not remembered
with self-condemnation, with a sorrow which
gives promise of better things, but with a cower-
ing humility, with a bitterness of soul towards
his less guilty sharer in this life-work of evil-
an inward cursing of himself for his stupidity in
thus being duped out of all the good life
might have contained for him, in coming at last
to that miserable state, that he must be an object
of compassion to his bitterest foe!
Poor Henrietta! this was not the least trying
part of her grief, to watch over her own father;
to see him still the cold man he had ever been,
and yet so weak as he had become mentally and
physically! She felt that she could almost have
rejoiced in his childish, dependence, had it been
accompanied by any thing like childish sorrow
or humility; but to see him thus, but for the one
thought-he. was her father-she must have
shrunk from him with loathing!
Then her. poor another! often she had said
"willingly would I submit to a life of drudgery-
of toil of the meanest kind, but to be certain
that no shame attached itself to that name !"
Now she'was certain! This wild being's strange
story had borne upon its face the very impress of
truth, but he did not ask them to trust to that!
The greasy discolored knapsack-the only thing
he had brought with him upon his long journey,
contained proofs which no one could for a mo-
ment dispute ! , The original of the letters Mr.
Farnham had received, with erasures and altera-
tions, proved him  beyond a doubt the writer of
those anonymous epistles, which had at first
aroused the demon suspicion in the husband's
breast ! This must have been enough to satisfy
any one that the wife had been wholly innocent

i

of every thing which had been laid to her charge,
and for which she and her first born had been
cruelly cast off!
Then the small package which had been left
with the poor woman-the most timely friend the
mother had had near her-to be preserved for her
poor boy when he should be motherless, contain-
ed her marriage certificate; all! aye, her only
earthly possession ! That she felt it would be to
him a treasure in after years, proving to him who
were his parents!
A letter accompanied it, addressed to the boy,
her darling Willie, telling him of all she had suf-
fered, and of her entire innocence and utter ig-
norance of all of which she had been accused ;
but what was more convincing of her innocence
than all the rest, was her firm faith in her boy be-
lieving her so ! All had been written in great sor-
sow, but there had been mingled with it no doubt
as to this one thing ; her boy who knew her so
well-knew her better than had ever any other
earthly being-his heart would tell him how
deeply she had been wronged !
Poor thing! when-she was penning that stain-
ed and blotted epistle, her nearly powerless
hands, scarcely able to make the words legible,
she had little thought her daughter, then hardly
more than an infant, would weep over it bitter
tears of pity, regret and deep affection ! That to
her woman's heart it would speak of her mother
as noble and worthy of all the fondness her chil-
dren could give her; that to one who had never
known her, save in her days of unconscious infan-
cy, it would carry proof as conclusive of her in-
nocence, as would it to her boy who loved her as
very few children are capable of .loving, as very
few mothers deserve to be loved !
The thought of her mother, as she now had a
right to think of her was to the daughter a great
joy, but it was a joy mingled with deep grief!-
With the certainty of her mother's purity-the
mother she had never known, there came another
certainty-that of her father's cruelty, guilt.
The only being she had ever known to love, she
now regarded--as how could she help doing-
as deserving nothing better than a shunning
pity-but, no,she would not unteach her heart its
affection-it could do her other parent no good,
and she believed, was that other one able to
speak, she would bid her be true and faithful in
all her duties as daughter.
Then there arose in her mind the picture of
the motherless one who had sought shelter from
the bitter coldness of the winter's night upon
the porch of her father's mansion-their father's
she could now say--the sweet sad-faced Wilson

Harley ! Nor did this picture, with all the re-
membrances which must accompany it, do much
towards comforting her heart as to the part her
father had acted ! He had recognized in this
desolate boy, the child of her who-even grant-
ing her guilt-he had so wrongfully cast off upon
the cold unpitying world, homeless, helpless, and
if sinful, with no encouragement to mend her
ways ! He had once loved her, and yet he could
spurn her poor starving boy from his door with
hard unmanly words ! But Providence had not
been forgetful of those forgotten by man ! The
instinct of the noble dog, who had been the boy's
protector and constant companion in his early
infancy, had enabled the animal to recognise the
poor child, in spite of change; yet Henrietta was
ignorant of the noble Neptune's activity and more
than animal instinct, in caring for his charge,
and saving him from the death which had ap-
proached so nearly.
In truth she knew very little of what had been
her brother's life since, save the fact connected
with his disgrace, for much as she had desired to
meet some of the McDonald family, or Mrs.
Phelps, that she might learn something more of
one who had so much interested her when a child,
her father had ever prevented her seeing them.-
Now she knew it had been by design.
These thoughts all had a place in her mind, pro-
ducing strangely conflicting emotions, but, fortu-
nately perhaps it might be counted, she was not
left to indulge them undisturbed. Here were two
old men hardened in sin, now, after long lives
which had contained very little of good, reduced
to childish dependence, and she must act as their
sole nurse.
Her father required from her the closest atten-
tion, as he had ever required and received the
most implicit obedience, and with Henrietta there
was no thought but to answer his every call as
nearly as she could, and in so doing neglect no
other duty; the other-that wretched, desolate
man, who had traveled over hundreds of miles to
remove the stain which had for years rested upon
that unknown mother's name--no matter what
had been his motive--he had done them a great
good; had repaired as nearly as lay in his power
the sins of a life-time; now that all his life pow-
er seemed exhausted, was he to be left uncared
for, unattended? No ! not while such ready
hands as Henrietta Farnham was near, and ac-
tuated by such a true woman's heart as she pos-
sessed!
Her father would have had the fainting travel-
er thrust from the door, even in the hour of his
cowering humiliation, and when towards him had

family.
Soabetween the two invalids Henrietta found
herself so well occupied, there was small time left
for idle thought, and the three days which passed
between the arrival of Wilson Danforth and the
return of the messenger which had been dis-
patched to Mr. Phelps, to beg of him to lose no
unnecessary time in coming to his partner, Mr.
Farnham, who was too feeble to leave his bed-
passed much more quickly to her than either of
the sick ones. But the sense of relief which she
felt when she saw the messenger spring out of the
carriage at their cottage gate, followed quickly byI
the kind, ever ready Mr. Phelps, was no less than
would it have been had she watched the way from
which the travelers were expected, and counted
the minutes with the greatest impatience.
Way down in her heart there was a restless
aching to have some one at work to bring about
the return of her brother while her father was
still living, and if possible, while that other flick-
ering life should continue to burn. Had it been
possible she felt she should herself have started
upon the mission, butthen there would have been
none to guard and care for her sick, and she re-
solved to perform faithfully the woman's part for
which she proved herself eminently fitted, and
leave the other to the one Providence should ac-
tuate to embark in it; and now when she caught

To Henrietta, this was not a small trial, yet
she faced it bravely, withholding but one thing-
that was the nature of the wrong her father had
done Wilson 'Danforth ! She told him it had
been grievous-she said that, with such a nature,
no one could have expected any less from him in
the way of revenge--that his nature was too
strong to deal with petty good or petty evil-and
she ended by saying:
" Father is very bitter towards him, and I don't
know as we could expect anything else. You
know he has been ill for a long time, but by his
strength of will has resisted disease; but this has
broken him completely-he has not been able to
leave his bed since we heard of it, and some-
times I fear his agitation may hasten his end--yet
I cannot turn this poor man from our house. Mr.-
Phelps I cannot forget, that but for my father he
might-I believe he would-have been so differ-
ent ! Tell me, am I acting right?"
"You are, my child--you are acting with a
noble justice; I should be proud to know that my
own daughter would under like circumstances
prove herself so unselfish-though God forbid
she should ever be put to the test !"
This last was said with much warmth, and ap-
parently as though the speaker was scarcely con-
scious of speaking it out-but that it was with

him an earnest thought ! Then an instant after
he added :
"Come, my child, now take we to your father,
for there is no time to be lost I would have you
remain with us, if he is inclined to cloak himself
in the matter, your presence--knowing every
thing as you do-will be a check upon him, and
he can't so well shrink from performing his part,
before you, his child, as could he before all the
rest of the world ! I want you should be pre-
pared, though, to see him struggle against duty,
for he will-but he must be humbled-must be !-
there is no help for it ! Humbled to the very
dust--I know it will seem to him."
Much as Henrietta felt for her father, it was a
real comfort to her to    hear Mr. Phelps
speak in this earnest, forcible manner---it showed
that he appreciated the importance of the case,
and that she might look to him for assistance in
forcing her father to act with justice---for she
saw he must be forced---that he would, if per-
mitted, shift the blame, as far as was it possible,
to the shoulders of the man whose hopes, whose
life, whose very .soul had been blighted by his
own evil doings; and this daughter had felt how
hard it would be for her, unaided, to prevent this
and still have anything like justice meted out
to her noble brother and her dead mother! But
now, with Mr. Phelps to help her, earnest and
strong as he was, and devotedly attached as she
knew him to be to her brother, the woman was
strong in her heart--'she felt she could stand firm-
ly for the right against her father's threats----
against even his entreaties.
Mr. Phelps could not fail to be startled at what
he had heard, although he had cotne prepared for
a surprise, and in imagination had conjured up all
manner of things, yet the reality was yery differ-
ent from any thing he could have fancied. This
wild unnatural stranger had come to him for in-
formation as to where Mr. Farnham was to be
found, but supposing the poor fellow more than
half crazed, he did not think it best to enlighten
him, yet his manner had been so peculiar he had
attached importance enough to the occurrence to
give his partner a very minute account of it in a
letter, which letter Mr. Farnham had received the
very day, and not an hour before the arrival of
Wilson Danforth beneath his own roof.
When the message to come to Mr. Farnham
without an hour's unnecessary delay reached Mr.
Phelps, his mind immediately reverted to that wild
being, and he thought of some old business mat-
ters being called up to trouble and perplex his
not over-amiable and forbearing partner. Some-
times the idea had crossed his mind that this

man's dealings might not always have been up-
right, he seemed always so suspicious of others
but nothingworse than this (lid he suspect.
Yet so well did 'he master himself, when he en-
tered Mr. Farnham's room, the latter might have
believed he had been told nothing which he had
not known a lifetime. The invalid answered his
visitor's inquiries as to his health, by bitter comi-
plaints, which would have told any one not ac-
quainted with the sad history, that he had been
by far more sinned against than sinning--that he
had been the chief suflfrer, and now in spite of
all his commiands to the contrary, his worst ene-
my-the destroyer of his happiness-hadfound a
hospitable shelter beneath his roof.
Mr. Phelps listened with great caution, that
not by ia look should he betray his knowledge of
the affair.
"Your daughter has toll me something of
this, but she says then maan is too feeble to leave
his bed !  You, Mr. Farnham, who are not
over strong, ought to feel common pity for the
miserable fellow, even it he is a villain. Besides
this don't seem  the matter of first importance
to be considered now-and that too should teach
you to be a little leas severely just, andi a little
more merciful towards the erring, for you can't
have forgotten the time when I plead with you
to deal gently with this son of yours who was
accused of a crime of, which I believe him as
innocent as was I myself, and the sequel proved
him more so, for I can't help feeling that I was
partially responsible for iiy son's dissipated
recklessness ! Yet you remimniber, you turned a
deaf ear to all I had to say, pretending you felt it
would be injustice to the boy not to punish him
as such a crime merited. Well, you had your
way, and we have seen the consequence partially!
May heaven grant that we see nothing more
serious than we have already-that before a,
much longer time passes, the wanderer may be
broughtlback to us; and, Mr. Farnham, don't you
think we should endeavour that this lesson be
not lost upon us-that it teach us ,o lean even
weakly, if you choose so to call it-to the side of
mercy, rather than execute too severe justice 1"
Mr. Phelps spoke in a reproving tone, and the
invalid listened as one not at all comfortable.
His answer was that of an overbearing spirit be-
reft of power.  -
"None could have supposed that letter a for-
gery. I am not the only one, Mr. Phelps, who
was compelled to acknowledge it must be the
work of him whose name it bore--besides, how
was I to know anything of the young mnaun. But
had I, was it more unnatural in inc believing hium


The sick man said something in a complain-
ing tone of his child's unkindness and disobedi-
ence,but Mr. Phelps by avery few words silenced
him, and at the end of an hour the invalid had.
learned the folly of trying to deceive his partner,
and although he did not cease his complainings,
did not give up declaring himself very badly
treated--his authority completely outraged, and he
the most unhappy of all fathers; yet little by
little he yielded to Mr. Phelps' propositions with
regard to the immediate steps to be taken, and
before he was left to his rest he had consented to
his partner making as full a statement of the un-
fortunate matter as he should deem proper or
necessary, to be inserted in the principal journals
of the whole country, concluded by the offer of
"five thousand dollars reward" for any correct
and positive information of the lost Wilson Har-
ley, alias Wilson Farnham.
When this was accomplished, Mr. Phelps de-
clared his determination to hasten back to the

Quite unconscious of the importance into
which he had suddenly grown, even among those
who had before scarcely known of his existence,
Wilson rowed his boat down the river with a
light-hearted joyousness which would have scan-
dalised many a sentimentalist. That he had been
very unhappy he would not have denied; and that,
too, from the unprovoked injuries which he had
received when doing his best to gain for himself
an honorable position, by performing faithfully
and uprightly his duty towards others-but the
gloaming hour had passed, and full of health mor-
ally and mentally, he was ready to receive the joy-
ous sunlight and rejoice in it ! David, who was
not yet sufficiently recovered to assist his com-
panion in his labors, or even to endure the fa-
tigue connected with the journey, unless cared for
with the greatest tenderness, reclined upon the
comfortable bed which had been spread for him,
and shielded from the sun's scorching' rays, as
well as the chilling winds of morning and evening,

to the sad remembrance of the past, threatened to
be almost too much for him to endure! Yet,
David knew how useless would be anything he
could say, so he watched him sileptly, seeming all
the time occupied with his own thoughts.,
When at length the cars stopped at the depot
where the two travelers were to leave them,
Wilson aroused himself again, and attended to
the removing of their baggage with more pres-
ence of mind than could be expected of him.
The lad whom h9 engaged to take him and his
companion home, eyed him very narrowly, but al-
though he had seen him hundreds of times before,
five years had made too great a change to leave
the boy much chance of recognizing him ; but
wh 'n David came out to get-into the carriage the
youth was no longer at a loss to make out his man.
"Gracious goodness, David McDonald, you've
come home at last, have you? Well, I guess the
folks at home won'tbe sorry to see you, for they'd
near about given you up as a goner! Here these
many weeks your father's been wearing such a
face as made a feller's heart ache but to look at
it! But you aint lookin' dreadful ruggid-guess
vou aint had the easiest times in the world, eh ?"
David could not repress a smile at this quaint
greeting, but the lad - was one who had known
him for years, and the interest which was mani-
fest by his remarks, was upon this long acquain-
tance warrantable, besides Ezekiel Jones, which
was his name, or as he was familiarly known,
"Young Zeke," was the oddity of the village and
neighborhood, and David thought his drolleries
might not have a bad effect upon Wilson at this
time, and his answer but invited the youth to
push the conversation further.
"Yes, Zeke, I've been a lodg time.away-much
longer than I should have been, but for sickness-
I suppose they have been anxious at home-when
did you see my father, Zeke ?"
"I seen him yesterday, he was jest coming' out
of the post office! I thought he must a' earn
something' awful he looked so bad; but when I
asked him, he said 'No, Zeke, not a word from
David yet!' and oh! my, his voice made a feller
feel awful, 'twas a'most as if he'd seen you
dead !"
"Poor Father !" was David's ejaculation, and
then he asked, "are they all well at home, do you
know, Zeke ?"
"Well, yes, I guess all perty tolerable that's
there-they was the last I heard anything said
'bout it !"
"And are not all at home that are there usually?'
"Well, yes, all but Mary, your sister, and you
I guess; I ain't heard of any of the rest being
away !"
Wilson had not seemed particularly interesteZ
in what the boy had to say, but David saw hi
face change in its expression at this last item o
information, and he was not sorry they had hi
upon something which was of importance enoug
to turn him from his own thoughts, besides it wa
such an unusual thing for Mary to be from home
the intelligence surprised him not a little.
"Are you sure Mary is not at home, Zeke?'
was David's inquiry.
"Gracious, yes,I think I ought to be, if there'

wheel, up to your house!'
"And they aint very far from right !" was Da-
vid's earnest answer.; "but do you know where,
my sister has gone, that she stays so long?"
"No, I don't know where it is-Iv'e heard 'um

er, so I wouldn't try to speak it, but its way off

youth glanced at Wilson; "but you must a' earn

can't see where's the hurt of speakin.' She
went off to help take care of that Mr. Farnham;
he's awful sick they say, and the old feller too
who told lies about his wife, they say he ain't

body'll cry when h'a dead."
" Mary gone to take care of Mr. 'Farnham!"
was David's exclamation more to himself than'
to his informant,
Wilson said nothing, but his faced expressed
an impatient anxiety; under other circumstances
he might have hesitated to listen to the town gos-
sip with regard to Mary's movements, but now
information, no matter how.it was gained, must
be had, and he would have asked to hear more,
had not the boy shrewdly guessing he had hit up-
on something the travelers had not yet heard of,
found it impossible to deny himself the luxury
which nearly all of this class so much enjoy-be-
ing the first to tell a startling piece of news. He
was not certain as to who was David's compan--
ion, but the possibility of its being the much
talked of Wilson, made it more impossible for
the boy to leave to another the rare treat of tell-
ing the wonderful story; yet his natural delicacy-
for none in their natural state are destitute of this
property-made him hesitate a little as to how
he was to commence, but it was only for a mo-
ment.
"Why, yes; you see it wasn't such an unnat-
ural thing neither-mother says it wasn't! She
can't have any love for Mr. Farnham, I dare say,
but this son of his'n that everybody takes on so
about-he was amost like a brother to her and
you too! Then the idear of his offering five

that thought folks hadn't got no memories, and
would sry---they always knowed it was all a lie!
Then when this come out 'bout him being the son
of this awful rich Mr. Farnhamn, they wasn't a
bit s'pried, though they could talk of nothing
else from mornin till night; they would declare
anybody that had eyes, might a seed from the
very fust that he belonged to no common breed,
That made mother mad---as though he was any
better fur havin a rich father! Well, here we
are, almost to your gate. No, David McDonald,
you needn't be feelin in your pocket, for I shant
take nothin; I'll be paid next time I see your
father, by one sight of his face. I'll take care of
the things, you both go along."
It was well that their arrival at the McDonald
house brought the loquacious Zeke to a close, for
the subject was one upon which he was not at
all likely to become tired, and both of his com-
panions had lost all disposition to question or in-
terrupt him, for it was very plain to them there
was something very wonderful to be learned, and
they both felt the propriety of waiting to hear it
from those to whom it was a matter of more than
a curious interest.
The reception of these two young men in their
home was too full of heart-felt rejoicing to be
described. ' The father, who had begun to believe
himself bereft of not only their long absent Wil-
lie, but also of the prop of his declining years, his
true-hearted David, wept tears of gladness, while
grandma found it too much for her to bear with
composure, and after one kiss of welcome to each,
she stole into her own room, that none should wit-
ness her struggling with her emotions; and with
the younger members of the family there was no
lack of feeling in their glad greeting.
It was a very long time before any one was
composed enough to speak quietly of the matter
which was weighing upon the minds of all, but
when at last all became more quiet, and Mr. Mc-
Donald, assisted by the boys and Amy, gave Wil-
lie and David a full account of the disclosures
made by Wilson Danforth, their surprise was too
great to adnit of any other emotion for some
time. Suddenly, a new idea seemed to strike
David--
"What did they say of this strange being, fa-
ther-what was his look? Scant gray hair, a
gray beard, and a face that looked as though it
it had been in the grave ?"
"Those were not the words, Davie, but still
very much the same meaning. But why do you
ask so eagerly and so particularly?"  Mr. Mc-
Donald asked this in an eager way.
"Because we have seen him, father. It is the
same, Willie-the same wild being you saved
from  starvation and helped upon his journey!
Don't you'recognize him ? Willie, Willie, I will
never doubt again, that in all things which may
seem to us evil there may be a hidden blessing.
Now I see why we were detained there; why
my illness was necessary, for without- it we
should have been home when this strange man
needed succor-this Wilson Danforth-and he
must have died, and with him all this knowledge
would have perished."
"And but for my poor mother I could I wish it
had !" was Wilson's earnest answer.
"No, my boy, no, no, I can't hear you say this,"
the father answered quickly. "You have seen

enough of the world to know how to use wealth-
if that was the only consideration, but it is not;
you have a sister, the child of your darling mooth-
er, who will soon be left wholly orphaned and
will need a brother's love and proteotion-yi
should thank Heaven that you have learned all
this-for her sake if not for your own !"
"And you will love her so, Willio, for she nm4
be a dear girl-Jemmie says she is beautiful and
so good, and then if she wasn't, she would never
have been willing for old Neptune to have gone
with you on that Christmas morning!   Won't
you bring her soon to see us, Willie? for I shall
never be satisfied till I have seen her-a real he-
roine as she is."
This the enthusiastic Amy said in her own
cheering, loving way, which never failed to inthe
all happier who caie within its influence, and
Wilson began to feel its effect before ho was
aware of it-for this child was indeed a ray of
cheering sunlight in her hemue.
Before the family retired that night, it was
agreed that on the following morning Wilson
should set out on this journey to see his father,
before he should die. His heart rebelled soie-
what at first, but finally he yielded for his sister's
sake; and there was another in that louse aiding
his sister in her duties as nurse, whom his heart
bounded with impatient love to greet once more.
David was to accompany him as far as the city,
should his strength seem suflicient for it When
morning should come.
In this case love proved itself good tonie, and
all were compelled to acknowledge David much
improved by hisuight's rest, and so, without much
opposition, he accompanied Wilson a short dis
tance on his journey. But he felt no dispositi, i
to go beyond the city, and the welcome which he
received from Delia Phelps would have made
him forgetful of ten fold the fatigue le suffered
in his short ride, though it was strange how nuch
nursing and care this tond girl and her mother
found him requiring, and how long a time ie
needed for rest before they could consent to his
venturing to return home.
The day was drawing to a close when the car-
riage containing Wilson stopped at the cottage
gate where terminated his journey. 1Ie looked
anxiously out for soine dear, familiar face to
welcome him, but all was as quiet as had the
cottage containedno living thing. Passing into
the yard, he reached the side door before any one
discovered him.  Then a face was seen at the
window, and before the traveler had time for
thought, the hands of Mary McDontald were
within his own.  Was it strange that for a time
everything else was forgotten in the joy of this
meeting ? Mary was the first to recollect where
they were.
"Come in here, dear Willie" (how   familiar
and sweet that name sounded to her; as she led
the way, she repeated it mentally again and again,
before going on with what she hai to say). As
he seated himself, she laid her hand in his once
more-and now there was something very touch-
ing in the expression of her face, and the move-
ment seemed full of sympathy.
"Have you heard,Willie," she said in little more
than a whisper, "have you heard what has come?"
" What do you mean, Mamy ? ,you need not
fear to speak !

THIS MITHERLESS BAIRN.

"Death was before you, Willie-how I wish
you could have come before; he-your father-
so longed to see you, but he is gone; he died this
morning !"
Wilson leaned his forehead upon the loving
hand which lay within his own. After all there
was a feeling at his heart-not of sorrow-but
this had been his father, and he was dead,-dead
without realizing his one strongest wish-with-
out looking upon his son-the son of her he-had
so cruelly wronged.
Mary's other hand was passed very gently over
his bowed head-the touch, slight as it was,
aroused him-and looking up into her face,.which
was much the same he had left it five years be-
fore, he said:
" My sister.,Mamy, this must be a bitter trial
to her, yet she must even in this hour have a wel-
come for a brother who has so long been a, wan-
derer.- I cannot regret that I am  spared this
meeting with one, who, if living, I know I could
only regard with bitternesi-now that he is dead
all is forgiven. 3ut, my sister. my heart yearns
towards her, Mamy, and I would sootheand com
fort her in this hour.
Mary had no voice to reply by a single word,
but hurrying out of the room she a moment after
re-entered it, accompanied by Henrietta. The
tear-stained face of the latter told that her sor-
row was such as had caused bitter weeping, and
at sight of her brother she found it impossible to
restrain her over-wrought feelings, and long and
passionately she wept; but her tears brought
with them composure, and for the first time in her
life she felt the joy of having a brother.
After a little time Mary stole out of the room,
and left to themselves, the brother and sister
talked of him who had but a few hours since
passed from earth; but their words were gentle,
pitying ones, nothing of bitterness and reproach.
Then Henrietta told her brother of another one,
who waited to see him before leaving the world.
It was the man for whom he had been named-
the man who had done them a great injury, and
at last had been the means of restoring the wan-
deret to his right. Wilson expressed his readi-
ness to visit the bedside of this strange being
withbiut further delay, and as his sister led the
way into the sick room, he peered eagerly at the
bed upon which was stretched the emaciated
form. One glance was enough. David bad
been correct in his conjecture. It was indeed
the same being who had been his guest in his
prairie home! The agitation of the invalid,
when he recognized in his name-sake the young
man who had saved. his life when he was near
perishing from fatigue and hunger, made both his
watchers tremble for the result, but after a time
he rallied-his hour had not yet come.
While these two were in the .ick chamber,
James McDonald, accompanied by Mr. Phelps,
returned from the neighboring town, where'they
had been to make all necessary arrangements for
the burial, which in accordance with Mr. Farn-
ham's request was to take place in this quiet
country town, where had passed the last few
months of his life, and where he had been hum-'
bled to the very dust. When told by Mary-who
met them before they reached the cottage door-
of Wilson's arrival, Mr. Phelps' inquiring res-
ponse was

"And David ?"
"Is safely cared for by your wife and daugh-
ter!" was Mary's answer.
"Then we may indeed rejoice ;" was the earn-
est reply.
"We will not even complain by wishing they
had come sooner--poor Willie, he has been spared
a sad trial and he has had enough of them, so let
us not regret it!," Both Mr. Phelps and Mamy
felt to say "amen" to this brotherly sentiment
from James, and then Wilson himself appearing
at the door, both turned their attention to him.
Ere another day dawned death had the'second
time entered the cottage, and these old men, who
had in life been mortal enemies, were laid to their
last rest on the same day, by the hands of those
who had most severely suffered by their evil doings,
and these two were their only mourners.
One.year from this time, there was gathered
in the snug farm home of David McDonald a
joyous party-a three-fold wedding party!  Wil-
son Farnham-the wealthy and courted-claim-
ed from this dearly loved circle for his bride, the
quiet, gentle Mary whom he had loved since first
his eyes rested upon her little child-face. And
proud was he of bestowing his sister upon the
manly James, who had taken good care to win
the heart of her he had long loved. As to the
third pair it would not be difficut to guess who
they were,:when Delia Phelps' promise to David
-to give him her hand whenever he should ask it,
so he who had so cruelly suffered by her brother,
was there to witness the bands-shall be recall-
ed! The news of the death of this unhappy
brother had, however, compelled David to mas-
ter his impatience for a year's delay.
His bride was not all that the young farmer
won by the long search after the lost Wilson-by
right the five thousand dollars reward belonged to
him, and he did not refuse to take it. Wilson
and Henrietta could well spare double that sum
from their abundance, but this was all that he
would receive.
Among all of the party there was much of curi-
osity to see the bridal gift which W ilson had for his
sister. David evidently knew what it was, for
he would give a very conscious look whenever it
was spoken of, but to not even Delia did he be-
tray the secret, for, as he told her, it was not his.
Of one thing they were certain-for size it was
not diminutive, for it required a box almost large
enough to contyia the young man himself to hold
it. Henrietta was not the least curious one of the
company, but she forbore questioning, and when
the moment came and the cover was removed
from the case, displaying her dear old Neptune,that
she had never ceased to remember with fondness,
the swelling of her loving heart, would not allow
her to speak her thanks-but her brother read all
she would have spoken in her affectionate eyes,and
he felt that his noble sister appreciated the act-
that to her the gift was of more value than could
have been any other, no matter how costly.
And after this life of severe trial, he who had
nearly seventeen.years before sought the grave
of his darling mother to die-he who had felt
himself homeless, friendless, motherless, was bless-
ed with home and friends and enough of this
world's goods, but what he valued more than all
p he rest ten times told-with the love of his true-
hearted wife.
