IN one of the pleasantest countries in this world were two great farms. They lay side by side, but were cut off from all other lands by a wide river, too deep for fording, and which  gave the dwellers on these farms an advantage over others, by separating them from numerous quarrels. It would have been fortunate, if the people who thus lived by themselves had been able forever to keep from quarelling with each other. No description could overrate the beauty and value of the broad lands which these farms occupied. There were hills, green valleys, and wide-stretching plains, everywhere holding a rich soil, which only waited for the hand of the laborer to make it blossom forth like a new Paradise. There were, also, thick woods: there were many and clear-running streams. Indeed, it seemed to hold within itself the natural treasures of all lands. There was not much difference between these two farms. But over one of them was often blowing a cold wind from the mountains, which chilled the air, and was said by some to chill the people that lived arong there, and make them cold- hearted; so this was called the "North Farm." Its neigh- bor, the "South Farm," did not feel these cold winds, but   ;i        '! i tH i N W Jt'AKSMr  the sun shone down warm upon it, and seemed also to warm the hearts that felt its rays. All-the people living on these estates were farmers, and they were also near family connections. The old mansion, whence most of them came, and which each one considered his own property, was standing about half-way between the extreme northern and southern'boundary line. In this house lived an old gentleman, the only patriarch of the numerous families; the one from whom each settler had received a title  to his own particular house-lot and farm, and the one to whom each looked to settle all disputes that came up amongst them- selves. In fact, the only condition which the old man had insisted on, as each one came for his land-deed, was, that he himself should decide all their quarrels. Rather shrewd that in him, and a very good thing, too, for all his family, as will- be seen hereafter. A: alth:e'settlers were in 'some way related to this old maniand some two or three of them, when talking together, were often speaking of their Uncle Sam, and the way he did this or that, by and by every one said "Uncle Sam;" that was his name. Uncle Sam was in some respects a strange person. It sometimes think he was cold-hearted, and did not feel very  warmly about anything. But perhaps it was best that he should keep a cool head among such a number of young peo- , pie, differing in their temper and reasonings, and who often  needed, a wiser person to speak and act for them. When the  old man was young, and 'his little family were growing up around him, he had been reading the newspapers pretty much all the time, and his head was full of the notions which he found there.: You would have thought so, to hear the names he gave his children. Certainly nowhere but in a newspaper   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        5 could he have picked up such strange ones. There were Star," "Granite," "Mountain," "Baystate," "Empire," "Keystone," "Dominion," "Palmetto," "Buckeye," "'Prairie," "Border," and so on, and so on, a good many more. They are curious names, to be sure. But let the old man alone. If a human being has any right that he considers inborn, it is this one-to give his children what names he pleases. I said there were two farms; and so there were, but this division had been made only a few years. When the land was first settled, there was no line of separation, in imagi- nation or reality; there was then no North and no South about it, and the cause of this distinction afterwards was one of the strangest that ever existed. Pray, lay aside your prejudices while you read the story. Imagine all the land to have, been one very large, hand some estate, owned by the above-mentioned old gentleman, with the young and enterprising family. Each young man, when he had married a wife, and built a house, went directly to work as fast as ,e could, fencing in his land, cutting down trees, draining the swamps, and laying down the different lots to whatever crops should be best adapted to the soil. The years went by, and he Was busy as ever. In the spring he ploughed and planted, in the summer he made his hay, in the autumn he harvested the fruit of his labors, and in the winter he took his ease.. The land well repaid aft this toil. Each year the seed that was buried in the ground came up in good time; the sun and the rains warmed and watered it, and at harvest time there was no lack of wheat or corn in the barn, nice fruits and vegetables for the household eating, or plenty of home-spun garments for the household wear. 1I   6         THE NEW FARMS. But it is said that every family, however happy, has its skeleton. What was it here? I say again, listen without prejudice, or question of its truth. - For though you never before heard such a strange story, yet it is true, never- theless. Just one little thing began. at that time to cause trouble. From some of the most fruitful portions of the land, there had been complaints of thistles getting in with the grain. It was what farmers hereabout call the "Canada Thistle." What business this pest had on that fine farm nobody could tell. It was not there when the country was first settled, and all agreed that it came from one of the outside farms. But each year, as it became still more troublesome, the question, "Who brought this plague to our land?" was more often asked than answered. Back and forth, one accused another of do- ing it. When it was really found necessary to do something about it, those farmers who had settled along the line to the north took hold in earnest, and, by ploughing and mowing their lands regularly for successive years, were able to clear out every one.  Then, every tongue was discussing the best remedy for this evil; for evil it was called at that time. Key- stone offered a premium for the best mode of removing them. Some made experiments.  One of Empire's children went boldly into a patch of thistles,. and planted his corn amongst them; then, when he went through his ground to hoe his corn, he pulled up every weed, root and branch, shook the earth from it, and left it in the sun to die. One said, "Scatter salt on them in the right time of the moon."  One said, "Cut them down close to the ground, pile up the branches, and burn them," But it was found that the broken roots bore new shoots, and the work must be done over   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        7 again. Another laid down his fields to grass for several years, watching each plant as it appeared, and pulling it up. One took them when they were about to bloom in summer, and cut them down over and over again with his scythe. Another waited till the heat and drought of August came, and the weed was fully grown; then its stalks were hollow, some of its leaves dead, and the plough, following deep and often through the grain-fields, did effectual work. Some tried salting, some mowing, burning, ploughing, dig- ging, grubbing, and so on. Keystone owned a very handsome place, and, to make sure of doing the work thoroughly, he and his children went over the ground with a mattock, and the sharp blades cleared it out well. All the farmers worked so steady just at that time, that the prospect was good of soon having all the great farm wholly free. But, to the surprise of all, the thing stopped just half way. Whether the hot sun of the Southern settlers shone down so powerfully that they did not like to work in it, or whether the little things had multiplied so fast it was not easy getting rid-of them, is not known. The fact only stands, and we are to see what a trouble came of it. One circumstance, that may or may not have had anything to do with this loss of zeal, shall be recorded. I said it was the Canada Thistle which had scattered itself so fast over the lands and held firm possession. But in company with it were plenty of briars and thorns, and also other kinds of thistles, some of them harmless perhaps, but all these burrs, as they were often called, held the place of good useful corn. It is of one of these harmless thistles, known as the "Cotton Thistle," that the following fact occurred. About the time when the sun was shining down the hottest and the farmer was becoming faint over his work, some one   THE NEW FARMS. aade the discovery that the white down of this thistle would nake an excellent staple for the weaving of some light cloth -lighter and cheaper every way, than the' coarse fax which the farmers' families had been working upon in their looms. The thing took immediately. This nice white cloth was woven instead of flax, and the thorns and thistles-well, they seemed  to grow faster after that. Years went by, and the Northern settlers generally took no notice how thb people Southward were doing their farm- ing. For themselves, they sowed, reaped, traded off their corn, and, as they grew richer, cared less for the pros- perity of any body else. They took an interest in the curious cotton thistle that was so useful. Ma y of them were sharp and wide-awake in earning money, so that, before long they had in their own hands all the jobs for weaving up the new cloth that was wanted. Farming and weaving too,brought in one dollar after another, fast; and every year, as the pile of dollars grew higher, they smiled, felt what a good thing it was to be industrious, and went to work again. And while the farmers were so busy, Uncle Sam took it into his head to buy some land. Were any one to know how many acres the old man then owned, they would think he ought to have been satisfied; his family never could want mora. Never mind for that. All that can be said is, he was something like other heads of families. No sooner was this land bought, than the family were called Uncle Samn never dSid any, together to talk over the matter. Uncle Sam never did any thing of consequence without consulting his family about it; : that must be put to his credit. Indeed, the old gentleman's  talking over matters with them and deciding their differ- ences, was really only his way of keeping them from openly a, was  A 'IUItX J'UIt JFARiVMEiti.  quarrelling. He made up his mind just as they did, and al- ways intended to carry out their wishes. At this time, as soon as they were together, they all began to talk at once, and to talk about the same thing. It was the thistle question that had come up to disturb the family peace. The farmers who had cleared them off their own ground, insisted that they should never be allowed to grow on the new land. But the other farmers thought of the hot sun, and how unpleasant it was to work in; and they had some pride and fear lest any of their children, who might want to settle on the new land, would never go if there was a prospect of hard work. It is also possible that they had the profitable cotton thistle in mind. Any way, it was agreed on all hands, now as they had always done, that their Uncle Sam's farm was the very best taken care of in the world; that these thistles and briars did not amount to much; and that be- fore long they would die out of themselves. All this land that had been bought lay alongside the north- ern part of this estate, toward the west, and the thistle farmers finally said :-"Just give us one farm only, that southern cor- ner, where tlistles may grow or not, just as it happens: here is a man, Border, wants to settle oh it now ; and all the rest of the new land on your side shall be kept clear of them forever. We will give you our solemn promise on this. And, to make it sure to you, we will put up stakes all along botwon thia farm and those that shall be kept clear forever. So here is our promise and agreement on it." Now the no-thistle farmers did not like this very well, for they could not see the use of having thistles on good, new land, when they could just as well be kept out. But they were not quite so spirited as the others in setting forth their case and then it is not impossible that cotton-thistle was in   10         THE NEW FARMS. their minds too, and made their voices faint. Any way, the bargain was made. They. shook hands upon it, and Uncle Sam agreed to it. The stakes were put up; and this long line, which was going to mark two different kinds of farming, they began to speak of as the "Promise-line;" .a word which afterward became quite well known among the settlers. With these opposite ways of cultivating the land, as you may suppose, there was soon such a difference in the appear- ance of the thistle and no-thistle farms, that the settlers seemed as much separated as they would have been if the fence built upon the new land had been continued eastward, through the middle of the old farm, to the water. Thus have I told you the way in which that large handsome estate seemed to be divided; and now we see these two great farms were themselves divided into smaller ones, each occupied by a settler's family. More years went by, and the northern settlers were as industrious as ever, and looked closely after that growing pile. But some few among them were not satisfied with this selfish way of doing things. They remembered what a broad, handsome estate it all was when first settled; they saw how rich those were getting who had redeemed their own farms; and off toward the south they saw how alarmingly the thing was spreading over the land. They were longer-headed far- mers than their neighbors were-or at least they thought they were-and so began to speak out with loud voices:- Those farmers will certainly go to ruin, unless they clear away those thistles."  Well, even among their neighbors, these speakers did not get many thanks for their pains; but still they kept on, talk- ing louder still, and finally made such a noise that their relations toward the south heard it, and stopped to, listen.   "+ --      A STORY FOR FARMERS.        " You remember, those southern settlers were warm-blooded, and they were also proud. They said not a word for a time; but when the voices came much louder to their ears, telling them what they ought to do, they turned square around one day and said:-"Hold your tongues! No more meddling with our business. We'll have thistles, if we want to; we will always have them, if we choose. We like them. They are good things for the best kind of farms. We will have them, so stop talking!" "Canada thistles good things for the best kind of farms! Why, we sue a neighbor who does not root up the thistles upon his land!" cried out a man that lived on one of those foreign farms across the water, who had none of consequence on his own land, and therefore had no right to judge for other people. Now, one word concerning those same outside people. It was said that their-land had been so long settled, it was not quite as good as new ;that the people had old fashioned notions about tilling land; that sets of men would get together and agree to make other men do farming just according to their own notions, whether they wanted to or not; in fine, though they had not the Canada thistle on their lands, they had a miserable show of weeds and briars, that had so long held possession, nobody believed they could be rooted up. And did it become such farmers to laugh at these over the water? Besides, there were certain reasons for not believing in the sincerity of those foreign people whenever they made any remarks about our farmers. It was thought they had had a hand in bringing those same thistles over the water, and planting them on this good farm. Perhaps, too, they were jealous of neighbors who were getting on so fast in the world. Certainly, there were one or two cases wherein no good will was shown. I.                 ,   But among that people, more interesting to us at present, an unhappy state of things had come about. They were farther apart in their ways and in their good feelings. The people on the South farm could not stop the talking every- where about their way of farming,-and truly there were reasons why all the settlers had a right to talk about it, and not be told they were meddling with other people's busi- ness. It had been a very great pity that years before, when each farmer was wide-awake, and working hard to be rid of these things, some one had not taken hold and weeded the old homestead lot. This was the spot, of all others, that each man called his own. It was where, every year or two, Uncle Sam called them up to counsel about disputed questions; so that here, those that believed in thistles, and those that did not, had for years been seeing them grow right under their own eyes. Said a thistle farmer one day, "What's the harm of such pretty things as these round a house? We like to see them, and our children like to play with them. I reckon these things are much better for them to be amused with, than what your children have, who go round knocking their heads against your hard rocks, and come out into the world rough enough. Anyhow, we'll keep our thistles, and you may keep your rocks." Well, there was not much of any answer to such words as these. The no-thistle farmers began to be afraid of pricking their, fingers if they meddled too much with the thorny question. But two or three of them seemed to be sitting upon nettles the whole time they were visiting Uncle Sam. At home, it was a subject that would be talked over by one and another occasionally. It had been finally agreed on that   thistles were first brought over the water and planted in their lands by one of those foreign farmers. So that there was somebody else on whom the blame, at the beginning, could be laid, and that seemed a little relief. But pray, how did it help the matter? There was a man once who ate an apple which made him very sick, but it did not seem to make him get any better, when he charged his wife (as they say he did most decidedly) with giving him the apple. Not satisfied with all the other ways of looking at this sub- ject, somebody one day brought up the Bible to prove his side of the case. Now some farmer may say, "Surely people now-a-days can know what are the best crops for any field without the aid of Bible authority. It was very well for the Jews to be told all these little things, but I learned that this- tles would ruin any piece of ground, the first day I put on pantaloons." Stop, friend! Not a word more. You must belong to one of the foreign farms, and therefore know nothing of this pecu- liar soil; therefore, you do not know what crops are best fit- ted to it, or what advice it is best to give. Is not the Bible the best of books? But let us listen to those who looked thoroughly into the question, and sifted the whole thing to the bottom. Those who liked thistles said that the Bible was .full of verses about this difficult question; that the book was all standing out, and, as it were, bristling all over with thorns and thistles. Did it not tell of sowing wheat and reaping thorns? And in the New Testament, is there a single com- mand against thorns and thistles? Did not some of the seed fall among thorns? Also; somewhere in the Bible there was a vineyard of which it says, (the verse was read, that there 2   should be no mistake about it,) "And lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof." Did not such passages show that thorns and thistles were in the world in the beginning; and that very likely they would always be in it? Troublesome things, like as some sins were, but it was best to follow good advice, and let the this- tles and the wheat grow together, till some day when these differences and troubles would come to an end; when the Great Reaper, with more skilful hand than theirs, would, in his own way, bring good out of evil. Amiong those who had a word to say onthe other side of the Bible argument was sister Rhoda, who was smaller than her brothers, but had the advantage of a good heavy voice,; so she was allowed to speak:-  "No, to be sure, it could not be said that there was any command against a man's having thorns and thistles on his own land.  But it was true that whenever, in the Bible, the seed was sown among thorns, it was also shown that these things always hurt the crops. In truth, thistles, which were the particular cause of the present dispute, were mentioned but once or twice in the Bible. When the good Job spoke of them, he clearly understood them to be sent as a kind of pun- ishment; saying that if he should ever do one or two certain wicked things, then ' Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.'?' It was Palmetto who had the last word in this argument and when he spoke he was fuller and happier than ever before for he knew that this time he had the case. "He would add but a single word to what had gone before and every reasonable person would be convinced. It had truly been said that thistles were mentioned in the Bible bu once or twice; and one of these verses had been quoted   But nothing ever exceeded the unfairness and weakness of an adversary who could repeat the very verse which would help his own cause, and leave unnoticed the one which would knock over every stone of the underpinning that supported the log- ical structure thus erected. "It had been acknowledged on both sides that there was no positive command against any man having thistles on his own land if he chose. But still further, there was a positive command by One greater than Job, or any other good man ever heard of; and it was right at the beginning of the good book, standing there like a grand foundation-stone, whereon to build a solid argument of authority for all future genera- tions. It was in these words: 'Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. 'Thorns also, and thistles shall it bring forth to thee.'" Thus ended the argument; what more could be said? Ir   CHAPTER   II. FARMERS, do you wish to know what the thistles themselves were doing all this while? They were growing, growing with '1l their might, spreading themselves here, there, everywhere. And wherever they once began to grow, it was wonderful what a power they had of keeping possession, and to what an amazing depth the roots sometimes reached.  You may be sure that when 'they were growing so fast, they did not mind fences or stone walls, or whether they lived on the farm or road-sides; in good, rich loam, or dry and stony i ground; but night and day, in storm and sunshine, the purple iowery vld i i-p their ronaTnd eAfa tana  ctlty+a v;r anof. .A war amid all the hubbub going on about them. A pasture filled with them, waving and dancing in the wind, was rather a pretty sight; especially on a sunshiny day, when butterflies with bright colors made the picture a gay one. Everybody that looked at it was pleased, and forgot the evil that was going on away down at the root. But these same breezes that blew over the thistle-fields, sometimes blew a little stronger than usual, and thence came  one of the worst troubles of the whole matter. Then the winged, downy seeds were caught up, and flew everywhere. They did not heed who wanted them to go or who wanted  them to stay. On they flew, over the fences, over farms, over hills; and, listen now, they flew over into the free farms. In   A STORY FOR FARMERS.       17 fact, they often seemed rather to like these farms better than their own; so they settled down wherever the free winds of heaven lodged them. I need not tell you how fast this circumstance brewed mis- chief between the settlers, for you can see it yourself with "half an eye. And the farmers' families, how were they looking, and what had they been doing all this time? They had been growing, too, all over the land. They were no longer poor settlers, each with his little family, struggling to live-one on a poor, stony lot, which he ploughed and sweat over that it might yield a scanty harvest-or another working in the wet swamps to make his farm healthy and habitable-or another commencing his clearing in the thick woods, with the courage and vigor of a1 strong right arm, but before the first year passed away sick with days and nights of fever. Such had been the hard work, the care and the suf- 'fering of their younger days. But they had outlived it, no man seemed to know how, and now other times had come. It was like magic, the wonderful change! Each settler had his grown-up family of sons and daughters, tall, strong, cheerful at heart, each feeling himself great and good as anybody; each working day by day and year by year, and making the whole air echo with the noise of their busy labors, and each thus helping to make his own family farm and the whole big farm more beautiful, richer, greater, better than any other farm in the world. This they aimed at -surely this was a worthy ambition-but would they ever reach it? We must wait and see. These young sons and daughters had been thus growing up and settling down on their father's estate, each upon a place he could call his own, as his father had done before him. 2*   18         TH NEW. FARMS. They were strong, they were industrious, and they looked into the future for great things.. Would they escape the sin of their fathers, who lived too much for money? I cannot tell you what a smiling, fertile country this land became under the labor of these busy bees. It would make too long a story. But the whole truth must be told. The farms that had no thistles on them had far outstripped the others. The land itself showed a great difference. I cannot explain the cause, but probably you farmers understand it, why these thistles seem to blight the soil, and make it in a few years unfit for tilling, so that it was easier to take new land and begin laboring again, than try to work upon the old. Then, the dwellers on these farms were said not to be as steady in their habits; and they had not made a hundredth part as valuable improvements in the new machines and tools which the skilful husbandmen of the other farms found so useful, and which increased their property every year. Still the southern farmers were the most kind-hearted. Of course the thistle did not make them so. They were kind- hearted naturally. They were also frank and hospitable; opening their house and spreading their table for the stranger, while the northern people often left him standing at the door so long, that he knew not what to make of it, and went away thinking very soberly about human nature. But something came up about this time that seemed to change the people of the South farm. Their warmth of heart became warmer still, became over-heated, and sometimes grew to fierce anger. Was it these thorns and briars that were pricking them? Or was there poison in the air wher- ever these things grew, that worked like fire in the blood, and so when the hour of temptation came, its fury could not be stayed? i   A STORY FOR FARMERS.       19 Whoever explains it, will know why they always carried knives with them, hidden somewhere, but ready at the moment when those flames kindled up, to strike quick and deadly; yes, even if it were a brother who fell. And sometimes, too, the Northern farmers could see these knives shining, and they could not get used to them. They never had carried any, and did not like the sight of them; so, shaking with fear, they yielded this and that, in fine, pretty much every thing that was asked, specially about thistle-farming. Those thistle-farmers managed most shrewdly. They had found out that the families on the North farm were all very much attached to their Uncle Sam, and that the farmers were fond of meeting together, once in a year or two, in the old homestead. So, what do these managers do, but work upon this weakness, and whenever it served their turn, threaten a separation of the whole family bond. Like an indulged wife, who having found out the weak side of her husband's heart, would be continually threatening him with getting a divorce from bed and board, if he would not grant some darling wish. So with these thistle-farmers. They had contrived to fix everything their own way, and, by always going together, and saying they would have it so, and all the people on the farm should have it so, in the end, they did have it their own way. It was in the yearly meetings at the old homestead when their Uncle called them together, that the disputes mostly took place, and the thorny question would often come up when a body least expected. It was wonderful, turn which- ever way they might, how one of these thistle-heads would spring up; and, when one was cut off, up would come another right in its place, fretting and wounding any one that touch- ed it.   20         THE NEW FARMS. As these years went by, Uncle Sam had been growing older ; and then he felt poorer, and then he got more land, till the whole estate was three times as great as the first that he had owned. Surely then his children need not go a begging. This estate now reached along the northern boundary line to another great river on the west, like that one on the east. It was not square, for the southern boundary line did not reach more than half way westward, whence the line went crooking up toward the north-west. No one can ever say how the tangled underbrush which this mass of briers and thorns made, would ever have been got through by these farmers, provided they had never come in possession of more land than they owned at first. Sure enough it was that the fires of discord now burned up hotter than before. They threw the prickly thistles back and forth into each other's faces at every turn. The fiery southern farmers managed well. Each man of them on the point of his sharp knife stuck a thistle-blossom. This meant that, for all time to come, whenever the thorny question came up, he would be as true to that cause as any man ever was to the woman he loved; that nobody in this life should separate him from it; that he would fight for it to the death. (I think I have heard of people fighting for a red and a white rose; but never before have I heard of fighting about thistles.) Yes, these men really thought that thistles were good things' on the best of farming lands. Here and there, to be sure, was one less zealous; but with all of them, their blood was up, and they vowed to stand or fall together for the great cause of thistle-farming. Nay, more! They vowed to fight together for thistles on all the new land.   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        21 Now, the families on the other farm were not half enough awake to this sort of managing. They had scarcely looked at the new land. Or when they thought of it, they knew that all which lay along in the same line with themselves was fenced up by that old Promise-line; and that old line had been considered about as well settled as the steady line of the sun through the heavens above them. If they ever went to bed at night tired of the endless din about thistles, or waked up in the morning praying they might not hear the word during the coming day, in every moment of anxiety, there was a feeling of solid comfort in remembering the old Promise- line. Thinking of that, they felt stronger than the sailor does when holding to his anchor; for an anchor is not a fixture, but sometimes the winds draw it forcibly out of its fastenings, and sometimes it is changed from one place to another, at will. But this Promise-line! Well, in the strong-hold of their hearts it was held so firm, theyqhad no more thought it would ever be touched, than that the big river rolling along the eastern side of their farm nrnnil woah . n. .. .- -. -. ^..- - -- ....... ......    ,.j ovuwe rocky moun- tain by years of trying. So they had always gone to bed at night, and waked up in the morning, and every day com- menced their farming or their profitable weaving, feeling thankful that one thing in this world was settled, and that was, this same Promise-line. Well, one day when they were together at the old home- stead, all at once, after managing and threatening, the thistle- farmers gained over enough of the others to carry their point, and with many voices declared the old Promise-line should be broken up forever. Then, lest any who had joined them in saying so should change his mind, frightened at what had been done, they hurried to pull up the stakes they themselves had set up, smoothed over the line, so that no trace of it   22        THE NEW FARMS. could be seen, and then pleasantly turned round and said, "There, every thing is all right; no line of division between us; now we will go on quietly, side by side, forever." The coolness with which this treacherous act was done, was not greater than the wonder and fear with-which all the ,Northern families heard it. The first news came to them as the sound of a funeral bell. The act had been done before they woke up to know what was going on, and to think what; a great wrong it was. Then they saw through the whole.  "What! brothers of our own family to make a solemn promise like that, and as soon as they are strong enough, break it? Long ago, they ate up their share of the dinner, and when we, who have been waiting half starved for ours, come, with mouths watering, to the feast, they knock away  the dishes from us, and say with a smile, ' O, it is no matter now, 'tis just as well without it.' No, but it is not just as well without it. This is no brotherly act. No relations of : ours, unless they behave as relations should. This is shame- ful; it is wrong; it is lying, cheating roumlg. i- And sotthe mutterings went on and on, as one and another heard the news. Louder and deeper the sound grew. there had been plenty of talking before among some few of them.  This was more like a waking up at last. When troubles are drawing near to some crisis, all the events connected therewith tread fast upon each other, like one cloud chasing another quickly when the thunder storm is  coming. This throwing up of the well known Promise-line looked at something more definite than pulling down a fence. I have not told you what great travellers these families  were. They liked to be coming and going, and they liked a great deal of elbow-room. Sometimes they liked to settle down where they could not see any neighbor, and could own -   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        23 all the land around. This explains why new land was wanted C so fast. And at this time, there were some farms to be laid out immediately on the new land. Again the matter was talked over, as to how the farms should be marked out, and what farmers should settle upon them. But the side which had gained so great a victory as i to take back a promise after it had been made, thus getting 1 both halves of a bargain, would not, when flushed with suc- i cess, fail in an easier matter. The thistle party carried the, day. They declared that Uncle Sam should not meddle at all, but that, if thistles should blow over there, or if any one chose to carry some there with his other property, or if he should chance to find some there already growing, nobody I should do any thing about it. The whole thing should be let alone, and those who settled on the farms might each follow whichever kind of farming he should prefer. At the same time, it was said there need be no concern; but few thistles i would ever get there. I do not know whether those who did not believe in thistle- farming believed this last story or not.  I rather think most of them understood such talking. Still, enough of them were found to go with the thistle-farmers once more. These new farms, thus quickly marked out for a place alongside the older ones, are those which my story, in the be- ginning, was designed to tell you about. The rest of the story may seem stranger to you who are reading it, than what has gone before.  I think I hear some of you saying, "Stop a little, do not impose on our common sense.  All of us know that the thistle will sometimes get possession of farms that are not looked after, and it is about as much as the place is worth to get rid of it. Every good practical man knows this. But when you tell us of men that are called farmers wanting to   24        THE NEW FARMS. have it grow, and liking it, and planting it with their grain in new land, well, you are telling us rather a hard story, unless the men were crazy." Well, farmers, it is a strange story, but it is a true one. A thing never looks just the same to a man, when he himself is. doing it, as whenA another man is doing it. Had you been among these farmers, used to seeing thistles growing up like crops of grain, while, year after year, anger and hot words about it were growing up still faster, you cannot say what you would have done. You might have been crazy, too. For the present, the visitors at Uncle Sam's house had noth- ing more to talk about. The old man found out what most of them wanted, said it should be so, and sent them home to their families. Now some of these farmers lived a great many miles off from the old mansion, and of course did not get home as soon as those who lived nearer. But one half of them had barely time to reach home, and kiss their wives and children, before one little movement was made, which has a good deal to do with our story. Young Emigrant, a boy living on a northward farm, jumped out of bed one morning, with the bright idea that he would go and settle on these new farms just laid out. Perhaps he was like the other young fellows, fond of travelling, and wanted to see something of this world besides houses, roads and fences; had become tired of near neighbors, and would rather have foxes for company than men. Or, perhaps, there is no truer way to explain his motions than to say, that he had been dreaming very hard that night, and never in his life was so wide-awake as on that morning when he started up with that notion in his head. Off he was directly. His hopes were high, his heart was light, his step was springy, as he went   A STORY FOR iARMhS.       25 singing along the road. He had his axe upon his shoulder, and, because of the wild beasts in that region, he put a knife in his belt. He did not know much about the country whither he was going, but his fancy was blight. He said little to the rela- tives whom he met on the Way, but day after day travelled with the sun on towards the west. What rich, handsome Farms he passed! How happy and comfortable looked the houses! How thick and heavy was the grain growing in the fields! How busy all the people were! "Well, these are not thistle farms," he kept thinking. : So I'll have a farm with no burrs on it." The last farm he passed, Border owned. There young Emigrant saw some thistles growing; but he did not conclude to change his mind about his own farm. A little farther on, through woods and wild lands. At last he was there upon the new farms. A nd what kind of a place did he find to set- tle upon? Let any show a better in this world! ,The winding stream that ran toward the east he called his northern boundary line, and it would serve as a highway for many a day till he needed a better to travel on. The tall, rich grass, growing without any care, proved the soil he had chosen was good. Upon a little knoll, from which the land sloped away handsomely, so that the better part of the farm could be seen from it, he would build his house. As large a portion of land around it as he could attend to, he would put to tillage. The pasture land should be the other side. Down along the river were the rich meadows, plenty of grass-land everywhere, and the wood-lot only a little farther off. "There's none of those other rich farms will quite equal this," he said, after he looked it all over. "Won't I show them something worth seeing before long." 3   7   26         THE NEW FARMS. I             is! *  '  '1  * . i Tired as he was with his journey, these were pleasant plan-  nings for young Emigrant; and, as the sun was going down in the West, he felt a new pleasure in thinking that he was  alone. There were quarrellings and fightings enough going on, away off in the world, wherever men were living together. But there-it was silence-a peace and a silence that had lived there forever. The winds blew fresh from these mysterious regions upon his tired body, as he lay down to sleep for the first time on i the spot where his home was to be. He moved a stone under-  neath his head for a pillow, as one good man did years ago;  If this young sleeper was often inclined to dream, what a  place that was for it!  But the silent night moved steadily by, and again the o bright sun came up in the East to waken him. Happy, and  with new strength, he jumped up to begin his first day's work.  He was no sluggard. "What! What is that moving down by the meadows? What? It is a man. A man here! On my farm! What does this mean?' said Emigrant, pretty wide awake then. Sure enough it was a man moving along as if he had just come up beside the stream and was looking eagerly at the promising farm just described. The two men saw each other at the same moment, and each stood still looking. Emigrant thought fast that time. In a minute he saw through it all, no question about it. There stood a thistle farmer as wide awake as he, come to, settle upon this same jrm. There could be no mistaking A him, for down from his belts hung the sharp knife, with a flower upon its point; and a row of thistles were strunguupon his arm, ready to plant with his other seed.   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        27 It seems they had both come a long journey for the same purpose; each intending to be the first settler upon the new farms. Well, this farm was too large for one man; there was more of it than could be seen just around. Why should they not both come, go to work peaceably, and see which would show the best farms to their relatives in a few years? Why?  Young Emigrant knew why.   Both travellers knew why it could not be. No such half-way work about farming would answer. And it would have been better had this been seen earlier and clearer in that last meeting of the older farmers at the homestead. The blunder, or rather the shameful negligence was the fault of a few men from the North farm. They knew what a wretched evil this thing was. There was not one of them who would have had it on his own farm. They knew that this evil had been the chiefest of their troubles in all their family relations, threatening to sep- arate them forever. I They knew, too, that if they had only said the word all together, they could have good farms as well as bad ones, for they outmambered the others. They bad meanly shirked the danger and threw it upon these young and innocent settlers. They were guilty, guilty of the inno- cent blood that would be shed. Could they ever wash their hands of it? ' Was it fear that had made them weak? Surely it is better to die than always to yield to the fear of dying. They should have taken knives, too, and said, "kill us if you dare, but you shall not be always threatening us!" Those threatening men were, after all, of the same family. They were only blind with passion and what seemed to them self-interest. They knew not what they were doing.   28         THE NEW FARMS. Those two first comers on the new farms said but little to  each other. What was there to say? Each went to work on a piece of ground, and waited for the present. Emigrant's bright dreaming was over, as you may suppose. Now these two young farmers, though they had each left home rather secretly, did not get away without their relatives knowing it, and spreading the news. Soon, on either side, one and another young fellow also wanted to go to the new farms; and not many days afterward, there was quite a little company of settlers, with their wives and sisters, on the road  across the North farm, bound for the promised land. Over the South farm, too, was a party travelling in the same direction, but there were no wives or sisters in it; or not more than one or two. Before these young families had moved thither, no one had thought of looking to see where the new farms were, or of asking what sort of a place it was whereon to settle. Now,  all eyes were in that' direction, and ears were opened to hear it described. They took out their plans of the whole estate, d and to their surprise, saw how much Uncle Sam really owned.  These new farms (which, after all, were but part ofa great wilderness beyond, also owned by the old gentleman), these farms just opened for. settlers, that had heretofore been talked of as a great wood-lot, fit only for wild animals, were seen to be, following round by the outside boundary lines, full as large as all the first settled farms put together. They were  made up" of prairies waving' with tall grass, grand lonely woods, and clear-winding streams, in which, as they moved slowly along, the sun every day made pictures of the green hills that stood around, and the blue clouds that hung above. Truly, it was a great garden, which had been kept fair and    A STORY FOR FARMERS.        29 untouched by any hand but that which planted it in the beginning. Looking at the plans, it was also seen that these farms occupied just the centre or heart of the whole estate. Could the heart of any man beat through the pulses of his body with more power, than did the bleeding struggles of that central land shake the frame-work of that numerous family? The young settlers worked on so busy and steady that, for a time, the prospect was quite encouraging. There really seemed a disposition on either side to take care of their own individual homes, and let each one see which could, by so doing, show the best farming; at least, try the experiment of working side by side, and see if they could get along so. Perhaps in the end they might have agreed to keep the farms free from this evil. But could it have been some Satan who was angry that there should even be a prospect of peace in this fair garden, and came in just at the moment when he could destroy it? If it were some such character, he entered the garden this time in human form. There was no cheating about it. The sun shone on it. Perhaps you have noticed that when a family, or two or three of its members, live entirely separate from other people, the warm social feelings that ought to come out, have no chance to be used, and are rusted over with spite and ill-will. They become, hard-hearted persons, losing love for their kind; and if their home happens to be chosen in the wild woods, which only beasts inhabit, ten to one they may at heart grow like these beasts, fierce and cruel. Now Border had in his family some sons, either badly brought up or uncommonly inclined to evil ways. It was said that one of these sons had paid a visit to the mansion-house, 3*   gV        THE NEW FARMS. and actually sat in a chair at the right hand of the old gentle- man. But it scarcely seems likely that one who had sat in so respectable a seat as that, could ever do such dirty work as 'this son did. Besides these sons, there were other miserable characters, hangers-on of the family, who were nothing but idle hands on the farm. Is it not true that the devil is always I looking after just this class for his own workshop? This precious company had moved out near the line of  Border's farm, and were living there on their own account,  among the wild-cats and hedge-hogs. Their character did i not improve when having only themselves and these wild  animals for company. They had seen the young settlers of either party going out to their new homes, and though they knew that Border's steady sons, in the home left behind, were starting many a new garden spot, without thinking there was need of thistles or running briers to ornament it, yet these wild and rough fellows laughed at such sensible notions. They saw a chance for wickedness, and swore among them- selves that there should be thorns and thistles growing all over the new farms. Surely they were possessed with something. And, fast as that company'of swine that Were possessed (as you read of in  the story,) ran down the steep hill, so those creatures rushed full drive over among the new farmers. Indeed, so rough and brutal were those men, that you could hardly have told them from the wild hedge-hogs that went trooping along beside them, differing from them in action so little. These rough-ones, (they deserve a worse name,) poured into the new farms at the moment when the most injury could be done. They kindled up the smouldering fires that might have gone out if let alone. They rushed madly back and forth over the land, shaking their knives at those who were   A STORY FORK FARMERS.       01 going about their business or looking after wives and little children. They worked upon the warm passions of those young Southern settlers, in order to stir them up to their own beastly rage; finally, they made those settlers swear, that any one on the new farms who said a word against thistle- farming, should never live in peace and quiet like other people. It was never known when they left the farms for their own regions, for they would come and go, again and again, like the rushing down of a herd of buffaloes-no, it was more like the fierce attacks of the boars or wild-hogs among whom they lived. Emigrant and his companions could do nothing against this cruel herd. They were too few and were living too far apart, and, though each had a hunting knife in his belt, they could do nothing single-handed against so many. Indeed, they were peaceable men and just wanted to be let alone. They had come out to live there, and knew it was not the rich home left behind, but that they must look after food for their little families. So they tried to gather in the grain, say nothing, and suffer for a time, hoping it was a storm which would pass away at length. But there was no mercy came from such ruffians as these I have described. At last they did nothing but live and prey upon the peaceful settlers; and swearing they would soon drive them out, they began to steal everything they could lay their hands on-the few precious keepsakes brought from the dear home in the East, and the corn and food for the family's support. They drove off the cattle; they burned up the hay- ricks. Yes, and they did not stop there. A company of them saw a poor fellow away from his home, and no one to help; they set upon him with their knives, cruelly gashing   32        THE NEW FARMS. him, and then they carried him home for his wife to see him die! When-once the wild beast has tasted blood, does he stop there? Poor Emigrant bled with the others. His house was in flames, his wife and children fled for safety. All over the land, one and another cold body lay here and there on the ground, with its dead face looking up toward heaven. It was on that ground which so lately man had taken, clean and unpolluted, from his Maker's hand. Did not a voice go up from the ground, and, joining com- pany with that silent look, make complaint against the crime  in the ear that is never shut? But did not the friends in the old homes hear of these things? Ah! Those who kept the borders took care against that. But the winds that blew from the West brought groan- ings; and sometimes, on a day of darkness and storm, the quick lightning would seem to show the picture of fire and blood to those watching friends upon the old home farms. Farmers, had you been there and seen the desolation and cruelty spreading over the land-had you seen those people who should have been brothers of one family, pursuing each other round with bloody knives, you must have said, with bitter meaning, that these thorns had pierced them through and through!  But I must hasten to tell of something else that was done, near this same time, in the old homestead, where was another meeting of the elder farmers, to talk over things. Though they had not been invited to say any thing about the one subject of their troubles, yet you may suppose they did not let it alone when such news was every day coming from the new farms, and each one knew that the matter was a serious   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        83 one. The talking was in earnest, then. I am not sure but there were some knives hidden on both sides. They were sitting round the dinner-table in the old mansion- house one day, when this matter had been warmly discussed, and then and there, Baystate could contain no longer. He stood up straight before them, and said it was a sin and a shame that fightings and robberies and murders should be going on in this way. He spoke of the news that had come to their ears, and then laid the blame just where it belonged. He also said that it would not have been so if Palmetto, like a crazy man, had not fancied himself some Knight of the Thistle, which was so pretty a flower he would have it himself, and every one else should have it and love it. Then he turned round and told Prairie that he started the whole mischief by his actions, and, in a most contemptible way, did nothing but follow Palmetto round, and whisper in his ear, "What pretty things your thistles are!" It would have made anybody feel two inches taller himself, to see the man stand up so bravely and tell his whole mind on the matter. But not so felt Palmetto. He was stung to rage because he was told the plain truth, but he was1 still more enraged because the truth had been told with so much courage; and knowing there was no knife to fear, he planned a cruel revenge. For two days, as Bay went out and came in, he watched his chance in vain. At length the farmers were separating after dinner to go to a funeral, but Bay sat a few moments longer at the table to finish a. book he was reading. Bent down low, he heard and saw nothing around. No friend of his was near to help him. At that moment Palmetto stole up one side, and, with a word and a blow, struck him senseless. Again and again he struck. Did he mean to take life? And there stood another by his side with   34         THE NEW FARMS. a knife in his hand. What did it mean? And others were looking on. Were not their hands bloody too? Some one came at last and stopped it. They carried him off as one dead, and long he seemed to be so. The first sound was like that of a wounded man groaning aloud, but bursting forth with the power and spirit of former years. "Not dead -do ye hear?"  The voice came as from a distant room, but all heard it; and at the sound, there was a light kindled up in some eyes that had never looked thus before. Did it mean they were awake then? These pages are red-Let us turn over the leaf. 'k ' .i'/   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        85 CHAPTER   III. "Is there nothing coming of all this but fightings? Does the story end so?" Well, there was a chance left, which I am to tell you of. As time moved on, the black storm appeared to pass over for awhile. There was no more fighting on the nejw farms. People who had been angry everywhere stopped a little to think, and, as the fires of passion burned down lower, the people grew more reasonable and more charitable again. Close in the old mansion had been living all this time, the old man so often mentioned. At the time to which our story has arrived, he had grown very old, and. the quarrels in his large family, that' family which commenced the world with such bright prospects, wore upon him, and he made up his mind to put an end to them. To be bure, he had allowed his children to have their way in everything, and while he pretended to be independent of them, yet he always did as they said. This ,time again, he determined to throw the care of the present, as of all future troubles wholly upon them, while still he seemed to keep his own power strong as ever.  So he told them he was tired of business, arid had also grown much too old for it; that some one of the farmers themselves, or one of their sons, could look after the general interests of the estate better than he, and therefore he wished to take a young partner, who would see to the whole of it, as   86         TIE NEW FARMS. he himself had always done; one who should stand in his place, and whose opinion all would regard, just as they had his own. In order that all might be satisfied with the man who would hold so important a post, he said they should choose him themselves, and then send him up to live in the old mansion-house. He also told them how wearied he was of the past quar- relling and endless talking at his own house, and he wanted a little rest from it. Of course, the farmers would continue to say what they pleased in their own homes, about farming gen- erally, or about the doings on the new farms. What had been done there, thus 'far, was only an experiment among those young farmers; though he confessed that the experi- ment was a serious one. But in this state of the affair, one thing was fortunate-he had not yet given out any deeds of the land: it belonged to himself, and the young settlers had no rights but such as should be given with the deeds, so that still there was a chance for his children to speak their minds, and help him make things better. He should therefore call upon them again to tell him what to do about these new farms. Of course, it was the same old question at the root of the evil. Would they tell him to enter a clause in the deeds that this thing should grow there, or should not grow there. But he begged of them to let their answer be a "Yes " or a "No." Nothing more was needed. This time, instead of the farmers coming up to his house to quarrel again, he wished them to do all the talking at their own homes. Not only the older farmers, but the children and grand-children, and great grand-children, all who were grown up to manhood, should have a voice in it. Let them get together in some place, and turn over the matter every way; study again the general principles of farming, under-   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        37 stand fully the nature of soils, and the suitableness of certain crops to certain lands, together with all the experience they could glean from their own practice and from foreign farmers; and specially he wanted the young men to try and remember what was the sober common sense of their fathers, the first settlers here long ago; what was the kind of farming they had liked best, and though the times were now changed, yet common sense was always the same, and right and wrong never changed, so that they must see their way clear in one course or the other to decide what kind of farms they wanted to make on all this fine new land that he was opening. He would tell them this, that it was good land; and they ought to make good farms of it. In fine, he told them to say all they had to say, and then let each man speak " yes" or " no," as he thought best. So the old gentleman finished his speech. And he fixed upon a day; it should be some time in the autumn of the year, when the busiest season would be over, and they could meet together, say their "yes" or " no," and choose the man. You see that this did not really differ much from the former ways of deciding their difficulties. And, considering what. a pitch the excitement of parties in this quarrel had reached, it was as sensible a course as could be found: first, because their affairs always had been settled in a similar way; but, specially, for the ieason that, where any people are thua bound together by interest, the greatest number ought to have their way; and more especially as the greatest number, when united with Uncle Sam, would make a very strong team. Most certainly if the quarrel about the new land could be settled in so peaceable a way as the firm saying of a " yes " or " n?," it was much better than that all these brotherly 4   38         THE NEW FARMS. families should get still more angry, fight and kill each other, as they did in that sad story of the last chapter. Farmers who are reading this story, you may suppose there had been talking enough about this whole thing, in the days and years that had gone by; but it was nothing to what was done now. The air was full of it; fuller than it is of snow in a winter's storm. The people read and talked, and rea- soned, and held meetings and handed about newspapers, and thoroughly turned the matter over and over and over again, till all the men, women, and children, knew the whole subject by heart. And what was it they said? Well, each one differed from another all over the land, but in addition to the reasonings of which I have told you before, the main differ- ences of opinion were expressed in this wise. The people to the southward said, "We don't care what is the best kind of farming. We know we have all kinds of crops on our land, and we consider them all just alike. Thistles are as good property as the rest. We have made it profitable. It is all good property. We shall take what we call property to the new farms, and you may take what you call property there." "ZBut it is not property," called out the Northern people in answer. "There is no common sense in saying it is prop- erty. Or if it is property, it is a peculiar kind which we should prefer you would keep to bless your own farms with. In the beginning we started to make the best kind of farms of any in the world, and it does not alter the fact if you don't care about it. There is only this question of plain common sense after all. Is it best to plant good new land with thistles? Any way, we never will as long as we live." And thus they talked, on one side and the other, just as they believed, but-the talkings ended at last, and each com- pany had named the man of their choice to do their business ' *'  i '   A STORY FOR FARMERS.        89 for them at the old homestead. Now it is not necessary to say who these different companies named, for I do not think the farmers cared so much who would be chosen, as that this one question should be answered plainly: WILL YOU HAVE THS ROOT PLANTED IN TIIOSE NEW FARMS? "Yes " Thus you now see, my good friends who are reading this story, that all these families are clearly divided on this same question, as they had been many times before in the old homestead. The only difference being, that this time the talking and acting was done at their own homes. And so the time came round, the great day on which each man was to say his " yes" or " no," and name the man he had chosen. You need not ask what the Southern farmers would say on that day, for they had settled that at once, and only waited to be counted all together. There were, here and there, some young farmers who would like to have said "no," but they were too few to be counted. Did the Northern farmers stand together like men this time? There were Granite, Baystate, and the settlers of that region, who, with their children, were neighbors to each other. Their farms were among the hills, many of them rough and stony, but these men thought they knew what good farming was, and their "no " was a loud one as they called it out that day. Next stood Empire, on his great and rich farm, with his great family of children and grand-children, to have their say in this matter. Years before, I remembered having seen the [fboys working away at digging up these roots from their gar- dens; and now there were gardens on that farm worth having. THE NEWBFERRY i I .. F 2y   Would any of those children like to go backward, and plant again roots like those they pulled up so eagerly? Was it likely then, they would plant just such roots in new farms? Close alongside this, and of equal size, lay Keystone's farm, and his family was a great one, too. Busy, they were, in every corner of it; and anybody would know they had been busy, to see their handywork. Sometimes, among the blue hills, and sometimes among the laurels or chestnuts, the young settler had built his house and his barn; a large barn,: too, such as other farmers could not show. And often had the young farmer, when under his broad-rimmed hat he worked in the burning sun, ceased his labor to receive from a stranger praises for the rich harvests that awaited him. And did he not deserve it? Of all the men on the North farm, Keystone and his family had worked the hardest to keep their land clean and clear. For many years, too, there were no voices louder against this evil that was growing on the other farms, than were some of Keystone's family. Not one year passed away, but some tongue was heard asking Uncle Sam to do whatever he could to prevent it. Long ago, before that Promise-line was made, Keystone and all his family together called loudly for having the new land clear forever. And was this the man, and this the family, to do the thing those Southern farmers wanted them to do? Beyond this farm, westward, was where Buckeye and a long line of other brothers had settled. These were the farms that had grown so fast, and these were the families that had grown faster still. It ,was a curious sight to look from the East out toward the West, from one farmer to another, and see how each one seemed to grow a little taller than his neighbor; so that, had you seen them in a line, they would have been like a row of children in a large family; only that, ,    in this case, the youngest children were the tallest. And they felt the tallest, too. They were shouting out, "We are great as any of you! See how fast we have grown! And we will beat you all soon, before you think of it!" Again they shouted, "Hear how we will call into Uncle Sam's ears,' No burrs on our new lands! We know better than that!" And their cheers, strong and hearty, came over the hills on that famous morning. That famous morning, it came at last, as each man on the large estate stood up to speak his word, and be counted for one side or the other. But there was another sight to be seen that day, could these busy men have lifted up their eyes for a moment. Across that wide river, to the eastward, were some high hills; and on the top of them, that morning, as the sun was coming up, stood a row of those foreign farmers, straining their eyes to see what these men were going to do. The stir and bustle on the great estate had reached their ears. They had been forever hearing these men talk of their fine lands, and their good farming. Now, they came to see what new thing was to be done. Farmers, you have heard my simple story through.
