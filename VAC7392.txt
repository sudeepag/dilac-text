"We go to rear a wall of men - On freedom's Southern line, And plant beside the cotton tree The rugged Northern pine." ARRAN  WATTS became a soldier in our second battle for liberty. He enlisted be- cause he loved his mother-land, and knew how she had prospered and why she had been assailed. He knew he should have no child's play as a private in  the ranks, but stern and bitter work; yet he was not afraid. No man ever went to war from the embrace of a happier home, or- a more endeared and loving circle of friends. From his cradle to his soldier's-cap he had been known by all these neighbors, and they all said, "Warran is a good boy; nobody ever heard harm of Warran"- His parents were people who read and thought much ; and they had brought up their only son to read and think. He had a good, firm foundation, and had   6        VICTORY. builded well his life thus far. He was just such a son as should make glad the parental heart, and he did make glad the hearts of his parents. Even when he came in with white and determined face, saying, "I have enlisted," they were glad, and proud of their boy. Their love for him took on a deeper meaning when they saw the stern pilgrim stock in such glorious flower under their roof. "Warran would fight well; he was born of warrior blood. Didn't his great grand- sire fight- the battles of the Revolution until he laid down his life for liberty I Ah, my boy, may these days be shorter and less bitter than those I But short or long, it is glorious to know that my boy is ready to die for his country." Warran knew his parents would sanction his enlist- ment; he was not disappointed in that. Mother and his three sisters worked busily for his comfort until the regiment left for the war-fields of the South. He went away cheerfully, as one may who goes on a providential mission, thinking, maybe, he should sleep in a trench with a hundred others, yet knowing -for he was a Christian hero- that the Father who num- bers our hairs, will not forget his children crowded in these thick-sown war-graves. His first sight of a battle was on that day which it gives us nightmare to think of; when we wonder the very sun did not refuse to shine, so dark were the issues of the fight. Over that black field his regi- ment swept "into the jaws of death, into the mouth of hell," and back, - but not the ten hundred. Warran was among the saved and unharmed. Through all the fearful carnage he seemed to be fear-   VICTORY.           7 less. The courage of superhuman strength seemed to hold him up and nerve his arm. Atnightfall, when the disorganized forces turned their faces backward, defeated, almost worn out, he straggled, like the rest, toward Washington. But he had spentall his strength in the fight; now that was over, he was weak as an infant. Unused to such exhaustive work, he had fought until his nervous power was all gone, and staggering away from  his fellows, who were only intent on self-preservation, he dropped down beside a fallen tree, and lay unconscious. The tramp of the mules, the screams and oaths of the drivers, the hurry of ambulance and caisson,-the dismal din of a disorganized retreat, were alike unheard. The morn- ing sun was high in the heavens ere he became conscious of surrounding lifB. Looking about himself and struggling dimly to recall the circumstances of his condition,  a party of Confederate horsemen descried him, and he was marched off,--a prisoner. Not long after, he was placed in a car  mostly filled with blue-jackets like himself. There Wlereone or two officers who seemed to be looking after the soldiers, and of one of these he inquired where they were going.  "To Richmond prison, you mudsill," said the man with brass on his coat. Well, this was not a desirable prospect, nevertheless Warran, by this time fully himself, was bound to make the best of it; so ihe looked out of the window and observed the country through which they passed, thinking over and over again the chances of escape from a   prison. Hie feared prison life would not strengthen his sinews, and had he been stronger he need not have been in this   8        VICTORY. deplorable condition. Camp-life, with its admirable ventilation, and the free use of army gymnastics would have made him strong; this he knew. Now he must pine in prison, deprived of the privilege of serv- ing his country for a long time to come, maybe forever. This was not quite like drilling by the side of Robert Bond, - who was dead now, dear fellow 1 - but he must take his chances, and this whole car-full were going to prison. How he longed for a familiar face as he peered among them, and yet, on second thought, he was glad his friends were not prisoners. Looking and thinking, and once singing, "M Iy country," he arrived at Richmond. The singing reached only the two words just recorded,when a Rebel sword threatened utter annihilation unless the music immediately ceased - in chivalric phrase, threatened to " cut his head off." The prospect of prison was better than being beheaded, so Warran meekly ceased singing, preferring living dog to dead lion. And they were marched through the streets of the city, and passed under the shadow of since execrable Libby. The accommodations then furnished our boys were somewhat -better than could afterwards be ob- tained at the same establishment. Neat live stock were plentier, and they had some beef with their bread and rice. And unclean beasts were not so numerous  I as to threaten our boys with a double imprisonment, like poor Gulliver in the land of Lilliput. Warran ate his ration and crept down in the corner, with a blanket between him and the floor, and went to sleep. He had not rested away the weary fight yet, and besides, sleep is oblivion and to one in trouble   VICTORY. or in prison, oblivion is biss. Next day he felt sick. There were leaping pulses in his. brain, and hot flash- ing fires along his blood. He tried to lift his head, but it would fall down again. The surgeon going through the prison, ordered him to the hospital. There he had something in the shape of a bed to lie upon, but he was soon oblivious to all surroundings in the delirium of fever. Daily he grew worse, and in his ravings called for his mother, until even the Rebel attendants were so softened that they obtained per- mission to get a female nurse for the fair boy, who they thought could live but a few days. So they sent word to the women who were caring for the Rebel sol- diers in the hospital, to exchange one of their number waiting by a malady less dangerous, for the convales- cent soldier who watched by Warran's unconscious pillow. A young girl hearing the request, said " she would go; that the men in her ward were not half sick ; she came to nurse sick men, and she wanted to do it, if she had to take a Yankee in hand." Warran knew nothing of the change.   The blue eyes which watched him were no better than the cross eyes of the soldier in whose stead she came. Bell Winton had come to the hospital because she was a thorough little Rebel, and bent on doing some- thing famous for the Confederacy. Her "papa" scolded furiously at her determination, but he could not stop her ; she had been too long suffered to have her own way. Her mother had been several years in heaven, and Bell had grown up as she willed, petted   10        VICTORY.  by " papa," and served by all the household of black people. It was a strange freak she took, of going into the hospital, but one which many of the once opulent  Southern women have since followed . She did not know much about sick folks, but she asked til doctor, and followed his directions to the letter.  At first she thought the sick Yankee would die, and  all she had to do was to make him comfortable as a possible until he went. But he lived on with wonder- ful tenacity, and she began to feel really interested in him, because he could endure so much. She listened to all his insane words, and learned much of his family history. She knew all their names. Sometimes he called other names--these she supposed were his friends. Fearing she might forget something he had said, she formed a habit of taking it down with a pencil. This served to occupy her time. One day when her patient had lain a long time in a heavy sleep, he suddenly opened his eyes and looked upon her.  , Who are you?" said he. "I am your nurse.  You have been very ill, and must not talk, but be quiet." ," Where am I?" it You are in a hospital."      angel, it You are not anybody I know; are you an angel, that you come to watch me when I am sick?" Bell liked being called an angel, and she thought her patient had fine eyes,and a musicaloice While she watched his face during these first conscious moments, she forgot all about 'Yankee" and "Rebel," and'thought only of standing by the bedside of a sick man. She brought him wine. te handed ithack, calling for water.   VICTORY. "Drink the wine, it will make you strong." "No, it will make me weak, I will not drink it. I have seen men so weak they -could not stand from drinking wine." She brought the water, and bade him rest now. This he tried to do, but somehow he felt that he was rested. He would close his eyes and try to sleep, but they would not stay closed. He had evidently slept enough, and as the disease was broken, nature would persist in trying her strength. He thought the girl who cared for him " a very handsome girl indeed," and wondered if she were a Rebel. He settled himself in the conviction that secretly she loved the'dear Union, or if she wanted to work in the hospital, she would watch Rebels instead of him. But he lay quiet, only thinking very fast, and asked no more questions that day. ,The next day her father came to see her. She took him to the cot of the sick Yankee, and introduced him. Then she told him how very sick her patient had been, and she had nearly cured him. Mr. Winton had been so provoked at his daughter for going into the hospital, that he had not before called upon her. His sense of the fitness of things was very much shocked as he watched Bell doing the work of a nurse amid such unhomelike surroundings. "You must go home, Bell, this is no fit place for one brought up as you have been A "Why papa, I like it. It is capital to do something yourself instead of always calling servants." "Yes, demean yourself with the work of niggers." "Why papa, I am not demeaned I I think I am an   12        VICTORY. inch or two taller than when I came here, - I know I am an inch or two taller in soul." "There are plenty of persons who are obliged to work, who can fill your place here; you are an only daughter,and I need you at home." "These women who are obliged to work have other things to do, and I have been dying these two years for some way to act out myself. I am really happy here I assure you." "Happy with your nursing and watching I I tell you, you must go home this very day." "Papa, have you lost your interest in the Confed- erate cause, that you refuse to let your daughter care for the sick soldiers? You have no son to give, and are too old to go to war yourself, you should surely be willing to let your daughter speak for your devo- tion to the South." "I let my daughter go to the hospital to take care of Confederate soldiers. I come here and find her giving her whole attention to a Yankee abolitionist, who has come down with Lincoln's horde to rob us of our rights and desecrate our homes." "Hold, sir" - said Warran. "I enlisted to defend human rights against the mad fury of the usurper. The battle I came to fight, is the eternal conflict be- tween human rights, ahd inhuman wrongs. Instead of robbing you of your rights, the Northern army would restore right to the blind and suffering people of the South." "Young man, if you are sick, hold your tongue. If you have only been playing sick to keep my daugh- ter waiting on you, woe betide you 1"   VICTORlY.         13 "Papa, don't talk so. You will undo all my good nursing. It is only two days since my patient could speak at all, except in delirium, and you must not worry him." "He is your patient no longer. Get your bonnet. My carriage is outside." "Really, I never like to give up anything I under- take. I have undertaken to get this soldier well, and I want to finish the work. He is not able to be removed yet, unless you bring an ambulance, and I am determined to see him well. If you won't let me stay here, why of course I shall take him home with me. "Of course you will do no such thing. Do you think I will harbor a Yankee abolitionist? If the whole Yankee nation were nowhere, our rights would be more secure." Warran would have spoken, but the man was angry and he knew it would be useless. Bell came and took her seat by his' side, and as she did so she remarked "why your hair has not been combed to-day,' and taking up the comb and brush, she began to smooth the chestnut locks of the sick prisoner. Her father was near bursting with rage at her cool and deter- mined air. Walking up to her, he said, "Do you intend to obey me? " On the conditions I mentioned," answered Bell. "Go, Miss Winton," said Warran, "the soldiers can watch me now, and may God bless you for your woman's care; it has saved my life." The soldiers cannot and shall not watch you, until you are much better. I shall watch yeu. Papa always 2   "        VICTORY. let me have my way, and he don't mean anything now, I guess. If he does, why we have a big house and plenty of servants, and he can say that you may come too. Then I will go home, - should like to go. I think I could cure you faster in our comfortable house." "Papa" not knowing what to do next, unless he carried Bell by main force down stairs and placed her in the carriage, and thinking such a spectacle would ill become his chivalric pretensions, stamped out of the room, muttering curses upon "Yankee abolition- ists." ' After he was gone Warran lay sometime with closed eyes, feeling that his position was somewhat delicate and a good deal embarrassing. The girl's grit suited him exactly. He liked her ideas of self-help. That was good Yankee doctrine. The nobility and inde- pendence of labor was a favorite topic with his father, and he understood very well the dividing line between North and South upon this subject. He wondered how Bell came by such a noble opinion, brought up, as her father had said, in the midst of servants, and a white race who look upon labor as degrading, and eat their bread by somebody else's sweat and toil, and not their own. By and by, when he had rested from the excitement of the morning, he opened his closed eyes, which Bell had been watching, fearing he was so overcome by her father's fury, he would have a relapse, and looking up said, "Miss Winton, are you a Rebel?" "Yes, Mr. Watts, I am." "Will you have the goodness to tell me why you   VICTORY.          15 are a Rebel? You have said some sensible things in my hearing, and I want your reasons on that point." "You must not talk now, it will hurt you. Wait until you are better, then I will tell you." "But when I am better you will not be here. Your father will certainly take you away. I saw the deter- mination in his eye when he left." "O, papa don't dare to; -he never crosses me." A shudder of bitter recollections crept over Bell as she said this. But still she thought she could evade that threatened cross. "Now, Miss Winton, if you please. I feel very well -am entirely able to listen, and perhaps occa- sionally I may speak." "Well, I'll tell you why the South rebelled, and then I shall give my personal reasons, for I think the South is right. The South rebelled because the Yankees were continually trampling on our rights.  We have borne it patiently until we could bear it no longer." "What rights, Miss Winton?" "Why, well, I suppose it means slavery. The Yankees were continually taunting us with our slav- ery, and calling us great sinners because we have negroes to do our work, instead of soiling our own fingers with it." "The Yankees, I know, love liberty and hate oppression. But you are to tell me why you are a Rebel. The Rebellion, you know, is against the Gov- ernment of the United States. What had the Govern- ment done?  "It wouldn't let us have our rights. I have heard   16        VICTORY. papa say that Mr. Lincoln, the new President, would liberate all our slaves. And papa ought to know; he has been in office." "Miss Winton, your father knows that Mr. Lincoln took the same oath that all our Presidents have taken, to support the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution leaves the States where slavery exists to regulate that matter. Mr. Lincoln could not have injured a hair of your slavery, and he would not." "Mr. Lincoln is an abolitionist, and our people did not vote for him." "Mr. Lincoln believes slavery to be wrong. He is pledged to its non-extension; that is, to keeping it out of. our virgin territory. That he would have done. Further than that he would not have meddled with it. Miss Winton, do you think slavery right?" "We have slavery here at the South, and we don't think anybody has any business to meddle with it." "But do you think it right to buy and sell human beings, as though they were cattle?" "Why, --when it comes to that,-no, I don't. When papa sold Bob, and he had just been married to Nance, I thought it awful. Bob was almost crazy when he went off, and Nance has never been good for anything since. She acts sullen, -mad-like, all the time. You may whip her and whip her, and she won't work a bit better for it. But then if they could always stay with the same master, and their families not have to be separated, it is not so bad. They are enough better off than the poor whites I see when I go to Aunt Mary's, down to Newherne." "That may be. But do you know slavery necessi-   VICTORY.         17 tates this class, so numerous in the South, called poor whites?" "No. How?" "The slave-master must have his large plantation. Year by year, through the sweat of the black man, he adds to his wealth and his acres. In a little while, from such a system, the land is monopolized by the few, and the less fortunate class sink into poverty with all that pride of race which they have learned while seeing the black man driven to his unpaid toil by the' white man's lash. They are too proud to work like a negro, so they vegetate; growing each year narrower and meaner, because all their manhood is dwarfed by inaction. That sense of feeling 'an inch or two taller' because of work, they know nothing of. To them work is despicable, because only negroes work, and they despise negroes." "Don't you have any poor whites at the North?" "We have no class answering to this at the South. We have poor men, but labor there is honorable, so our people toil, though many of them, through miscal- culation, sickness, or having large and dependent families, remain poor. The slave system has cursed and blighted the South. It makes the master usurp. ing and unfeeling. It blinds him to his best interest, his best good. I can- tell you why the South re- belled." "But you are talking too much; you will certainly get sick." "No, I am strong when thoughts of my beloved country stir my soul. The South rebelled not because her rights had been invaded; they had not been. The   5   *   18        VICTORY. Government had surrounded slavery with guarantee after guarantee. The first time I went to Boston, what did I see? One picture is printed on my brain. . I saw a black man marched through the streets, on either side of him soldiers of the Government, sending. hirm back to slavery, when he had been brave enough to get away. The Government kept giving and giving of her free soil to slavery. Nearly all our Presidents and Cabinet Councillors have been in its interest. The slave-power, by this monopoly and continual rule, had grown fat and defiant. They saw in the North a growing sentiment of freedom. They feared the time would come when they could no longer rule the nation, so they made Mr. Lincoln's election a pretext for their long-nursed purpose to ripen in rebellion. The leaders of this movement have inflamed the ignorant people by their lies, and so you are all rushing to destruction. They have rebelled in the interest of slavery, and to strengthen this wrong, which is what they mean when they talk about their ' rights.' I am not a prophet, but I venture to predict that this move- ment will be the death of slavery in this country." The flushed cheek and flashing eye of the sick sol- dier told of his hearty wedlock to his country's cause. To Miss Winton they told, too, of weakness, and she commanded him to be silent and rest, or she would call the doctor. "To-morrow," she said, " is my birthday. I shall be eighteen, and I am so glad, for I am to have some- thing my mother left for me to open on that day. You must get real smart so I can run home after it."   VICTORY.          19 From a long and refreshing sleep. Warran awoke feeling quite strong. - He sat up a little while, and afterwards reminded Miss Wlinton that it was her birthday, and she must go out for the contemplated walk; asking her how far it was to her father's and how long she would probably be gone. "O, it is a mile or two," said she, " and I am not going just yet, either. You see papa does not go out until ten, and I have no notion of encountering him. He might take it in his head to lock me in." Warran had thought that very thing, and did not feel at all sure Bell would return, even should she wait until after ten. But Bell was not afraid. She knew her father would wend his way to the Capitol to hear the hot words of the Davis Congress, if he was able to get there ; and if he was not able to walk he would ride, -it was his habit. He had followed the spirit of the hour, and was one of the maddest Rebels in Richmond.  He knew, to be sure, that it was his daughter's birthday, but he would not remember it in the midst of present exciting scenes. About the box, she was not sure he knew anything. Her mother left it in the% care of an old and faithful house-servant mother of the sullen Nance ; from her Bell had learned of the little trust. She remembered her mother, to be sure; she was ten years old when she died. She remembered to have seen her often weep, and there was a settled sadness on her countenance. She stood in awe of her for this, and had not learned her mother- heart as she might, had not her own buoyant nature sought gay and joyous companionship. In little services for Warran, the morning passed   20     .   .-.V ICTORY. away, and the hour arrived when she thought it safe to take a peep at her own home. She tripped lightly through the streets, all of them familiar, when she had escaped the vicinity of the prison. Her long and close confinement in the hospital made her enjoy the free air and sunshine as she had never done before, and she thought the city more beautiful, and the blue heavens lovelier than they had ever looked- even in the days before the war. Bell was really an inch or two taller in soul. Arrived at home, she ran up the steps and tried the door. It was locked. She preferred not to ring, feeling a little afraid she might waken the echo of her father's ire. Possibly he had not gone out,-she would be cautious. So she opened the side gate and ran through the garden to the back of the house. Nance was hanging clothes to dry;- -this was oppor- tune. "Nance, is father in the house?" t Yes, and a lot ob big men wid him. They are talkin' bery loud, I hear 'em when I go under de "Are they in the drawing-room, *or library? "In de library." "Then I am safe!  "What you mean?  iss Be no t 'frai of her father?"  "Nance, I am nursing a Yankee soldier, who says the war is going to free all your people. Yesterday father came, and said I must go home, and Mr. Watts -that's the soldier-says he will surely come and bring me, he is so mad because I am nursing a Yankee.   VICTORY.         21 Now Naace run and bring me the little box --this is my birthday - ask mamma for it - she will know." Nance ran into the house and presently appeared in company with her' mother, who brought the mysterious box and delivered it to Bell with much ceremony, ending her dissertation on the sacredness of her trust with the fervent wish that "Miss Bell would be the good woman her dear mother was."  Somehow the old African seemed impressed that the box contained some revelation from Bell's mother -which would have something to do in shaping her life. Bell clasped the box as one may who gains a long- coveted treasure, and, after thanking "I mamma ' for her faithful ti ust, turned to go - but stopping suddenly she said, "Nance, does Dick know the way to Libby?" "Guess he does. Not much in this old town Dick don't know. He is round the house like days, but he does a sight ob 'splorin' nights. Dick am white folks den." "Will you send him to the prison hospital, with a basket of good things for the sick? You will know what to put in --*chickens and jellies and fruit - and, Nance, will you keep your ears open and learn what papa talks about, and come round by and by and tell me? Remember I'm nursing a Yankee, who says the war will liberate all your people." Nance had quick ears, and had heard before what the Yankees thought of slavery. She wished the war would liberate Bob in the rice swamps of Louisiana. As for herself, no matter She hated life, anyway, with her white and black blood at boiling heat. One   22        V1 CT OR1Y. part of her might be somebody, if it was not for the other. But half was nigger, and who cares for a nigger! She knew how she had been cared for. She knew the brutal ways of the chivalric race - didn't she hate them I Hadn't they broken every tie that had any strength or life to it? sold Bob the very first year of her marriage. Bob was a better man than his master, she knew that. Could not she show scars because she too was better than her master? Well no matter for her! Bell arrived in safety, and found the young man with the chestnut curls sitting up in bed and looking very glad. She too was glad that her mission had been accomplished without interruption, and though she hardly knew why, she was glad to sit down again near the Yankee soldier. She saw plainly that she could not be nurse to him much longer. She was both glad and sorry for this. After a little care for Warran, she withdrew to the window, and proceeded to open her bequest. A little key unlocked the box, and, was she disappointed? We shall see. There were no pearls or diamonds for a birthday gift, but the box contained several pages of manuscript in a fair, legible hand, - she had seen the hand before, - it was her mother's. Bell began to read, and while she read, Warran watched the currents of feeling as they played over her face.   * '                       .   r CHAPTER   - II. "The crisis presses on us, face to face with us it stands, With solemn lips of question, like the Sphinx in Egypt's sands." IS birthday gift of Bell's, as it is neither pearls nor diamonds, but something which should work a more wondrous transformation than outward adornments could ever do, it will be neces- sary for us to describe. And lest we do injustice to the noble woman whose heart dictated the bequest, we will let her speak on the printed page as she spoke in the manuscript her daughter so intently reads. "MY BELOVED CHILD: "Feeling that I shall never see the maturing woman- hood, whose early promise my heart has yearned over so anxiously, and desiring to reveal myself to you as I cannot now, I write these words; trusting to your good sense and woman's nature for the influence of what I say. "You know your mother was a Northern woman; farther than this you know little. Your extreme   b: youth would make it impossible for me to reveal my  inner life,--my thoughts and sentiments. You will (23)   24        V C T OI Y . read this on the day you are eighteen, and I trust you will then have ripened to a full understand- ing of my life, which you doubtless remember as sin- gularly sad and lonely for one in the high circle where I might have moved. "When your father, educating himself at College in my native city, first singled me out among the young ladies of our circle as the object of his especial attention, I was full of wild delight. My ideas of Southern life were like those we form of primeval Eden; luxury, and beauty, and repose. My father had helped to create this unreal picture, by frequent delineations of a condition of society where our drudgery should be performed by servants, and where we could spend life in elegant leisure. To him the South was a paradise; its mines of wealth as thick as grass-blades; its inhabitants happy as angels. My father loved ease, he was born so, - a sluggish nature,. without those finer chords which ring at the sound of the hammer or the whir of the loom, feeling God's handwriting upon the soul in this dominion over the elements. I remember my mother sometimes said, ' there's another side to the picture, Albert.' But she said it quietly, and my father's word sounded like law. I believed my father. All the welcome he could show the Southern student was heartily extended, and I accepted every attention'eagerly, feeling myself highly favored among women. "The day I was eighteen we were married, and left New England immediately. Our home was a large plantation on the James, the hereditary birthright of your father, as he was the only son. At first, how-   VICTORY.          25 ever, he was not master; This father had that position, but I had to take the place of mistress, for Mrs. Winton was dead. I felt very much exalted by my situation, and began to assume its responsibilities with a good deal of arrogance. I think I was not unkind to the house-servants, but I know now I was very imperious. I did not soil my own fingers even .with personal care, and if I saw a speck of dust on the piano, I ordered it removed. At home I had swept and dusted the parlors, but I would do it no more. The slaves were made for work. I was made- to sit a queen and know no sorrow. "Your father, left without any special care or call- ing, not even the oversight of the estate, became entangled in political affairs which kept him much from home, and which I could not then understand. tHis interest in politics became widely known, and he went to the legislature as young as the law would allow. Sometimes I accompanied him to Richmond, and went about to balls and receptions,--for the Capital was then very gay. I enjoyed these seasons, but the tinsel was wearing off, -I had not found the expected paradise. "From one of these winter revels we returned to see that: the hand of disease had surely touched our father. He had not complained, but the change in his looks was so great we were struck with terror. He continued to falter, and died in the early summer. This was the year before you wgre born. Now your father was sole proprietor of the estate, and I hoped he would be more at home, and I should thus feel happier--more at rest about him. Some of his asso- 3O   26        VICTORY. ciates in Richmond were repulsive to me, and I was glad of the prospect1of staying quietly on our planta- tion. I had no defined fear, only a little dread that he might be led astray. "My husband never talked much with me about his business, but one day he said the plantation must be sold. I was terrified, and inquired if he did not like this kind of life. He said he did not like it; he pre- ferred a city. But there were worse things in the way than like or dislike; there were debts which could not be liquidated otherwise. "' Can't you sell some of the servants? ' I ventured to ask, knowing they did such things sometimes when in debt. 'It will take all of them,' he replied, ' and then how can the plantation be managed?' "This I could not see, but I was still puzzled about the debts. I had heard father Winton say the planta- tion made something each year, - how had the debts come? I was a wife, so I asked. "' We have been living in Richmond these five years,' he answered, ' and it is high life there.' "'But, my dear, if we cannot live in Richmond winters with the help of the plantation, how shall we live without it? ' ' I shall know better how; and when the debts are paid we can start comfortably there. I shall be nearer my friends and the Capital, and you know I am re-elected and must take my seat. The plantation must be sold, there is no escape from that, and to save any further ifs about it, I will tell you that the bargain is nearly consummated now. All that makes me hes-   VICTORY.          27 itate, Littell don't want all the slaves; he has nearly enough to stock the place without them. But pur- chasers of such a big place as this are not thick as grasshoppers, and I must not let my man slip. I can sell the niggers fast enough.' "' But you wont want to divide them. He might select part of the members of a family, and that would be too bad. The rest might be sold down South.' "'It wont do to be squeamish in this matter, madam. Iie wants his pick of the niggers, end the rest will be knocked off at auction; that is, the field hands; we will take our house-servants to Rich- mond.' "At the close of this announcement a stranger was ushered in; it was Mr. Littell. I left the library. The bargain was consummated. Littell was to have his choice of the negroes, and would take half the field hands. I was full of trouble now. Though I had never cultivated much acquaintance with our black people, I felt an interest in them which was dif- ferent from my interest in the horses and mules. Whie'n Jack, who had taught me to ride horseback, came with tears and terror on his face, saying, 'Missus, I'se not picked, I'se got to go down Souf,'-- I think my emotions were different from any I should have felt had my pony been the one to be sold. 'Jack,' said I, 'you shall not be sold,' you shall go with us to Richmond, and be our coachman. I will ask Mr. Winton, this minute.' ".The fellow looked grateful, and I ran to my hus- band, nothing doubting but my request would be granted. But I was mistaken. He said Bob must   28        VICTORY. be both butler and coachman,--we must. retrench. I told Jack, trying to get his sympathy for us, that we were not able to keep him, but he had none to spare. He sat moodily down on the horse-block by the door. "I' Jack, is Huldah picked? ' "' No, missus. P'se not picked fust, then Hul- dah she steps lame like, and I declare to de littel man, she hurt herself bad, so she wont be good for nuffin any more. I tink mebbe wese get togedder if she act up smart when de sell comes.' "' O Jack this is too bad I ' I said, and then I ran to my chamber. I thought and thought, trying to hit upon some plan to save the separation of. our people, but my hands were tied. "We moved immediately to Richmond, so as to be near when the auction came. After Mr. Winton had gone to the sale, I was so troubled, so full of unrest at this thing which was being done for money, so sorry for my favorite Jack, that I could not stay at home, so I put on my bonnet and went to the auc- tion. Mr. Winton saw me, and thought I had brought him some message. When I told him I had come en- tirely out of interest in our people, he said I had better go home, as women who had husbands to trans- act business for them were not needed at auctions. I heard him, but another sound just then smote my ear. "' Just agoing, a likely negro - five feet ten--not a day over twenty-five years - sound and strong - a magnificent coachman.' "I looked, it was Jack. The bids ran fast and   VICTORY.          29 29 high, and then ceased. He was knocked off to a cotton planter from the Sea Islands. * "Mr. Winton desired to keep the families as much as possible together, so Huldah was put up next. She had got over her lameness and ' showed smart.' But the cotton planter did not want her. A neighbor of ours, on the James, thought she was well built and would 'raise capital stock for the market,' so he bought her at a high price. O my child! The terror on those two faces! It haunts me yet. Jack cast an appealing look at me. I went to the man who had bought Huldah, and asked him if he would not buy Jack too -  thinking the cotton planter would sell at a premium.  I told him what a good horseman he was, and that he was Huldah's husband. "' No,' said the man. ' I raise stock for the market, and have niggers enough.' I offered to help pay for him, thinking if I sold my jewels they would come to part of his value--though I had comparatively few jewels. But there was no help. ' He was able to buy his own niggers, and he knew the sort he wanted.' "Meanwhile the sale went on, and it seemed to me had the object been to separate families, it could not have been more completely done. Only in one instance did husband and wife go together, and their children -  five in number - were all scattered. "But, my child, I must not dwell upon this terri- ble scene. Even now it brings a pain to my heart as keen as I felt then, when my awakened conscience first stood face to face with this crying sin. From that time I was no longer indifferent to this Southern Institution. I studied it in all its windings, and found 3*   30        VICTORY. only evil in the system. The fact that it helped a few to live in self-indulgence did not palliate the crime. That very self-indulgence was their ruin. All tho finer elements of their humanity were dying out. They were growing imperious - inhuman - losing every- thing noble, and gaining nothing but paltry gold, and the power to rule still more and more. "From the time of the slave auction, my troubles began. I could not feel such a great awakening, without revealing my sentiments to your father. He was angry at me for my weakness, as he called it, and expressed himself very severely that he had an abolitionist for a wife. My reasoning with him was of no avail, so I gradually relapsed into silence on the subject, trusting time and some providential touch to open his sealed eyes--for he was my husband, and I could not bear to have him live his life and die with- out learning a lesson of human brotherhood. I dared not open my heart to any of my associates, and I think I should have died years ago if a word in my brother Henry's letters had not given me a confiden- tial friend. Henry had grown strong in soul, and he told me many things of his own travail and deliver- ance. He told me too how thought at the North was ripening, and occasionally sent me papers. These I got when Bob went to the office; if your father went, he thought best I should not see them. "So I passed my years, - thinking of the terrible evils of slavery - and no hand to mend the matter 1 I was sad at heart ;- the affairs of my own home not helping to brighten my sky, for your father was haughty and cold, and spent nearly all his time in political work of some sort.   I.    VICTORY.          31 "Your birth and early years were a bright spot to me, but even in thought of my child I could not be wholly glad. I knew I was not strong enough to buffet these waves long, and your father, to whom you seemed most naturally to cling, would bring you up to think his thoughts, and be the helpless, careless woman whose type I saw jn the representative class about me. "I have begged of him to send you North to be educated, but this he utterly refuses to do, declaring he will not have two abolitionists under his roof. He seems to take it for granted that a Northern education would make an abolitionist of you. It took a South- ern education to make an abolitionist of your mother. I had to stand face to face with slavery, before I saw its hideous deformity. "I will not detail further to you my unhappy life, -but I trust the revelation of my sufferings in conse- quence of adherence to right principles will not dis- courage the attempt on your part to investigate for yourself this momentous subject. Plant yourself upon the rock of truth now while you are young, and never, let me beseech you, give your hand in marriage to an owner of slaves." Bell sat with bowed head for sometime after reading hier mother's letter. Thought was doing its work. The face of Nance at the door roused her, and she gradually recalled the circumstances by which she was surrounded.   C-HAPTE     - "I. "God's balance, watched by angels, is hung across the skies. Shall Justice, Truth, and Freedom turn the poised and trembling scale I Or shall the evil triumph, and robber wrong prevail?" MISS BELL,'" said Nance, "I hear sumfin'. I creeped round and curled up in de bushes, under de window. Massa talk so loud! O Miss Bell. Him comin' dis bery night. And Massa Madbry-- him dere too. Him eat dinner long o' massa." "Madbury I " exclaimed Bell, in white terror. "Yes, Massa Madbry, him say Miss Bell must marry him now, and dat will keep her from de 'Yankee.' Massa Winton --him say so too. Dat am de plan, him say. And den dey talk 'bout comin' wid de car- riage ten clock - I hear straight - ten-a-clock." "O Nance! What shall I do to escape this man? I hate him, and father knows it. What shall I do?" "Now, Miss Bell, dere am jes one way. Dick am 'bout as big as you, and him's got new clothes. Massa neber seed 'em. You slip round home to-night, and put 'em on; den go to your Aunt Mary's. Don't stop wid any white folks on de way, and don't be in a hurry 'bout gettin' dere." (32)   VICTORY.          33 "I will do it," said Bell; her whole face lighted by the deterrmined spirit which stirred her. MaIdbury was a rich slave-dealer. He had long been engaged in buying human bodies and souls from the Virginia raisers, and selling them down South. He had grown plethoric in body and purse on this distinguished business; and because of his gain, he thought himself a great man. He had attended so many slave-auctions, and examined the points of human cattle so often; that he thoroughly understood his trade, and could not be overreached by any of his illustrious fellows. He carried this prying, inquisitive air into his intercourse with white people. The first time he ever saw Bell MWinton was in her father's  house, where he had gone to talk over some matters of business. Bell recoiled from his gaze as though he had been a rattlesnake. Unfortunately Mr. Winton was heavily indebted to this man, and consequently very gracious to him. Whenever he called, Bell was summoned to play or sing for his entertainment. She obeyed her father, and tried to forget, in the waves of melody, that she had any other listener than, her own rapt self. The result of all this exhibition of fine points was, that Madbury asked Mr. Winton for his daughter's hand, and received immediate consent. Whether the fact of his indebtedness influenced Mr. Winton, or whether he was dazzled by the suitor's great wealth, or a little of both, cannot be fairly stated. It was a good many years since he was married, and if he remem- bered that he married for love, he remembered also that his wife turned abolitionist, and he would guard   34        VICTORY. his. daughter against such a disgrace as that. To be sure, there must be some twenty years' difference in their ages, but that was of little consequence when weighed against the safety of his daughter, and the security to her of an affluent home. One day Madbury apprised Miss Winton that her father had given her to him, and asked her to name the day for their marriage. Bell showed her fire. "I will not marry you, sir. My father has no business to dispose of me; I am not a slave." Mr. Madbury was thunderstruck. He thought he had only to reach out his hand and take this bright young girl as easily as he passed over his money for Phillis or Ned, whose fine points he had examined. What now? Well, this chivalrous gentleman proceeded to inform Miss Winton that her father was in his power, and he could ruin him, and he would, if she refused to be his wife. "Ruin him if you want to," said Bell. "You are not going to ruin me, just remember that, if you please, sir." She said it between clenched teeth, and not knowing what ruining her father meant, or she might have been outwardly more gracious, though 'as unyielding in soul as before. -Madbury rung the bell. Mr. Winton was informed of his daughter's obstinacy. Miss Winton was dis- missed from the room, and the two men talked the matter over. "Can't you manage the affair, Madbury? Women   *            - -'VICCTORY,         35 are often obstinate at first, just to get more entire homage. They want a good deal of courting. I don't know what I can do about it. The fact is, Bell has come up pretty much as she pleased. I have always let her have her own way, and if I should lay any commands upon her now, she would think they were nothing, coming from her indulgent old father. I think you can manage it. Don't be in too much hurry, and I promise you my daughter will not long remain blind to the advantages of such a union." "I have always made the world come to my time, and I don't like giving up to a woman now. Besides, I am going to New Orleans with a large lot of niggers, and I would like to have our business settled first; then I thought to take your daughter with me and let her see something of the world." "It has come rather sudden upon Bell. Suppose you let the matter drop until after your return? Meanwhile' I will talk with her, and show her the superior advantages of marrying a man who is estab- lished in business, and has stability of character. You may feel quite easy on one point. Bell has no lover. Her answer to you was not framed because of pre-engaged affections. I will keep her out of society as much as possible in your absence, and see that she forms no attachments. How long will you be in New Orleans?" "My   business there grows upon my hands; and this time, owing to the condition of the country, I may be obliged to stay six months. You know I can afford to let my agent look after the'purchases a little now; but I like to watch the sales myself. A nigger will show his points better if his owner is round."    36        VICTORY. After much more similar talk, Madbury, not very graciously, however, promised to wait. He bade Mr. Winton "good day," and went to his hotel, secretly revolving several little plans for capturing Bell and taking her with him. But he reflected that it might not be so pleasant to have her company after all, if she went as a captive. If she kept up the show of grit which had so astonished him, it would not be pleasant, certainly. A good deal of his anticipated joy had rested in showing her fine points to his friends in New Orleans, and if she pouted and would not show off, why, all of that would be spoiled. It would not do to give hera few cuts as he did the " niggers " when they were sullen on the auction-block. That would hardly be chivalrous. And so, after a heavy dinner, and several bottles of champagne, he turned his thoughts to less perplexing subjects. Mr. Winton did not like to tell Bell the extent of his moneyed indebtedness to this man, nor how it had come about, so the argument of " ruin to father " was not urged in the great plea which he made for the "rich and chivalrous"Madbury. He told her how much he was supposed to be worth, and how success- ful he was in business, and what a reputation he had for shrewdness, and that he was older than she, so that she could feel to rely upon him. She need not fear failure in wealth, or instability of attachment, which there would be danger of in a younger man.- He told her that Mr. M. had gone to New Orleans, and when he returned, would expect her favorable answer. Bell heard him through, and said, "When he comes back I will answer him." And here the matter rested.   VICTORY.          37 Madbury had returned for his answer. In the con- ference which Nance had overheard, the whole affair 'had been planned. Bell was to be taken that very night, willing or not, and married immediately. Her father's ire was roused now, and he determined to take his daughter away from 'abolition influence. He was stirred to the point of opposition to her will, now  that it came in conflict with the corner-stone of " our institutions, sir!" 'I No knowing what might be the effect of hospital life with that Yankee. Maybe Bell was .already infected with abolitionism. Madbury wo4uld cure her of that if shea was. He hates the whole Yankee nation, as intensely as I do, -as in- tensely as I do," said Mr. Winton, with a significant gesture. Mr. Winton was an easy bark on the current of secession. There was nothing in his nature to resist its fury. He drifted like the rest, stirring the waters occasionally with hot words and the point of his cane. It was his habit, to use his walking-stick by way of emphasis. Mr. Winton walked the house in impatience for ten o'clock to arrive. It came at length, and seated in his close carriage with Madbury, he started for the hospital. Dick was on the box and drove through nearly all the principal streets of Richmond. lMr. Winton became conscious of riding a long distance, and putting his head outside, called out, "Where are you going to, Dick? Don't you know the way to the hospital?  "Yes, massa. I know de way. Ise been makin' de hosses go fur'ous, cos I knows massa wants to get Miss Bell home agin. We'se most dere, massa," 4 '  *'"                       *    38        VICTO  Y. and, with a flourish of the whip, Dick turned into the dirty street and soon stopped. The gentlemen alighted and went immediately to the little room occupied by the sick Yankee - a sort of separate cell -I suppose to keep him apart from the chivalry. Mr. Winton walked directly to Warran's bed and inquired for his daughter. "She went home about an hour ago, I should think. She told me she was hasty in her answers to you, and must make amends to her good father by going home." Mr. Winton was delighted. "I thought my Bell would come to her senses," he exclaimed, as he turned in haste to leave. Madbury, not so credulous as the old father, thought it best to have some other than Yankee testimony in regard to Bell's whereabouts, and asked the surgeon. "Miss Winton told me her father wanted her to come home. Of course I gave immediate consent. I think the hospital no fit place for a lady like Miss Winton." Then Dick flourished his whip again, and the car- riage went whirling away. The gentlemen were so delighted to find what they expected to be a trouble- some piece of business suddenly vanished from con- templation and participation, that they talked inces- santly of the prospects of the' Confederacy, which were " fair as the morning," and laid plans for action when the South should become independent. Dick understood their mood, and thought it a nice time to have a good ride about the city; so he drove as far as he dared to and stop just inside of sus- picion, and then wheeled up to Massa Winton's door.   E:!j            VICTORY,          39 The gentlemen took seats in the parlor, and called a servant. Mamma came at the call. They had evidently begun to think of something besides the Confederacy.; "Tell my daughter to come into the parlor." "What massa mean? Poor old mamma han't got loud 'nough voice to reach clear away to de hospital." "The hospital! We've just been to the hospital, and the surgeon told us Bell had come home." "O laws a massa! O laws I My poor Bell. Sumfin' has happened to her! I 'spect de Yankees' has cap- tured her!,' "The Yankees, you fool. There are no Yankees in the city except those under lock and key. Are you sure Bell did not come in unobserved and go to her own room? She is doubtless tired, and may have gone to bed." "Miss Bell neber would come in dis house widout speakin' to her old mamma, she ain't seen dese tree, four weeks," "Go to her room  and see." Mamma   went and returned with the information that Bell was not in her room. Mr. Winton was alarmed.  He was not so sure his daughter could come safely from that locality at night; Richmond had changed.   There were rough soldiers about their once quiet city. He sent Madbury to summon aid from the authorities, while he called the house-servants and engaged them in the search. The thought struck him that, possibly, Bell might have heard of Madbury's return, and slipped away to the house of some friend to avoid seeing him. He ' .   40        VICTORY. questioned the servants closely as to whether any of them had been to the hospital that day. All denied ever having been there, except Nance, whom mamma was in the habit of sending with clean clothes for Bell. Nance averred that she had her basket all packed and was going in the morning, sure, and now "poor Bell, mebbe she never'd wear any more pretty clothes." The servants seemed in great distress, and flew about in all manner of aimless ways. Mr. Winton felt convinced that they knew nothing about his daughter. If she had heard of Madbury's return, it must have been through some friend in a merely incidental way, while she was coming home. He did not think it was known that he was Bell's suitor. He was filled with terror. His only daughter was miss- ing -maybe abducted - maybe killed. The authorities prosecuted the search. Her friends' houses were visited, and then by-ways and places of danger - every nook or hiding place where a human being might be hid away. The ticket agent thought a young lady answering the description of Miss Winton had taken the Southern train the night previous. Mr. Winton caught at this, and proceeded at once to Newherne, thinking perhaps his daughter had slipped away to her Aunt's. His reproaching con- science secretly whispered that Madbury was the cause of this disappearance, and behind Madbury, her own father. But he did not find her; neither did the authorities find her; and Mr. Winton felt a heaviness about his heart which had never been there before.   V ICTORY.          41 As for Madbury, he vowed between clenched teeth that the girl should not escape him if she were on the face of the earth. Just then he was obliged to look after his " niggers " with both eyes to keep them from all becoming contraband. 'When they were safe, the girl should be found. Poor Madbury was passing through trying experi- ences. The times had become perilous to owners of slaves. They could hear the voice of liberty calling them from afar to break these fictitious bonds and reach after their birthright. And many of them answered the call with fleet steps. So poor Madbury had his hands full, with the rest.   A= CHAPTER IV. "O weary hours I O night of years I What storms our darkling pathway swept, Where, beating back our thronging fears, By faith alone our march we kept." HERE is Bell? When her father started to the hospital after her, she saw from the window of her own room, the familiar carriage whirl away. She stood there full of thought, not knowing when she should see again the father who had been so indulgent, or the home where she had been so comfortably cared for. But she pre- ferred death to marriage with such a man as Madbury, and she would "escape him, or die in the attempt." She had left the hospital with a very brief good by to her Yankee patient, not daring to trust herself with lingering words. After she was gone, Warrai remem- bered she had said," I hope you will get well," with an emphasis which still thrilled his pulses. This he intended to do speedily, now his bright and pleasant nurse was gone ; and then he longed for a place in the ranks once more, but alas I when would that privilege come to him, a poor captive I Bell was thoroughly disguised by Dick's new suit, and the shining negro mask with its crisp hair which Nance had furnished from her treasure-house. (42)   VECTORY.          43 "Now, Miss Bell, do you mind the way we went for berries last summer, arid the hut where I talked with the woman?" "O yes, I remember the way. And surely I shall never forget the face of the woman who gave us drink. I thought her uncommon handsome, for a negro.'- "She's got a handsome soul, Miss Bell. You go straight there, tell her all, and she'll help you. Now go, and de Lord bress ye," added Nance, a blessing which mamma repeated, and she was gone. Nance could speak English as well as her mistress, but she generally checked herself when she found she was talking well. She was a slave, and she would use the slave's dialect, keeping the pure tongue for liberty, which glimmered like a star in the distance, and neared and brightened when she remembered what the Yankee captive said the war would do for her race, Bell found no difficulty in tracing the berry path- to the hut of old Dinah. Once outside the city, she tripped along fearlessly enough, not once thinking of fatigue.. 'She passed through the meadow where she had gathered delicious strawherries, in the sweet summer days, before her head or heart had been stirred by the alarm of war, or the struggling cries of an enslaved race. She did not think of those days regretfully. True, it was pleasant to lie in the arms of a summer peace, but is our life lent us only to waste in idle, sensuous dreams? A few weeks of toil in the hospital had been sufficient to convince Bell Winton, that a diviner joy is born of self-endeavor '   "       VICTORY. than the soft-handed dreamer can ever know. She felt strong in soul, and ready to face life's wintry weather, now that its winds howled and its blasts beat against her defenceless head. She would be firm and true to a noble mother's counsel; true to a tdivine purpose which she felt fullgrown in her own heart. No slave-master should call her wife. More than that, she would work for this stricken people. What might not have been her fate but for their fidelity? She had a personal debt to cancel. And O, the sor- rows which had -come to them through the blindness of her own father. She recalled her mother's picture of the auction; she remembered with added grief the separation of Bob and Nance. Then, these instances were but as a drop in the bucket, when the wide land entered her thoughts, with its four millions of men and women, kept and used as cattle. "I can help them," she said, with emphasis, " and I will." Pompey and Dinah, sleeping profoundly after a hard day's work, did not hear the gentle rap on the door of their hut. It had to be repeated until the delicate knuckles ached, before Bell succeeded in rousing the honest old pair. "Who dar? 1" said a voice from within, while fingers were heard untying the latch. As soon as Pompey saw the shining black face, he readily comprehended the situation, and with his strong arm pulled our heroine within the half-open door, and instantly fas- tened it again.- It was not the first time " runaway niggers ' had come to him for shelter. He under- stood the matter perfectly. Only yesterday he had sent two splendid young darkies toward the North Star.   VICTORY.          45 "Now," said he, "young man, you go to bed and sleep, ancd to-morrow we'll talk and lay plans." "If you please," said Bell, in her natural voice, for she was unaccustomed to acting a part, "I would like to see Dinah, and tell her everything." Dinah lifted her head from her shelter -of bed- clothes, at this appeal, and rubbing her eyes and looking at the figure, exclaimed- "I knows dat voice, sure! ' But I knows nuffin tall 'bout dat face. De voice and de face don't belong togedder, nohow." "Whose voice is it?" said Bell. "Why, Miss Bell Winton's. Should know it any- whar arter I'd heern it once." Bell approached the bedside, and instantly removing the mask, inquired whose face it was. "Well, now," said Dinah, ' what's de mischief, dat Bell Winton come here dis ere way?" Bell proceeded to tell the whole story. When she called the name of Madbury, these black people shud- dered. Bell supposed they detested him because he was a disagreeable man. She afterwards learned shey had deeper cause than any disgust his personal pres- ence could inspire. After Bell had ended her recital of personal fears and sorrows, and heard the joint promise of Pompey and Dinah, to ' help her hide from Madbury," she was pointed to a bunk in the same room, and soon the light was out, and silence came with the darkness. She was very tired, and felt entirely safe in this negro hut, so she soon fell asleep. It was very late next morning when she awoke. Pompey and Dinah   "       VICTORY. had gone on tiptoe, for fear of breaking her needed repose. After breakfast she still complained of feeling tired. "Why, Miss Bell, one night of sleep ought to rest you from dat small walk," said Dinah. "I have been at work in the hospital, and that may be the cause of my excessive fatigue." Then she told them of the Yankee soldier whom she had nursed through a fearful fever, not forgetting\ to add his prophecy that the war would free all their people. "De Lord grant," said poor old Dinah. "May it free ebry one, and den Sam will be free." "Who is Sam?" inquired Bell. "He is our son," said Pompey. "But you are free, so Nance told me; how came your son to be a slave?" "Ah, de Lord hab put us in de same furnace, Miss Bell," said Dinah. 1"De same finger am stirrin' de fire. May de Lord hab mercy on dat bad Madbury." "AMadbury!" exclaimed Bell, " tell me about it. Did he enslave your boy?" "It's a sad story, and Miss Bell is tired and in trouble ; don't make her feel any worse, Dinah." This Pompey said, thinking it would add to Bell's distress to hear evil of the man her father had been willing to make her husband; not that he thought she would feel especially interested in the fate of their son. He knew Mr. Winton, and knowing that the father upheld these atrocities, he had nothing to hope from the daughter. He knew,.to be sure, that it was whis- pered from one to another of the black people, that Bell's mother was very kind to her slaves, -that she   Ad-.      VICTORY.         47 was a Northern -woman, and prayed for the time to come when they might all be free. -But she had been dead many years, and could not have influenced her child, -who was too young to understand when she left her. Bell told these people that her own trouble made her the interested friend of all who suffered, and desired them to tell her of Sam, and, said she, "who knows but I can help you?" Dinah saw consent in Pompey's eye, and began. "It am two years and more since our poor boy was missin'. You see he was tall and strong, most twenty years old. He hab two fine horses and go teamin' round de city, but ebry night he stay in dis hut wid de ole folks., One night he say: { To-morrow I go for Massa Madbury clear away to Petersburg. He hab ten likely niggers takin' down Souf.' "I didn't want Sam to go wid de niggers, but he say Massa Madbury give him twenty dollars, and that's twice more'n he could make, and Sam was layin' up money. He loved Celia, Massa Goff's chambermaid, and Celia am a slave., He keep all de money and hide it away to buy Celia. So I thought of Celia and de money, and say nuffin more about de unrespectable business of carryin' off niggers. Next day Sam got up real early, and de horses was prancin' wid life, and Sam neber look finer. -He went off wid a flourish, and me and Pompey say, ' Sam is just as good as white folks.' Jack Goff say he take in Massa Madbury, and den dey go off gedderin' up de niggers. Some ob em didn't ride far wid our Sam cos dey live most down to Petersburg. Well, de night come, and   48        VICTORY. no Sam; den we's tink mebbe de niggers made 'trouble, so it will take to-morrow, too. And to-mor- row night come, and no Sam come flourishin' up de lane. Den we's fear trouble. Pompey and me set up all night watchin', and startin' at ebry little noise, tinkin' mebbe Sam come. Den Pompey go up to Richmond, and nobody'd seen Sam come back. Celia she groan and cry, and say Madbury be a bad man." Here a flood of bitter memories quite overcame the old African, and she ceased the narration. From broken sentences afterwards uttered between her sobs, Bell gathered the truth. This man Madbury had long coveted the athletic Sam. He would bring a round price in New Orleans. It was of no consequence to him that Sam was free. He thought a " nigger " had no business to be free. And it annoyed him to make bargains with a black teamster; he wanted the power to command, when a black freeman came in his way. He watchedahis opportunity, and under the pretence of hiring Sam to take a load of slaves to Petersburg, he consummated his infamous design. When a few miles out of Richmond, a white man hailed the team- ster, and asked to ride. Sam answered that his team had a full load engaged, and he could not accommo- date him. Madbury then interposed, saying that as most of the niggers were at a station almost down to Petersburg, he guessed they had better let the gentle- man ride; whereupon he climbed into the wagon. They had driven until Sam thought they could not be far from their place of destination, when, on near- ing a piece of woods, Madbury very coolly presented a pistol, and told Sam he was his slave; while the   - VI CTO 1 Y .         49 white accomplice handcuffed and bound him almost instantly. Then the chivalrous ]Madbury directed his course to the railroad station, where he had other slaves confined, and added Sam to the little army of victims, all of whom, though they knew the ring of the driver's lash in Virginia, were in utmostCterror at the prospect of life on a Louisiana plantation. Sam was dumb. He was helpless. - But when his captor stepped away to further arrangements for their depar- ture, he managed to arrest the attention of a black woman who sold fruit at the station, to whom he told his tale, and by whom it was telegraphed from one to another until it reached the despairing ears of Pompey and Dinah. When Sam engaged to accompany this man, he was told that the negroes were to be gathered up from the different plantations where he had purchased them. On no other pretext would the engagement of a team- ster have been reasonable. And when- Madbury spoke of the station-house, he thought he must have sent his  agent to collect them to save trouble. Sam was hurried off to New Orleans, and where he toiled, and what he suffered, his parents knew not. When Bell Winton took in the enormity of this piece of business, she felt strong enough to shake the pillars of the whole Institution. And she was flying from this thief who had dared to ask her to be his wife. She wished she had wings. She would balance them above Madbury's head, and haunt him with the raven's croak and the eagle's scream, until he revealed the place where Sam might be found. Ah, the eagle is screaming now in your ears, O stealer of human S1        I,   50        VICTORY. souls, and you are summoned to give account of the men and women who live a daily death at your hands. Your ears shall hear that scream forever, unless you deliver up the keys of the house of bondage 1 Bell expressed her sympathy, with all the enthu- siasm of a fresh young spirit, and told the old people of her mother's counsel, and the glorious light- which had come, like the morning, to her understanding. "I never gave slavery a thought before," said Bell. "Can anybody think of its enormities and not detest the system?" ( "O, yes," said Pompey; " they can think, but they cannot think rightly, without detesting the inhuman monster. The white man has two ways of thinking upon this matter. One way he thinks down into his pocket, and says, ' It is right because it lets me live easy and have plenty of cash.' The other way, he thinks into his heart, and says, ' God made the black man as well as me, and I have no more right to buy and sell him than he has to buy and sell me."' Pompey was a noble specimen of his race. He had been freed in early life by a humane master, who had also taught him to read and write, and given him many of his books. He was a great reader, and thought it as easy to talk like a book as to use the broken dialect of the poor whites. He wanted Dinah to speak cor- rectly, but she thought her cronies would think her "stuck up because she was free," so she kept her humility undoubted, by talking like her slave sisters. With her great reverence for Pompey, I think she rather liked to present this striking contrast, that his superiority might be apparent to everybody.   VICTO  Y.        51 "I shall help your people, - the way will open, I know it will; meanwhile let us lay plans. I must not tarry here within hearing of the bells of home. How shall I get to Aunt Mary's? Nance thinks I had better go to her; but she is my father's sister, and will she be truer to me than to him?" "If Nance said go, you are safe with her. It does not take a slave long to find out a friend. Your aunt has been much in your house, of course, and these slaves have found out whether she can be trusted." "But, Pompey, how can she think differently from my father? She is his sister, and has always lived at the South." "She will tell you, no doubt, the travail and deliv- erance of her soul, when she finds you are ready to listen. There are many ways of opening the eyes of the blind. Jesus sometimes anointed them with clay, and,then bid the blind go wash it off, and straightway he came seeing. The clay itself would make the best eyes blind until it was washed away. So, sometimes-the Lord suffers his children to get earthly riches, then he sweeps them away utterly, when they engross the mind and blind the soul to its true and only lasting riches. , There is gain in loss." "Yes; if I lose my pleasant home and my indul- gent father's care, it is not all loss, for I am so strong in heart. This has all come to me within a few days. I did not know what it was to feel that I had the powet to do and suffer until I went into the hospital. I can walk all the way to Aunt Mary's, and I must start." "No, Miss Winton, not by day. Many slaves are 1'!  '  '       ' '   52        VICTO RY. seeking the Union lines, and there is the utmost vig- ilance on the part of the masters. You would be in danger of capture in your present disguise, and it will not be safe to drop it until away from this vicinity." It was arranged that at nightfall Pompey should harness his horse, and taking Bell in the disguise of a black woman, go to the house of a free negro by the name of Peter West, who lived some ten miles away, and whom Pompey and Dinah were in the habit of visiting. So with Dinah's Sunday suit, and gay colors, Bell took her seat in the little box-wagon by Pompey's side, and they started. They had not gone far before they were accosted by some one who knew the team, with, "Halloo, Pom- pey! takin' a ride?" "Yes, Dinah and I thought we would pay a visit to our friend West, and to save the heat we have started by star4ight." "Did ye hear old Winton's lost his daughter?' said the voice. "The old scamp has tried every decent way to find her, and now he is going to try bloodhounds. Madbury furnishes the hounds; I heard this at the city where I have been all day." W CVhen will the hounds set out?" asked Pompey. "Why, as soon as Madbury can bring them in from their present chase.; they are off after contrabands, now " Bell kept her seat with difficulty while this piece of news was being reeled off. As soon as they had distanced their informant, she inquired who he was. "A fathomless white man. You hear how he talks   VI CT OR Y.        53 to me, but to a slave-master he uses a different tone entirely. He is all things to all men; but I suspect when the trial comes, he will be on the right side if he can get there." "But do you believe my father will do this thing?" "At the instigation of Madbury he may do anything. There is, doubtless, suspicion that you have sought friends among our people, and that is the way we are hunted.' Pompey hurried his horse, which could show con- siderable spirit-if necessary, and the ten miles were gone over by half past nine. He introduced his charge to old Pete with much ceremony, and won the sympathies of the family at once. They promised to help Bell away from slave-masters and bloodhounds, if it were a possible thing. Then Pompey hastened home. It occurred to him that he had been a little unwise in telling where he was going, and if the hounds should come in his absence, it would at once fasten suspicion upon him as an accomplice in Miss Winton's escape. While he was hurrying with all speed towards home, he saw two horsemen coming down a cross-road, and there were hounds with them. They came dashing up to Pompey and demanded his name and business, - " a nigger out at that time of -night.,' "O laws, massa, Ise bin to mill, hab to work so hard days, can't go to mill cept nights." "You'd better stay at home nights, you old fool- don't you know the niggers are all running away, and *   54        VICTORY, we catch every one we find. Nothing would save your old neck if you were going the other way." Pompey was glad the moon shone dimly then --for he was not known by the villains - one of whom was Madbury. "I They will rest to-night " thought he, " and to-mor- row they will set the hounds." Pompey was soon at home and in bed, but he did not sleep much. He was troubled for the safety of Miss Winton, but glad she was even ten miles away from there. He did not care for his own safety, -" life was of little worth to an old man like him." Before they were up in the morning, there was a furious barking about their hut. Springing out of bed immediately, Pompey was dressed before the riders had overtaken the hounds. He answered their assault upon the door by opening it and appearing before them. "What do you want of an old black man so early in the morning?" said he. "We want you to produce Miss Bell Winton, in- stantly," answered Madbury. "Miss Bell Winton does not lodge in a hut," said Pompey. "Go to the city, and to the house of her father, for her." "You must be an old dummy if you have not heard of her escape from her father's. Every nigger knows it in twenty miles of here, and mark, old man, the hounds have traced her here; beware of your lies." "If you doubt my word," said Pompey, " walk in and examine-the premises." ' The two slave-hunters walked in. Everything was overturned and examined which the simple hut con-   VICTORY.          55 tained. Even a basket of cabbages was tipped over in their hunt for Bell. White with rage, and muttering curses, they de- manded where she had been hidden I "Gentlemen," said Pompey, " do you trust the nose of a dog sooner than the tongue of a man? I tell you no white woman has ever lodged in my hut." "Dare you say no white woman ever entered your hut?" cried Madbury. "No, I will not say that. Neighbor Willis comes here often." "Dare you say Bell Winton never came here." Dinah spoke up. "O massa de ole man nebber see Bell Winton, nebber. I seen her once when I carried out drink to Nance, who was pickin' berries in de meadow dar. Just once I seen her, and Pomp, he no- where round.' "Has any stranger been in your hut within the past twenty-four, or thirty-six hours?" "Night before last a black boy came to my door." "What did he want, you scoundrel." "He wanted liberty, and before this I think he has found it." These men were baffled. Withdrawing to a safe distance they consulted upon the probability of Bell's assuming a disguise. The hounds had tracked her here; these people said no white woman had been here, but a black boy had come to the door. The more they thought about the matter the more sure they felt that Bell had assumed disguise, and probably that of a black boy. As these astute gentlemen revolved the subject, it became quite apparent that Bell Winton   56        VICTORY. could not have left the city in her own dress without being seeni; she was a lady of large acquaintance. After settling this matter to their satisfaction, they returned, and asked Pompey what the boy said. "He inquired the nearest way to reach the King- man road." "You said he wanted liberty, how did you know that?" "I surmised it by the course he was taking." Madbury tried to set his hounds, but they only snuffed the ground and returned to the hut, as though there their search ended. "How is this, old man? You say the boy went on, but my hounds refuse to stir a step from here. There is no track from your door." "I think the boy must have ridden; I remember to have heard the sound of wheels after he turned away." Here was a dilemma. Bell Winton had been traced to that spot and had gone on; who had helped her? Utterly baffled they returned to the city to report to Mr. Winton. Bell was so troubled about the hounds that she could not sleep. Every noise that wakened the echoes of the night, was interpreted as Madbury's horse- hoofs mingled with the bark of his dogs. In the morning she consulted with her new friends about her best means of safety. They assured her that she could not be tracked farther than Pompey's- that the hounds could not follow her a step farther than she had walked. But all their assurances did not allay the sense of fear which haunted her. She did not feel safe, and begged them to take her away in some dis.   V ICTORY.         57 guise or other, which would insure their safety, and promise any hope of success. Old Pete's stalwart son, Harry, volunteered the un- dertaking. "I knows de underground railroad, missus. We'se got one in ole Virginny I reckon, good as any up Norf. Didn't I take Bill and Josh troo safe I Dere clar to de Union lines fore dis." "But I want to go to Newherne." "Yese better go to de Union lines, missus." "Who will take care of me in the Union lines? They are all strangers, Harry." "Dere's de berry place where dey does take care, I reckon;--jis you wear dat are woolly head, and de Yankees look out for you, sure." "I can go from Fort Monroe to Newherne, can't I? But how shall- I get there?" "Take de underground railroad, missus, I knows de way.  "Then let us go," said Bell. "I am not safe here, I feel it. They will surely track me to this place." Harry disappeared for a few minutes, and when he returned, there was a neat-built horse standing out- side, attached to an odd-looking light wagon. "D'ye see dis here, missus? Well dis am a ridin' habit, new style, jes come ober. Good many nig- gers has worn dis yere, but Miss Bell's a nigger now, sure. Jes you step into dis handsome habit, and wese proceed on de journey." Bell almost recoiled at the thought of seeking safe- ty in a bag; but remembering Madbury and the hounds, she said: "Any way, Harry, any way; only insure me safety from present perils."   58        VICTORY. "I 'sure ye safety, missus, jump in." Bell had sent back Dinah's Sunday suit, and was dressed in Dick's new clothes, and the shining black mask. She pulled on the long coarse bag, which came far enough above her head to tie. When she had got into it, these helpful black hands packed it with cotton so as to hide the outlines of her form, and graduating it from the shoulders to the chin, the bag would never have been suspected to contain a human being. Before tying it, Harry said, "Now I 'spect dis'll be jes a little warm, but yees must bear it --no oder way. Ebery nigger what's got a massa am watched pretty close dese times, and some what aint." Bell thought she could bear the warmth better than the ride in the position she would be obliged to assume, to accommodate her new character. But the whole family went out to arrange the hay in the bottom of the wagon, and see that the head of the bag was highest, and between them Bell stood a good chance of being laid down as easy as possible. And then they started. It was no laggard pace, Harry's nag kept up for the next two hours, and then they halted in a piece of woods, full twenty miles from the home of Peter West. Harry proceeded to untie the bag and release Bell, whom he expected to find about dead, notwithstanding the brave replies which had come from the small end of the bundle when he had asked every fifteen minutes, how missus "i was stoodin' it." At first she could not stand, but said she felt better than she expected to. Harry poured water on her   VICGTOR Y.       v59 V I C T O V, Y; head, and then she walked a little way, but soon staggered to a fallen tree and sat down. This pace would never do. Somebody might drive off his horse if he was gone so long, so taking Bell in his arms as though she had been a child, he darted through the woods like an antelope. When they had passed over two miles of- distance, they came to the opening of a large plantation. "Now, Miss Bell, creep a little?" Ill try," said Bell-but she could not go far. She was evidently exhausted. Taking her under the shadow of a tree, Harry crept to the huts of the plan- tation slaves, and told her story, returning with refreshments, which he thought would help restore her. Then telling her to lie still there in the shade until night, w hen the slaves would come after her, he crept back into the woods and hurried swiftly home. Bell thought she would creep to the huts as soon as she felt strong enough, but her strength did not come, and at night she was borne to the negroes' humble shelter by strong black arms.   --- CHAPTER          - V. "Alms, alms, for our hunters I why will ye delay, When their pride and their glory are melting away?" l  ?HE story of the hounds spread like wildfire through Richmond, and I am happy to say there were some who condemned such a means of hunting for a white girl. But Madbury's disappointment at her loss was urged by the multitude as sufficient reason for the justification of any course on his part. As for Mr. Winton, let it be fairly stated that he was entirely ignorant of this scheme on the part of his proposed son-in-law, not having returned from Newherne. When he heard of it .next day, I do not think he smiled any less patronizingly on 3fadbury, after the shudder and scowl of the sudden thought had passed away. Much depended on finding his daughter, and whether he thought the end justified the means, or feared to oppose the hound-setter, is not quite easy to make out. Mr. Winton was nottransparent. He had lived long enough among masquerades to learn a little of the dissembler's art. When Madbury and his agent related, with many curses, the history of their chase, and it flew from lip to lip that Bell Winton had been tracked to Pompey's hut, one, who listened with open-eyed wonder to the tale, thought there was a chance to turn a penny. (60)   'VICTOnY.         61 This was none other than the man who accosted Pompey on the way to Peter West's and told him of the dogs. Now Phil Hardy was an anomalous character. He was Union and Secesh, a friend to the slave, and a friend to his master, just according to the company he happened to be in; one of those mean whites who are so common in the vicinity of Southern cities, and- make such excellent tools for the slave-hunter. Nobody ever knew how Phil got his living, for he was never seen to work, and 'owned neither slaves, horses, nor land. But he did live, and looked like a man who never missed his rations of bread and meat, nor his whiskey. Of course there was a large reward offered " for any information concerning Miss Bell Winton, daughter of Hon. Westgate Winton, who was in the deepest grief at her mysterious disappear- ance," &c. When Phil Hardy had become master of all the facts in the case concerning the presence of Pompey and Dinah in their own home the very morning after he had seen them going to Peter West's ten miles away, he went at once to call upon Mr. Winton. At the mere hint that he bore information of his daughter, Mr. Winton's face brightened, and he be- came very gracious towards this fellow, whom he despised as heartily as he did- a " nigger I' "Tell me what you have learned, Mr. Hardy," said Winton. Hardy proceeded- "Night afore last when I was goin' home, I saw Pompey and Dinah in his wagon, and he said he was goin' to his friend Peter West's,. ten miles- away, to 6   62        VICTORY. make a visit. And I understand, sir, that both Pompey and Dinah Vining was found in their own establish- ment next mornin', at five o'clock." "What has that to do with my daughter?" de- manded Winton. "Well, I think it looks like foul play in the old   nigger, if he told me he was goin' ten miles off to   make a visit and was home next mornin'. And it      struck me then that the woman was not so big as Dinah -but 'twas Dinah's clothes. She didn't say    nothin' neither, and Dinah Vining can't hold her tongue if anybody's round she knows." "Pompey denied   knowing anything about my daughter, and I have always heard him called an honest nigger." "Never a nigger lived yet that wouldn't lie, and if he didn't tell a whopper, then I'm mistaken." "Hie may have changed his mind, you know, and returned without going to West's. "That's unreasonable. And I think when a fellow gives you such information as I have, you'd better use it, and I've no objections to seein' ye fork over." "If your information leads to the discovery of my daughter I shall certainly pay you the reward, Mr. Hardy. Are you willing to take oath of what you have said?" "Yes. Swear to it on as many bibles as you can lay between here and the Union lines." Madbury was immediately sent for and this precious piece of information communicated to him. He clutched his fingers, as though Bell or her father's money was already within his grasp. All that Hardy   VICTORY.         63 had said was taken down and duly subscribed to, and taking an officer with him Madbury rode in great haste to Pompey's hut. He walked in without cere- mony, as though he had a right to this nigger and his acre of land. Pompey was in his garden, and had been hidden from their approach by the shadow of his hut. Dinah immediately called him. He came in, and with courteous obeisance to Madbury and the officer, waited, hat in hand, for them to make known their business. Madbury spoke - "Phil Hardy says he met you night before last in your wagon with Dinah, and you said you were going - to Peter West's, ten miles off, and that the woman did not look large enough for Dinah; and it is pretty plain to us, you old scamp, that you were carrying off Miss Winton, disguised in Dinah's clothes. How is it that you were back here next morning, if you were going a visiting ten miles off?" Pompey, nowise daunted, deliberately replied- "Phil Hardy did see me night before last in my wagon with my wife. We started to go to our friend's on a visit, and were deterred from going by some- thing he himself said." "What did he say to stop a nigger from indulging his laziness, I should like to know." "He said Madbury was scouring the country with his hounds, and we-- thought we would return home, knowing the man who stole and sold our son was not to be trusted if a free negro came in his way, when he had hounds to help him." Madbury darted at Pompey with the fury of a tiger. Pompey stepped aside, and he struck the door-post.   "       VICTORY. Then he flt for his pistols, but he had left them in his room, not thinking he should need-them in just going to Mr. Winton's. The officer interfered and advised him to keep calm. Madbury was too angry to know what he did. To have an " old nigger " accuse him of stealing his son, in the presence of an officer of the law, he couldn't brook it, and he wouldn't. He went out of the house, threatening vengeance upon its in- mates. The officer told him not to disturb Pompey. He was an honest man, and evidently knew nothing of Bell Winton. "And as he has you at a disadvantage, you had better let him alone. If he should make the matter public to which he alluded to-day, it might injure your reputation among some of our people." Madbury chafed like a lion, but he could pot help himself, so he returned to the city, " foiled again by a nigger." It was a matter of much -wonder where Bell had obtained her disguise, if she had one, and they felt sure she had. Dick's wardrobe was overhauled, but nothing was missing, and the servants seemed so overwhelmed with grief at her loss that Mr. Winton believed they were quite innocent of any complicity. If the Yankee soldier had been well instead of sick, he would certainly have been accused of jugglery in the matter; but a man unable to get out of bed could not have assisted in his daughter's escape. She must have had some unknown friend, so Mr. Winton thought, and the more he thought the more he was puzzled. He tried to forget his undutiful child in his zeal for the Confederate cause; but, somehow, her   VICTORY.          65 face, pale and thin, would look up to him from the pages of the Examiner, no matter how interesting the war news. THe saw it, too, on the walls of the room, where he went daily to hear the hot words of the Davis Congress. It haunted his dreams, and startled him into watchfulness night after night. There was reproach in it, always, and a voice seemed to utter from the ghostly lips, a sentence of condemnation upon him; her father. Then he would try to shake off the accuser by recalling his indulgent care all her life long. There was a quiver of the nerves when he thought of promising her to Madbury, but he checked it instantly, and began to count Madbury's money, and estimate his slaves. And so the days went by. To Bell, languishing with fever in a slave-hut on the banks of the James, there was neither day nor night. Sleep had-forsaken her eyes and slumber her eyelids. In her delirium she besought her attendants to keep her from Madbury, - to kill the hounds, - not to tell her father where she was; and sometimes she told them they did not half take care of the Yankee sol- dier, --that she must go to the hospital again herself or he would die. It was a bitter experience to those slaves, who had borne her tenderly to their hut, to see this fair girl suffer so deeply in mind as well as body. They pitied her, and helped her as they could. When she came to them, she said, "I fear I am going to be sick, --I feel very strangely; but do not tell my father, unless I die. Then you may send for him to a bury me." Next morning she was delirious, and the old black woman who stayed with her was glad she had said 6*   "       VICTORY. this while she had her senses. Now she should know what to do. All the little remedies which her experi- ence had gathered, were faithfully used for Bell. A physician could not be sent for without revealing their sacred trust. So these black people, one and all, remembered the magnitude of their charge, and watched each symptom of the fever, trying all in their power to allay its ravages. But it was fierce and ter- rible, and they feared the poor child would die. Day after day she grew worse, and there seemed to be no hope. "If she could only sleep," said old Phillis, " she would be better right off." But she could not sleep. If she fell into a drowse, she started immediately, with some terrific cry of Madbury or the hounds. Bell had passed a terrible night. The crisis of the fever was near. She had raved more incessantly than before, and had not even lost herself in sleep. The women were consulting about sending for Mr. Winton. They thought there was no chance for her to get well, They talked in low tones in her room. All at once she sprang out of bed and darted towards them, saying she would kill them if they sent for her father. Then she fell on the floor in a swoon. The women were frightened, and let her lie several minutes on the floor, thinking her dead. Then they lifted her in their arms and carried her back to bed. They discovered that she breathed, and knowing that cold water was used for persons in a faint or swoon, they drenched Bell most thoroughly in it.- Then they thought she would take cold, and so they piled on the bed-clothes.   VICTORY.          67 Phillis sat down to watch. She breathed regularly and slept, - the first good, refreshing sleep for weeks. This was encouraging, if only she had strength enough to bear it. But she was not wakened; these people have faith in nature. After several hours of profoundest and sweetest sleep, Bell awoke, and they could see that the fever was broken. She had sweat copiously, and from that time she began to mend. But it was slow work. Her body and mind had been severely tortured, and it took a long time to restore her. The mellow autumn days gave place to crisp and frosty winter before Bell Winton was able to make further progress toward the Union lines. Meanwhile she was not unhappy in a negro hut during the protracted days of her convalescence. t                         CHAPTER VI. "He rose, a man who laid him down a slave, Shook from his locks the ashes fo the grave, And outward trod Into the glorious liberty of God.' ARRAN WATTS seemed to have suffered a ^  y O relapse. The surgeon thought him much worse the day after Bell left him, and feared he should have this Yankee on his hands for some time to come. Sep- tember was nearly gone and he could not walk yet; "evidently a weak man," said the surgeon, " nothing to build upon; or else he pines for his mother. Pity such a'baby ever went to war if that is really the trouble." Going into Warran's room one day, he said, "Young man, your nurse says you take your rations regularly, why don't you get strong? Are you pining after that girl, I should like to know I If you are, it might be of interest to you to know that she has not been seen since she left the hospital, and the probabilities are she is murdered, or worse; has gone to herd with the niggers. Her lover, Madbury, set his hounds on her track, which they, followed to old Pompey's hut about two miles out of town, and that's the very last trace of her. She can't come back to nurse you any more, so you'd better get well without her. Indeed, sir, if you don't show your metal before long, I shall think you are shamming, and turn you out of-this." { (68)   VICTORY.          69 Warran disclaimed any pining for the girl; "he cared nothing for the girl; he had been very sick, and supposed it would take a long time to get well." The surgeon thought it had taken a long time. The night following, the hospital lights burned low, and many of the nurses slept. The one who watched Warran said his patients all slept, and " he'd be plagued if he was going to lie awake counting their snores," so he laid aside his 'outer garments, pulled off his boots, and, wrapping himself in his blanket, curled up on the floor. Warran slept very soundly until his watcher began toe show signs of rapid progress towards the land of dreams; then he crept out of bed, and arrayed himself in sleepy Reb's cast-off clothes. He crowned his head with a cap bearing the initials of a Virginia regiment. Then tak- ing the boots in his hand, he took up his line of march towards the open air, which he thought would greatly accelerate his convalescence. If any one saw him, they thought it was one of the watchers, and said nothing. At the bottom of the stairs he pulled on the boots, and turning into the passage soon found his way out of this stived and pestilent place. The air did invigorate him greatly. He soon found himself marching at double quick, with head erect as soldierly as the best F. F. V. in the State. Two or three butternuts accosted him, and inquired if he was " the- bearer of despatches," or if he had just "three minutes and no more to get to camp-?"But his head was clear in this bracing September air, and his Yankee wit was sufficient for any question a half-drunken soldier would be likely to ask.   70        V IC TORY. He followed the course of the James, and walked until his strength began to give out, and the morning light admonished him to seek a hiding-place. He saw a negro driving some cows, and asked him if his master was at home. "No; massa gone to war. Him 'fraid de Yankees swaller ole Virginny whole, so him lef dis here chile to look arter de niggers and de cattle, and him slope." "Are there no white men about the plantation?" "Ise de whitest, massa." "Are there any white women?" "Missus she gone to Richmond and take de chillen wid her. 'Spect she's 'fraid de Yankee gunboats '! be puffin' up here some dark night." "What would you do if you saw a Yankee gun- boat, Sambo?" "My name am Jupiter, massa, if you please." "Well, Jupiter, what would you do if a Yankee gunboat lay anchored off in the James, yonder?" "Golly I guess dare'd be some tall runnin' 'bout dis ole plantation." "Which way, Jupiter?" "Why dat all 'pends on circumstances. If dey should fire, de balls would come here sure, and in dat case Jupiter would try his best to get out o' range." "But, massa, s'pose dis nigger turns de tables and ask you a question." "Ask anything you please, Jupiter." "Are you a deserter, massa?" "No, not exactly. But I have travelled most all night and am tired and hungry; can you give me breakfast, and a little chance to rest, Jupiter?"   VICTORY.          71 "De 'federacy 'll kill a poor nigger if he harbor deserters." "The Confederacy will hardly find it out while you shelter me, and if it does I'll take your part. A few hours rest and I must be on my way." "Massa shall hab sumfin' to pertect de inner man, sure. Nobody eber go hungry from de hut ob a slave, (when massa am gone.") "Where is your master stationed?" "He am at Yorktown. Dis present minute I 'spect he am wid missus. Yesterday-he come stavin' up on his smart nag, and put on his shinin' new soger clothes, I tell ye, he looked fine - and he say to me, ' Jupiter I am going to Richmond, on business, and to see my family; you must keep a sharp look-out over my horse, and feed him up well while I am gone - I'll be back in three days at most.' So Ise feed him up well." Warran followed the slave to his hut and lay down to rest while his coffee and hoe cake were being pre- pared. He immediately fell asleep, and Jupiter said "Iet him sleep, 'twill do him more good dan breakfus." So Warran slept until ten o'clock; then eating heartily of the simple fare spread before him, and drinking almost intemperately of the strong coffee, he went out to find Jupiter. He felt quite sure from the roll of his eyes when talking about the Yankee gunboats, that Jupiter could be trusted; at any rate he would try the magic of "Liberty and the Union lines" upon him, and watch its effect. "Many slaves are seeking the Union lines and lib- erty, Jupiter; I should think you would try to escape, you have such a fine chance in the absence of all your master's household."   72        VIC TORY. "Dat am pretty talk for a Secesh soger. Dat's jes de way de Yankees talk." "Did you ever see a Yankee, Jupiter?" "No massa, I's nebber seed none, but I's heern tell." "Jupiter, I am a Yankee. I escaped from the hos- pital last night, by putting on these clothes which my nurse had laid aside while he slept. I want to get to the Union lines. Will you help me?" "O laws! O gollyI O goodness gracious! I tink you's jes a little pale for Secesh. O, de Lord am come, sure!" and Jupiter went through several glee- ful antics which could not well be described. "Will you help me, Jupiter?" "I reckon dis chile will help a Yankee. Eber since Jupiter knee high, he hear old granny tell 'bout de Yankees and freedom. An' when de big guns begin to go off, we's t'ink liberty comin' now, sure, - de Yankees bringin' it in dere gunboats." "I have a plan, Jupiter. You said your master had new clothes, and of course he left his old ones at home. Now if you would like to be free, just let me dress up in your master's clothes and take his horse, and you take another horse and go as my servant, and we will go straight to the Union lines." "Walnow. Dat plan 'pear feasible, sure." Jupi- ter revolved it a moment. Then he went to his hut, and soon reappeared saying, "I's ready, massa." Jupiter got the horses under -saddle after showing Warran where he could find " massa's clothes." Warran equipped speedily, feeling there was some- thing to make him step round, in that " three days at   VICTORY.          73 most."  These were evidently the Captain's field clothes,and he would want them before returning to Yorktown. But that would be only a small loss. Here was a splendid pair of Colt's revolvers, and a tolerable sword. Warran supposed the man had his best sword with him, but if he had any better revolvers than these, they must have been made in England. He examined them. They were loaded. Probably this newly made Captain had laid aside his pistols as un- necessary weapons to be carried on a visit to his family. And as he had the keys of his own castle, and knew no other mode of entrance but through the door, felt that his goods were safe at home. "What a splendid animal!" exclaimed Warran, as he caught sight of the Captain's horse; "a true Arabian. Those finely shaded spots will hardly be matched in the whole Rebel army. Jupiter,this is for- tunate. Such a horse will be known, all through the lines. I guess we shall not need the pistols in order to pass, if only it is a little dark." The horse showed his metal when once mounted, and it was true steel. Warran would have been will- ing to risk his life in a chase, with this fine Arabian to carry him. He did not believe there was a horse in the whole Confederacy that could overtake him unless weary with long travel. After trying his speed a few minutes, he remembered that it was not far from a hundred miles to the Union lines, and checked this noble animal that he might reserve his strength pr the last of the journey, which possibly would be a little more perilous than galloping along this open and ui- guarded highway. 7   74        V I CTORY. On looking back, Warran observed that Jupiter had an immense bundle on the pommel of his saddle. "What hive you got there, Jupiter?" "O, dis ain de commissarirat, massa. Or to speak widout a figger, dis am de hoe-cake an' de oats for de voyage " "Possibly we may have to hurry our speed before this journey is over, and wont your oats be in the way there?" "O, if it comes to dat, massa, you see I's drop 'em quicker'n lightnin'. But I's t'ink we's eat 'em." It was late in the afternoon before they stopped to rest their animals, and by a survey of the country, Warran felt sure they had made good progress. They took their lunch leisurely, and stretched themselves out in the shade while the horses champed their oats and took a breathing spell. Then they resumed their journey with accelerated speed. The horses were as fresh as though they had not already travelled far enough for a single day. There seemed to be nothing to hurry a Confederate officer so furiously, but Jupiter said, "Massa always go dashing;" so Warran but kept up his character. Had any one seen them feeding their horses by the side of a footpath in the woods, they doubtless would have wondered at the officer's parsimony, for that was before the great decline in Davis' paper. But Warran thought it better to injure Captain Rushback's repu- tation slightly, than run the risk of calling for dinner at a hotel where he might have dined the day before. In the room where he equipped himself in Confederate uniform, he had seen a portrait of the Captain, and   VICTORY.         75 observed that the likeness was not remarkably strik- ing, and could not be, however similar the horse and clothes. This fact made him especially careful to keep the felt hat a little slouched over his very white fore- head, a precaution not necessary to hide any differ- ence of complexion after having ridden a few miles in Virginia dust. Warran wanted to wash himself in a little pond near where they lunched, but Jupiter interposed,'and hin- dered the much-needed ablution. "Massa's jes as brack as ace o' spades, an' de more brack you get, de more you look like massa; don't wash him off, nohow " So with the satisfying reflection that he looked more and more like " massa," Warran spurred his horse and galloped on. About nine o'clock they came to the Rebel defences at Yorktown. There was a sparse line of pickets thrown out, and Warran thought these new soldiers were not sufficiently learned in the -practices of war to offer much resistance should he attempt to run the guard. He would only do this as the last expedient, however, first riding up as though he had an undoubted right to pass. "Halt, and give the password." I have been out of camp a few days, and do not know it." "Who are you, then? if you have not Athe pass- word, give us your name." "Captain Rushback and servant, of the Fifth Vir- ginia." Picket, drawing near - "Ah, Captain Rushback; I remember that horse; you can pass."   76        VICTORY, And Captain Rushback's horse, with its light rider, passed on towards the Union lines. Did Warran have any intimations during that swift ride, of the near presence, at one moment of his prog- ress, of the bright little nurse who saved his life? I have no record that any such intimation sent the hot blood in swifter currents through his heart, and yet I know he passed the hut where she lay in her first restful sleep after the fiery fever. Within a few rods of its lowly door his charger's hoofs stirred swiftly the light saind, but whether their almost noiseless fall disturbed her restful sleep I do not know. I think on that day when so much hopeful and aspiring life almost brushed her with its electric currents, she heard in her dreams a voice calling her back from "the valley of the shadow of death," fuller of the heart's longing and desire than ever comes but once to the inner ear of woman. The James crept lazily along its winding channel, the pines upon its bank heard no whisper, the heavens above were serene as a Christian's heart, and the earth echoless and dumb; but I believe, in the silent spaces which divided this pale sleeper from the heroic soul of the passing soldier, unseen angels flitted on swift wings from each to each, weaving the even meshes of destiny. From that hour there were promises of life in the eye and on the cheek of the wasted girl.   VII. '"Will our hunters be turned from their purpose and prey? Will their hearts fail within them? their nerves tremble, when All roughly they ride to the hunting of men?" A EN the hospital life began to stir on the morn- ing after Warran's escape, and our sleepy Rebel looked round for his clothes, and in course of time comprehended the situation, there was a general storm. All Richmond rung, in the course of an hour, with news of the escaped Yankee. A general search was instituted, everybody expect- ing to find the sick fellow curled up under a bush in his own garden. Captain Rushback returned from a pleasant morning drive with his family, to learn of the wonderful exploit. He had been in one little battle, and knew the Yankees were not weak. If they thought they could do a thing, they did it. He was not one to believe that our hero would be found in anybody's garden within twenty miles of Richmond. If he left the hospital, he would take a bee line towards the mouth of the James. Captain Rushback convinced the 'authorities that a soldier knew more than a civilian about such escapes, and they made him leader of a pursuing party, which, well equipped'with horse and sword, started out of the city in high 7*    (77)   78        VICTORY. spirits and at good speed. The Captain had reached his own plantation without any signs of the runaway Yankee, and as his new clothes were suffering some- what with the dust of this four-abreast ride, he invited the party to halt while he made some changes in his apparel and got his own horse and pistols. He expected to have use for the pistols. They were safer weapons than a sword, when after an escaped Yankee. And then his own horse he was used to and could ride him with greater ease. The party alighted, and Cap- tain R. proceeded to unlock the door of his fine old mansion. Seating his guests in the parlor, he went to his own room to adjust his outer man to the dusty experiences of Virginia travellers. He thought he remembered just where he hung the old clothes. But he remembered being under a little excitement at the vision of grandeur and military renown which greeted him from his mirror, after donning the new clothes; so he was not so sure he remembered, and began to hunt for them. Every nook and cranny in the large old house was ransacked, where it was possible for an old coat to find a hiding-place, but the old coat with shoulder-straps was not found. Then he went to the drawer where he always laid hispistols, and no pistols were in the drawer. He rushed down stairs and told his guests that his house had certainly been robbed, and looking toward the James he sought to satisfy himself whether the Yankee gunboats had really anchored off against his plantation. Strange to tell, he did not think of the Yankee he was hunting in this connection. He saw no sign of gunboat or transport; then observing that the horses still stood without   VICTORY.          79 care, he hallooed for Jupiter. The slaves were wind- ing in from their places of toil, to refresh themselves on dabs and hoe-cake. Sambo hastened at massa's well-known call. "  massa, massa I ' said Sambo, affecting to blub- ber, "Jupiter am clar gone off wid a soger, an' massa's best hosses gone too." "Jupiter  Soldier I What do you mean you black rascal?  "I seed em gone down de road, an' I t'ink it am massa, sure, but Sal she say a soger eat her hoe-cake in de mornin', and de next ting him an' Jupiter expa- tiate down de road on massa's horse, an' de soger got massa's clothes, sure." "A cursed Yankee trick!" said Rushback, in white rage. "Let us chase the contemptible thief- and if we catch him!" The' hunters mounted, and without superabundant pity for horse-flesh did chase the white runaway and the black. Whether the stolen clothes and pistols, the stolen horses, or the stolen " nigger " served most to fire the Captain's heart and accelerate his speed it would be difficult to state. When he saw the thick layers of dust hiding the gloss of his sleeves and the gleam of his new shoulder-straps, he thought of his second best suit, and spurred his horse, solacing his chafing spirit with plans for " skinning that Yankee thief, when once he should catch him!" The fact of having to spur his horse quite fre- quently, turned his attention from the fast fading new uniform, to keen and regretful memories of his match- less Arabian, which "if he only mounted him could   80        VICTORY. catch all the Yankeesin Christendom." Alas - he did not bear Captain Rushback with his fleet and sure step --" but a miserable Yankee abolitionist, who not content with his clothes and his horse and his revol- vers, had taken his best nigger. If ever he caught Jupiter - and he would catch him, there'd be a few less cowhides on his plantation. He'd wallop him within an inch of his life." And Captain R. foamed about as furiously as his galloping, foaming steed.  Sometimes his aids checked him, telling him that he would use up his horse in the first of the heat, and quite likely would need his strength most towards the last. But the Captain was in a rage which did not abate, the more he soliloquized, and the faster he galloped, but contrariwise intensified and deepened. So being in a rage he would not hear to reason. And they galloped, and cantered, and raced, till checked by the voice of the pickets at Yorktown, crying " halt," and the gleaming steel of three or four pointed bayonets. "Let me pass I " shouted the leader. "Give me the countersign and then you can pass." "I don't know it. I have been away since day before yesterday." "Who are you?" demanded the guard. "Captain Rushback of the Fifth Virginia." "That's a  pretty story. Captain Rushback has passed these lines and gone into camp. You can't cheat me, I know the horse." "You fool, you are duped. A miserable runaway Yankee stole my horse, and my best nigger, and you've let him pass, have you? In camp, I reckon I They   VICTORY.          81 are in Newport News by this time, behind Yankee cannon. How long since they passed?" "Not long. You can catch them if you hurry." The Captain rushed on. The. display of military power at his back quite convinced the picket of the truth of his story, and he let the party pass. Had the Captain been a wise man he would have ridden into camp and changed horses; but he was not wise, at least not then, for he was angry, and the prospect of soon overtaking the fugitives quite overshadowed his discretion. He felt very sure they would soon bein his grasp. Of course they would ride more leisurely after passing the Rebel lines, thinking their own danger ended. So the Captain thought in the midst of his excitement and hot haste. The night was almost like day from the clear shining of the full moon, and each moment the pursuers expected to overtake their victims. They had ridden several miles, they knew not how far, from the Rebel encampment. Cap- tain Rushback was several rods ahead, dashing on at full speed. "I see them," he muttered in a hoarse whisper. Jupiter, ever on the alert, and watchful as the eye WK of fate, exclaimed suddenly - "I hear bosses. Massa am arter us, sure," and' looking over his shoulder he caught a glimpse of the horsemen coming furiously on. Warran spurred the Arabian, who shot off like an arrow, and seemed as safe and fleet to his rider asa flying cloud. Jupiter urged his horse to its utmost speed and for awhile he kept near his new master. The pursuers saw that they were- discovered, and now they redoubled theirs   82        VICTORY. efforts to hurry the jaded horses. For awhile they seemed to keep almost even pace. There was the taunting figure of the Yankee, and the ingrate Jupiter nearing the Union lines and liberty-" but they should not reach them " -vowed Captain Rushback. "I will kill my horse first in the chase." HHe felt for his pistols, but it was not safe pistol-shot yet. He would get nearer. So he spurred his horse for one final plunge. Jupiter was falling behind. His horse was tired out - not used to this severe racing. Cap- tain Rushback felt again for his pistols. "-Fury!" He had no pistols. "They were in the pocket of the cursed Yankee." He turned to his aids and commanded them to fire, and bring Jupiter to terms. Only one of them had anything to fire with. They had started out after an escaped hospital patient, without thought of opposi- tion. This one took aim at the black. Jupiter tum- bled off his horse. They were soon at the spot expecting to find a dead " nigger." But the road was clear, and only the worn horse to be found where they had seen Jupiter fall. "Let the nigger go," said Rushback, "and now catch my Arabian and the Yankee thief; time enough to look for the nigger when we have finished Lincoln's hound." ,The man of the pistol fired -he fired again. They were random shots, and too far to take effect had they been well aimed. The balls whistled in mid-air, but they did not touch Warran. He slackened his pace, thinking he would find out how many of his pursuers were armed. The pistol wakened the echoes again at   VICTORY.          83-. a nearer distance. Then there was a sharp reply, and the foremost reeled in his saddle, and fell heavily to the ground. Another nervous pull at the only pistol lock in the company - a snap --but no report. "Good God I We are lost I " exclaimed the Rebel. "It is my last shot," and turning their horses, they attempted to flee. The swift Arabian was after them, and his rider was armed. Another report shocked the still air, and the terrified pursuers; and a riderless horse plunged on towards safety. Warran shouted to them to " surren- der, or they would all be in eternity in five minutes." Just then, from another direction, in front, instead of rear, a'bullet whizzed about their ears. It did not take effect. Another followed-it, and then another. Front, and rear I They were surrounded I But no enemy was visible before them. An unseen hand had sent another riderless horse madly onward. Three had fallen. The remaining five saw only death staring them in the face. They halted. They surrendered. Better this, than to hear again the sound of that unerring pistol and the mysterious shots from the visionless air. It was humiliating for five strong men, with gleaming swords in their -belts, to surrender to one contemptible Yankee--but it was better than death - and they knew their escape was fruitless with the fleet Arabian after them, and pistols in his rider's possession. Warran commanded them to examine their Captain's wound and see if he was much hurt. While they were binding it up, Jupiter crawled out of some under- brush by the roadside.   84        VICTORY. "Are you hurt, Jupiter?" asked Warran. "t No, massa. Ise tumble off purpose. Ise no notion ole massa catchin' me." "A You fired well, Jupiter. Let us now look after the other fallen men." They found one of them dead. The shot of the slave had been fatal. Warran only attempted to wound his pursuers-but he feared Captain Rush- back's hurt would be very serious. The other fallen man, in the hurry and confusion of the surrender, had made his escape. They could not readily find him, and so copcluded that his wound was very slight indeed, though his fright was evidently tremendous. In the swift gallop of Warran and Jupiter towards the Union lines, there was some conversation, of which we have not taken note. As a part of it may serve to explain the mysterious shots, we will record it. As the two came near the Rebel lines at Yorktown, Jupiter said - "Massa, gib me one ob de pistols, please." "But you could not use it, and then it could not serve us in peril. You never fired a pistol, did you?" "Massa, who gib you de underground keys to de ole house where de little guns was found?" "You, Jupiter." "It am reasonable to suppose dat a nigger will 'prove his opportunity, when he know dat guns open de way to liberty." "Take the pistol, Jupiter. And if we need to use them - be steady. " Captain Rushback was removed from the highway to a grassy spot where his reclining posture might be   VICTORY,          85 less painful to him. The horses were secured where they could nibble at leisure, and Jupiter was left to watch. With his master's sword buckled at his side he felt quite safe in the presence of the wounded man. Then ordering the Rebels to march, Warran took up his position in their rear, and in less than half an hour he had delivered his prisoners to the commanding officer at Newport News. An ambulance was sent for Captain Rushback, and Jupiter rode proudly be- hind it, leading " ole massa's " horse. When once under the folds of the starry flag, Warran Watts felt that henceforth it would have a new meaning to him. He had sought its shelter from the gaping doors of a prison, whose hungry maw might have taken him into black starvation. He had ridden for life as well as liberty- but he was safe now from his mad pursuers. He could hold up the shining stars of freedom's banner with added strength. Two more hands had been given to him and liberty, and he should be stronger for the help of Jupiter. A Captain's shoulder-straps were given to our hero, as an acknowledgment of his heroic exploit, and after a few days he rejoined his regiment under the eaves of Washington, and Jupiter went with him. 8   --C HAPTER- VIII. "Dim burns the boat-lamp; shadows deepen round, From giant trees, with snake-like creepers wound, And the black water glides without a sound." HLE Bell Winton was obliged to stay in a slave lf y i hut waiting for strength to pursue her journey, she improved the time in talking with the negroes on the providential meaning of the war, as it had gradually revealed itself to her reflective mind. She found they were not ignorant upon the subject, that her thoughts were not new to them. They had long looked for deliverance from the house of bondage, and when the North and South took up arms, they felt that the cannon and sword were intimations of the long-ex- pected day of freedom. None of the slaves had yet escaped from this plantation. They had acted as helpers to many others in greater straits, but as yet had chosen to watch and wait, and abide their time. Their master was in the army, and they felt such a sense of freedom in his absence, that they thought they had already obtained the coveted boon. He had been one of the hardest wasters anywhere in Virginia. All the implements of torture available to this peculiar institution were to be found in abundant supply on Colonel Hate's plantation. Here Bell saw for the first time the famous .gag, which is used to straighten (86)   VICTORY.          87- refractory " niggers " and bring them to terms. As her thin fingers touched the rough, cold iron, and she examined the tongue-piece, the bands for the head, and the jagged pendants which are so arranged as to keep the victim from bending his neck-in the slightest degree, without inflicting wounds upon the shoulders, she felt a new strength to follow her mother's counsel, and a purpose outside of herself urging her on. She dashed this barbarous instrument to the earth, and said in the ears of her sable listeners- "So will I use the strength which God lends me, in breaking the bands of the slave." In the months which Bell had been under their roof, these people had learned to idolize her. They looked upon her as an oracle, and remembered all her words. Even the ravings of her insanity were carefully treas- ured, and they knew she suffered in some way because she was their friend. They were ready to do any- thing for her comfort and safety, and ready to follow her anywhere. When she talked about seeking the Union lines, they remembered their old-scars. While their master was in the army they were well enough off; but then they might be sold. "Couldn't 'spect dese good times to last alters," said old Phillis. "Massa get killed, mebbe, den we'se sold down Souf, and mebbe massa get hurt and come home, and dat ar' wus'n down Souf." One night they were all assembled in Phillis's hut. Bell told them 'she should start on the following even- ing to feel her way towards the mouth of the James. "Shall I go alone? said she. A single voice an-, swered, "Missus shall nebber go 'lone."   88        VICTORY. The next night came. Bell had on her boy's clothes and her shining mask. A little bundle containing some provisions for the journey, lay upon the rude table. She was alone in the hut. She thought Phillis had gone to call the slaves that she might bid them good by. Presently she appeared, and filing behind her came every negro, big and little, on the planta- tion. Bell extended her hand to each in turn, thank- ing them for all they had done for her in her helpless weakness, and last she came to Robert, who had said, on the previous night, "Missus shall nebber go 'lone." "I will not bid Robert good by," she said; " he is going with me ;" and the two went out of the hut. Tramp, tramp, came behind them the sound of feet. Bell looked, - they were all coming. "Robert am only our spokeman," said Phillis; "we'se all goin' wid Miss Bell, after freedom." Bell was both glad and sorry for this. She was glad to see the one great desire for liberty moving them as one man. But she was sorry about the little children. They would impede the progress of the fugitives, and render escape less certain. It was her own safety which Bell thought of just then. In a moment she was stronger and nobler, and turning to this sable retinue, she said, "I am glad you are all coming. We will seek liberty together, and if we gain it, well I and if not, I will share your fate, let it be what it will." The negroes were inspired and made strong by her brave words. For miles they marched on with tire- less pace, as elastic and light-hearted as .though they had suddenly been furnished with wings.   VICTORY.          89 The children were weary, and Bell thought they had better rest awhile. "Not yet,". said Robert, and he led the way through the dark woods to the banks of the James. , All ready," whispered a voice from out the shad- ows, as they neared the river. "We's hab a big load, won't we, Bob?" said the voice. "A big load," answered Robert, "but de raf am strong, I reckon. Dis here chile nebber learn de trade for nuffin; he lookin' for de time to use it for sumfin' better'n mendin' holes where massa's hoss kick through." Half a dozen shadows were visible on the banks of the river. They were the remnant of the plantation slaves where the raft had been constructed. Robert had been boss workman, but other hands had lent their willing aid, and a strong flat-boat lay moored in the shadow of the trees. The fugitives were speedily embarked, and they were soon gliding softly down the river. There was no puff of steam, no whistle of wind through sail or cordage, to attract the ear of the late pedestrian, if any such were near. -The tired women and children felt a sense of security akin to their sweet dream of liberty, and one after another they gave themselves up to the soothing influence of Lhe gliding motion of the raft, and were sound asleep.- Past forest and field, past the home of the master and the hut of the slave, past rock and bluff and marsh, they swept safely on, while the men kept watch over the little craft, and the stars in heaven kept watch over all. When the 8*   90        VICTORY. morning light broke over the world, touching with its impartial glory that land of suffering and wrong, that land where "God's image has been bought and sold like a beast in the market," so many thousand times, our little band of fugitives moored their craft and sought a hiding-place in the shelter of the woods. Some indignant master on the look-out for his run- aways, might descry them if they made a highway of the river in daylight, and they would avoid that peril if possible. It was a weary and anxious day. They could hardly brook any impediment in the way of their escape towards the Union lines and liberty. And they were in constant fear of detection even in their forest hiding-place. Every flutter of wings, or snap of twig, set their hearts thumping until the little wood noises were a thousand times increased, and magni- fied into the galloping hoofs of the slave-hunter, and the baying of his hounds. They hardly dared stir from their skulking-places behind trees and low under- brush, and before day waned they almost wished they had not depended upon the raft, but had separated in little squads, and marched through the woods. The day was so very long to these impatient hearts, I do not wonder they thought any means which would enable them to keep moving, better thin this quies- cence. Bell hushed their doubts by telling them the journey must of necessity be much longer by land, in order to keep continually in the woods; and then, there were Rebel defences across the Peninsula, which so large a party could hardly pass unobserved. There was a rustle of dead leaves and a snapping of twigs, regular and loud, as though produced by   VICTORY.          91 human footfalls. Every head nestled closer to mother earth. The noise came nearer, - there was more than one pair of feet. O, the terror of that moment  They were pursued. Bell peered over the log where she lay, and looked towards the sound. She was thinking of Madbury. "It is a white woman," she whispered, " and there are children with her." Robert started up. "Dat am no white woman; dat am a slave." "Rachel," he called, and gliding towards her, the two clasped hands. "O, Robert, I have been a week in the woods try- ing to find the Union lines, and I am so tired, and the children are near starving." Bell looked, - there were three children, white and fair as herself. She had seen mulattoes and quad- roons, - she had seen children of slave mothers, white as a brunette; but this golden hair, and these blue eyes quite astonished her. Shall I say this vision touched a hidden deep in the fountain of her heart? That she felt her sympathy melting into tears as she looked upon these fair girls, and remembered the fate of the slave? She had seen the auction-block, and knew what it meant in all the marts of the South; and it is not strange if she shuddered in profounder horror as she pictured a golden-haired Saxon standing under the hammer. Bell was the daughter of a slave- master, and she had made rapid strides towards the light, in a very brief time, for one accustomed always to life at the South. Already she stood upon a higher plane than many who have breathed, their life long, only Northern air, and worshipped at the shrine of  8   92        VICTORY. Liberty. She had a deep and true sympathy for the slave, and a righteous hatred of the institution so long defended by the strong arm of law. But I must be true to facts in this record, and not hesitate to tell you that she felt a deeper indignation, a holier horror, and a firmer purpose, when she saw the accursed sys- temrn touching the hem of the Saxon's robe. Was she right in this? I grant you it was perfectly natural. Our pride of race, our self-superiority, will speedily assert itself, if any contaminating influence despoils us of the least tithe of our vaunted glory. We can  [ see a mulatto toiling under the lash of the driver, and j not let it greatly disturb our equanimity. But let one or two generations whiten this wine-hued face, and we are appalled. We are almost frantic. "En- slave that man?  Why, he is white; you must not    touch the white race with your slavery." Very natural I grant--but not Christian. A feel- ing which springs of selfalove--not the ripe, fresh    fruit of humble consecration. God demands of us more than this, and we  must give it before he will accept our penitence and conversion as sincere. We must detest slavery, because it touches the lowly black, keeping away from his race every avenue of self-help, despoiling him of his inherited birthright, and coining him into gold to swell the coffers of his Caucasian master. We must keep silent our pro- fessions of sympathy, and bury in a napkin our vaunted faith in human brotherhood, if we are not ready to do this. They are only as sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal. Every lesson on the pages of our Lord's last will and testament, is one of love and care for the   VICTORY.          93 lowly and the oppressed. He mingled with this humble class while he stayed upon the earth. He had no splendid mansion where to sit at ease, with slaves to do His bidding, but it was He who said - did we ever hear it?-" the Son of man hath not where to lay his head." His companions were poor, like him- self, and if the sun of that Eastern clime had bronzed their faces, I think it made no difference to Him who came as the exponent of that higher law we should all revere, and the representative of Him who " made of one blood all nations of men."   Ah, my Caucasian brother! Put a bit in the mouth of your pride of race until you have learned to fill your life-record with fairer deeds than the past can show - until you have learned to follow the Christ whom you profess to revere. When I see you touched by the terror of this crime of the ages, because it holds the black man in its chains; when I see you strike at it with heavy blows because you would help this de- graded brother to his share in man's inalienable rights,  I shall believe you are converted, and'hope to see God's pardon fall upon you as a benediction. When I see my Country, in her Senate Halls, strike at this monster , because it oppresses a lowly people, and shuts out from them every hope which makes life dear, --instead of making " military necessity " or even national life the pretext for the blows she strikes, --I shall hope to see peace descend upon my country, and a true national life spring up in the'footprints of God's avenger, which now lays waste the land, and shakes the pillars of our Republic. It is not enough to be simply natural. Let us be Christian.   "       VICTORY. Rachel and the children were fed, and while Robert lingered near them watching and helping, Bell thought she saw a glory about his face which made it almost beautiful. She had scarcely looked at this man before. Was he transfigured, or had she been blind? Slhe thought she had seen him, but never until now had she discovered that proud and exultant look. Some tew thought nobler than before, must be writing his face with those triumphant lines; or maybe he thought only of the four more slaves who would soon be free. As Bell Winton gazed, almost transfixed by the scene, first upon the white group and then upon Robert, she discovered that he was not so black as most of their fugitive party. "Somewhat darker than Rachel "- mused Bell--" but not a mulatto,- there's a good deal of white blood in Robert--look at his face, and his tall, lithe figure I " Well, many of the slaves had white blood in their veins - what of that I Soon the night shadows gathered, and the fugitives sought the river. There were four more souls to occupy their ark, but no matter if there were four hundred, if only it could -outride the waters and bear them safely to land and liberty. Rachel's face bright- ened as she saw this help for the journey. She was foot-sore and weary, and the children were almost worn out with their marching and starvation. Again they swept lazily down the river, and again the women and children slept. All at once the air resounded with the baying of hounds - they had been traced to the river. Rachel and Bell were awakb in an instant. "O Robert, what shall we do?" said Rachel.   VICTORY.          95 "Keep still and go along," answered Robert. Every soul upon the ark caught the words,-" keep still." If the pursuers were near they could not reach the river bank in that tangled wild. No horse- man could ride there. They must seek the highway and strike the river at the next opening. Meanwhile, hope cheered them with the promise of passing the next opening first. The noise of the hounds grew indistinct as the raft glided farther and farther from its day moorings, and one after another of the fugi- tives again fell asleep, until the women and children were all lost in dreams--all but Bell and Rachel. Not yet had the fear of Madbury's hounds left the heart of Bell Winton. So fierce and terrible was the man she would escape, that she coupled him in her thoughts with every evil design which it was possible for man to undertake. She thought of no hounds but his, and did not dream there could be a more terrible fear in the heart of any on board the little raft. So natural is it to think our own fate the darkest, and our own trouble the deepest. Rachel felt an alarm which Bell could but dimly understand. She had fled from a fate more terrible than marriage with a buyer and seller of :slaves. For years she had been a captive in the embrace of a life more terrible than death. How she had beat her prison bars, none but herself could ever know, and even now these walls of death would inclose her, but for the war. Her master had become absorbed in the one great theme which touched all hearts, North and South. The war--its promises of success to the Confederate cause, and of utter humiliation, and   96        VICTORY. perhaps extinction to abolitionism, opened before him so glorious a prospect of undisturbed repose in the sensuous life he was living, that for a time he was. utterly dazzled and blinded. He forgot to keep his rigid watch over Rachel. He even went to Richmond without putting her under guard. She availed her- self of this favorable moment and escaped with her children. The sun and stars guided her-they were propitious lights, to the banks of the James - to the strong protection of Robert. "What was Robert to her?"He was her husband. They were slaves of the same master, and had grown up on the same plan- tation. They could not remember the day nor the hour when they began to love each other. When they were yet very young, scarcely more than children, Rachel told Robert her fears. From time to time they talked over their prospects, trying to hit upon some plan for escape from this man, but the way was hedged. They had to be very guarded in their manner towards each other, and continually on the watch lest their master should find out the secret of their love. They were privately married by a minister who was a friend to Robert, and who had no suspicions that he was in any way wronging the master by the ceremony. But they could not always keep their secret. Rachel forgot she was a slave, and in a moment of the utmost provocation asserted her right as Robert's wife. Her master was enraged, and poured out his fury in bit- terest maledictions. But he would not be foiled. He had paid a high price for Rachel when she was but a baby. He remembered counting out the gold up there   VICTORY.         97 on the borders of Maryland, under the very shadow of her historic Heights. He knew why he paid the heavy price. Rachel belonged to him, and "if any sneaking nigger on his plantation expected he was going to turn out this white slave to herd with him, he would find his mistake; Bob was too white to have round, anyhow-why had he not thought of this danger before " Robert was immediately sold, and his master sup- posed him toiling in some rice or cotton field of the South, but he was mistaken. A planter who wanted a driver for his hands, offered a premium to the man who bought him and he stayed in Virginia, not many miles from Rachel. It was something to be near her. Possibly he might hear an occasional word through the slaves, and he would contrive some means to tell her he was-not sold down South. He did contrive means to communicate with Rachel, notwithstanding the strict surveillance practised over her. She was filled with joy to know that Robert was near her-- and he chafed like a caged lion- but could not help his fate. Why should he treasure in his heart, love for this woman? They were slaves. No marriage cove- nant is honored by the slave-master, unless it suits his will and his interest. Robert knew all this when he felt the tendrils of fate clinging closer and closer about him. He knew it- and tried to be- indifferent - but it was no use. He was a man; and though he had a will like iron, his heart was stronger than all, and he believed he had a right to follow its dictation. So these two, separated by time and distance, were yet one in soul, and with one hope they watched and 9 r '.i   98        VICTORY. waited. Now they were sweeping down the James towards certain liberty -if they could only reach in safety the Fortress which guards the mouth of the river. *   CHAPTE'R IX. "We in suffering, they in crime, Wait the just award of time, Wait the vengeance that is due. -Not in vain a heart shall break, Not a tear for freedom's sake Fall unheeded; God is true." VERY wakeful eye watched the shore, as they passed the next clearing. They had ventured farther from land, and the men used their oars, -they were going swifter for this. Rachel felt sure she dis- cerned'the dark outline of a horseman standing upon the bank. She watched the figure in silent terror. What if it were her master! He had ere this returned from Richmond, and she knew he would search for her with the determination of a man who knew no law but his own will. There was a "halloo" from the bank, but of course no answer. Two of them knew the voice, and felt in their inmost souls that they would face death before he should ever again divide them. "Come to land this instant, or I'll fire among you, you black runaways." The raft kept on. Mr. Spencer saw no signs of coming to land. He took out his pistol and in the starlight dimness fired at the dark, floating mass. He kept on firing, not stopping until he had exhausted his two six-shooters. By this time, the raft was too far (99)   100       VICTORY. away for pistol shot to reach it. Mr. Spencer did not reload, but wheeling his horse rode away. On board the raft there was consternation and dis- tress. A child had been instantly killed; and Rachel- poor Rachel, was hurt; she had fainted. They looked for the wound. The bright blood trickled from her sleeve, and they found that a bullet had pierced her arm. There was no surgeon among these people, but there were those who knew how to bind up wounds, and Rachel's arm was speedily wrapped in a handkerchief taken from the head of one of the women. Dipping their hands in the river they sprinkled her face - it was their only restorative. She came to, and inquired if Robert was safe. Robert sat there moodily leaning his head upon his hands. He started on hearing his name, and bent over the woman who had spoken it. "Yes, Rachel, I am safe. And I shall live until I have taken vengeance on that man." "O Robert, he will watch the shore and fire at us again; he will watch us as long as he dare, for fear of Yankee cannon." "1 We will go to the other side .of the river and then he can neither see nor reach us. I am afraid he will call help from the soldiers at Yorktown - I have no fear of him alone." "But there may be watchers on the other side." "Not yet. He has doubtless traced you to the river by the help of his dogs - and the raft is a new thing to him. Does your arm ache, Rachel?" "Some. But that is nothing - you are safe - and the children." Gradually they neared the Southern shore of the   VICTORY.         101 river, and at daybreak two of them landed and scooped out a shallow grave for the child. There were silent tears dropped above the little sleeper - the child had a mother. But no matter for her, she was black. The fugitives discussed the matter of going on shore for the day, and decided not to do so. If they were watched, they would be safer on the river. As long as the banks offered tolerable protection to their little craft they kept under motion; and when they could no longer feel safe under the glaring eye of day, they put into a little cove, and moored their raft until evening. They were all anxious and watchful-Bell and Rachel more than all. Rachel thought it singular that a black boy should be so alert. He could have no I     such terror to escape as was whitening her cheek, and sending the hot blood so swiftly through her aching heart. ' A slight noise turned every eye shoreward. It might have been only a rabbit's tread, but it was well enough to look. There might be hunters skulking behind the trees- hunters of that anomalous creature called in human edicts, both beast and man. Not ?:!: made a beast by such naming -not even made so by centuries of beastly usage, though how deeply he has been degraded by the servile life which man has forced upon him - only God, who calls him man, and not a Su'    beast -can fully know. It was not a rabbit's tread, it was not the footfall of the hunter of slaves. Every face brightened, at the sight of an ebon-hued head peering from behind a tree. Bell could not keep her joy behind the sunny i        .   9*"   102       VICTORY. ripples of her face. She could not make the mask look glad. She had to speak. "Come here, Dick, come and tell me about my father." Dick needed no second invitation, but darting from his leafy screen he was almost instantly upon the raft, and by the side of Bell Winton. "O Miss Bell, we's 'fraid you gone dead." "Tell me, Dick, is my father well?" "Massa well 'nough guess, but he am awful cross. Dis nigger couldn't stood it nohow, so he 'scape. Massa lick me dreadful - wus den eber, cos him tink me know sumfin' 'bout Miss Bell." a"Why does he suspect you, Dick?" "Why old Pompey he say a black boy come dere seekin' de Union lines, and de hounds track Miss Bell from massa door to Pompey's, and massa, him t'ink, dis chile's jacket jes suit Miss Bell, so him 'speck some sort ob contribance 'tween us." "Is Madbury in Richmond now?" "Him's clear gone off. Him's dreadful mad cos -Miss Bell got away, and de Yankee got away, so him full ob fight. Las time dis chile seen de ole debble, him gallopin' off two forty, wid shinin' shoulder-straps on him. Golly, wish I's a Yankee. Dem shinin' shoulder-straps make a good shootin' mark." Bell's heart leaped for joy at this piece of informa- tion. If Madbury had taken to shoulder-straps, his passion for dogs would have a little time to rest. She should have no more terror of his hounds. Bell plied Dick with questions until she learned how time had passed under her father's roof, during the   VICTORY.         103 months of her absence. Among other interesting items, she learned that her Aunt Mary had visited her father to condole with him upon the sudden disappearance of his daughter. When she returned she carried several additional trunks, which "mamma" and Nance had carefully stored with "Miss Bell's wardrobe." This - made her heart leap somewhat joyfully. Aunt Mary would be watching for her, and she had been saved the pain of repeating the story of Madbury and her escape. Other tongues, faithful to her, had told it, and she knew it would need no additions so far as the slavedealer was concerned. She had linked her fate with the race which had furnished him so many vic- tims, instead of the purse-proud owner, and she could rehearse their helpfulness and fidelity. If Aunt Mary believed in slavery she knew she could shake her faith - but she didn't think the home servants would trust her so if she did. Aunt Mary must be one in whom she could confide. But in the midst of her pleasant thoughts, she remembered that Newherne was a good way off, and she had -not yet reached the coveted asylum, and worse, might never reach it. The brief December day waned into night, and with the earliest shadow the fugitives were again under motion. Another night would bring them nearer to the morning of freedom for which they had so long silently waited and prayed. It was an anxious night. If no disaster happened to them, they hoped to be beyond the reach of hound or hunter; yet who could tell what perils yet awaited them. Life had been to them so full of despair, they dared hardly anticipate a future of better things. There was little sleep save   104       VI CTO  . among the children. Each heart was busy with its individual fears. They did not know the extent of the soldierly preparations on the Peninsula, and their torrid imaginations magnified them greatly. They hugged the Southern shore as closely as practicable until morning dawned, and then took a diagonal course across the river. The tide was favorable, and they made good headway in the crossing. No one on board could tell their exact whereabouts, but they trusted they were beyond the Rebel defences. This trust however did not abate their vigilance. Every tree and bush was watched for protruding guns, as they came near enough to land to distinguish the muzzle of a musket. Robert and Rachel knew that Mr. Spencer would seek aid in his mad hunt for the white fugitives, and if they should touch the shore within Rebel lines, they were lost. For six hours they had run very rapidly with the tide. It was turning now and would somewhat impede their progress how- ever strong the help at the oars. It was their purpose to abandon the raft, and try skulking through the woods.- a practice which the slave has learned in the endeavor to find his way towards the North star. They neared the shore with trembling hearts, and as they were rapidly preparing to land, Bell Winton cast her eye along the blue reach of the river towards the spot which was once her home. Instantly she descried a steamer ploughing the water with its utmost speed. Her first thought was of Rachel's pursuer. She whispered the word, and every eye caught sight of the furious little- craft. With one single thought each heart beat faster and faster,-   V I CTOY         105 they were pursued H The horseman who had descried them from the shore, had taken the river for his high- way, and no doubt felt sure of his victims. They could not even hope that they were yet unobserved by the crew of the steamer. Indeed they imagined they could see a spyglass levelled at them. If ever a party of voyagers touched land with thankful hearts, it was our fugitive party. Certain danger on the river made them less fearful of imaginary guns on shore. They rushed up the bank and through the woods, not forgetting that their course lay towards the sunrise. They saw no Rebel guns. Noteven a solitary soldier appeared to frighten them. The country seemed for- saken, or dead. It was silent as the river. Mr. Spencer, on the steamer, with his glass sweep- ing the river, descried the fugitives, as they crossed to the northern shore. He ordered the fireman to accel- erate speed. He walked the deck and foamed and swore, as he saw them preparing to land. His hope lay in overtaking them on the river. But he would steam on and head them, then send men on shore in the boats. They had not escaped him by abandoning the raft. So Mr. Spencer steamed on. He had becn steaming all night, and at dawn the sight of the fugi- tives, made him oblivious to everything else. He forgot to take his reckonings; or perhaps he thought in those moments, when the object of his chase seemed almost within his grasp, that he owned the whole river, as really as Rachel and the children. Mr. Spencer ought not to have been Captain just then, but he was, and so he ordered the utmost speed until he thought he was far enough ahead of the runaways to   106       VICTORY. send out the boats. They had run as near shore as was practicable, that the boats might not have far to row, and were preparing to unfasten and man them, when a shot came whizzing along and struck the water a few feet in advance.   . "What does this mean?" cried Mr. Spencer- "where are we?" Mr. S. seemed to have forgotten about the war. For several minutes past the stars and stripes had gleamed and fluttered in full view, without awakening the first anxious thought. But we need not wonder. Mr. S. was born under that flag, and did not think at the moment that the act of secession made it any the less his. Another shot made him think that hunting fugitives was perilous business. Something unusual had hap- pened. That flag meant liberty, and his nefarious business was coming to an end. Some of the crew helped him to a solution of the matter. Gradually the slave-hunter came to understand that he had run his little craft under the guns of Fort Monroe, and there was no help but surrender. The steamer was coming shoreward, and so the gunners hesitated to fire. But so fearful were the Rebel crew of another broadside from the frowning Fortress that they ran up a white flag and came to land. Mr. Spencer explained his errand to the officer in command. The fugitives had not yet arrived, but he informed the General, that he should demand their surrender, under the provisions of the "Fugitive Slave Bill." Indeed, sir I " replied the General, "I thought   VICTORY.         107 Virginia had seceded from the Government of the United States. Do you expect the protection of the Government against which you have rebelled?" "We expect you to enforce the laws, and if our niggers escape to yo*, we shall demand them again." "Ah I Pray what relation do these negroes sustain to you? Are they a portion of your family?" "They are our property, sir, and as such we de- mand them." "Well then, if they are property, and as such are used to help your rebellious cause, I shall be obliged to detain them as contraband of war. I would farther inform you that your steamer is confiscated, and your- self and crew are prisoners." "You have no business to detain me as a prisoner. I am not connected with the army, or the war." "Are you a Union man?" "I thank God I'm not one of Lincoln's hounds." "I suppose you prefer to be a slave hound; Captain R. take this Rebel into custody, and keep him until he comes to his senses." Our fugitives did not have to skulk long. Soon, in the distance they saw the folds of the " red, white, and blue," and knew their perilous march out of the house of bondage, was nearly consummated. As they filed into the Union lines, a shout of welcome greeted them which made them all think the day of jubilee had come. They soon ascertained that their advent had been anticipated. I think there were two of them who felt no especial grief on hearing how Mr. Spencer had run into prison. .' ,  $d   108        VICTORY. The story of Robert and Rachel was told to the General, and he took secret satisfaction in leading them to Mr. Spencer, and introducing them as freed- men whose marriage he could no longer interfere with. This wise Virginian, who had voted for secession to make more secure the "chief corner-stone" of the South, began to see that there was an immense blunder somewhere. To see his beautiful white slave arm in arm with her lawful husband, was a picture which he never dreamed could be sketched by the finger of secession. The earth must be very insecure about that corner-stone Let Mr. Spencer fret. Let him change colors like the chameleon. Let him see from his prison windows the thousands of black faces lighted up by a new joy as they go cheerfully about their labor. If he catches a glimpse of Rachel occasionally carrying drink to Robert, so much the better. It will help bring him to his senses. Perhaps in the course of time, if he lives on prison rations, and some North- ern traitor in blue don't furnish him whiskey, he may begin to see that slavery is not the "normal condition of the black race." It is possible he may so far open his eyes as to read the meaning of that sentence in our Declaration of Independence,--"All men are created free and equal." It would not be surprising if, in the natural course of events, he should discover, that our flag means Liberty. We will leave him now to his fate. When Bell Winton discovered thot she should have to wait for cannon to break the way before she could reach Newherne, she was a little impatient. She was   VICTORY.         109 tired of wearing men's clothes, and wanted access to the well-filled trunks transported in advance by Aunt Mary. Then she wondered what she could do amid this weary waiting. Not the heavy work about the Fortress; she was not strong enough for that. She wanted to lay off her mask. - She had not all the tender and docile traits of the race with which her outer guise connected her. She would not do them injustice by the show of impatience at this unexpected restraint upon free travel, but what could she do by which to count out the long and unknown hours. Dick. helped her to solve this question. "Missus, I's jes t'inkin' you better tell de General you's a woman. Cos if you don't dey'll be settin' ye onto some ob dese liftin' jobs round." "(I had rather it would not be known, Dick, unless I can have some of my own clothes to wear." {"Laws missus, you's de most 'spectable lookin' darkey in dese Union lines - wid my clothes on." '- But Dick, don't mention that I'm a girl unless there is some way for me to look like myself again." Dick had been prying round and knew there was some way. He had discovered that some of the officers had their wives with them. "Now, Miss Bell, you come long o, me, and I'll show ye a wrinkle." Bell went, and Dick conducted her to the quarters of some of the ladies whom he had discovered. Opening the door and leading Bell into their pres- ence, he said - "Yankee missus, dis am Miss Bell Winton, daughter ob Westgate Winton ob de city ob Richmond - my   "O       VICTORY. ole massa. Sure she look like a boy, but it am all in my clothes she's got on."' The ladies looked incredulous, until Bell spoke and told them a part of her history. Then they were all tenderness and helpfulness. They contributed from their wardrobes, and Bell was soon herself again. Dick waited until Bell reappeared from the dressing- room, and then, with his cap in his hand, said - "Missus, shall I hab de extremest pleasure to bring de carriage?" "O, Dick, don't mock. We are both fugitives with not so much as a shelter of our own." "Ha - ha - missus. Dick hab got jes as much shelter ob his own as eber- and more. De shelter ob liberty I An' Miss Bell - she am free from Mad- bury." "Yes, thank God." This thought made every other annoyance sink into insignificance. She could bear anything, free from fear of Madbury. "Now, Miss Bell, you say you want to do suthin'. Dick can't read. Nor Bob can't read. Nor Rachel, nor de children- nor none ob us." Bell's face brightened, and her whole attitude took on a new glory, as, rising to her feet she said - "I will teach you." She began her work immediately, with the enthu- siasm of a fresh and hopeful soul. In this work she could in some degree cancel the great wrong which had been done to this race, under the roof which was her paternal home. - "O if she could whiten her father's soul I " which she felt must be very dark from   VICTORY.          1" his participation in this crime of the ages. "How she would work for these benighted people I " How she did work I There were no more inquiries of "What shall I do?"She longed for superhuman strength, that she might accomplish more for her eager pupils.   ----- CHAPTER X. ' Thus, Freedom, on the bitter blast, The ventures of thy seed we cast; And trust to warmer sun and rain, To swell the germ and fill the grain." BURNSIDE'S cannon made a Union port of Rebel Newherne. Among the heroic soldiers who won immortal honor in those fearful fights which preceded the occupancy of the city, I find Warran Watts foremost in battle. His heroism was equalled only by the hardy endurance with which he marched through swamps and underbrush, through shot and shell, until the sheltering spires of the redeemed city towered above him. Army gymnastics had made him strong. The daily drill up there under the eaves of Washington had given strength to his arm, and none could do and dare longer than he. Jupiter accompanied the Captain as servant; but I can tell you secretly he was armed. Captain Rushback's pistols hung in his belt, and in the fury of the fight he forgot that he was a negro -or if he remembered that, he remembered also that negroes in America were slaves. Some struggle in his heart, of the latent manhood touched into life by his new position, made the gleaming pistols send their lightning flashes in almost unbroken chains bf fire among the Rebel ranks. Every report (112)   VICTORY.         113 said,in unmistakable language, "Slavery shall die!" The nation had not quite reached the moral plane occupied by the young Captain, who furnished his servant with arms. It was sometime before that anomalous element in our political system was allowed to fight for freedom. Let us not marvel too greatly. As a people we were wellnigh lost to justice-to principle. We had allowed policy to govern us so long,-that mistaken policy which evaded Southern threats of disunion, by giving the monster a mawful of virgin soil to slime over with death, - that it took some severe cannon-shocks to touch the springs of native truth which we trust lie in most Northern hearts. No heart under the army blue beat lighter than Jupiter's when the sound of victory stilled the thun- dering cannon. Somehow he felt that he had helped do the fearful work. He knew he had used the little\ guns faithfully, and if they had failed of execution because they were little, that fact did not take away from the glory of the heroic intent. A Spencer rifle would reach farther, - of that he was aware, - but then he did not even dare to hope that his race would ever be allowed to use the weapon. He was very thankful for the confiscated pistols which once flour- ished in the belt of the Rebel Captain. To one soldier, at least, his accurate use of arms proved that a negro can fire without flinching, or running from the flash of his own shot. Captain Watts said in his heart, "these men should have arms, and then when liberty comes to them, as it surely will, they will feel them- selves helpers in the struggle, and more worthy of freedom because of having done something to gain it. 10*   "4       VICTORY. It will strengthen their manhood to fight. It will give them a chance of overcoming that prejudice of race which is so deep-seated among Americans." Many citizens of Newherne welcomed the blue army. They felt that the rule of Rebellion was not law but lawlessness. All who were suspected of Union sentiments had suffered untold indignities at the hands of the Rebel soldiery. To them the return of the old flag was the coming of order out of chaos. They lost no opportunity of speaking their welcome to our officers and men. And while a majority of the people were defiant or sullen, the Union citizens were in sufficient numbers to soften the cloudy aspect and infuse a little sunlight into the expectant hearts of our vigilant army. Many of our Northern boys expected to find more Union men than Rebels in the captured city. They had believed the people were overawed by tyrannical leaders, and did not realize how the mad wave of secession had swept everything which had not for its foundation the eternal rock of liberty. Others who had more keenly scrutinized the political horizon, were rejoiced to find anything that -bore the semblance of loyalty to the Government of Washing- ton. Every vision of the old flag about the homes of the people filled them with inexpressible joy. Captain Watts, in a solitary stroll about the city, discovered the glorious colors floating from the portico of a house not very pretending in appearance, but all the outer arrangements of which bore marks of a tidy keeper. He stopped to salute the nation's banner, and then stood for several minutes leaning over the neat fence in admiration of the door-yard, with its   VICTORY.         115 shrubs and vines, which looked so like the frugal homes in the quiet villages of New England. He was soon lost in reverie. Any reminder of home, brought tender thoughts to the young soldier. The free North with its frugal industry--its whirr of wheels, and hum of saws, and click of hammers, - and the deso- late South with its auction pens and clanking chains! -stood before him a real picture, which no artist's pencil could touch into harmony. For centuries the tints had been deepening upon- the canvas, ever in contrast with each other. The oil colors of the North- ern painter had been lavishy used to hide the ugly shadow in the foreground, but still the shadow dark- ened with each attempt to cover it from sight. The picture which might have been fairer than Eden, wore forever to the eyes of the true soul, a hideous blot, and none such could look upon it without tears. From over the seas they came to gaze upon it, and ever as they gazed the shadow was denser to their washed sight, than to ours. They saw our high mountains and wide rivers, and sea-like prairies; they heard the noise of our industry as it came up from shop, and field, and factory. The towns and cities which have come fleet-footed to diversify the picture, they looked upon with delight. Our church and college steeples shed the glory of ancient art about the whole, and as they lifted their foreheads to do homage to the artist, a creeping shadow lay at the foot of the canvas, and lo! as they looked, it crept like a vail of black over all. There was a wail in the sound of the loom, and an echo as of haunting ghosts from all the avenues of toil, and traffic, and learning. Yes, the shadow was   "6       VICTOnY. there- we could not hide it from ourselves nor from them. What does the war mean? Shall its fires of shotr and shell burn up the picture we could not retouch into beauty? And then shall we paint harmonious colors upon this providential canvas? At this hopeful period in the Captain's reverie, he lifted his eyes and looked again upon the floating banner. As its silken folds fluttered in the soft spring air, he caught sight of a motto upon it. Drawing nearer he read those immortal words of Jefferson - "All men are created free and equal." He was so inspired by this unlooked-for confession, that he ran up the steps and rapped not very gently upon the door. A lad of perhaps a dozen years opened it for him, and invited the soldier to enter. In the room where he sat down was a lady of middle age, busy with her needle. She gave him cordial welcome, and after he had told her of his surprise and joy at sight of the banner with its divine motto, there followed such an outpouring of long-pent thoughts and feelings, as none ever felt more keenly than the proscribed and per- secuted Unionists of the South. The Captain found his hostess fully awake to the signification of the times. She had long felt that the sin they had hugged in their selfishness, refusing to put it away, would be shaken from them by some providential stroke. She believed that the war meant liberty to the slave. Her clear ideas were to Captain Watts, like a spring in the desert, and nothing but a soldier's duty at his post could have torn him away from so congenial a friend. He accepted gladly an invitation to " come again,"   VICTORY.         117 and hastened to his command, without knowing that the name of "Mrs. Denton ' - which she gave him, had any especial meaning in the like-web he was unconsciously weaving. We think we go about at will. And so we do, perhaps. But a higher will shapes ours, and we go the way He leads us, not knowing we are led. How well -and wisely we are led - we sometimes learn when any necessity turns our feet from the coveted way, and we live to know that way was full of pitfalls, and its end ruin. I X   XI. "6 The years have never dropped their sand On mortal issue vast and grand As ours to-day."' OW   the garrison -at old Fortress Monroe cheered, when the news reached them that Newherne was taken I Their hurras were taken up by the laborers about the Fortress, and passed from lip to lip until the little tent where Bell Winton sat among her eager pupils, rung with the welcome tidings. Doubtful if the cheer had been so resonant had they stopped to consider what this victory meant to them. It would open the way for their faithful teacher, into a more congenial home. A loss,--a deprivation,was the first fruit of the victory. But it had its seed-time, and the language of the sowing was one of hope. Let the victory go on from city to city, through the wide South, and when that land shall feel upon it the hand of Liberty, all her black children shall have teachers. With this thought Bell comforted them when they plead with her not to leave them. "You have a good start now, and can go on by yourselves. There will be plenty of black boys and girls in Newherne whom  I can teach, and so do a greater good." (118)   VICTORY.         119 "O, Miss Bell I we love- you so I " was the voice of every pupil. "We be so sorry when you gone." -"And I shall be sorry too, for you have helped me more than I can ever thank you for--but you know Aunt Mary is in Newherne, and I was told to go to her. If she is not true to the Union cause, I will come back again." "Do come back, Miss Bell." "Would you not rather know that Aunt Mary is true - that she believes you are folks and not cattle, than to have me come back?" "We don't care for Aunt Mary, and we love you- we don't khow nuffin' 'bout her." "I know her," spoke up Dick, "an' she's de most beautifullest missus, 'cept Miss Bell, in de sunny Souf." "Remember my children, that principles are more than persons. That all your future welfare depends upon the maintenance of right principles. If the North with its truth, beats in the battle, you are free. If the South beats, you are still slaves." "Never slaves again," said Rachel, with emphasis. "Better death than that I Go, Miss Winton, -and the Lord grant you find Aunt Mary true." "That is noble. How many of you join Rachel in that?" The heads of the pupils were bowed for awhile. Bell saw that they were slowly evolving the right. After they had thought for a few minutes, Bell re- peated the question, and all assented by rising in- stantly to their feet. Thus she gained their consent and received their united benediction. * E I      120        VI CTOR Yo Bell was truly sorry to leave them. She felt an earnest friendship for Robert and Rachel, and a true interest in all her charge. She was anxious for their uplifting, and impatient of any impediments in the way of the fullest help to this race. But many such impediments still existed, and her hand was only that of a weak woman. She could do something, to be sure, but it seemed so little in view of the vast needs. Of the thousands of contrabands gathered about the Fortress, she had been able to reach but a mere hand- ful with her instructions. That was a discouraging reflection. But then, one soldier could not fight a whole army. Maybe the time would come when there would be some organized effort in this direction,- help adequate to the great needs. So with hope she tried to soothe her impatient spirit, while she made hasty preparations to depart from Fort Monroe. The steamer would leave next morning for New- berne. Bell was taking leave of the kind friends who had helped to make the long months pass so pleasantly away. While she was thanking the officers' wives who had supplied her wardrobe, and telling them of the opulent home she had forsaken, she received a snlmmons to repair to the headquarters of the General Commanding. She tripped lightly along under the escort of officers, thinking she was highly honored in being summoned to an interview with the General before her departure. On arriving, she encountered in the General's room her own father. The first childish impulse was to fall upon his neck with tears and kisses. But the sudden bitter memory of the wrong he had done her, checked   VICTORY.         121 the impulse, and she merely extended her hand, while her face was written all over with terror. "A pretty part you have played, in running away from your father, and living with niggers and Yan- kees." "Father, you know why I left you." "I suppose you did it to gratify some romantic notion of yours. You had no reason for the insane course. Haven't I always been kind and indulgent to you?" "Generally you have. But I have one reason which overbalances all things else. Had you been doubly kind, and still ordered my marriage with Madbury, I would have run away if I had died in the attempt." "O that's the trouble, is it? I suppose you deny any influence from that infernal Yankee prisoner." "I do certainly deny any influence from him. My influences came from entirely different sources.' "From whence?" "From my own sense of right and wrong. I will not marry a man whom I hate." "Did your own sense send you to teaching nig- gers?" "My own awakened sense--yes. I own I had help in rousing that particular portion of my con- science." Damn that Yankee prisoner." "No such. talk as that allowed here, sir. We are Yankee soldiers and will defend our own, whether in battle or prison, sir - so please be -respectful in your terms," said the General. "Father, do not blame the Yankee too severely. He   122        VICTORY. said some things, it is true, which set me thinking. But my especial help came from another source." "Who else has been tampering with my daughter's true Southern ideas? ' "My mother.  "God I Your mother is dead." "But she has spoken to me." "Nonsense I Another Yankee abomination-spirit- ualism, hey?" "No, father. My mother's counsel was written out in her own hand, and sealed, for me to read on ar- riving at suitable age - and I have read it.' The strong man bent his head. One hand crept uneasily among the scattered locks upon his forehead. Bell noticed that the furrows upon his face were deeper than she had ever seen them. Her heart yearned to comfort and help him. O, if she could but unseal his eyes I But she dared not hope for this. They had been blind too long. After awhile he looked up and said - "Bell I have come after you. You must go home with me." "On one condition, father, I will go. Promise me you will break your promise to Madbury." "Impossible. I will not. I cannot. You will never do better. Madbury is rich. Besides I have no. power to retract that promise if I would. You must marry him." "If you still persist in that intention, I shall never see Richmond or home again." "You forget that I am your father, and have the power to take you,whether you will or not." Bell was alarmed. She did not know how her father   VICTORY.         123 learned of her whereabouts. Had any officer at the Fortress betrayed her for the sake of the offered reward? She did not like to think so. Would the General deliver her up after listening to all that had been said between them? "Get ready - we must start." "O, General, will you not save me from this fate which is worse than death I ' cried Bell, as she sank at his feet in an attitude of pleading, - almost despair. "Save you? to be sure I will. Don't kneel to me. I 'don't need any prayers to make me do justice. I have heard enough to know your story, and if that man who calls himself your father thinks he is going to marry you to a man you hate, he will find his mistake." "O, God bless you 1 " gasped Bell, too much over- come to utter more. "Westgate Winton, Esq., it is war time now, and tyranny is being shaken somewhat, whether it finds its victim in black or white. When this, fight is over, there shall be no more forced marriages in the South. Understand, sir, I mean among black men and women, as well as white mene ahd women. Your dominion is crumbling.  Your accursed tyranny is coming to an end. You cannot force your daughter to marry a man she hates while Yankee cannon frown from this For- tress. "Here is a pass, sir, outside our lines. Take it, and thank your stars you get off so well. No cursing-- or I'll put you in the Fortress." Westgate Winton crept off. "Good by, father ' cried Bell,- , and when you come to my terms, I  will come and bless your heart and home all a true daughter can."   124        v i c T O R'Y. There were curses upon his lips; so, as he could not reply otherwise to Bell, he kept silence, fearing no doubt the casemated cells in the frowning Fortress. How had Mr. Winton learned his daughter's where- abouts? Mr. Spencer gathered the facts of her his- tory and presence there, from overhearing the officers talk about the matter. He remembered the reward offered in the Richmond papers, and felt sure he had found the prize. No sooner did he obtain his release than he hastened to Richmond, and seeking out Mr. Winton told him he had found his daughter. He got the reward out of the old man, and sent him on a fool's errand to the Fortress, knowing very well he could not get Bell, after all his pains. But it gratified Mr. Spencer to know that Winton could be cheated out of his child, as well as another had been of his slaves. He was glad to find another as great a fool as himself, to say nothing about the welcome chink of the eagles he clutched in his hand, and the easy way he got them. Bell was not delayed in her passage to Newherne. Favoring breezes bore her to the welcome port, and a warm heart opened to receive her in the home of Aunt Mary. The swaying folds of the stars and stripes which fluttered above her as she entered the open door, sent a thrill of joy and confidence into her long waiting heart. She could find rest where that flag floated, - she felt sure of that. There were no more doubts of Aunt Mary's loyalty. She felt safe and at home. And for a few days she did find glorious rest. Then she looked for work, - the helpful work which she had done at the mouth of the James.   so   - CHA PTE R XTT. "I saw the walls of sea-born Tyre Swept over by the spoiler's fire; And heard the low, expiring moan Of Edom on his rocky throne." occupation of New Orleans by Union forces opened some of the Southern charnel-houses to Northern  inspection.  This city which hugged with its stretching arms the feet of the " father of waters," had not learned humility by its lowly posi- tion. The majestic Mississippi, bearing the floods of the free North, became too murky with the infectious, lowland soil, to wash white the soul of the city. The wealth of the Western farmer floated down to enrich it. His corn, and wheat, and fat of kine, made fat the dealer and the eater. The commerce of other lands added gold to the coffers of this haughty queen. England brought guineas, and loaded her ships with rice and cotton, planted and gathered by unpaid toil. The factories of New England made cloth for her, and shoes for her feet. All manner of merchandise was bought and sold within her sunny borders. She was gayly attired in the silks and laces of the East, and adorned with costly jewels from the heart of the mine, and the depth of the sea. In the pride of her great   126       VICTORY. gain she said, "I sit a queen and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow." Alas, alas, for thee, New Orleans, the cup which you have filled for others shall be bitterly drained by your own lips. God gave you the right to buy and sell corn, and wheat, and rice, and all manner of merchan- dise. But he never gave you the right to buy and sell slaves and the souls of men. Because you have done this and dishonored His image by your unholy traffic, therefore shall your retribution come suddenly as in a moment, and your gain shall be unto you as dust and ashes. Your auction-pens, where men and women and children have been examined like horses, and knocked off to the highest bidder, shall be to you like the smoke of the pit, a precursor of the swift damnation, inseparable from your long-crying sins which at last have reached the ears of outraged justice: The wide-mouthed cannon shall rain fire and brimstone upon you, until your fate shall seem as utterly hopeless as the fate of Sodom, unless you repent. Happily, God's avengers, the soldiers of liberty, found submission in the haughty city before it was utterly destroyed. And -though it may have been only the submission of fear, let us trust that through the stern discipline of the times it may become the submission of hearty penitence; and this city so highly favored for situation may, in the Republic that is to be, become regenerated and redeemed. On one of the auction-blocks of New Orleans, among the gaping, eager crowd of bidders, the chivalrous. Madbury put up the free son he had stolen from Pompey and Dinah Vining.   V ICTORY.         127 There was a look in Sam's eye as he stood there, like that of a lion caged. It said in unmistakable language, to all who have eyes to read, -- "The bars of the cage are about me, but I am a lion still, and God made me free, and if you don't break these bars, He will." His brow was contracted, his lips com- pressed, and his arms- folded tightly across his broad bosom. As his lightning look shot for a -second at Madbury, that " gentleman " felt a slight tremor run over his flesh. But he was quiet again instantly. He remembered the laws of Virginia and Louisiana allowed him to raffic in that species of property- to steal them, if he was sharp enough to do so. At any rate there was no defence in those laws for such as Sam.  He could not appeal to the justice of New  Orleans against the thief who had him in his power. So Madbury smoothed away the slight per- turbation, and listened to the bids. Somehow he felt a little disappointed in the way they ran. "Not high- enough for such a splendid nigger as Sam!" Those who had thus far ventured their gold, saw his look of pride and defiance, and-did not like to offer very high for a  piece of property which promised to be refrac- tory. Madbury began to understand the situation. Sam looked too smart for the market that morning. So stepping up to him, with a flourish of his raw-hide, he hit him a  few cuts about the legs, and commanded him to "lay aside his airs."  The sting of the lash 'only made the eye of the victim fuller of lightning, and sent a  firmer and prouder look over his face. Ile did not cower. He had always been a  free man, and had not leated- the arts by which the slave seeksvto   128        VICTORY. secure a tolerable master, when his fate is suspended upon gold. Madbury saw the effect of his masterly discipline and tried a repetition of the same, accom- panied with very emphatic swearing. Sam stood as statue-like through it all, as though his nerves had been suddenly turned into steel. Just then a new figure came upon the scene, - a tall, lank man, with yellow hair, and swarthy face. His clothes hung loosely about him, and were dirty withal, and from the corners of his mouth a stream of tobacco-juice ran down, and zigzagged through a week's growth of reddish beard. His long, lean hands clutched a rod, something resembling the crook of the Eastern shep- herd, but which on close inspection revealed the fact that the seeming crook was a coil of closely braided raw-hide. He had been watching from the rear of the crowd, the haughty victim standing there for sacrifice, and had concluded that it would afford him agreeable recreation to have the management of that " nigger." "He could bring him to terms. Hadn't he, Orestes Lanker, the name of being the best nigger-tamer in the whole county? He'd bid on the 'fract'ry brute." So Mr. Lanker swayed forward into hearing of the man with the hammer, and bid. He put on a clear hundred higher than anybody else had offered. Mad- bury was not satisfied with this, even, and ordered a call for " higher, higher." But nobody offered higher for that statue of steel, and Mr. Lanker counted out his greasy bills and marched off the " nigger." Fifty miles from the city this representative of his class owned and managed a rice plantation, with its adequate "stock of slaves." There he took Samn,   VICTORY.          129 who knew nothing of such work as fell to his lot, whose life had been passed in comparative ease and comfort, doing no severer task than that of a team- ster. The next morning after his arrival, he was driven afield under the lash of the overseer. His nerves had suffered such severe strain since his capture, and the terrors of his fate had swept over him so fearfully, - that naturally a reaction came, and for a few days he felt little care for himself. He went to work with the hands, and was faithful in his labor, doing the new task as well as a new worker could do it. Mr. Lanker watched vainly for the slightest pretext to indulge in his anticipated recreation. He began to think he had lost something by the bargain, as his principal object had been the pleasure -of "breaking the nigger." Several weeks had gone by, and Sam had showed none of the spirit which looked its defiance on the auction block. Hie seemed abstracted, lost in thought, and therefore meek and obedient to the orders of the overseer. He was dreaming of home and Celia. The dream was one of such serene bliss that the husky rustle of the rice field could not break it. He remem- bered tihe old times, only a little way back, when- he drove his fine horses and earned money each day,- money which had been carefully hoarded for such a divine purpose. This freeman would buy out of slavery the girl he loved. He must earn the gold and buy her, before there could be any safety in their marriage. Ah, he had not dreamed in those beautiful days, that himself, a freeman, would work as a slave in the rice fields of the South. When this thought touched him, he pushed-it away Ad an ugly nightmare,    -130   .    VICTORY. and dreamed on. The field work, so new- and exhaus- tive, served to keep down the fire of his soul, and it smouldered in ashen embers, while he lived afar, and his companions were the beloved of his heart. "A stiddy nigger," said the overseer. "I guess I'll have to cut him a bit, and larn if he's got any sperret." Sam was busy at his work, and busier with his thoughts, when, one day, the overseer rode up to him, and hitting him a few strokes with his lash, ex- claimed- "Be you a dumb nigger, or be you got religion- say?" The shock was too sudden this time. It broke his dream. He sprang upon the overseer like a tiger, and snatching his whip, lashed him furiously. He uttered no word of taunt while he whipped him. When he had inflicted what he thought the overseer's just desert, he went about his work again after with- ing the rawhide about his body. The overseer, in a rage that was terrible, started for the house of the master. His frightened horse had preceded him, and Mr. L. was on the lookout for trouble among the slaves. When he told the almost unheard-of story, Lankel' clapped his hands in glee. Fact is, he had deter- mined to give Sam a " licking," anyhow, but it was better to have some provocation. The provocation had come, quite as strong as he ever anticipated when he saw the 4uction-day fire. The overseer thought Lanker very unfeeling to show so much satisfaction on hearing his agonizing   VICTORY.         131, story, and said so. Lanker apologized bytelling him he was thinking "hov like fury he would lather Sam." This soothed the distress of the overseer, and he went to his quarters and lay down, first en- joining Lanker to call him-when he got ready "to take his revenge on that black brute." Lanker took a large quid of tobacco and sat down to lay his plans. He chewed fast, spit furiously, and rubbed his lean hands at intervals.  "I'll break the 'fract'ry cuss," he muttered between the spirts of tobacco. "He's a likely nigger, and I dont want to spile him, but he's got to be broke in v- spile or not." So Lanker chewed, and muttered, and spit for the rest of the afternoon. He wanted to let Sam finish his day's work, and think he was going to escape vengeance, -  it would be all the more terrible for the hours of waiting. As for Sam, he neither thought nor cared what happened to him. The slaves told him he would be nearly killed for striking the overseer, but he knew that hopeless slavery was death, and said they might kill him if they wanted to. The way out of that house of bondage looked utterly closed; he dared not even hope for liberty again. All1 life's joy had departed from  him-why should he care to live? The slaves wound slowly in from  their places of toil, and ate their simple evening meal. Sam sat down outside the hut with his head upon his hands. The black people, men and women, were silent; all felt the impending terror. Lanker shambled towards them, and approaching Sam, ordered him to strip.   132        VICTOR . Sam did not hear. He was dreaming. The order was 'repeated, accompanied by a few admonitory lashes. Sam dreamed on.  Then two athletic ne- groes were commanded to strip him and tie him to the whipping-post. Lanker began his coveted task. After wielding the lash until his long arms were tired, he stopped to rest them and give his euphoni- ous speech a better chance to take effect. "I say, you black brute, why don't you jump round and holler? It spiles half the fun of lickin' a nigger if he don't holler. Jump, I say I Jump, and holler I I'll make yer holler. Crick, bring the salt." Crick brought the salt, and sprinkled it plentifully in the bleeding gashes. A slight quiver ran over his bleed- ing back, -but Sam did not "jump nor holler." "Here, Crick, you lick awhile. Mebbe you ken lick harder'n me, thinkin' how the black cuss wal- loped you." Crick took the whip. He was a stalwart man, this overseer, and he used his muscles vigorously. He had a personal injury to revenge. He, a white man, of chivalrous ancestry, - albeit a little run out in purse,--he had been struck by this " nigger. ' Wouldn't he have his revenge 1 Fast and furiously fell the blows. Was Sam a bronze statue?  No martyr ever stood more steadily amid devouring flames than he, trander the scorching lashes. In vain Lanker cried continually, "jump and holler, -jump and hol- ler, I say t " he made not a moan, - he changed not his position. Crick got tired and gave the whip to Lanker. By this time "massa" began to fear there was danger   VICTORY.         133 of "spilin' this likely nigger." He stood in a pool of his own blood. He laid up the whip, and called for the hot tar which awaited its taurn among his im- plements of torture, and poured it over the raw and quivering flesh. A faintness came over'the victim, and he would have' fallen to the earth, but for the thongs that bound him. Lanker saw him sink down, and was afraid then he had "spiled him; sure enough. The least fun in lickin' him, too, of any nigger he ever licked." Lanker felt if he had killed him it had not paid in fun. There had been no beg- ging for mercy, - none of those contortions of body, which it seems impossible to avoid when undergoing such awful suffering. This was "a new stripe of nigger " to him. Sam was unbound and carried to the hut, where the slaves did what they could to alleviate his pain. He had been awfully beaten, and his' agony was intense. The safety-valve of a groan would have relieved him a little, but he would not groan. In uncomplaining bitterness of soul he crouched in the hut and passively submitted- to the helpful hands about him. He thought his work-days' were over now. He felt so sick and weak that nothing looked' welcome in the future but death. How he prayed for that certain release from the hand of tyranny. How he longed to go out into that country where "all souls are mine, saith the Lord; " and where he believed his goul would be white as the white man's. But he had a strong body and could not die then. Next morning, after ani utterly sleepless night, he was ordered afield. The sun was hot; a sick faintness 12   134       VICTO R Y. seized him, and he fell by the way. Crick dealt him a blow over the head with the butt of his whip. He did not stir. He struck him again. No motion. Then he kicked him. Passive as a log. "Dead now, sure. And I'm not sorry," he mut- tered. And ordering the slaves to drag' him under a tree and at night bury him, they went on and left poor Sam to his fate. After awhile he revived, and tried to lay some plan of escape from the monsters who had tortured him. lie crept to the margin of the river and lay in the shadow of the underbrush, watching vainly for a sign of relief. Steamers ploughed by in their majesty, laden with wealth for the mart, where slaves were bought and sold, but he could hope for help from none of them. If he lay like a waif upon the waters under their very keels they would take him on board only to restore him to the brute who had nearly murdered him. O, if some vessel going North--towards the land of liberty -could but bear him safely there I But where is the land of-liberty? States calling them- selves free, and whose feet are washed by the free Mississippi, will not allow a black man within their borders. He may not even earn his daily bread, in toil upon their stretching prairies. "This is the white man's country," and you have no business with its blessings. True we stole you, O child of Ham, and brought you here, but we stole you for,a servant, that we might scourge you into obedience if you failed to be submissive. There is nothing left for you but to submit to your fate. You must bear stripes. There is no help.

His help shall be certain! - He delayeth not his coming. And so Sam lay hopeless in the shadow, until they who had thought him dead, missing him from the tree where they had dragged him, hunted and found him and bore him to their narrow quarters. The overseer had sent them to " bury the' dead nigger" - and this gave him a chance-for his life. The slaves kept him secreted in their huts and washed his wounds; and poor Lanker mourned the loss of his money, which had been the same as thrown away, as it brought him no A" fun " in the spending. When Sam was fully well, he made his escape from the place of his torment and found his way to New Orleans. Here he sought a home among some of the free colored people and soon made himself useful as coachman to a man who had been mysteriously de- prived of the slave who served him in that capacity.   --CHAPTER--i XIII. "For the sighing of the poor And for the needy, God hath risen, And chains are breaking." ADBURY pursuing his nefarious business- his traffic in human souls--saw Sam driving the coach of the rich Barclay through the streets of the city. He could not be mistaken -it was surely Sam. Lucky fellow, he thought, to change the work of a rice plantation for the genteel position of coach- man. He felt eager to know how it had come about. So he sought an interview with Barclay, to whom he had once been introduced at the St. Charles. "How much did you pay for that nigger, sir, that drives for ye?" "He is a free negro, Mr. Madbury. I had the misfortune to lose my coachman, and learning acci- dentally of Sam, I thought I would employ himmuntil- opportunity offered to make another purchase. And really he is such a superior coachman, I don't know but I shall give up buying, and keep him if he is will- ing to stay." "Barclay, you've been fooled. I brought that very nigger here with a lot from Virginny, and sold him myself." (136)   VICTORY.         137 "To whom did you sell him? There has never been any call for him, and there certainly would have been had he escaped from his master." "I sold him to one Lanker, a, rice planter up the river about fifty miles. I always keep an account of my business transactions. I have a memorandum of the whole affair," "It is very singular that he has not tried to recover him; he is an exceedingly fine black." "Are you sure he has never been advertised? ' Quite sure, Mr. Madbury. My interest in slavef property leads me to look carefully after these advertise- ments, and there has never been anything about Sam."' "There's some foul play somewhere. Somebody's been fooled, and I'm the man that's going to know about it." . "I think you will find it all right. He may have purchased his freedom, -he is very smart." "That's impossible. It's but two years since I brought him from Virginny. I'd like to see the lazy nigger that could earn his freedom in two years." "I don't understand the matter, Mr. Madbury, but I feel quite sure it is all Fight on Sam'S part. He has conducted himself finely with me." "How long did I understand you've had him?" "That matter has not been spoken of--but I havr no objections to telling you; as near as I can recall, it is about a year and a half." "Wal, sir, I'm certain somebody's been fooled. It can't be you, as you have no investment in the nigger." Madbury bowed himself out, and took a bee-line to the river. He went on board the first craft upward 12*   138       V I C T ORY. bound, and was set ashore at the Lanker plantation. That lean gentleman was refreshing his hungry condi- tion at the supper-table when the rich and chivalrous Madbury was announced. He was immediately invited to share the hospitality of the house, and proceeded at once to the supper-room. A portly woman sat at the head of the table and did the honors. "Miss Lanker, I suppose," said Madbury, as that gentleman did not introduce any one at the table. "Yes, yes. That is--she takes Miss Lanker's place now. She died with the fever last year." "And these are your children-- a fine, interesting family, Lanker." "Yes, these is my children; a pretty fine, intel- lectual lot, sir." And Madbury made very courteous obeisance to the dark woman, and the tow-headed children. There was whiskey upon the table, and the tongues of the two got very limber. "How's niggers, now? You're still in the business, I 'spose."  "Well -yes.   But I'm  gradually getting out. You see the war has played the devil with 'em. They're precar'us property, I tell ye, Lanker; I only buy nice lots, and they play me all sorts of tricks- they've grown so mighty, lately." "That was a gritty brute you sold to me." "Ah, didn't he work well? He had not been used to plantation work, but he was strong and likely, wasn't he?" "Gritty, but couldn't stand it. My overseer licked him one day, and next mornin' he was found dead under a tree."   VI CTORY.       -  39 "Dead! Is that so? Are you sure he was dead?" "Yes, dead and buried. My niggers buried him under the same tree." "Astonishing I saw a nigger in New Orleans, that I wouldn't be afraid to bet all I'm worth, was Sam Vining." "You did I Then he must have riz from the dead. He acted very singular all the time he was here." "Nonsense I No danger of a nigger rising from the dead. You've been fooled. He shammed dead, and then run away." "Wal, Madbury, if what you're sayin' is true, its good as a clean thousan' in my pocket. But he must be dead. I'm sure my niggers buried him." After supper the "gentlemen" visited the spot where- Sam was supposed to have been buried. The slaves were called to add their testimony to the fact of his interment, which they did in a most emphatic manner. "'We'se put him in wid des berry han's, massa, and trow de dirt on, and heap it up." "You see, Madbury, he was buried." "Nonsense. I'll believe it when I see his bones. If you've no objections, Lanker, I should like to have the grave opened." "Get your spades, niggers, and dig away. Certain, I haint no objections." The negroes brought their spades and began to dig. It was slow work and the " gentlemen" thought they would walk awhile and come round to the spot after the necessary excavation had been made. Sambo was not in fear of discovery to his strategem. Ttfere was a body in the grave -that of an old negro, who died   "O       VI CTORY. "soon after Sam's disappearance. They dug until the body was partially revealed, and then waited for the "massas' ' return. Madbury and Lanker came and looked in. They were satisfied. There was certainly somebody buried there, and neither of them cared to come in nearer contact with Old Mortality than they were, standing by the grave's brink and looking in. They had too many sins stalking like ghosts through their coward consciences to dare to meddle with dead men's bones. "It's very singular. But, Lanker, you must go with me to the city and see that nigger. If it is not Sam, it's his exact image." "' A nigger can't rise from the dead, and stay in his grave both to once, can he?" "I confess I know very little about rising from the dead. I've always managed my affairs with reference to this world of flesh and bones, and don't believe in any other. Will you go with me in the morning?" "Yes, I've no objections to goin', but it's a leetle scary.' Lanker had just seen an open grave, and he knew that he had whipped Sam hard enough to kill him,. No wonder he felt a little scary. Some of his slaves were pious, and he had heard them sing and talk about another world. He had some vague and shadowy notions about it which were not calculated to promote quietness of soul at any time; more especially now when the voice of a murdered victim seemed crying to him from the ground. In the morning, the " gentlemen " set out for New   VICTORY.          141 *Orleans. After their arrival, they did not wait long before calling at the mansion of 'Mr. Barclay. That gentleman was taking an airing with his family, and they were obliged to repeat their call, which they made sufficient inquiries to do, when the host was at home. Madbury related the marvellous circumstances con- cerning Sam. Mr. Barclay was wise enough to know that there  had been some pretty sharp negro trick in the matter to so deceive Lanker, and inquired if there were any marks upon Sam by which he would know him. Lanker knew of no others, but the marks of the ter- rible thrashing he had given him. Whether he could identify the negro by these, was a question. -Such scars were not at all uncommon. Madbury wanted the negro called and exami ned. Sam came into their august presence. As his eye fell upon the two, the old statue look came over him, and he seemed on fire with some terrible memory. They knew the look- couldn't deceive them in that. Both of them had seen it on the auction-block. One of them had seen it at the martyr's stake. Somebody else was buried in that grave. This was the real Sam, and no counterfeit. "Do you know these men?" said Mr. Barclay. "Yes, massa."  .. "Who are they?" "Shall I tell you the truth, massa?" "Certainly. Always truth, Sam." "That one is Madbury, who stole me, a free team- ster, from Richmond - " "Stop your lies I Stole you? Say that again, and you're a dead nigger."   "2       VICTORY. "And that one is Lanker, who bought me and whipped me almost to death." "Yes, whipped you cussed hard, Sam. . Show your scars." Sam uncovered his back. Lanker looked at the seams  so did the others. "A 'fract'ry nigger, Barclay. Wallopped the over- seer - must keep 'em straight, or you can't do nothin' on a big plantation like mine." "Lanker, you seem to have established your claim to Sam--how much will you sell him for? Very likely he will escape again, if you take him back, and you might not find him a second time." Lanker thought there might be some truth in what Mr. Barclay said, though he could not quite allow the vengeance which was rankling in his heart to exchange its victim for money. He was weighing the matter and could not decide to set a price. Barclay offered him two thousand dollars. It was large; a great temptation. But where would Sam get pun- ished for cheating him so wofully. Barclay evidently liked the "nigger."  Southern discipline must be maintained. PI'll tell ye what I'll do. If you'll let me wallop him for running away, it's a bargain." "I cannot allow that," said Barclay. I want the property in good condition or not at all." "O it wouldn't hender him from drivin' horses, though I should lick hard." "Yes, the scars he already has, prove that," said Barclay, with some show of indignation. "Well, sir. Then I've nothin' to do but to take my nigger and be off."   VICTORY.         143 "Do buy me, massa Barclay. I'll take the lickin' rather than go with him." "No you wont; you'll go with me now, and the lickin's you'll get can't be counted." "Sam,you may see to the horses, while I talk awhile with the gentlemen," said Mr. Barclay. "Sam, you're mine. You needn't mind him. Stop ' there where I can see ye." "' I certainly hope you will not object to his leaving the room a few minutes. I have some things to say, which I prefer he should not hear." "If you'll jest tie him out there, I've no objections." Mr. Barclay took a stout rope and tied his hands together to a post of the piazza. Lanker examined the knot, and was satisfied. "Now, gentlemen, we will have wine before we talk farther," said the host, and .ringing the bell the waiter made his appearance. Mr. Barclay ordered the wine, and the waiter disappeared to get it. "See here, Willie," said Mr. Barclay, and fearing he might not hear him, he stepped into the passage, and in a voice which the " gentlemen" distinctly heard, ordered old Madeira from a certain shelf in the cellar. He returned in an instant, and none but Sam knew that his errand had any other than its pretended meaning. The wine passed freely, and Mr. Barclay's guests evinced a capacity for understanding the qual- ities of good wine as well as a " prime article of nigger." After they had become joyfully garrulous he renewed his offer for the young coachman. He expatiated upon his capacity for that kind of employ- ment, and spoke wisely-and well on the injudicious   "4       VI CTORY. attempt to make a common field-hand of as bright a fellow as Sam--said he would be always running away and causing trouble, and might be the means of introducing discontent onto the plantation. "Can't give up the lickin' part. Allow that and I'll take the two thousand." "I never like to see a negro whipped for nothing; it is bad enough to punish them when they deserve it." 'I Don't you call it deserving it when one runs away, and cheats his master out of a year-and-a-half's work?" "The price I offer you, pays you for the loss of labor, and if I should allow him to be whipped, it would look as though I was lacking in money, and compromised on the price, by admitting a whipping into the bargain. How much shall I pay you, and you give up this notion of whipping?  "No money can buy me out of that. I'm bent on the lickin', or I take the nigger." "Is that a finality, Mr. Lanker?" "Wal, no. I'll promis' not to kill him. If I do, of course I've no claim to your money." "This is a hard case." "Why, Barclay, one would think you an abolition- ist. It's a disgrace to a Southern gentleman to be squeamish about licking a nigger." "Madbury, you came from Virginia, where the war is felt and understood as it is not here. Will it not be likely to shake us a little in the slavery matter?" "Shake us? Why I suppose niggers will fall some while the war lasts, but we shall whip the Yankees so they'll never dare speak again, and then slavery will be established on a sure foundation."   VICTORY.         145 "If we do, it will, of course. But there is contin- gency in all undertakings, and under the circumstances I have concluded we had better treat our negroes a little better than we have. It is safest so - or would be, should the abolitionists get the better of us in the fight." "Well, as for me, I'm not going to get tender towards my cattle yet awhile. We licked at Bull Run, and we shall lick every time. One Southern man can lick five Yankees," "Take another glass, Mr. Lanker." Mr. Lanker took another glass, then he rose to his feet and announced his purpose to take the " nigger? and depart. "I really need him. I don't know where I can find another coachman; here, take his price, Lanker, and whip him if you must." Lanker grinned and rubbed his hands while Barclay counted out the money, then pocketing it went into the hall for his shepherd's crook. "You must excuse-me from witnessing the scene," said Barclay. "I like Sam, and cannot see hi-m whipped." Madbury thought he should relish the spectacle, and the two proceeded to the piazza. Presently a roar of curses reached the ear of Mr. Barclay, and Madbury and Lanker rushed in exclaim- ing that Sam was gone, rope and all. Lanker said he had taken the post away --but the piazza posts were a little mixed up to him. It was not often he got his fill of old Madeira. 13   "6       VICTORY. Mr. Barclay went out to look. Sure enough Sam was gone. "Your niggers have helped him off," exclaimed Lanker in rage. a1 My negroes are perfectly respectful and obedient. Not one of them will in any way cross my wishes." "Well, he never got away without help." "Is it any more mysterious than his disappearance from your plantation?" "I believe he's the very devil. I'm glad you lost him, and not me." "If the negro is gone, I think I shall recall the two thousand. He ran away from you, not from me." "Get the money if ye can," said Lanker, and with- out farther ceremony he was making tracks as fast as the fleetest runaway. Mr. Barclay cried after him, that he should instantly send an officer of the law to arrest him. Lanker only ran the faster, and Madbury tried to keep up with his long reaches. When they were gone, Barclay took a hearty laugh 'at thought of the discomfited Lanker, and putting on his hat walked to the house of the free negroes, where Sam had first found a home in New Orleans. "Well, my good fellow, that lean rice raiser didn't "Iick " you, nor get you either; you are mine, and I want you to feel just as free as you did before I paid two thousand dollars for your ransom." "O God bless you, massa I " exclaimed the rejoicing negro. "Row I'm happy--most as happy as I was in old Virginny." "You never told me Madbury stole you."   V . CTORY.        147 "I was afraid to, massa." "Don't fear me any more, will you?" "No, massa ;" and as the two walked home side by side, Sam told him of Pompey and Dinah, and how he was earning money to buy Celia when he was stolen. "I need you, Sam, but if you 'would like to go North, you shall start to-morrow.' "Do you think Sam can be ungrateful, massa? No. I will stay with you." Barclay was the finest type of a Southern slave- owner. Hie had a generous heart and noble impulses which had rebelled more than once when he mused upon the unnatural condition of the black man. But he was only a single man, and the current was -strong. What use to try to stem it. So he drifted with it, and made the best of the matter by considerate treatment of all his slaves. He had entertained some thought of giving each his freedom, but lately the momentous subject of the war had engrossed him to the exclusion of other thoughts. And so the days slipped away, till suddenly Mr. Barclay slipped out of life, and not a single slave had been manumitted. Sam asserted the fact of his freedom, and the kindness with which his late master had treated him. But it did no good. There was no one among the heirs of Mr. Barclay who had anything of his spirit. Southern notions of ownership in man held high carnival in what little minds they possessed, and these notions were touched into intensity by the terrible venture of secession, and the mad spirit of the hour. The great estate was embarrassed and the slaves   "8       VICTORY. must be sold. Mr. Barclay had been easy in his affairs, and sharpers had overreached him. Sam was in terror at the uncertain fate which brooded over him. He thought of Mr. Barclay's offer to send him North, and almost wished he had accepted it. But instantly he put it away as an ungrateful thought, and rejoiced that he had served the man who saved him from the infamous Lanker. "I cannot fall into worse hands than his, who whipped me so unmercifully - I will bide my time." And so, hoping and fearing, he waited the sale. Lanker sitting with his quid, over the advertising columns of the Picayune, began to spit with unusual velocity, as his hungry eye took in the meaning of what he read. Presently he dropped the paper -and rubbed his hlands, while the wide grin upon his visage allowed easy avenues for the tobacco without the par- tially intellectual effort of spitting. "I've got him now," he muttered, ' and the lickin' aint sp'ilt by keepin'.' "Here, Cindy, I'm goin' immediately to the city, take these keys and things, and hand 'em to Crick, I must start now to be there in time. Le's see, what's the day?  It's to-morrow, true's my name's Lanker. Good by, Cindy," and Cindy showed the whites of her eyes, and sent back an answering grin to the lux- urious kiss graciously bestowed as "Massa Lanker's " parting benediction. She thought as he shambled off, that something had made him uncommon good natured. She generally got more kicks than kisses, notwith- standing she took "Miss Lanker's place." Sam standing a second time upon the auction-block   VICTORY.         149 in New Orleans, and calming the fire of his soul, by an attitude of indifference, suddenly felt every fibre of his frame stirred, as his eye caught among the gaping crowd, the lean face of the detestable Lanker. He knew why he had come to the auction ; and looked upon himself as a victim as surely when he saw his face among the bidders, as when he was marched away before the coiled lash of the insatiate negro whipper. Thoughts of self-destruction came over him. A' He would jump overboard. He would not submit to such tyranny." Then something he had heard in whispers about the city, gave him hope. "The soldiers of the Union, army were coming;" so it was said. The banner they bore meant Liberty. It had always meant that, and yet the black man had been a slave. But somehow, by that unaccountable intuition which educates the negro above our expectation, Sam believed the war would help his race. He would endure a little longer. So he watched the spires of the receding city and wondered what God thought of them. Men knelt beneath them and mumbled prayers on Sunday who coined human souls into gold the week long- and tortured them too, while they toiled for their good. His introduction, on his arrival at the rice swamp, was a flogging, second only in intensity to the one he had received there before. "And this is the way I break 'fract'ry niggers, and take vengeance on runaways, said Lanker," when he had finished the little recreation. It' was only the beginning of a series of tortures which a fiend could hardly have made more terrible. He was whipped time after time without the least provocation, save a   150        VICTORY. failure to accomplish the impossible tasks laid upon him. He was gagged. He was hung up by his arms. He was buried with his head exposed to the sun, and vermin of the soil. He was imprisoned and fed upon less and worse than the heroes and martyrs of Ander- sonville. So his tortures succeeded each other in, terror and intensity, and so he suffered, continually watched so that escape was impossible, when the guns of the Union fleet shook the Mississippi more than fifty miles up from the Gulf. They shook Lanker. He thought the day of doom had come. He had bet largely and sworn furiously, that old Farragut could never take the great and strong city of New Orleans. He could never pass the Forts. He had seen St. Phillip himself, and knew that no Yankee gun or gun- boat could make the " stars and bars " of the Confed- eracy come down from her ramparts. Fort St. Phillip and Fort Jackson had surrendered, and the blue-coats were in the heart of the city, and Lanker imagined he heard the tramp of their soldierly feet after him; and he fled in terror farther inland. Ah, there are feet of justice after you, O monster, and terrible shall be your retribution when once you are overtaken       ' The slaves did not run inland. Those who ran at all followed the course of the river to New Orleans. Sam was not slow in making his escape sure when the lynx eyes of Lanker disappeared. Under the wise rule of General Butler, he found protection, and was glad he had not died before he saw the soldiers and the flag of freedom.   CHAPTER XIV. "We start' to think that hapless race Must shape'our good or ill." tELL WINTON coming in from her contraband school, one afternoon, went as usual to her own room for a few moments of rest and quiet thought. She had scarcely laid aside her hat and gloves, when a gentle rap was heard at her door, and on opening it Aunt Mary's pleasant face looked in. "Are you very tired, dear?" "Not very- but O, there is so much to do, and so few hands for the work!" "That is true; but my little girl must not kill her- self trying to do it all. Take care of your strength, child, so that you can live and work another day." "How can I take care of myself when the demands are so great? I don't think of myself until I reach my own room, and then, as soon as I am rested a minute, my head is busy with plans for the further- ance of my work." "I came to invite you into the parlor. I have a caller, an officer of the Federal army. He is very (151)   152       VICTORY. interesting in conversation, and I thought it might brighten you up to hear him talk. "I am too tired, aunty." "I thought you were not very tired. You said so a moment ago." "Well, not very, to be sure. But I am too tired to dress." "Go down as you are. Soldiers are not fastid- ious.'" "O, aunty I I'll warrant he brightened his buttons before coming, and I couldn't think of being intro- duced to an officer in a calico dress." "These are war times. And if the toils they bring make us too sad or weary to put on the gay attire of other days, surely our fellow-workers iq the same cause will honor us for the plain apparel." "Glorious, auntyl JTnm right down stairs and I will follow you in five minutes. I'm not a bit tired. Your inspiration has given me a new set of nerves.;' Mrs. Denton returned to the parlor, .and in- formed her guest that a niece of hers, a teacher in the contraband school, was stopping at her house, and she had invited her to come down stairs. "She is a thorough abolitionist, but sometimes gets almost discouraged in her work because of the limited number of helpers in the great field. I thought it would strengthen her to hear the senti- ments entertained by a representative of the Govern- ment army; she has very little opportunity for inter- change of thought, being an utter stranger except to the members of my own family." Aunt Mary had but just finished her explanatory   I       -      VICTORY.          153 introduction, when the light step of her niece was heard in the hall. The Captain straightened up a little, and it must be confessed he ran his fingers through his hair, and smoothed his beard. Mrs. Denton rose to meet Bell at the door, and make them formally acquainted. - What was the mat- ter? For a moment she thought her niece had grown suddenly crazy. She darted past Aunt Mary with the fleetness of a fawn, and extending her hands they were clasped by the soldier in blue. Neither of them had spoken, and Mrs. Denton stood in utter astonish- 'ment at the spectacle. The Captain was terribly "surprised,' and the arms which he needed just then he thought were utterly lost. At length by a super- human effort, he found his speeche "Is it possible I meet Miss Wihton here, and under such circumstances?" and turning to Mrs. Denton, he said, "I look upon your niece as the saviour of my life." "Yes, aunty," said Bell, who by this time had found her voice, " this is the Yankee I nursed in the Richmond Hospital. I., know him by his eyes and hair; his face then was thin and white."' Mrs. Denton began to understand. On the whole she thought the greeting not too cordial. Bell of course felt overjoyed to see the soldier restored to health and liberty, whom she had left confined to his hospital couch, under the shadow of frowning Libby prison. And the Captain would feel a sense of grati- tude to the woman who saved his life, and naturally express that gratitude on meeting her, no matter what the-circumstances. The young and fresh hearted are   154       VICTORY. impulsive in the expression of their sentiments. They' do not weigh and measure word and act as they may afterwards, when the conventionalities of the world have entrapped them in a less real life. So Aunt Mary reasoned, and did not feel that it-was anything out of the way for the two to clasp hands. I think if there had been kisses, she would have excused them as well. Soon the three sat down, and the question, "How did you escape?" furnished a subject for the Cap- tain's ready speech, and an explanation of his shoul- der-straps. The women listened with intense interest to the story he told them, and when he was about to depart, Bell inquired if Jupiter could read. "Yes, Miss Winton. I have taught him to read and write. He learned like magic. I did not learn so quickly." Aunt Mary began to think that there was some other attraction than the motto on the banner over her door, or even her own loyal self; the Captain came very often to the house now-a-days, much oftener than he used to. No doubt he felt very grate- ful to Bell for saving his life, and tried to make her home in Newherne pleasant for her.- Sometimes Aunt Mary would see them coming together from the direction of the contraband school, walking slowly and talking earnestly. She knew how deeply Bell felt for the race she was trying to help, and had no doubt their conversation was concerning means and methods for the furtherance of education among the ignorant people of the South. They thought alike on these absorbing questions, and it was quite natural   VIC TORY.         155 they should meet often to talk about them. They certainly did talk about the war and its vast interests, -the upheaval and commotion which it had brought to the unstable South,- and the hopes which were rising, newly winged, from the brooding desolation of loss and defeat to an unholy cause. These are fitting themes for a soldier and a teacher of contrabands. Had Captain Watts and Miss Win- ton been walking under New England elms, in the glorious days of peace, or had they sat down together under the porch wreathed with honeysuckle, instead of the Nation's banner, in the absence of duty they might have given voice to desire. They were flesh- and-blood people, and both of them had hearts. More than this, each was thoroughly aware that the other was very charming, and wise, and noble. There was plenty of admirable material for the very finest of lovers' talk, with kisses to mark the pauses. But this man and maiden of whom I write, were cast upon troublous times. The bugle-call of duty in a most tremendous crisis, had touched their hearts and quickened their ready hands. They had consecrated themselves unreservedly to the needs of their stricken country. They felt that in such an hour love. should take on its divinest form, and do its holiest work. Self-seeking and personal pleasure have no part in times like these. This is the evening hour of sacri- fice; home and domestic joys must be laid aside until our offering is accepted, and the smoke has cleared away. Love in its angelic, better say its Christlike, form of self-surrender and personal consecration, was the love to which they gave expression. To strengthen    156       VICTORY. and build each other in heroism for the stern reali- ties of peril, was the object and fruit of their frequent communion. There was rare joy in these hours of communion; that joy which flows like nectar when two souls strike no discordant notes in touching the' keys of life. Both had been stirred by the sound of arms, and deeps of being had been fathomed which no days of peace could ever have revealed. They felt a capacity for the noblest joys, heightened and intensified by the presence of danger and need. You can understand this, my friend, - you who have wept tears of blood over the terrors of the time, and through it all have worn in your breast, a heart of loyal consecration. Those spring and early summer days were deli- cious. A little too quiescent for the Captain, per- haps, with only an occasional inland expedition, al- most fi'uitless of lasting results; but to Bell, in the midst of her work, with a friend for counsellor when she needed counsel, they went by on wings. They had rejoiced together over the victories on the Mississippi, crowned by the taking of New Or- leans, and now they were watching with intensest in. terest the movements of McClellan on the Peninsula. Bell thought an army so large and finely equipped, could not fail of making permanent lodgement in her native city. She often pictured to herself her old home protected again by the "stars and stripes," and wondered if any change would be wrought in her father's ways of thinking, on the reappearance of the old banner. The Captain also thought the army large enough and heroic enough, for the capture of the   VICGTORY. -        157 Rebel Capital. But as he watched its weary waiting in the trenches of Yorktown, and the -swamps and thickets of the Chickahominy, he grew faint-hearted with apprehensions of coming disaster. "There is something wrong somewhere, Bell. Have you seen this account of the battle of Williams- burg, fought mainly by Hooker's division, and Gen- eral McClellan's order for the whole army to rest four days after the battle? Why did he not press the re- treating Rebels? The army was not weary. But a small proportion of it had been in the fight. I con- fess this looks a little singular to me. I know it is a glorious thing for a General to be careful of his men; but it is better to take care of the cause he is appoint- ed to defend. The principles at stake are of more consequence to the world than all our little lives. Republican institutions are being tried as by fire. If we fail in this contest, the world goes backward a thousand years. I am afraid McClellan's heart is not in the cause." "Let us wait a little longer, Captain, before we judge him. We may not know all the circumstances of the case, as he does, there upon-the field. His de- spatches are' beautiful, and his orders to his soldiers really Napoleonic." "I know they sound well, but there is not back- bone enough about them to suit me. I had almost said they are 'like sounding brass;' but we will not judge any farther than facts justify us in doing. I have just had a letter from a friend, an officer in his army. I will read you a portion of it." "We are lying in the swamps of the Chickahominy, "   158        VIOT oP, Y. and for no earthly reason but because we lack a leader. We might have been in Richmond a month ago, if our commander had allowed us to go there. There is no force in our front which could withstand a concentrated and well-directed. movement. But there has been no concentration, no concert of action. We have fought bloody battles, and generally against fearful odds, because of the unfortunate disposition of our forces. Our men are dying here in this pestilen- tial place at the rate of fifteen hundred a day. In a little while the splendid army of the Potomac will have melted into thin air. I tell you, Watts, I be- lieve George B. McClellan' is as much a traitor as Robert Lee." ".This is terrible -" exclaimed Bell. "Not your friend's judgment, but the fear that it may prove true. What will become of us if he is a traitor?" "We have other generals who can be trusted." "But the wasted army!  The noble boys who have wives, and sisters, and mothers to mourn their sudden fall, -it is terrible to think of life thus thrown away." "I know. But there are other boys scattered over the North and West ready to come at a call, and close up the broken ranks and fight for the victory; The waiting is hard to endure, but we shall conquer at last, though whole armies perish." "I am glad you are not discouraged by your fears." "On the contrary, I am strengthened by them. If I fear defection in high places, I shall become person- ally only the more closely wedded to the holy cause, and determined to do my individual duty at whatever hazards. But I must be at my post. Good night."   VICTORY.         159 When Captain Watts next called upon Miss Winton, his grave apprehensions had been substantiated by subsequent events. McClellan had retreated to Har- rison's Landing. O Harrison I memorable for martial renown, did you see him come? Did you see the dis- heartened men as they crept to the banks of the James not knowing why retreat had been ordered? Did you set the Generals, and the Colonels, and the Captains, chafing with anger, and their faces written over with shame and irrepressible tears? Did you hear the magnificent address of the Commander, full of high- sounding phrases as of victory instead of retreat? If you did, I think there must be tears in heaven. The heart of the whole loyal people beat faint and low at this failure. They had gathered about the young Napoleon. They had written him a hero, and for months had waited in silent patience expecting he would prove himself entitled to the name. But with all martial equipments--with horses and men and chariots of war, he had sat for weeks by the gates of the Rebel Capital, with the power to open them at will; he had sat and waited, and at last had led his army to the banks of the James -to await reinforce- ments. He retreated before "superior numbers" so he says, and yet in Pollard's history of the Rebellion, I read this :- "When the army of General McClellan retreated to Harrison's Landing we could no longer molest them, having no army to do it with." "We, are   going Bell--to reinforce McClellan. There is bitter work, but I am ready for it. Maybe we can redeem the time. Good by. I am stronger   160        VICTORY. for the hours we have passed together, and remember, -let the future hold what it will for us, I owe you my life. A life consecrated to country, which you saved for further service, did you not? ' "Yes. Go. And may the Lord bless the blows you strike, and give us the victory." There were no lingering adieus. The two clasped hands in silence, and then parted-he to face the wide-mouthed cannon --she to evade,if possible, the shot of Governor Stanley, and continue, if need be by stealth, her beneficent mission. She felt something of Fanny Kemble's resolute will, at any restrictions upon her work, and determined to pursue it though a mountain of human edicts should stand in the way. After each was alone with his own soul and God, I think the picture of a home among the green valleys of the North, looked for a moment into their yearning hearts. They two should be priest and priestess at its altar. Plenty and honor and content should abide in their tabernacle-liberty-and peace descend upon it in serene benediction. But the war,with its trenches of nameless dead, lay between '" now " and " then," and each put the sweet picture safely away, where it could not disturb the stern path of loyal duty, with its winning look. The young Captain was missed in the home of Aunt Mary. He was missed among the contrabands of Newherne.  He  was missed  Yes, Bell Wintori missed him - but she only buckled more tightly her armor of endeavor. She did not pine, nor shed regret- ful tears.   1    -  -APTER XV. nc Through this dark and stormy night, Faith beholds a feeble light, Up the blackness streaking." "I WANT troops and guns. If you do not send them I cannot hold my position half an hour." "Tell General Burnside this is the battle of the war. He must hold his ground-till dark, at any cost." And General McClellan looked down into the valley where Fitz John Porter's fifteen thousand fresh men displayed their steely columns. He looked and shook his head; "They are the only reserves of the army; they cannot be spared." So General Burnside fought against pressing odds - fought and fell slowly back from the fine position he had gained--back to the bridge. He need not have fallen back if Porter's reserves had been used for anything but a body-guard for a General who was afraid to die. In the fierce and hotly contested fight, Captain Watts found himself leading the remnant of his regi- ment, which had suffered severely in officers and men. His Colonel had fallen, mortally wounded; and while others hesitated in fear of the terrible carnage, he instantly'assumed command and led his men up the- (161)   162       VICT TO Y. hill. As they were fighting their way up its grassy sides, and friend and foe were falling like the leaves of the later autumn, a Rebel Colonel, who had fallen wounded, was observed by Jupiter to be taking aim at the head of the Captain as he pressed'on. Jupiter put the muzzle of his splendid revolver in the Rebel's face, and told him to " drop that weapon or die in less than no timel "  The sudden apparition of a black man, or the fear of death and the eternities made the Rebel drop his pistol. "Let me see; I think I have seen you somewhere. Guess I will take you to the rear where we can have a little private conversation.', And suiting the action to the word, Jupiter took the Rebel Colonel to a safe distance in the rear. Captain Watts missed his faithful servant and com- panion in battle, and feared he had fallen. As the forces of General Burnside fell back from the field they had so heroically won, the Captain scanned the path of their retreat as well as he could in the midst of the smoke and carnage, but he saw no Jupiter among the dead. He felt sure the faithful fellow had not been frightened by the roar of the guns. He had heard them before. He must be dead or wounded. Perhaps wounded and carried to the rear. When the shadows of evening whispered peace 'to the contending hosts, Captain Watts looked among the groups of wounded men. Presently he saw Jupi- ter standing erect in a most soldierly attitude, appar- ently on guard. Approaching  him he observed a Rebel Colonel lying on the grass at his feet. "Jupiter, I missed you in the fight and feared you were killed or wounded."   VICTORY.         163 "No, Captain, I have taken a prisoner. That is why I left the field." "That is splendid, Jupiter I You'll have to be promoted." "I am promoted in being allowed to catch this Rebel. I' know him, Captain. I've seen him before this day." "You have seen him, Jupiter; who is he?" "I have been ordering his leg done up, and giving him refreshments so as to have a little private conver- sation with him. I thought I would reserve the talk until your return from- the field of battle. Now Cap- tain, you just sit down on the grass there, and listen to the questions I'm about to propound." Captain Watts sat down on the grass, not a little curious to know when and where Jupiter had seen the Rebel Colonel. It was 'not his old master Rushback, released from prison and in the field again. He dis- tinctly remembered that man's. look. Jupiter pro- ceeded with his questions, and the Captain listened with profound interest. "What did you do with my wife Eliza?" "None of your business! you black "-- "See here, sir. Do you see this? Now just re- member the proper position of a prisoner, if you please," and Jupiter showed him his pistol, which had been carefully loaded. "Answer the question, sir I "I sold her in New Orleans; much good it will do you to know it." "Tell me the name of the man you sold her to?" and Jupiter handed the Captain a pencil, saying,   164       VICTORYS "Please, Captain, keep this record for me I Guess there's enough daylight for you to see." "No Waiting, sir." "What good will it do you to know? you will never get her again." "That is nothing to the case. Answer these ques- tions; and no more words than necessary, or I'll kill you, as sure as there's a pistol in this right hand?" Jupiter looked the words he uttered, and the Rebel understood him. "I sold her to Johnston Rynders." "Do you know what he wanted her for?" "Well, she was what we call in New Orleans a' ' fancy article.' " "I understand!" said Jupiter, with a look in which rage, and agony, and vengeance were mingled. "I will shoot the villain-! He shall die I " ex- claimed Jupiter, as he touched the trigger of his pistol.   ' "Hold, Jupiter!" said the Captain, and he took hold of the threatening pistol. For a minute the two looked into each other's eyes; then the face of the black man softened, and he bowed his head, leaving the pistol in the hand of the Captain, !"The man is wounded and in our power, Jupiter. It would be weak to kill him." "But, Captain, he's awful. He's not fit to live or die. He has stolen more of my people than any. other slavedealer in old Virginia." "That may be. But these are the years of God's vengeance upon the buyer and seller, and the wicked oppressor of your race. He is opening prison-doors so                  \.   V VOICTORY.        165 and breaking chains. Let us be patient, waiting His * will."  "He tried to shoot you, Captain. That is how I made a prisoner of him. "Well, Jupiter, let us be braver and nobler. We will not return evil for evil. Let this man live and repent. You say he is not fit to die, and I think he is not. Then you know it is a piece of barbarism to shoot a prisoner. The free men of the North cannot stain their hands with such deeds. And you, Jupiter, the representative of a new type of Southern freemen - must set a good example. The greater your provo- cation to shoot him, the nobler will be your conduct if you spare him." "Yes, Captain, I know you're great and good. But you haven't been two hundred years in the far- nace of oppression, with your mother sold when you was a-suckin' baby, and your wife torn from you, and forced to be a concubine." "O, Jupiter! I these terrible things shall end. I know the Almighty has borne with such abominations as long as he can, waiting for men to turn from them voluntarily. The smoke of his vengeance is rising from fields of battle. It shall continue to rise and grow denser, until the sun is hid, and the stars and the moon fail to show their faces, if men harden their hearts against his' command to 'let my people go." "What are these, Jupiter?" "Papers I took searching the prisoner." "et me see them. There's a small lamp in the pocket of my overcoat. Will you bring it?"    166       VICTORY. "Ah I his name is Madbury, is it? I know some- thing about him, too; " and turning to the prisoner, he said, " perhaps you may be gratified in knowing that the man who saved your life a moment ago, is the Yankee prisoner whom Miss Winton nursed in Richmond." "Your introduction is unnecessary. Perhaps you have forgotten I saw you in the hospital., But a man who feels himself foiled of an undertaking, will not forget the face of the intriguer very easily." {"Ah! Then you knew at whom you were aiming to-day, on the battle-field?" "Did you think you could cheat me out of old Winton's daughter, and not feel the terrors of my vengeance?" "I do not know that you should harbor vengeance towards me because Miss Winton nursed me. She came voluntarily." "Yes, and went from the hospital to the Yankee lines. Very likely she went without help." "She may have had help, doubtless did, but I sup- pose you know I was in the hospital a long time after she left, and could not have helped her." "I know what I think about it, and whether in the hospital or not, I don't believe she ever would have got a;way if it had not been for you. Old Winton owes me money, and promised me his daughter, - curse the Yankees I '" "Never mind about cursing them. Don't get ex- cited, it will inflame your wound.;" "What did you taunt me with being the Yankee Bell Winton nursed for, if you wanted me to keep cool?    Il        VICTORY.         167 "I thought it would gratify you to know you had not killed a man whom your affianced bride had nursed back to life. You would thus have undone all her hard work. You two should pull together - not in different directions." "Now, see here! Do you dare swear you did not help Bell Winton get away?" "I am not in the habit of swearing, Mr. Madbury, but I tell you I did not help Miss Winton to get away." "Well, Captain, I'll believe you, if you'll only do me a favor. You're a Yankee officer, and have influ- ence with the Lincoln Government. Now if you'll intercede and get her away from Fortress Monroe, I'll believe you." "I am only a Captain, and my influence would not go far with the Government." Well, I suppose money would. I'll give you ten thousand dollars if you will get her sent to Richmond. You take that to Washington, and shake it in old Abe's face, and he'll give up the whole Fortress." "I cannot hear such words as those spoken of our honest President. Money has no more value to him than straw, if weighed against principle. He is a man of justice and honor, and the Fortress of national life and liberty, which he is pledged to defend, will never be bought by Southern money, or given up to your threats, or cannon." "Don't you flatter the Yankee nation, that way. We shall beat if we have to fight 'til every Southern man is dead, and the women take the field. We shall- take Fortress Monroe, and Bell Winton will be released from the humiliating task of teaching niggers, and I shall save my ten thousand."    168       VICTORY. "Well, if that thought comforts you any, go to sleep on it. I must leave you. Come, Jupiter." "Where am I going to sleep?" "On the ground with the rest of the wounded, I suppose. We can do no better to-night." ", Pretty treatment for a Colonel, and a man worth as much money as I am." "We don't happen to be where money can buy good lodgings to-night, sir." "The ground six feet deep, is better than the beds he has made for my people," said Jupiter, as the two turned away. This battle of Antietam, whose fearful carnage the curtain of night kindly screened, was fought in that month, ominous in the nation's history for an act silently accomplished by the hand of a single man. Its deeds of valor were many and mighty. From the storm of the hot contest the Rebel host turned back- ward, and left the field. They crossed the Potomac unmolested and moved southward over the " sacred soil of Virginia." The battle is historic; and though the Commanding General failed of pursuing the enemy with any decisive results, we look upon it as a step towards victory. But the single and silent act of President Lincoln- the Proclamation of Emancipation, given under his hand in the city of Washington on the 22d day of Sep- tember, 1862, was a mightier step than any battle. It was a step in the right direction- a cannon-shot aimed at the heart of the Rebellion. Instantly the war adjusted itself to principle. The needle in the compass pointed due North and South. The army began to be sifted   VICTORY.         169 of officers who were in the habit of returning the flee- ing fugitive. A new inspiration infused itself into the soldiers, many of whom looked upon the contest as doubtful so long as the Rebels were allowed to retain their slaves to cultivate their fields and build their defences. This avenue of- strength could now flow in the direction of liberty. The negro who knew friend from foe, could seek the Union lines without fear of being again delivered to a master enraged by his escape. They could build our trenches. They could fight for us, if we would only put arms in their hands. 15   CHAPTER XVI. "And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them; and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire."-REV. xx. UP from the rice swamps and, the cotton fields and the cane brakes of the South, came a motley multitude of all ages and colors and conditions, to see the soldiers and flag of the great Republic, as they established themselves at different points along the coast. Did they go back again after they had feasted their eyes on the glorious vision? Did they have no other reason for the foot-sore and perilous way which many of them had tracked, but just to see the soldiers and the flag? Were they so entirely happy and, contented with their condition that they made their pilgrim visit and then returned? Had they toiled among the rice and cotton and cane a life long without receiving so much as a single penny, only to return again to their unrequited labor, after touching the hem of the garment of Liberty? Does the historian tell us of the return of any to the house of bondage, save those who were sent by (170)   '!].        VICTORY.         171 some officer who believed that this is the ".white man's country," and hated " niggers "? Men lost for years to their wives and children; women who had seen their husbands hurried off with another master; children who knew not where to find the mother that bore them; these were some of the dead which the hell of Slavery delivered up, When her awful depths were stirred by the shot and shell of the army of liberty. They came asking to be saved from the terrible fate of the bondman. They would work for the Government; they would go half naked and half fed if only they might find protection from the inhuman horrors which they knew so well. "Any- thing - anything but slavery," was the cry that went up to heaven from the lips of the motley multitude. Such men as Saxton and Hunter, Phelps and Butler, reached out to these yearning people, helpful hands. They gave them work and bread. They allowed them the luxury of teachers, and some of these eager chil- dren learned to read. There was one thing more they wanted to do for them, and the time had come at last. In Port Royal the negro was being armed. In New Orleans also these athletic men were coming forward ready to fight for freedom, and they were being armed and equipped for the battle. Sam Vining wore the army blue, and no knight in armor ever looked nobler than he. Bob, whose mysterious fate had been mourned by Nance, up there in the kfebel Capital, and for whom Bell Winton had dropped a tear, thinking it "too bad" her father sold him, stood shoulder to shoulder with Sam. And there was another in the First Regiment of South Carolina, who had thought he   T   172       VI CTO,RY. would rather fight for his liberty, than pick cotton- though had he been a white man, he might, on account of age, have obtained lawful exemption. He had long ago lost hope for himself until the faint embers were rekindled by the fire of artillery along the borders of his Sea Island cotton field. It was so many years since he stood on the auction-block in Richmond, that he had almost forgotten the vengeance which he planned for "Massa Winton" for dividing him from Huldah. One thing he had not forgotten, never should forget, though he lived until his locks were snowy as the staple of the South. The tears of his mistress and her endeavor to save him, were like jewels, in the dark background of his life. He knew those tears had made a better man of him. He had picked cotton with a patience born only of such a sweet memory. It was not the patience of hope. He had given up hope for any of his stricken race - and Huldah was buried in the grave of bitter recollections. Now that this hell of Slavery, was giving up her dead, hope revived. Who knew but liberty would come to the black man I Who knew but among the reunions of time, Jack and Huldah might come together I Hope on, my soldier, and hold fast your gun. A mountain of unbelief and prejudice must be cleft by its steely point, before any permanent help reaches your race. The white man of the North doesn't believe you can fight. And if you break that letter of his creed and do fight, you will be a cannibal and a barbarian. Already he sees you making a meal on your fallen victim, or using his bones for a camp-fire. Hold fast your gun, my soldier, and when you enter the valley   VICTORY.    .     173 of decision be firm and steady. Ah, I know, from my still retreat among the mountains, that you will be firm and steady without any counsel of mine. I have counted your stripes; I have measured the ocean of your tears. Tears not because of stripes, but because of the hopeless bondage which suffers the infliction of stripes. I know you will be steady. I have faith in humanity. But there are infidels here at the North who wait for proof. They keep prating and doubting. The terrible things they say of you, my soldier, are only equalled by those they utter against everything just and lawful. The honest and careful President is stabbed by their pens and tongues. The white wall of defence which has volunteered to stand between them and despotism, is coolly called "Lincoln's hirelings." Every man who lifts his voice in behalf of liberty, is aimed at by the shot of their vengeance. Even the church and clergy lie under the ban of their condemnation. They have no faith in anything that is simply honest and good. So take courage, my soldier- you are found in honorable company; and rejoice rather, because you are cursed and doubted. Don't let it weaken your arm when you stand in the valley of decision. Remember that they who doubt you, believe in Jeffer- son Davis. The valley of decision. Was it Port Hudson? Was it Vicksburg? Was it Wagner? Did any North- ern eye run over the columns of the Daily, and fail to see that black soldiers fought in these battles? Did any Northern eye fail to see they fought well? None but the eye of the infidel, and that is blind. 15*  174       VICTORY.  We did not expect him to see it, or confess it if he  saw. But the lover of humanity, and he who has  hope in his race saw the vindication of your manhood  among the shot and shell of the fiery trial. They saw  it, and to them it was the pledge of a better future  for your race. They felt that Americans could never  be unjust to the heroes of their battle-fields and the  defenders of their liberties. Henceforth the fetters  of bondage should be among the relics of a barbarous ? past -outreached, and outgrown oin the instant of  trial. There was not only good fighting, but there , were instances of individual heroism which will live : for ages. There is a flag-staff in the Massachusetts  State House, which tells in mute eloquence a story of -  heroism and devotion, never surpassed. I suppose  there is hardly a child in the North who has not heard  the story; and yet I want to record it here among  my steps to victory. The black color-bearer had been wounded in that furious charge on Wagner. He fell to the earth, but held aloft the colors. His strength was failing and the flag-staff could no longer bear up the ensign of liberty. Then he took the " stars and stripes " from the standard and crept on his hands and knees to the rear, marking the slow way with his blood. The words which he said to the watching soldiers, are the words of an American patriot. No soldier ever said more  inspiring words, or did a nobler act. "Here is the  dear old Flag, boys, and it never touched the ground." : Ah, who saved it from trailing in the dust before the  cannon shot of the rebellious defenders of the Fort? -'   VICTORY.         175 Do we say it was a negro? Will the time ever come when we shall cease to honor the deed, and feel thrills of a better manhood at its recital? Will the time never come when we are ready to say of a people capable of such devotion to the American idea, "they are men, and shall be brothers, and citi- zens of the Republic?" We shall see. They have been armed; this is a great step. Meanwhile we are all growing. This furnace heat has developed fields of thought remarkable, in conservative ap cool America. I think there will be heat enough to ripen the luxurious growth into a harvest of just and con- sistent law. Meanwhile, let me not moralize too much in the midst of history. The history teaches the moral, if only I follow the little threads which run out like fibres from my own heart and home. It was at Milliken's Bend. Sam Vining, ever on the alert like a true soldier, saw the enemy coming. The Colonel was in his tent. He gave orders to prepare for battle, and while the men looked at their guns, and came into line, he ran to the Colonel, saying: "The secesh are upon us, Colonel!" The Colonel ordered him to get the men ready. "We have done that now, Colonel." When the Colonel reached them, they were in battle line; every man with a determined air which meant "Liberty or death." The Rebel column came on. It numbered two thousand. Two hundred Western soldiers, and a thousand negroes met the onset of battle. The Rebels were enraged at the sight of negroes in arms. They  fought with the fury of demons. They were met by a   176       VICTORY. fury which had in it a deeper meaning than anger or  revenge. The assertion of the manhood of a race,    long held in servitude to these men who had rebelled  against the laws of their country, echoed from every  musket shot, and gleamed upon the point of every bayonet. It became a hand-to-hand 'encounter.  These men charged upon the enemy, and for a brief space of time, the fight was terrific, and its results hung in the balance. But the determined spirit of the  negro soldiers was an overmatch for the fiery rage of  the Rebels, and they were driven from the field, with  great loss of men and munitions of war. While the fight was hottest, and each Union soldier felt himself charged with the responsibilities of the issue, our hero, Sam, saw one of the Rebel officers, wheeling his horse to flee. He took sure aim, and crippled the horse so that he fell. In the fall, his rider was caught under him in such a way, as to make his release a painful struggle. While he was trying with all his might to extricate himself, his command was rapidly falling back, - every man intent on self- preservation. Nobody stopped to help him, but by an energy born of terrific fright, he at last got free, and started to run with the rest. He had not gone many rods before he felt the point of a bayonet at his back, while the cry of " surrender" rang through his head like the crack of doom. Somebody was upon him who could run faster than he, - whose nerves were strung by a more potent master than fear. He tried to escape, but the bayonet hurt him again, and he thought he would venture a look over his shoulder, r at the fleet-footed enemy. No sooner had Orestes *,:   VICTORY.         1" Lanker caught a glimpse of the face of Sam Vining, than he fell to the' earth, weaker than an infant. What could he hope from this black man he had so inhumanly tortured? Nothing but death. O, don't kill me I don't kill me, Sam, and I'll give ye yer liberty. I wont try to reclaim ye. I'll make out yer papers now, now this minute I "  "Do you see this coat of blue, Lanker?" "Yes, Sam, its a real handsome coat." "Do you see this gun?" "Yes, Sam. Don't kill me I O, don't!" "I have my liberty, without any occasion for thanking you, unless it be your desperate wickedness I thank." "I'm sorry, Sam. I'm sorry I licked ye so. I'll never do so again." "It is not likely you ever will." "Do let me go, Sam I See, all my command has left me, how they do run! let me go too, O do!" "Never! You have fought your last battle, sir, and whipped the last negro you ever will;" and the fearful bayonet touched his breast. "Murderer of my race, say your prayers. I give you five minutes for that." "O God I - I can't I I don't know how to pray I Pray, Sam I Pray for me " The negro beat over his gun, and closed his eyes - "O Lord of the souls of men; have mercy upon the soul of this counterfeit of a man, if thou canst have mercy upon him who never showed mercy. And, as he comes into thy presence, to receive the sentence   178     .  VICTORY.  of his doom, may the fires of hell be cooled a little,  because of a negro's prayer."             Sam opened his eyes. There, upon his knees, at   the feet of his former slave, knelt the miserable   Lanker, cringing, and crouching, and begging for   mercy. He remembered the terrible tortures he had inflicted upon his captor, without provocation, and  how nearly, more than once, he had come to murder-   ing him, and all hope died-out of his lean face.   Sam too remembered these, and clutched his gun    more tightly. He remembered not only his own past,   but the past history of his people. Wave after wave  of agonizing thought rolled over him, each calling for vengeance. He lifted his'gun. Lanker fell upon his face in terror. Sam looked upon him there in his helplessness, and remembered something he had read in his mother's Bible in the old hut, which was home. "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." He repeated it over and over again to himself. Then lifting up his hands from which the gun had fallen he said aloud, " O God, I thank thee!"Agony and ven- geance died out of his face. A tearful tenderness came over it-like gleams of softened moonlight. For several minutes he stood with uplifted hands, as though to hold fast God's promises and blessing. Then with a new strength, born of Gethsemane struggles, he said to the weak and prostrate man, "Rise up; you are spared. God shall judge you. I will not," and he helped him to the headquarters of the officer in command. A prison was such a relief to the fright- ened transgressor that he confessed afterwards, the time of his incarceration was the happiest he had ever known.   VI CTOR Y.          179 The historian has recorded that at Milliken's Bend, victory came to the Union arms in a contest against almost two to one. It was a glorious victory - for it proved that the negro can fight. But the victory Sam Vining gained over himself that day. was greater- than any victory at arms.   l.  .          y .^xv      : CHAPTER -  XVII.

It was his first furlough, but he had not taken it for pleasure. In the battle of Fredericksburg, where such firmness and daring as the Union troops evinced were un- crowned, save with wounds and defeat, he had fallen    in the front of the line. A severe flesh-wound in the thigh, and the terrible loss of blood it occasioned, made him long for rest at home with his mother and sisters. The hospitals were full of men injured in every conceivable manner, and it would make room for some fellow who perhaps had no home to go to, and he would go. He thought it would not be weak to go home, when he was unfitted for present service.    "' I would not touch this furlough if it were not for  : my wound," he said, as he folded the paper and placed it in his pociet-book. (180)   VICTORY.         181 "You have done heroic service, Captain Watts, and when you get well, you shall be promoted. I am sorry about the wound, but think it will do well." "' I am sorry to be laid up, but expect to take my chances of wounds and death." A"As for that, there will be no more fighting until spring. We must reorganize, and recruit too, before we can smite the Rebels to much purpose. So rest at ease. We shall not need your sword at present." There was great joy in the snug New England home when the anxious, waiting hearts were relieved by the presence of the boy they had sent to fight for liberty. They had followed him in march and battle with earnest prayers, and now that he was once more with them,- though wounded, and weak, they were full of devout thankfulness. They had never before felt such keen pleasure in watching by a sufferer's bed. "Had not the boy Warran come back to them from the valley of death? Had they not mourned him as dead while in prison?" And when the first tidings of the fight at Fredericksburg came so heavily Northward, their hearts had stood still with apprehensions of evil. Now that the dear home-roof sheltered the beloved, they knew that- those ominous fears which had shaken them so were fears for the cause he defended, and not for the boy. The weal of the Republic I Ah, -it was that which painted in white terror their faces, when they read in the evening paper that the troops were recrossing the Rappahannock on the pontoons. We who remember that-night, can understand how in the soul of every patriot, love of country, and fear of peril to liberty, outweighed everything else. Ah, I 16        . - ,   ;   182       VICTORY. remember the night, -bitterly, bitterly, - and all we ! talked about in the Mayor's parlor, a few of us who i had eaten and drank together, but who had such dis- similar ways of thinking. I remember how I shut my lips to keep back the impulsive words which kept knocking for utterance. I remember how our pastor who was one of us, kept himself calm as the Sphinx, in a bearing, and from his lips poured out oil and wine. 7 You too, my friend, have your memory of that night, , when hints reached you of defeat, and your memory is bitter. But that is passed now, thank God I "I wish you had brought Jupiter home with you, Warran." "The country needs such men as he, father; he could do no good here." "But I could thank him for-twice saving the life of my boy." "You do thank him, dear father, in granting him the privilege of bearing arms. He desired to enlist immediately in a colored regiment and has done so. I offered him the privilege of coming with me, but he declined it, saying, "You are going home, Captain, I can do you no good there. Let me fight for a home for my people -I am strong." "Noble words, my boy." "Yes, Jupiter is a noble man. There are not many better among white folks. He has been true to me, and vigilant as the eye of fate. He saved me at Antietam, and carried me from the bloody field of Fredericksburg when the Rebels were pressing down upon us, and but for him I should have been again a prisoner."   VICTORY.       .  183 "I hope he will live till the war is over, and share the liberty he is fighting to maintain." "I think he will. So far he seems to have borne a charmed life. I know he has been shot at times with- out number by the Rebels, who were furious at the sight of a negro among us. I -suppose they were too furious to take good aim." "So far, it looks rather dark for the Union cause. But I cannot believe God will forsake the right." '^ Now that we are assuming the attitude of a nation fighting for liberty, I believe, we shall see God's help- ing hand. He could not smile upon us while we con- tinued to send back into bondage the fleeing fugitive. The President's Proclamation of Emancipation is worth more to our cause than many. victories. It has set us right, father." "I know. Nobody rejoiced more at its coming than I did. And now giving the negro arms, we have taken another step forward. O, we shall be victors in the end. And though the cost will be terrible, I believe the results will pay." "Yes, father. If we make this a land of liberty to all, no matter what the cost, it will pay. I shall be  / glad to give my little life." The days of the Captain's furlough were flitting by. He was gaining as rapidly as could be expected con- sidering the fearful wound. Home care wrought its miracle upon him--keeping him always hopeful and cheerful. There were no ogres of discontent or repining in his home. Nobody to fret him by cursing the Government and the war. If there were any such spirits among the neighbors they did not venture into   184       VICTORY.  the presence of the Captain, whose sentiments were well known to all of them before they heard of such a thing as Rebels in arms. I am glad I can say that  of my hero. Many a man at the North knowing in    i his heart the nation's sins, would not look upon them, or allow himself to think of them. He certainly would  not denounce them. It might hurt somebody's feel- ings who was a party concerned. But Captain Watts,  like his father, had always given voice to his convic- tions, and when the hour of trial came, people knew where to find him. - Happily, most of that class who had closed their eyes because of impotence to mend the matter, opened them very wide, when they heard the Rebel guns- and kept them open, too. So that now they stand abreast in sentiment with the heroic  Captain, albeit they may be a little ashamed of their former record. Of that class the writer of these  pages confesses with shame to have been a member. But if there is possibility of atonement for the indif-  ference of years, which were perhaps too unripe for serious thought on such tremendous subjects; theni there is hope that the words and deeds of these years of war may be accepted as such, by Him who keeps  the record.  Captain Watts had never in his letters mentioned the name and services of his bright little nurse in the :I Richmond hospital. He knew all the household read  his letters, and "father might think there was too much romance about the incident to accord with the stern realities of war times." But now that he was at home, and an invalid, he recalled those days made so pleasant by a woman's tender ministry, and wanted :ii   VICTORY.         185 very much to tell his sisters about the girl. But they had always known him as a timid, shrinking boy, who was very shy of the young ladies, and he hesitated day after day, fearing they might think him in love, or in danger of being, if he indulged himself in talk upon so interesting a subject. Mary, the youngest of the three, and his most intimate companion, imag- ined something was on her brother's mind which he wanted to tell of, and did not know how to begin; so after she had hugged the imagination for several days and grown quite confident she was right, she resolved to help him to a confession by the leading strings of a few questions. "Warran, something troubles you, I know. Some- thing you want to tell me about. Now don't, dear brother, wait any longer. Of course I'm ready to listen." "How did you know that? Are you a witch, or a prophet?" "Why you sit a long time and don't say anything, and then you start up and look as though you were going to speak, and don't. It's easy enough to tell, I'm sure." "Well, I do want to tell you a little incident of my experience. I thought it might interest you, seeing you are a woman; but then maybe you'll think it is not very soldier-like for me to tell it." "O you needn't play soldier now you're wounded and at home. Be my brother just as you used to be, and tell me everything." Thus encouraged, the young Captain told the story of Bell Winton. Mary listened, alive to her fingers' 16*   186        VICTORY. ends, with eager interest. When he had concluded, she said, {"What a splendid girl I and you are under such an everlasting debt of gratitude to her, too.  Why Warran, I must say I don't think you have treated her very handsomely." "Why-not, sister?" "You should have sent us word about it, and offered her a home with us until the war is over." "She would not have accepted it. She is spirited, and independent." "But you could at least have made the offer, when you are under such obligations to her." "It would have been of no use, Mary. Only a waste of words. And when we talked, it was on im- portant subjects -subjects of vital interest to the country, and to humanity." "O you were very stately, Captain. Now I think you might have said some grateful and even tender things to Miss Winton, and not disgraced your shoul- der-straps." "It was no time for tender things, sis. I did try to express my gratitude." "And did not offer her a home when she was a fugitive from her father's house - under such bitter circumstances too. I will go straight and write to her myself, and tell her that my brother is better than he seems, and invite her to come and live with us until the war is over. Maybe by that time, old Madbury  l will get killed, and she can go home to her father's house in safety." The last words of Mary's little speech made the Captain tremble a little. {' Go home to her father's,   T TOR Y.         187 after the war." It disturbed slightly the sweet dreamy picture he had locked away safely in a corner'of his heart. He did not like to have any thought or word disturb that picture. "Say, Warran, may I not write to her, and ask her to colne?" "Yes, you can write if you want to, but she will not come." "Don't you ever write to her? I have carried your letters to the office, and have never seen that name.' "No, Mary!" "Why, Warran I How ungrateful!" "It is better I should not write to her. We ha;ve each our work to do, and need to be in the very best mental condition for its accomplishment. The vicissi- tudes of war are many. It is not pleasant to watch and wait for letters and not get them. She could not well follow me inD my winding perils, and I could not sit down at evening and write her about them.' If she has any interest in me, it would trouble her to know that I suffer sickness or wounds." "Trouble her more not to know it. - I'll warrant she has set you down for an ungrateful Yankee." "Well, so much the better if I get killed." "I shall go this minute and write to her. You ought to thank me, brother, for teasing the secret out of you. I will help to set you right with Miss Winton. She shall not harbor the- thought that you are un- grateful." Warran smiled at his sister's eager interest, and she tripped out of the room to write the letter, and leave him to his reflections.   188        VICTORY.               It was a gushing, frank, warm-hearted letter that Mary Watts wrote. She thanked Bell over and over  s- for taking care of her dear and only brother, and told ?: her that he was not at heart ungrateful, though his conduct might seem so, -that it was diffidence made - him not offer her a home with them till the war should end. Then she invited her most cordially to come North and live,- to come if possible before Warran got well, - at any rate to spend the summer under the roof of friends who were under so many obligations to her.                       i Bell Winton, reclining at evening, on a couch in her own room, weary, weary with her persistent labor, received the letter with its New England post-mark. "Some of dear mother's family," she thought had found her out and sent her a word of comfort. She tore it open. That was a new name at the end of the neat page. A sudden thrill shot over her as she remembered who of all she had known, bore a part of it. But the soldier was not called Mary. She read quickly the warm, kind words. They needed no in- terpreter. She thought Captain Watts had blessed sisters to write so tenderly to a stranger like her. For a moment she felt like flying to the secure and restful shelter which was proffered her. It would be so sweet to kiss the soil of that land where her mother gathered in early years the elements of so true a womanhood. So sweet to give up for a time this earnest thought and endeavor, and rest. Yes, it would be very, very pleasant to see the dear girl who said such adoring words about the man who told her she saved his life.   VICTORY.         189 She knew it was a noble life she had saved. She liked to hear her intuitions repeated in words. How fair it looked up there, among such sunny thoughts and such noble sentiments. She forgot about the ice and snow. Green fields and flowers alone corresponded with the warmth of her ideal picture. And he was wounded, and all winter had been off duty and at home. Well, he was safe, it was pleasant to know that. How she longed for home too, - such a home as she had never known. And these strange people had offered her a home. Should she go? It would be very pleasant, but would it be right? Who would fill the little niche which she had tried so faithfully to occupy? And if another could take up her work and do it well, - would it be right for her to seek rest in the midst of such crying needs? She was not sick. True, sometimes she felt very weary, but sleep rested her, and she took up her task afresh every morning. Then had she not a personal respon- sibility to discharge? She was the daughter of an owner of slaves, -a man who had more than once resorted to the auction-block for money, though hearts were broken under the hammer. She felt that she had such a responsibility. That it was her duty to repair, so far as possible, the wrongs which had dis- honored her name. A life of consecrated labor would be little when weighed in the balance with the evils done to this lowly people in the name of Winton. No she would not seek rest. She would stay and work while the war lasted, if she lived so long. Then, maybe, the reconstructed South would educate its poor, and she could be spared from her pioneer post.   190       VICTORY. / After Bell Winton had put aside the sweet yearning for rest and home which Mary's letter had kindled in her heart, and gained the serene summit of self-surrender to the call of duty, a gentle peace came over her, soft and tender as the arms of a mother's love. Her weariness slipped away like a dream. She felt upborne above the clamorings of this world's needs, as though she were sailing on wings. In that sublime exalta- tion of soul she had gained the truest rest. She would never sigh for any other. None so entire as this, outside the gates of heaven. What of the sunny slopes of New England now I Her heart was wrapped in the atmosphere of a more genial climate, and around and below her, fairer hills gleamed and receded, as she sailed. No more longings for home. Eden with its bloom and fruit had given her abundant wel- come and entire satisfaction. She had gained all things, - she asked for nothing more. The 'evening hours passed unnoted away, and her exaltation of spirit was only intensified by the beatific visions which the angel of sleep unveiled. "I knew she would not come, Mary; but that is a. glorious letter; let me read it again. She's a true soldier. Don't she face the battle grandly? One would think her a canonized saint, by the way she renounces the world, and self. A few such women would redeem this whole country, - and we have them too, - not just like her, but noble, heroic women. How like martyrs they endure the awful absence when we go out, nothing but boys, from the tender care of home, to lie in hot trenches, to bivouac on   VICTORY.         191 the open field, to march in dust and rain, to walk up to the cannon's mouth, or charge upon a bristlihg wall of steel, to endure wounds and sickness, to die as hundreds of thousands have and will, for the life of the Republic I How they pray for us at home, and work while they pray. From early morn till black midnight the needle clicks in their busy fingers, every stitch a thought of the soldier, and every thought a prayer for the salvation of the land. How this vision of the busy and watchful mother, sister, or wife, nerves the arm when we go into battle. The homes which shelter such women, shall be sacred to liberty while there is a right arm of man for the defence." "Dear brother, I thank you for this. You and father are forever talking about liberty to the negro as our only sure means of success, and I had half concluded we were entirely counted out in your reck- onings." "No; Mary. The place you occupy is one of acknowledged power. Discussion is not necessary to prove that woman is our powerful ally in this struggle; that she is our continual reserve force, standing, an impenetrable defence, in the rear of every battle, and on the vantage ground of every victory." "But it is very pleasant, Warran, if we occupy a place of acknowledged power, to hear the acknowl- edgment occasionally with our own ears." "Has my little sister failed to hear it? She should go with me down to our camp, and hear what we talk about- 'When the candles are lit in the parlor, And the Atars in the calm azure sky.'   192       VICTORYo She should see and hear when the letters come; and the boxes with good things for us. Ah, Mary, I be- lieve every man who has gone out from a true home, has made himself felt in the hour of trial, as though he were doubly armed. The acknowledgment of your co-operation is written in our aims and endeavors, and shall- be written in victory." "Not without the help of the negro, Warran, you forget." "No, I do not forget this element. I embrace it in every thought of victory. We cannot conquer alone. There is a monstrous injustice standing in the way of success. The click of your needles, and the agonizing pathos of your prayers, will avail little in an unholy cause. Jefferson Davis prays, and Southern women make shirts and stockings. But he prays for the suc- cess of a slave empire, and his soldiers who fight for it wear the shirts and stockings. Our deeds and prayers must harmonize with Heaven's justice, to insure success. That harmony is being slowly evolved. I believe it will become entire, and universal. That we shall follow up the steps we have taken in the way of justice to an oppressed people, until we stand upon the Lord's side, and smite the oppressor in the name of brotherhood and liberty." "I see, dear, and understand too. I just wanted to tease you a little, and make you grow eloquent on your favorite theme. But I am glad I called you out, for it does me a world of good to know that weak woman is even counted a helper in the great work.

"Speed on the light to those who dwell In Slavery's land of woe and sin I And through the blackness of that hell, Let Heaven's own light break inl ' ELCOME, Burnside I Welcome to East Ten- D^!: nessee I "These were the glad words which greeted the army of deliverance as its steely blue columns penetrated this region of suffering and terror. Old men with their snowy hair, which had been wet with the dews of heaven, and rested on a pillow of rock for weeks and months, came out of their hiding- places blessing the Union army. They had fled away to escape torture and death. They had skulked among the friendly mountains, subsisting as they could, while their homes had been devastated by Rebels. They had been hunted like beasts, and if any was captured, his martyr-blood paid the penalty of his fidelity to country. Welcome the power which was able to defend the cause of human rights! The young and strong had fled to the Union lines, and were enrolled among our soldiers. Isolated as they were, they could not defend their homes from the ravages of Rebels and (194)   VI CTORY.        195 guerillas. Then again they were impressed into the Rebel service if they stayed at home. They could not fight in an unrighteous cause. They could not lift their hands against the Government of their fathers. So they fled, singly, and in little groups, --hiding for days in the mountains, - when danger was imminent, and making forced marches when they could do so, until they were safe under the sheltering flag, and holding the rifle of its defence. East Tennessee gave more men to the Union army, than any other State of equal population. The fiery trials through which this people had been called to pass, developed the highest type of heroism, -a heroism born of patriot blood. They fought the battles of the Republic, while they knew that all manner of perils threatened their homes. Starvation pinched the faces of their women and chil- dren, whose stores had been stolen by Rebels; .and dungeons and death threatened their helpless old men. But the privations and terrors of the present, were nothing, to the brave Tennesseean, compared with the impending terror of success to the Rebel cause. In that he saw only tyranny and perpetual death. For what is life to the brave soul when liberty is hope- lessly gone? They knew sornething of the meaning of caste and class in the South. They would never bend the neck to this yoke; they would fight for equal rights to the last, and if starvation and death swallowed up the present generation, they would gain liberty for the next I - And so they left all and followed the flag. When the old men and women and children saw the return of the banner which had life-long protected them,   196       'V I C T O R Y. and under which their sons and brothers and husbands fought, there was such joy among them .as cannot come to mortals, except when the arms of relief touch the extremity of peril. They sung words of welcome ; they waved handkerchiefs and banners; they covered their faces and wept. The soldiers were awe-struck at the spectacle of gladness which greeted them. The dangers of their weary march, the mountain passes, the unbridged streams, the tangled and rough ways were forgotten, when they saw the joy of the people they had come to rescue. It was a miniature representation of the great joy which shall settle'down upon our beloved land, when her institutions are rescued from the bloody grasp of rebellious oppression. At the North we rung the bells, and waved the starry flag because of the redemption of East Ten- nessee. We did more and better. We went unto the altar of the Lord, unto the altar of God our exceeding joy, and gave him the praise for success to the Union cause. Then we watched for tidings of our beloved; and- to many of us there were tolling bells, faint, sad echoes to the joy-bells of victory. {"The Colonel will not be safer than the Captain," said the father of my hero, as he waited for news. Not a word had come from Colonel Watts since he started from Vicksburg to rejoin Burnside in East Tennessee. The days were going by, and several weeks had already been numbered, since he took up his march. The family at home tried to calm their apprehensions by saying over and over, "these are   VICTORY.         197 war-times, and mail communications are greatly broken up. His letter may have miscarried." Colonel Watts, promoted to the position of his com- mander, who fell at Antietam, had fought at Vicksburg and no harm had befallen him. That port and strong- hold, had yielded to the persistent blows of Grant's iron army, qnd now the men who had lived for weeks in the trenches, who had watched and waited for- victory, were relieved for duty in other places of danger and need. The Rebels were gathering forces to drive Burnside from Knoxville and East Tennessee. Longstreet had come with his veterans, and again that persecuted people felt the terror of the invading foe. Their valleys and mountain passes echoed to the roar of contending armies. The forces of the Government were much imperilled by being stationed in small bodies, at posts which the Commanding General thought it necessary to guard. Colonel Watts with his command was on the south side of the Tennessee river. His soldier instinct told him that he occupied a perilous place. Should the Rebels attack him there in any force, his chances of defence would be very small. He made the best pos- sible disposition of his men, and kept his eyes open. Whatever else might happen, they should not be surprised. If the Rebels came upon them, they would meet some of the iron hail of Antietam and Vicksburg, and might be hurt a little. The Rebels, from the beginning of the war, have managed to find out where our forces were weakest; and concentrate their fury at that fatal point. They 17*   198        VICTORY. repeated their old tactics in East Tennessee. The little picket posts were furiously handled. Colonel Watts's apprehensions of danger to his command were speedily realized. They were attacked by a greatly superior force. They fought like lions so long as there was the least hope to kindles their powder, or inspire their hearts. The men were falling thick and fast. The Colonel gave orders to fall slowly back. They did so, fighting with all their might at each step of unwelcome retreat. What was this? Guns were thundering in their rear I They were cut off Trom help I There was no hope but surrender, and very little hope in that. Almost better death than a Rebel prison, and the Colonel thought he would die, before he would sur- render. But a second reflection made him put aside that rash thought. He had once escaped from Rebel authority, perhaps he might again. It was a bitter experience to deliver up his sword to that imperious power; but that love of life which comes to soften oqr rash endeavors in the extremity of peril, came to the Colonel, for himself less perhaps, but for his men, he accepted the only alternative. They were taken to Danville Prison. The awful horrors which make us blanch with terror as we read them in the daily papers, were experienced by this little band without the least mitigation. The filthy cars in which they were transported, the starvation rations which were issued them on the way, the whole- sale robbery to which they were subjected, the cob- meal diet in prison, the bare floors, the chill winter,- ah, the record of this barbarous treatment is written   VICTORY.         199 on thousands of graves, and- thousands of pinched faces, and from these a cry goes up to heaven --it is the voice of Abel's blood. The crimes of this latter Cain are written all over him in letters of fire. It is a terrible record. But the most burning crime of all, that which has touched the heart of the North more sorely than all the shameful catalogue besides, is the slow torture and starvation of our brave North- ern boys in their hellish bastiles. There is not in the annals of heathenism, anything so awful. The fires which consumed the Hindoo victim, were mercy in. the comparison. So were the rack and guillotine of the Inquisition. There was a momentary quiver of agony and all was over. But our prisoners at the South have been subjected to every refined element of torture. Letters from home have been shaken in their haggard faces, and then burned because the demanded dime was not forthcoming; when these demons knew they had robbed them of the last penny. Contributions from home, - of money and clothes and medicine, have been taken by Rebel commissioners and their agents, to the amount of many thousands. Then day by day our boys grew whiter and thinner. A pint of meal, ground cob and all for the daily living of a man I And too often not a spark of fire to cook it with. They would take water from the filthy stream which drained their camp, mix it with the meal, and eat it raw! Is it a wonder that fourteen thousand lie outside the Andersonville stockade? Is it a wonder that of all who have gone down into this black valley, but a meagre remnant ever return? And they are crawling skeletons. I have seen them, and I know.   200        V ICTORY. And as I looked upon these boys once fair and strong, and thought of the awful crime which had wrought its fatal work upon them, I made in my heart a vow, and with my pen will keep it, as well as I have the power to do, - "Eternal warfare upon that crime of the ages, American slavery, which has made barba- rians of the boastful chivalric South." Does anybody believe, after seeing a skeleton from one of their prisons, that the slaves they have held in irresponsible power for hundreds of years, have been exceedingly happy and contented with their keepers? Does anybody believe that the laugh and dance which have been called to attest their happy fate, when some North-man visited the plantation, were the expression of joyous hearts? If anybody can so believe, in the face of recent revelations, their credulity must be made of very pliable material. It is a sort of credulity which adapts itself with remarkable ease to certain cases. Those who believe on the evidence of a laugh which somebody saw years ago " down South," that the negro is happy and contented in slavery, do not believe on the evidence of their own senses, that our prisoners have been starved, or that the graves are unnaturally thick about Belle Isle and Andersonville. "But what if some did not believe? Shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect. Nay, God is true." His faithfulness to the least of these downtrodden and oppressed is sure, and we trust amid the furnace heat that the oppressor shall feel about him, the effect of God's unchanging law may be seen and acknowledged, in liberty to the -slave and salvation to the Republic.   VIC T ORY.        201 Danville Prison seemed far off from succor, to the Colonel, as he thought of its geographical location. And as its dingy walls closed about him, a feeling almost akin to despair took possession of his heart. What wonder? He was tired and hungry. Would hope ever revive?  Doubtful; if beef and bread have anything to do in building the sunny guest. The bare boards on which he lay down to sleep did not refresh him very greatly. Besides -robbed of his blanket, he lay cold. That was not so pleasant. He had heard it said that officers were better used by these prison-keepers, than the rank and file. He trembled and shivered for his men. What would they do, if worse off than he? He did not believe they were. . Next day he saw some of them walking about the inclosure, coatless, hatless, shoeless. They had not taken his clothes. Perhaps the fine gold repeater and roll of greenbacks made them adequate compen- sation for removing him to these hospitable quarters, and so they left the coat, hat, and boots to their owner. He felt very much obliged to them for their wise and kind consideration. But what would they do with the clothes taken from his men? O, wear them, to be sure I He himself had seen whole regiments of Rebels in our army blue. Some sad mistakes had happened in consequence. We had thought them our own men until their treacherous and fatal movements revealed the wolf in sheep's clothing. "Well, well this is a dreary prospect," mused the Colonel, as he went to a hole in the wall and looked out. Lucky for you Colonel Watts, that you have just arrived, and have some of your Northern nerves yet. You can't dodge like that when you've been here a spell. "What!   202       v ICTORY. shoot us if we look at daylight, do they? This is magnanimous.  ' Chivalric,' as Northern apologists for Rebellion would call it. Well. Am I to stay in this vile den without a sight of heaven, or a breath of air? Eat cob-meal and sleep on a board in the bargain." The Colonel was a little provoked at being shot at. That was an extra he had not considered in looking over the bill of fare of this famous resort. He ex- pected all the rest, even the loss of his watch and money; but he did not expect to be made a target for the sportsmen outside. What could he do? He looked about the cell. It seemed like a wall of rock to his nervous and eager scrutiny. It was not rock at all. Only boards and iron, and not so far from terra firma, either, he found when he took a calmer sur- vey. In the same room with the Colonel, were several officers of other regiments and two of his own Cap- tains. While he was peering about the walls, Major Day, who had been several weeks in confinement, asked him what he was looking for. "Some loophole of escape," replied the Colonel. "You cannot find it. I have examined. And if you should get out, the guard are thicker than flies; you could never get through them." "But why do they shut us up in this little attic? I would a thousand times rather have the liberty of the stockade. Fresh air could be had in larger quan- tities outside, certainly." ' Not very fresh, Colonel. Soap and water are not plenty about this establishment; and the atmosphere can't be quite equal to -the White Mountains. Why   VICTORY,         203 they shut us up here, I suppose they think us danger- ous men --plotting Yankees; safest under bolts. Maybe, too, we were captured fighting furiously. I was, I know, and ordered a round or two after sur- render was imperative. They always watch such men closer." "Well I'm not going to stay here." "How will you help yourself, Colonel? We are not likely to be exchanged at present." "I will petition to be allowed the liberty of the grounds." I "And have a bayonet pointed at you at every turn, and hear a gun pop if you come within a rod of the dead-line." "As for the guns, we are not safe from them here. At least I am not, if they shoot a fellow for just using his eyes. I have always been in the habit of using mine. I shall look out of that -hole of a window before I think where I am." "And get shot." "Yes, if not successful in dodging." "You had better forget you have eyes while in prison. I have almost forgotten I have anything- but a stomach." "We shall be likely to remember our stomachs last here, if to-day's ration is a sample. Don't we have anything else?" "Once a month perhaps, a spoonful of xice, or. an inch square of rusty pork, by way of variety. The corn-cob is the staple fare." "We shall starve on it. I am ravenous as a bear, now.",   204       VICTORY. "You'll get better of that. The raspy hoe-cake will soon fix your hunger. You won't care whether you eat or not when you've been here as long as I have." "Don't, Major. Your account will kill me, before the regular processes have time to do their work. But this is awful I What do the Rebels mean by such inhuman treatment?" "They mean that ' one Southern man can whip five Yankees,' if they are only under safe prison guard. Seriously - they mean to wear us out, body and soul, and if we don't die outright, unfit us for further oppo- sition to their damnable schemes." "They cannot be lacking in provisions. If they are, why not parole the prisoners?" "They think we'd take up arms again as soon as we could get them, exchanged or not. That's the way they do. No, they do not lack the means. It is a contrived plot. I believe old Jeff. himself gives the orders for our starvation." "Let us escape, Major. We can do it, or die in the attempt." "Very likely die in the attempt. We could not get out of these horrors, and if we could, we are in an enemy's country." "You forget our faithful allies, the niegroes. They would help us. They would secrete us, feed us, pilot us - anything to help ' Massa Lincoln's boys,' whom they look upon as their saviour." "No I don't forget. I don't believe we could trust them. I haven't much faith in niggers. - They'd be more likely to deliver us up to the first Confederate officer they met."   VICTORY.         205 "Major Day, you are mistaken. I know better than that. They helped me in my escape from Libby, and they will help any Yankee soldier who asks them for aid, and don't abuse them." "Then you've been in prison before, have you, Colonel? How did you get away?" "I just told you the negroes helped me, - gave me ' massa's best horse and revolvers,' and one of them, a splendid man, went with me." "So you have faith in the everlasting negro?" "I have reason to believe in him. But I am happy to tell you that I believed him a man, and not a species of cattle, before he rendered me any personal aid." "Well I don't like the idea of bringing him into this quarrel. We might all have been exchanged if it had not been for the folly of arming the blacks." "The negro is already in this quarrel; we have not brought him in. The Rebellion is an attempt to rivet more securely the chains of slavery. And certainly, you would not think it just to the negro, after he has helped fight our battles, to make no provision for his safety, if captured?" "The mistake is just here. He should never have helped fight our battles, then these provisions for his safety which keep us in prison and starvation, need' not have been made." " But what should we do with him? He came to our lines in overwhelming numbers, asking'the priv- ilege of bearing arms. So eager has he been to help himself, that black servants have time and again picked up the fallen gun and used it vigorously in battle. Should we send back the flying fugitive?" 18   206        VICTORY. "I am not quite ready to say that, Colonel. If he is brave enough to get away, why I say let him have his liberty." "And if he is brave enough to fight, I say let him have a gun!" "You will sing a different song when you have been here awhile. All the prisoners curse the arming of negroes." "Better curse Jeff. Davis, as you were doing just now. His prolific brain would manage to find excuse for refusing to exchange us, if the negro had not been armed. He is pressed. He knows we have, and can raise, the most men. He only makes the- matter of equal exchange an excuse. His real excuse is the mature purpose to weaken and unfit us for service, as you said but a moment ago. Don't change your tactics, my dear Major, because of the everlasting negro. Better fight it out on the same line." 1"I haven't changed my tactics. I do believe our starvation is planned in the Rebel Capital. But I believe they are .ten times harder with us because we have armed the negro." "Well they will not gain much by their vindictive- ness. We shall have one or two hundred thousand black troops to hurl against them by another summer. Then we shall end the war, and open the prison doors, and break all the chains too, a long time sooner by the help of these allies."      s   % s   CHAPTER XIX. "I hear around me sighs of pain, And the cry of fear, And a sound like the low sad dropping of rain, Each drop a tearI " END for my sister Mary, now that you have finished the will. I must see her before I die." Westgate Winton lay stretched upon his couch. He was white and thin, and inm his eye was the un- aatural light of consuming disease. The times had dealt heavily with him. His slaves had all run away except faithful old "mamma," and with no child's voice ringing through the rooms, the old house was desolate indeed. Then, the Confederate cause had not prospered as he expected. -He -did not think the war would last so long, and there was no prospect of a termination yet. The Yankees were marshalling their hosts for the summer campaign. Grant was Commander. He took Vicksburg, deemed impreg- nable by all Richmond. Maybe he would take the Capital too, if he set out to do it. His name was a terror. ^ '(207)   208        v ICT OR Y. Mr. Winton had fretted a good deal about Southern failures. Davis had not done the wonderful things he expected of him. The Yankees had held out wonder- fully and there seemed no end to their endurance. The prospect looked dark. He was a nervous man; and between worry over the loss of his slaves, his money, and his child, he had found little rest, and now he was almost worn out. He had not noticed the choking cough, all the previous winter--had thought nothing about that. His were mental troubles. But the cough had done its work, and he was going, going very fast. He had summoned an attorney to adjust his worldly affairs. There was little left to adjust. Madbury, who had stayed within the defences of Richmond since his release from capture, watched carefully the old man's decline. He demanded money for Mr. Winton's indebtedness to him, He had almost given up taking Fort Monroe; and the possession of the daughter looked very doubtful to him. He would be secure at any rate, now that Winton was dying, and if the girl ever turned up and he could get her, why that would be so much good luck; a sort of un- expected interest on the old debt. When Madbury was secured, there was nothing of consequence left. Some household treasures,---that was all. "Bell, my dear, I am summoned to Richmond. Your father is very sick, - so says the letter, ---in the last stages of consumption. He is almost alone, and wants me to watch his dying bed." "O, Aunty. My father sick, dying  I must go too." "I am afraid to have you go, my child. It is likely Westgate's pledge to Madbury remains the same."   VICTORY.         209 "But I am not- afraid of Madbury I not afraid of anything. If my father is dying, I must go." "Let me go first, and see how matters stand, and then if it is safe, you call come." "My father might die before I could reach him, if I wait. I will go with you, Aunty. No matter for my safety, if father needs me." { Bell, it is not best. You have endured uncounted perils to escape this slavedealer, and you must not let your feelings get the better of your judgment now. I will go, and send you instant word as soon as I ascertain the condition of my brother's affairs." "Go to-day, Aunt Mary, if I must wait. Do not forget that it is my father who is dying. The hours of suspense until I hear from you, will be terrible." "But hours of suffering can be more easily endured than life-long trouble, dear." "I know-I know. Let me help you start." As soon as the requisite passes could be procured, Mrs. Denton went to Richmond.   She found her brother quite as low as the attorney's letter had repre- sented. Then the condition of his mind was sadder to witness, than his wasted body. His repinings at his losses, and his lamentations overthe failure-of the Confederate cause, were pitiable indeed to his noble sister. Her heart was almost broken as she witnessed the wreck of such splendid possibilities. Westgate had promised well in youth, but false ideas had ruined him. From his almost incessant complaints she ascer- tained the true state of his affairs. without asking any questions. "If Bell had not run away, I need not die so, -in 18* - .       210       VICTORY. poverty and shame. She could have married Madbury and saved my money." This he would repeat scores of times daily, and no persuasion could win him to a better view of the matter. In vain his sister told him that Bell's happi- ness should be dearer to her father than goods or gold, that Aladbury was odious to her, and a life-long of misery would await a marriage with him. He did not seem to understand. He had thought in that one channel, until there seemed no possibility of turning him out of the old ruts. Money, slaves, temporal success, or what he looked upon as such, had been the staple of his life-long thinking. It seemed a vain thing now to endeavor to win him to higher thoughts, unless indeed the light of eternity should shine more brightly down, as mortality wasted away. "Would you like to see Bell, my brother?" {See her, yes. But I never shall. They have got her there at Fort Monroe, teaching niggers. It is an abomination that a Southern girl should descend so low." "Perhaps I can bring her home. If I should tell her of her father's illness, I know she would come." "No, you could not get her. I went after her myself once, and she wouldn't come." "Shall I send for her?" "Yes, send; tell her to come quick, for her poor old father is dying in poverty and shame, and nobody but she can make it any better." "You do not mean to say you would still insist upon your promise to Madbury? I thought that was all settled."   VI CT ORY.        2" "It is settled. But he'd give up the house and the money too, for Bell. He likes Bell. And I'could die in peace." "In that case it would make no difference about the property. Bell is your only heir, and M1adbury would get it all the same." "Well, I should not die in poverty and disgrace. I should have it till I die; and have something to- bury me with." Mrs. Denton knew her brother's indebtedness to Madbury had been legally settled, and did not antici- pate any further trouble from him. The promise had been so much money or the daughter. The money he had received, or its equivalent in real estate. The old house waited his possession when the present occupant had done with it. So she wrote to Bell, telling her all; not forgetting to give her necessary hints as to her father's mental condition. Her letter was answered as soon as possible by the presence of the child in the home of her youth. Mr. Winton seemed glad to see her. A sort of childish gladness, as over a new and pretty toy. Bell watched him almost constantly, running to do the bidding of every caprice, and soothing with soft words, or a song, his irritable moments. She talked or read to him, until he found little time for his old repinings. And when he indulged in these, she tried to win his thoughts to something outside of himself. She ven- tured to speak to him of the life to come, and the beloved ones who awaited him there. She talked about her mother, and the sweet and tender impres- sions she had of her life and character.. He listened   212        VICTORY. like one dreaming. He was dreaming of the early days, before his wife became an abolitionist, and the wall grew between them. They were pleasant days; why did he let the wall grow? She could not help her opinions. He remembered how sad she used to look. He had promised up there in New England, to love her. Had he fulfilled the vow? Had he not let his heart grow full of ice and hate? It was melting, now, as Bell talked about her. He remembered she was silent, and had no retort for his bitter words. Why had he not remembered it sooner. It only came now to sting him. "Bell says there is another life. Can the past be repaired there? I guess not. It is gone, and sealed up. My life is gone. O God, how is it gone? What good thing have I done?" Yes, the ice was melting. The tender, almost radiant presence of his child, was making a child in spirit of this dying man. He had never seen such an angelic woman, he thought so, as Bell moved about, with her sweet ministries. And yet, one of whom his child was the perfect model, had walked by his side many years. He was blind then, but the scales were falling. The light of eternity bent near the pillow of his second childhood. He repined no more over the losses of goods and gold. He only sorrowed that life had been to him a loss. "Read it again, Bell. It comforts me. I never heard that before." "Let not your heart be troubled. Ye believe in God, believe also in me-" "Yes, I believe in God. He made the world. Read on, Bell."   VICTORY.         213 "In my Father's house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you-" t"Who, Bell, me?" "Yes, father, if you believe, for you." "What shall I believe; Bell?" {' Believe in God, the Father, and the Lord Jesus, the Saviour of men." "Can he save sinners like me?" "He can, and will. 'And if I go, I will come again, and receive you unto myself, that where I am, there ye may be also.'" "Where is it, Bell?" It is heaven, dear father. Where mother is, and all the good who have ever lived in the world." "But I am not good. I broke your mother's heart." "She will forgive you, and so will God." O, my child, the past is dark. It haunts me like ghosts. I can see Jack's tears on the auction block, and your mother's too, and hear her pleading. How real it is. And poor Bob I How he and Nance begged not to be separated. I did not heed. My heart was stone. And now I am dying, and these sins, with innumerable others,come to haunt me. Is there forgiveness for such as these?"  "Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow;. though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool." "O God, -have mercy I " The sweet release of death drew near. Bell sat by her father's bed. For a long time he had not spoken.   214       VI CTO I' Y. They thought he would never speak again. A serene look had settled upon his long troubled face. His eyes looked steadily upward as though he saw visions. "See, Bell. Your mother I " He lifted up his arms as he spoke. Then they were crossed upon his breast, and the silence of death hushed forever this heart that had so deeply sinned; so truly sorrowed, late -but not too late. Madbury heard of Mr. Winton's death, and came in to look after matters a little. He was very officious in his suggestions as to the funeral, and offered to send a military escort, and have all proper honor con- ferred on so ardent a supporter of the Confederacy. Bell objected to any parade. She wanted a private funeral, and so told Madbury. "But it will not confer sufficient honor upon the deceased, to bury him privately. He was a great man among us; I have no doubt the President him- self will attend the funeral, should it be public." "Have respect for my sorrow, Mr. Madbqry. I do not want a public funeral. I am worn with long watching, and could not endure it." Madbury said she should have a private carriage, and need not be troubled with the display, but it was absolutely necessary that one so conspicuous in his devotion to the cause of the South, should be properly honored by his old associates. And saying this, he went awav. "O Aunty, what business has this man coming here at all at such a time?" "You know his connections with your father were very intimate. I suppose he thinks it his right."   VICTORY.         215 "And must we bear the trial of a Rebel escort at father's funeral?" !"I see no other way. Madbury is determined, and should we oppose it on other grounds than those of feeling, we should very likely suffer the fate of thou- sands of other Unionists in the South/--be shut up in prison." The day of the funeral came. The Rebel escort, with its seven-starred banner, was out in large pro- cession. Madbury, and several other officers came into the room where Mr. Winton's body lay, and began to wrap the " stars and bars " about his coffin. Bell saw it and uttered a scream. Aunt Mary, wiser, and less impulsive, pinched her arm. She stifled the words which knocked for utterance, and bowed her head, and found relief for her outraged feelings, in a flood of tears. The coffin was borne to the hearse. Mrs. Denton and Bell followed, and entered the waiting carriage. Madbury, with the assurance characteristic of his class, took a seat opposite them. Bell took refuge in tears. There was no other help. The band played doleful airs, and they moved on to the city of the dead. When they halted to deposit the body in its final rest, Bell got out of the carriage, and stood by the open grave. She wanted to see the spot where they buried her mother, before she knew much of life. Madbury followed her, and waited by her side. She had a glimpse of him. Heavens i how it shocked her. He had crape upon his hat and arm. What business had he with signs of mourning for her father?  216        VICTORY. She hardly heard the old priest as he read the burial service. A sudden terror made her white and faint. She sunk down upon her mother's grave, and for the time. longed to be at rest. There were perils in the future; she could feel them. Could she breast them alone?"Ah, God knows," she sighed, amid her tears. Madbury touched her arm. "They are going," he said. She rose mechanically, and he led her to the car- riage. The return was darker, to her heart, than had been the journey to her father's grave. Such mem- ories had surged through her dizzy brain I Such fears had taken hold of her I After they arrived home, Madbury, with several officers, followed them into the parlor. Bell rose to seek her own room. "Will Miss Winton grant us her presence a few minutes?" observed the obsequious Madbury. "The attorney desires to read the will." Bell staggered to a sofa. The attorney proceeded to read. Madbury watched Bell, expecting to see her evince surprise at the condition of her father's estate, and her own portionless future. He saw nothing of the kind. She seemed as calm as though they were reading the daily news. Less so, indeed, than it was possible for her to be, when there were tidings of battle. "You see, Miss Winton, your father's indebtedness to me has taken nearly everything he had. But I beg you will not be at all troubled on that account. You shall know no difference in your home. Stay right here, just as though your father was living."   VICTORY.         217 (' Have you done with me now 7? she said, turning to the lawyer. "Yes.. I have read the will." "And the furniture, piano, and silver, are mine? ' "Yes. And that is all." Bell left the room. After she was gone, Madbury told Mrs. Denton he hoped her niece would experi- ence no distress on account of the way things stood, that he was ready and willing, to provide for her, and he trusted she would understand what was best for her, and not attempt to leave the house. "I think Bell will prefer to return with me to Newherne. She would not like the idea of depending on the charity of her friends." "You misunderstand me, madam. I am not talking -of charity. I expect to retain the girl as my wife.' It was her father's wish." "I know all about that, Mr. Madbury. But you took the money instead, and now, can have no pos- sible claim upon Miss Bell." '"I have the very strongest claim. I am personally attached to the girl. In fact, I love her, if man is capable of loving." "{ If you love her, you will certainly consult her wishes. You would not force her into marriage against her will." "If I love her,. I shall follow my -own wishes. That is my idea of love. When do you return, Mrs. Denton?" "As soon as I can get ready. In the course of a day or two, at most." "Well, I will bid you good evening. Bear my 19   218       VIC TORY. compliments to your niece. Tell her I will call again very soon." "Bell BellI there is no time to be lost. We must go instantly. Madbury has said in so many words, that he shall retain you as his wife." "I understood his insinuations. But you have not the passes?" "I will get them to-night. And we will take the first train in the morning." Mrs. Denton ran out to obtain the passes. The officer told her he had received orders from Colonel Madbury, to allow no pass to Miss Winton. He would make out hers, with pleasure. "But Madbury has'no business to stop Miss Winton. He has no authority over her. She came here to watch by her father's dying bed. She has no relatives here, and desires to make her home with me, her aunt, and nearest of kin." "I don't know about the authority, I only know about the orders, and I must obey.'? "But has a Colonel authority to give any such orders?" "' I have given him my pledge, and there is no getting out of it. Miss Winton cannot go out of Richmond." Aunt Mary took her pass, and turned away. It was of no use to talk with the man. He was evidently bribed, and she could do nothing by her arguments or entreaties. "Give me your pass, Aunty. .The officers will not know whether Mrs. Denton is old or young. I can get through on it, and you can get another, and follow me."   VICTORY.         219 "I will do that. It may succeed." Bell's trunks were packed, and as many of the valuable household treasures as could be stowed into them, she tucked away with her wardrobe. "Mamma"  went out to engage a conveyance for the early train. The two slept little that night. There was too much to think about. With the first signs of dawn, Bell dressed herself- for the journey. At the appointed hour, the conveyance stood by the gate. She bid Aunt Mary good-by, and opened the hall door. A Confederate soldier very politely informed her that he had orders not to let any young lady pass out of that house. Here was an end to the little ray of hope. The house was guarded. She could not even reach the train. She turned back, whiter than at the grave yesterday. "O Aunty. I am in the power of that- base man I Don't leave me! IMy only hope is in you." "I will stay with you, my child, unless I am ordered away. You shall not be forsaken in the hour of peril."  It was a dark day - darker than any Bell had ever known, and she had faced dangers before. But they seemed to her light as air, when compared with the great cloud which had settled upon her. Towards evening Madbury called. Bell refused to come into the parlor. He walked up stairs and ap-  proached the door of her room. She knew the step and instantly turned  the key. He rejoined Mrs. Denton. "You should not press your suit Mr. Madbury. Bell is in affliction." ' "I guess she'll survive the affliction of losing a   220       VICTORY. father she ran away from. I think the marriage should take place immediately. It is known that Miss Winton has no friends here, and it will be scandalous for her to stay alone and unprotected in times like these." "I have made up my mind to stay with her, until she recovers somewhat from her grief.:" "And I have made up my mind you'll do no such thing. You forget that I own these premises." "But you would not be so cruel as that, to your intended wife." "I shall remove all stumbling-blocks out of the way of my success. And I consider you in that light, madam. The "' day or two at most " will be up to- morrow, when I shall expect you to leave." "I should not be an expense to you Mr. Madbury. I can pay my board. I think it absolutely necessary; in my niece's present mental condition, that I stay with her.' "I see no such necessity. I shall expect you to go, as I said." With these elegant words Madbury went away. Bell's distress was appalling when Aunt Mary told her the purport of the interview. "She would die before she would submit to marriage with that wretch." "Yes, Aunty, hear me - I will die by my own hand first." {"I trust some relief may come before any such fatal extremity as that is reached." "There is no hope, Aunty I No hope." "Grant's army is coming, Bell."   - CHAPTER XX. "Father just and kind I Whom man hath bound let thy right hand unbind." OLONEL WATTS behaved so well in prison, that the officers in charge concluded that he must be quite contented. They allowed him some privileges on the score of good conduct. He arrived at the distinction which he craved without even asking for it. He could walk about the "grounds" at pleasure, as the boys called the miserable stockade, He found as he tried his limbs in the open air, that they were not quite so supple and strong as he could wish, nevertheless he thought -they could be trusted in case of necessity. There was one thing quite certain, they would grow no stronger while the bill of fare remained at its present corn-cob leanness. There was no prospect of improvement in the bill. He saw in vivid distinctness the goal of this continued fasting. Every day, as the dead were carried out, he saw it. Many of his own men had already starved to death. He did not like the prospect of following that most awful fate. Every day as he loitered outside, among the boys who were growing whiter and thinner, he kept his eyes open and took longing looks at the 19*     (221)   222       VICTORY. reaches of freedom over the guarded wall. He could not, like Samson, carry off the gates, and letiout all these dying heroes --he wished he could. He thought it would not be wrong to save himself if possible, from the fate which stared at him with such hungry eyes. If he made the attempt to escape he would take his life in his own hands, and nobody but him- self would be involved in the peril. So he watched and waited. It was a dark day in February. A drenching rain had driven the prison martyrs into whatever of shelter they could find. The guard crouched sullen and a little less vigilant. They did not watch every inch of area, and every minutest noise, as was their wont. The pouring storm roared above common footfalls, and its thick darkness obscured somewhat the move- ments about the stockade. The Colonel thought his hour had come. He rejoiced in the presence of clouds and darkness, and prayed that they might continue and lend their shadows to increase the blackness of the night. It was a glorious storm! As the wind whirled and whistled, he thought of New England, and a little of the strength of her rocks came at the thought, and touched his wasting sinews. The night was gathering. Thank God, the storm too, gathered force from t'.e wings of darkness. It had grown almost terrific. The guard hid their faces in the capes of'their butternut overcoats. These kept off the rain somewhat. Little use were their eyes in this blinding night. They might as well cover them with protect- ing cotton. Little use were their ears, already they were deafened by something kinglier than cotton.   VICTORY.         223 How the wind swept and moaned I How the rain pelted and roared I Good I One soul of all the pale multitude crawls under shelter that night, to watch the deepening shades--not to keep himself from a drenching. Nobody would miss him from his prison attic. Nobody would venture out to count shoulder- straps on such a night. ThereI It will not be wilder or darker than this. Creep, Colonel; creep a little past the crouching, dripping guard. Good I they don't see you. Scale the enclosure now, athlete! Ah, you can. I'm glad you tried so soon. A few more weeks of corn-cob, and you could never have done that. Now stand up and walk. It is fearfully dark I know, and the storm is in your face, but face it, my hero I It comes from the sea. It is better than North, star or compass to a fleeing prisoner. Didn't he face it through all that awful night! Swift and straight abreast the driving rain, he marched on. No soldier shoulder to shoulder with comrade ever kept steadier beat with his footfalls. How strong he was 1 Do you know what made him strong? I'll1tell you. It was liberty. There is a tower of strength in the very name. There is mightier -strength when that tower rises above the fortress which is our personal defence. We feel it if we have eaten prison rations for weeks, feel it as men feel and realize all their bless- ings, by glorious contrast. "I will rest now, these-are our friends," said the Colonel, as he entered the door of a slave hut in North Carolina. They gave him shelter and refreshing food, asking no questions. They knew by the color he wore, that he was one of "Massa- Lincoln's "- boys.   224       VICTORY& "Are there any Confederate soldiers about?" he inquired when he had eaten his breakfast. ( Did you say you thought him " very unconcerned for personal safety, to eat his breakfast before asking that question?"Well, we will excuse you. It is not likely you ever tried the bill of fare at the Dan- ville hotel for two months and more. Then it is possible too, you have not the Colonel's faith in our black allies. I think if there had been an army of Rebels outside, he would have felt safe in the hut of a slave.) "No, massa. None jes here. Dar am a little speck ob guard out to town but it don't mount to nothin'. It am all little mites o' boys." "Then, Sambo, you and Phillis won't be afraid to let me sleep here all day, will you?" "'Fraid. No. Neber find a darkey 'fraid to let dat ar uniform sleep wid him." The Colonel went to sleep, -" never slept so well before," he has told me since. Next day he was missed at the prison, and some show of search made for him, the authorities knowing all the while that their attempt would be utterly useless. They made the show, however, to frighten - the rest, andthen reported that he had been captured and hung to the nearest tree. Major Day believed it, and was glad he never tried to escape. The Major was not likely to escape unless soon exchanged, except by way of that narrow pass where thousands upon thousands of livid lips have plead for entrance from amid the horrors of starvation,--the skeleton weakness - the delirium, - the despair I   VICTORY.         225 "No, Sambo, the stars are out to-night and I shall make good headway. They will -guide me. No, you need not go. I thank you both for the food and rest you have given me. I would give you greenbacks if I'had them, but the Rebels stole my money." "Sambo neber take massa's greenback, ef he hab forty hundred." 'T Well, good-by. There is a better day coming, I trust, for you, and for the land. Your chains shall all be broken. Good-by." Night marches through the swamps and under- growth of North Carolina and over her mountains, in any season and at any time would not be very inviting, but for an escaped prisoner in the last of winter and early spring to wend his way-through the unknown, I think some additions would be found to the common hazards. There is nothing which could tempt a man to encounter these and risk his life, as he would in the encounter, but that deep and abiding love of liberty which has its home in every worthy soul. For several nights the Colonel took up his lonely march, followed by its restful days, always passed among the black loyalists of the ,South, without any- serious impediment. The country was nearly stripped of men. General Lee was marshalling his rebellious- host for a last encounter with the goddess of Liberty. He had conscripted everything that could hold a gun and stand alone behind defences. They were gath- ering behind the Richmond ramparts, or hurrying forward to the banks of the Rappahannock. Our hero's escape was much safer because of this barren condition of 'the country. The plantations were deserted except by women and children. Hardly   226       VICTORY. any old men were left to guard them. Their gray hairs, straggling thinly over troubled brains, - were trembling and floating in the March winds that swept along the Rebel defences. Pity them I for the Rebel king made them fight for his throne. Many of them wept while they put their hands to the gun, and dried their tears with thinking of the blank cartridges they would load it with. Colonel Watts had come to the line of the Raleigh railroad. He walked carefully, with good vigilance, always. The moon was out, and he felt the need of especial caution. He heard noises as of men talking loudly. There must be a depot near the point where he had touched the road. He crouched and listened. Presently there were sounds as of an engine firing up. He crept farther from the track and hid in some bushes. The noise of men came nearer. He could hear them talk. W"We don't start these two hours, got to wait for cars from Louisburg. Curse this waking up for noth- ing. I'm going to sleep again. The guard'll wake us, Josh, le's go to sleep. Here's a capital place, right here ;" and the Colonel saw two men coming directly towards him. What should he do? Not stir. That would surely be betrayal. He looked and listened. On they came. When within a few feet of where he was, one of them said, "Here, Captain, this knoll will make a good pillow," and down they lay. From his covert of bushes he could almost touch them. "It's damp-here," said the-Captain, after they were stretched out, "let's go in them bushes."   VICTORY,e         227 "Darn it, no-I can't get up, and besides I'm 'fraid of snakes. Here, Captain, this'll keep off the damp," and the two drank heavily of whiskey. "My pistols hurt," said the Captain. You won't let me forget 'em, Josh, if I lay 'em one side while I sleep?" !"No, I would; they're darned big and hard on a feller's side." The Captain reached out his -hand and laid his pistols down. Colonel Watts saw the gleam of their shining barrels as the moonlight smote them. a Let's go to sleep now, the guard'll-wake us," said the Captain, heavily. Presently the 'two began to snore. There was no time to be lost. The Colonel crept noiselessly from under his covert, reached out his hand and took the gleaming pistols; then stole carefully away in the opposite direction from the noises of men and steam which he still continued to hear. He had not gone many rods before a train whistled along the road, and he heard it-break up, at a little distance. The depot was quite near, now, he knew. Then there was a call for the -men to wake up and "all aboard." When they were filing into the train, they missed the Captain, and men went hither and thither calling his name. It seemed to Colonel Watts he never would waken out of his drunken sleep. Finally some of the runners espied him and higs companion snoring in the moonlight, - or perhaps they heard them, - and a good shake brought them to their senses. They staggered off towards the train. The poor fellow was not sufficiently conscious to miss his pistols. When he did, I suppose he felt certain   228       VICTORY. they were lying in the field where he slept. It is not likely anybody could make him believe a Yankee soldier took them from his side and coolly walked off with them. The Colonel crossed the track, and pursued his journey without interruption, for the rest of the night. He thought a fine opportunity had come to him, a real Providence, almost if not quite equal to the way Elisha was cared for in the far-off times. Arms might be to him better than bread in his perils. But of food he suffered no lack. They were not ravens who fed him, but men and women black as they. Ah, these too were God's providential helps to the young seeker for Liberty and the Union lines. Without them, his journey would have been impossible, however well provided with arms. These black people gave him all needful help. They went as guides when there was any danger to be avoided. Over many a rough and weary mile they led him, that he might escape the guarded stations, which were more frequent as he approached the eastern portion of the State. Once he lay a week concealed in a ravine, and these people fed him. He had been discovered by a planter's daughter and her Rebel escort, out for a stroll at night.. The soldier took the lady to safe quarters, and then gave the alarm. Fifty horsemen were out in pursuit. They went within a rod of where he was hidden. They scoured the country for miles, then gave up the chase. The Colonel went on, saved by the loyalists of North Carolina. He was nearing the coast. Had he been permitted   VICTORY.         229 to march by daylight, he would have looked now, fo'r signs of the old flag. He knew our forces had been at Washington and at Kingston. He did not know whether they held these places now. Maybe our lines were drawn in a- little, about here, that the boys might go to swell the grand army, gathering for its final achievement. He was cautious, and did not venture much on daylight yet, though I think the imagined nearness of liberty made him somewhat bolder than was safe. One morning, as daylight broke about him, the country looked so desolate, that he thought he might press on a little farther, he was not very tired. So he followed the sun for a guide, now that the stars had faded, and crossing fields and tripping through woods, he made several miles headway by daylight. Some of the country looked familiar, and he thought it might be the ground over which some of their little inland marches had been' taken, when they were stationed at Newherne. This gave him courage. Newherne had a very pleasant sound in the Colonel's ear. "Mrs. Denton lived there, and over her porch waved the starry banner. He had passed some very pleasant hours at Mrs. Denton's. She was a loyal woman of the true type." Of course the Colonel disclaimed any interest in Mrs. Denton's niece. He had not thought of her, in making his way towards the coast. O no! Of course he had not. He was a soldier and took that way, because it promised the surest escape from Rebel dominions. - Well, let him disclaim; but we shall see 20   230       V I CT O tY. him seeking the straightest way to Newherne, never- theless. Ah, my hero, it was a sorry thing that you got to dreaming of Newherne and Mrs. Denton just then. Yonder ride two Confederate horsemen. They have espied you from the road. See, they dash after you across the fields. Why don't you look, you inveterate dreamer? You are lost if you dream much longer. They have seen the blue coat. They kneiv before they descried its color, that it was a runaway Yankee, or Rebel, who walked cross-lots so fast. The hungry pursuers press on. Where are your ears, Colonel Watts? But the soil is soft and spongy, and the hoofs of the horses you cannot yet hear. He has heard, - he runs. What hope in the speed of a foot- man against that of mounted men? He will run, though, whether there is hope or not. But he hopes; - see, there is a hiding-place yonder, perhaps. His pursuers challenge him to stop, with the whizzing tongue of a bullet. He does not heed the challenge. There is a ditch a little way off, and an embankment made in hollowing it, rises on the other side. Ile presses to reach it. Pistol shots fly After him, thick and fast. How he runs! With the agility of an antelope, he leaps the ditch, then the embankment, and disappears on the opposite side. They think he must have fallen, " not possible to escape so many shots." The Colonel curls up under the edge of the embankment, and examines his pistols. They are all right; loaded seven shots apiece.  Thank that drunken Captain up there on the Raleigh road. No, thank God for his protection, let it come in whatever guise.   VICTOrKY.         231 The Rebel pursuers cannot scale both moat and wall, and there is not a foothold for a horse between them.  Shall they ride round? No, it is far, and they are too eager for that. The foremost leaps from his horse, and climbs up the embankment. He looks for the Yankee, and points his pistol, as he sees him lying there alive. There is a sharp report,- but not of the pursuer's pistol. A man falls heavily, but it is not the Yankee. The other rushes on. It cannot be the runaway is armed. That must have been his companion's shot, but he fell heavily over the wall. He climbs a little cau- tiously and peers over[ pistol in hand. Before he can pull the trigger, his arm is nerveless, and he lies stretched upon the ground, wounded but not dead. The Colonel approaches him, and disarms him, - the wound had done that pretty surely, --but he had done with dreaming of Newherne,and would be cau- tious now. "Are there any Confederate forces near?" he asked. "Tell me truth, or sleep with your fellow there." "There's a cavalry comp'ny two mile off." "Which way?" "Toward Newherne." "How far is Newherne from here?" "Not more'n ten mile." Then the Colonel took a handkerchief, and bound up the man's arm. Then he took the garments of the sleeping Rebel, and put them on over his own, slouch- ing the hat about his face. "Now we will go," said he to the wounded man.   232        VICTORY. The frightened fellow got up at the word, and the two sought the place where the horses were left. The Colonel took the best horse, and ordering the Rebel to mount the other and lead the way to Newherne, they rode off. As they started he said, "If you make any attempt to betray me to your company, should we pass it, I will instantly blow you into eternity." Keeping the Rebel ahead, they rode fast and faster on the way to Newherne. As they came to the place where the cavalry company was encamped, an officer halloed them with--"What luck?"  The Rebel, under fear of death, answered, - " good luck," and dashed on. The officer called out,-"Come into camp and report." "Haint finished the job yet," replied the Colonel's Rebel escort. What that job was, he did not care to inquire. He desired a swift ride just now; The horse was good, though not quite a match for Captain Rush- back's fine Arabian. He had no especial fear of pursuit, yet he spurred his horse and kept him at good speed. A little more than an hour's time brought them to the Union out- posts of Newherne. The soldiers on guard saw two Confederate horsemen riding fearlessly into their lines. They thought them deserters and raised a shout as they came on. The Colonel asked the guard to con- duct them to headquarters. He then told his story, took off his Confederate disguise, and delivered up his prisoner. As soon as Colonel Watts could make himself pre- sentable after his long weeks of toilsome travel, he sought the little house which looked to him so much   VICTORY.         233 like home. I am not skilled in that style of writing which consists of dressing and undressing the hero or heroine, or spreading the table with every describable luxury, if I were,I would tell you the Colonel break- fasted- on hard tack and coffee.- That his clothes were all rags, boots and all, and that he was obliged to draw on Government stores for an entire new out- fit. The quality -well, they were clothes for a soldier, and we hope the quality was good. The color you all know. It is the color of heaven, only a little deepened. I keep my child's faith in the sky,- it is heaven to me yet. The Colonel was in fine spirits and excellent health, and looked well in his new clothes. At any rate he felt well in them. Perhaps I ought to add that he employed a soldier barber to trim his chestnut curls, which had not felt the scissors since his capture up in Tennessee. And I suppose truth demands that I tell you he likewise trimmed his beard. I am -glad I can give you the assurance that he did not order it shaved off.  My hero believes in God and Nature. Thus renewed, he bowed his head and passed under the banner which still stood sentinel by Mrs, Denton's door. While he waited response to his summoning rap, he noticed that the worn flag had-been mended in more than one place, that it might still flutter its folds of promise to the waiting faces who looked at it with longing eyes; that it might still repeat in sweet tones of assurance, promises of victory not afar, to the Union arms, and the cause of humanity. The widow met him herself with such words of joyous welcome as went straight to his heart. They 20*   234       VI CT O It Y. sat down together to talk over the past. The Colonel did not ask for Bell. But every slightest noise made him look towards the door in eager expectation. Mrs. Denton had talked very fast, and plied the Colonel with questions concerning the part he had acted since he went out from her door so long ago. She knew he must know of Bell. She could not keep it from him, so she told him all, and how herself had but just arrived from Richmond, - sent away by the wretch Madbury. I cannot tell you how the terrible truth of Bell Winton's imprisonment in her old hdme, smote upon the Colonel. He was not a demonstrative person. He did not make any outward sign of the inward weight of terror. He did not make any rash vows- not any vows at all, except in his own heart. But he felt all the awfulness of her situation as keenly as though his sister Mary had been there instead. Is that enough? Perhaps there were deeper pangs. Let us not be too inquisitive. He rose to go. "Come again, Colonel," said Mrs. Denton. "These are lonesome times to me now little Charley has followed the flag, and dear Bell, I tremble when I think of her." "If there is a vessel Northward bound, I may not come again. I must be one of the great gathering army. General Grant will want all of us. O, if we could take Richmond to-morrow! God bless you. Keep heart. Good-by." "Good-by, soldier of liberty, and may your hand help bring deliverance."   CH APTERX XXI. "He who cooled the furnace, and smoothed the stormy wave, And tamed the Chaldean lions, is mighty still to save!" ADBURY was ordered to the front. Rich- mond must be defended by the old men and boys. Every able-bodied soldier was needed to meet Grant's invincible columns. He Adid not like to go. He did not like the danger his shoulder-straps might encounter. He preferred the bluster and parade of war, to its bitter work. But General Lee, and Jeff. Davis were greater than the rich and chivalrous Mad- bury. There was no other way, he waS obliged to go. As. soon as he received the order, he called on Miss Winton and informed hex that he had waited long enough for the subsidence of her grief, that he was ordered to the front and must start immediately, and he desired to give her the protection of his name before going. In vain she plead for longer time, saying she could not lay aside her mourning for bridal clothes. Madbury would wait no longer. "To-morrow eve- ning is the time I have fixed. I start next day to join General Lee. Rev. Mr. Robes is invited and all the arrangements are made. A few of my friends will come." (235)   236       VICTORY. Bell knew her entreaties were futile, so she made no reply. She knew, too, it would be useless to tell this man her determination. She had told him long ago she would never marry him. She would not repeat the words, they might take away the one day of grace. "If we are to be married to-morrow night," she said, "I shall greatly need the little intervening time, Mr. Madbury." He had showed no signs of departure after making known his plans. "There is nothing you need to do; be married just as you are." "There are many things I need to do, and ought to have every moment of the little remaining time." "I came to pass the evening, Bell. You have hardly had the opportunity of becoming acquainted with me. It is but fair that I spend one evening in the society of my future wife." Bell turned away and opened the piano. What could she do with this determined man? If he chose to stay she had no power to help herself. There was a guard outside. So she resolved to save herself any further annoyance from his tongue. She began to sing,--gay songs,--the gayest that she knew. No sooner had the notes of one slipped from her lips, than she struck out on another. Song after song floated and swelled through the rooms, until people gathered in crowds about the windows to listen. It was not common to hear such music now. Had the old glad days come back again? Or were they dream- ing?- One heart at least must be very gay, - so the listeners reasoned. Some of them knew the house.   VICTORY.         237 What did it mean? Mr. Winton had been borne out a corpse not very long before. Who could sing like that in a house of mourning? o Bell knew nothing of the crowd, thought nothing of the past; her present had transfixed her. She was trying to forget even that, in the drowning waves of melody. Trying to charm the serpent which coiled at her feet. At least she would fill the room with such a flood of noise that her ears should be spared the tor- ture of his hissing. She sung on, forgetful of war or peace, of Rebel or Yankee. She touched the notes of the "Star-Spangled Banner."' How the victorious words leaped from her heart. Stanza followed stanza. Madbury did not know the song, or for the time had forgotten that he was arrayed against that banner. She touched the last triumphant words. The-- old house echoed and re-echoed to the stirring music and its prophetic meaning, The notes died away. -Even Bell was entranced with the rapture she had drank in, from the song's victorious promise. Hark I what is that? Is the house coming down? Madbury rushes to the door. - An excited crowd demand the meaning of such a song in the Rebel Capital. Madbury don't know. Must have been sung inadvertently. He is utterly powerless to explain. They clutch him for a traitor and bear him. away. They threaten to tears down the house, but some of them who knew Mr. Winton, interpose and assert his faithfulness to the Confederacy. The guard stand sentinel at the door, and none of the mad listeners are allowed to enter. Finally an officer comes from head- quarters and vouches for the fidelity of Madbury, and   238       VICTOrEY. assures the wild mass that the song was sung in deri- sion. "Mr. Madbury was confident of that. Nobody would dare sing that song in any other spirit in the presence of the chivalrous Col. Madbury." Gradu- ally the crowd dispersed, and Bell, who thought she had sent off Madbury for the time at least, went to her own room, where she sat in long conference with "mamma."  Afterwards she slept. The unnatural excitement had passed away, and she found rest as sweet and refreshing as that which comes to the tired child. The next evening, Madbury, accompanied by a half dozen " friends " and the distinguished Mr. Robes, halted his fine team in front of the old Winton mansion and proceeded to enter. "Mamma " opened the hall door for them, and then settled back on the stairs in an attitude of the profoundest grief and terror. "What's this?" said Madbury; "why have you no lights in the parlor?" "O Massa Madbury I Poor ole ' mamma ' neber can - neber can tell I " "Never can tell what?  Go and light up, this instant!" "Oh, oh I Neber no more light in dis house. O laws a mercy I Oh H" "'What is all this hubbub about? Out with it, you old fool." "Miss Bell I Miss Bell! I "{ What about Miss Bell?" "Gone - gone - clear gone off." "How has she got off, and the house guarded? Where has she gone?"   VICTORY.         239 "Poor ole ' mamma ' wish she did know;, her ole heart's broke." "You do know. If Bell Winton has got out of this house, it is through your help; now, do you tell where she is, and not be long about it."' "Poor 'mamma' seen nuffin ob Miss Bell since mornin'. She eat her breakfast and den she go up stairs, an' when de dinner come, I hunt all dis house ober, and no Bell nowhere, "--and the poor old woman burst into- a flood of tears. "This is pretty business!" - and Madbury stepped to the door and consulted awhile with the guard. They averred that she could not possibly have left the house. They had watched every minute, night and day. This he was disposed to believe. Had Bell possessed money, he would have thought it possible the guard had been bribed. But where could she go in Richmond? He did not believe she had any friends who would hide her from him. He returned, and again plied the old servant with questions. "Bell could not have left the house. The guard say it is impossible. Are you sure you looked every- where?" "Eberywhar, massa, whar a body could get to hide." "Give us lights. I prefer to use my own eyes." And Colonel Madbury mounted the stairs, followed by his friends. They proceeded to Bell's chamber, which was thoroughly overhauled, closets, bed, and all. Even the drawers of her bureau were opened by this chivalrous hunter; he expecting all the while to see her curled up in one of them. Then other rooms were   240        VICTORY. ransacked in equally thorough manner, all the cham- bers being turned into utter confusion in the bride- groom's endeavors to find his bride. Then they pro- ceeded to the attic, tipping -over the old chairs, emptying trunks of cast-off clothes and bed-clothes, looking into and under everything of rubbish which the years had stowed away. The lower rooms, closets, cupboards, cellar, garden, all were minutely examined. A fly could not have hidden from this hunter, had he been after the fly. He came back to the parlor, followed by his fellow-helpers, utterly dis- comfited, baffled. His rage was terrible. He wanted a victim just then, and could hardly restrain himself from thrashing poor old " mamma." "I believe you know where she is," he again added, as if to find some pretext for the blows he wanted to strike.  "No use tellin' ye nuffin', Massa Madbury. Ye don't believe poor ole ' mamma."' "No, I don't believe you. The girl was left here with you, and the house guarded. She couldn't leave without your knowing it, I'm positive of that." "I 'spect she's gone dead." "Dead I Where?" "Mebbe in de well." "What would she drown herself for?" "Dun no massa. But poor ' mamma' she listen at de door de night 'fore missus go back to Newherne, an' she hear Miss Bell say, ' I kill myself fust.' " "Why didn't you tell me this before?" "How did I know what Miss Bell mean by it? Dat's all I hear."   Vt CTORY.        241 ' Confound it all. Drown herself. Let's go and examine the well. I don't believe she drowned her- self." The well was examined, but no young lady came up dangling on their hooks. Then Mnadbury gave up his hunt. Thele was nothing more he could pry into. "What should he do? He would thrash Dinah. He would have vengeance somehow."   So, providing himself with a good-sized rod, he caught the old African by the arm, and struck furious blows about the shoulders. She cried and plead. But the mad man wanted vengeance, so he wreaked it upon the black woman. He whipped her until some of his friends less angry - albeit used to such sport - called upon him to desist, as Dinah was evidently innocent of any complicity in Bell's escape. Then, avowing his purpose to stay in the house himself that night, the friends and Dominie withdrew, and Colonel Mad- bury camped down on the sofa. While he had been overhauling Bell's room and closets, she had heard with her own ears his curses of rage and disappointment. How she rejoiced that she was safe from this base man, - that he was going to the front on the morrow. Maybe before he would return, Grant's army would take Richmond, and then she should be safe and free. Yes, Madbury had ransacked the house, but there was one spot he had not discovered. Nobody knew of it; nobody but "mamma." -Even Bell herself was surprised when this sure retreat was pointed out by the faithful old servant and friend. How she thanked her, in the sweet relief which had come to her despair- 21   242       VICTORY. ing heart. Ah, they were black hands which opened the unknown door, and liberated this girl from an approaching fate worse than death. Yes, they were black hands, but Bell knew no difference. In the life-time of Mrs. Winton, one of the female- servants having incurred in some way Mr. Winton's wrath, he promised her a severe flogging if she did not repent at the end of three days, and do his bid- ding. As usual, she told her grievances and fearful apprehensions to her mistress. Mrs. Winton had long felt the need of some hiding-place for the servants at such times as these, until the fury of their master's ire should pass by. In one of the chambers there was a large closet which with the space taken by the chim- ney occupied the entire end of the room. -The closet was an afterthought in the erection of the house, and took in a window which was not especially needed in the room, and the blinds of which were now always kept closed. Mrs. Winton told her husband there was danger of dampness to the clothing from this window, and he employed a carpenter to put a ceiling over the entire end of the closet. The window could not be removed, as it would mar the external appearance of the house. This ceiling had now been many years in its place, and had become a natural feature of the closet, which was used for the holiday apparel of master and mistress. Mrs. Winton thought it could be moved out a few inches, and not alter the closet very -per- ceptibly. She took those waiting three days for the accomplishment of this work. One of the slaves could use carpenter's tools, and he could be trusted too. So the ceiling was moved a little way, leaving   VICTORY    .      243 space next the wall for a person to stand or lie down. Its careful joints were made to swing on hinges out- wardly invisible, and thus a narrow door was con- structed, with secure fastenings high up among the hooks which sustained the clothing, and nowise dif- ferent in appearance from these. There were extra fastenings on the inside to be used by the one seeking safety in that narrow prison. Here the offending servant was hidden until Mr. Winton's ire passed by, and here Bell found safety until Madbury, too, passed out of the house and out of the city. {"Mamma" had furnished it with plenty of quilts and pillows, and with the sweet air from the open window she was very comfortable, and the night went by more pleas- antly to her than to the rich proprietor down in the parlor. When " mamma " assured her the siege was raised, she ventured out into her own room, but was careful not to show her face at the window. There were reporters constantly on hand, and she did not know but a Colonel could get a furlough at any minute, even though fighting at the front. All through that terrible summer she was a prisoner, not venturing even into the little garden for fear the guard would report her presence to Madbury. She walked the old rooms, she read, she wrote a little; mostly on a brief history of her own little eventful life. She got no news of how the battle raged, save such as she could glean from the Richmond papers, and-that made her sick at heart. The Rebels were victors in every encounter. And yet it looked a little singular, if that were really true, that they should fall back from the Rapidan to Petersburg. How she   244        VICTORY. longed for a scrap of reliable information. But there was none other than that obtainable from Rebel sources.. When she knew the whole army was gath- ered so near, her soul ,sunk within her in terror of Madbury's reappearance. He would get relieved, she knew he would, and come down to -look after the premises. Could she ever escape him again? It was July. An ambulance stopped at the door. "Mamma " gave the alarm. Bell sought her prison. Madbury had indeed come to take possession of the house. Soldiers and black servants were with him. They bore him through the hall on a stretcher. Then a bed was ordered down from the chambers and placed in one of the front parlors. Madbury had come in from that July battle to lie down awhile. One of his legs was gone, and a minnie bullet had shattered his shoulder. He would have to lie down for some time to come. Don't wonder at the way his body was torn. There were negroes in the fight, and two of them saw and knew him. They were not Sam nor Jupiter, though Samn and Jupiter had guns in their hands, and were there in front of Petersburg. But they were not the only sufferers at his base hands. There were others whom he had sold or robbed of wife or child; nmen who did not remember what was written in the Bible in the old hut at home; men who could not read, save the primal laws of human nature which tell of self-defence, and whisper vengeance on the offender. They were there unrestrained by any Yankee Captain with his hand upon their gun-locks, repeating in their ears nobler sentiments than ven- geance; they were in battle, and they fought well,   VICTORY.         245 and these took aim. And God above looked down upon their work, and called them the instruments of his vengeance. So Madbury, the slavedealer, torn with shot and minnie ball, lay down in the Winton parlor, and the surgeon gave his orders to the waiting-servants, how they should manage the wounded man. Bell moved about as usual, only taking pains to avoid contact with his servants, and he did not know she was there. A great question was knocking for answer at the door of her heart. "Should she go down and help take care of this man?" "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink." She remembered these words of our Lord. But Madbury had care; he did not suffer for that. Waiting hands bore all necessary help to his weakness.  Should she go? She remembered how  "mamma " had come to her a week before, with tears and terror, saying their supplies were exhausted, and there was no more money. She knew nothing of want, and the sudden presence of the awful spectre appalled her. They had been living on the fruit and vegetables of the garden alone for a week.  Now Madbury had come, the house was furnished with stores, and she shared them unknown'to him. Had he not saved her from starvation? True, she had a plan of trying to pawn the silver and her watch, but there was little hope of success in that, where bread was so dear, and Davis paper good for nothing. If there had been a mint where the metal could be turned into coin, her hope might have brightened a little. As it was, the gaunt 21*   246       VICTORY. spectre haunted her continually; adding its horrid companionship to the plethoric presence she had feared so intensely, and which had come back a broken and sunken thing. Yes; but the one had dispelled the other. Was she not a debtor? She would watch awhile. If Madbury languished long, she would go to his aid. If he rallied soon, she would keep her shelter. How. the guns boomed at Petersburg! Maybe they would storm this Sebastopol soon I God grant they may, before this smitten man gathers his *strength again.   -CHAAPTER-  XXII. Gi od's ways seem dark, but soon or late They touch the shining hills of day; The evil cannot brook delay, The good can well afford to wait." OW patiently they wait in the trenches; days, weeks, monthsI How they watch the move- ments of the wily foe! How they creep to avoid his sharpshooters. "Twelve of our men lie dead out- side; and we cannot lift our heads, or stir to bury them till nightfall," -writes one, who waited in the trenches, under the Rebel guns at Petersburg. What Colonel Watts wrote of his vigilant soldiers, could be said with truth in every regiment occupying the advance. The men were picked off daily,- lay dead outside, and the head lifted to look after the fallen heroes, fell, too, a martyr with the rest. And so the days went on. They were days of fearful loss, and anxious watching. The hot Virginia sun smote our Northern boys, and sickness seized them, and they wasted away. The screaming shells burst in the protecting rifle-pits, and they fell shattered, wounded, dead. We who looked on from afar, cried out in (247)   248       VICTORY. agony of soul, " O God, the fearful sacrifice I How longI O, how  long!" Then with tear-washed eyes, we saw Liberty in peril, and these brave men, lying down in welcome death, to save her from the hand of the destroyer. We hid our faces in awe and wonder at the sight. "Is not man more than man, that he can thus give himself, to save a great cause?" we said. "See him wait and watch in the airless trenches I See him go face to face with the wide-mouthed cannon! See him hurl his breast against that steel-pointed wall I  Yes, man is more than man in these perils. He is a hero. A patriot. A defender of Liberty. Super- human courage stirs him, as he thinks of the momen- tous issues at stake. Superhuman strength nerves his arm, as he remembers how a world waits for liberty. The courage and strength of a soul which despises physical pain, knowing its own fair beauty cannot be marred by the passage of shell or sabre, speaks its native tongue, in deeds like these. The soul is man. Do not call flesh and blood, man. No, the courage and strength of this noble army, facing the foe in miles and miles of battle, in months and months of waiting, is MANLY courage. It is not super- human. The highest title in life is the one word man. Hero, patriot, martyr I Ah, man is all of these I I wish I could' dip my pen in the fire which burns upon the altar of my heart, and paint for you the wreaths of continual incense, -the thanksgivings and hallelujahs, which go out to our noble army. But you, too, feel all this fine sense of the great work they are doing for us and for the world. And you   VICTORY.         249 bless them daily while they wait, and watch, and battle. Colonel Watts sees the autumn leaves begin to fall, and yet the Rebels hold the works over there, - and O, the prisoners! Terrible is the thought of the ghastly men, whose faces had become too familiar. This hot, dusty summer would bring the welcome summons to many a one he had left in Danville. But they were men, and would meet death bravely. When these pale victims haunted him with their hungry faces,- there looked out from among them a girl he had known, - then fair and brilliant, now thin and wan. True, she was not in any of the prison pens of the South, but her prison-keeper was more to be dreaded than any Dick Turner. He knew how she had risked life to escape him, and was in his power at last, without the smallest chance of escape. What could a lone Union girl do in that city of Rebels? She would not know a sympathizing friend in all the city. She must stand alone with a slavedealer hold- ing the keys of the house that sheltered her. Ah, maybe worse than that! though he knew if it were possible for her to escape impending fate, she would never be Madbury's wife. Maybe she would die first. Who knew? .She was a strong and determined girl. Autumnhpasses, and the Winter winds howl, and the snow comes in gusts about the damp trenches, and still the army watches and waits. Day by day, they are gathering strength for the decisive conflict. They wait not idly or uselessly, but the waiting is hard to endure, nevertheless. No harm can come to Liberty, because the Rebel batteries still frown in front.   250       VICTORY. "We shall conquer in the end," says the Colonel, "but evil may happen to the pale faces in prison. The dead will be fearfully more, - and one in that solitary Richmond 'prison nray endure a living death." But there was no help. The ponderous army could not hasten to the rescue of a single soul. It was mar- shalled to rescue liberty, and every movement, and all its patient waiting had this single aim. "I will go and see Jupiter, and tell him the news," said the Colonel, as he laid down the paper he had been reading. He found him sitting in a little circle of friends, members of the same regiment, and their aniqrated faces showed the approaching Colonel that some pleasant subject was under discussion. The moment Jupiter saw his old friend, he arose and met him with extended hands. "It is glorious, Colonel Watts, what they have done in Washington!" "What have they done, Jupiter?" "Why, have you not heard? Amended the Con- stitution in favor of freedom." "Yes, it is glorious. I came to tell you the good news, but it seems you have got the start of me." "Just read it, Colonel, and we were talking about the great blessing it will be to our people. Our wives and children can no longer be sold on the auction- block. Madbury's business will be up with now. O, if it had always been a free Constitution I " "Let us. be glad it is made such, even late. I know you have suffered, Jupiter. But let us be full of hope now." "This is Colonel Watts, Dick," said Jupiter. And   VICTORY.         251 turning to the Colonel, he remarked-, - Dick heard me call your name the other day, and inquired if you had ever been in Libby. I told him you had. That was the way I come to know you, and get my free- dom so early,--bless the Lord. He said his mis- tress, Bell Winton, nursed a Yankee by that name, and I thought you might like to know him." "I'm glad to see you, Dick. Then it was your clothes that Miss Bell ran away in. I wish she had some safe disguise now." "She is safe, Colonel, in Newherne. We hold that port, you know." "No. She is in Richmond,-went there last spring to watch by her father's dying bed, and AMadbury put a guard round the house, and keeps her still, if she lives." "Is old massa clear gone? ' "He is dead." "And Miss Bell shut up in the old house?" "Yes." "Well, I rather guess Madbury is shut up too, so she wont have him to pester her." "How Dick?" - "I seen a couple of darkies takin' aim at him, and I seen him tumble too. Guess he's dead enough." "Do you know Madbury, Dick?" "You knows I come from    Richmond, Jupiter. Aint a nigger in forty miles that don't know old Mad- bury. But he's done for now." "Do you believe he's dead I " "I knows I seen him tumble, and men takin' him offs"   252       VICTORY. "The ealth is rid of a curse then," said Jupiter. The Colonel breathed somewhat freer. His patience took a new lease. Not that he rejoiced in the death of any man; but he was glad to know that Miss Winton had escaped this peril; and he believed that God is just. "How is it, Colonel, about this amendment, does it make citizens of us?" "d It makes freemen of you, Jupiter, and there ought to be nothing in the way of full citizenship to a freeman in the American Republic." "But you think there will be?" "I think there will be discussion about the elective franchise; of course men will differ as to the right of the negro to the ballot. But I have no doubt of the result. The good sense of the people will guide them to a correct decision." "You think we should have the ballot, Colonel?" "I do, most certainly. All our freemen should have a voice in making the nation's laws." "I have been thinking about this a good deal. The President's Proclamation gives freedom to my race wherever the flag is borne by the Union armies. And now this amendment comes to sanction his word and make it secure. But when the war ends, what shall we have to protect us in our freedom?" "Nothing safe, unless you have the ballot." "The Rebels are old in oppression of my people. They will find ways to exercise the master's will, even though they can no longer buy and sell us." "You must be made full citizens, Jupiter, as Isoon as the closing war leaves time for legislation upon this all-important subject."   VICTORY.         253 - "It seems to me if we are worthy to fight to main- tain law and order, we should be allowed to call this our country when order is restored." "That is true, Jupiter. And I am sure you will be. This nation is not at heart unjust. The few alone have perpetuated injustice among us. The heart of the people beats time to liberty, and these heart-beats shall speak in law, for the preservation of all which is meant by the arms which are in your hands." "We are the only loyal people in the South, Colonel." "I know you are. And you have come through much tribulation at the call of freedom to help us fight this battle. Don't lose hope, my dear fellow. We shall conquer not only the Rebels in arms, but the prejudices of Rebel sympathizers too." "I believe we shall conquer the Rebels in arms. But the prejudice against our black, faces, - shall we ever conquer that?" "By your devotion to the flag and the heroism with which you have defended it, you shall conquer even that. You have conquered it already in all right- minded and worthy people." "If all were like you, Colonel, my fears -for the future of my people would be lightened a little. But perhaps I should not forebode ill when so much has been gained." "We have progressed wonderfully as a nation in our sense of -right, and justice. The war has called us to think seriously on the awful oppression of your race. Think of the rapid strides we have taken since that first Rebel gun knocked away our apathy and 22   254       VICTORY. careless repose; the President's Proclamation, the arms in your hands, the free constitutions in States long Slave States, and now this glorious amendment I Why, Jupiter, there need not be the shadow of a fear for the future, if we continue to grow in grace as we have since the war." {"You will pardon me if I have seemed over anxious, Colonel. You know I am not a white man, whose rights none question." "I know all about your peculiar position,my dear fellow, and your anxiety is not unnatural, but take heart from our progress as a nation, and the auspicious tendency of the times. I must leave you now, Jupiter. I suppose we must measure swords with the Rebels before long, and I think the next battle will be decisive." "The Lord grant it may." The Colonel extended his congratulations to the little circle who had sat mute listeners, telling them it was a great gain, this amendment, - and -rode away. His thoughts dwelt for some time upon the great and absorbing question which they had talked about. He could see how a thinker like Jupiter, should desire a more secure future, than even this glorious amend- ment provided for his people. But he was true himself, and he made no doubt but every right of free- men would be accorded to the negro, when once the people thought and acted in that direction. Gradually his reflections took another channel. "Dick said he saw Madbury fall." He had felt a sense as of a lifted burden at the sudden news. Now he pondered a little over it. Miss Winton might not be   VICTORY.         255 free after all.- Not every one who falls in battle, falls dead. The greater number are wounded. It is no proof of death to see a man fall. If wounded, Mad- bury would go to Richmond, -maybe to the Winton house, as that was his now, and Bell would be obliged to see him, perhaps take care of him. -He would get well, - and then -" He had not inquired when Dick saw him fall, whether recently or not. He turned to go back. No -that would look as though he was very anxious about something. He would not go back. But if he fell during the summer battles, by this time his wounds would be healed. Before the Colonel arrived at his post, his heart had touched zero. His patience was slipping away; and a girl's face continued to haunt him with the rest of the prison faces. Do you wonder? The girl who saved his life was in peril. You would feel as he did if you have any gratitude. He was not getting, morbid, - but a year of watching will wear the best soldier. It was almost a year since Mrs. Denton had told him this thing. Cheer up, my soldier! the day of victory is near. No great work is easily or quickly done. Look how the lines are converging I The Lieut.-General is slowly, but surely, drawing them in. Sherman, the invincible leader, who has led his men through the very heart of the rebellious South, is coming yonder. Don't you almost hear the steady tramp of his veterans as they pacethat State over which you took yournight marches I Noble soldier I Hew the heart of the North pours out its love and benedictions as it follows him on that   256        v I T O VICTORY. long, dangerous, but ever victorious march! Noble army I Intrepid followers of an intrepid leader, how the soft hands of loving gratitude weave garlands of laurel for each living or sleeping patriot head I God knows how I Down the Virginia valleys, nearer and nearer rides Sheridan towards the rebellious Capital. His name means victory wherever it is spoken. Even flying defeat acknowledges its power and turns instantly to face the battle. His men are brave and dauntless like himself. The hoofs of their steeds leave fiery paths behind them wherever they go. Even the horses are veteran warriors. And yonder is Thomas, the calm, steady, determined General, --always a wise and safe leader. Always in the right place at the right time. Richmond and Petersburg are dangerous places just now. Those frowning batteries which this long waiting has made so terrible, are gathering black- ness for the storm. Buckle on your armor, my patient braves. Not much more watching around these Rebel defences. The hour of victory is near.   --- CHAPTER - -  XXIII. "The unquailing eye of innocence Alone upon the oppressor turning I " ADBURY did not rally. The warm weather was hard upon him. Then his plethoric body was not made up of the best' sort of flesh and blood. The wounds did not heal well. Too much whiskey circulated in his veins. That was the trouble. He had every care which 'money could purchase. The surgeon attended him almost constantly, but he grew very weak, and was feverish withal, and they thought he would die. He began to think so himself, and that did not help his condition any. In fact the thought brought with it some tortures, - though for the most part this man's conscience was callous. Just a little life left in it, --that was all. 'Twas a bad thing for him to be called to give -up the world. That was all he had. He would be poorer than the meanest negro. then. Fortunately that race has some interest in the world to come. They have had no chance to fill up earthly treasuries for themselves, so they have laid up their treasures in heaven. Madbury had not troubled his head with anything beyond the bounds of time. He did not think there was anything beyond, --had 22*   (257)   258       vIcTorTr. not thought so, when he was well, and able to swing the lash and rivet the chain. Now he lay helpless in the arms of fate, he began to be afraid there was some after-life. What would become of him if there was. He could not take his gold with him, and buy a high seat there. And then maybe if there is an im- mortality, negroes will share it too. Would he be safe if his victims should get hold of him. Look at what two of them had done already. Shot off his leg and shattered his shoulder. There would not be guns there maybe, but if all he had sold, and gagged, and whipped, and tortured in various ways, should get hold of him, - O, he hoped there wasn't any future I Bell was informed of his condition daily, and when they told her the surgeon had given him up, thought she would go to him. She should feel better after he was dead, if she helped smooth the rough way for the pas- sage of this transgressor. Maybe she could shed some light into his dark soul, and make it easier for him to die. Then she was tired of the close confine- ment, and the stived chambers. She could have the liberty of the whole house and garden if she went boldly down stairs and turned helper in this emergency. She had grown pale and thin. The vision which came to the Colonel, was not a counterfeit but real vision. So she went down stairs. "I Mamma" said it would be but a few days at most, that the man would need care, and maybe the presence of some other than the black servants might take away some of the thorns which she knew pierced him. Madbury thought she had risen from the dead and come to torment him before his time, but as she went   VICTORY.         259 noiselessly about the room arranging the pillows and wetting his parched lips, he found that torment was no part of her purpose. He was too weak to ask any questions, but he came to the secret conclusion that there must be friends of Bell in the city, who had secreted her all this long time. He thought she had repented it all, now she knew he was wounded and perhaps dying, and the thought lent him a little strength. O, if he could get well, and live in this old house with a wife whose fine points would be the admiration of all his friends, how grand he should feel about it. Maybe President Davis would give him some especial mark of honor in consequence. He admired handsome women. On Bell's appearance, Madbury's thoughts took a new turn. They clutched around the old idols,- wealth and ambition, -and no longer lingered fear- fully on the shores of a doubtful future. He felt that there was a chance for him yet. The water she brought him allayed somewhat the fever. It was better than the surgeon's wine, better for him who had drank so much wine. In a few days he had given up all thought of dying, and was struggling for life and a stronger hold of his treasures which had seemed to be slipping away. The weather was growing cooler. That helped him. But most of all he was helped by the determination to live which seized him when he caught sight of this beautiful girl. The surgeon saw the change and told him the crisis was passed, and he was now convalescent. He thought it a marvel that he should rally, but he did not know Madbury thoroughly. Bell saw the change, too.   260       VICTORY. Well, she was willing he should live. She thought he had some sins which it were better to repent of before he took that mysterious journey. But, how long should she stay about him, fixing his pillows and wetting his lips? She would stay while she could, she was safe. It was slow work, but Madbury was surely gaining each day. He had begun to think of a wooden leg. He should want one as soon as he was able to stand up. He must make sure his claim upon Bell Winton, and not let her slip out of the house again. The leg was ordered, - not a Palmer, - but as good a leg as could be whittled out in Richmond. He tried sitting in a rocking-chair first, and stayed in it a whole hour. When he could sit up Bell kept out of the room, only coming in occasionally to inquire after him. He noticed this and asked what it was for. ",You do not need me now, 5Mr. Madbury," was her answer. Madbury had a relapse, or feigned to have. He did not sit up again for a month. Bell came in often, but saw no symptoms of fever or serious sickness. He did not need any very tender care, in bearing his drink or medicine. She felt sure he was shamming, but she could watch the hawk. She was glad he kept his bed, and did not attempt to buckle on that ponderous wooden leg, which adorned the corner of the room. She did not know but he could run with it, the first time trying. She did not know much about wooden legs. The time went by, and every day, though it was very long, brought the future nearer. It could not be   VICTORY.         261 much darker than the past. It might be brighter; so thought Bell, as she watched anxiously the passing days. Sometimes she heard Madbury and the sur- geon talk about the war. Their words had the old bluster in them, but there was an undertone of fear which was not formerly there. She learned from them, something of what the Union army was doing. Sherman must have overcome all obstacles, to get on so. She heard them speak of his whereabouts, and they spoke of him as a terror to the South. Grant still lay around Petersburg. Theyhad not dislodged him, though they had made furious efforts in that direction. Sheridan had broken the railroads, and made terrible havoc in Virginia. These things she gathered, some from the papers, but more- from the half desponding men. She caught hope from them. She knew they averred Richmond could never be taken, but they were too loud in asserting it. That meant doubt and fear. Madbury was gaining. The winter was going. She wished the Union arms would strike quickly. One day he was sitting up in his chair, and he had certainly put on the wooden leg. It had left its place in the corner. "I have walked across the room, Bell," said he. I think I can stand now for the ceremony, and we will wait no longer. You will feel freer to take care of me, after we are married." "I wonder you have waited so long as you have, Mr. Madbury." "I wanted to wait until I could wear my leg. H did not like to mortify so beautiful a woman, by ask- ing her to marry a, man who could not stand."   2(;2       V IC T O r Y. "O, that is it. You were very kind. When will the ceremony take place?" "I have asked the surgeon to bring Mr. Robes next time he comes in." "When will he come in?" "Perhaps this afternoon. O Bell, I think I shall be very happy, notwithstanding I have lost my leg. You are a very beautiful girl, Bell." ' Thank you, sir. That sounds nice." "Come and sit down by me, and let us talk about it." "I must run and get ready. I must array myself in my most gorgeous robes, and it will take me some time, with ' mamma's ' slow help." "Well, go Bell, dear, we can talk afterwards,"' and Bell went. Madbury thought the coast was clear now, - no more breakers. He imagrined the girl had fallen in love with him, while she had wet his lips, and ar- ranged his pillows. She was willing, now, to marry him. It was so much better to have her consent, especially now, when he was not very strong. If he had been the Madbury of old, he would not have cared whether she was willing or not. His own will, backed by his strong- right arm, would have done as lhe pleased with the girl. He knew how to rule. He had learned that in his elegant life pursuit. If he could get hold of the girl's hand, he would defy her to get away until after the ceremony, and then she w- his for life. But there would be no force needed now, and he rested back in his rocking-chair, expecting every   VICTOn  Y.        2603 minute to see Bell in the gorgeous wedding robes, she had spoken of, coming into his presence, even before the priest arrived, and sitting down meekly at his feet, very thankful, no doubt, that he had con- descended to renew his suit. The surgeon came in with Rev. Mr. Robes. lMad- bury was .balanced a few times, to make sure he could stand, and then word was sent to Bell, that all things were ready. She did not make her appearance. Madbury was not impatient. He thought she had not had time to put on the gorgeous robes; - the min- ister had come rather early. The three men talked of the war. Things looked ominous, they said. They could not meet the tremen- dous preparations of the Yankees, or resist much longer the cords which were tightening around them; so thought the two who heard the outside rumbling, and undertone. MSadbury was uneasy. He thought the President would devise some means to beat back the Yankee tide which pressed higher and nearer. "He could arm the negroes,--man the defences with them." i Ah, but there is no time to teach them the use of arms now, and there are few strong ones near," said the Rev. Mr. Robes. "They could be daily drilled," said Madbury. "What is the strait that there is no time?" "Ah, the pestilent Yankees will attack us before we could teach the son of Ham to handle firearms." "How do we know that? They have been sitting still for months, and will for months longer. They are afraid to face our defences."   264       VICTORY, "Ah, they have not all been sitting still. You forget that pestilent Sherman. He is in North Caro- lina. And Sheridan seems to overmatch our horse- men, he goes everywhere:" V Well, well I What of it. They can't take Rich- mond. I know they can't. Hadn't you better remind the bride that time fies?" - turning to one of his servants. Phillis ran up to Bell's room, rapped at the door, and called. There was no answer, but she thought of course the girl heard, and went back to her station, by the parlor door. Rev. hMr. Robes tried to talk about the war. Mad- bury stopped him. He was growing impatient, now. "Perhaps Miss Winton waits an escort. Will the surgeon do me the honor to lend his arm, as I have not the full use of my leg yet?" "I don't think you could climb the stairs, Madbury, even with the heD of my arm." "You misunderstand me. I desire you to escort Miss Winton into the parlor." "I will do that with pleasure," said. the surgeon, who had not been blind to the fact of Bell's frequent presence, or the freshness and beauty which she brought into the sick-room; and with Phillis for a guide, he proceeded to the chamber. A warning rap upon the door brought no response, and the surgeon opened it, and went in. There was no appearance of bride or bridal array about the room. Everything was in order, as though it was an unused guest-chamber he had entered. He th'ought there must be some   VICTORY.         265 mistake, and calling Phillis, inquired if she had not shown him 'to the wrong room. "Dat ar de one I allers t'ink Miss Bell's, dar's whar I rap jes now." "' Call the old house servant. I think there must be some mistake." "Mamma " came up, and- declared that to be "Miss Bell's room, sure.' "But she is not here," said the surgeon. "What for you want her," inquired "mamma." "Why to be married to Colonel Madbury; I sup- posed everybody in the house knew that." "Mamma " put on a face of mysterious awe. "It am wonerful I wonerful I Mr. Doctor. Ebery time Madbury want to marry Bell, she am missin', and nobody can't find whar she gone. Two times fore dis day, Massa Madbury come to marry Miss Bell, and when he want her, she am nowhar. De fust time we nebber seen her for more'n two year. Den when Massa Winton dyin' she come right in jes as ef nothin' had happen, and nobody know whar she come from. An' de odder time she disappear, nobody seen her 'tall. An' one day she jes come in whar Massa Madbury lie wid his leg off, an' go round jes like live folks. But she aint. I t'ink dere am no Miss Bell in dis world. She gone dead tree years an' more." "Nonsense i I've seen her. There's no dead woman about her."  "Nuffin' but a ghost could disappear dis way." "Folly I She's helped off, either by friends in the house or out of it." 23   266       VICTORY. "Nobody here help her. An' poor ole " mamma" seen nobody comin' round nudder, 'cept de guard." "Are you sure she is not in some other room? She may be a little sick, or have fallen asleep." "hMassa doctor can look. Dar am de doors.' "dMassa Doctor" looked, and then went down stairs, but no bride in gorgeous robes hung upon his arm. If the old priest had not been constantly under Mad- bury's eye, he would have thought the surgeon had slipped out and married her himself, he was. gone so long. When he heard footsteps on the stairs, he arose with Dominie's help, and balanced himself on the new leg which he had not quite got the hang of yet. He was standing with his face towards the hall door. The surgeon made his appearance alone. "It is very singular, Colonel, but Miss Winton is not in the chamber, and the old house servant says she has a fashion of disappearing mysteriously." The Colonel got off his balance and settled down in his chair. It was mysterious how she got away, and the house guarded. He began to partake a little of old " mamma's" pretended ghost notions. He did not know what a ghost might do in case of necessity. He did not rave. he was just a little awed. He remembered how he had hunted once, and cross-ques- tioned the guard, and thrashed Dinah, and afterwards had seen Miss Winton walk into his sick-room as though she was entirely at home and always had been. Maybe she had the power of rendering herself invisi- ble. It was very singular indeed. The guard were trusty fellows, picked men, and all of them in his   VICTOR Y.         267 interest. They would not let her pass if they saw her. Madbury had been very sick. A year ago he would have spurned any such ghost notions, as the nonsense  of ignorant " niggers."  Now he untied his leg and lay down, thinkingc all sorts of improbable. fhings. Dominie came forward to console him, but he did not want anything said. "You can go, Mr. Robes, your services will not be needed,"-and Mr. Robes went. So did the surgeon, and his pert little head was full of imaginary reasons for Miss Winton's disappearance. "Certainly, certainly. Madbury's old, not hand- some either; " and he smoothed his face with the palm of his hand; " rich to be sure, but Miss Winton might not care for that. Yes, she looked very much pleased, interested, in fact. I wonder I did not think- of it before. That is the secret; " and the surgeon tossed his pert little head as he walked, as though his recol- lections were very gratifying. Yes, Miss Winton did look pleased and interested when you talked about the success of the Union army, and the probability of a speedy attack upon the de- fences around Petersburg.   XXIV. "Sound for the onset I blast on blast I Till Slavery's minions cower and quail; One charge of fire shall drive them fast, Like chaff before our Northern gale I " ROM the first of the war, the impression had prevailed at the North, that the final battle would be fought in the vicinity of Richmond. When our little army went out from the shadow of the Cap- ital, in the summer of 1861, the watchword along the lines was "On to Richmond." It was quite natural to look in the direction of the spot where the Davis Congress had assembled, as the place of final reckon- ing with that defiant spirit which had taken on the iron front of war. The Capital of a real or fictitious nation may be considered the seat of power. The Rebels guarded Richmond with all vigilance, and left nothing lacking which could add to the safety of their assumed Capital. Seven distinct lines of fortifications, heavily manned with frowning cannon, girded the heart of the Rebellion. Davis, sitting in the uneasy chair of the usurper, felt a sense of temporal security as he thought of the impregnable defences of the city. His warriors were dauntless men, and fought with a persist- ence which, in a righteous cause, would have crowned (268)   VICTORY.         269 them with immortal honor. We had learned since that fatal Sunday when the battle of Bull Run so shocked the nation, that the foe we had to deal with was not weak in determination or valor. It had long ago become plain to the North, that the war could not end in -' ninety days." So the giant Freedom roused at last to adequate, preparations, took in the vastness of the work to be done, and went about that work in a calm and sensible manner. Our-Navy, hardly worth the name-in the beginning of the war, rapidly multiplied its power, and stretched its sails to catch the helpful winds, until nearly every Southern port was opened for the free use of the North, or closed effectively to open aid which some neighbor might in tender " neutrality" desire to extend to the "belligerent"Americans. If any cousin over the way wanted to send guns or shoes to General Lee's army, he was obliged to take the risk of running the blockade.. It is whispered that a good many Captains were found, who were ,willing to take the risk, but I expect they watched for foggy nights, in which our noble sailors could not see them. No- body shall blame the guardian ships which stood so long as sentinels on the outer passes. Every Captain and marine who walked their sunny or icy decks, proved himself a hero in his watchfulness, and doubly a hero when the call "to the guns " gave him work instead of watching. General Grant, sitting with his cigar as sole com- panion, in the little tent which the soldiers called "headquarters," and looking over the vast field of his plans, saw that the port of Wilmington would be   270        VICTORY. in better hands, if possessed by Union forces. It would be stopping a gap where some mischievous pig, albeit a dead one, might find ingress. So he sent the requisite ships and men, and took possession of the port. All these side scenes of conflict and terror had to be planned and executed before the 'waiting army of the Potomac found its hour to strike. They were all steps in the march towards Richmond, where the greatest Rebel guard concentrated, and where the country looked with anxious heart for the impendino storm. We knew that it must come. And though full of hope that the results would be all we could ask, we trembled in thought of the awful cost. Our boys would be swept down amid the rage and roar of battle!  Ah, this thought made us watch the steps of preparation with fear and trembling, as the low, sad undertone of hope.  We longed fobr the end, and yet lived in daily dread of the agony which lay in the way of its coming. The sudden attack upon Fort Steadman, by the Rebel Gordon's corps of' three divisions, at first so successful, but which Yankee valor changed into victory on the Union side, caused us to become more watchful than ever for the beginning of the end. The enemy were in desperate straits, and our army must not wait long for more perfect preparation. That charge resulted in a day of battle. After a stubborn conflict and severe loss, the Rebels were driven from the Fort and back to their own lines, leaving all the guns they had captured, and seventeen hundred of their soldiers as prisoners. But there was fierce fighting along the whole line,   VICTOR Y.         271 charge after charge of Union and Rebel troops with varying success. At night-fall, however, General Meade could say, 't The result of the day was the thorough defeat of the enemy's plans ; the capture of the strongly intrenched line under the artillery fire of his main works, and the capture of ten battle-flags and two thousand eight hundred prisoners.' Four days afterwards, on the 29th of March, the whole army of the Potomac was girded for battle. Grant, the "Great Captain," surveyed the whole area of his mighty plan and saw that the auspicious hour had come. The converging lines had reached exactly the desirable positions. With his master hand he could guide them at will. He gave the order and his army made it act in march and battle. Leaving the Sixth and Ninth corps to hold the line around Petersburg, and of other troops only enough to garrison our positions, the army made again the attempt to .take the Southside railroad. Over this road the Rebels now received their supplies. To take it might shut them in, and save perhaps the terrible slaughter of a direct attack upon the enemy's main works. But the position which cut off the lRebel army from its last hope of life was not to be won with the ease with which the historian writes of the achieve- ment. Four days of severe fighting with changing gain and awful loss, were the costly price we must pay for even an opening to this coveted position. Foot and horse fought together in the closing strife. "Smash them!" said the fiery  Sheridan. "We have a record to make before that sun goes down. I want the Southside railroad!" He urged his men to   272       VICTORY. deeds of noblest daring, inspiring them by his own fearless spirit to forget personal danger, and think only of the great cause of which they were the bul- wark and defence. They pressed on like an avalanche into the face of the defiant foe. Nothing of battle armor hurled against them, daunted the brave men. There should be no failure in the attempted work. This time success should crown invincible daring. He who turned the tide of battle in the Shenandoah, when he " rode from Winchester twenty miles away," was thrilling each soldier with something of his own determined soul, which knew no such word as defeat. At length, by the united and persistent blows of foot and horsemen, the Rebels were turned back. The Southside road was gained. And the "record" of Sheridan's valor in that fierce battle is one of which the American heart is justly proud. General Grant heard these tidings from the advanc- ing forces. The lines around Petersburg opened fire. The bombardment was terrific. The Rebel defence stubborn and persistent. But the iron-hearted Ninth corps, which had fought so many desperate battles, was confronting them, and among the Colonels, the gleaming sword of my hero, doing its ready service. Whether counted among the world's heroes or not, it mattered nought to him; he was one of liberty's defenders, and utterly fearless of death. The heart of the Rebellion grew faint as the grasp which held it tightened continually. But despair shotted their guns, long after hope was dead. How the battle raged and roared I "O, the booming, bellowing guns! O, the gory heaps of the slain!"   VICTORY.          273 The men who had waited. almost a year- in damp trenches were determined that this fight should be the last. If the lines of Rebel fortifications had been seventy instead of seven, these fearless soldiers would have breasted them as bravely.' They stood firm; they kept the wide-mouthed cannon hot with incessant fire, they were swift and ready with rifle and sword. The storm of shot and shell which poured from the Rebel ramparts, though it mowed them  down like grass, caused no tremor of terror in the living. Night and day, along miles of distance, the battle raged, each soldier striving to strike his sturdiest blows that the longed-for end might come, - and then at last,- "Through the thickening April twilight Wide apart thebattle rolled, In its sheath the sabre rested, And the cannon's lips grew cold!" Thousands of men had fallen; sealing their devo- tion to liberty with that dearest gift, a human life. So terrible had been the conflict, it was a marvel to the living that so many were spared. As night gathered and Colonel Watts had time for reflection, he wondered how the bullets could have missed him, in the near and awful onsets where his sword had gleamed that day. But I think He who counts our hairs knows how. Some-must be spared. The Lord does not require the sacrifice of all our braves. "What of Italy free, if we have not a son "   v    CHAPTER XXV. "Not as we hoped; -but what are we? Above our broken dreams and plans God lays, with wiser hand than man's, The corner-stones of liberty." ICTORY at last!    Don't you hear the bells? That is what they say in the towers of ten thousand Northern churches. Victory! -Don't you hear the cannon boom? That is the glorious word they utter with their iron throats. See the starry banner float and flutter on the spring air I It is thicker everywhere, than it was four years ago, when the men of the North said it should rise from the dust and float over every fortress in the land, - even the for- tress from which Rebels had shot it down, - and every State and great city and smallest town, should see' and honor it. It is floating now as they promised, and Sumter only awaits the anniversary of disaster, to fling out again the victorious banner. The Hebel army have abandoned the defences around Petersburg. They are flying, and our steely blue columns are after them. Richmond the Capital of treason, bows her (274)   VICTOnY.         275 haughty, ambitious head, and the flag of freedom floats over her. Let the bells ring. Let the cannon boom. Let the banner float and flutter. Our great agony is lifting a little. Peace is near, thank God. We have watched and waited long. We have wept tears of blood. We have plead in agony for the hour of sacri- fice to pass by. Our prayers have reached the bending ear of Mercy. We will sit down in the stillest corner of the house, and bow our heads. Joy born of such travail must be silent till the great waves have swept by a little. Let them ring the bells and fire the guns, who have not watched at the silent door of the prison for weary months, and yet no answer, -no return to him whose hope died out when he saw the gaunt faces within the walls. Let them ripg the bells and fire the guns, who have not waited for weary months with the soldier beloved in the comfortless trenches, or followed him through long marches to the wide door of a war-grave at last, before victory could come to us. Such as these, and they are many ten thousand, will listen to the voices of triumph, full of joy that the great cause which was worthy such precious sacrifices has come out of the battle victorious, but they will listen in silence and tears. Did you miss me, O patriot, when you came in swinging your hat with the gay "hurrah " upon your lips? You did not search the stillest corner of the house. We have all suffered, -all! But some ofus more than others. Yet do not think they are less thankful for victory who make no hurrahs. A little later, and General Lee's flying army had surrendered. Then, for the first time through all the   276       VICTORY. long struggle, I bought a flag and put it in my window. I could see the end now. Victory seemed complete. I would put up the banner of liberty now that liberty had come. It would mean all it said. Was there ever in the world such deep joy as swept the heart of the North on that day, when it heard that surrender. of the lordliest Rebel host, had been made to General Grant? It was one day in a thousand years. Few lives have ever known such an extremity of exalta- tion as that day brought to the men and women of our time. It were vain to seek for comparisons. It was beyond all compare, the gladdest day a great people ever knew. It meant so much to our waiting hearts! Liberty and peace, and all the promises of rescue to the oppressed of all lands, were grouped together, and we looked upon them as sure and near. We had been wasted and stricken, and bowed with anguish. We would rise up and build and plant, and be glad and thankful to God. The new days would be so much better than the old I There would be no more clanking chains under our blue sky, and the blue field of our waving banner. We had suffered terribly, but there were compensations. Not vain had been the loss, if a race were thereby saved. O, it was a day in which the agony of years was rolled back like a cloud, and the sun shone full upon us. We went about with lightened countenances, thinking of the redeemed Republic. We were past the rocks now. Our Captain knew the calm sea of peace into which he had safely guided us. There was nothing more to fear. He would do right. He believed in humanity. We were full of joy. Full of trust.   VICTORY.         2" They went down to Charleston to lift the old flag to its place upon the battered walls of Sumter. It would be a great day. Just four years ago Major Anderson and his brave fellows were obliged to take it down before the- threatening guns of Rebellion. Now it would be raised again amid the peans of victory which a redeemed nation was singing. One was there who knew how to fit his words to the occa- sion. One who has worn the priest's mitre so aloft,- so head and shoulders above his brother priests,- that the whole land with united voice proclaims him High Priest for this great jubilee. He is orator at Sumter. None other had earned the honored place. Not that the clergy are not true and loyal. They are. They have spoken true words and done noble deeds, and many of them have died for the flag. The land is indebted to their valor very largely. They have been a great power in- its redemption. They have been faithful to their convictions from first to last, though old friendships were broken by their fidelity, and familiar and beloved faces were missing on Sun- day. They have been true and uncompromising, though they were driven away as outcasts by Rebel sympathizers in power, and obliged to seek other fields, or other duties, till the mad spirit of the hour should die. But he has been preeminent for his de- fence of the cause of freedom. He espoused it long ago, and is an old warrior. He has defended the truth so fearlessly and long, that Plymouth Church, like Plymouth Rock, is but another name for freedom and independence. None so well as he could speak the word at Sumter. 24   278        V IC TO Y, The flag rose proudly to its place. The orator poured out his buruing eloquence. The throng lis- tened rapt, awed. The great glad day went by, and night gathered over the land. We slept securely and dreamed of victory and peace. Morning came and we went about our cares. I do not think we felt the shadow of any gathering ill. No, it came upon us suddenly. The lightning bore it; there was no noise of thunder, but our hearts were smitten as with the great shock of an earthquake. Our joy was turned into mourning. Our melody into a desolate wail. There were muffled sounds upon the air. Men and women went by with bowed heads. The bells in all the steeples tolled. Flags hung at half-mast, and they were wrapped in crape. I think for the time, I was stunned. It seemed we had lost all. Who, like Abraham Lincoln could guide this great people I And he was dead. They had shot him, as he sat at ease, thinking of peace and victory. "Who shot him?" Rebellion shot him. Treason shot him! Ah, Slavery shot him. We had conquered the arms of the mon- ster, but its spirit was still defiant. Victory had come, and yet it had not come. The battle of bullets was over, but another battle more perilous awaited the patriot's voice and pen. O, ominous day I How darkly the hours went by. From morning until night the heavy tolling bells spoke the woe of a great people. The faithful man had been taken away. The tall cedar under whose shade we reposed in safety, was broken down, and laid in the dust. We did well to mourn.   VICTORY.         279 We shall not see again the like of our dead chief. He was calm,' strong,- steady, a rounded character, self-poised, and yet not self-reliant, --he leaned upon God. When we went into the church on Sunday and sat down under the shadow of its mourning emblems, and listened to the bugle call of our pastor, we said "God has done it, that we may be strong for the battle of ideas which must be bravely fought if we would con- quer there." Maybe we should have rested too securely in the strong arms of our President, and failed to do our individual work. He has been taken away, that we might be warned of danger, and equipped to meet it. The spirit which slew him must itself be slain, and every man and every woman is called to be a soldier in this war. Come, buckle on the armor,'O my people, and let us to the contest. "What armor?"The Christian armor, you do not need sabres or cannon. But you need a sword. It is the sword of the Spirit. God's word. It is written all over with testimonies of human brotherhood. Take it, and fight the mean prejudices and wicked self-conceit of the times. You can strike sturdy blows for the slave with that sword. "Do you say the slave is free?" I tell you he is not free until he stands on the same level with yfa. I know he can no more be bought and sold; so much is gained. We rung the bells and fired guns, when that Amendment passed our Congress. - We had reason to be glad. It was a great step. We musft take another before our land is safe from peril. We must give the negro the ballot. Then he will indeed be free. He   280        VICTORY. can help make the laws under which he lives, and vote money for a school fund if he wants to. Very likely lie will waut to. If you don't believe it, ask any teacher of contrabands in the early war, or of Freed- men in our latter progressive days. Ask Bell Winton. Then again we shall thus have in the South some balance power for that defiant spirit which killed the noblest representative of freedom in our times. Loyal men will hold the destinies of that land, redeemed through such vast cost of treasure and precious life. Give the negro the ballot, as our only means of safety to the land, but I pray you give it to him on nobler grounds than self-preservation. Give it to him as his just right, under a Republican Government. lie is no longer a slave. The ballot belongs to freemen. It is his, as really as it is yours. You cannot urge a single ground of precedence of right. If you talk of superior intelligence, your logic limps. White men at the North who know infinitely less of the genius of- our institutions than the native black man, carry the ballot at our elections. And you are willing they should. Throw aside forever that prejudice of race, it is nothing else, which would make you withhold from the negro rights which are granted to all classes of men, who seek refuge under our flag, from the old world' tyrannies. Throw away that prejudice, as unworthy the life God has spared from this great sacrifice. He demands of you something nobler than partisan hates, and old-rut ways of thinking. Rise to the level of the hour, and help to do God's work. Don't hesitate. Take the shield of faith, if any arrows of ignorant prejudice are hurled at you, faith   VICTORY.         281 in humanity, which holds a common good, whereof all must be partakers, or all must suffer. And if you have faith in man, and faith in the Father of all, you will fight heroically, shoulder to shoulder with all the good and true, and soon victory, in this battle of ideas, will come to bless the land, and then our mourning will be ended. For the work accomplished by his death, will be greater than the great deeds his laborious life brought to pass, if we are roused by the assassin's bullet to fight for equality which alone can be liberty to the negro.           a Pity our poor humanity that it needs any such battle of ideas. The furnace heat of the past four years, should have developed right thoughts on this momentous question.  We ought to stand to-day on the rock of truth, without the use of any more levers. Has the past taught us, nothing? Where have been our eyes, that we hav'e failed to see our weal inseparably connected with the people so long oppressed? Have we forgotten how our arms suffered defeat, how we were baffled, and scourged, and stricken, until we promised liberty to the slave, wherever our flag was borne? Have we forgotten how then, there were rifts in the clouds, and the sun peeped through a little, and success came apace, and at last Victory? Have we forgotten that the son of Ham helped us fight our battles? His blood has mingled with the sacrifice God required at our hands, for our guilty oppression. He poured it out a free- will offering, glad to die, if the future good of his race could be sealed by his death. On many a field he has fought and fallen, - fallen in the van. He had no 24*   28        VIC TO IrY. home to defend, no liberty to preserve, no country which called him son, to save from the usurper's hand, and yet he asked the privilege of bearing arms. He would assert his manhood, and the right of his race to liberty, and fight and die, in hope that the white man will at last learn to be just. You know how well he has fought, and how together we have gained the victory. You know how, heaps on heaps, his slain have been piled up in battle, how they have been massacred when the enemy caught them.   With terrible risks, and but one glimmering hope, the hope of liberty, he volunteered in this contest, and has borne his full share in its losses and perils. Will the country be just which fails to give a voice in its laws to the men who have saved it from ruin? Would you take the ballot from our noble boys who come home with victory upon their banners? If you would not take it from one soldier, do not take it from another. None of our black -allies are aliens. They are American born.  Give them a chance to become American citizens, and make the best, and the most, of the manhood God has given them. 1 hope you will not be blind. We are so linked together, that the weal of the Republic hangs upon justice to this race. But let me caution you again, be just to this race, because it is their inalienable right, - not because any other course would bring ruin to you. Then you will rise to the level of the hour, and your feet will stand upon a rock, and the new Republic will have a foundation which cannot be shaken.   j- --- CHAPTER        MM XXVI. "Take heart I The promised hour draws near, I hear the downward beat of wings, And Freedom's trumpet sounding clear." @E  ELL WINTON, in her narrow prison, became conscious that something unusual was going on outside. She heard sounds of hurrying   feet. Vehicles were rolling by in mad haste ; the city seemed alive, and yet it was not day. She had faint intima- tions of the battle afar, but knew not how it was going.  Was this the bustle of preparation to meet a coming foe? Were the lines at Petersburg broken and the Union troops about to enter the Capital? She hoped so.  O, had she not suffered long I Presently there was a terrific noise like the shock of an earth- quake.  The gun-boats were blown up, but she knew not the occasion of the terrible noise. Day -crept on apace; it came very slowly to this anxious, waiting girl, - but it came. She looked out through the blinds of her prison window. She saw no sign of hurrying feet or'moving vehicle now. The sound had (283)   284       VICTORY. died away in the distance. The city seemed deserted. She watched and listened. Presently the steady rhythm of marching multitudes greeted her ear. They came nearer, - nearer. They were not the steps of broken battle-rauks, fleeing before a foe, but the regular accordant footfalls of a victorious army. She strained her eyes to see, and her ears to listen. Her heart almost stopped beating in that supreme moment when rescue seemed so near. The head of the column came in sight. O this was a triumphant hour to this girl who had learned faith in humanity. Weitzel's sable soldiers walked proudly through the streets of that city, where many of them had stood upon the auction-block and been knocked off to the highest bidder. They came as the vanguard of Grant's victorious army. They bore the symbol of liberty, the glorious " stars and stripes." The new era had dawned now. The day, waited and watched for long, by the suffering Unionists of the city, had come at last with its inspiring hopes, and its satisfying promises. We of the North rejoiced at the tidings of this proud possession of the Capital of treason. We thought we 1knew how to be glad, and so we did. But to the loyal people of Richmond, there was a deeper joy. The Union army had come to them in the extremity of need, as well as peril, and they looked upon it as their right arm of deliverance. They had been per- secuted in every conceivable manner by imperious Rebels. Few of them but had for longer or shorter time been inmates of prison dungeons. And now the skeleton Starvation looked at them with hungry eyes.   VICTORY.         285 How should they live? had been the anxious question for weary months. They were pale and thin, and almost despairing through long waiting; when the steady tramp of marching columns greeted their longing sight, marching to the familiar music of Freedom's airs, and under the protection of her beloved ensign. There was great joy in that city among the faithful few who had known only sorrow the past four years. Before the welcome vision of Union soldiers had passed by the old Winton house, there was a sound of dismay; a cry of terror. Hurried orders were given to the men, and Bell heard the awful word which rang through the air, "fire! fire! 'Already clouds of smoke curled up in the distance, and swept down towards her retreat. The fire in lapping flames, hissing and crackling, was leaping before the wind, and soon that very street, and the dear old house, would be wrapped in seething flames.  What should she do?   Where should she go? She knew not a Unionist in the city. And besides, the streets were full of hurrying soldiers, intent on saving the city from destruction. Should she go out among them, and ask protection and safe conduct to some place of security? Each was busy with the one purpose of quelling the devouring flames; would any stop to care for a helpless girl?. And Madbury down stairs I Well, she was not afraid of him, in presence of the Union army, if her little prison did, burn to ashes. The fire came nearer. It was curling about the roof of the nearest dwelling. Bell knew that to stay was death. She would go out and trust Providence for protection. She loosed the   286       VICTORY. fastenings of her prison door. Just then a voice out- side called, -"Hurry child, dere am no time to be lost," and " mamma's " arm was thrown about the trembling girl, weak and tremblincg from long confine- ment in that narrow prison, which, thank God, had been to her a saviour from an infinitely worse fate. They descended the stairs. Madbury was opening the front door, and hobbling to a place of safety. They passed him in going out. A face shone upon them, as they touched the street. "O Dick I God bless you." Bell screamed in her sudden joyful relief. "Bell Winton! Where did you come from I " said Madbury. "This way, Bell. Take my arm. Come quick, ' mamma.' Captain Ringgold, this man is the blackest kind of a Rebel." Madbury was feeling for his pistols. "That black rascal carrying off Bell Winton I " Before he could manage to get them ready for a shot, -he was lame now, - Captain Rinoggold and his men had made sure of this Rebel, pointed out by faithful Dick. "O Dick! are we safe now?" "Safe, yes. Don't you see the " stars and stripes?" Old Madbury wont trouble you any more. He'll be shut up now, I guess. I thought we shot him last summer, but I see he lived through it." "And poor Miss Bell been a prisoner, off an' on, a whole year now." ' No matter for that now. I am free." "But, where are the rest? Where is Nance?" "I 'spect she am tore all to pieces by de houn's.   VICTORY.         287 You see she got sullen, wus an' wus. An' Massa Winton sell her to ole Madblry. Then she rave, awful, an' say I Madb'ry neber shall hab her;' an' she run off. -Miadb'ry set de houn's after her, and Pompey say a woman was tore all to pieces, and we 'spect it am poor Nance, - de berry last chile poor ole ' mam- ma ' got to set houn's on to I " The old villain! Well, he'll get his pay. And poor Bob was killed when they sprung the mine. I tho't it was too bad, and he so near home, and Nance;-but it is all right now. 'Twould have killed Bob to know this." "Bob I How did poor Bob get up here? ' "He came in the army blue, ' mamma,' - enlisted at New Orleans. He has been. a good soldier, but he didn't live to see this day. A good many of us didn't live to see it." "O  Dick, it is dreadful. So much as Bob and Nance suffered in their lives too." "They will suffer no more now." "Where are you taking us, Dick?" "To Pompey's. It's the- only Union house I know, and we had better trust what we know, than any of these shams about the city." "Has Pompey lived through all these terrible days?" "Yes, Miss Bell. I seen him in de city wid eggs, a little bit ago. "I hadn't stopped to think whether he was alive or not. I thought of his hut as a place of safety, and it is retired, out of the noise, and safe from the spreading fire."   288        V I CTORY. "There is no place where I would rather go, Dick. Pompey is a true man." "You forget, Miss Bell. Pompey is a black man." "I know no difference, Dick. Truth and honor, I think, are more lustrous when found in your race than in mine, for you have had small chance of making anything of yourselves." "Thank you, Miss Bell. And you are Westgate Winton's daughter." "But my father repented before he died, and through much agony, found peace at last. I am so glad, for he was my father, - and I loved him. There is Pompey with his venerable head uncovered at our coming." "This is a great day, 'mamma'. Dinah and I have done little but sing psalms. And who are these?" "Miss Bell Winton- "Bell, my dear child, then you have been kept safe through these bloody days, thank the Lord." "Yes Pompey. And many thanks to ybu, his servant and instrument, for my safety. I shudder when I think what my fate might have been, but for the fidelity of your people." "And what is your name, brave soldier in blue?" ' Dick Rice. Don't you remember MassaWinton's coachman?" "Never should have known you, Dick, in that glori- ous uniform, the Lord bless you I and bless the good and great President who gave you arms, that you might feel the way towards liberty. Come in, my friends."   VICTORY.         289 Dinah was vibrating between tears and smiles, so great was her joy that the Union army had entered Richmond, and so full was her heart of tender memo- ries and grateful thanksgivings. "I must leave you now, and hasten to my post of duty," said Dick, and he lifted his cap and turned away. Dinah burst into a flood of tears. " O if our dear Sam could come up de lane dere, in soldier clothes I I t'ink den I should be ready to die in peace."l "Let us be thankful, Dinah, for the great good which has come to our people; and if our only child has been taken in the sacrifice, that future children -of our race may be free, we will bow submissively, - it is the Lord." "O Pompey! But de heart can't be killed so it wont cry for de lost child. I must cry, Pompey. Seein' Dick bro't poor dear Sam right back home jes as though I'd looked on his livin' face." "We shall see him in the land of Canaan, Dinah, and we shall soon be there." The morning hours were passed in this lowly hut, in praise and thanksgivings -to God. Bell joined heartily in these grateful expressions to which Pompey gave voice, and thought, as she listened tearfully, that some old prophet bent among them with his inspira- tion. Pompey's devout bearing and his reverend 'head covered with snowy hair, were not unlike the pictures she had cherished of the prophets and patriarchs of the old covenant. And whe n he thanked God that he had spared him to see this day of deliveranceand salvation, the scene in the Temple fca-me back ,to her, 25   290       VICTORY. and she rejoiced that the child Jesus had sent his light to them that " sat in darkness." It was a happy deliverance to her own troubled soul, and she could well bend her head with this humble people, and link with theirs her prayers and praises. I think the Lord was well pleased with the incense that arose from those grateful heart-altars, for his blessings came down in showers. They were eating their simple midday meal. Each face bore traces of the heart's chastened joy, and they talked of the victory which a righteous cause had gained. There was a step on the door-stone, a hand on the latch, a tall and athletic form in their midst. They were dumb with sudden and overwhelming joy. It seemed to Bell that minutes flew by before a word broke the awful silence ; then- "My child, my lost child I " burst from the lips of the long-waiting mother, and he stooped and clasped her in his arms. Pompey rose up, put his hand upon the head of his long-absent son, and said, " O God, I thank thee for this hour." Then tears came, and the bursting hearts of the little circle found relief. When the great wave of joy had passed by a little, each told his story of long-suffering, and peril, and battle, which now, thank God, had ended in sweet reunion, - liberty, peace. '"Mother, dear, I cannot find Celia." "She went off long ago, my boy; they sold her, and she run away. I think to the Union lines." "O, if she were here I -well I should be too happy. I may never see her now." Ah, my black brave. How I wish I could have   VICTO  r. .       291 reached your ear and whispered hope in it.

All through the hot, dusty, waiting summer, she helped the matron in one of our corps hospitals in front of Petersburg. Didn't you almost feel the presence of your beloved? She was very near you, as you waited in the trenches. Why didn't you get wounded and carried to the hos- pital? you would have seen her then. But maybe it was not your corps' hospital where she cooked for the sick and hurt boys. Day after day my soldier saw her there, as he went about with relief for our suffering heroes. Many a time she gave refreshment to him, as he stopped to rest a minute under the sheltering tent. Then one day he missed her. The matron said she was tired of the dust and heat, and a little sick withal, -sick for a sight of your face I know, - and had gone to Norfolk. If you live to comeback from Texas, you will find Celia waiting and watching yet. With the greenbacks you have earned mi the army you can buy a home. The girl is free. You need no longer lay up money to purchase her. Then you shall have your span again, and drive at will through the streets of Richmond, while Madbury looks through prison grates to see you pass. Take care of yourself, my brave. You will not have to fight,--Kirby  Smith has surrendered. But take care of your health, in that pestilent climate, and remember Celia is waiting for you ; don't give up hope ; - she is true. I wish I could promise as much to all my suffering heroes. But I cannot. Jupiter will never find Eliza. As he sweeps round the city of New Orleans, he will   292       VICTORY. almost leap into the surging gulf, thinking of her who was stolen from him, and sold there upon the accursed block, but she will have no intimation of the nearness of a fleet of Union vessels, bearing one who was her husband, now a soldier, going down to Texas. The puff of the steamers, and the wash of waves against the shore, will never startle her again, with thought of him, or hope of rescue. She has found rescue from the fate which was worse than death. The spring grass grows over her,--she sleeps well. How she died, Jupiter, I hope you will never know. To Jack and Huldah, there is no earthly reunion. He fell at Wagner. She toils at Fortress Monroe. Robert and Rachel lead a life of quiet and frugal industry, near the spot where they first found liberty and the Union lines. The rich and chivalrous Madbury is a wreck, body and soul. Money was his soul, his life, and that is gone. The flames lapped the Winton house, and left nothing but ashes. Confederate scrip grew worthless as rags, and his gold, Davis ran off with that. Whether any of it hung in bags to the hoops of the skirt, in which our boys captured him, I know not. But if so, Madbury will not be likely to get it. At present he is provided for with a prison bed and rations. Should President Johnson pardon him out, he will have to work or starve,--work like the meanest slave he ever bought, or scourged, or sold. I hope the President will pardon him. "God has touched him, Why should we?"   XXVII. 'I Where'er I look, where'er I stray, Thy thought goes with me on the way, And hence the prayer I breathe to-day." FTER the evacuation of Petersburg and Rich- mond, Colonel Watts went on after Lee, with the rest of the army. When that " gentleman " con- descended to surrender his broken army to our invincible leader, who has granted us the United States again, after a four years' struggle, the Colonel thought his mission was ended, his work-as a soldier done. There was some joy in the army, when they were able to look again towards the peaceful pursuits of civilians, with the happy reflection that the work they undertook to do was done, and well done. I think they had reason to be glad. They had borne the weight of the struggle. What were our anxieties and sorrows, in comparison with theirs, who endured the privations and dangers which made us weep just to think about. They had faced death, and borne hunger and wounds. We had carried our hearts heavily these long years, thinking of what they suffered. 25*    (293)   294       VICTORlY. We were all glad together, at the welcome victory. And I believe there was joy in heaven among the martyr host, who had marched on before the fight was over. When the Ninth Corps took up its march towards Washington, and had reached the vicinity of Rich- mond, Colonel Watts had a very pardonable curiosity to see how the city looked under the protecting folds of the old flag. You " don't wonder at it?"No. ]Men have gone a great way for that sight. From "away down East," and far '" outWest," they have made this welcome pilgrimage. And though they may not have seen here the prophet's birthplace, they have seen his tomb. All those fearful things which were told us about calling slave-rolls under the shadow of Bunker Hill, and hanging the " stars and bars" on Faneuil Hall, and one Southern man whipping five Yankees, are hushed now. I do not think they will be repeated in our day. The false prophet is dead. And his grave is in Richmond. The last sod was laid upon it when President Lincoln walked through the redeemed city, followed by an uncounted throng of redeemed people. The Colonel looked about the city, saw some old friends among the soldiers, wanted to see Jupiter and Dick, but they had gone to City Point. He looked over the burnt district, and thought he would like to know the locality of the Winton House. He made inquiries, and found it had gone to ashes. Where was Bell? How should he ever know that? Could   VICTOR'Y.         295 he go back North without knowing? He meditated a few minutes, and concluded he could not. The black troops had been in the city, and Dick, if alive, would know. He would assuredly seek Bell, espe- cially as he knew she was in peril from the fire. He turned his charger's head towards City Point. He rode fast, but he was used to that about Richmond, He remembered, somewhat more vividly than usual, his fleet Arabian, and the fine ride they had together. /' He should be glad to see the splendid fellow when he got home. Too good a horse to risk in war. I hope father has taken good care of him." He found Dick's regiment without difficulty, and soon made the necessary inquiries of the living lad himself. Then he sought Jupiter. Two brothers seldom clasp hands in better faith, or firmer bonds. They talked long together, chiefly about the Texas expedition. {"Come to me in New England, Jupiter, when you return. I will give you a start in the world. I am not forgetful that I owe you my life. Remember and come to me.. "I will, Colonel, if I live to come back." There was a shadow on Jupiter's face as of disap- pointment and sorrow. - ' What is it, Jupiter? what troubles you?" "I am glad you are going home, Colonel. I was thinking of that.- ' Is that all? You too shall have a home, now the war is over." "Yes, a home in the soil of Texas, -a grave, my --dear Colonel."   296       VICTORY. "Will you go with me now, if my influence can procure your discharge?" "Never I I will do my duty even unto death. Life is nothing to me." "Cheer up my friend. I trust life has much good in store for you. We will do all we can for you, when you come to us." ' For myself, I care little. But my people I You have seen the discussions in the papers,-we shall not be made citizens." A"I am very sure you will be, Jupiter, from the very fact of these discussions. The people cannot fail to discover the only right course, if they allow them- selves to think, and talk about it." "But it seems to me now is the time, Colonel. If we do not get the ballot now, before the Rebel States come back again, we shall never get it. And then we shall be oppressed again in innumerable ways. Our old masters will no longer have a property inter- est in us, and they will grind us in our wages and keep us continually under their feet." "We had better keep our arms, Jupiter, unless you have the ballot." "Perhaps necessity may appeal to the law-makers. They may think it better to check-mate Rebel votes by Loyal votes than to maintain an army to enforce order in the South. I shall be too thankful if, in any way, this blessing comes to us. But O, after we have fought side by side with you, and conquered, I wish the Government would call us men, and give us the ballot as our right." "Yes, it is so much nobler to stand upon a high   VICT  PY.        297 moral plane in all our acts, and not merely follow the instinct of self-preservation. But the blessing will be the same to you, though it comes as a necessity to the life of the nation." "The same, and yet not the same. In the one case we should have the right, because you were obliged to give it to us to save the country from Rebel usurp- ation. In the other, we should have it out of your sense of justice to us as a race. I think the joy I should experience in exercising this right, would be greatly modified by the terms upon which it had come to me." "All that is too true in its interior sense, Jupiter. But would all your people think so deeply?" "Some, not all. Most of us have learned to be thankful for favors, let them come as they will. But we all feel that we are a proscribed race, and have some natural yearnings to be considered men, if our faces are not white Y' "If there is any power in the voice and pen of the North, Jupiter, you shall be considered men before this discussion is ended." "Thtank you, my dear Colonel, and through you, all the people who have found out that we have hearts." "I must go. God bless you and keep you, Jupiter, noble fellow. Good-by." "Good-by, Colonel, the only friend I have, and the Lord bless you." "Remember and come to me when you get back from Texas," -- and the Colonel, rode away. It was evening when he thtew his bridle reins over a post by   298       VICTORY. the door of Pompey's hut. The old couple were amazed to see an officer of the Union army coming into their humble abode. And his greeting as he entered with lifted cap, was so different from anything they had seen about Richmond. Pompey rose up to meet him, and the officer held out his hand as though they were peers, and he had not stopped in the twilight shadows to see the color of their faces. "I seek Miss Winton," he said, " does she still stay with you?!" A glance about the room had made him tremble some, there was no Bell Winton visible, and it was their only room. "She is walking out enjoying the twilight and open air. She was near a year shut up, sir, in the house, some of the time in a narrow place just wide enough to lie down. She did it, sir, to escape marriage with the worst man,--well, maybe I ought not to say that. But Madbury is very, very wicked. She seems wild to be out doors, and stays out nearly all the time, now she is with us." "I will call her," said Dinah, rising. ' If you please, - no,-- I will find her. She has not gone far, I suppose." "Our plantation is not very large, you will easily find her."' Bell was walking, with her arms folded and her head bent in deep thought. She was trying to lay some plans for the future. She could not be a pen- sioner on Pompey's little store much longer, it was not right. She must seek some work, and what work? She would like to teach the freedmen, but   VIC TORY.         299 she must do something remunerative. She had given her services at Fort Monroe and Newherne, and did not know that the wide charity of the North was furnishing paid teachers. If she could earn money to pay her passage, she would go back to Aunt lyMary's, and find a home with her. She would be welcome there. Aunty was all alone now. - Little Charley had followed the flag into the jaws of death. But how should she go?  Maybe the Government vessels would take her. She would try. She saw no way to earn the passage money, and if there was, it would keep her too long with- these old people, who were not rich. It was a great thing that they would give "mamma " a home. The Colonel sees her stepping slowly, apparently intently thinking. He is afraid it may startle her some, but this time his soldierly discretion is over- matched by yearning desire; - the girl had been so brave and true! and, is she startled? Bell feels a protecting arm about her, and looks up to meet the blue eye she remembers so well. They did not go back -to the hut just then, but sat down together on the grass, and talked; the protect- ing arm still about her. - The war is over, my friends. The soldier has earned a right to talk of something else than means and( methods for the success of the Union cause. He has seen victory come to the wait- ing land. This maiden has earned a right to talk about something besides the elevation of the poor down-trodden people of the' South. Liberty will bring learning in her train, and the young and the old shall   300        VICTORY. know how to read. Let them sit there on the grass, and talk if they will. It is a long time since this soldier and teacher of contrabands had such an op- portunity. A great many things of vast moment to the country, and to these individual hearts, have come to pass, since they communed together over the Peninsular Campaign. They find ample and exhaust- less themes, I assure you. Each has a personal history. You know something about it. But never even a letter, with its tell-tale lines, has flitted between these two. The years, with their heaviness, their conflict and eventual triumph, must be unrolled. This maiden knows she saved a worthy life. Ah, she knew it by her woman's intuition before the soldier's fidelity shone out so brightly in the story of the past, which he rehearses. And he? sits in mute wonder, thinking even' his night-march out of prison, and across the rough face of North Carolina, nothing! absolutely nothing I com- pared with Bell Winton's heroic defence against the long siege of the chivalrous Madbury. "What else did they talk about?" I will not tell you while I am warden. And if it were my lover who sat with me, on the Virginia grass, you should not listen, nor count our kisses. When life's supreme crisis touches the heart of man and woman, the words they choose to speak, may not be rehearsed without profanation. Each living soul finds its appropriate expression, and the cant phrase of the novelist is a mockery of the deepest and intensest feelings, of human experience. Only this will I reveal. When they did walk slowly   VI CTORY.         301 back to Pompey's hut,'they hardly knew whether it was earth or heaven which bore them up so lightly. A great peace had come to both their hearts, and Bell's questions were all answered. She would start for Newherne the very next day! and the Colonel for his home in dear New England I Glad to rest without wounds to trouble him ; rest and tell the old folks the story of his life, as a soldier, in the great army of liberty. I will not try to depict the joy in -that home, when the "boy" came safe and sound. You know all about the tears and heart-throbs, when the one long absent, among scenes of peril, sits down again in your family circle. Alas, many of you know the agony too deep for tears, when in the thin ranks you look vainly for your beloved, who "marched away with the men" in the vigor of his youth, in the glory of his manhood. In almost every household, the deepest places of the heart have been stirred by the noise of the fight just ended. Each is busy with its own ex- perience. The heart's yearnings for those whom shallow war-graves, and insatiate prisons hide forever, may not be translated in words. We have touched a fathomless abyss of sorrow. We have reached ,the highest summits of joy. How the strain of blood and sinew has developed American thoughtl We need rest But we will not rest, -until the freedom we have gained  is established on immovable founda- tions. So closely did this reunited family cling together, that several days went by before Mary Watts found the Colonel alone. She could hardly wait to ask .the 26   302       VICTORY. questions which were knocking at the door of her heart, and several times had come very near speaking out before the whole family, which would have dis- concerted the soldier more than a Rebel bullet. When she did find him alone, she inquired, without circumlocution, where Bell Winton was 1 "In Newherne, sis." "Have you seen her since the war ended? I have written her at Newherne, and she did not answer." "She has just gone there, -came down from Rich- mond to Fortress Monroe with me." "I Then you have seen her. I hope, dear brother, you were not afraid to speak, now that you can stop being a soldier." "We talked all the time, Mary." "Please tell me what about? Are you going to marry her, Warran? O, I should be proud of such a sister I " "Marry her? Well, Mary, do you think I had better?" "We shall be terribly disappointed if you don't. I have told father and mother and the girls, and they like her as much as I do." "What have you told, sis?" a Why, - about her nursing you in the hospital, and running away from Madbury, and teaching the contrabands, and, --everything I I showed her letter too; and father says she is the ' true stuff.' " !"She is true. A glorious girl, Mary. It would make your heart ache to know how deeply she has suffered since then." "Why didn't you bring her home with you,   V ICTORY         303 Warran? then she would be safe from further perse- cutions." "She desired very much to see her aunt in New- berne." "I will go after her myself!" "O no, sis, don't. She has not had time for a visit yet. Mrs. Denton is almost her only relative, - the only one she knows anything about, and they both have had a world of trouble which they will want to talk over. Wait, sister. And meanwhile some ade- quate preparation should be made for such a visitor as Miss Winton." "What shall we do? I am ready to do all I can, - but you must give the orders, - lay the plans, dear brother." "I You need not do anything; unless it should be pleasant to you to listen to the sound of the saw and the hammer, or carry drink to the carpenters at work over there." "Well, I think I shall understand after awhile, if you do talk in riddles, my brave soldier brother. So, those are your carpenters are they? You were very shy about it. I did not know you even owned the land on that side of the road." "Haven't owned it long, sis. Don't you think real estate a good investment?" "For common earthly interest, greenbacks, Warran! But in this heavenly case, real estate, certainly!" ' And so, in a quiet New England town, on the banks of a river which I may not name, the sweet dream of long ago is taking on real form, under the guardian   304        V I CTORY. eye o0 tne proprietor, under the serene benediction of this great peace, and larger liberty which have come to our dear land. And when this beautiful house is ready, Warran Watts, the soldier, a civilian now, will go down to Newherne, and Bell Winton will come back with him. And then these two who remembered first the call of duty, will listen to the voice of love, as they sit down together, Priest and Priestess, by the Altar of Home.
