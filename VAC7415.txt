IN the following story, which the author has not pre- sumed to entitle a romance, he has attempted to narrate events that might naturally occur in the history of a family; and if, in the perusal of this simple effort, his readers shall find any scenes or incidents that may serve to render the ties of home stronger, and deqrer to their hearts than before, the highest hope of the writer is fully realized. *     THE LAST OF HS NAME. CHAPTER     I. BLOMMAHOLME. UPON the eastern coast of Sweden, a few leagues north of Stockholm, a bold promontory juts forth into the Baltic, inclosing, with a smaller southern point of land, a bay, known  by the inhabitants of the vicinity as Skurkvik. About a mile from the. mainland is located a small island. It is composed of one immense rock, lofty and steep, the summit crowned with verdure and the base skirted by a wide sandy 2   10    THE LAST OF HS NAME. beach. From  an old tradition in relation to this island the bay derived its name.; Many years ago, says the legend, a famous sea-rover infested the Baltic; for years he avoided all pursuit, and perpetrated his atrocities with un- paralleled success. At length he was driven into this bay, and after a desperate resistance was captured. So infuriated were the victors at his resistance, that they immediately conveyed the freebooter and his surviving companions to the island, and there summarily executed them, leaving their bodies exposed upon the sand. From this circumstance the bay was called Skurkvik (Rascal-bay), and  the island was named Beloning-holme (Retribution-Isle). For many years the island had been the property of a noble family, who, deterred by the many leged co ing it had never occpied i legends concerning itf had never occupied it; J   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     " but at the date of our narrative, Rodolph de Garcia, the sole survivor of his family, had removed thither, with his young wife and beautiful daughter, after having erected a costly mansion upon it. Disliking the name, which constantly reminded him of the events that had formerly happened upon the island, he changed it to Blommaholme the Isle of Flowers. And well did it answer its name. The garden at Blommaholme was literally bursting with flow- ers. The mansion had been erected upon the highest point of the island, and afforded a view of the entire bay and surrounding country. A fruitful orchard extended from the rear of the house to the edge of the precipice, at the south- ern extremity of the island; and a garden, filled with the choicest flowers and plants, stretched forth from the latticed porch in front of the   12    THE LAST OF HS NAME. house. A walk bordered with small evergreen trees conducted through the centre of the garden to the high gate of a hedge, which skirted the verge of the rock O and a long flight of stairs led from the gate to a small boat-house, which was placed near a wharf upon the beach below. Around the mansion and its orchard and gar- den, extended cultivated fields and meadows; and at the eastern side of the island was placed a large barn with its attendant sheds and yards. In short, the whole island was arranged as a farming estate of a wealthy man should be. Mr. de: Garcia, the proprietor of this beautiful island, was an only son, and had been allowed every indulgence in his youth; and although the death of his parents did not cause him to become a dissolute and extravagant man, as is generally the case with children whose passions   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     13 have never been controlled, he was, neverthe- less, selfish and vain to the highest degree. A few years before the death of his parents he had wedded a beautiful girl, and knowing that he was beloved, and imagining that he returned her love, he felt that he had every reason to be happy. After the death of his father he found himself the last of his name, and anxiously longed for a son that his family might not become extinct for ever. At length a child was born to him;  but it was a daughter. Although he loved his little Blanche with all the love -of which his heart was capable, still he -was grievously disappoint- ed. Without a son his name would die with him; and yet his most ardent wish was doomed never to be realized. At the age of seventeen Blanche was a beau-   "    THE LAST OF HS'NAME. tiful girl. Her hair was light, her cheeks were glowing with health, and her blue eyes sparkled. with animation. Graceful in her every move- ment, and amiable to a fault, she was beloved by all. Mr. de Garcia spared neither expense nor pains in her education. At an early age she received instruction in the French, Russianf, and Italian languages, and also in music, in all of which branches of education she soon' excelled. Aside from these accomplishments, she had acquired the less fashionable but more useful art of cookery. Her preceptor in this branch was Mistress Lisbeth, a privileged domestic of the family, whose greatest boast was that she had been born, christened, and married under the roof of the de Garcias. Although Mrs. Lis- beth was still on the sunny side of forty, yet she had arrived at that age when caps with long   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     15 xrills and high backs become necessary. Her, countenance was broad and blooming, her grey eyes small and twinkling, and her nose de- cidedly aristocratic, for it was turned contempt- uously upwards, having been thus formed, proba- bly, by a habit which the -good lady possessed of forcibly cramming 'her wide nostrils with snuffi Lisbeth was good-natured, in fact; but to all outward appearance, she was crabbed'and cross. From early morning until bed-time, her shrill voice resounded in the attic, in the parlors, and in the kitchen, commanding and scolding. At her approach the under servants bustled about with renewed activity, and the old family watch-dog retreated to his kennel. She was the apparent mainspring of the establishment. One of her mosti ardent admirers and disciples' was Greta, an orphan girl whom Mr. de Garcia 'i,    16    THE LAST OF HS NAME. had adopted, and who assisted Blanche at her toilet and Lisbeth in the kitchen. Mrs. de Garcia had long been an invalid. s Shortly after the birth of Blanche her lungs had become affected; and 'grieved at the disappoint- ment of her husband, which he did not care to conceal from her, that he had not been pre- sented with a son, to continue the name of his family, she sank ilto a state of despondency, which increased her malady.  De Garcia's selfishness did not permit him to refrain from constantly reproaching his wife. He cursed the hour that he had wedded her; -and happiness, which at one time, seemed to have taken its resting-place within his house, now deserted it. His wife, mourning incessantly, became so much reduced that her li-fe seemed to hang upon a thread. Her physician recommended sea-air,   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     17 and, hinted to her husband that if he should convey her to the coast she might recover, and that perhaps his fondest hopes might be realized. It was this that first induced him to' remove to Blommaholme. 2*   CHAPTER II. THE RECONCTTTA TION. IN a small but elegantly furnished apartment of the mansion at Blommaholme, Mrs. de Garcia was reclining upon a sofa. At her side stood a table, upon which were arranged vials, tumblers, and medicines. In her hand she held a book which she was perusing. The light streamed through an open window upon the dark locks of the invalid, and illumined her pale features from which beauty had not yet departed; but the traces of sorrow and suffering were plainly visible upon them. As her eyes glanced down the pages of the book, a sigh would occasionally   THE LAST OF HS NAME;     19 escape fronm iher lips, and a tear would glitter for a moment upon her cheek. The only link which now bound her to earth was her child. To her mother Blanche was al- ways dutiful and affectionate. She saw, with the deepest affliction, that an inward sorrow was gnawing at her mother's heart-strings, and with the utmost tenderness she strove to assuage her pain. Mrs. de Garcia hastily closed her book. The latch of the door was lifted, the door opened, and Blanche, closely followed by Mistress Lis- beth, entered the room.   The latter was evi- dently much excited, and vigorously pushed herself forward towards the sofa, while Blanche, with a half-concealed smile and a roguish look, restrained her by pulling at her apron string. In one hand the old lady held a large ball of   20    THE LAST OF HS NAME. dough, and in the other she elevated a large apple. , "I was born, baptized, married, and made a widow under the roof of the de Garcias," com- menced Mistress Lisbeth, ('and never did I see such things. Now listen, Mrs. de Garcia, and I will tell you all about it. Miss Blanche, here, your daughter, ma'am, sets herself up; to dictate to me, to inform me; It who have taught her to cook everything, from a herring to a goose. She wishes- to teach me how to make an apple dumpling. Now, Mrs. de Garcia--" "I will tell' you, mamma,"- interrupted Blanche. "It is simply this, -we were preparing dinner, and I was making the dumplings myself. The origin of the dispute lies in the method of cutting the apples. I suggested quartering them, ancd Mistress Lisbeth is determined that t    I     THE LAST OF HS NAME.    21 they shall be sliced. So we have brought our dispute to you, and ask you to be our umpire." "IThat's it," said Lisbeth; " now, Miss' Blanche, we shall see which was right. Now for my part I have always sliced the apples, and I was born  " "That is not in dispute," interrupted Mrs. de Garcia, with a smile. She entered into the spirit of Blanche's little plot to puzzle the good lady. "It is in relation to the slicing or quar- tering of apples. That being the question I shall speak only upon it. Even at the time of Eve, the apple was a cause of dispute; but then it brought forth knowledge. Now, as;the apple is the fruit of the tree of knowledge, should we ask it which way it should be cut for a dum- pling, it would answer: 'If I should happen to be an apple, coarse and awry, and covered with i          ,.     .   22    THE LAST OF HS NAME. warts and moles, then I should be sliced, for in that case I could not be quartered handsomely; but should I be an exceedingly beautiful apple, fair and round, then by all means quarter me, for I could fill the dumpling evenly and plumply!' What think you, Mistress Lisbeth, of the apple's argument?" "Good, quite good," replied Lisbeth, her eyes widening with astonishment at her mis. tress's erudition; "but," she continued to Blanche, who, with an air of triumph, was point- ing towards the excellent apple which Lisbeth still held in her hand, "no matter what ,the apple would say this one shall be sliced, if I can find a knife in the kitchen;" and with these words she stalked majestically out of the room. Both mother and daughter indulged in a hearty laugh at the dignified anger of the   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     23 licensed servant. The blood again commenced flowing to Mrs. de Garcia's face; her eye again sparkled as of old; but suddenly her counte- -nance changed, her features became deathly pale, as with an expression of uneasiness and pain she glanced towards the door. Her hus. band, from the hall, had been an unobserved witness of her jest with her servant. Mr. de Garcia's countenance evinced anger and vex- ation. "How often I have told you," said he, enter- ing the room, "to do away with all this frivolity. You, an invalid, should at least feel for your husband and your friends, even if you do not care for yourself. The physician gave particu- lar direction that you should indulge in no excitement, and now I  find you laughing. It will renew the bleeding at the lungs, and undo   24     THE LAST OF HS NAME. all that the medicine has already  effected. 'but when will a woman listen to reason?' "Oh, Rodolph, why do you always com- plain?" replied his wife, the tears starting to her eyes; but instantly composing herself, she forced them back. "You are right," said she coldly, "I shall laugh no more." She turned her face towards the back of the sofa, and closed her eyes as if to shut out a detested form. Her lips quivered, and she breathed short and hurried. Alarmed, Blanche sank upon her knees before the sofa, and clasped -her mother's hand. "Mother, mother," cried cshe, " are you ill?" A slight pressure of the hand reassured her. "Father, you do wrong, very wrong," sobbed she, and hastily left the room. With' knitted brows and folded arms, Mr. de   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    25 Garcia stood gazing upon his wife. As -soon as the door closed upon Blanche's retreating form, her mother arose. r "Rodolph de Garcia," said she,."when we were betrothed you said you loved me, and. I believed you, and loved you in return. We were married, and I, at least, was happy l Blanche, our daughter,- was born. Oh, ....how much I loved that child, and how my heart now clings to her--she is my only joy now." She paused, and tears slowly trickled down. her cheeks. "#ut why should I weep before you? Selfish, unjust, aye, cruel man! you have cursed me for that which I could- not control. And Jow, de Garcia, no longer my husband, I curse you, for having not only hastened my death,'but embittered my life. I have not known one moment of peace since the birth of   26    THE LAST OF HS NAME. our child: your unceasing reproaches and com- plaints have rendered me miserable, and will at length bring me to that couch, for which I have so often prayed, the bed of death. You are right, I shall smile no more." She again seated herself upon the sofa, and resting her head upon her hand gazed stead- fastly upon the floor. Never before had she spoken so firmly to her husband. He had ever considered her as a child, and had long con- ducted himself towards her as an  offended parent. For the first time since the birth of his daughter, were his eyes opened to the true position he occupied. He gazed upon the pain- convulsed features of his wife; his heart smote within him, and his eyes were moistened with repentant tears. "Blanche, my wife," he exclaimed, " pardon I .  ;1   xTHE LAST OF HS NAME.     27 me." He sank upon his knees before her, and clasped her hand. It was cold and relaxed. She returned no answer to his repeated en- treaties; but remained with her eyes fixed vacantly upon the floor. He approached his face towards her, and imprinted a quivering kiss upon her lips. "4My wife," he muttered, "forgive me, I pray you." I She lifted her eyes; they lighted with re- newed hope and love. "My husband," she said, and bursting into a flood of tears, she cast her- self into his extended arms. Overpowered by her emotion, she had fainted. With tender care the sorrow-stricken husband bore her to \ ;  her apartment, and placed her upon the bed. He hastily rang the bell, and Blanche, fol- lowed by Mistress Lisbeth, entered the room. Proper restoratives were promptly administered, *     E i   28    THE LAST OF HS NAME. and in a few moments, Mrs.'de Garcia revived. Casting a look of unutterable gratitude and love upon her husband, she placed her hand in his, and softly retaining it, she sank into a calm slumber. o   CHAPTER III. THE MESSENGER OF LOVE. ' WELL, things8 have come to a pretty pass I Ever since I have lived with the family de Garcia, I have never beheld such a sight. Klas Hans, you lout I get up. What are you doing? And in the broad daylight too I Have you no modesty? Have you no respect for the house you are in? Get up I I say, get up!" ' 'These words were loudly uttered by Mistress Lisbeth, who, standing on the threshold of the kitchen door, was the unexpected and unwel- come beholder of a scene, which the performers would have gladly concealed. Upon the floor,   8300   ETHE LAST OF HS NAME, at the feet of Greta, knelt Klas Tans Kuller, an honest fisherman, who supplied the house with fish, and who was the especial contempt of Mrs. Lisbeth, on account of his .trade, as well as of his awkwardness, for whenever he entered the kitchen, he would invariably soil it either with hirdirty boots, or by clumsily overturning his basket of fish upon the floor. Upon the present occasion he not only committed the first offence, but at the sound of the well known and much feared voice, he regained his feet so hastily that he upset his basket and scattered the fish in every direction upon the floor which Greta had, by Mrs.- Lisbeth's directions, just scrubbed to whiteness. With rueful glances first to the floor, and then to Greta, Klas Hans stood trembling with- confusion and shame. Greta, poor girl, colored to her temples, and putting   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     81 the corner of her apron to her eyes, commenced whimpering an excuse. "Don't speak to me, girl," exclaimed Lis- beth, her countenance glowing with virtuous in- dignation. "As for you, fisherman, go, leave the house. Never place foot within it again- Go!" "Do not go, Klas," exclaimed Greta wrath. fully, aroused that her lover should receive such abuse. "Stay, I will call Master de Garcia, and we shall see whether Mrs. Lisbeth can insult us. Yes, we shall see." "WhatL" screamed   the old lady, -almost choking with rage that her authority should be set at naught.  I (all Mr. de Garcia I Call him if you dare, vixen. Do you think he will allow such things to be done in his house openly?" "But, Mrs, Lisbeth," said las Hans, reco.   32    THE LAST OF HS NAME. vering his valor, by the worthy example set by Greta, " you will not be offended when I tell you, that I come here to-day expressly to ask Mr. de Garcia's permission to marry Greta, here, and," he added with persuasive smile, "also to consult you concerning the wedding. Your skill and judgment in such matters are so wide-spread, that I thought I could speak to no better person." "Oh," said Lisbeth, with an air of supreme complacency, "Mr. Kuller, that alters the case entirely. I thought that you were merely wan- toning, and of all things in the world I do abhor that; but if you are really in earnest, I will not only give my advice-which as an experienced person in such affairs, I think will be of service to you-but I will also use my influence-- which I tell you in advance is not small-with ,              .        4   THE LAST OF HS NAME.   83 our master and mistress, and I have no doubt but that with my assistance everything will turn out prosperously for you."- "How can we thank you enough?"   ex. claimed Klas Hans, executing a caper, which he concluded by bringing his foot down to the floor so violently that the mud flew from his dirt- begrimed boots in every direction, even spot- ting Mrs. Lisbeth's snow-white apron. "You varlet!" cried the old lady, reddening with anger; but by thrusting a large pinch of snuff up her nostrils, she regained her good- nature, and advancing with the utmost dignity to the couple, she united their hands. "There,' said she, "be satisfied; I will go to Mr. de Garcia's room and announce your intention." In a small apartment which was used by Mr. de Garcia as a library, that gentleman   34    THE LAST OF HS NAME. was seated, with a number of newspapers spread upon his lap. Among them were several Eng- lish papers, one of which he was examining with a curious eye. The English newspapers had been forwarded to him by a friend from the city, his former residence, and several articles were marked with a pen. He scanned them earnestly, endeavoring to comprehend, their meaning; but unfortunately he was acquainted only with the most familiar phrases and words of the language, and consequently was unable to read the designated articles. Yet he continued to puzzle his brain over them, regretting deeply that he had not acquired- the language. While he was thus engaged, he heard a slight tap on the door, which slowly  ened, a  Bland Blanche thrust her head, through the aperture. ". Good morning, papa, may I come in?"   THE LAST OF HS NAME,     85 "Certainly, my child," replied her father, looking up from his paper, " you are the very person I stand most in need of. Do come and  help me with this paper; with your knowledge of languages you can certainly assist, me in  translating from this abominable English news. paper." "Eaglish, papa I I know nothing of English, although when I have read translations from those dehghtful English auhors I have often longed to learn it that I might read them in the original." "And do yo. still desir to learn the lan- guage?" inquired her fatew. "Yes, yes, above all things," repled Blawohe, clapping her hands joyfully. "Then you shall havoe an opportunity, my child," said her father; "this very day I will   36    THE LAST OF HS NAME. visit the city, and if I can find a person compe- tent to teach the language, I shall bring him to you at any cost." " Oh, thanks, many thanks!:' exclaimed Blanche; "I will at once return to mamma's room and tell her of the project." Blanche hastened towards the door; but the moment she opened it she was confronted by Mistress Lisbeth, who, that she might smoothe down her cap, and brush the mud-stains from her apron, had remained .moment upon the thresh- old before entering. Her hand was raised to give a slight knock at the door, when it was, suddenly opened, and to the dismay of the worthy lady, she found herself in the awkward position of'actually shaking her fist in the face of her young mistress. Blushing deeply Mistress Lisbeth sank in a humble courtesey. 1.   THE LAST OF HS NAME.       87 "Pardon  my intrusion," said she, slowly re- gaining her presence of mind; "  but I am a messenger of love, I have come to intercede for two anxious lovers." "What!" exclaimed de Garcia, "you do not think of committing matrimony a second time, do you, Mistress Lisbeth?  Pray, who is. the fortunate man?'" "It is not for myself I wish to speak," re- plied Mrs. Lisbeth, her face mantling with con- fusion at her master's words, 'for the honest dame really hoped that she might have a second opportunity to tread the thorny path of wedlock, "but I have come to speak in behalf of Greta, who wishes your consent to her betrothal with Klas Hans, the fisherman." "Klas Hans, did you say?  He is a worthy man, and will make an     excellent husband, * ,                 (i   38    THE LAST OF HS NAME. Send him to my room at once, I should like to converse with him." Lisbeth was aboiut hastening to comply with her master's request, when a shrill cry-was heard proceeding from Mrs. de Garcia's .apartment. As with one impulse, 'de Garcia, Blanche, and Lisbeth, hastened to the room of the sick lady. I I   CHAPTE    R IV. TEARS. SINCE the reconciliation between herself and husband, Mrs. de Garcia had not left her bed. She, experienced no pain; but was feeble, so feeble that it was with difficulty that she could move. Yet she was happy; her husband spent hour after hour at her bedside, conversing plea. santly, and forming many little plans for future joys when she should be fully restored to health. The physicians considered her case by no means dangerous; on the contrary, they supposed that it promised a most favorable change. When she should arise, they said, she would be.   40 "    THE LAST OF HS NAME. entirely free from disease. Patiently and hope- fully she awaited the result. Lulled by the consoling words of the physicians, and the calm happiness of the invalid, both de Garcia and his daughter feared nothing for the future, The morning that her father had received his weekly supply of newspapers from his friend in the city, Blanche remained with her mother while he went to his office, to peruse them. Mrs. de Garcia appeared unusually well; she, conversed much with her daughter, and fondly indulged in bright anticipations of the happi- ness which was yet in store. At length she slept, and Blanche, oppressed with a feeling' of loneliness determined to go to her father's room, and ask him to return with her. Leaving the door of her mother's apartment ajar, that she might hear the slightest noise, she softly pro-   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     41 ceeded to her father's room. A few moments after she had left the room, her mother awoke, and perceiving that she was alone, and feeling uncommonly strong, she concluded to arise, and sit by the window, that she might afford a pleasurable  surprise to her husband  and daughter, when they should return. She softly arose from the bed, and succeeded in gaining her feet, when a sudden dizziness attacked her, and with a sharp cry of terror, she sank sense- less on the floor. De Garcia was the first that entered the room. With a cry of horror he started back at the terrible vision that met his gaze. Extended upon the floor, apparently a corpse, he beheld his wife, the blood issuing from her mouth in a copious stream. Blanche, through terror unable to move, gazed wildly upon the senseless form , i  , v, .     ,         .   42    THE LAST OF HS NAME. of her mother. Lisbeth, however, did not lose her presence of mind; she quickly lifted the inanimate form of her mistress from the floor and placed it upon the bed, Then speeding to the kitchen, she bade Klas ]ans to hasten for a physician, after which she returned to the sick room. Mr. de Garcia had seated himself at the head of the bed; with one hand he wiped the cold perspiration from the brow of his wife, and with the other he clasped her flaccid hand. Blanche was kneeling at the side of the bed, gazing with, an expression of the deepest anxiety upon the changing features of her t mother. A deep sigh broke over the lips of the suf- fering woman.- She opened her eyes and- glanced wildly round the room. Her gaze fell upon her husband's anxious faoe.  A smile   TEE LAST OF HS NAME. i   48 illumed her countenance. "All is over, dear Rodolph," she whispered. "God bless you-- Love ,our daughter."  She ceased, her strength failed her.  "Dear Blanche, speak not so," entreated the grief-stricken husband. "We are yet to be happy; look upon me, oh, look upon me, my wife, my guardian angel." The tears blinded his eyes, and fell thick and fast upon the pillow. "Blanche, my child," murmured the dying mother, 'love your father- obey him-console him-be always gentle with him." "Oh, mother," sobbed the afflicted Blanche, "you must not, cannot leave us." "Dear child," said her mother firmly, ap- parently regaining strength, "add not to the pangs of our parting by this useless repining. I am prepared to go, for Wveeks I have prayed            * .   "    THE LAST OF HS NAME. that GP  night preserve me for those I'love; but he has thought fit to call me to him, and he wills all things for the best.--We shall meet, my daughter, we shall meet in heaven." She ceased, her breath was short and hurried. Her eyes were turned towards her husband. She placed her arm around his neck and drew his face towards her cheek. "lanche--my daughter," she gasped, " your hand-come to me-Farewell." With a deep sigh the -spirit of the gentle being took its flight. Lisbeth kneeling at the foot of the bed, with upturned face, wept and sobbed piteously. Blanche, unable to weep, wrung her hands in silent agony. Her father, with a deep groan, rose from his seat and has- tened from the room. The physician suddenly entered the room. With one glance he comrn   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     45 prehended all. Tenderly he conducted the suf- fering Blanche from the apartment. With one long look upon the calm features of her de- parted mistress, Lisbeth, with streaming eyes and aching heart, left the room. And alone in that quiet chamber reposed the dead.            ,    CHAPTER V. THE TWO SURPRISES. FOUR months elapsed after the death of Mrs. de Garcia. It was autumn, .and the estate of Blommaholme presented a scene of animation. Each day were its fields enlivened by groups of busy harvesters, as they gathered the abundant crops; and the lowing of oxen and the creaking of cartwheels, together with the shouts of men and boys, increased the effect of the bustle and activity. To drown his sorrows, de Garcia mingled with the laborers; buit vain were his efforts to assuage his grief, the remembrance of his wifeawas ever in his mind.   THE LAST OF HSNXAME.     47 Blanche mourned -sincerely for the death of her mother; but the remembrance of the dying words of her beloved parent contributed much to alleviate her sorrow. She assisted Mrs. Lis.- beth in the household duties, and every evening after her father had returned from the fields, she would read to him from his favorite volumes, or sing the songs he loved. To de Garcia she was an angel of consolation. For hours would he sit, and gaze into her face, tracing the like- ness of her mother in her features, and listen to her soft voice as she sang the ancient plaintive melodies that bore him back to youth again. One beautiful morning, after her father had gone to the field, Blanche was aroused from her book by a knock at the door. "Good morning, Miss Blanche," said :Lis- beth, entering the room. "I have come on an   48    THE LAST OF HS NAME.  errand. You cannot have forgotten Klas Hans and Greta?"  "I remember them well," replied Blanche sadly.  "Yes, my dear lady, we all remember with sorrow the day they were betrothed; but, never- theless, we must not allow  them to suffer because we are in grief. The day appointed for their marriage is near at hand. I have come to consult you concerning it. Will you permit me?,"  "Certainly, Lisbeth." "Well then," said Lisbeth, who, now that she- had received permission, felt' per- fectly at liberty to expatiate upon a subject which was ever dear to her. "Klas Hans came to my room last night, and knocked at the door. It was quite late, and I was just   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    49 about putting on my nightcap, for I was very sleepy; but when I heard him say, ' Dear Mrs. Lisbeth, please let me speak to you' on a very important subject,' I knew something was to take place, so I wrapped my large shawl around me, and opened the door. 'Now, Klas,' said I, 'what is it that brings you to my room at this time of night? ' Well, you must know,: said he, 'that I and- Greta have been talking o ver our affairs together, and she, remembering that it was through your influence that Mr. de Garcia allowed us to be betrothed, advised me to go to you and request you to ask his consent to our wedding.' ' What! ' said I, ' do you intend to marry so soon?"  ' Why,' he resumed, 'when we were betrothed, we agreed that our wedding day should take place before the harvest was gathered, -so that we might have   50    THE LAST OF HS NAME. a little merry-making.' Now, Miss Blanche, this I thought was an excellent idea, for it would be very sad, indeed, if the poor couple did not have music andi dancing at their whdding; for when I was married, although you do not remember it, for you were but a baby at that time, we had the most magnificent ball that ever took place on the estate, before or after, and I was born-well, as I was saying, I thought Klas Hans had hit on an excellent plan, for when the harvesters are all here, there will be plenty of dancers, and for a fiddler, Klas said, that as he could not dance himself-he is a little stiff, you remember, in his rheumatic leg--he would play himself, immediately after the cere- mony. But still I thought I would make some objection, so I asked him if there would be time to have the banns regularly published. 'Oh,' ,.    THE LAST OF HS NAME.     61 said he slyly, ' I took care of that, for the very next Sunday after we were betrothed the banns were published in the village, church, you know I have a boat and a pair of oarsl' So when I found that I eould make no further ob- jection, I told him I would speak to Mr. de Garcia about it, and now I have come to ask your advice." "I do not understand," said Blanche, much amused at Lisbeth's earnestness, "why it is necessary to ask for papa's consent at all. Greta might marry Klas whenever she chose." "Ah, but Greta, poor child, dares not take such a step without the .consent of her kind pro- tector; besides, Klas wishes, as Gretai told me, to ask another boon of your father, which would be denied, he thinks, if he should marry her without consulting him."   52    THE LAST OF HS NAME. ".That alters the case," said Blanche, with a smile; " tell Klas, and Greta also, that they may rest satisfied, I will speak to papa myself this evening, and he will deny me nothing." Mistress Lisbeth descended to, the kitchen and told Greta the successful issue of her expe- dition. That evening Blanche and her father, as usual, met in the parlor. "Take your harp, my child," said he, " sing something lively, for my heart feels lighter this evening than it has for many weeks." "I am rejoiced at that, papa," replied Blanche, "for now you can listen more favor- ably to a little plot of mine. Klas Hans and Greta are anxious that their wedding should take place before the close of the harvest, that they may have a ball. Now, papa, do you not   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     53 think it would be an excellent plan to appoint next Tuesday for ,;their marriage day?" "You have advanced the subject so sud- denly, my child," replied her father, " that I scarce know how to answer." "But, papa, you must make no objections, for both Greta and Tl]as are impatient, and it would be a great disappointment to them if they should not have a merry-making at their wed- ding. Please, papa, say yes." "If you are really so desirous that their wed- ding should take place next Tuesday, Blanche, why, I must consent at once; but now to repay you for the surprise you have made me, read that." He extended an open letter to her. She read as follows: MR DE GARCIA: "Your letter I received a few days since   A54:   TITHE LAST OF HS NAME. from your friend, the Baron de Reinhold. I am at present unoccupied, and shall be much pleased at an opportunity of seeing you personally, when, perhapsi a favorable arrangement may be effected., "Yours respectfully, - "EDMUND DENYS." "What does it mean, father?" exclaimed' Blanche, eagerly. "Do you wish to know very much, my child?" replied her fother with a smile: -"now, if I was a hard-hearted father I 'should tantalize you by withholding the news I have for you; but being, as you know -'^ "Oh, papa, do tell me," interrupted Blanche. "Then to cut the matter short, you must know that-Edmund Denys is an Englishman, rather an, American, whom I instructed the   ,THE LAST OF HS NAME.    55 Baron to engage as your tutor in the English language. Are you satisfied with- that arrange- ment?" Blanche was satisfied, for long had she de- sired to acquire the English language, and aside from that her present life was so monotonous, that any change would be agreeable. But, above all, she longed to behold a native of that distant country of which she had so often heard and read. In her fancy it was peopled with copper-colored savages, who, clothed in fan- tastic guise, occupied their time- in chasing the wild beasts of the forest, or in cruelly toma- hawking and scalping each other. She sincerely hoped that this savage was a tame one, for she had frequently read that they, when enraged, spared neither woman nor child. She indeed knew that America was peopled by the whites;   56    THE LAST OF HS NAME. but yet so strongly was her imagination embued with romantic fancies gained from the perusal of highly wrought tales, that she disliked to relin- quish the idea that America was a barbarous and savage land. "What are you thinking about, Blanche?" questioned her father, much surprised at her prolonged silence., "Is he an Indian, papa?" inquired Blanche, thoughtfully. "We shall see when he arrives. I have sent word to tfie Baron that I shall expect to meet the young American to-morrow morning at nine o'clock, at the landing," t. o" 1t   CHAPTER      VI. THE TUTOR'S ARRIVAL. AT eight o'clock the following morning, de Garcia descended to the boat-house, and enter- ing a  boat, requested Klas tans to row him across the  bay. In a moment the fisherman deserted his net, which he was coiling away in the stern of his little fishing skiff, and sprang into the boat, which was soon dancing over the waves of the bay propelled by his stalwart arms. "So, Klas," said de Garcia, "you are desir- ous of marrying our Greta, are you?"   \ Klas was so much confused at this abrupt question that he o mrised a stroke of the oar     58    THE LAST OF Hs NAME. and fell backwards, nearly overturning the boat. "With your permission, su-' he replied, re- covering his presence of mind and his oar at the same time.         - "Next Tuesday then," said Mr. de Garcia, smiling at the catastrophe caused by his words, "if you have no objections, the wedding shall take place." glas Hans, of course, made no objections to this arrangement, and therefore the matter was settled. Upon the landing of the boat at the dock, Mr. de Garcia was met by his friend the Baron, and the young American, to whom de Garcia was immediately introduced. Edmund Denys was attall young man, of slight figure, and a countenance pale and intellectual. His hair was   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     59 black and flowing, his eyes dark, and his whole bearing evinced a degree of modesty which immediately won de Garcia's favor. He was clothed in complete blacki and his countenance wore an expression of sorrow. "We shall be friends, Mr. Denys;" said de Garcia warmly, shaking the young man's prof- fered hand. "I trust so," replied Edmund, as warmly. "Misfortune has come upon me, and I am in need of friends." " We will at once proceed to Blomma- holme," said de Garcia; " will you accompany us, Baron?" "Not to-day," replied the Baron, "my little , wife expects me home." "Then, my dear Baron, I must insist upon your returning home, but please inform your ,   60     THE LAST OF HS NAME. wife,-that her old friend de Garcia invites her- self and husband to be present at his house, next Monday, to participate in a little festival that is to come off the next day. Now, don't refuse me, my friend." "We shall be there," exclaimed the Baron gayly, and springing into his carriage, he soon disappeared. The windeow of Blanche's apartment com-- manded a view of the bay and thd main shore. As soon as her father had left the house, Blanche seated herself at the window with her lorgnette. She saw the Baron's carriage arrive at the land. ing, and observed the introduction of the stran- ger to her father. Butto her regret the lorg- nette was not sufficiently powerful to enable her to distinguish their features. In her secluded home, Blanche, had had but ,few opportunities of  O   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     61 holding intercourse with gentlemen. Her for- ) mer tutors had been females, and the only men with whom she had been at all familiar, were her father and his friend the Baron. During i almost the entire night she had remained wake- ful, musing upon the stranger who was to make his appearance the next day. Was he young or old, red or white, she knew not, but impatiently she had longed for morning, that her curiosity might be satisfied. She watched the progress of the boat as it approached the island, but at the very moment it had arrived sufficiently near for her to distinguish the occupants, it disap. peared beneath the cliff, before she could bring her glass to bear upon it. With an exclamation of disappointment, she pettishy dast the lorg- nette upon   a small table, and determined to await the arrival of the stranger patiently.   62    THE LAST OF HS - NAME. Whether she succeeded in this determination is doubtful, for although she selected a book to ;compose her mind, a close observer would have discovered that her eyes were fixed upon the door instead of the book, which perhaps was fortunate, for unluckily the volume was upside down I Upon the doorstep stood Mistress Lisbeth to receive the stranger. She had been duly in- formed of his intende& arrival, and. had, with great care, prepared an apartment for him. While she had been engaged in the occupation of dusting the room and arranging the furniture, she had held the following soliloquy: "Well, well, who knows what will come of it? I am not yet too old. Let me see, I shall be thirty- nine years old next month. I really hope the American gentleman is forty, for then, perhaps,   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     63 in a year or so we shall have another ball, and I: can have an opportunity of dancing at my second wedding." With such hopes, Mrs. Lis- beth took more pains in arranging the room, and it was not until she had- changed the cur- tairis, and altered the location of each piece of furniture at least a dozen times, that she was satisfied with her work. Mr. de Garcia and his youthful companion reached the landing at Blomnmaholme, and as- cending the steps they proceeded to the house. As soon as Lisbeth saw them approaching, she assumed one of her happiest smiles, and prepared to make her best courtesey; but upon their near approach, she observed that the stranger was a very young man, and uncommonly handsome. Overcome by her disappointment, the good lady could not wait to greet them; but hastened into t    "    THE LAST OF HS NAME. the kitchen, where she vented her vexation upon the innocent Greta, and it was not until she was summoned by her- master to conduct Mr. Denys to his apartment, that she was ena- bled to regain her usual equanimity. Thoughtfully Edmund Denys paced to and fro in his apartment. One year before he had left his home in the western world, with bright and joyous anticipations of a pleasant journey through the countries of the Old World, and for nine months his brightest hopes had been realized.  He had travelled through sunny France, and had mingled in the pleasures of the gay city of Paris; he had sojourned in Italy, and he had spent many happy days in, the quaint old cities of Germany. His father, a wealthy merchant of one of the largest commer- cial cities of the New World, had furnished him   THE LAST OF HS NAME.      65 from time to time with supplies 'of money, wherewith he might defray the expenses of his journey,  At length Edmund determined to visit the Scandinavian countries; he longed to tread upon the soil which the ancient bards of the land of his ancestors had rendered classic. He proceeded to Copenhagen, and from   thence to Stockholm.   While in this city he made a draft on  his, father's banker, for an amount of money sufficient to defray-the expenses of his homeward voyage. Six weeks, afterwards he received a letter, inclosing the draft, ,stating that his father had failed in business. Bythe same mail he also received a, letter from .his only sister. The letter bore a black seal. Broken- hearted at his misfortune, his father had died. His afflicted sister, now an orphan, for their mo- ther had died, many years before, had been Q     A4*   "    THE LAST OF HS NAME. kindly received by a relation who resided in the country. "My beloved brother," concluded the letter, "your absence, under the present circumstances, is doubly painful. I send you in this letter all the money I could collect. It may possibly be sufficient to bring you back to me; if not it will at least assist you in. procuring occupation by which you may earn enough to do so. With your accomplishments and education I should think you would have no difficulty in finding employment.  Do not be discouraged, my good brother, but leave no stone unturned. God will aid those who bravely breast the storm. "Your-sister, "MARY." In the letter was a draft on a Stockholm   THE LAST OF HS NAME. '7 ,!, banking-house for one hundred dollars., Ed- i mund determined to follow the advice of .his sister. Among the first with whom he had become acquainted was the Baron de Reinhold, who frequently visited the capital.; When Ed- mund next met the Baron he frankly told him of his misfortunes and his desires. "I am' rejoiced to hear it," said the Baron joyously; "that is," he continued, "I am glad that I can have an opportunity of serving you. How would you like to teach the English lan- guage to a young and beautiful girl, so beautiful that her smiles alone would be a sufficient re- compense?  But you Americans," he added with a laugh, "require more than the smiles of beauty as a remuneration for services, so I will further inform you, that her father will reward you handsomely."   68    THE LAST OF HS NAME. "You are indeed a good friend," replied Edmund, warmly pressing the Baron's hand. "This very morning," continued the Baron, "I received a letter from my friend de Garcia,-a wealthy nobleman, who owns a perfect paradise, which I assure you does not want its Eve, re- questing me to procure an English teacher for his daughter. I will write to him immediately." Five days after this conversation, Edmund received a letter from Mr, de Garcia, requesting his appearance at Blommaholme.   CHAPTER VII. THE INTRODUCTION. BLANCHE devoted more than usual care on her toilet, that morning, that she might appear at the dinner table to a good advantage before the stranger. Immediately after his return, her father had proceeded to the field to superintend the operations of the laborers, without informing her when she should be introduced to her new tutor. Strangely anxious and uneasy she did not leave her apartment, and when Lisbeth, as usual, went to her room to consult her con- cerning dinner, Blanche replied so sharply that the intruding domestic left the room in wonder. '   70    THE LAST OF HS NAME. Long before the dinner hour, Blanche was dressed, and as soon as she heard her father's step in the hall, coming, as was his custom, to summon her to dinner, she hastily advanced to meet him. He greeted her with a warm kiss. "So," said he, with a pleasant smile, "you are going to meet your tutor with all the honors. That is right. Come." They proceeded to the dining room; but to her dismay Blanche observed that the table was; spread only for three persons. "There is a plate wanting," said she hastily to Mrs. Lisbeth. "O, no," replied Lisbeth, with, as Blanche thought, astonishing coolness. "The young gentleman, when summoned to dinner, prayed to be excused, as he felt slightly unwell." Blanche was disappointed. Never before   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     71 had the dinner table appeared so lonely. "One more person," thought she "would make our table look much more pleasant." Immediately after dinner, de Garcia pro- ceeded to Edmund's apartment.  The young man was seated by the window, reading with tearful eyes the often perused letter of his sister. Overcome by a sense of utter loneliness, he felt that he could not present himself atd the dinner table, and therefore, under'a pretence of illness, excused himself. Upon hearing de Garcia's knock, he immediately arose and admitted him. "Pardon my intrusion," said de Garcia po- litely, " but I feared you might be seriously ill." "Frankly, sir," replied Edmund, "I am not ill in body; but mentally I suffer much. You may understand the feelings of one, who finds himself a stranger, under a strange roof. I   72    THE LAST OF HS NAME. wished, sir, to compose myself before I appeared before my future pupil." "Youhare right; but hereafter, my young friend, I wish you to consider my roof a friendly one. As its inmate, it is your home. At four o'clock this afternoon, coffee will be served in the parlor; if you feel inclined to partake with us at that hour, I will call for you."  Edmund cordially accepted the kind invita- tion, and after a few moments' conversation de Garcia left the apartment. And now Edmund's thoughts turned themselves towards his young pupil. Why was it that he felt an anxious longing for the first- interview with her, and that he experienced a feeling of uneasiness for the result?.: The words of his friend, the Baron, continually resounded within his ears, " a paradise which does not want its Eve." "Blom-   THE LAST OF. HS NAME.     73 maholme," he thought, ".certainly deserved the title, paradise, and should its mistress prove as fair as it is beautiful-and if she should, she is to be my pupil only-what can I, an humble tutor, be to her, or she to me?-simply teacher and scholar.- There let it end." He sighed deeply. "Pshaw!" he continued, "I am day-dreaming again; I could afford to build castles, when I was the son of a wealthy man; but now, as merchants say, to business." He unpacked 'his trunk, and carefully selected from his store of books such as would be useful. "There," he muttered, placing a book upon a chair, "there is Noah Webster's Elementary spelling-book. How it reminds me of home l Here," he continued, lifting another book, ", here is old Lindley Murray. He was a good man;   74    THE LAST OF HS NAME. but he has much to answer for. But I never- theless place him over Webster. Now for my dictionary, and then I have enough to begin with. No, here is a Swedish ' Larobok i Engel- ska. Spraket, med Las-och Skrif-ofn ngar for Begynnare,' a clumsy and inaccua book; but in my case indispensable. I hope my scholar will prove tractable. What, is it so late!" The last words were called forth by a rap at the door. He arose and admitted de Garcia. "I am a little early," said the latter, " but if you are ready we will at once proceed to the parlor." Edmund was about taking the books he had selected. "Oh," said de Garcia with a smile, "you need not commence operations until to- morrow, This afternoon we will have a little sociable conversation." They descended to the parlor, an elegantly   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     75 furnished apartment. With a brief excuse, Mr. de Garcia left his guest, and went to summon his daughter. Edmund glanced round the room. It was lighted at either extremity by  two lofty bay-windows, each serving in the capacity of a conservatory. Delicate plants and vines were growing in small vases arranged in the cavities of the windows, loading the at' mosphere of the apartment with fragrance. Upon each side of the room were placed richly cushioned sofas and lounges, and in the centre stood an elaborately carved table, upon which was placed a vase of freshy gathered flowers, vieing in brilliancy with the vivid colors of the soft carpet. The walls were decorated with oil-paintings, among which were portraits of de Garcia and' his wife. From the lofty ceiling was suspended a massive chandelier with glit- !   76    THE LAST OF HS NAME. tering pendants, and in a corner Edmund ob- served an elegant harp. Before he had fully completed his observations, -the door opened, and Mr. de Garcia and his daughter entered the room. Edmund was startled by her beauty. "My daughter Blanche, Mr. Denys,' said de Garcia pleasantly, "I hope you willi soon be- come well acquainted.-" With an effort, Edmund regained his pre- sence of mind, and bowed deeply to Blanche, who, blushing and confused, she knew not why, returned his salutation. An unpleasant silence ensued, which was agreeably interrupted by the entrance of Lis- beth bearing a silver salver, upon which was placed the coffee urn, and a plate of frosted cake. And now the conversation gradually as- \   THEB LAST OF HS NAME.     " sumed a cheerful and lively tone'. Edmund related-of the continually increasing prosperity of his native land, of its cities, and its govern- ment.  , "But," he continued, "a description of the forest scenery of America willprove more in- teresting to you. Away to  the westward, beyond the great lakes, there can be found true enjoyment for a gallant heart and a bold: eye. There rise forests of noble trees, yet uncontamni- nated by the axe, and through their glades roam countless creatures, and birds of every hue are chattering among their- leafy branches. In autumn comes the glorious Indian slammer; the trees deck themselves in golden garments, and the sun shines sftly upon the: earth through a dreamy vapor. Oh, how silent is the dayI Then are the forests hushed in slumber,:so styill and   78     THE LAST OF HS NAME. beautiful are they that one's thoughts are elevated above the earth. For hours could the traveller recline upon the grass, and wait the coming of the evening; then, when the sun is sinking be- hind the western hills, then come a thousand sweet-toned warblers and fill the very atmosphere with music-crickets, grasshoppers, katydids, frogs, and piping tree toads, swell their throats, bursting with music. From every bush, tree, blade of grass, pool, marsh, or fen, issues har- mony. But before darkness clothes the earth, the wanderer must leave these enchanting forests. He reache -their outskirts, and behold, a new scene is presented to his enraptured gaze. A giant river stays his progress. His eyes can scarcely discern the opposite shore of the ,wift- rushing and majestic river. A small black spot is Seen, buffeting the foaming current. Halloo I   THE LAST OF HS NAME.      79 halloo loudly shouts the traveller. It is a ferry-boat, which is- wildly dancing over the. waves of the river, gilded by the last rays of the setting sun. It reaches the shore, the tra- veller enters it, and soon he is himself'sailing upon the surface of the water. How, sublime the scenery; the forest-skirted stream, rushing silently but powerfully -in its course, the little vessel nobly battling with the element, and above' all the profound silence, contrasting so strongly with the merry noises he has left be- hind. The boat approaches the opposite shore, again comes the music of the night; again he hears the tiny warblers of nature. The keel grates upon the gravelly beach, and the traveller springs upon the shore. He marches through marsh, and over rocks, towards the forest, the bluish outlines of which he can faintly perceive   80     THE LAST OF HS NAME. through the uncertain twilight. Upon his right hand, high rocky cliffs are- towering towards the sky; and through their clefts and ravines are gushing water-falls and rushing streams. On his left extends a prairie, overgrown with high wild grass, and stretching forth for miles; a sea of verdure. Swarms of loud chattering birds fly from the plain towards the cliff, for the/ setting sun has brought forth a thunder- cloud, which is rapidly approaching. Anon the traveller perceives a strange form approaching him. A  red-faced savage, acoutred with gun and ammunition, and with a slain deer slung over his shoulders, crosses his path. with hasty strides. With the speed of a horse rushes the wild son of the wilderness through the dreary space, like a phantom, which   at night is moved  by the wind o'er swamp and moor.   THE LAST OF HS NAME.      81 He heeds no road, nor path, nor ferry;  the world is his home, the sky his roof, and his keen senses guide him safely. He moves for- ward in a straight line. He does not hasten around the base of a hill, but boldly mounts over its summit. He calls not for' the ferry: but with his burden, springs into his light bark canoe, and soon vanishes from the wanderer's sight. He laughs at the uncouth haste of the white man, who now attempts to reach the forest to obtain shelter from the rain, which is begin- ning to fall in large and heavy drops. At the first raindrop, the many-throated insects and creatures cease their' notes. For a moment the forest is silent; but then it speaks in a mil- lion tongues. The wind roars above the tall tree tops, whistling and  moaning; branches crack, and occasionally a heavy crash betokens   82    THE LAST-OF HS NAME. the fate of a noble tree. Now flashes the lurid lightning; then comes the thunder rolling over the forest, and awakening in its recesses a thou- sand ponderous, echoes. But neither the rain nor the lightning, now the traveller heeds. A friendly cabin! shelters him, and at the table of the rough; but hospitable settler, he refreshes himself, while his good hostess prepares for him a dean and comfortable bed." Edmund ceased. Blanche had eagerly drunk in his every word. With flashing eye and heaving breast she listened to the glowing description.:  "Have you beheld such scenes?" she in- quired. "Frequently," replied' Edmund; "it was ever my delight to roam through the forests. Wearied with the monotonous life of the city, I   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     83 have often made long excursions in the western portions of America." "But, sir," said de Garcia, " we: Swedes sup. pose that Sweden stands unsurpassed, for; the beauty and grandeur of its scenery"  "And so it does," repliedEdmund. "During my short stay in this country I have revelled in the beauty of your lakes and valleys, the wild- ness and grandeur of your mountaip; b;bt they have not that extent, that immensity of space, so to'speak, which characterizes the .soenery of America. -For whole weeks, a traveller might journey in one direction, .and rarely meet a human being, and not, reach the end of his roa4. This it is that lends sublimity: to American sce nery, although it does not surpass in beauty ,hat of Sweden." "I comprehend you," said ,de Garcia,; "nat   84    THE LAST OF-- HS NAME. ture in America performsg her works on an extensive scale. Your lakes, mountains, cas- cades, rivers, valleys, caverns, and plains, are all vast in bulk and imposingly magnificent." "Oh," exclaimed Blanche, warmly, "how I long to gaze upon such scenery. I could spend whole days in those sublime forests, and then at night the musical hum of the insects-how de- lightful life must be in the new worldl " "Ah, yes, Miss Blanche," said Edmund, with a smile, "but among- those insects I forgot to mention the hum of a certain one, whose notes are most musical. At the dead of night, when the weary traveller would sleep, comes a tiny creature with gossamer wings, and fairy-like music, to drive away the drowsy god. Softly he flies, hither and thither, now loudly singing, then faintly humming; now he lights upon the   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     8 pillow, anon" he touches the ceiling, and now, with a hum of satisfaction, he lights upon the nose of the would-be sleeper. A stinging pain follows; slap comes the hand, stunning the suf- ferer, and away flies our mosquito, merrily chanting his song of triumph, leaving behind him on the unfortunate nose, a slight wound, which swells and smarts beneath the continued rubbing of the now thoroughly awakened tra- veller. He again settles himself with the stern determination of sleeping, and, begins to doze, when, hum---, hum--, hum--, at least a  dozen mosquitoes are buzing around his head. Driven to desperation he arises, strikes a light, and commences a furious onslaught upon his-troublesome enemies. His eyes light upon the delicate form of one of them hanging from the ceiling by his long and slender legs. With   86     THE LAST OF HS NAME. a fierce blow:he strikes the ceiling, and a small spot of blood stains the whiteness of the wall. Thus he continues until the music ceases, and then he retires to his bed fully assured that he shall now  slumber undisturbed.  But how greatly is he mistaken; again comes the shrill horn, sounding to the charge. He gives up in despair, and passes the night tossing and rubbing his face and hands. Morning brings him relief, the enemies retire, and sleep finally closes his wearied eyelids. Of all the creatures in America the mosquito is most feared and hated." "What"  exclaimed de Garcia, laughinq heartily at Edmund's description, " do you not fear those terrible animals that roam through your forests-the bear, the tiger, and the blood- thirsty buffalo?" Edmund could scarcely suppress a smile   THE LAST OF HS NAME.      87 "The bloodthirsty  buffalo," said he, "is a peaceable, quiet animal, unless he is disturbed, and even then he will fly the hunter. Bears are rarely to be met with except in the wildest west- ern portions of the country, and as for tigers there are none, unless you give an occasional wild-cat that grim title. I see, Mr. de Garcia, you are not familiar with the natural history of America, and therefore at some future period, we will together consult a work upon that sub- ject which, I must confess, I have too much neglected. But to change the conversation to a more agreeable theme, will Miss Blanche favor me with a song? Yonder I perceive my favor- ite instrument, the harp." Blanche immediately proceeded to the harp, and after a slight'prelude, she struck the strings, and performed one of those grand northern   88    THE LAST OF HS NAME. marches, the wild harmony of which thrills the soul, and causes the heart to beat, and the eye to glisten with an unknown but powerful excite- ment. Then, suddenly changing the measure, she loudly chanted one of her father's favorite national airs. She ceased. Again she struck the chords; softly she sang a plaintive ballad of Ebba Braihe and her royal lover; and Edmund listened, his eyes glistening with tears of sym- pathy for her unhappy fate. A summons to the tea-table from Mistress Lisbeth interrupted the music. They all proceeded to the dining-room, and after supper returned to the parlor. The evening was spent at the whist-table; Mr. de Garcia and Mistress Lisbeth playing together, against Edmund and Blanche.   It is almost needless to state that the latter were invariably beaten.    THE LAST OF HS NAME.     89 The next day Edmund, with his book, en- tered the parlor at an ,early hour, and there found Blanche alone, waiting for her lesson. It was decided that each day Blanche should re- ceive two lessons, one in the forenoon and the other in the evening. As the rest of his time would be unoccupied, Edmund proposed to de Garcia, who had entered the room during their discussion, that he should assist him in superin- tending the affairss of the estate. :This proposal was at once accepted, and Edmund, although he was to give lessons to Blanche, still did not be- come a simple tutor, but was appointed steward of Blommaholme, with which title he was better satisfied. 5*   CHEAPTER    VIII. PREPARATIONS- FOR A WEDDING. EARLY Monday morning Baron -Reinhold and his wife arrived at Blormnaholme that they might participate in the next day's festival. Mrs. Lisbeth was busy in the kitchen superin- tending the arrangements for the feast, which she determined should be second to none in magnificence, unless possibly the one given in honor of her own wedding twelve years before. Greta had, with the assistance of several of her female friends from the village, prepared for herself an elegant white muslin dress, which she was finishing in, a corner of the kitchen, while   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     91 Lisbeth was bustling among the pans and kettles. "Oh, Mrs. Lisbeth," suddenly exclaimed Greta, throwing aside her work pettishy, "do come and show me how this sprig should be embroidered upon the sleeve., I am sure I have done and undone it at - least a dozen times. I shall never finish my dress unless you help me." With a good-natured " what 'a trouble you are, girl," Lisbeth took the sleeve from the almost weeping Greta, and with the skill of an experienced seamstress, commenced upon the sprig, and explained how it should be worked, until Greta fully understood it. While they were thus engaged SKlas Hans entered the kitchen. For the last week Klas had not, to use his own expression, "pulled a single oar."   92    THE LAST OF HS NAME. So elated was he with the joyful thought that his brightest anticipations would be soon realized, that labour was entirely out of the question, so he occupied his time in trying on his new suit of clothes, and practising upon the violin, that he might be perfect for the ball. He had secretly invited several of his friends who were musical in their tastes, and they had held meetings every evening in the barn, to practise -together. Klas Hans drilled them incessantly, and succeeded in forming a tolerable orchestra. One great difficulty, however, he had to surmount, and that was to quell the ardor ot the gentleman who performed upon the trom- bone. This individual, finding himself possessed of such a powerful instrument, delighted in testing its strength, and blew such vigorous blasts upon it that the music of his companions   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     93 was quite drowned in its deafening nites. The orchestra held its final meeting before the festi- val that morning, and Tlas had succeeded in ' persuading the gentleman of the trombone to blow softer, and harmony was restored between the members of the orchestra, who had heard the former efforts of their companion with little con. tent and much murmuring. This accomplished, Kla proceeded to the kitchen to counsel with Lisbeth in relation to the dancing ground. With a complacent smile the good dame turned from Greta, and gave Klas Hans a full account of the arrangements made for her own wedding, adding that she thought he could not , do better than to follow them in all particulars. So thought Klas, and he at once proceeded to follow Lisbeth's advice. By Mr. de Garcia's direction the harvesters were all' collected in   ":    THE LAST OF HS NAMER. the courtyard, to assist Klas in making the preparations for the wedding festival. Upon his return from the kitchen they greeted him with three hearty cheers, and immediately testified their willingness to place themselves under his direction. He forthwith divided them into parties, each party to perform a certain portion of the labor. Thus, one party was sent to- the mainland in search of evergreens, another to seek through the forests for a suitable pine tree for the dancing pole, and others to remain on the island to assist in erecting bowers, making tables and benches, and- laying a dancing floor upon the green. While the young men were thus -to be engaged, the damsels,-for many had been invited, from neighborhoods far and near, to attend the wedding,-as soon as they should arrive were to make wreaths and garlands of, t   THE LAST OF tIS NAME,     95 evergreens and flowers. Soon the young men were busily engaged in their respective depart- ments, and by noon, a large quantity of ever- greens from the forests on the mainshore, and flowers from Blormmaholme were collected; but unfortunately not a single lady guest had made her appearance. Poor Greta was in a constant tremor of fear. "What if they should not come at, all?"7 thought she, " no one can rnatufacture wreaths except girls, I wish they would come." She went to the garden gate and gazed upon the bay. With an exclamation of joyful surprise, she hastened -to the house and called Lisbeth,'and they both returned to the gate. Coming from the opposite shore was a line of boats, at the head of which sailed, a beautiful yacht, upon the sails of which could be read the words A' Klas ard Greta," painted in large characters and   96     THE LAST OF HS NAME. encircled by a wreath. In the wake of this little vessel followed many skiff, all occupied by gaily dressed damsels and their male attend- ants. Greta was so much surprised, that she could scarcely credit the accuracy of her eye- sight; but as Lisbeth evinced equal astonish- ment, she quickly regained her presence of mind, and sped to the court-yard to inform Klas of what she had seen. No sooner did the lover hear the news than he summoned the members of his orchestra, and hastened to the landing. As the- boats neared the wharf, at a signal from their leader the musicians performed a spirited march welcoming the guests. A broad crimson banner, with silver embroidery, was hoisted to the mast head of the yacht, and a discharge from a small cannon returned the greeting from the landing. In the beautiful vessel, which was   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     97 managed by two skilful seamen, were seated Mr. de Garcia and Blanche, and Baron Reinhold and his .wife. As a happy surprise for the faithful Greta and her lover, de Garcia, assisted by Blanche and his friend the Baron, had arranged this little plot. He had purchased the vacht a few days before, Blanche  had embroidered the banner, and sent invitations to the ladies of the surrounding country, while the Barop attended to the proper delivery of the little gilt-edged notes. So silently and carefully had they performed their labors, that none of the inmates of Blommaholme were aware of what was to happen. If Klas Hans was delighted when-he beheld this splendid spectacle in honor of his approach- ing nuptials, his joy knew no bounds when, upon the landing of the boats, Mr. de Garcia                    ..,   98    THE LAST OF HS NAME. advanced to him, and in the name of his daugh- ter requested him to accept the yacht, and from that day to consider it his own property. And now Greta had no longer any fear that the wreaths and garlands would not be completed in time. In a body the young ladies proceeded to the court-yard, and soon many busy fingers were engaged in twining the dark green branches and leaves. The arrangements were not completed until after sundown, and as the darkness prevented the youthful laborers from viewing the result of their endeavors, they ad- journed to the mansion, where they spent the evening in merry games and sports. At an early hour the guests separated for the night, all anxious for the breaking of the morning. That night Edmund Denys could not sleep. Be arose from the bed upon which he had cast   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    99 himself when he first entered the apartment, and opening the window gazed forth into the moon- light. His heart throbbed painfully, and his soul experienced a sentiment of sorrow which he himself could not explain. He had beheld the preparations for the next day's festival, but had not participated in them. Neither Blanche nor her father had requested him to -do so, and although his office as steward of the estate oc- casionally demanded his presence among the harvesters, still he did not mingle with them. He was vexed with Blanche because she had not made him acquainted with the surprise which she and her father had prepared for Tlas Hans and his betrothed.  He was vexed because the evening sports had interrupted the lesson which Blanche: would otherwise have taken, and he wast more vexed with himself, because he had   100    THE LAST OF HS NAME. not mingled with the merry-makers, instead of shutting himself in his room. "Why," thought he, ",should I not have entered into their sports? I am but a servant, and should await a formal invitation no more than my fellows. But she should, at least, have requested me to assist them; then how willingly would I have labour- ed. She thought no more of me, than she did of the humblest farm laborer. Well, I'll live here my year, and then shall return home. "What," said he suddenly, "there is a light in Blanche's room!" The window curtain in Blanche's apartment was drawn aside, and Edmund could plainly observe its fair occupant, as she sat by the win- dow, resting her head upon her hand. She turned her face towards the window of Ed- mund's apartment, and immediately arose and   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    101 extinguished her light. Involuntarily Edmund- followed her example, and both chambers were in darkness. Long did he gaze towards the spot where he had last beheld her. He wondered whether she had returned - to the window, and was almost certain that she had, for he fancied he could distinguish a dim outline of her form in the same position that she had before occu- pied. .  In spite of her assumed  gaiety, Blanche during the entire day- had experienced a feeling of despondency. She had observed Edmund's abstraction, and was grieved, she knew not why, that he had, not mingled with the sports of the day. Her father had given strict injunctions that no one should be informed, of the boating party, and as he had not seen fit to impart the secret to Edmund himself, Blanche did not feel   102    THE LAST OF HS NAME. at liberty to do so, and a sentiment of propriety which she invariably experienced when think- ing of Edmund prevented her from formally inviting him to participate in the festivities. After the guests had separated she retired to her apartment, and seated herself thoughtfully near the open window. The moon shone brightly upon the opposite wing of the mansion, in which was Edmund's apartment, while a dark shadow fell directly across her window. She glaiced towards Edmund's apartment, and, be- held its occupant. z gasi g directly into her win- dow. Involuntarily she arose and extinguished. her lamp, and, then returned to the window. By the bright beam of the moon which fed directly in Edmund's -window,: she could discern him, still seated in the same position, although he a lsQohad extinguished his light, :Why was it \o    THE LAST 9F HS NAME.    108 that she loved to gaze upon that form? She knew not herself, yet she Continued at her win- dow with her eyes fixed upon the indistinct figure in the'opposite apartment until her mantel clock struck the hour of midnight; then with a half suppressed sigh she arose, and without relighting her lamp prepared. to retire for the night. Gentle Blanche, a new sentiment had been kindled within:your heart; anovel and unknown power beamed within your breast., "In the morning," thought she, as she,pressed her cheek upon the pillow "I will invite him to join us in the festival." ,    CHAPTER IX. THE WEDDING FESTIVAL. BRIGHT and beautiful arose the sun usgering in the auspicious day. The dew still glistened upon the grass when Blanche arose, and after dressing opened the window that she might enjoy the glorious morning. She glanced to- wards the opposite wing, and, to her surprise, discovered Edmund occupying nearly the same position that he had the night before. He saw her approach her window, and ariing, saluted her with a polite bow, and immediately with- drew. Two hours afterwards the guests were assem-   THEE LASt' OF' A ii '    gAMo 1 bled in the breakfast room.

She consulted Greta; but the latter, poor child, was so bewiI- I dered and ovejoyed with all that had happened, that she- was totally incompetent to: give advice. At length she concluded to consult Klas; "'for, thought she, "wisdom sometimes' falls from the lips of folly," and in this case she acted pru- dently, for KRas immediately suggested that the gentlemen should adjourn to the barn, where, as 6   106.,   THE LAST OF HS NAME. the mow was filled with sweet fresa hay, and as the weather was warm, they, could spend the night comfortably. This plan was immediately adopted, and the gentlemen, with many laughs and jokes, arranged their beds in the hay, and succeeded in spending a pleasant night, although much murmuring and many hasty exclamations might have been heard in the mow, as the unconscious sleepers occasionally planted their feet in the faces of their neighbors. The next morning, however, all the inconveniences of the night were forgotten, and with smiling counte- nances and hay-strewn coats, the gentlemen de- scended from their novel bed-chamber and has- tened to the wash-room, where, before a long bench, upon which was placed a row of white basins, they performed their morning ablutions, and then joined the ladies at the breakfast table.   THE LAST ,OFHS NAME.    107 At nine o'clock the parson arrived, and half an hour afterwards the company assembled in the large parlors to witness the marriage. The ceremony was performed in the usual manner. KJla blushed with pleasure and fear, and felt uncomfortable in his tightly fitting wedding suit; and Greta wept, holding her handkerchief to her eyes, which example was followed by most of the ladies. At length they were happily mar- ried, and amidst the stream of noisy congratula- tions which was poured upon the young couple, Blanche found an opportunity of addressing Ed. mund, who, standing upon the threshold of the hall-door, had overlooked the scene. "Are you ill?" she inquired, "that you do not enjoy this happy assemblage!" "No," replied Edmund, coloring deeply, "I am not ill! but-* "   108    TH-E LAST QF HS lAM'E. "Oh , M.

So frankly and pleasaitly were these words pronounced that all sadness was imnmediately chased from Edmund's countenance, and with a look of joy, he proffered his arm and conducted   TII;.LAST OF ,tIS NAE.

Blanche sought her father and held a private conversation with h-. Mr. de Garcia smiled approvingly, and mounted a chair.  "Sileac?' screamed Mrs. e isbeth. In a moment all conversation ceased, and every eye was turned towards de Garcia "It is necessary," said he, "that a master of ceremonies should be appointed for the day. This important object has been overlooked; but as it is not too late, with your permission I will name Steward Denys for that office,  trust you will ratify they - Qation,"   "O    THE LAST OPF IS NAME. This little speech was greeted by a shout of approval, and Edmund was summoned to the centre of the room. Confused and startled by the sudden announcement, Edmund knew not what to say or do; but, finally, recovering his presence of mind, he requested the indulgence of the company for a few moments while he went to his apartment to draw up a programme for the day. This was at once granted, and after a short absence he returned with a slip of paper in his hand. A circle was formed around him and he read as follows: "First.--The guests shall proceed to the wharf, and there witness a rowing match be- tween three boatmen whom Mr. de Garcia shall designate. For this rowing match there shall be three prizes; first, a silver cup; second, an ele- gantly bound copy of Tegner's poems; third, a   THE LAST OF HS NAME.

'Third.-Upon their return the company shall proceed to the orchard to partake of a din- ner, which shall be prepared during their ab- sence, and this most important part of the pro- gramme is hereby intrusted to Mrs. Lisbeth. "Fourth.-After dinner the guests may sepa- rate for the purpose of making preparations for the evening. "Fifth.-At seven o'clock the company shall assemble in the orchard, and at a quarter past seven the dancing shall commence, and continue until eleven o'clock, when supper shall be served in the pavilion."   THE LAST OF HS NAME. The programme was received with great ap- plause, and the company immediately proceeded to the wharf. Here Mr. de Garcia selected three boatmen for the rowing match-Dedrik Baptist, the son of a neighboring farmer,' Arnulf Esay, a fisherman, and Crist Krispin, a shoemaker. Dedrik and Arnulf were two manly looking youths, tall and well formed, and both were ex- perienced boatmen. Crist Krispin, however, was short and squat; his hair red and thick, and his eyes glancing in an angle across the top of his little turned-up nose. His broad mouth was always smiling, and he possessed a spirit of vanity too large by far for his insignificant bulk. Blanche stepped forward, and presented a white scarf to Dedrik, a blue one to Arnulf, and a crimson one to Krispin. These scarfs the competitors bound around their heads, and strip-    O   "8   ping off their jackets they entered their respec- tive boats. The two boats propelled by Dedrik and Arnulf darted from the wharf, amidst the cheers of the spectators; but Kr'ipin by some mischance lost one of his oars overboard, and while he was fishing for it, his rivals had gained a considerable start. At length the shoemaker recovered his ai, and seating himself com- menced rowing violently, and followed by en- couraging shouts, from the shore he laboriously proceeded in. the wake of the preceding boats. In the meantime Arnulf and Dedrik had rowed side by side, neither gaining a decided advan- tage. They touched the opposite shore at nearly the same instant, and turning commenced their return. They arrived at about the centre of the bay, and now the race became exciting, for they were plainly visible from the wharf 6*  "4    TTHE LAST OF HS NAME. "The blue is ahead!" shouts a friend of Arnulf. "No, there comes the white," contra- diets a comrade of Dedrik. Arnulf will win," says one. "The cup is Dedrik's," cries another, and noy all distinction is lost in a general up- roar of voices encouraging their respective fa- vorites. The boats near the shore, casting the brine from their sharp bows in a white foaming cataract; the rowers redouble their efforts, the shouts upon the wharf increase, and amidst the general cheering Arnulf's boat shoots half a length beyond his rival, and its keel grates upon the sand. Dedrik, with a good-natured shake of his head, ceases rowing, and Arnulf is declared victor. ":But where is Crist Krispin?" inquired Dedrik, as soon as he had landed. All eyes were turned towards the middle of the bay, where   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     115 was discovered Krispin's boat lying motionless. Its unfortunate occupant had tied his crimson head-dress to an oar, and as a signal of distress was waving it in the air. Dedrik immediately re-entered his boat and hastened to Krispin's as* sistance. He discovered that the little shoe- maker hadlost one of his oars, and unable to return had hung out his flag of distress. He cast a line to Krispin, and after it was fastened, he towed the boat to the wharf. "Ah, if I had not lost my oar," said Krispin, as he mounted the wharf. , "Nevertheless, Krispin," said. a laughing friend, "you have won the best prize of the three-the garland, man; who shall weave it?" Now it happened that Krispin was deeply in love with a bright black-eyed miss, Marie Sul- pice, the daughter of a wealthy farmer. Marie   THE LAST OF HS NAME. did not return the shqemaker's passion; on the contrary she detested him, more, it was whisper- ed, that she was to be betrothed to Arnulf. This, Krispin in his vanity would not believe; and as he was entitled to a wreath woven by the hand. of the lady he should choose, he in- sisted that iMarie Sulpice should weave the flower garland in time for him to wear it that evening at the hall. As Krispin insisted upon his rights, the company decided  that Marie should weave the wreath. "So be it," said Marie. "At the dinner table I will crown Crist Krispin with a wreath, which shall compare with the respect I feel for him." Krispin felt himself elevated to the very sky, in his happiness at Marie's words, and kneeling at her feet he attempted to kiss her hand, which Arnlf perceiving, quickly sub-   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    117 stituted his own, and received upon it a hearty smack from  the shoemakers lips, although Krispin, not observing his mistake, could not but marvel at its roughness. This incident was observed by the bystanders, and a roar of laughter followed; but the uncon- scious Krispin, slowly arising, said with the r utmost dignity: "A man who is ashamed of his love, is no man," a sentiment which was re- ceived with renewed laughter. The sound of music now summoned the guests to the boats, and soon a'line of skiff con- taining the ladies and gentlemen was formed, and, preceded by the yacht in which. were the musicians, they slowly proceeded around the island. At the seaward side they landed upon the beach, and the company amused themselves by picking up sea shells, skipping pebbles upon   "8    THE LAST OF HS NAME. the surface of the water, holding consultations over dead crawfish, leaping, pitching quoits, and committing all the extravagances that are usually enacted when a party of merry people visit the sea-shore. At three o'clock in the afternoon the boats arrived at the dock, and with appetites freshened by their ride over the water, and their exertions on the beach, the guests hastened to the orchard. In the orchard, upon a level spot of ground, had been laid a dancing floor, in the centre of which was a high pole, decorated with ribbons and flags. Around the floor were placed rough board seats, divided by four aisles at regu- lar intervals from ,each other. At the en- trance of each of these aisles were erected bowers of evergreens, ornamented with flowers, and hung with parti-colored paper lanterns. lei   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     119 These bowers were the entrances to the danc- ing floor. In the rear of the dancing floor an immense structure of evergreens   arose. It contained a semicircular table, of sufficient size to accommodate all the guests, and from the ceiling was suspended a rude wooden chande- lier, duly provided with wax candles. This structure was called the pavilion. But the pavilion and the dancing floor were to be reserved for the evening; therefore Lisbeth had arranged the dinner at the further extremity of the orchard, beneath the shade of several large apple, trees, where a rough table had been erected. To this spot the company at once pro- ceeded. De Garcia took the head of the table, placing upon his right hand the bride and bridegroom, and upon his left the Baron and his wife. Edmund seated himself at the opposite           P   THE LAST OF HS NAME.         : end of the table, supported on the right by Blanche, and on the left by Mrs. Lisbeth. The guests seated themselves upon wooden benches before the table, and at once a desperate onslaught was made upon the good things that Lisbeth had bountifully provided. The centre of the table was ornamented with a lofty bride- cake, made in the form of a castle, and crusted with white sugar.  In its miniature window appeared sugar Cupids holding little banners, and bows and arrows in their hands, and at the foot of the cake reposed an elegantly bound volume upon which was placed a silver cup, with slips of paper bearing the, names of the winners at the rowing, etc.   At either extremity of the table were huge steaming tureens of soup, flanked by rosed turkeys and piUtis of mutton, intm led rthe iitshe of     jellies and preserved fruits. All in all, the dinner was an excellent one, and worthy of its cook and superintendent, 'Mrs. Lisbeth. By chance, Crist Krispin seated himself directly opposite the bridecake, and no sooner had he detected the prizes, than he shouted at the top of his lungs, "Where is Marie Sulpice, and where is my wreath ?" Marie, who, deeply engaged in conversation with Arnulf, had entirely forgotten Krispin and his wreath, hastily arose, and left the table. After a brief absence she returned bearing some, thing -which she concealed beneath her apron, and approaching Krispin without his know- ledge, she suddenly placed a wreath upon his head. A shout of merriment arose, and Krispin, suspecting foul play, tore the garland from his brow, and to his dismay discovered that   122    THE LAST OF HS NAME, it was formed of gorgeous sun-flowers inter twined with cabbage and beet leaves. For s moment he held it in the air, then dashing it tc 'the earth, he calmly resumed his spoon, and sought consolation in a dish of fragrant soup. Poor Krispin was evidently accustomed tc such practical jokes from the mistress of his heart; but in his blindness he believed they originated only in her great love for him, which she fain would conceal. So, while the others laughed, he chuckled inwardly, and cast loving glances from his soup to the mischievous Marie. After the dishes were removed, coffee, wine, and cigars were introduced, and as it was in the open air, the ladies, upon the urgent entreaties of the gentlemen, remained at the table. We will not speak of the toasts, the jokes, the anec-   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     123 dotes that were related, the songs that were sung, and the wine that was drunk, but we will say that amidst them all, Crist Krispin quite for- got his troubles, and even volunteered a song, which, we need not add, was enthusiastically applauded. The dinner was concluded, and the guests hastened to prepare for the ball. The ladies went to their rooms to dress their hair, change their dresses, arrange their jewelry, and some, it is said, went to rouge their faces while others to chalk their cheeks and foreheads, which the-hot sun and much exertion had rendered too fresh and blooming to appear interesting. However that may be, at least, the ladiebs eft the parlor, and  the doors were then  carefully locked to prevent their too sudden entrance, while the gentlemen proceeded with  their toilets.

It would be useless to dwell upon the incidents  the ball, of the supper, or of the departure of the guests; therefore we will at once bid adieu to the gay wedding company at Blommaholme.   CHAPTER X. THE, GAME OF CHESS. Six months had elapsed after the marriage of Greta and Klas Hans. Each day had Blanche received a lesson from her teacher, and each day her heart had become warmer towards him, until at length she felt within her soul that she loved him. Edmund also felt the 'tender paeans of love within his heart, and yet neither he nor Blanche suspected each other's sentiments. Summer had surrendered'ther throne towin ter; the bay was now frozen, and the island was covered with a mantle of snow. The inmates of Blommaholme rareiy left the mansion, and as a /   ,   126    THE LAST OF HS NkAME.. cheerful companion, with whom to wile away the dreary winter days and nights, Mr. de Garcia found Edmund  invaluable. He apparently treated him as a son, and Edmund felt, that if he only possessed Blanche's heart, her father's consent to their union would speedily follow. But how should he discover Blanche's senti- ments towards him? She had never by word or motion evinced more than esteem and friend- ship; yet he fancied he read in her deep eye an expression which his longing heart would have construed favorably to his hopes. One stormy evening, after Mr. de Garcia, who complained of a severe headache, had re- tired to his apartment, Edmund and Blanche were seated together at the chess-board. Both were experienced players, and they appeared more than usually interested. At the comrn 4   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    127 mencement of the game, a singular idea had pre- sented itself to Blanche so vividly, that she could not but believe it reality. She fancied that in this game of chess she had staked a wager higher than the mere pleasure of winning.  She thought that should she win, she might be sure that Ed- mund loved her, andif she lost --, she dared not continue the thought. So strongly was this fancy impressed upon her mind that she devoted her every energy to the game-to her it was a game of life and death. And it happened, as they continued playing, and as Edmund observed Blanche's extreme and unusual carefulness, that he also became imbued wth 'a similar fancy. Should he be beaten in the game, he felt that he could not hope for Blanche's love. It was a strange game, hearts were the wagers, and love the incitement. For   128    TEH: LAST OF feIS NAME. hour they boitintted; no words were spoken save an occasional check. Blanche's' face was deathly pale, And a cold perspiration beaded Edmund's bro.  The clock  struck eleven. ,d0iicl,"' said Blanche, the crimson returning to her cheeks, and her heart beating with hope. Edmund moved his piece, and carefully awaited Blanche es hrit attack. With an air of triumph, she plarided her queen* checking Edmund's king. "Check-math," she said; but with a quick move- ment Edmund took her piece withi his knight, whose. position Blanche had not discovered. She sighed deeply, and again studied the squares of the board. She advanced a pawn. "Check- mate!" cried Edmund, exultingly, springing a trap which he had long prepared to ensnare her poor king.  Oh, Edmund" excainre Blanche sorrow-   fully, and placing her forehead upon the board she wept tears of bitter disappointment. It was the first time she had addressed him thus. The truth flashed upon his mind. In an instant he was upon his knees before her, and her hand was clasped in his. "Blanche, dear Blanche," cried he, "for. give me." Blanche looked upon him, and her team fell thick and fast upon his upturned face; but they were tears of joy. "Blanche, my own Blanche, speak, dare I love you?"   A slight pressure of the hand was his only answer; but it was sufficient, and he covered her ips with burning kisses. "Will Mr. Denys please to inform me," said a voice, strangely calm, from the doorway, "why   180    THE LAST OF H NAME. he thus conducts himself in my ouse? Blanche, arise. Go to your room. Mr. Denys, follow me; I would have a few moments' conversation with you."  "Father," entreated Blanche, " do not "Be silent, and retire," replied Mr. de Garcia, sternly. "Will you accompany me; Mr. De- nys?" Edmund clasped Blanche's hand, and reas- sured by a warm returning pressure, he obeyed de Garcia's summons, and followed him to his apartment. Blanche retired to her apartment, and cast herself upon the sofa. Her first impulse was to weep; but woman's pride conquered, and si- lently she sat and meditated. "And Edmund loves me," thought she. "How strange! I never before thought of that until this evening. He   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    131 knows that I return his love. Oh, that he had known it before, then, perhaps,-but my father has always been kind to him,--why was he so sten to-night? Oh, I fear he is angry with us both; and now poor Edmund must suffer. My father must permit and sanction our love. To- morrow I will see him, and entreat him to pardon us, and to bless our love. He will, my heart tells me so." Kneeling before her little bed, Blanche fervently prayed that her most ardent wishes might be realized; then, with a lightened heart and joyful anticipations, she laid her cheek upon the pillow. "You have succeeded," said de Garcia, as he entered his room, followed by Edmund, t' in rob- bing me of Mny only treasure. That you have en- snared my daughter within your nets I am cer- tain, for did she not return your sentiments she   132    THE LAST OF HS NAME. would not ha ve permitted those familiarities, those insults, both to myself and to the memory of her mother. - Blanche, my child, how much I loved youl You shall wed my daughter, sir." "Oh, sir, how can H-?" "Listen, and then speak," interrupted de Garcia, harshy, " the dearest hope of my heart you have annihilated. She, I hoped, would have brought happiness to the heart of a son of my dearest friends. Young and inexperienced asp she is, I have kept her from the world, from the society of young men, until in an evil hour you entered my house. And how have you repaid me for my hospitality, my friendship? By tar- nishing the brilliancy of my brightest jewel. But the die is cast, you have won her from me, unjustly and dishonorably I think; but still she is yours. To-morrow is the Sabbath, and then   THE LAST OF HS NAME.   183 your banns shall be first published.

"Above all earthly things," said Edmund warmly, "I love your daughter, and would call her wife, but I trust"-,  "Enough, I will hear no more," interrupted de Garcia abruptly, ':go, avoid my presence until the day of your marriage. Upon the morning of that day I have business to transact with you. I will myself apprise Blanche of my determination, and will also attend to the pre- liminaries of your wedding." Once more Edmund attempted to conciliate the incensed father; but a stern "leave me," compelled him to desist, and with a heavy heart   134 .   THE LA; OF HS NAME. he slowly proceeded to his apartment. When the sound of Edmund' footsteps had ceased in the hall, Mr. de Garcia arose from his chair and paced the floor with hasty strides. The evil demon which had slumbered within his breast since the last illness of }is wife, was now awak- ened, and raged with ten-fold power. "This very night," said he fiercely, "she shall know the evil she has brought upon herself. But," he ' continued, thoughtfully, "if she will promise to relinquish her love for this man, and to prepare to receive the attentions of another, then I will forgive her; will take her back to my heart again." Lifting the lamp from the table, he hastened to Blanche's room, and knock- ed loudly upon the door. His knock received no reply, and opening the door he entered the room. Suddenly awakened by the light of the \   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    185 lamp, Blanche-arose in her bed and gazed wildly upon her father's face, so pale and ghastly that she could scarcely believe him an inhabitant of earth. "Fear nothing, Blanche,' said he coldly, "but listen while I speak. You have this night for the first time caused your father the deepest sorrow. You have listened to the honeyed words of a stranger, and have believed them; but, Blanche, trust not in the words of that man. I have not come to upbraid you, but I have come to tender forgiveness-yet to receive that for- giveness you must promise me sacredly that you will not marry this man; that you will not love him." "Father," replied Blanche, earnestly, "with- out your consent I will never wed Edmund Denys; but I cannot promise you that I will cease loving him.   186    THE LAST OF BIS NAME. "But you must promise me that, and more- you must tell him that you no longer love him; to his very face-you must say that you believe him false." "That, my father, I shall never do," said Blanche firmly. "Justice and your own heart tell you that it would be wronging him deeply should I do so. Oh, father, ask not that of me." The tears coursed down her cheeks, and her eyes were cast with a glance of piteous entreaty upon the stony face of her stern father. "Then, hear me," exclaimed he violently. "You shall wed him; but the day of your mar- riage will be the last you shall spend beneath my roof. Think upon my words, and to-morrow morning I will come for an answer." Unheeding Blanche's tears and half uttered entreaty, her father left her apartment. That * '   THE LAST OF HS NAM.     137 night, three inmates of the mansion, at least, were wakeful. Upon his return to his room Mr. de Garcia retired to his bed, but fruitless were his endeavors to sleep. From his heart a voice spoke, telling him that his conduct and his in- tentions were unbecoming to a father or to a man. But anger and pride combined, prevented him from listening to the warnings of that voice, and he spent the night in a constant battle be- tween his good and evil inclinations. Edmund, without disrobing, had cast himself upon his bed. Disappointment, mingled with a sentiment akin to joy, filled his heart. The ,words of de Garcia, "you shall wed my daugh- ter," continually sounded in his ear; but the conditions of deo Garcia's consent caused him in- tense pain. That BpAnche loved her father most tenderly he well knew, and that he should bet 7*  S   138    THE LAST OF HS NAME. the cause of an estrangement between the parent and the child, grieved him to his heart. Yet he hoped that Blanche would be able to pacify her father, and obtain not only his consent, for that was already given, but his forgiveness. Through the entire night was, his mind disturbed with a thousand fears and hopes, and he longed for the morning that everything might be decided. After her father had left the room, Blanche arose, and wrapping a shawl around her shoulders seated herself before the fire-place; in which the embers were still glowing., Her heart was so full and oppressed that she could not arrange her flitting thoughts; she gazed upon the coals without fairly realizing the position in which she was placed. As she looked upon  the smouldering embers, she fancied, as they changed their colors and           ........................    THE LAST OF HS NAME.     139' positions, that they represented the scenes that Edmund had once so vividly described to her. She could distinguish the forest, and a dark line through the centre of the glowing mass, in her eyes assumed the appearance of the gushing river. A solitary cricket beneath the hearth- stone commenced piping his tiny song, and assisted to complete the illusion. In his notes Blanche fancied she heard the melodious insects of an American autumn, and her heart involun- tarily longed to visit that far-distant but loved country, the native land of her beloved Ed. mund. She sighed deeply, and now the spell\ was broken, the embers sank beneath their ashes, and the fire-place was dark and deserted. 'She arose, and proceeding to a small table, mechanically opened a book.   It was her mother's bible. She lighted her night lamp,   .                .:   "O    THE LAST OF HS NAME. and seating herself by the table glanced upon the pages of the sacred, book. The first words that met her eyes were,- "Whither thou goest, I will go: and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God: where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but death part thee and me.'"The tears trickled -down her cheeks. "Oh, my mother," said she, " would that you were yet on earth. You would advise-me which way to go, and have you not?" exclaimed she suddenly, "did you not say, obey your father? I will. I shall refuse to wed Edmund; but more I cannot do. O my father, my heart will break I " At early dawn Mr. de Garcia knocked at Blanche's door. She rose from the chair which she had occupied the entire night, and admitted ' ' s o           W    THE LAST OF HS NAME.    141 him. Her eyes were swollen and inflamed, and the leaves of the open bible were bedewed with her tears. "Have you considered upon my words?" inquired her father coldly. "I have, my father," replied Blanche with quivering lips, " and have determined to say to Edmund that I cannot wed him.   Will that suffice?" "Thus far you have done well," said, he; "but you must do more, you must say that you love him not; that you wish him gone." "Father, I cannot tell a falsehood." "Girl," exclaimed  her father  quickly, "have you forgotten the words of your dying mother?" "No, I have not, and would obey you in all things; but I cannot speak a falsehood. I   "2    THE LAST OF HS NAME. will tell Mr. Denys, that it is for our mutual welfare that he should leave us, and-forget me. More, I cannot, -I shall not do." "And disobey your sainted mother, and set at naught my commands?" "My mother never bade me disobey the commands of my heavenly Father; and you, my only earthly parent, cannot, dare not command me to do so." "Enough, I will hear no more," said her father, enraged- at her words, "consider yourself the betrothed of Edmund Denys. This day your banns shall be announced in the church. Three weeks from to-morrow, you shall be married; in the meantime I advise you to pre- pare for your wedding, and until then speak not to me upon the subject."    CHAPTER XI. THE NIGHT- OF TERBOR. THE family met at the breakfast table, and Mrs. Lisbeth perplexed her brain in wondering what was the cause of the unusual gloominess of her master, and of the dejection and sorrow of Blanche and Edmund. In vain were her various onjectures. Several times she essayed to open a lively conversation; but her endeavors met with such little success, that she also became peevish, and several times betrayed her vexation by spilling the contents of the coffee cups upon the white table cloth. It would have been as well, perhaps, had she thus' disposed of the entire   "4    THE LAST OF HS NAME. contents of the coffee-urn, for neither Blanche, Edmund, nor Mr. de Garcia, tasted of the fra- grant beverage, in the manufacture of which Lisbeth greatly prided herself. Rolls, eggs, and ham shared the same fate, and in her sympathy for her companions Lisbeth quite lost her own appetite. Immediately after breakfast de Garcia left the house, and did not return until evening, when instead of joining the family at the tea- table, he bade ]Mrs. Lisbeth take some toast and tea to his own room. Upon her father's departure Blanche went to the sitting-room, where she was soon joined by Edmund, and the lovers now had an opportunity of interchanging their sentiments. Blanche could not but think that her father would for- give and receive them both as children ; but   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    145 Edmund could not imagine that he would thus play with the affection of a daughter, and as he was also acquainted with the fact that de Garcia had"intended to wed his daughter to another, he thought that he was sincere in his avowed deter- mination. Blanche was not aware of her father's former hopes and desires, and her lover thought it inexpedient to inform her of them. That day Edmund received from Blanche an avowal which caused his heart to beat with joy; although he felt that the sacrifice she would be obliged' to make for his sake, would cost her much pain, yet he hoped to alleviate, and finally to banish that pain, by lifetime of devotion and love. He pictured in glowing colors the beauties of his native land, and Blanche's countenance beamed with animation and hope as he described with fervid language their future home. He spoke of vr', *   "6    THE LAST OF HS NAME. his sister Mary, and as he read her tender letter, Blanche's eyes filled with tears of sympathy, and she longed to press the affectionate girl to her heart and call her sister. The day was spent in mingled happiness and sorrow; joy that they were soon to be united for ever, and grief that one whom  they would ever cherish and love, was estranged from them. Thus it ever is on earth, at the very moment when we imagine we taste pure joy, disappointment and sorrow lurk behind the curtain; but to the guileless heart, sorrow adds zest to joy, and disappointment brings forth renewed hopes for the future. When Lisbeth entered de Garcia's room with the tea-service, that evening, he bade her be seated. "We are to have another wedding," said he. Mrs. Lisbeth elevated her hands in astonish-   THE LAST OF HS NAME,    147 ment. "Three weeks from to-morrow," con- tinued he, "my daughter is to be married to Steward Denys." "That is good news," said Lisbeth, her eyes glistening with joy, " for I have never known a couple better suited to each other, and I was"- "In the meantime, Lisbeth," interrupted de Garcia, "I wish you to assist my daughter in preparing for her departure." "Her departure!" echoed Lisbeth, all asto- nishment. "Yes, the day of her wedding is the last she shall spend in my house. She has disgraced my name, and the memory: of her mother, and after  that day she is no longer my child." "Mr. de Garcia," said Lisbeth energetically, "what mean you? You consent to your daugh. ter's marriage, and then disown her."   "8    THE LAST OF HS NAME. "I am alone responsible for my own actions," replied de Garcia gloomily. "Yes," ejaculated Lisbeth, "you are respon- sible for your own actions, and should you do this thing God will hold you responsible. In my opinion, Mr. de Garcia, you are about to do that which will cause you sorrow throughout your whole life. Listen to me, and take them both as your children." "Never." '"Then, sir, you are a monster, sir, I say a monster!" screamed Lisbeth, her face purpling with indignation, and the frills of her cap trem- bling as she shook with anger. "No longer will I boast that I was born under the roof of a family whose sole survivor is such a wretch. Consider me no longer in your service, sir. You will break my young mistress's heart, you will, and   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     149 -and-."  Here Lisbeth's voice failed her, and choling and sobbing, she fled from the room. "The old vixen!" muttered de Garcia, "I thought that she at least would not condemn me. During her whole lifetime she has been supported and protected by my family, and now she also turns from me. What shall I do? Shall I relent and take them back to me? Shall I go to Denys, and say, 'Oh, Steward Denys, accept my apology for the hard words I have said to you, and do, I entreat you, accept the hand of my daughter? '; Never, my heart has now no feeling of love for her. Oh, that she was not my daughter! Cursed be the hour that she was born to me. I Had a son been pre- sented me in her stead, then all this trouble and pain would never have befallen me., Her mother was ever a sentimental, foolish woman,   150    THE LAST OF HS NAME. and Blanche has followed her example closely. Well, let her go, I'm not old yet; perhaps I can find another woman, a sensible one, whom I may wed, and then, mayhap, I shall not die without at heir. I will form new associations, and. will forget that I ever knew a Blanche. Yet, Blanche was a faithful and affectionate wife to me, and how did I return her love and fidelity? By heaping gall upon her life, and finally bringing her to the grave. Oh, God, that she was yet alive I By a whole lifetime of love would I repay her for the affection she once placed upon me.  Forgive mei Blanche, my wife, forgive me." The suffering man cast him- self upon his knees, and clasping his hands, looked upwards with streaming eyes, as if seek- ing the form of his sainted wife. Suddenly a scowl darkened his brow, and with a curse at *   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     151 his foolish soft-heartedness, he arose and paced the floor with rapid strides. His eyes flashed wildly, and his lips were firmly compressed. At this moment the door opened. Blanche entered the room, and fell upon her knees at her father's feet. "Arise, simpletonl Ileave the room," ex- claimed de Garcia violently.  "Why do you come here? You think that because your silly face resembles your mother's, I will receive you; but no, no, you have reckoned without your host. Go, gol" Blanche trembled violently at her father's words, ,but did not arise from  her kneeling posture.  "Up, up, I say," cried de Garcia, thoroughly excited, "I will force you to leave me," and he placed his hand roughly upon her shoulder.   THE LAST OF HS NAME. With a faint cry Blanche fell forward, fainting, to the floor. Her temple struck upon a chair, inflictin a wound which bled profusely. Edmund, who, in the hall, was awaiting the result of the interview, heard Blanche's cry, and instantly entered the apartment. He saw- Blanche extended upon the floor; her face corpse-like and sprinkled with crimson. The blood rushed to his brain. "Villain!" he ex. claimed, and sprang upon the father, who, stupi fled with horror, gazed upon the inanimate form of his daughter, gone, he thought, to become a companion to her murdered mother. "Edmund," cried Blanche, suddenly re- vlving, and slowly arising to her feet, "do no violence to my father." She staggered, and would have fallen to the floor had not Edmund caught her in his arms Again she had fainted   THE LAST OF HS NlAME.   --Edmund rang the bell loudly, and the sum- mons was quickly answered by Lisbeth, in whose arms he placed the senseless form of the afflicted maiden. The tears showered from Lis. beth's eyes as she conveyed her beloved mistress from the presence of her brutal father.. "Mr. Denys will, I doubt not," sneered de Garcia, who, upon perceiving that Blanche was not dead, had recovered his usual coolness, "give me the satisfaction that one gentleman should tender to another after an insult so base as this. I am not accustomed to the epithet villain." "Then, sir," replied Edmund, hotly, "it is not because you are undeserving of it." "As you please, sir; to-morrow morning, if you have no objection, I will meet you upon the beach at the landing. At six o'clock, precisely.    tg4    THE LAST OF BIS NAME. I need not advise you to keep the knowledge of our intended meeting to yourself. After to- morrow, sir, the iland shall be known by its old name, Retribution Isle. Good evening, Mr. Denys."         " Edmund instantly left the apartment. Al- most hearthroken at the sudden calamity which had befthen him, he cast himself upon his bed and wept bitterly. His tears relieved his aching mind, and erhausted with fatigue and excite- ment, he fell into a profound slumber. De Garcia could not sleep. His brain was filed with a thousand contending thoughts. He had extinguished his light before he had retired, uand the darkness of the room was oppressive to him. He would have re-lighted the lamp; but a strange and unnatural fear came upon him, and he buried his face in the blankets as if to shut   THE :LAST OF Hs NXME. out some horrible vision.  His eyeballs ached deep in their' sockets, and his head seemed : full to bursting. His ears were filled with a strange buzzing, in  which he fancied he could distinguish the sound of harsh discordant music. The per- spiration stood upon his forehead in heavy drops, and his breathing was labored and diffi- oult. -In vain did he strive to direct his wan- dering thoughts to one subject. ,Feverish fancies flitted athwart his mind. "Air," he gasped. I must have air!"With a strong' effort he arose from his bed-and tottered towards the win- dow. His strength failed him, and With a heavy groan he fell to the floor senseless. Awakened by the -noise produced by de Garida's fall, Ed- mund started from the bed, and hastened into the hall. He heard low groans proeeding fronm de Garcia's apartment, and quicly uiwwa^ned   THE LAST OF HS NAME. Lisbeth, who was watching in Blanche's room, and they both proceeded to de Garcia's apart- ment. Lisbeti first entered the room, and as her eyes fell upon the prostrate form of her master, she uttered a scream of terror, and dropped the lamp from her hand. Guided through the darkness by the groans of the suffer- ing man, Edmund, who had prepared his mind for a horrible event, groped his way towards the window. At this moment K1as Hans and Greta, who had been aroused by the confusion, entered the door. Greta held a candle aloft in her hand, and a startling scene was presented to the eyes of the terrified spectators. Lying upon the floor near the window was Mr. de Garcia; his coun- tenance deathly pale, his eyes half closed, his mouth gaping, and his lips bleeding from wounds inflicted by his teeth. Kneeling beside him was     THE LAST OF HS NAME.      15 Edmund, with his arm encircling the neck of the prostrate man, in the act of raising him from the floor. - In a distant corner crouched Lisbeth, her face concealed by her apron, and her whole form trembling with terror. Klas Hans and Greta, shrouded in their night clothes, pale with fright, and shivering with cold, gazed upon the scene, and completed the picture. At the appearance of the light, Lisbeth left her place of refuge, and, with her assistance, Edmund gently placed de Garcia upon the bed. He opened his eyes and looked wildly around the apartment. His gaze fell upon Edmund. "You here ["' he shouted with renewed en- ergy; "leave me, and you also," he continued more calmly, turning to Lisbeth, "you may also leave me. Yonder is faithful Greta, she will not desert her old master. Come hither."     1^08  THE.4,A  OBH- ISW NI4AVS eretA approached the bed side Taking her hand de Garcia stroked it tenderly;. u4 iy good Klas, you must allow your wife to watch with me to-night.; I am- ill, very ill Are you not gone yet?" he exclaimed loudly, perceiving, that Edmund and Lisbeth. atilt lingered in the room. "If you would not drive me mad, leave me." Perceiving that their presence exasperated him, Edmund beckoned to Lisbet, and followed by Klas, they silentlyleft the room. In the hall Edmund whispered: a few directions to las, and returned to his own apartment to spend the night in sleepless anxiety. Lisbeth resumed her seat by the bedside of Blanche, who, sleeping pro- foundly, had not been disturbed by the ravings of her father, and Klas hastened' to his own room to procure suitable clothing- for his wife Greta, who was to watch with her suffering master.   CHAPTER XII. THE DEPARTURE. DURING the ensuing two months de Garcia was confined to his bed. For one week the physician remained with him night and day, and it was not until the eighth day that he pro nounced the sick man out of danger. Greta, who was unaware of the origin of his illnes, watched over him with tender care, and Klas assisted the physician when necessary, in the performance of his duty. Poor Blanche also was confined to her room; but under the skil- ful and; affectionate care of Lisbeth, she did not require the presence of the physician. Edmund,   160    THE LAST OF HS NAME. lonely and mournful, wandered about the estate during the hours of the day, waiting impatiently for the coming of evening that he might hear Lisbeth's report concerning the health of the mistress of his heart. It was a cold and stormy morning, one week before the intended wedding of Blanche and Ed- mund, that de Garcia left his room, and sought Edmund's apartment. His countenance was pale, and bore strong traces of his recent illness; but his eye sparkled with its former brilliancy. Without knocking he entered the Steward's apartment. Edmund was seated before the fire- place gazing abstractedly upon the burning coals. At the sound of de Garcia's footsteps he arose, and with a conciliatory smile extended his hand. De Garcia refused the hand thus frankly tendered in reconciliation, and mutely pointed   TE LAST OF HS NAME.    161 towards the chair. With a sigh,' Edmund re. sumed his seat. "Mr. Denys," commenced de Garcia, "is probably aware of the causes that prevented our intended meeting, and which I am afraid," he extended his thin hand, which trembled violent- ly, " will still prevent it; but of that enough, perhaps it is better that we did not meet. Blanche, I understand, has sufficiently recovered to participate next Monday in a ceremony in which you are somewhat interested. I have come  to you this morning to transact some business which I intended to postpone until next Monday; but as I am to leave Blommaholme to. morrow, to visit my  friend the baron, and am not to return until the latter part of next week, I   have thought fit to come to you to-day. From her mother Blanche received a  legacy,   i6a    TH HA1ST .OF HA WA. which she intrusted to my keeping. I am now  no longer my daughter's protector, for. I disown her You, sir, are the only person in whom she ca find protection. I, this packet you will find certain valuable papers and jewels, the pro- perty of your betrothed Wife." He placed in Edmund's hand a eald package. "And now, sir, I suppose it will be useless for me to say that upon my return I hope to find yourself and wife no longer occupants of my house." Thus caying he abruptly departed, before Edmund could find words to answer him. "Strange and unfortunate man," thought Ed- mund, "how much do your actions contradict each other I'  The next morning at an early hour de Garcia departed from Blommaholme, after placing in Qrt's hand a letter which he bade   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    163 her deliver to Blanche. That morning Blanche, for the first time since her illness, had left her apartment. In the parlor she met Edmund, who gave her the package intrusted to him by her father, at the same time repeating his last words. "Dear Edmund," said Blanche, with quiver- ing lips and glistening eyes, "these then are from my mother. Little did she think that her child would see so much misery." "Blanche, my own Blanche," said Edmund, "do not speak thus to me; your every word  conveys a reproach, for I am the sole cause of your sorrow." "No, Edmund, not you, for my heart assures me that my dear mother, were she yet on earth, would sanction and approve our love; but my father, Edmund, I cannot think of him without weeping'!   THE LAST OF HS NAME. heir conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Greta, who approached her young nistress and presented a letter. Blanche in- stantly broke the seal, and after Greta had leparted, she read aloud, as follows: BLANCHE: "This day I leave Blomma- holme, not to return until after you and your future husband have ceased to become its in- mates. You can understand my motives for absenting myself upon the occasion of your wed- ding. Mr. Denys has received my last instruc- tions. If I have sinned against you, my daughter, pardon me; this much my pride will not allow me to say to Mr. Denys. When you have left Blommaholme, and  are among strangers in a distant land, the home of your betrothed, think sometimes of him who once   THE LAST OF HS NAME.   165   was your father. I cannot take you back as my daughter now; it would humiliate me before your future husband; that I cannot, I shall not submit to. Therefore, Blanche, if you would have me at peace with you, and would receive my blessing instead of my curse, leave Blomma- holme immediately after your wedding; but do not go before. Greta and Klas must witness the ceremony, that they may tell me of it upon my return. "Adieu, Blanche, for ever. "R. DE GARCIA." Pearly drops fell from Blanche's eyes upon the paper, which was already blotted with her father's tears.  "We shall remain," said Edmund, his coun- tenance beaming with animation and hope, "we will postpone our wedding until he returns. By '    THE LAST OF HS. NAME. is words in the letter I see that he has forgiven you, and that nothing but pride prevents him from pardoning me also." "Oh, Edmund, you do not know him. If we should remain his anger would increase ten- fold. I thank God that my father has written this letter, for it has removed a heavy weight from off my heart. Next Monday, Edmund, I am thy wife. Then we will open the package." The lovers separated. Blanche went to her apartment, and Edmund proceeded to the kitchen to converse' with Mrs. Lisbeth. He found her watching Greta as she was making arrangements for dinner. Since the first night of de Garcia's illness, Lisbeth had considered herself no longer in his employment. She had discharged herself from his service. But unwilling to resign her important charge to the inexperienced Qeta at   once, and wishing to attend Blanche's wed- ding,. she thought fit to remain a short time longer. "Ah, Lisbeth," said Edmund, so cheerfully, that the good lady opened wide her eyes in as- tonishment, "I am glad I have found you. We must have a little conversation together." "What has happened, Mr. Steward?" in- quired Dame Lisbeth, "has 1r. de Garcia repented of his sins, and forgiven Miss Blanche, and requested me to resume my duties as house- keeper?" "Hle has certainly forgiven Miss Blanche," replied Edmund, "but so far from having asked you to remain, that I think one of his highest hopes is that you will leave his house." "And has it come to this?" sobbed Lisbeth. "Miss Blanche and you are to remain and be  THE LAST OF HS NAME. happy, while I, who was born-no matter, it is always the way with the world. Gratitude is a rare plant!" "But you have not heard all," said Edmund. "Miss de Garcia is forgiven solely upon condi- tion that she leaves Blommaholme, and I am to accompany her, although her father has neglected to pardon me. So, Mrs. Lisbeth, knowing your experience and skilfulness, and feeling that my future wife needs a careful teacher and a kind companion, I have come to you to ask you to go with us." "To America?" questioned Lisbeth, ear- nestly. "Yes," replied Edmund, "to America, my home; where you shall find a cordial welcome, and perhaps something which will suit you better."   'Yes, who knows " murmured Lisbeth ab- stractedly. Lisbeth quickly gae her consent, and Ed- mund returned to the parlor, where he impa- tiently awaited the summons to dinner, when he hoped again to see his Blanche. -The remainder of the week was spent in making preparations for the approaching wed- ding, and the long journey. Dresses were made, wardrobes were searched, and trunks were packed, much to the bewilderment of Greta, in whose ignorance of what was to happen Lisbeth found much consolation. "What does all this packing and pre- paring mean?" inquired Greta of her hus- band, early Monday morning, before they had arisen. "Why should I know?" replied Klas, with a    170  . THE LAST OF  IS NAMXE, yawn, and stretching his arms so widely that Greta's little nose was in danger. "But you should know, though," said Greta. "Now I think that Miss Blanche and the Steward are to be married."  "Pshawl" replied Klas, turning upon his side; "more likely Mrs. Lisbeth is going to run away with Mr. Denys." "Ah, but you don't know all that I do, The other day when I gave master's letter to Miss Blanche the Steward was in the room, and from the manner in-which he devoured her with his eyes-just as you used to look at me, Klas--- I was sure that something was to hap. pen."

"There, I told you, so," cried- she, :'Mrs. Lisbeth, a moment ago, requested your and my appearance in the parlor this, morning; and for what, do you think? why nothing more nor less than to be witnesses of a' marriage between Mr. Steward Edmund Denys and Miss Blanche de Garcia!"

At ten o'clock the parson will arrive, so make haste and prepare yourself." At half-past nine o'clock, Blanche, attired in a white bridal dressy descended to the parlor accompanied by Mrs. Lisbeth. In the parlor they found-Edmund awaiting their arrival. He greeted his beautiful bride with a kiss, and bestowed upon Lisbeth a friendly smile. The conversation was brief and uninteresting; the importance of the day weighed heavily upon both Edmund and Blanche; and Lisbeth felt a pang of sorrow as she gazed upon the familiar ob-   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    173 jects of the room, that soon she was to part with for ever. The clock struck ten, and the parson, who had been duly notified by Mr. de Garcia, knocked at the hall door. He was admitted, and, accompanied by Greta and Klas, he pro' ceeded to the parlor. Here he found the bride and bridegroom; no maids nor grooms attended them as they stood before the holy man, and responded to his questions. They were married. After refreshing himself with a glass of wine and a piece of cake, and wishing the youthful couple all the happiness that earth could bestow, the good parson took his leave, his mind per- plexed by the singular procedure of the cere- mony he had just performed. He had officiated at the wedding of Klas and Greta, and sighed as he remembered the gaiety and joyousness of the festival on that occasion.   174    THE T AB OF HS NAME. On the afternoon of the following day Blanche and her husband, arm-in-arm, walked through the apartments of the house. Blanche sighed oft and deep, as she thought that this was the last day she should spend beneath her father's roof. They entered the room where she had heard the dying words of her beloved mother. The furniture remained as before Mrs. de Garcia's death. Upon the table reposed a withered flower, and as Blanche recognised it as one she had herelfl gathered for her mother, she could no longer repress her 'tears. She placed the flower in her bosom,; ad with one long look upon the room and its furniture, endeared to her by the memory of her mother, she clasped her husband's hand, and silently they left -the sacred place. At five o'clock, accompanied by Lisbeth and the weeping Greta, and followed by Klas,   TRE lUSt OP HS NAME.    175 who to conceal his tears loitereed behind, they pro- ceeded to the wharf, where, upon the ice, stood a covered sleigh into which their 'tnrun  and boxes had been previously placed. The horses and sleigh had been engaged by Mr. de Garcia the day before. "Have you my mother's package, Edmund?" inquired Blanche, who in the excitement of the past week had forgotten it. "I placed it, with the seals unbroken, in your trunk. We will open it upon our arrival at Stockholm." The driver cracked his whip, the horses sprang forward, and followed by a torrent of farewells from Greta and Klas Hans, the sleigh quickly glided over the smooth surface of the bay.'- The following Friday de Garcia returned to   176    THE LAST OF HS NAME. Blomnmaholme, and received a circumstantial account of the wedding from Greta, which he listened to with evident satisfaction; but to him the house appeared gloomy and deserted. Eve had departed from paradise.   CHAPTER XIII. OTTO. HOW pleasant it is to step over the threshold of a house which has been erected by patient toil and honest industry. Where diligence and activity have raised their thrones, there we ind quiet happiness. How much sweeter is the bread eaten after a day of wholesome labor, than the most delicious condimentafter a tedious day Of idleness and ennui. Twenty years had elapsed after the wedding of Klas Hans and Greta, and they now resided in a neat cottage in the garden at Blomnmna, holme near the gate of the hedge. One year   178    THE LAST OF HS NAME. after their union they were blessed with an in- fant--a beautiful boy; but although beautiful his lungs were powerful, and his voice was shrill. Mr. de Garcia, after the departure of his daugh- ter and her husband, had grown peevish, and the notes of the new-comer troubled him so much, that of his own accord he presented Klas with a small plot of ground in the garden, and bade him to erect a cottage, wherein he might house his wife and her squalling brat. Now the term, "squalling brat," vexed honest Klas to his heart; but as it was so well buttered with the gift of the ground, he swallowed the epithet, and manfully set himself to work at erecting his cot- tage. This was in due time accomplished, and now it stood, white as snow, glistening in the midst of a cabbage garden. Over the door a hop vine had been trained to twine itself the   TIE LAST op ,xS NAr E.   179 green leaves of which formed a stong and no unpleasant contrast with the whiteness of the cottage. He should peep through the cot- tage door, we would see the good Greta herself, busily engaged with her spinning-wheel, or per- haps with the knitting work; and should we visit the cottage during the latter part of a pleasant afternoon, we would find Mr. de Garcia, seated by the door, lookin   out  upon the bay, and con versing with Greta of his absent daughter and her husband. Time and sorrow had made sad changes upon the once elegan de Garcia.  heeks were hollow, his eye sunken and dime s  ai nearly white. His lips had not smiled since his daughters departure, and yet his eyes had not wept. Alone he dwelt in the once cheerful mansion and although he permitted Greta to attend to his few domesticants, he   180    THl LAST OF HS NAME. would not allow her to remain in the house longer than was sufficient for her to accomplish her duties there. His greatest pleasure was de? rived from the education of Otto, Greta's only son. Otto Kuller was now in his nineteenth summer. A tall, handsome boy, with red-brown cheeks, thick curling black hair, and sparkling eyes, he was the pride of his parents and the idol of de Garcia. His father still pursued his ancient avocation; and with the yacht, the wedding gift from de  Garcia, he sent his fish to the village along the coast, even occa- sionally visiting Stockholm. He was gene-. rally accompanied by Otto, and wherever they went, the young lad was a universal favorite. At the fish market of R--, in which village Klas was well known; the purchasers would pass other fish stalls th thathey might have an   THE LAST OF HS 1NAME,    1 opportunity of conversing with the sprightly boy. Under the careful teachings of de Garcia Otto made rapid progress, and encouraged by the kind old man he became passionately fond of reading. With books he was well supplied, for de Garcia's library contained the writings of the best authors, to all of which Otto had access. The only occupied rooms in the mansion at Blomrnaholme were' Mr. de Garcia's dresring. room, the kitchen, and the library. The doors of every other apartment he had carefully locked that their furniture might remain as it had been left by his daughter. Frequently the old man would relate to Otto, of his lovely daughter and her husband, and the boy would listen weeping with sympathy when the narrator's voice trembled with emotion, and then he would wonder why   182    THE LAST OF HS NAMbE.  he wept, During  the entire absence of his daughter, de Garcia had heard nothing of her condition. True, each   mail from America brought him letters, the superscription written in his daughter's familiar handwriting, thus assur- ing him that she was still alive; but with strange perversion the old man never broke their seals, although he carefully preserved each letter. It was with de Garcia's approval -that Otto aecompanied his father on his fishing excursions; and frequently when the weather was pleasant the old man would go himself, and assist in dragging the net with as much energy and sill as though he had been a fisherman all his days. During the absence of her husband and son, Greta was always busy. It was wonderfult but nevertheless true, that Greta invariably had a little gift or surprise for Klas and her son Otto   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    183. upon their return. A worsted tippet ;. an em- broidered scarf; a tit-bit for dinner; a neatly hemmed handkerchief, and even a linen night- cap-whatever it might be, either the father or son received something. Now, dame Greta, if she was at all vain, was proud of her nightcaps. She fancied that she could make the neatest and best fitting nightcap that ever was worn, and so much pleasure did she take in their manufac- ture, that both Klas and his son, and even Mr. de Garcia, possessed a more than abundant sup- ply. And they were indeed beautiful and ex- cellent nightcaps, all bound with red, and orna- mented with little red worsted tassels that dan- gled from their long and drooping crowns. Some ' were white and some were blue, and as they possessed so many, Klas concluded that the blue ones should be worn during ;the day time, reserv   184    THE LAST OF HS- NAME. ing the white ones for the night. Even the little yacht could bear evidence to Greta's industry. As Klas was frequently obliged to make long voyages, she had provided the yacht with a small cabin, which contained two berths, a table, two chairs, and a stove. The berths were furnished with crimson curtains; the table was spread with a white table-cloth, and the necessary culinary utensils were as bright and clean as rubbing and scouring could make them. But to the berths Greta had devoted particular attention. She had provided them with soft mattresses and warm blankets, and upon each little pillow was conspi. cuously displayed a white nightcap. The first thought of a wife and mother is to provide for the comfort and happiness of her husband and child- ren. Kind-hearted Greta,the objectsiof yourloving attentions were worthy of your fervent affection.   C  APTER XIV. RED CREEK FARM. Now pass we over the broad ocean to the western continent; to the great American Re. public. Here in one of the northern States, upon the banks of a creek which swept between bush and rock, and meandered through noble meadows and orchards, stood a small red cot- tage beneath the shadow of a grove of lofty maples. The doors, window-sashes, blinds, and casements were painted white, in strong contrast with the prevailing hue of the house itself. Such was Red Creek cottage. A  trained grape- vine twined its tendrils gracefully over the lat-   186    THE LAST OF HS NAME, ticed porch of the house, forming a pleasant green canopy in summer, and a rattling grey skeleton in winter. But at the time of which we write it was clothed in verdure, and was thickly hung with small clusters of emerald drops, promising a luscious crop of purple fruit. At the side of the mansion, separated from a green grass-plot in front of the house by a neat white fence, was the garden stored with nature's gifts, useful and ornamental. Great cabbages flourished side, by side with flaunting crimson poppies, and beets were loving companions with roses. Currant bushes hung with ruby clusters of fruit lined the, fences of the garden, and a sweethrier bush scattered its pink blossoms in showers upon the strawherry patch at its feet. Tall hollyhocks bowed gracefully to the salutes. of a gaudy sun-   THE LAST( OF BIS NSIE.    187 flower, which, elevated above all its companions, seemed to ape- the manners of royalty. It worshipped only the sun, turning its broad face to that luminary in the morning, and follong it until it sank behind the western hills. Then the tall flower would droop its head as if in sorrow for the6 departure of its idol. In the centre of the garden stood an elegant summer- house, shaded by the leaves of an enormous grape-vine, which like a huge serpent enfolded it in its embrace. In the summer-house was a clear and lucid spring, around the mossy verge of which seats were erected, and in this spring lived a speckled trout, in happy ease and security. - Beneath the grape-vine that overshadowed the cottage door, a gentleman was seated. His countenance was illumined with a bright stile.   88    -THE LAST OF HS NAME. of contentment, as the warm breeze of the sum- mer evening gently toyed with his jet black locks. Occasionally he glanced towards the gate of the garden- which opened into the main road that conducted to a village, the glistening spires and steeples of which were plainly visi- ble from the cottage door. Then   partially arising from his chair he would gaze steadfastly down the road towards the village, to a small bridge which- crossed the creek, and a fretful exclamation of impatience; for a moment, chased the smile from off his lips. He appeared to be anxiously awaiting the arrival of an expected friend. This genitleman, as our readers may have already shrewdly surmised, is Edmund Denys, no longer Steward of Blornmaholme, but pro- prietor of Red Creek Farm, a large and well * e         * '   l      M1  THE LAST OF HS NAME.  189 cultivated estate in one of the most fertile por- tions of the United States. After he, with his wife and Lisbeth, had arrived at Stockholm, they immediately   engaged passage for America. Upon their arrival he sought and found the residence of his sister Mary, and by the assist- ance of the  legacy- left to Blanche. by her mother, he had purchased Red Creek Farm, where he now resided. Heaven had blessed his marriage with a daughter, who, as she advanced to the years of girlhood, increased in beauty, until Edmund fancied that she was almost as fair as her mother. Ida was now in her seven- teenth year. Although young, she had attained the stature of maidenhood, and in her move. ments she betrayed none of the awkwardness that usually characterizes girlsi when budding into womanhood.  Her hair was black and J    190    THE LAST OF HS NAME. abundant   Her complexion dark, the skin seeming transparent, and beneath it could be seen the roses apparently struggling for pre- eminence. Her eyes were black, and in their deep wells a thoughtful almost mournful ex- pression reposed; but when she was animated they sparkled and flashed with dianmond-like brilliancy. Loving -and gentle in her nature Ida Denys was the idol of her parents and the loved companion of her mates. But most particularly was she the favorite of Mrs. Lisbeth, who from her birth had nursed and attended her. Time had gently dealt with our old friend Lisbeth. He had interwoven silver threads with her dark hair, and had traced lines and pleasant wrinkles in her face once- smooth. But neither grey hairs nor furrows had removed the good. natured smile from her lips; they seemed to   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     191 bestow upon her amiable features an air of vene. rable complacency. Upon her first arrival at Red Creek Farm, Lisbeth formed a-friendship for a worthy individual. This personage had long been a family servant in the house of Ed. mund's father, and after the misfortune of his master, had not deserted the daughter; on the contrary, although Mary had informed him of the altered circumstances of her family, he had followed her to her place of refuge, and, had attended upon her as formerly, and when Ed- mund arrived with his young and beautiful wife, to the great joy of the faithful man, he was once more received as a  servant as in times of old. His services were invaluable to his master, for in the management of a farm  he was an adept, having served a long apprenticeship previous to entering the service of Edmund's father. This   192    THE LAST OF HS NAME. worthy gentleman rejoiced in the name of Ro- mulus, and in a face black and shining. In his younger days he had been the property of a south- ern gentleman, who, induced by long friend- ship for the elder Denys, presented Romulus to him. Although Mr. Denys had never consi- dered Romulus as his slave, still the faithful ser- vant always respected him as his master, and Edmund he loved with an intense devotion. When Mrs. Lisbeth first saw Romulus, she cast up her hands, and widened her eyes in astonish- ment. It was the first time that she had beheld a man of sable hue, and thei appearance of honest Romulus awakened a thrill of fear within her innocent heart. It happened that Mrs. Lisbeth had entered the kitchen for the purpose, of su- perintending the operations of the workmen, who were fitting up that apartment with the   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     19 various necessary requisites, when Romulus, who had that day arrived at the farm, suddenly en- tered the room. With a shriek of horror Lis- beth flew to the parlor. "O Miss Blanche!" Lisbeth had never been able to call her mistress by any other title. "There is an evil spirit in the kitchen!" "A what?" inquired Blanche, smiling. "I believe it is the ---,you know what I mean." "It is only Romulus, my dear," said Ed- mund, entering the room. "Mary has arrived, and brought the faithful fellow with her." "Your sister arrived and not yet visited me?" said Blanche, reproachfully. "She came but a moment ago--ah! here she is." Mary Denys entered the room. She was Mary Denys entered the room. She was ,  '  ' ,   194    THE LAST OF HS BAME. younger than her brother; but sorrow had given to her pale countenance a tinge of mournfulness, which caused her to appear older than she was in reality. She was clad in deep mourning, and her manner to a stranger appeared coldly digni- fled and uncordial; but- when her eyes fell upon Blanche a bright smile for a moment played upon her thin lips. Blanche felt a thrill of sym- pathy for her husband's sister. As with one accord they cordially embraced each other, and Blanche, resting her head upon her new-found sister's bosom, wept tears of joy. Blanche had, under Edmund's former teaching, made such progress in his language that she was able to converse fluently with Mary. This was a cause of much unhappiness to poor Mrs. Lisbeth, who, in spite of all her study, was unable to compre- hend a syllable. Perceiving herself entirely *   THE LAST or H8 JSME.     195 neglected, Lisbeth returned to the ktchen, curi- ous again to behold the face of Romulus. There he stood polishing the stove with a brush which vied in blackness with his own face. Romulus was at that time about fifty-five years of age. His eyes were deeply set, and sparkled from their dark cavities like two diamonds. His nose presented none of the peculiarities of his race; it was aquiline, and overshadowed a mouth always smiling, and garnished with teeth the pearly whiteness of which formed a pleasing contrast with the blackness of his skin. tHis hair was white and thick, curling to an immense pyramid upon the summit of his head.   This arrangement of his hair Romulus considered one of his greatest beauties, and each morning he devoted an hour solely in dressing:and building it. up. * ' ,  #    196    THE LAST OF HS NAME. "Now ole woman, what is you looking at?"' exclaimed Romulus, vexed at Lisbeth's continued stare; and if Lisbeth could have understood him she undoubtedly would also have been angry, for the epithet old woman was one that she parti- cularly detested. "What a man! what languagesl" exclaimed she unconsciously. "Oh, she's Dutchl" muttered Romulus, gravely turning to his work, which he now en- livened by a shrill whistle the sound of which penetrated into Lisbeth's very brain. This was Lisbeth's first introduction to Romulus; but after a month had elapsed and she had become familiarized with his appearance, they became better acquainted with each other, and every evening, after the close of a day of toil in the fields, Romulus would sit in the kitchen smoking   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     197 his pipe, and endeavoring to make Lisbeth com- prehend him, as with much gesticulation he de- scribed the incidents of his life. Lisbeth, with her knitting work in hand, would listen as pa- tiently and complacently as though she under- stood every word. By constant practice, and iapplication to books loaned her by her mistress, she at length acquired a sufficient knowledge of the language to understand it, and to speak it in ordinary conversation; but by her constant intercourse with Romulus she had unconsciously acquired the peculiarities of his dialect. Romu- lus was delighted when Lisbeth was finally able 'to converse with him, and he listened to her de- scription of the beauties of her native land with much satisfaction. In return he narrated the incidents of his younger days, when he was a slave in the southern states; and when Lisbeth   198    TBE LAST OF HS,NAME. ventured to vent her indignation upon the bar- barity of the slave-holder, Romulus would pucker up his lips, and emit a long whistle, and then open such a torrent of argument in justification of slavery that in astonishment Lisbeth would hold her peace. As time wore on Lisbeth found greater comfort in the society of Romulus, and often as she gazed upon his placid countenance enveloped in wreaths of tobacco smoke, the old lady would sigh as she sorrowfully took a pinch of snuff, ' Oh, if he was not black "   CHAPTER XV. MRS. BLACK AND MRS. BROWN. "MR. BLACK; called here this morning," said Edmund one day to his wife, "and what think you, Blanche, was his businesss?" "Mr. Black? who is Mr. Black, Edmund?" "An old friend, my dear, one of the richest merchants of New York. He will take dinner with us to-day, and has brought an invitation from his wife requesting us to spend a fortnight with them in the city, and to take Ida with us. What think you, had we better go?" "If you are inclined to do  So," replied Blanche, "I should be pleased to accept Mrs.   200    THE LAST OF HS NAME, Black's invitation. Has she  not invited Mary!" "Yes, Mary is invited; but I am certain that she will not go, you know her disposition; she prefers to remain here, the solitude of country life affords her more pleasure now than the fri- volities of the city, although I well remember when she was the gayest among the gay. Ah!" continued he with a sigh, " poor Mary is changed, much changed." "Do you think, Edmund," inquired Blanche, "that we should take Ida with us?" "Why not? replied Edmund, " she is now seventeen years old, and should see something of life. It grieves me when I see her so mournful. It appears unnatural that a child so young should thus be constantly melancholy." "She is not always so," said Mrs. Denys. "I   THE LAST OF. HS NAME.    201 have seen her the liveliestI and most merry amongher companions. "Then it is" better that she should accompany us," replied Edmund, "for here at this season of the year, she has but few companions; and I am fearful if She continues in her present mood, she will become a second edition of her aunt Mary." It'was decided that Ida' should go, and:' the next morning, acc0mpaniecd by Mr." Black, the little party set forth for the great metropolis. Ida's heart beat with 'the brightest' anticipations of the happiness she should experience- in the- city. Throughout the- entire night her little --head had been filled' with a thousand fancies,; conjectures, and plots, and to fearful was shethiat she wouid:'oversleep-' It-elf infti-the morhing, anrd not be called'in time td go with the; others,that she had endeavored to remaiti awake alif nigt; 10   202    THE LAST OF HS NAME. but 'in this she failed, for in the midst of her cogitations she suddenly fell asleep, and did not awake until Lisbeth entered her room in the morning.. Without accident or incident they safely arrived in the city, and were received by Mrs. Black most cordially. Mr. Black resided in an elegant stone mansion in one of the fashionable avenues of the city.  Directly opposite his house was another built upon the same plan, in fact precise counterpart of it. The next morn- ig after their arrival, Ida and Mrs. Black, who had taken the young girl under her particular . protection, were standing together near the win- dow. Upon- the doorsteps of the opposite house stood a young gentleman, foppishy at- tired. Bis coat was of faultless fit, his hat per- feotl: balanced upon his perfumed head, and his   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     203 pantaloons gracefully overhiing  his elegant boots, which rere polished to brilliancy.- "Who resides in that house 7 " inquired Ida, innocently.  Mrs. Black's lips assumed a sneer, as she replied, "the Browns; that's young Brown on- the steps there..  Deterred by the tone of Mrs. Black's voice, Ida: questioned- no further. As we shall here- after have occasion to *efer to  Mr. Brown and, his family, we will here state that in former days Mrs. Black and Mrs. Brown were on the most intimate terms of: friendship. Whatever, Mrs, Black said Mrs. Brown: quoted, and what- ever Mrs. Brown possessed, Mrs. Black praised. But as they increased  in wealth, that foul demon, Envy, stepped between them and es- tranged, their hearts. Now, whatever  Mrs.   204    THE LAST OF HTS NAME. Black said, Mrs. Brown contradicted, and what- ever Mrs. Black possessed, Mrs. Brown envied, and determined to outvie. From loving com- panions they became inveterate enemies, al- though, whenever they chanced to meet, one would have supposed, from the tone of endear- ment they used towards each other, that they were most loving friends., Ida left the window and approached Mr. Black, who, sitting with his feet upon the fender near the grate, was reading the morning paper. Her father and mherer had that morning gone to visit a friend and Ida remained, by Mrs. Black's request, as that lady wished her to accompany her upon a shopping tour. "Oh, Mr. Black, see, look there," ejaculated Mrs. Black, suddenly. With a deep sigh Mr. Bloak approached the window. On the opposite   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     205 side of the street, drawn up in front of Mr. Brown's stately mansion, stood an elegant car- riage attached to two noble black horses. Now Mr. Brown and Mr. Black had been    boys together, and from their childhood had been friends. On the very day that Mr. Brown, then a merchant's clerk, led the charming Julia Pinckney, who, by the by, was a grocer's daughter, to the altar, Mr. Black was united to the aristocratic  Catharine Heidenscamp, who, although dowerless, boasted that she had d - scended from one of the highest families in the country. Her grandfather had held high offices under the state, and her great-great-grandfather had been talked of as a candidate for the govern- orship of his native state, and above all her great- greatgreat-greatest-grandfather was among those who first planted their feet upon American soil.   206    TsU LAST OF HS NAME. Despite all these advantages, she condescended to marry Mr. Black, although he was a simple clerk, for she had reached that uncertain age when it is dangerous longer to delay. Mrs. Black and Mrs. Brown were totally unlike, The first was a tall commanding woman, bearing herself erect, and bowing condescend- ingly to her acquaintances; while the latter was a short dumpy woman, with rosy cheeks, laughing eyes, and juicy lips, ever ready with her forward hand, and recognised everybody, whether the salute was returned or not. Mr. Black and Mr. Brown resembled each 'other, and endeavoreditto add to the resemblance by dressing alike. Each wore blue dress coats with gilt buttons, buff waistcoats, black pan- taloons, and white hats. They were sturdy men with very red faces, and hair somewhat grizzled,   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    207 and when away from. home were as arrogant and independent as wealthy men should be. Mr. and Mrs. Black were childless; but Mrs. Brown -had presented her husband with a pro- mising boy, who grew up to dandyhood, and supported the dignity of his family in a manner which greatly irritated her envious neighbor. Mr. Black, followed by Ida; approached the windoir. "It is wonderful, Mr. Black," said his wife, " that you will associate with such a boor as that Brown. See how the man apes the aris- tocrat in his coach and horses. Why even the pannel of the coach and mountings of the har- ness have ' B crowned with a boar's head upon them. He should have put a, calf's head there. It would have been more appropriate. How disgusting it is to see such -people acting as if they were people of family."   208    THE LAST OF HS NAME. l "And so they are, my dear," interposed Mr. Black, meekly; " there's Frederick, besides Mrs. Brown is--" "Mr. Black, you're a fool!" exclaimed Mrs. Black, warning her husband by a peculiar glance towards the innocent Ida. Mr. Black bowed silently. "I mean," continued his wife with an air of compassion, "I intended to say, Mr. Black, that she was aping the manners of those who, like myself, have reason to boast of their forefathers. Those who can look back with pride upon their noble ancestors and say, from them have I descended; their blood flows in my veins! Now, as for lrs. Brown--but see, there she comes!

There, she has discovered: us, and is bowing." Mrs. Black returned Mrs. Brown's salute with a bow at once graceful and polite, which quite astonished Ida, and caused a peculiar smile to pass over Mr. Black's lips.; That was an eventful day to Mrs. Brown. She arose early, and after breakfast 'she retired to her chamber, where she devoted a longer time than usual at her mirror, for that morning the new coach and horses which Mr. Brown   at her urgent solicitation had purchased the day before, were to be displayed for the first time. -The early part of the morning .Mr. Brown had spent in the stables exam ning his purchases. He was satisfied with horses, harness, and coach; espe. cially was he delighted with the crest, which an ingenious designer had raked  up from the 10*   210    THE LAST OF HS NAME. bowels of "Burke's General Armoury," as be- longing to a family of Browns, who in olden times were the Lords of Brown's Park, --- shire, England. This was sufficient, and Mr. Brown looked with no little pride upon his family arms. His wife could not sufficiently admire them, and she secretly determined to search through that same book, in the hope that she might find her family name there. Her search undoubtedly would prove successful. Blessed be BurkeI he has given "blood" to more would-be aristocrats than there are names in his ponderous record. : After the horses were harnessed Mr. Brown joined his wife at the parlor window, to watch the coachman drive to the door. Oh, how elated he was when he saw Mrs. Black at the opposite windowl He drew the curtains close together,   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    2" and told his wife to peep through and witness her rival's discomfitures. Cruel Brown, thus to triumph over the wife of your friend Black! Mr. Brown was anxious to accompany his wife; but she would not permit it. "It is fashionable nowadays," said she, "for ladies to ride alone." Mr. Brown was obliged to be contented, and continued at his post near the window, that he might observe his wife as she rode in her own carriage. Away went the horses, and 'Mr. Brown, in his endeavors to look after the rapid coach, incautiously thrust his head out of the window.  "Good mrorning, Mr. Jones," shouted a hearty voice from the opposite side of the street. Mr. Brown hastily turned his head towards the spot from whence the voice proceeded, and beheld his friend Black, who was buttoning his   *212    THE LAST OF HS NAME. coat preparatory to his trip down town. Im- mediately the recollection of ancient friendship flashed through Mr. Brown's mind: he returned the cordial salute, and withdrawing his head, hastened to join his friend. "'My dear Black," said he, cordially grasping the extended hand, "I am glad to see you." He was ashamed at heart, for the secret triumph he had indulged in at the expense of the wife of his old friend. "Why, Brown, what is the matter with you? Are you ill?" 'It won't do, Mr. Black, it won't do," re- plied Brown. "I must stop, and to do so must ask your co-operation. I have been too extra- vagant." "Extravagant!. What is the cause, now?" "Your wife."   THE LAST. OF HS NAME.    213 "My wife! Now, Brown, I am aware that you do not admire her, so hold your peace." "But I must speak. Your wife called upon Mrs, Jenkins, a very dear friend of my Julia, and told her that we were a very low family, not entitled to the consideration of any who thought anything of themselves, and she ex. pressed her surprise that a lady of Mrs. Jenkins's discrimination and judgment should hold any intercourse with us. Of course my little wife was highly indignant when Mrs. Jenkins told her this, which she did the very afternoon that Mrs. Black Sad called upon her, having walked 'a mile through the mud and rain to do so, which my wife considered very kind and con- siderate. Well, the upshot of the matter was that Julia spent the whole night in tears and repinings. The next day I happened to visit a   214    THE LAST OF HS NAME. bookstore and there stumbled upon a great book, called  'Burke's General Armoury,' which contains the names of every family of rank in England. I naturally looked for my own name, and found it, with a description of the family arms. I told Julia of my discovery, and nothing would do until I promised to pur- chase horses and carriage, with silver mount. ings, the Brown coat of arms, and so forth and so forth, which I did. Now the carriage is bought, and I have had to pay no small sum for it." "Come along with me, Brown, we will see what can be done.  Where is that boy of yours"? "At home, I suppose; but why do you ask?" "I have a project; a good one I think."   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     215 What this project was Mr. Black did not express; but, from the manner in which he compressed his lips arid wrinkled his brows, it might be considered one of the utmost import- ance. k    CHAPTER XVI. THE, WOMAN OF FASHON. "Now, Miss Ida," said Mrs. Black, after her husband had takenihis departure, " we will dress, and then call upon my friend Mrs. Jenkins, who is to accompany us." While Ida and Mrs. Black were at their toilet, the door-bell sounded violently and the servant admitted Mrs. Jenkins. Mrs. Jenkins was the wife of a somewhat noted literary man, and was consequently admitted into the "best society." She possessed none of her husband's talents; but was a weak woman, believing every- thing that was told her, and having but one good O             .   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    217 quality, which was a kind and forgiving disposi- tion. She never was ill-tempered, even when the most violent abuse was heaped upon her. She would receive it not in anger, but in sor- row, weeping at the thought that she should be ill-treated. But she was an inveterate gossip, and so credulous, that, believing the most ridi- culous and improbable rumors, she would cir- culate them, and consequently was frequently placed in very awkward positions. Mrs. Black endured her company because she was useful; and Mrs. Brown respected her, because she could condole with her, and aside from that because she was the wife of a noted literary character. Ida and Mrs. Black entered the parlor attired for their morning walk. The young lady was introduced to Mrs. Jenkins, who seemed over- joyed at the honor conferred upon her. To-   218    THE LAST OF HS NAME. gether the. three ladies left the house' and pro- :'ceeded towards a street renowned for the ele- gance of its stores and bazars. At length, as Mrs. Black had joyfully anticipated, she disco. vered Mrs. Brown's carriage standing before the entrance of one of the magnificent buildings, and upon entering the sales-room she saw Mrs. Brown seated upon a sofa, complacently convers- ing with a score of her friends who were con- gratulating her upon her elegant establishment. "Good morning, my dear Mrs. Brown," ex- claimed Mrs. Black, bustling through the throng of chattering ladies, and shaking her neighbor's hand violently. "What a beautiful carriage you havel the horses are magnificent! The entire establishment is superb i" and then the surrounding ladies, after they had greeted Mrs. Black and Mrs. Jenkins, joined in praises of the   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     219 new carriage. Mrs. Jenkins was in her element; talking louder and faster than all the rest. So happy was she, that tears of joy started to her eyes, as she found her opinion fully coincided with. Mrs. Black, however, observed her with malicious eyes, fully concurring in all she said, but taking occasion to whisper to Mrs. Brown, sufficiently loud that'Mrs. Jenkins might hear:. "What a silly woman Mrs. Jenkins is!"   The unfortunate lady heard the remark, and with an' effort swallowed  down  her sorrow; but, she spoke no more that morning. All of this Ida heard and saw with wonder. She had heard Mrs. Black's words to her hus- band that morning, and could not reconcile them with her  present conduct. Although  Mrs. Black was loud in her praises of the carriage and horses, yet she was careful to express her   220    THE LAST OF HS NAME. opinion concerning the coat of arms; and then, satisfied with her exertions,' she took her depar- ture followed by Ida, who saw with surprise that she bade all the ladies a friendly " good morn- ing," except Mrs. Jenkins, whom she passed by with a vacant stare. The latter lady, humbled and mortified, lost no time in departing, for now that she had been slighted by Mrs. Black, the other ladies looked coldly upon her. Mrs. Black saw her approach, and wishing to avoid her, turned with her young companion into a narrow street. They had not proceeded far, when Mrs. Black's attention was arrested by a sign placed over the door-way of a low and dingy building, bearing the words, "Heidenscamp; Soap and candle maker." Before the door stood a little red-headed man, industriously puffing at a short pipe. Mrs. Black would have turned back; but   THE LAST OF HS NAME..-    221, she was stayed by the little man, who, as soon as he discovered her, cast his pipe' to the ground,' and rushing towards her exclaim-ed: "What do I see? As I live it is my little niece KEate!" and without: more ado he seized the aristocratic Mrs. Black by the hand. Thus entrapped, Mrs. Black was obliged to introduce him to Ida, as her uncle John; and hoping that none of; her lafdy friends would see her, she returned the warm pressure of his hand, much moved, in spite of her pride, athis cordial greeting. But to her horror she saw Mrs. Brown's coach approaching, and averted her eyes until the vehicle. had passed. Mrs. Black X hastily bade her kinsman adieu, and they rapidly wended their: way homewards. Neither Ida nor her companion spoke, Ida was lost in wroner at the insight she had thus unexpecedly received i   222    THE LAST OF HS NAME. into the mysteries of fashionable life. Mrs. Blalck's pride had received a severe blow, and the shock had left its impression. When Mrs. Brown sought her carriage, to her surprise and vexation she found; it missing. The coachran had probably driven the horses a short distance to exercise them, she thought, and would soon return; but Mrs. Brown waited in vain, the carriage did- not, arrive. At length losing all patience, she walked towards her home, endeavoring to console herself by striving to invent a suitable punishment for the delinquent driver.  "Well," said Mr. Black to:his friend, as they were walking together, ".the only bone of con- tention that I now see is the carriage. Over that.   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     223 our wives will quarrel until I shall be obliged to purchase one in self-defence." "I have an idea," said Mr. Brown, interrupt- ing his friend; ': I will dispose of my carriage immediately, and then you must devise some plan whereby our wives may become. recon' ciled." '  "I have already a plot in my head,- which I think a good one, but will wait until after the carriage is out of the way before I attempt it." During their walk the gentlemen passed the, store, in front of which the carriage was stand- ing. "Now for it," exclaimed Mr,-Brown,- dragging his friend; into the vehicle.: "To-- street, driver."  While on their way to a sales'stable,: .the car- riage passed through the very street where Mrs. Black encounteredi her uncle. Mr. Brown saw   224    THE LAST OF HS NAME. Mrs. Black, but said nothing to his friend, who was looking out of the other window. The car- riage and horses were deposited with a dealer who was authorized to advertise them for sale, and the two gentlemen returned to their respec- tive homes. For the first time since their marriage, Mr. Black was met at the door by his wife. Her eyes wee rered and Swollen with weeping. With- out waiting her question, she conducted him to a sofa, and told himn under what circumstances she had: met her uncle, how she regretted her past folly- iri- one word that -her pride had fallen, and-she was determined that it should never rise again. This was excellent news forMr. Black, as it favored the little scheme he had already coneocted. "My dear -Kate," said he pressing a kiss   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    226 upon her Mps, "I am rejoiced to hear you speak thus; but now forget all the past and listen to something more pleasing. My friend, Mr. Denys, and his wife and daughter are here, and it would be but courtesy to make a little party for them." "I have been thinking of that myself," re- plied Mrs. Black; " but who shall we invite?" ' "Oh, prepare a list of names yourself; don't forget, however, to insert the names of Mr. and Mrs. Brown; perhaps," he continued, with a smile, "perhaps Mrs. Brown could assist you in making out the list." "A good suggestion," said Mrs. Black, blush- ing deeply. "I will at once call upon her." When Mr. Brown entered his house he found his wife in tears, and when he told her that the "   226    THE LAST OF HS NAME. carriage and horses were to be sold* her rage knew no bounds. "You are a brute, Mr. Brown, that you are, to sell the carriage the very day it first arrived! What will Mrs. Black think? I shall never dare look her in the face again." And then the infuriated lady burst into an agony of tears, bemoaning her sad fate, until poor Mr. Brownm heart relented, and he was upon the point of assuring her that the carriage should not be sold, when -he was interrupted by a sharp ring- ing of the hall bell. The servant answered the summons, and to the bewilderment of Mrs. Brown, and the joy of the perplexed husband, Mrs. Black entered the parlor. Mrs. Brown dried her tears quickly, and received her visitor with the utmost cordiality. Mrs. Black observed the swollen eyes of her   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     227 friend; but she knew not the cause.  The two ladies seated themselves upon the sofa, and Mr. Brown, satisfied that all would turn out well, with a slight bow to Mrs. Black, left the apart- ment. Soon the ladies were engaged in deep consultation. Mrs. Black drew out the -list of names of those. whom she wished to invite to 6her soirde, and requested Mrs. Brown to look them over, and to insert such as she thought proper. Again  smiles appeared upon Mrs. Brown's lips; she laughed, chatted, and made her little alterations in the list of invitations with so much apparent pleasure that Mrs. Black's heart was expanded with a joy which she had never before experienced. It is almost needless to state that among the first of the? names stood Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins, and J. Hei- denscamp, Esq., wife, and daughter. It was   228    THE LAST OF HS NAME. agreed between the ladies that the party should take place on the evening of the following Mon- day, and Mrs. Brown's joy was rendered com- plete, when Mrs. Black entreated her to request her son Frederick to invite some of his young friends to be present on that occasion. During Mr. and Mrs. Denys's homeward walk from their visit, they passed through one of the business streets of the city. They walked slowly that they might observe the constant variety of novel objects that met their gaze on every side. In each window wares of the richest description were displayed. It one blazed diamonds, glit- tering jewelry, and massive silver plate, and in another were suspended costly laces and bro- cades. Side by side with ladies clothed in magnifi- cent silks and satins, walked beggars guised in   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    229 rags, and dandies in broadcloth. Poverty and wealthy misery and splendor, here walked, as it were, hand in hand. Suddenly Blanche uttered an exclamation of surprise, and pointed towards a door-step upon which was seated a lad, clothed in the costume of her native land. By his side, with her head reposing in his lap, a beautiful child was sleep- ing. A smile of contentment illumined her pale face, and her little hand was clasped confidingly in the hand of her youthful protector. Edmund approached the couple. "Do you speak Swedish, sir?" inquired the lad, turning his face anxiously towards the gen- tleman as he stopped before them. "Yes, my lad, can weassist you?" "Oh, sir," replied the boy, his eyes stream- ing with joyful tears. "For many long lonely   280    THE LAST OF HS NAME. hours I have sat here with little Ebba, and have asked that question I know not how many times, but no one heeded us." "Where have I seen that face before?" whispered Blanche to her husband. "Does it not seem familiar to you, Edmund?" At this moment little Ebba awoke, and glancing up into the face of the boy said, in a piteous tone, "Oh, Otto, I am so hungry!" "Hungry, my childl" said Blanche; "dear Edmund, they must go with us. I cannot leave them in their distress." "Come," said Edmund, pressing his wife's hand warmly, "go with us. We will provide for your wants; are you hungry yet, Ebba?" Ebba did not reply, but hid her little face in Otto's' bosom. Blanche took her by the hand, and the child arising, instinctively clung to her / , * ** - .   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    231 garments. Otto arose and wilked by Edmund's side as they proceeded towards Mr. Black's resi. dence. Edmund could not but admire the noble bearing of the youth, and was astonished at his conversational powers. They arrived at their destination, where Edmund and Blanche, with their young proteggs, were cordially'received by Mrs. Black, and an abundant dinner was pro. vided for the hungry guests.   C HAPTER' XVII. THE CATASTROPHE. IT was a bright summer morning when Klas Hans and Otto embarked in their little sloop for Stockholm, with a cargo of fish. Mr. de Garcia and Greta stood upon the wharf, the one waving his hat, and the other her, white hand- kerchief to the departing friends, and they re- mained there until the sloop was but a white speck upon the dark green water. Then they slowly returned to the cottage, where the old man remained the entire day. Towards evening a dark cloud arose from the southern horizon; quickly it spread over   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    233 the skating a deep shadow upon the surface of the water. It brought with it a furious gale, which lashed the waters of the bay to whiteness, and swept over the island, over- turning haystacks, and levelling fences. .As suddenly as it arose, so suddenly it subsided. For an instant the sun shone brightly upon the waters of the bay, then it darted behind a cloud, and a deep fog settled upon the water, which was in turn followed by a heavy fall of rain. During the storm, the thoughts of the good Greta were with her absent husband and son. After reading a chapter in the Bible, as was her usual custom each night, she knelt down and prayed fervently that He, who holds the ocean in the hollow of His hand, should watch over and protect her child-and husband. Strength- "*   234    THE LAST OF HS NAME. ened and assured by faith, Greta retired to her bed and soon slumbered soundly. In the middle of the night she was suddenly aroused from her deep sleep by the sound of loud knocking upon the cottage door. She hastened to open it, and her eyes met an object which filled her soul with horror and fear.- Uplon the threshold stood the form of her husband; his countenance pale, and his eyes wild and staring. From a deep gash upon his forehead slowly oozed a stream of blood, and his left arm hung useless in a bloody sleeve. He staggered into the cottage and sank upon a chair. He had fainted. With tender care Greta placed him upon the bed, and washed the blood from off his forehead. Her heart beat with wild anxiety when she thought of her child. Where was hel?-dead? Alas I Klas could not reply. He was senseless. t   THE LAST OF HS NAME     235 With desperate haste she proceeded to the mansion and called Mr. de Garcia, who imme- diately arose and returned with her to the cot- tage. He was as anxious concerning the fate of Otto as was the half-distracted mother; but he retained his self-possession, and administered proper restoratives to the inanimate Klas. His efforts were soon rewarded by a deep groan from the suffering man, who immediately after- wards slowly turned upon his back, and raising himself on his unhurt arm, gazed tearfully upon the face of his wife. "Otto, our boy, is, dead-is dead "He fell back upon the bed, and his groans and sobs were heart-rending. Greta, wringing her hands and weeping piteously, walked to and fro un- heeding her husband's situation. De Garcia for a moment was stupified by the horrible news; but   236    THE LAST OF HS NAME. observing the critical situation of the wounded man, he recovered himself with an effort, and attempted to assuage the grief of the afflicted mother. "'To-night, Greta," said he, " we must not give way to our tears. Your husband now should claim our attention. We must thank God that both are not taken from us." "Thank God!" exclaimed Greta, in her sor- row forgetting everything else. ' Oh, how sin- cerely I have-prayed to him that my poor boy might be spared-to me, and now-now." She was interrupted by her sobs, and casting herself upon a chair she burst into a renewed flood of tears. "Greta, my wife," whispered Klas, rising in his bed. "May you' be forgiven those words! The Lord gave, and the Lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord. Oh, Greta, he   THE LAST OF HS NAME.      237 doeth all things well. Come to me, I am hurt, perhaps to death." "Pardon me, oh, pardon me, my husband," entreated Greta, kneeling by the side of the bed, "but do tell me of Otto." "To-morrow, Greta, when I am stronger." Thus assured, Greta arose, and soon her tears were dried, as she busied herself in attending to the wants of the sick one. She prepared a soothing draught, and administered it to her husband, who soon    slept quietly. Mr. de Garcia remained near the sick bed, waiting for the morning. He also was anxious to learn the particulars of Otto's death. iHe retired to a small bed-room, while Greta watched by the side of her husband. The rain had ceased pattering upon the roof of the cottage, and the night was dark and still. The silence of the cottage was ei    288    THE LAST OF HS NAME. only broken by the monotonous sound of de Garcia's footfalls as ho walked slowly to and -fro in his room, and the stifled sobs of the sorrow- ing Greta. The next morning Klas was sufficiently) strong to relate the particulars of the accident. After the yacht had left the bay, and entered the main ocean, the voyagers found the water so rough that they deemed it expedient to return. They were about doing so, when a squall struck them. Otto was at the helm, and in the midst of ,the gale, which was accompanied by driving sleet and rain, Klas lost sight of his son.; The brave little vessel stood the shock boldly;- but the force of the wind nearly placed her upon her beam-ends. The squall suddenly passed over, and when the yacht righted, to his father's horror, Otto's place at the helm was vacant. In   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    239 vain did he anxiously gaze over the troubled surface of the sea. Nothing met his vision save a dismasted ship, which was tossing upon the water, a short distance from the yacht. Klas at once went to the helm, his eyes blinded with his tears, and the blood which trickled from a wound he had received in his forehead. He now discovered that his left arm was broken, and overcome with the sudden misfortunes that had fallen upon him, he mechanically turned his vessel homewards. A ray of hope entered de Garcia's heart as Klas concluded. "Perhaps," said he, "Otto may have been saved by the crew of the ship you saw." "Oh, sir," replied Klas, "I cannot hope that; when the squall first struck us the ship was not in sight. Had it been, I would have gone to it at once."   240    THE LAST OF HS NAME. Greta, whose eyes had lightened with hope at Mr. de Garcia's words, again sank back in des- pondency. In vain were de Garcia's efforts to console her; and although in course of time her husband was fully restored to her, and  she neglected none of her former duties nor lost her tender love for him, yet an air of melancholy settled upon her brow, and thereafter clothed her countenance with an expression of sorrow. Poor Klas also lost his former mirthfulness; each day he performed his labors, and returned home in the evening, but his spirit wanted alacrity and cheerfulness. Mr. de Garcia became still more melancholy than before; he wandered about the estate, rarely visiting the cottage, and when he did, he returned from it with eyes swollen and inflamed with weeping. At length he had found the solace of   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     241 tears. The unfortunate yacht remained secured to the little dock, inl useless inactivity. The sun warped its timbers, and the winds and  rains whitened its spars. Ghastly and grim, appeared the once fairy-like craft, as it swung in its moor- ings, the wind whistling mournfully through its cordage, and the remnants of its sails flapping the masts with a doleful sound. It became the resting-place for Wild sea-birds, who screamed in concert with the howling wind., Green mould gathered in the crevices of the deck, and weeds sprang up from the yawning seams in its sides. It was a fitting type of the life in the once beau- tiful Blommaholme. The avenging spirits of the slain sea-rovers of Retribution Isle, it almost ap- peared, were hovering over the island, bringing sorrow and, death to its inhabitants.  '   CHAPTER     XVIII. THE PLANET. THROUGH the bright blue waves of the At- lantic dashed the good ship Planet of Stockholm, bound for New York. The Captain was a jovial man, short and stout; his lips ever wearing a smile for the cabin passengers, and his brow a frown for those who, unfortunately, were com- pelled to choose the steerage. He was a tidy man, the captain was; and the squalid, and sometimes, it must be confessed, filthy steerage passengers marred the beauty of the snow-white deck, and aside from that might affect the nerves of some of his delicate lady cabin passengers.   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     248 Therefore he directed his mate to allow those who occupied the steerage, to appear on deck only early in the morning before 'the other pas- sengers had arisen, or in the evening after they had retired to the cabin. By this arrangement our humane captain flattered himself that he -worked for the interests of both classes. The cabin of the Planet was elegantly fur' nished and carpeted, and: was well provided with comfortable berths. Here, each evening, were congregated the cabin passengers, who wiled away the tedious hours in light conversation, and innocent games of chance. Occasionally they thought of their fellow passengers in the steerage; but those-thoughts were always accom- panied with sentiments of disgust and aversion, and were quickly driven away. In the steerage reigned darkness, filth, and   244    THE LAST OF HS NAME. misery. In the rude wooden berths, groaned the sick and the dying, and on the floor were clusters of children, boys and girls, unheeded and uncared for. Amidst the wailing of infants and the sobs of mothers, could be heard an oc- casional oath from brutal men, rendered still more hardened by their misery. The better class of emigrants had separated from the others, forming a party by themselves. Amongst these was a family consisting of a husband, wife, and child. The appearance of the man bespoke that he once moved in higher circles of life; while the delicate emaciated countenance of his wife still possessed remnants of a former beauty, which at one -time undoubtedly won the admir- ation of all. Her demeanor was-gentle, but sad- so sad that grief seemed to be gnawing at her heart-strings, to sunder the feeble cords that * '    \   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    245 bound her to life. Her child was beautiful; yet pale and thin. Abundant clusters of golden hair fell upon her white shoulders, and her ruby lips: appeareda like twin strawherries reposing upon the bosom of a lily. One day, when the voyage was about half completed, a youthful couple separated them- selves from the crowd, and found refuge near one of the stern windows through which they could glance out upon the flashing water. The one was the fair creature above described; and the other a lad, with whom we shall hereafter become acquainted. "Now, you see, Ebba," said the boy, "when the wind struck the little: sloop, the helm was forced around so quickly that I was thrown into the water. I am a good swimmer, and struck out to save my life; but of what use was it? I   246    THE 'LAST OF HS NAME. saw the yacht fly past me like a shooting star, and I also saw my father clinging to the mast. Poor father, he thinks that I am-dead. My mo- ther too  "He ceased, his sobs choking his utterance. "But how were you saved, Otto?" inquired Ebba, anxiously. ;As I was plunging about in the waves, something struck my head so violently that I was quite stunned. But I reached out my arms and felt something hard, which I caught upon and held} myself up in the water. It was a life- buoy, which the captain of this ship had thrown out to preserve a sailor who had fallen overboard during the same gale. Poor fellow, he was drowned, and through his misfortune I was pre- served. In a few moments a boat came to my relief and I was taken off, weak enough I assure   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    247 you; and the coarse oaths and angry disappoint- ment of the sailors when they found me instead of their shipmate, frightened me so that I fainted, and knew nothing more until I awoke with my head in your mother's lap, and saw you, my good Ebba, weeping in sympathy for my mis- fortune. You sh all be my own little sister for that, and when we once get to America I will work for you, and your father and mother, and then I will earn enough money to go back to my home again." "And would you go back, Otto, and' leave me?" said Ebba, the tears starting to her eyes. "Perhaps," replied Otto, " your papa and mamma would go back with me, and we will all go to Blommaholme together. Oh, how I wish we were there now. There is Mr. de Garcia,   248    THE LAST OF HS NAME. such a kind gentleman, with a room full to the ceiling with books." "Picture books?" interrupted Ebba, deeply interested in Otto's recital. "Picture books  Whole shelves of them, and maps, and great globes! Then Mr. de Gar- cia explains all the pictures, and gives me the best books to read, and if you were there he would give you some also. He loves girls very much. He had a daughter once who married a gentleman from America, and he used to talk to me about her so sorrowfully that I would weep. When we reach America I shall inquire where Mr. Denys, her husband, lives; and if I find him he will help us, for Mr. de Garcia told me that he was a good man." Two weeks after this conversation, Ebba's mother, who had, been languishing in sickness a.    THE LAST OF HS NAME.     249 throughout the entire voyage, fell asleep in the / arms of death. The corpse was immediately prepared for burial, and the next morning was committed to the deep. A Lutheran clergyman read the burial service at sea, which sad task he had been called to perform on several preceding occasions. The afflicted husband gazed upon the spot in the water which had received the remains of his wife; he clasped his daughter to his heart, then placing her in Otto's arms, he sprang upon the railing, and before the asto- nished spectators could prevent him, he leaped into the sea. A boat was Jimmediately lowered; but no traces of the unfortunate man could be found. He had gone to seek his wife. And now the cabin passengers discovered that they possessed hearts to sympathize even with the poor emigrants. An officious gentle-   250   THE LAST OF HS NAME. man, who had made himself noted for his skill in inventing and arranging novel methods of amusement, now went from passenger to passen- ger, and collected money for the unfortunate children. When they had witnessed Otto's pre- servation from death, they had considered hitm sufficiently rewarded by a free passage to Ame- rica, and the trouble taken to rescue him; but now he was invested with the charm of romance. Ebba was a beautiful grl, and Otto a youth of noble bearing. "What a charming couple they will make when they ate olderl" whispered an elegant lady to the -gentleman aforesaid. "Beautiful l" exclaimed the little gentleman; "'and when they are married, for they certainly will be, what a nice little romance their lives would make"     -    -TEE LAST OF HS NAME.    5 "Excellentl charming deliciousl" re-echoed on all sides, and now Otto's fortunate star was in the ascendant. He at once became a general favorite, and Ebba was taken under the parti- cular care of two young ladies, who wished to gain favor in the eyes of the little gentleman, who, in his exertions for their amusement, had won their highest regard. During theremainder of the voyage, both Otto and Ebba received much kindness; but when the vessel arrived at its place of destination, and when the two young ladies, the self-elected guardians of Ebba, per. ceived that the little gentleman no longer no. ticed them, they abandoned their charge, and once more Ebba was under the sole protection of Otto. He had carefully hoarded the money he had received by the sudden generosity of the passengers, and upon the arrival of the ship, he ^ ra of th shp he   252    THE LAST OF HS NAME. caused all of Ebba's property to be conveyed, to a hotel, and then went thither with Ebba. While their money lasted they experienced no difficulties. Each day Otto would go forth into the crowded streets of the great city, and inquire of all who would notice him, concerning the residence of Mr. Edmund Denys; but to his dismay he found himself in a city where his wants could not be made known. This was an obstacle, to surmount which he was totally un- prepared. At length their stock of money was exhausted, and the landlord expelled them from the house, keeping Ebba's trunks, that con- tained the property of her dead parents, as secu- rity for the payment of their arrears. A11 that day tiey wandered, hand in hand, through the thronged streets. In vain were Otto's efforts to state the cause of his distress. Those who did   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    258 stop to hear him could not comprehend his lan- guage, and therefore hurried away. Disheartened with their many failures, and fatigued by their long wanderings, they sat down upon a stone door-step, and here, providentially, they were discovered by those whom they had so long and vainly sought.   CHAPTER     XIX. MRS. BLACK'S PARTY. MONDAY arrived. Upon the evening of that day, Mrs. Black was to give her party. Otto and Ebba had become established guests of the house, as Mrs. Denys had informed her host of her husband's determination - to take them with him upon his return home. That afternoon, while Ida and her mother were at their toilet, her father hastily entered the room. " My dear Blanche," said he, "I have joyful news for you." "What " exclaimed Blanche, "have you received a letter from home?" m   THE LAST OF HS NAEt,    ap5 "No, but I have this day, for the first time since our marriage, heard of your father. Who do you imagine the young Swede is?" "Tell me all, husband," replied his wife, almost breathless with suspense. "In one word, he is no other than Otto Kuller, the only son of Klas Hans Kuller, and Greta his wife. You wh remember that I had the honor of officiating at the wedding festival as Master of the Ceremonies." "Is Ebba his sister?" inquired Blanche, her countenance evincing the joy she experi- enced at receiving the unexpected news. "No, but if you will come to the parlor I will bring him to you, and he can then tell his own story."' His wife quickly finished dressing, and hastened to the pirlor. Ida, who expected to - J    266    THE LAST OF HS NAME. create a little sensation that evening, paid more attention to the arrangement of her toilet, and therefore did not accompany her mother to the parlor. So much was she occupied with her laces, ribbons, and jewelry, that she had scarcely heard the conversation between her parents. That morning Mr. Black had informed her, with a peculiar expression of countenance, that Mr. Frederick Brown, an exceedingly gentlemanly young man, was to be present that evening, and therefore she must, to use his own words, " look her handsomest." Ida's little heart was filled with an ardent desire to please Mr. Frederick, for during her visit she had heard much con. cerning that young gentleman. Therefore she selected her dress and ornaments for that even- ing with more than usual care; and after her mother had left the room, she went to Mrs. ID ,    THE LAST OF HS NAME.     257 Black's apartment to consult that lady in regard to the manner in which an. elegant silver orna- ment for the hair should be worn. She could not determine whether it looked better on the right or the left side; although she had experimented for full half an hour before the mirror. In the meantime Mrs. Denys was eagerly engaged in conversation with Otto. Question after question was showered upon the boy with such rapidity that he could, in' his confusion, scarcely reply to them. At length Mr. Denys came to his relief, and requested him to give a full account of the state of affairs at Blomma- holme. Otto at once proceeded with his narra- tive, and when he told them how often the old man had spoken to him of his absent daughter, tears of joy started to Blanche's eyes. Her 12*   258    THE LAST OF HS NAME. father had freely forgiven her. He loved her yet, and her absence grieved him. "But why," she inquired, "why did my father not write to me?" "Ah," replied  Otto, "Mr.. de. Garcia, although he received your letters, never broke the seals. Many times has he shown them to me, and then he would say, 'my daughter lives, and is well, thank God for that; this is her hand- writing." I once asked him to read them to me, but he frowned deeply and walked backwards and forwards, his eyes flashing so horribly that I was afraid of him. After that he showed me no more letters, although he often spoke of you to me." As Otto thus spoke, Blanche wept bitterly. "Oh," sobbed she, " will it ever be thus?" "No, my wife," replied her husband, deeply   I , THE LAST 'OF HS NAME.     2 259 affected. "' We will write to honest Klas Hans informing him of his son's safety, and in the letter will also address our father entreating him to write to us. Klas will read the letter to him, and he, I am sure, cannot refuse our request. If we do not receive a reply, next spring we will return to Blommaholme, and then, when he be- holds his long absent daughter, if he refuses to pardon and receive us both, he is not worthy the name of father." And Otto will intercede for us," said his wife, smiling through her tears. "Will you not, Otto?" "That I will," replied Otto, fairly dancing with joy at the thought of returning to his be- loved home. That afternoon Mr. Denys wrote a letter to Klas, inclosing a few lines from his wife to her   260    THE LAST OF HS NAME. father. Otto hastened to Ebba, and related his good fortune. In his joy at so unexpectedly finding a protector he had neglected to inquire before that day for the residence of Edmund Denys. Upon doing so his surprise and joy can be imagined when he discovered the friend of his parents in the person of his protector. Ebba re- joiced with her youthful friend. He was now her only protector on earth, and when the sun of fortune shone on him its rays warmed her heart also. So she chatted and laughed with him in high glee. Her little heart bounded with joy, as her adopted brother pressed her to his heart, and vowed that nothing should separate them. She should go with him wherever he went. His home should be her home, and his friends her friends, and when he should return to Blom- maholme, she should be a daughter to his parents.   THE LAST OF, HS NAME.    261 While they were thus indulging in bright an- ticipations of the future, they were interrupted by the appearance of Mr. Denys, who informed them that they would be expected in the parlor that evening. Ebba was so overjoyed at this news that she leaped with delight. Otto received the invitation with a grave countenance, he did not feel inclined to mingle with strangers; but as Ebba wished much to be present, he consented to go, and they at once commenced making pre- parations. The evening came, and with it arrived the guests. A moustached Frenchman seated him- self at the piano, and the young people immedi- ately arranged themselves for a dance. Mr. Frederick Brown was presented to Ida by Mr. Black, and the young couple took their places upon the floor. The music commenced,   262    THE LAST OF HS NAME. and soon the room   swarmed with merry dancers. In the meantime the elder portion of the guests were seated upon sofas, and chairs drawn closely against the wall, that they might not in- terfere with the dancers. Mr. Jenkins, the author, was here a lion. Hie was seated in a corner of the room, surrounded by a group of friends and admirers, who listened eagerly to the words of wisdom that dropped from his lips. "Ah! Mr. Jenkins, good evening," said Mrs. Donavan, a bulky, bustling lady, as she crowded her way to a chair by his side. She was a lady noted for her literary tastes, and her greatest joy consisted- in holding conversations with real authors. She read every romance that was is- sued from the press, and loved to edify her friends by quoting from them. Her favorite Y   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    268 author was Dickens, and she would dilate upon his merits, with great gusto. But the group was so much interested in Mr. pJenkins's conversation that the good lady had not an opportunity of edging in a single word. Suddenly Ebba, clothed in a pure white dress, entered the gay apartment accompanied by Otto, who gazed upon the be. wildering scene with confused astonishment. All eyes were instantly turned upon the youthful couple, and a break occurred in Mr. Jenkins's cataract of words. "-How that dear little girl in white 'reminds me of little Nell in the Old Curiosity Shop," ex, claimed Mrs. Donavan, so loudly that she at once attracted the attention of the little audience around her. "You have read Dickens, have you not, Mr. Jenkins?" Mr. Jenkjns bowed silently.   264    THE LAST OF HS NAME. "Oh, I like Oliver Twist," said Mrs. Dona- van, now in her element. "'Don't you remem- ber how he asked for more? and how he went to see his little friend and found him dead? and how old Squeers used to treat him so bad- ly? and how he went to sea, with old captain Scuttle? and how he came back all safe, and be- came acquainted with Joe Bagstock-Major Joe, you know, whose wife had twins? and how his mother was spontaneously burned? and how at length he married his own little love, his child wife. Oh, it was delicious! Then you must have read Pickwick, of course you have. Wasn't it funny when he found the old grave-stone, that wasn't one? And then he went out and shot himself in his limb. Oh, I adore' good old Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Dickens is my favorite author; but I do think he has failed a little in   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    265 Bleak House. I read an odd number the other' day, just to see; but I shall not read it all until I can have it at once. Then I will devour it." It is uncertain how long Mrs. Donavan would have thus continued, had she not been interrupt- ed by a peculiar smile upon the author's lips, and by a titter which pervaded throughout her audience, that had largely increased in- numbers, as the lady's eloquence had attracted universal attention. Mrs. Donavan blushed deeply, and fanned herself vigorously, and although the name of her favorite author, was mentioned several times in the course of the evening, she forbore making any comment. Mr. Frederick Brown, in the meantime, was. endeavoring to make himself agreeable to his young companion. He was a spruce little gen- tleman, nearly nineteen years of age; his upper   266    THE LAST OF HS NAME. lip bore slight evidence that he was endeavoring to cultivate a moustache, and he uttered his words with a fashionable drawl, and when speaking of his companions, called them " fellows." He was dressed in the height of fashion, and affected a partiality for Byron. During his first interview with Ida, he attempted to impress her with the belief that he was -desperately in love -with some fair unknown, and that some insurmountable obstacle prevented him from wedding the object of his adoration; at the same time taking an opportunity of quoting, "Oh I memory, torture me no more, The present's all o'ercast, My hopes of fortune's bliss are o'er In mercy veil the past." Ida was disappointed. In her imagination   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    267 she had considered Mr. Frederick the beau-ideal of all that was noble and gentle; but her quick perception had found him a vain and selfish fop. At the conclusion of the dance she hastened to. her parents, who were gazing upon their beauti- ful daughter with delight and satisfaction, and declared she would not again dance with Frede- rick Brown. Otto and Ebba, during the continuance of the dance, had remained alone together, gazing upon the gay spectacle; but upon its conclusion they advanced to Mrs. Denys, and were presented to Ida, who, until that evening, had been so much engaged with Mrs. Black that she had not found time to converse with them. Ebba approached Ida, her face beaming with gentle confidence, and Ida felt. within her heart that she should love her very much. Otto's noble form  and   268    THE LAST OF HS NAME. manly bearing, Ida contrasted with the effemi- nate Frederick, and the latter sank lower in her opinion than before.- "You do not dance, Otto?" said Mr. Denys, with a smile. 'I have asked Ebba to dance with me," replied Otto, "but she was afraid to do so before so many." At this moment the pianist commenced a waltz. Otto cast an entreating look towards Ebba, who nodded her head pleasantly. He en- circled her waist with his arm, and they floated around the room. All eyes were turned to- wards the elegant couple. Otto was an accom- plished dancer, and Ebba, beautiful and graceful in her every movement, entered into the spirit of the dance with an animation that caused her cheeks to glow and her eyes to glisten.   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    269 "Who is that, young lady, Mr. Black?" in- quired Frederick. "A Miss Justina, a Swedish young lady, an acquaintance of Mr. Denys." "And who is her partner?" "Otto Kuller, a Swede; her lover, I think." "Her lover!" exclaimed Frederick, biting his lips. "You will introduce me to her, will you not?" "Certainly; but I must tell you in advance that she cannot speak a word of English." This was unfortunate, for Frederick prided himself upon his conversational powers; but as he was also vain of his personal appearance, and as, in his estimation, Ebba was the belle of the evening, he was at the close of the dance intro- duced to her, and to Otto's chagrin, walked away with her in triumph. Otto danced with   270    TtHE LAST OF HS NAME. Ida in the same quadrille with Mr. Frederick and Miss Justina, and as he could converse with his partner no more than Ebba could with Fre- derick, he chatted with his adopted sister be- tween the changes of the quadrille. At this Frederick was much vexed, and as he, in his pride, kept aloof from Ida, she was obliged to remain in silent inactivity during the pauses of the dance. At length supper was announced, and the guests marched arm-in-arm  to an adjoining apartment, so small that there was barely space for the guests between the walls anti the great table which stood in the centre of the room. Mrs. Black had spared neither pains nor expense in preparing and arranging the supper table. Tall pyramids of ice cream, and capacious tu- reens of oyster soup, ornamented either extremity   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     271 of the table; and in the centre stood a large dish of Charlotte Russe, flanked on each side by blanc-manges, moulded in the forms of setting hens, geese, and crouching lions. The cake-. baskets were crowded with rich fruit and pound- cakes, and dishes of almonds, grapes, and con- fectionery completed the lading of the table. Upon a small sideboard, in a corner, stood the coffee urn, under the protection. of a large lady of African extraction, with a huge crimson tur. ban bound about her sable brows. Upon the same table were also placed slender bottles of champagne, and  round  dumpy decanters of brandy, and port and madeira wines. The space around the table was literally crazmmed with the guests. While some gentlemen were vainly endeavoring to force their way towards the table to procure  refreshments for their respective   272    THE LAST OF HS NAME. ladies, who were leaning resolutely against the walls; others, more fortunate, with dishes of oys- ters and cups of coffee in their hands elevated in the air, were struggling in an opposite direc- tion, and spilling the contents of the cups and dishes down the backs of those who unfor- tunately obstructed their passage. At length each lady and gentleman was provided with refreshments which they vainly strove to put to their lips. Cups and saucers, plates andspoons were dashed to the floor, and each catastrophe was followed by shouts of laughter. Elderly gentlemen sought refuge in corners, and in- dulged in sundry glasses, of brancdy and water; while young beaux ran hither and Ither with bottles of champagne from which they filled the ladies' wineglasses, only that their foaming con- tents might be spilled upon the carpet. In spite   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    273 of all these little inconveniences the guests were merry and talkative. Mrs. Donavan alone was ill-humored. Mr. Frederick, in his earnest en-, deavor to present Ebba with a dish of ice-cream, unfortunately received a severe blow from ano- 'ther gentleman, who was bowing deeply to Ida. The consequence was that Mrs. Donavan's ele- gant silken gown was deluged with the contents of the dish which Mr. Frederick was politely tendering to Ebba. The young gentleman was full of apologies; but the old lady, boiling over with wrath, suddenly ceased her lively conversa- tion with Mrs. Jenkins, and elbowed her way out of the room. ' The conclusion of the supper was the signal for departure. Guest after guest took his leave, and soon the parlors, a short time before brilliant and gay, were deserted and dark. 13-S   24    TEHE LAST OF HS NAME, A few days afterwards, Mr. Denys and his family, accompanied by Otto and Ebba, com- menced their journey homeward, after tendering an invitation to Mr. and Mrs. Black to spend a few, weeks during the autumn at Bed Creek Farm. The invitation was accepted, and Mrs. Black hinted that she might probably bring a friend with her. Mrs. Black and Mrs. Brown, now fully reconciled, 'became as intimate as their hus- bands could wish. But poor Frederick, his mind was. solely  engrossed with thoughts of Ebba.  His, face became pale, and thin, he smoked cigars incessantly, and when he thought of Otto, he would compress his lips and clench his hands.  Mr. Black observed the changed appearance of his friend's son, and took occasion to whisper to him--' Ah,   THE LAST OP HS NAME.    275  Brown, Fred has caught the malady; I knew he could not withstand Miss Ida's charmsl"   CHAPTER XX. THE, LETTER. "HERE is a letter for you, from America," said old Mr. de Garcia one morning, as he entered the fisherman's cottage. Klas Hans, with his face buried in his hands, was sitting near the window, while Greta was seated by his side with her knitting work. Often was she interrupted in her occupation as she raised her hands to her weeping eyes, to wipe away the quickly gathering tears. "From Americal" exclaimed Klas Hans, suddenly arising from his chair. He tore open the seal, and his face suddenly became radiant   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    2" with smiles of joy, while tears of gladness streamed down his, cheeks, amidst the smiles, like a summer shower on a sunny day.: "Read, Greta, read," he stammered, extend- ing the letter to his wife. Greta took the letter with tremblings hands, and when .her eyes glanced over the first line, she sank back in her chair overcome with gratitude and joy. "What is in the letter," exclaimed de Gard cia, snatching the paper from Greta's hand, "that it affects you so?"  "Read it aloud,' entreated Klas, "thatI may know that it is not a deception of m i magination." Mr. de Garcia opened the letter and read as follows: : "MY DEAR KLAS HANS: Prepare yourself for joyful news. Your son Otto is still alive."   ^t8    -S- L TAST IFS HS9 NTAME. "Can it be possible?" murmured the old man, the. tears blinding his eyes until the words swam together; but wiping his spectacles, #he recom- menced. "Not only isy our son alive; but he thas found protection beneath the roof of your old friend. By the merest accident I met him in the streets of this great'city, and without knowing whom I was befriending, I resolved to protect him, for he was a native of the same land which gave birth to my, beloved wife, and he was in distress. With him I found -a, beauti- ful young creature, Ebba Justiha, with whom he beeame acquainted during his voyage in the ship -that rescued him from death.

De Garcia hastened to his library, and open- ing the drawer of a small desk he took forth a package of letters, each addressed to him in the writing of his daughter. He untied the parcel, and examined letter after letter, whilst his tears fell thick and fast upon them. One letter bore a late date upon the postmark. He paused, his fingers trembled upon the seal. Then with exclamation of passion he arose from his chair, and walked hurriedly to and fro. His lips were closely compressed, and his eyes glistened, not with tears, but with the rage which he had col- lected within himself. He returned to the desk, and calmly replaced the letters within .the drawer. He experienced a strange and unnatu- ral joy in thus revenging himself upon his inno-   THE LAST OF.

IS*   CHAP-TER     XXI. \      '   / THE UNEXPECTED GUEST. DURING their homeward journey, Ida by signs and gestures made known to Ebba that thenceforward they were to be warm friends. Mr. Denys observed this, and said laughingly to Ida, that she must teach her young friend the English, and in return receive instructions from Ebba in the Swedish. - "Yes, my dear child," said his wife, "and I hope you will prove a more attentive scholar to your young teacher than you have to me." "Otto also must be admitted to the circle. We shall turn our parlor into a little academy,   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     288 and thea I hope   the young  people will come to a better understanding  with each other," said Mr. Denys in Swedish to Otto, and his remarks were interpreted to' Ida by her mother. ' This plan was adopted joyfully, and a few days after their arrival home, it was put into operation. It was a pleasant sight when Ida and her young companions were gathered around the centre table in the parlor, with their books, to observe with what eagerness they devoted themselves to their tasks, in which they were oc- casionally assisted by Mr. Denys and his wife. So earnest were they in their studies that scarce six weeks had passed before they were able to understand each other. Ida'sh former lessons from her mother -were of so much benefit that she could speak the language of her young com.   284    THE LAST OF HS NAME. panions before they could overcome the difficul- ties of the English. "Oh," frequently sighed Ebba, casting aside her book pettishy, " who can ever learn this hiss- ing language? It is fit only for geese!" But stimulated by Otto's success, she continued her exertions until she had fairly mastered it, although she never lost a slight foreign accent that added to, rather than diminished the sweet- ness of her voice. The month of September arrived, and still the young people continued their studies, which were soon interrupted, how- ever, by a sudden and totally unexpected arrival,.               . "I say, Missus Lisbeth," said Romulus, one afternoon, to our ancientlend, who was gravely watching her sable associate as he was emptying a basket of unshelled corn int:the trough of the   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    :285 pig-sty, "I was out in the meadow a little while ago, to drive in the cows, and what do you think I saw?"   "I don't know, Mr. Romulus," replied Mrs. Lisbeth, in her mixture of English, Swedish, and negro dialects, which we shall not attempt to imitate, " unless it was one of the pale warners." "Pale warners!" echoed Romulus, with a laugh, "I guess it was, he was pale enough, and muddy enough too I think."  "Whbat was it?"  "It was a something dressed in  panta- loons, black coat with velvet collar, its vest, morocco boots, and a wide straw hat. Least- ways he was once dressed so; but. when I helped him out of the swamp near the creek, he was all one color, and tthat was green; very green. He said he had  gun, but I couldn't find it.   286    -THE' LAST OF HS NAME. o    Suppose it sank in the mire, if he had had oile." "What did you do with him?" "Oh,- be asked me if I knew where Mr. Denys -lived. Of course I did, so I brought him to the house, and he went into the parlor, I think." "Into the parlor 1" exclaimed Lisbeth. "He will ruin the carpet," and away the old lady ran, to prevent the catastrophe, if possible. Ida, Otto, and Ebba were seated near the table with their books in their hands, when Ebba accidentally glanced towards the door. To her astonished eyes was presented a form the ridi- culous appearance of which caused her to laugh outright. Upon the threshold of the door stood Mr. Frederick Brown, dripping with moisture, and encased from head to foot in a green coating of filth from the mire into wtich he had fallen.   THE LAST: OF HS NAME.    28 Otto and Ida looked towards the strange figure, and both, burst' forth into a scream of laughter; but instantly checking themselves as they recog- nised the intruder, they were about to welcome 'him, and apologize for their rudeness, when a third actor appeared-on the scene, in: the person of the indignant Lisbeth, who seized the unfor,- tunate young gentleman by the collar, and by main strength dragged him to the porch, in spite of his shrieks and struggles. "There," exclaimed she, gasping for breath, "dry yourself in the sun before you enter a gen- tleman's parlor," and without waiting: his reply the old lady vanished as suddenly as she had appeared. Ida and Ebba instantly proceeded to the door, and requested Frederick to enter, at the same-time .requesting him to pardon the roughness of his reception. He entered the hall   288    THE LAST OF HS NAME. ,and was immediately conducted to Otto's apart- ment,: where he was supplied with clean cloth- ing. After completing his toilet, accompanied by Otto, Frederick returned to'the parlor, where in merry conversation with the young ladies he soon forgot his sad mishaps, even taking great pleasure in: recounting them to his companions. "'I thought," said he, pompously, "that I, having been so much confined in the city, would take an excursion into the country to hunt and fish, two sports of which I assure you I am very fond. Remembering you, I thought I would come out this way, and was on my road hither, with my gun, for I fancied I might shoot some- thing on the way, when in attempting to cross a frog pondponon a round and slippery log, I lost my footing and fell in, and perhaps I would have perished, for the pond was 'deep, and the   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    289 banks miry, had not I been rescued by a worthy black fellow, who left me here and departed be, fore I could reward him; but I shall find him and pay him handsomely for his services." "You will not have to seek far," said Ida, "for your preserver can be no other than Romu- lus, my father's servant." The entrance of Mr. Denys and his wife in- terrupted the conversation. They cordially welcomed Frederick, and invited him to spend a few weeks with them, which invitation was eagerly accepted. Lisbeth announced supper, and soon they were gathered around the table. By the merest accident Frederick found himself seated (at Ebba's side. He was delighted with the progress she had made in her studies of the English language, for now he thought, he could not fail to attract her attention.   290    THE LAST OF HS N'AME. During her short life, Ebba had not received gallant attentions from a gentleman, and what, young lady of sixteen summers can listen to the flatteries and compliments of her first admirer with a careless earl To all of his words Ebba listened' with pleasure, and the English language assumed a novel beauty when uttered by hi lips. In broken language sh6 replied to ,  words, and'so much oc- cupied were they with each other, that their companions at the table were entirely forgot- ten. "Oh," said Frederick in a low tone, "I am delighted that you are learning our language. You will soon be able to read the writings of the divine Byron, and in them you will find beauties that cannot be found in the works of any other author. How well he depicts, in Childe Harold,   TBE.

"Yes," interrupted Mr. Denys, with a smile, "and Biron, in Love's Labor's Lost, says.: "Well learned is that tongue, that well can thee recommend: All ignorant that soul, that sees thee without wonder." "I beg your pardon, Mr. Denys," exclaimed Frederick hastily, "but Byron did     not write Love's Labor's Lost.!' Shakspeare wrote it.'  A'And so he did," replied Mr. Denys, with peculiar eniphasis, L"but the quotation   is apt nevertheless.  It is rare indeed that we find one so young as you so well versed in the works of the great authors in our language."   -292   TlE LAST' OF HS NAME. Frederick blushed deeply. He was uncer- tain whether Mr. Denys's compliment was ironi- cal or earnest, but still the lesson produced its in. tended effect. He quoted Byron no more that evening, and resolved to read "Love's Labor's Lost" the next morning. At the conclusion of supper the company proceeded to the parlor. Mrs. Denys seated herself at the piano, and the young people arrayed themselves for a dance, while Mr. Denys, standing near the piano, looked on with an approving smile. Otto and Ida formed -a lovely couple, and as Mr. Denys gazed upon them his mind was filled with many little plots for their future happiness. Wearied with dancing they seated themselves in a circle around the table, and amused themselves with innocent games and, amusements, while Blanche   TH E LASTS OF HS NAME.   293; and her husband were poring over the chess board. Chess was a favorite amusement with them.. To -it they were indebted for their present happiness. While they were thus engaged a loud knock at the hall door, and. the shuffling of many feet, announced visitors. The new comers were ad. mitted, - and lo I Mr. and Mrs. Black, and their friends Mr.. Brown and wife, entered the parlor. "We have availed ourselves of your invita- tion, Mrs. Denys," said Mrs. Black, returning a kiss of welcome with which she, had been greeted.

HEARTBURNINGS. IDA and Ebba occupied the same bed-cham- ber, and they had snugly ensconced themselves beneath the blankets, when Ida, who was possess- ed with an unusual spirit of wakefulness, whis- pered to her companion--"What do you think of our city gentleman, Ebba? Does not green become his complexion well?" "Poor fellow!" replied Ebba with' a sigh. "Although I could not but laugh at his ridicu- lous appearance, still I pitied him from the bot- tom of my heart.

He must be a very talented young man, he is so familiar with the writings of those great authors." "Oh, yes," said Ida with a, laugh, "'but I think that papa dashed his ardor a little by that quotation from Shakspeare. I could not eiactly understand it; but I knew from papa's counte- nance, that he was reading him a; little lesson." "Well, whatever you say to the contrary, I think that Mr. Broan is an agreeable and inte- resting young man. Now Otto is really becom- ing quite stupid 1" "Stupid!" exclaimed& Ida hastily, "Otto stupid I You at Smistaken, Miss Ebba; Otto is not only intelligent and agreeable, -t he is al- ways kind and attentive." "Just so," replied Ebba, " neither hot nor cold. Oh, I sometimes wish that he would be,   298    THE LAST OF HS SAME. dome angry with me that I might see him exci- ted once in his life." "Ebba, Ebba," said Ida reproachfully, "do you thus speak of one to whom you are so much indebted?"- '( That is the very reason, Ida. You cannot imagine how disagreeable it is to be indebted to another without the power -of ever repaying him; but still Otto is kind to me, and I love him very much, yet if he was a little' different I should love him more." A loud knock upon the opposite side of the wall near their bed, interrupted the conversation. "Come, young people,'" said Mr. Denys, whose bed-room was the adjoining apartment, "it is time to sleep. Your talking disturbs us." Thus silenced, Ida and Ebba ceased convers- ing, and after kissing each other " good night," ' *   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    299 they closed their eyes and soon were sleeping soundly. The next morning, Mr. Brown held a private conversation with his -son. "Well, Frederick," said he, " what do you think of the lovely Miss Ida? Is she not a pearl? I saw her glance roguishy at you, last night, so do not fear; but commence your suit" like a mans and a lover. Girls like nothing better than gallant attentions, so spare neither flatteries nor compliments. Do you not feel your hearst warming for her?

I only wished to hint to you that it would afford me the highest pleasure to see you united: to Miss Denys. Proceed with your suit with the   300'   THEI LASt OF HS NAME. strongest assurances of success. Her parents will at once consent, for Mrs. Black has sounded-them both, and she told your mother that there is nothing to- fear on that score. I am the more desirous that you should wed Miss Ida, as the plan is one of Mr, Black's concocting, and he is a man whose opinion should be respected," Frederick listened to his father's words in the utmost impatience. If he had ever adrmitd Ida, all sentiments of love  her had been eradi* cated from, his heart, by the cool politeness with which she invariably treated him. His pride had taken offence at her manner of conduct to- wards him; -but Ebba, the gentle, the rofsantid Ebbsa looked upon him, he fancied, with the eyes of love, She alone, he felt could render himn happy. But his. fears would' not permit him to tell his father of his preference. In vain did   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    801 he endeavor to trace out a path which would conduct him safely forth from the maze in which he found himself. At length, however, he deter. mined to leave everything to time; in the hope that something would occur to the advantage of his hopes.. In Otto he saw a dangerous rival, but he observed something in Ebba's counter nance when speaking to Otto, that bade him hope she loved him only as a brother, from motives of gratitude. He also fancied that Otto looked upon Ida with stronger affection than his appa. rent  situation seemed to warrant; but) the fickle Ida he could not fathom, save that he knew  she experienced an aversion for him- self, which sentiment his heart reciprocated cordially. ! As we have thus peered into the recesses of Frederick's heart, we will also lay bare the work- tt      /   802    THE. LAST OF HS NAME. ings of the palpitating organs of his young com- panions. Ebba, when she arose that morning, was sad. She thought of her former home; of her be- loved parents, and their painful death. Then as an angel of consolation, appeared to her the form of Otto.' In her heart, he occupied a firm seat; but still she felt that she did not love him as she should. Why was it that another form glided between them, driving Otto from her mind? Since the evening she had first met Frederick his form was ever before her eyes; and Otto, who until that night-had ever been uppermost in her mind, was now looked upon as one whom duty alone compelled her to love. "I wonder," thought she, " whether Otto really loves me, loves me as lovers do of whom we read in books? If he does, my heart must close itself to all except him,   THE LAST OF -HS NAME.    803 for to him I owe everything; but why is it I cannot love him as I do another, almost a stran- ger to me? God help me to do right. My duty calls me to Otto, my heart bids me seek Frede- rick. To whom shall I go? I must speak to Otto." Ida was seated near the table turning over the leaves of a book. Her eyes were turned steadfastly upon Ebba; but she saw her not. "Does Otto love Ebba?" thought she, " if so, he has thrown his heart away. She loves him not, for love would not speak as she spoke last night. I love him not, and yet I grieve that she who should love Otto is beloved by him. His noble heart is worthy the deepest affection of a tender woman. How unselfsh is he, and how many sacrifices he has made for Ebba, and yet she loves him not!  Strange! should I thus be   804    THE LAST OF HS NAME. placed, how much I would love him. My life, my heart should be his, my every exertion should be to promote his happiness. But," and she sighed deeply, "Ebba may love him yet." In the summer-house in the garden sat Otto, near the water trough, in which the trout was playing. "Ah I little trout," said, Otto, in a whisper, "you are somewhat like me. Four mossy walls hem you in, while I am imprisoned by my duty and my honor. Ebba believes my heart is hers, and she, I feel, loves me; and should I Wt aside her affection I would be unworthy the name of man. Alone, looking upon me as her only protector, she hopes to find me ever so, and yet my heart does not respond to her love. Oh, that we had never come to this house I that' I had never beheld the daughter of my father's   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    800 friend Ebba then could( have possessed my whole heart; but now it must be apportioned between them, and I feel that Ida will possess the largest share. But Ebba shall never know this. I will do all that duty and affection can accomplish to cause her happiness, even should I myself be made miserable. But perhaps time and separation will estrange my heart from its wrongful love. When I take Ebba to my father's house, and she is received by my pa- rents as their daughter, perhaps then their love may also kindle a like sentiment within my breast. If Ebba was my sister how much I could love her as a brother ^but--Oh, I wish I was a trout, then I could swim about in the bright water the same as that little fellow, and know no sorrow l" "*   CHAPTER     XXIII. THE BIRTH-DAY FESTIVAL. IDA'S birth-day was fast approaching, and the poetic Frederick determined to prepare for the family a joyful surprise upon that occasion. He consulted with Otto and Ebba in relation to the arrangements. The rest of the family were to remain in profound ignorance with the excep- tion of Lisbeth and Romulus, for necessity com- pelled him to impart the secret to them. He proposed that the day should be celebrated after the manner of the days of chivalry, and Otto and Ebba joyfully adopted his plan. "You, Otto," said he, " must be a wandering s,   THE LAST OF HS NAME,.    07 bard, dressed in a flowing black gown, and must wear a long grey beard. You can take Mrs. Denys's harp and sing some ancient ballad before Ida, whom we shall address as queen." "That is excellent!" said Otto. "I know an old Pomeranian ballad which I will trans- late for the occasion." "That will be admirable!" "Whatshall I be?" inquired Ebba, eagerly.  "To tell you that, I must first inform you of the character I intend to personate," replied Fre- derick. "I shall be a Christian knight, one of the Crusaders, dressed in armor; and you, Ebba, shall be the lady in whose honor I have per- formed my greatest deeds. You must be dressed in a  flowing white gown, ornamented with' bliue ribbons, and blue shall be my favorite color, therefore my lance must be' decorated with a   308    THE LAST OF HS NAME. blue pennant. Romulus must be a turbaned Mussulman, whom -I captured when I was fight- ing for the cross." "How beautiful that will bel" exclaimed Ebba; " but where shall we procure the proper dresses?" "Oh, I shall attend to that,"' replied Frederick, "I will write to a friend in the city, and request him to purchase such dresses as we require. You, Ebba, must consult Lisbeth in relation to the feast; she is a kind old lady, and will deny us nothing." "' That we need not fear," said Otto, "-for I have often heard my father say, that Lisbeth could arrange a wedding feast better than any other person; and if she could do that she can do as well with a simple birth-day dinner." "Well, then," said Frederick," everything is concluded upon, so we had better at: once pro-   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     809 ceed towards completing our arrangements, as we have no time to lose." The momentous day arrived. Frederick, a few days before, had received the various cos- tumes necessary for their little spectacle, and had given to all the performers their respective dresses. At an early hour he opened the win- dow to ascertain the state of the weather, and to6 his dismay, discovered that it was raining. That would entirely mar the plot, as it was intended that Ida should be conducted to the summer- house in the garden, where had been erected a throne for her accommodation. This part of the performance had been intrusted to Lisbeth, who was to request Ida, her parents, and their guests, to accompany her to the garden; but she was to do so in such a manner that they should suspect nothing.   . .   310    THE LAST OF HS NAME. "I say, Mrs. Lisbeth," said Romulus, sudden- ly entering the kitchen -after he had dressed him- self for the character he was to assume, " how do I look?" "Like a Roman hero!" exclaimed Lisbeth, elevating her hands in astonishment. "'The crimson turban contrasts remarkably well with your complexion, and that crooked sword looks fierce and warlike; but I am afraid the rain will spoil all." "It's going to stop, for I saw a blue patch in the sky, and that's a certain sign," replied Ro- mulus. Before eleven. o'clock, the rain ceased, thus verifying the old proverb, "Rain before seven," etc. etc., and Otto and Ebba conducted by Fre- derick, and followed by Romulus, proceeded to the summer-house. Frederick was clothed in a   THE LAST OF- HS NAME.   3" complete suit of gilded pasteboard, which in fact much resembled the armor of ancient knights. In his right hand he held a long wooden lance, and in his left a gilded shield, and from behind his left shoulder rose the handle of a long wood- en sword, the point of which dangled between his heels, tripping him at every step. Otto was disguised by a mask with a long beard, and was clothed in a brown robe, the train dragging be- hind him on the ground. Around his waist was tied a hempen cord, and over his back was slung his harp. Ebba was elegantly attired in virgin white, ornamented with blue ribbons. Her head was crowned with an enormous tiara of mock jewels, and in one hand she bore a large fan made of peacock feathers, while in the other was a gilt paper crown which she was to place on Ida's head, after she had taken her seat.   812    THE LAST OF HS NAME. They arrived at the :summer-house, and Fre- derick and Ebba took their places at either side of the throne, which was decorated with flowers, and hung with gayly colored pennants. Romu- lus knelt at the foot of the throne, with his hands clasped over his head, according to the Oriental custom. Otto retired behind a tree, as he was not to appear until Ida was crowned. These positions the performers ochupied for nearly five minutes. No sound did they hear, save the ripple of the water in the trough upon which the throne had been erected. "They are not coming at all," exclaimed Ebba impatiently. "Yes, here they are," replied  Frederick, and soon they heard the sound of Lisbeth's voice. "This way, Miss Ida, if you please. In the   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    318 summer-house. I think it will be better for us to prepare the dinner table. In Sweden, on fes- tivals of this kind, in warm weather, we often have our feast in the open air, and it will be such a novel surprise for Mr. Frederick, don't you think so, Mrs. Bl6ck?" ' Oh, yes," replied Mrs. Black, and the others heartily concurred in her opinion. They entered the summer-house, and all were filled with wonder and admiration. They knew not which to admire most, the knight in silver armor, the maid in virgin white, the kneel- ing Turk, or the sumptuous throne. Advancing to Ida, the knight took her hand and conducted her to the throne. Surprised and bewildered, Ida seated herself, and was at that moment crowned by Ebba. Then the knight opened his lips and greeted her as follows:  . ,   314     THE LAST OF HS NRAME. "All hail our queen, a pattern to all princes, Most covetous of wisdom, and fair virtue. Possessing all the sovereign graces That mould up such a mighty piece as she is With all the virtues that attend the good. Still shall they be doubled on her, truth shall nurse her, Holy and heavenly thoughts shall counsel her. She shall be loved by all, and all shall bless her. All hail our queen, a pattern to all princes." "The rogue has been improving Shak- speare," whispered Mr. Denys to his wife; "but what have we here?" Otto now  entered' the  summer-house, and knelt before the throne.  "O mightiest of sove- reigns," said he in a feeble voice, " will it please you to listen to a ballad from  an aged harper? One who has travelled from afar, to appear be- i fore you at this time." Ida, entering into the spirit of the jest, bowed her head condescendingly. "Listen then," said the harper, "my dolo-   THE L ST OF HS NAME.     815 rous ditty tells a tale of faithful lover and faith- less maid. That you may understand it I must show from whence it came, and how it derived its name. 'The Pale Warners,' it is called, most gracious lady; the scene is laid in Pomerania, near the margin of a lovely lake. The incidents described occur in Pagan times, when the minds of people were in darkness. It is said that the lake of which the ballad treats, was the abiding place of an evil spirit, and whosoever fell into its waters must by his own exertions save his life. Should a man be rescued by a friend, a finger was cut from off his hand, and cast into the lake to appease the spirit's wrath; or else his body must be given to the lake that he might serve the spirit menially. Should a maiden chance to be preserved from drowningin its waters she also was obliged to undergo mutilation, else her body   816      THE LAST OF HS NAME./ was cast into the water, that she might become the spirit's bride.  Thus, lady, having made all ,clear, I will at once commence my ballad." Striking   the' strings of  the  harp, Otto sang, in a soft and melodious voice, the following verses:  "Beside a lake fair Jaseha stood To reach a pebble fain she would. But by a chance, oh, sad to tell She into the dark waters fell. "In vain her struggles, her young breath Had soon been hush'd in silent death. But Bogislaw, a noble boy, Sprang to her aid with eager joy. "He held her form so full of charms, And bore her in his tender arms To her father: a man of years, Whose grateful heart outpoured in tears Now came a priest with angry mien, ' What desecration have I seen ' Spake he, his beard all snowy white- ' You have enraged the water sprite.

The Gods are angered; sad thy lot, To wander ever on this earth, A stranger to thy land of birth.' "Sadly Bogislaw departed, Leaving Jascha broken-hearted. But quick she followed in his path, And prayed him not to go in wrath. "He clasped her to his heart, and said: 'Give me the little pebble red Which I did find clasped in thy hand, When first I drew thee to the land.' "She gave it him with many tears, 'Mayhap we'll meet in future years,' He said, and turned his steps away. His heart was dark; night was his day. "Years in their ceaseless course had rolled; Ten summers had ten winters told. The Christians came to heathen lands, In fierce and bloody warlike bands.

'In distant lands,' she said, 'Thou hast preserved that pebble red. "'By the great water sprite I swear My heart and fortune thou shalt share.' As thus she spake, arose a storm -And from the water reared- a form "Grim and ghastly, it shook its head, And then resumed its limpid bed. Her happy lover saw it naught. And now their homes the couple sought.   320     THE LAST OF HS NAME. In foreign lands with ardent heart, Bogislaw learned the founder's art. That he might in the temple swing Soft-sounding bells, With cheering ring. "E'er he had done his pleasant task A Saxon knight with polished casque, And armor bright, rode up and down Through the ancient heathen town.

"But he looked on Bogislaw's bride, To win her love was now his pride. His cunning tongue she listen'd to; Cast from her heart her lover true. And by the margin of the lake She forswore all for Ingert's sake. Her ring she from her finger drew, And in the water it she threw.   THE LAST OF HS NAME.         21 "Then rose the sprite with bloody knife, And shook it as to take her life, In fear she swoon'd, her head she pressed Upon her wicked lover's breast. "In a thicket Bogislaw stood, And saw the lovers as they wooed. With pallid cheek, and stony eye, He gazed awhile, then turned to fly. "He prostrate fell unto the ground, And senseless afterwards was found. Revived, they led him to the pot, Where glowed the metal fierce and hot, "With which the temple bells to cast. 'Stop,' cried Bogislaw, hot and fast, 'I to the bells must add a part, Endeared to me by broken heart "A golden ring I give the bell," And in the bubbling mass it fell, Then bowed he o'er the glowing brass, And whispered, then the molten mass Rushed forth a stream of liquid gold. Into the steaming sandy mould. "The bells were perfect and were hung While praises to the gods were sung, Their founder disappeared that day,' Whither he went no man could say. 15   322     THE LAST OF HS NAME. "Jascha became the Saxon's bride, Her father, broken-hearted, died. She found no peace, nor joy, nor rest, Within her faithless, fruitless breast, "Save only when the bells were rung With silver notes from iron tongue, Then did her heart in calmness beat, Her brain lost all its fever heat. "But now the Christian armies came, And, in religion's holy name, Deprived the pagans of their lands, And drove them forth in weeping bands. "Their bells the pagans took away, And now Jascha became a prey To tortures great; her soul was sad, Her mind was rack'd with fancies mad. (' The bells, the bells,' she cried, 'the bells, Oh, when their peaceful music swells I am at rest, oh, my dear lord, Bring them me back by word or sword.' "In a deep wood the bells were hung, Amidst the leafy limbs they swung, Ingert arm'd his men for slaughter, And went in ships across the water.

"The mast beneath the heavy weight, Tottered and fell; the spirit's hate Urged on the winds, the vessel sank, Beneath the'waters dark and dank. "Jascha clung to her husband's side, 'Save me from death,' she vainly cried, He drew a   dagger from his breast, And to her heart the steel he pressed. "She sank, her blood his lips did lave, Her did he slay, himself to save, Another corpse his eyeballs saw, It was the corpse of Bogislaw. "And even now the sound of bells, Upward from the water swells, Oft hand in hand two forms arise, One bleeding, and with tearful eyes.   324    THE LAST OF HS NAME. "These warners pale, those maidens rouse, Who would prove faithless to their vows. They show poor Jascha's punishment, ' Avoid her fate,' cry they, 'repent." "Thus, lady, have I -ended," continued Otto after a moment's pause. "And right glad am I, Otto," said Mr. Denys, with a laugh. "Although your ballad was very good for a poet so young and inexperienced in the language, it was somewhat long and tedious; and as it is dinner-time, throw off your masque- rading costume and let us all return, for my ap- petite is aroused and will not brook delay." "Not yet," said Ebba hastily, forgetting that as the Lady Dulcinea of a gallant knight, she should preserve due decorum, "Mr. Frederick has also to recite an original poem in honor of Ida's birth-day." "We will postpone it until evening," said 1 '    I   THE ,LAST OF HS NAME.    325 Ida, with a smile. "Our sovereign will should be respected, you know." "But who is this kneeling knave?" inquired Mr. Denys. "It's me, Master Edmund," replied Romulus, elevating his face, which was streaming with perspiration, called forth by the awkward and uncomfortable position he had occupied. "'I'm an Arab!" "'We have been delighted with your little play," said Mrs. Black, arising from the bench upon which the company had been seated during Otto's song; " but, as our good host says, it is time for dinner, so doff your masks and become as you were before." But Frederick had no wish to lose the plea- sure of wearing his suit of armor so soon; for he fancied that it became his person well. "Let us   326    THE LAST OF HS NAME. go to dinner as we are," said he. "I can eat with my helmet on; but," he whispered to Ebba, as he took her arm, ", who can think of so vulgar a thing as eating at such a time as this?"Ebba involuntarily pressed his arm, and Frederick's heart was so light and happy that he felt as though he was walking on air instead of the solid earth. Otto, however, gladly divested him- self of the awkward gown which covered his more modern clothing, and presenting his arm to Ida, they hastened after their companions, who were already on their way to the house, where Lisbeth had prepared an excellent dinner. After dinner a walk was proposed, and as Frederick found his armor awkward and uncom. fortable, he concluded to replace it with gar- ments more befitting. It was a beautiful after- noon, the sun shining with mellowed lustre upon   THE LAST OF HS NAME,    327 the earth, which was fast donning its autumnal guise. The company walked to a thick grove of maples, which shaded a mound, upon the banks of the creek, and the elderly portion seated themselves upon a fallen tree, to view the enchanting landscape, while" their young com- panions rambled hand in hand along the mossy banks of the rivulet. In the course of their wanderings Ebba and Frederick allowed their companions to proceed a considerable distance in advance, and when they were concealed from view by a slight bend in the stream, Frederick proposed that Ebba and himself should desert them, and return to the mound by a different path. Ebba at once consented, and they turned into the forest. Whether they were lost in the wood, or whether they were so much engaged in conver-    THE LAST OF HS NAME.  i i sation, that time slipped by unawares to them, is doubtful; but it is certain that they did not arrive at the mound until after Ida and Otto had reached it, and the company had returned to the house. In the meantime Mrs. Black had held an earnest conversation with Ida, with the endeavor to ascertain the true state of her heart towards Frederick. Her quick eye had observed that Ida glanced oft and earnest towards Otto; but the worthy lady considered him the betrothed of Ebba, and therefore did not think him a dan- gerous rival. Discovering that she could draw no confession from Ida, Mrs. Black went in search of Frederick, that she might advise him in relation to the plan he should pursue. She proceeded to the garden, and as she passed the summer-house, she heard the sound of whisper-   ing voices. She cautiously glanced intQ the summer-house, and discovered Otto and Ebba in familiar, and, as she considered, loving conversa- tion. A sudden thought entered her head, that now she could at once dispel all love that Ida might entertain for Otto. She returned to the parlor where she had left Ida, and requested her to walk to the summer-house, that they might sit and converse together in the cool of the even- ing. Ida at once consented, and they proceeded to the spot. Ida heard the sound of voices from the summer-house, and ceased walking. "Who are they, Ida?" inquired Mrs. Black. "Otto and Ebba 'I replied Ida, changing color rapidly. She understood them as they conversed, although, her companion did not, for they used their native language. Although her strict sense of right caused Ida to shrink from 15*   3880   THE LAST OF HS NAME. listening to them conversation, still her curiosity was so much aroused by the few words she had heard, that she could not resist from hearing more. "Do you really love me, Otto?" questioned Ebba, whose eyes were red and swollen with weeping. "I do, my good sister," replied Otto, kissing the tears from her eyes. "Oh, Otto," she cried, " why do you care for \. me? I am unworthy of your love; but still I feel that if you should hate me my heart would break."  "Speak not in that manner, my Ebba," replied Otto, gently. "My heart's strongest desire shall ever be to promote your happiness; but let us speak no further upon the subject. How did you like my ballad to-day?"   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     381 "It was too mournful, Otto; but do you think it is true? Do you believe that the pale warners really appear to faithless maids? And how odd it was," she continued in more lively tones, "your Saxon Ingert much resembled Mr. Brown, as he stood in his glistening armor. But did he sot look noble, Otto?" "That 'he did; but I could not keep from my mind that his shining suit was made of pasteboard; and .there was Romulus, poor fellow, how he must have suffered! On the whole I think the Turk was the best performer of us all, at least he took more pains. When is your birth-day, Ebba? Perhaps we will then have a little play also." , "Next month, Otto, 'but I wish no play, for I am very unhappy," replied Ebba, the tears again starting to her eyes.   832    THE LAST OF HS NAME. "Unhappy I my Ebba unhappy!" exclaimed Otto. "Why are you unhappy, Ebba?" "I do not know-at least I cannot tell; but promise me, Otto, never to hate me, and I will endeavor to be happy." "Then be happy, Ebba," replied Otto, warmly pressing her hand. "The sun will never shine upon the day when my love and esteem for you shall cease." The conversation ceased, and Ida and her companion hastily retreated. Mrs. Black per- ceived by the pain evinced in every lineament of Ida's countenance, that the words they had overheard were upon an interesting topic; and also, to her own disappointment, that Otto occu- pied a stronger and warmer place in Ida's heart than she had imagined. But the pain expressed in Ida's countenance, was quickly dispelled by a   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    338 flush of resentment frornc-wl Me Mrs. Black, a close observer of human nature, derived much consolation. In the height of her anger, she thought Ida would, for the sake of revenge, receive the attentions of Frederick with plea- sure. The wily Mrs. Black hastened to her friend, and bade- her hope that her son would succeed in his suit, and this joyful news Mrs. Brown hastened to convey to her husband.   CHAPTER XXIV. CONFUSION. THE next morning the house at Red Creek Farm was the scene of the utmost confusion. Mrs. Brown, in hysterics, was struggling upon the sofa, in the parlor; and Mrs. Black, pale with excitement and fear, was kneeling at her side applying to her nostrils a bottle of ammonia. Mr. Brown was pacing the floor, his face purple with rage, and his mouth emitting curses, while his friend Mr. Black was vainly endeavoring to pacify him. Their hosts, perplexed and anxious, gazed upon the scene in the utmost bewilderment, while Otto and Ida interchanged glances of astonishment.   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     3g5 "I will hear nothing," shouted Mr. Brown, "order my carriage instantly, if you please, Mr. Denys. I shall leave this house." "-But Mr. Brown," entreated his friend, "consider where you are; you are insulting your host, and exposing yourself to ridicule." "Am I?" shouted Mr. Brown, almost burst- ing with rage. "Whose fault is it, I should like to know? If it had not been for that inter- meddling hussy, your wife   " He was interrupted by a shrill scream, and the injured Mrs. Brown fell fainting to the floor. "If you will please inform me what has hap- pened," said Mr. Denys, recovering his usual calmness, "I would be extremely grateful." "Ask your meek-faced daughter there?" thundered Mr. Brown. Mr. Denys glanced towards Ida inquiring-   THE LAST OF HS NAME.  ly. "I know nothing about it, papa," replied she earnestly. "What and that little Swedish girl and you sleeping in the same room I" said Mr. Brown triumphantly. "Ebba did not sleep in my apartment last night," replied Ida, calmly, "she preferred sleep- ing in the little closet adjoining. She will be down stairs presently." "Yes, she will undoubtedly; but please read that note, Mr. Denys, and then you will be en- lightened." He extended a folded slip of paper towards Mr. Denys, who read aloud as follows: "Forgive me, my dear parents, I could not obey you. My heart forbade it. When next you see me, I shall be wedded to Ebba Justina. "FREDERICK."   "When next he sees me! " said Mr. Brown, sneeringly, " he shall never see me again. To fall in love with that little wax doll, with white hair and blue eyes.  She shall be no daughter of mine. I want no foundlings around me!" "Sir I" exclaimed Otto, aroused fron the stupor of astonishment into which the sudden news had thrown him, "Miss Justina is as pure as the unsullied snow.  She is worthy the hand of any man. If your son should prove as good a husband to her as she will be a faithful wife, you may well congratulate him."  "What I" exclaimed Mrs. Brown, suddenly recovering her senses, "do you, her betrothed, speak thus ?" "I loved her with a brother's love only,"  838    THE LAST OF HS NAME, said Otto, blushing deeply, " but had she not loved another, I would not have deserted her." "No matter what you would or would not havendone," said Mrs. Black. "Our only re- source now is to pursue the fugitives, and pre- vent the marriage if possible. Frederick is not yet of age, and should we overtake them, his father can, as his legal guardian, cause his arrest." "Would you do this thing, Mr. Brown?" in- quired Mr. Dehys, shocked at the cruel proposal. "I would," replied the incensed father firm- ly. "Yes, I shall scour the country immediately. I trust, Mr. Denys, that you will order your servant to harness my horses instantly. It may not yet be too late."' "You will not be obliged to seek far," said Mrs. Denys, who was standing near the window,   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     339 "for if my eyes deceive me not, the wilful couple are returning. Perhaps Master Frederick has changed his mind." Mrs. Brown suddenly arose from the sofa and rushed towards the window, and discovered an open carriage uapproaching. In a few mo- ments it stopped before the- door yard, and Frederick assisted his fair companion to alight. The youthful couple hastily entered the parlor, and cast themselves upon their kness before the angry father. "Now, Mr. Brown," said     Mr., Denys, warmly, "you see you have been fairly check- mated by the children. Own yourself beaten and forgive them." And Mr. and Mrs. Black, perceiving that there was no- longer any hope    that their cherished scheme could be carried to a suc-   340    THE LAST OF HS NAME. * cessful issue, and wishing to save themselves from future reproaches, united with their hosts in the endeavor to conciliate the disappointed parents. 'Mrs. Brown's affectionate heart could not hold anger against her only son, and at once casting aside her pride, she warmly em- braced him, and greeted Ebba as her daughter. Her husband could no longer remain at enmity with his boy; but with tearful eyes, he not only forgave him but also asked forgiveness in re- turn. Thus peace was restored, and the turmoil of the morning, which had threatened to destroy the happiness of two youthful hearts, subsided into peaceful joy. Mr. Brown gazed upon his beautiful daughter-in-law, and could not but be proud of his son's choice. "You were right, young   sir," said he, advancing to Otto. "She is a jewel fit for   THE LAST OF HS NAME.    341 any man to wear. We, I trust, shall be friends." Otto silently grasped the extended hand. Ebba, leaving the side of her young husband, timidly advanced to Otto. "Will you forgive me?" whispered she gently. "Forgive you, Ebba? I have nothingto for- give; on the contrary, from the bottom of my heart I wish you all happiness." "Did you not love 'me then?" inquired Ebba, with an air of astonishment. "Yes, Ebba, as your brother, and as my dearest sister I shall continue to cherish you. But I must reproach you a little, however, for not confiding in me." "Oh,-Otto, I thought-- " ' "Of the pale warners, Ebba, did you not? . .   342    THE LAST OF HS NAME. but go now to Miss Denys, she is longing to embrace you." "Mr. Denys, I trust will pardon my hasty words," said Mr. Brown, advancing to his host. "I could not forgive myself; but my present joy prevents the remembrance of my former anger." "No more words now, friend Brown, but let us to action. I have, I think, a bottle of wine left. Will you and Mr. Black join me in a glass to the honor which has this day been conferred upon my house?" The proposal was accepted with eager joy, and the health of the young couple was drunk time and again, until Mr. Denys deemed it expe- dient to produce a second bottle. During their walk the previous afternoon, Frederick had avowed his love to Ebba, and she   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     848' could not forbear acknowledging the sentiments of her own heart. .Both Ebba and Frederick possessed romantic and sentimental dispositions, and when he urged an immediate elopement, as the only means whereby they might be united, she, after a slight hesitation, consented, although her conscience smote her sorely for thus basely deserting her faithful Otto. They had so well arranged their plot, that after the family had retired for the night, they stole unobserved from the house, and proceeded to the village, where, in the morning, they were married by a clergy- man, whose suspicions Frederick silenced by a well-filled purse.  Frederick was too familiar with his parents' frailness of purpose, and their indulgent love for himself, to fear the result of his return.  Therefore as soon as the ceremony was performed, the youthful couple hastened to   344    THE LAST OF HS N AMF. the farm, both feeling assured that now, as the deed was fairly accomplished without remedy, their friends would, in due time, receive them as before.

At Blommaholme, once so bright and beautiful, all things are dreary and empty except our owk  earts; but this letter is written in the prayerful hope that this gloom may pass away from our lovely isle, and joy once more resume its reign. The fields once blooming in abundance are now overgrown with rank grass and weeds. The Iflowers in the garden are choked with thistles, and the mansion itself bears a deserted appearance. The parlors have been closely locked since your departure, Mr. -de Garcia having forbidden them to be opened. He resides in his room, which he now rarely leaves, for since Otto's absence he seems to take delight in nothing save solitude. His hairs are now silver white; hi s- form is stooped,    THE LAST OF?

When he beheld thewriting of your wife, the fierce battle between his pride and his affection plainly evinced itself upon his countenance; but, the former triumphed. He refused to read t]e letter, and ,commanded us to speak no more concerning it to him. If you will deign to listen to our advice, come back to him. The sight of his daughter will work a change that letters have failed toeffect. He loves you both with all the fervor of a father's heart.

"We have concluded, Ida," said her mother, "to yiit the home of my girlhood. Do you wish to acd company us, or would you prefer to spend a few months with Mrs. Black, in the city, until our return?" "Oh, take me with you," exclaimed Ida joy- fully. "I wish so much to behold that land which Otto has so often described to me. Ah, I know you will permit me to go." "Otto is to go with us," said Mr. Penys; "this letter from his parents has decided us to go at once."'    350    tHNE LAST OF HS NAME. "I will run and tell him? the good news," said Ida gleefully, and hastened from the room. "Oh, Otto," said she, almost breathless with joyful excitement, as she entered the parlor, where Otto was seated examining a large folio of engravings. I have news, such- news "' "What is it?" inquired Otto, catching her enthusiasm, "quick, tell me, for I see in your eyes that it is something joyful." "We are going to Blommaholme, you and I and papa and mamma! There--is not that great news?" "To Blommaholme?" exclaimed Otto, his eyes sparkling with delight.. "Yes, we have received a letter from your father and '- " letter l" interrupted Otto, "I must see   THE LAST OP HtS NAME;.    51  it," and without awaiting Ida's reply, he hastily proceeded to Mr. Denys's apartment. The- news of the intended journey soon spread throughout the house. Mr. Denys at, once informed his guests that a letter from his wife's former home had compelled him to make speedy preparation for an immediate journey; and Ida, after she had been so suddenly deserted by Otto, proceeded to the kitchen and told the great news to Lisbeth and Romulus, Who con- . sulted with each other as to the probability of their being allowed to accompany the family. "For my part," said -Mrs. Lisbeth, "I am of opinion that Mr. Denys will at letst consent to my going, for I was born, christened, married, and made a widow beneath the roof of the de Garcias, and even if Mr. de- Garcia was angry with me when I left his house, I think that he will   3$^    To JLAsT OFr nIp NAX. rseiv. me with joy; for I assure you, Mr. Ro- mulus, that I once had great influence with him.

The poor old man would mourn himself to death during our absence." "Oh," replied her mistress, "my husband cannot dispense with his services. Go, Lisbeth, and bid him prepare to accompany us." The following Thursday, the family at Red Creek farm, accompanied by their guests, com- menced their journey to the city, from whence they were-to take passage for Sweden. -  I  .  I    C HAPTERR XXVI. THE ARRIVAL.  IT was i wintry day. Blommaholme was clothed in a mantle of white, and the bay was firmly encased in icy armor. The snow; falling in thick flakes, was driven before the wind upon the smooth surface of the ice in a thousand fan- tastic eddies and circles, filling the atmosphere with a fine and blinding haze. , The air was cold to keenness; and the creaking of a large covered sleigh drawn by four powerful horses, as it pro- ceeded over the ice towards the little wharf, could be distinctly heard. The sleigh arrived at the dock, and six individuals, so closely en-   856    THE LAST OF HS NAME. veloped in furs that they could not be recog- nised, dismounted from the vehicle and hastily ascended the long flight of stairs. They arrived at the door of the fisherman's cottage, and knocked loudly. The door was opened, and the intruders were admitted.

They proceeded to-the mansion, and Ida and her mother entered the hall, while her father remained beneath the porch. As Blanche once more found herself beneath the roof of the home of her childhood, her heart beat with sentiments of mingled joy and fear. Here she had heard the dyingI words of her mother commanding her to console and obey her father, and from hence she was sent by an angry father for the crime of dis- obedience. As she approached the door of her father's apartment, her heart was oppressed with a fear so terrible, that her trembling limbs nearly refused to sustain her weight. "Go to him, Ida; I cannot, I dare not see my, father. -Go, dearest child, go, 'and entreat him to receive his daughter your mother."   THE LAST OF HS N'AME.     859 The color mounted to Ida's cheeks; her eyes sparkled with animation and courage; but as---d she tapped timidly upon the. door, thie bloom vanished, yet her eyes lost none of their bril- liancy. "Come in, Greta," said a voice from the inte- ' rior of the apartment, "I have been waiting for you."  Ida opened the door, and leaving it ajar that her mother might hear -the result of the inter- view, she' entered the room.  Mr. de G0arcia, clothed' in a loose dressing-gown, -was seated near the table, perusing .a closely written paper. Ida approached him with gentle footsteps. He turned his eyes upon her. "Blanche! my daughter!" exclaimed he, springing to his feet; then striking the palm of his hand against his forehead he sank back in his o    'T1I LA4T QF IS NA4ME.         chair, and covered his face with both hands. Through his fingers streamed tears, which Ida, kneeling at his feet, kissed away. "P:e, grandpa," whispered he, "forgive my mother." "Your mother, child!" exclaimed the old man, removing his hands from his eyes. "Let me look upon    you again.   Are you not ]}anqce?  Are you not, my daughter?  Yet you have her sweet face, her hair, her eye, her lip; let me kiss you    oId. What is your *e? re        yu q ,pi Qpi,? BQ#p, l    my daughter, am I dreaming?'"

What did you say, child?" "My mother, my mother," sobbed Ida, and placing her head upon his knees she wept with wild vehemence.   Blanche could no longer listen, but hastily entered the room. "Father, father," cried  she, "we have come to you again. Do not turn away from us." "It is Blanche. Oh, my Blanche, last night  I dreamed that I was with your mother. She bade me send for you, and I was about to obey her, when like an angel of mercy you have come to me. I am your father still. Forgive me, Blanche, forgive me." Blanche placed her arms around the old man's neck, and kissed away the tears that streamed from his eyes. Ida arose and hatened  862   'THE LAST OF HS NAME. to the door, and soon Edmund Denys and his daughter stood before de Garcia. "Here is my hand, my son," said de Garcia, his voice choked with emotion, we have much to pardon each other.?' Mr. Denys clasped the proffered hand, and placing Ida's soft hand with- in it, he said, "My daughter Ida must thank you. Go to your grandpa, child." "How like her mother!" said de Garcia strok- ing Ida's hair. "Kiss me, Ida. we shall be friends. Otto here 'I' exclaimed he quickly, as Otto sud- denly entered the room. "Oh, this is too much happiness for one day. This very evening you must tell me all." Otto, unable to restrain his impatient and i anxious longings to know the result of the inter- view, had hastily followed them to the house, and arrived in season to complete the happi-   THE LAST OF EIS NAMES.    86 ness of that eventful hour. We shall not at- tempt to describe the m-eeting between Mrs. Lis- beth and her old master, nor her grave introduc- tion of Romulus to him; but we will say that she returned from the first interview in the firm de- termination never again to desert the house of the de Garcias. She summoned Greta to her assistance, and at once proceeded to put the house in order. The parlors were thrown open, the furniture was dusted, and fires were kindled. As in times long past, she assumed the superin- tendence of the kitchen; and assisted by Greta, she  busied herself in preparing dinner, while Klas Hans and Romulus silently smoked their pipes behind the huge earthen stove.

Mrs. Lisbeth had prepared a huge bowl of punch, which was placed upon the table; glasses were filled: and toasts befitting the happy occasion were drunk amidst loud andjoyful exclamations. After the punch pas ren oved, de Garcia pro- posed a game of whist, challenging his daughter and her husband to play against himself and Lisbeth. Romulus concluded that he would find himself more comfortable in the kitchen, and immediaevly returned thither, where he was fol- lowed by, Klas Hans and Greta, whose curiosity had been excited in the highest degree by his novel appearance.

CONCLUSION. IN the peaceful enjoyment of their restored home, the family at Blommaholme spent the winter. Spring arrived, and the glad sun once more shone upon bright flowers in the garden. The icy. fetters of the bay had been shaken off; the bright blue waves danced in the sunlight;, and the little yacht reposed at the dock, newly painted, and decorated as gayly as when it first visited the island upon Greta's wedding day. The fields of the farm were in a state of cultiva- tion,' promising once more to yield an abundant crop, and the whole- island was filled with busy   THE LAST OF HS NAME.     367 activity. The evil spirits of Retribution Isle had spread their dark wings and disappeared for ever. It had been decided that Edmund Denys should proceed to America, alone, and after he had dis- posed of his property then he should return, and thereafter make Blommaholme his home. Ac- i cordingly as soon as the ice had disappeared from the bay he had taken his departure, and his return was daily expected. In the latter part of the first summer month, Mr. Denys, ac- companied by his sister Mary, once more received a cordial welcome at Blommaholme. He had sold'Red Creek Farm to Mr. Brown, as a resi- dence for Mr. Frederick Brown and his young wife; and Ida was rejoiced when her father in- I ' formed her, that Frederick had subsided from a frivolous fop into a sober farmer; and that Ebba' was a happy and contented wife.     THE LAST OF HS NAME.    369 Peace and joy were allotted to Edmund Denys and his wife. In the happiness of their children they found their greatest delight, and their bliss was rendered complete by the appearance of a little stranger in their midst, who rejoiced in the name of Rodolph Garcia Kuller. Kla% Hans and Greta continued to occupy their little cottage, proud of their son and happy in his joy. Mrs. Lisbeth and Romulus still conversed pleasantly together in the kitchen, the one smok- ing his pipe, the other using her snuffbox, and the only pain that the old lady ever experienced was when she thought of the impossibility of her ever being able to dance at her second'wedding,' and when she vainly wished that her companion had been born w'ith a different complexion.
