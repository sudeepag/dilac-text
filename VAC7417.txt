E. B. BROWNING. "Wasteful, forth Walks the dire power of pestont disease," THOMPSON. A DECEMBER landscape.   The soil rough and broken with rocks; with hillsides bare and brown; whilst heavy snow-drifts lay piled. up in the hollows. Between hills which were almost mountains, wound a highway, whose snow was beaten smooth and 'icy by much travel, and now glistened in the mock shining of an afternoons sun in mid-winter. A winding, troubling sort of highway, taking its sinu- ous course in dazed perplexity, as if having lost itself; and continually bringing the traveller. in sore trouble to the foot of an obstructing hill, which seemed its ter- minus; then suddenly revealing an unlooked-for open- ing. A road without any prospect; the half-grey, half- (7)   $8        .ONOR BRIGHT. snowy barriers on either side, sullenly shutting out all the world, and looming up toward heaven, as if striving to exclude even its narrow strip of cold bright-blue. In sombre contrast with its glittering whiteness, was a procession of scarce a dozen persons, clad in the habili- ments of woe, coming with slow, solemn tread, by two and by two, whilst four men in the van bore on their shoul- ders a cofin, covered with a pall. On, and on, through the moving, serpentine course of the road, ever at the foot of the mighty hills, with no sound save the dull, heavy tread of the four men with their burden, as they crushed the snow under their boots. No sob from the mourners, A strange procession; all men, and well-grown boys, with the exception of two -an old woman and a girl. Evi- dently the deceased had fallen in the lowly walks of life, for the followers were meanly clad, saving two, who brought up the rear. The elder a man of fifty, or there- abouts; the other not five years younger, and each wrapped in great coat and fur mufflers, to their very eyes. A mile and a half; then on one side the hills' fell gradually away; first in gentle rolls and snowy undula- tions ;then spread out into a wide stretch of landscape, bounded on one side by the horizon; on the other, by a continuous range of hills.    i In the distance of yet half a mile, rose the roofs and, spires of a town. The procession slowly approached it, but came to a sudden halt on its outermost suburb, where lay enclosed a 'small burying-ground; an ill-kept place, with no Old Mortality to tend its sunken, time-stained stones. The gate was blocked by a snow-drift. Two of the men cleared it away with their boots and arms, by turns, while the four who had led, shifted their heavy load a little uneasily on their shoulders, A   HONOR BRIGHT.          9 When at length the passage was cleared, they followed a well-beaten track through the snow, to where lay sev- eral new-made graves, over whose unsightly shape God had pityingly dropped his mantle of snow. Man had shown them less favor, for there was no sign of-even simple, rude board, to mark the head from the foot. Among them was one open, at whose side they laid their burden down, whilst the little company gathered about. There was no priest or minister; no hymn; no prayer; no mention of the God who had given and taken, or of the dear Christ, who, God-like, had broken the bonds of death, and, rising from its dread depths, dispelled the ter- ror and gloom' of the grave. There was no story of the cross; no repeating the blessed assurance, "I am the res- wrection and the life; " nothing to tell of a burial in a Christian land; only these words- spoken in a careless, rapid tone, by the elder of the two gentlemen we have described:    I "John Murray, aged twenty years and five months died of spotted fever." Then, as the coffin was lowered into the ground, and the first spadeful of earth fell with dull, despairing sound upon it, he added hurriedly, "Dust to dust and ashes to ashes."  Then turned abruptly, as if the sound was hateful to him, and led the way to the gate. All fol- lowed him save three -the man 'with the spade, the woman, and the girl. The elder seemed trying to per- suade the other to come with her; at length she gave over the effort, and started at' a quick pace after the others, overtaking them in the distance. The two who were left, for a long time exchanged no words. The man slowly filling in the grave, a spadeful at a time; the girl watching his work with a despairing expression, pitiful in one of her years. At length the   10        HONOR BRIGHT. man spoke in a tone half of bitterness, half of kindly concern, "Go home, Charity. The wind is cutting; your shawl is no better than a rag for warmth. Go home at once, or you will be the next." "I wouldn't care if I was. I am envious at each one," with a daring sort of hopelessness. "It comes soon enough without courting," he said sternly, resting on his spade to look at her. "Its very inevitableness makes me wish it. Its cer- tainty, sooner or later, fills every moment with horror. Better meet it instantly, than live in constant dread. I wish you were heaping the earth on me this instant," looking from the man's face down into the half-filled grave. "I would never do that, Charity. I would sooner spring in after you, and let them bury us together," with a voice broken and unsteady, and looking at her with a strange mixture of angry defiance and adoration, as if he dare fight either life or death for her. The girl made no reply, only wrapped her shawl more closely about her, as the wind blew a fierce blast, drifting the snow from the over-bending trees in her face. The man noticed it and said earnestly,-  "Go home, Charity, to please me, and stop fretting about all this. When it comes to the worst,"--and he pointed to the grave which now was almost filled, --" like John Murray, we are done with it." "Ralph, do you believe that?" eagerly, and drawing nearer to him. For an instant he was silent, evading her glance; then looking her full in the face, said vehe- mently, - "No! every noble instinct rises in rebellion at the thought; annihilation! a man no better than a brute!   HONOR BRIGHT.          11   I The very men who taught it disclaimed it on their death- beds, and there is Selden who -has always scoffed at the fear of death, and vaunted his right 'to live while he lived,' runs like a miserable coward at the first sight of the enemy." "What do you believe, Ralph," eagerly. "Nothing, absolutely nothing." There was silence then while he put in the last spade- ful and trod it down with his heavy boots, his face dis- closing deep thought the while. When his task was com- pleted he again rested upon his spade, and looking into her earnest, expectant face, said,-     . "Charity, there is a hereafter! the soul is immortal? I know! I feel there is something to fill this void, to meet this want. Voltaire, Tom Paine, and all the others, admitted it on their death-beds. The very belief we have been taught to scoff at from our childhood, is, I am convinced, the true one, and the whole of this belief I in- tend to know before I sleep this night." There was a quiet determination in his tone that had a certain grandeur. "How, Ralph?" wonderingly. "I shall go to one of these very ministers we have been wont to term  ranting hypocrites, and miserable, sneeking, white-livered cowards, fabricating idle tales and superstitions; then pretending that their belief in the same robbed death of its terror. They are not idle tales, neither their narrators the cowards we have fancied. One has been brave enough to seek us, when the very air of our dwelling was heavy and obnoxious with death, and met with only insults for his noble self-renuncia- tion. I shall seek him to-night, and know the ground of his indomitable courage, and sure, strong hope.'"   12       HONOR BRIGHT. She was watching him, her face full of admiration at his daring. "And how, Charity, go home, I would go with you, only for this. Besides, Tom will not live until morning. I have his measure with me, and mist leave it at the undertaker's." She shuddered, making no move to go. He threw down his spade, and came to her side. "Charity, pray go home; you are as white as death. Don't fret so, child. The fever is abating; there has not been a new case for nigh a week," encouragingly. "Ralph, it seems cruel to leave poor John. I heard Mr. Hammond tell that lawyer on the way here, that the doctors wanted the poor fellow. They thought him a fine subject. O Ralph!" and she shuddered, drawing close to him, and clasping her hands nervously on his arm. He seemed to understand and define her thought, so took them both in his, and said, in a low tone of mingled love- and strength, - "Dear love, do not think of such things. If it did come, such woe, I would never leave you, but would even dare live without you, long enough to watch until all danger was over." Then added lightly, "But what is the use to borrow trouble; we have enough without draw- ing on that most obliging of creditors," and stooping, he kissed her; then making her promise to go home at once, left her, taking his way to the adjoining town. The girl watched him until he was out of sight, lost in a bend of the road; then stood silently regarding the new- made grave for some minutes. She seemed troubled and pondering; at length a thought struck her. She seized the spade he had thrown down, and covered the grave with snow, until it was not distinguishable from the others;   HONOR BRIGHT.         13 then, having finished her work, threw the spade where he had left it, and turned toward the gate. A travelling carriage was coming slowly up the road; when opposite the grave-yardqit stopped. As she came within hearing distance the window was let down, and a gentleman leaned out, asking in a rich, clear voice, - "Can you direct me to to ' Bright Institute? '" She came outside the gate before she replied,- "It is about two miles from here, sir, right out the highway, but " - and she hesitated a moment ;. then con- tinued in a tone of blended wonder and inquiry, - "Are you a stranger in these parts, that you ask di- rection there now?" "Why not now?" a little astonished. "You do not know? why, the plague is raging there --see--" and she pointed with her hand to where lay the new-made graves. "Mark, let us turn back at once; the very air -may be' infected!" said an agitated voice from within the car- riage. The gentleman gave no heed, but continued his questions. "What is the plague? How long has it been raging? I should have been apprised of this," the latter clause in a tone of suppressed indignation. ; I wonder much, sir, that you have not heard of it in your journey. They call it spotted fever; it is three weeks full since it first broke out; but is abating now." "Have many died?" Again she pointed to the new-made graves for reply. "How many of them?" glancing in the assigned direco tion. "All without stones," bitterly.   HONOR BRIGHT.  He was quiet an instant, counting; then exclaimed in a tone of wonder, - "Thirty-five! is it possible?" "' Mark, for God's sake turn back!" cried the nervous, terrified voice within. "You can return, Clare; I am going on," was the de- cided reply, and as he spoke he opened the door and sprang out. As he did so, the girl caught a glimpse of the owner of the voice. A handsome, delicate face, but with figure deformed. "Mark, it is fool-hardy," and the face was thrust in the window, where the other had been a minute before. It is tempting Providence," in an argumentative tone. "I would have little reverence for a Providence, not abovo temptation from its own creatures," was the con- temptuous reply, as he closed the carriage door securely. The young girl, who had been silent and indifferent during this parlance, looked into the gentleman's face eagerly at that, with a little flush of admiration at his daring and determination. She gloried in a spirit that would not be baffled or affrighted from its object in view, even by death. "Drive into town," he directed to the coachman, an elderly man in livery, who had been giving the most wrapped attention all this time. Then he turned to the young girl and said,- "Can you tell me the name of the best hotel?" "I cannot; I know but little of the town," was the reply. He gave one or two, directions to the driver; then said to the gentleman within,- "Make yourself comfortable, Clare; I will find you some time between now and midnight." "You'll rue this dare-devil spirit yet, Mark," was the     impatient retort, as the carriage turned and rolled toward the town. The gentleman watched them in silence until lost in the bend of the road; then turning again to the girl asked, - "And now may I trouble you further'to direct my way?" "I live there, and will show you." "I thought as much," laconically. They followed the highway in perfect silence; when they had walked about a mile, he asked,- "Is there no short cut?" "Yes; through the hollow." They had reached that part of the road where the hills enclosed it. She stopped in their onward course, and turning to the right, led the way up the first gentle slope of the hill, and commenced descending an abript declivity on its hither side. He followed in silence. A deep, narrow ravine, or mountain gorge, lay beneath them, whose sides were rough and broken, whose bottom was a bleak, untrodden waste of snow. He stopped suddenly, saying in an amused tone, "I could never before discover any sense in that old adage, 'the longest way round, is the shortest way home.' We had better have kept to the road," taking in the prospects. "We can go back, if you are afraid of it," with a bit of contempt in the curve of her lip. She was disap- pointed in him. "I was not thinking of myself, but of you," with a cer- tain truthful sort of grace, that commanded acceptance. "Thank you, I am used to rough roads," was the reply, with a bitterness in the tone, which, to the keen observer of human nature beside her, gave an   16       EHONOR BRIGHT. instant insight into her life, and discovered to him the double significance to her words. He had scarcely looked at her before; had felt consider- ation only on the score of her womanhood; now he brought his eyes - clear, cool and searching - to bear full upon her. The face was familiar to him, yet it was not such a face as one would often meet in a day's walk. Where had he seen anything like it? it annoyed and perplexed him. The perfect oval contour; the broad, full brow, with bright-golden hair, swept in successive ripples from it; the lips, full- of mingled winsomeness and strength - he started, with a little flush of pleasure. It was the duplicate of Beatrice, only that the eyes were dark and intense. Now there were heavy rings under them, and not even the cutting wind had brought one tint of color to her cheeks; on the contrary, they were pale and hollow, and there were tense lines about eye and lip, that told how every nerve had been strained to its utmost. Withal, the face wore a restless, bitter, despair- ing expression, pityful to see even in age, but peculiarly so in youth. That sorrowful look of " tedium vitle." She seemed utterly unconscious of the keen eyes study- ing her; was looking straight before, and descending the precipitous bluff with light, agile step. Once the snow gave way beneath her foot; she slipped, and would have fallen, had he not caught her. After that he kept her hand, assisting her over the. roughest places, with a certain elegant grace peculiar to him. It was something new to the girl, and brought a sudden dash of color to her cheeks, that faded as soon as flushed. Her hand was ungloved and cold; his warm and in soft, rich kids.' Hter apparel of the very meanest - dark calico, with thin, faded black shawl; he in broadcloth and fur. She realized the contrast, and it gave a certain tone of *    NONOR BRIGHT.          17 dignity to the quiet, "Thank you, sir, kindly." When they had reached the hollow, and he released her hand, he apparently did not recognize the difference; in truth, seemed to forget her presence, when all occasion for assistance was over, looking straight ahead, with a preoccupied air. They followed the ravine a full half- mile before the silence was again broken; then it was with a question respecting the plague. "How many patients have they now?" "Five, if Tom is not already dead," she replied in a tone so still and passionless, as to seem almost heart- less. "Will the other four recover?" "Yes," laconically. "Have they had good care?" "We have nursed them," increasing her pace, as if the question had made her anxious as to her needed assistance. But he had no mind to go more rapidly, and with a quiet determination and force of will, that she felt and yielded to, though unexpressed, he moderated her step.  "Who are the we? ' still questioningly. "Old Reliable, Ralph, and I. Some of the others too, though the most have run away, and those left are too much -frightened to help," passively answering every question put. "Why, where is Selden, the Principal?" The girl's eyes flashed; her lip curled in disdain: "He was the very first to desert. For all his scoffing at death, he proved a coward. We have never seen him since the first death." There was an expression of contempt on the man's face. He was silent an instant, then continued,- "Is Mr. Hammond there?" !  :    2           , 2   18        HONOR BRIGHT. "Yes, sir, besides another gentleman-a lawyer -who came about a week since." C Ah!" in a better satisfied tone. After that, another long stretch in silence; then a sud- den curve in the ravine brought the wind, fierce and cruel, full in their faces. - The gentleman raised his hand to protect his hat, whilst the girl wrapped her- thin shawl the closer about her, and set her lips firmly, to keep back the shiver. He saw it, and looked at her in his keen, searching way again. Here was a new phase of character; an individuality; a girl meanly and thinly clad, either too proud to show that she was cold, or too much of a stoic to admit that she suffered. He was interested. Was she as truthful as stoical. He would try her. "You are cold," in a tone of inquiry. "Yes," curtly, and setting her lips again. A bit of a smile played about eye and mouth. She was looking straight before. He unbuttoned the fur collar from his throat, and threw it lightly about her shoulders. The blood surged to her very temples; she began vehemently, - "You must not, sir! Indeed, you must not! I can- not-" But he laid his hand lightly, though  detainingly on her shoulder, whilst he fastened the button in the loop, and then, with quiet determination, put the subject to one side. The color soon died, but the face wore another ex- pression. A look of mingled gratitude and wonder. It was but a little act, yet it changed the current of the girl's life. She had grown up to regard the rich with hatred and distrust; looking on them as all selfishness, but now, from a stranger, she had received a kindness.   HONOR BRIGHT.          19 "' What sort of a spirit have you? Indian, or Spar- tan?" he asked. "Neither. It is neither the proud, indomitable spirit of the Indian, nor the noble, unflinching courage of {the Spartan. It is simply dumb endurance." She had begun in a tone of passionate disclaim, but ended in a sort of withering contempt at herself. Here, indeed, was an anomaly; a girl in calico, bracing herself with heroic stoicism against winter winds, and analyz- ing the inward impulse that led to the outward manifes- tation. Then, too, with a knowledge of the national characteristics to which he had likened her, with a lofty pride, that would not brook undeserved praise, disclaim- ing the comparison.  Oh, strange incongruity! It was little wonder the man scanned her face with a still keener eye. Yet in a certain measure, allowing of course for indi- vidualities, she was a fair type of the institute they were approaching. The brain nourished, clothed, fed--the soul, heart, body, neglected and starved, whilst their cravings and demands were scoffed at and mocked. Then another curve in the ravine, and there, immedi- ately above them, on the very summit of an overhanging bluff, towered the Bright Institute, a grand, imposing edifice of grey granite. A strange building, too, it was, with three massive turrets, the centre higher than the other two; the rest, spreading in low, irregular, rambling fashion, with many sharp angles, whilst its southern side was covered with ivy, a wall of living green. It had an appearance of staunch, proud old age seldom seen in buildings in this country. Clinging to the very verge of the precipitous declivity, it had weathered many a gale, and breasted storms for more than a century; yet in all these years had neither priest or minister crossed its ;            '      20        HONOR BRIGHT. threshold, nor Holy Bible told its beautiful, divine truths within its walls. A massive, monumental pile to infidel- ity, looming in al sort of grim, sullen defiance against the winter sky. The gentleman stood mute with admiration. There was a flash of pride in the girl's face; it had been her home from earliest childhood. "A turreted castle, as I live! I thought myself in America, but suddenly am transported to the mountains of Switzerland, or the rugged castle-crowned bluffs of Northern Spain. There must be magic in it I By what art have you conjured up this frowning battlement? Enchantress, show thy wand! Repeat the incantations, I entreat you," he said lightly. There was a bit of a smile on the pale face as she led the way up the steep ascent by a sinuous flight of natural steps in the rock, saying in a tone that had a world of despair rmngled with its lightness,- "We don't even believe in magic here." Mrhen they reached the summit, she led him through what in summer was a lawn of velvet green, but now a level expanse of snow, around the side of the building to the main entrance. It was in the largest tower. A flight of broad, low, circular steps, guarded at their base by two crouching lions of the same granite, led into a vestibule deep and broad, with marble floor tiled in mosaic pattern, whilst two recesses, one on either side, were graced by marble statues of Justice and Liberty. The outer door stood open; the inner, of massive mahogany, rich and dark, the girl rolled aside, looking into his face as she did so, and saying, in a bitter tone,- "'Who enter here, leave hope behind."' Intuitively he drew  back, changing color as if smitten with some strong, unnatural foreboding. It was   HONOR BRIGHT.          21 but for an instant though, and recovering himself, he said gayly,- "I will break the enchantment, and prove the proph- etess a false one." Then followed her across the threshold. Again she stood still, to enjoy his wonder and admira- tion. He had travelled the world over; had been through the castles of Spain and Italy, yet was filled withq amaze. It was a grand hall--broad, deep, and domed, with massive pillars, supporting arches of won- drous workmanship. The floor was marble, and tiled in Oriental fashion. The walls and ceiling frescoed with finest paintings and designs, whilst marble figures, per- sonating the several passions of the human heart, such as love, hatred, virtue, crime, revenge, remorse, graced the niches. It was octagon in shape, and in each of its eight sides were marble pillars curiously carved, supporting arches of fretted work, beyond which were long corridors leading to the several portions of the building. In its centre, supported by eight snowy cherubs, with droop- ing wings and upturned faces, was a fountain, that had frozen in its play, whilst the water-drops hung in glitter- ing stalactites, catching the light, and reflecting it in brilliant, varying hues, as it fell through the stained glass over the main entrance.  Above one of the arches grander and more wondrously carved than the others, on an azure ground, were emblazoned in letters of gilt the two words, "Honor Bright." At   length the stranger's eye rested upon them; he glanced at the girl for explanation. "It was the name   of the foundress, and has since be- come the motto -  in fact, the religion - of our institute," she explained, with a mocking little laugh at that word i religion.   22'       HONOR BRIGHT. He drew back at the laugh; then again took in the brilliant, imposing effect. "It is some Moorish temple, of grand oriental splendor. It reminds one of the enchanted halls of the Alhambra. Does any sleeping nymph, or spell-bound naiad, guard yon fountain? Surely the hand of enchantment is upon it all. Such silence! such unnatural silence! Even the water-drops forbidden to play. Is thine the wand?" looking into her face half lightly, half earnestly. "It is no eastern temple; neither work of magic or incantation; but for all its gorgeous entrance, a mere gilded labyrinth of doubt and unbelief. Besides, sir, you view but the first cycle; never seek to peer into the ninth," in the sad, earnest tone of a Pythia. "Dante's inverted cone! I'll not believe it," bringing his eyes to bear full upon her face, his own wearing an expression of mingled surprise and inquiry. She was an anomaly to him. She caught the expression and smiled, a little, quiet, amused smile; then turned and led the way through one of the arches into a corridor, at whose first door she paused with one hand on the knob, whilst with the other she loosened the collar from her throat, and i handing it to him, said, - "You have given me-a pleasant thing to remember." Then, ere he could speak, added, - "You will find Mr. Hammond within," and, throwing wide the door, left him. The room into which he was thus unceremoniously ushered, was of half-circular shape, the curved side forming one of the large windows of the main tower. It was evidently a reception-room. Its architecture was in keeping with the hall; but its furniture, though of rich material, was worn, and faded to shabbiness. A bright fire burned upon the hearth, diffusing a genial warmth to   HONOR BIZHf T.          '23 the apartment, that was all the more grateful to the stranger, by contrast with the wintry wind he had been breasting, and the still more penetrating chill of the unheated hall. The gentlemen who assisted in the fune- ral rites we have described, sat, one on either side of the hearth, whilst a light-stand stood between them, holding decanters and glasses, from which they had been refresh- ing themselves. The opening of the door attracted their attention. They arose simultaneously, whilst the elder, who now, divested of greatcoat and fur muffler, proved a corpulent man in ruffled shirt; came forward, saying in a tone of surprise, "Mr. Mallory -- is it possible! when did you arrive? I am at a loss to know which emotion stirs me most, whether happiness or regret, to see you at this most un- auspicious moment," seizing the stranger's hand; then continuing with great volubility,- "Come to the fire, sir; you must be perished with your journey. Have a glass of wine, pray, and I will order a bit of cake, and some cold mutton, or salmon, or some- thing of that sort." The gentleman took the proffered .chair, but declined the hospitalities, glancing at the third party inquiringly as he did so. "Pray pardon the oversight I  Surprise deprived me of my wonted observance of etiquette. Mr. Mallory, per- mit me to make you acquainted with our most esteemed counsellor-at-law, and highly respected friend." The gentleman thus brought forward bowed low; after that they all re-seated themselves, and for a little there was an uncomfortable silence. The stranger slowly sip- ping a glass of wine; the other two looking alternately into the fire, and each other's faces, each evidently en- deavoring to shift on the other an unpleasant task.   24        HONOR BRIGHT. At length the elder, with a reproachful glance at the other, and martyr-like air, undertook the disagreeable revelation, beginning in a manner in which loquacity and embarrassment were most ludicrously blended. "My dear sir, I regret to be forced to make a most alarming and unpropitious disclosure to you. My dear sir, I sincerely deplore the fact that I am the unhappy instrument selected by fate to reveal this direful occa- sion. I had trusted this revelation had been averted, but--" The stranger interrupted him with a quiet smile. "I will spare you the explanation. Mr. Hammond, I have already been fully informed by one of your number, you are not in the least to blame, but why did not Selden apprise me of this? not that I have the slightest fear of the plague, but simply that I consider it was due one gentleman from another," the smile changing to a frown of displeasure as he continued. "Really, my dear sir, Selden is not accountable for anything. He has been as white as a ghost with fright ever since the first case. In fact, we have all been con- siderably flustrated, as our most esteemed friend and o counsellor-at-law can testify. You comprehend, my dear *sir, we were surprised and shocked; yes, absolutely shocked  why, I have been some frightened myself, -it's a fact," apologetically, and lovingly. stroking his heavy double chin, a habit he had. An expression of scorn flitted over the stranger's face, and waving the subject with a gesture of contempt, he inquired,- "Have there been any cases of this in the town, or surrounding country?" "None, sir; absolutely none; allow me to assure you that it has been entirely local,-entirely sir. It has not   HONOR BRIGHT.           25 passed these walls, sir, excepting to the grave-yard. I call our most esteemed friend and counsellor-at-law, to witness the veracity of my statement," spreading his large, fat hands on his knees, and glancing at the lawyer for confirmation of his words.    The lawyer corroborated them by several assenting nods. "Then you think my brother will be perfectly safe at the hotel, and my mother also, for I expect her shortly." "Indeed, I assuredly assure you, sir, that I would not for an instant pause for reflection as to the safety of the situation, and no man regards parental-or fraternal ties more entirely than your humble servant." "You have the papers prepared," with a shade of im- patience at the old gentleman's garrulity. The lawyer produced them; they were examined and signed; a little while after the gentleman arose, saying, - "Now, will you be so good as to   show me over the building?" CHAPTER II.

"All in their silent graves Deep to corrnption, Slowly down sinking I " [From the German of Stackmann.]      LONGFELLOW. BRIGHT  INSTITUTE was of  old and long standing, situated in the mountainous portion of one of our West- ern States - western, as we used the term long ago, but at the date of our story -  1859 - scarcely more than central.   26        HONOR BRIGHT. Its foundress was an aged, learned spinster. Bright was her parent's name, and she was called Honor. The InstituteS was a charitable one. Children were taken in childhood. - Their education was both practical and theoretical. The girls were fitted for teachers; the boys either for business or professions. When they arrived at the age of twenty-one, they were sent out into the world to take care of themselves. Its patroness had imbibed the. fallacious views of Voltaire, Hume, and the many other atheists of that period. It was founded on much the same principle as Girard College- namely, that neither priest nor minister should ever cross its threshold, or the sacred scriptures be read within its walls. So it stood in the midst of a Christian land, with church spires pointing heavenward full in view; with church bells filling the Sabbath air with their music - a mocking, defi- ant monument of infidelity. Yet there was nothing appertaining to it "that ad- mitted of its dissolution." It was highly moral and vir- tuous. Some of the best teachers and most learned pro- fessors in the State, had quaffed deep of the fountain of knowledge within its walls. It was essentially devoted to learning. The brain was educated, utterly at the ex- pense of heart and soul. Its cravings were encouraged by constant supply; its demands ever met; whilst every heart-throb and soul-longing were sneered and scoffed at, until with some the moral powers were dwarfed; with others, distorted and exaggerated by ill growth and mal- treatment. From very infancy, they were imbued with doubt and distrust of all things holy and true. Love, faith, immortality, were constant themes of ridicule. * The story of this Institute and the plague is a fact. f     ,   HONOR BRI   Yri'.       27 Heaven, a by-word; hell, a joke; and God - God pity them -they laughed and scoffed at the existence of their Creator, and said there was no God.  The earth --its in- habitants were creatures of chance, natural causes pro- ducing natural effects.  Geology alone proved their theory.            They were taught to hate vice, because of its evil conse- quences; to avoid dissipation of every order, because it was deleterious to the health of the body, and, above all, weakened the forces of the mind. They despised false- hood, because it was mean and contemptible. The reins of their passions were put in their hands; they were counselled to hold them tightly, and with firm grip, though the choice was left with themselves, and if any failed or slackened rein, so that passion mastered, the principle instilled in youth, " live while you live, for to-morrow you die," was his sufficient justification. The faculty made no effort to refute it, but passed over the fault in silence. Only one thing was impressed upon them, namely, that honor passed current the wide world over; that a, man of honor was, without exception, a successful and respected man.  Thus the name of its patroness passed  into a motto; and Honor Bright became their motive power of    r action; their platform from which to judge and estimate every subject; their highest standard; and as in every human heart there is some idolatrous impulse - a demand for something to worship -honor, to them, was deified,. and keeping it bright became their religion. But enough; we will let its disciples speak for themselves. When Charity left the stranger, she recrossed the grand hall, and passing through another archway, entered a long corridor, which,' broken by sundry little flights of steps and intersecting passages, ran through the eastern por- tion of the building There were doors on either side. '    '28.       HONOR BRIGHT. One of these, at its extreme end, she opened, and glanced in. It was a kitchen. A large stove gave a pleasant heat to the room. In the centre a supper-table was spread, in its appearance reminding one very forcibly of Crispa's per- tinent description, "Very little meat, and a great deal of table-cloth." "The less food the body had, the more the mind would crave," was one of the theories of the Insti- tute; in other words, ( Tenui musamn meditanus avena" ,-- IVe cultivate literature on a little oatmeal."' Twi- light was rapidly gaining on the day, and on either end of the table burned a lamp, causing the sickly, ghastly effect that the mingling of natural and artificial light al- ways produces. About a dozen persons were seated around the board-half-grown boys and girls, and a few who had reached early manhood and womanhood. Among them, the pall-bearers of the afternoon, and some who had composed the scant funeral procession. The faces for the most part were wan and pale, and on each was stamped an expression of dread and horror. They were conversing in low tones while they ate. As the girl opened the door, with one accord they glanced toward it, as if in expectation of something; then, seeing who it was, continued their meal, whilst one girl exclaimed,-- "You gave us such a start, Charity. We thought it was Old Reliable, to tell us Tom was dead." At that the young girl crossed the threshold, coming and standing by the table. One of the others was pre- paring a place for her, but she shook her head, saying she could not eat, and asking, - "Who is with him? Is he dying hard?" "Old Reliable and two of the boys. We could not bear to see it. It is dreadful, Charity," replied the first i4-   HONOR BRIGHT.          29 speaker, growing white as death, and trembling percep- tibly. The girl turned toward the door. "Where are you going, Charity?" called two or three after her in alarm.         i "There, of course," decidedly, pausing in the door- way. "You must not. It is no place for a woman. Old Reliable sent all the girls away,-" said one of the boys. She paid no heed, but went on. "That girl is perfectly immovable and stubborn. I wish Ralph was here; he is the only one in the world who can influence her," muttered the lad; but Charity did not hear him; she was going rapidly through one long hall after, another, and up winding stairways, until she reached a range of sleeping apartments, in an upper and remote portion of the building. Halls and chambers alike were icy, cold, and uncarpeted. The doors of the latter, with the exception of two or three, stood open. A rude bedstead and solitary chair constituted the entire furniture of each, whilst a centre one on either side of the passage appeared to be a washroom. At one of these closed doors the girl paused as if to recover and brace her- self for some thing dreaded; then, opening it, entered. The room was like the others, only a low fire burned in the open chimney. One lay upon the bed, fighting death. The old woman whom we saw il the grave-yard, bent over him, wiping the death-dew from his brow, while two young men stood, one on either side of the bed, with blanched faces, and strong frames bowed and shaken at the presence of the " king of terrors." The girl stole up to the bed-side. He was utterly prostrate, and seemed breathing his last. His face wore the ashy palor of death, save where deep-purple spots,   30        EONOR BRIGHT. like coagulated blood, stained brow, temple, and lip. He was silent, and so motionless, she thought him dead al- ready, and whispered so to one -of the watchers. He shook his head negatively for reply. A little space the silence of the grave reigned; then a low, sharp cry escaped the lips of the dying man--a cry that made the heart of the listener cease its pulsation, and the blood freeze in his veins; a cry of such utter hopelessness, such terrible despair--"Oh, I cannot die! I will not die! who says I am dying.? he is a liar; I will notf with wild, defiant eyes. "Cease to be! forever and ever! nothingness, void, annihilation! to sink into the im- measurable depth of chaos. It is not, oh! it is not true. I have been taught a lie from my childhood-a cursed lie," burying the wan, skeleton fingers in his hair, and tearing it out by the roots. Then, in a tone of fearful conviction: "There is an eternity! the soul is immor- tal! the grave does not compass all, I know, I feel, when alas, too late. Oh! for one week of life! one short week, or even an hour I I would know where to find this God whom my soul acknowledges. , Oh, life, life! in passionate yearning. Then, with fearful hatred and de- nunciation on his blood-stained lips: "If there is a AIell, may they be damned eternally to its lowest depths, who have filled my life with this cursed belief--belief!" with poignant sarcasm-- "'tis no belief, but a long, tor- menting, racking doubt. I die! I cannot breathe! I I sink! I plunge into the unfathomable abyss of dark- ness! Oh! save me! save me!"He started up, stretch- ing his long, gaunt arms imploringly toward those about the bed. A spasm convulsed the purple-stained face; with the supernatural strength of the last paroxysm, he sprang almost to his feet, then uttering a cry of pierc- ing, utter despair, sank lifeless. .   HONOR BRIGHT.          31 So a soul had plunged wildly into the Unknown, grop- ing its way blindly into the presence of its God. A dreadful stillness reigned, each mute and motionless with . horror; then, as drawn by some magnetic influence, the girl turned. At the foot-board, transfixed and pale, stood the stranger. An expression of bitter, almost exultant triumph, flashed across her face, and as the old woman, with the aid of the two young men, laid the body straight and stark upon the bed, she looked up into his face, and said, with a laugh that sounded strained and hysterical in its fierce hopelessness,-- "What! have you peered into the Ininth cycle,' so soon? who now is the true prophet?"    Then,ere he could for horror reply, lent hands, grown fearfully expert in this direful employ, composing the limbs of the dead man, and closing the glazed, despairing eyes. The stranger turned from the sight with a shudder, to where Mr. Hammond awaited him on the threshold. An hour later, the girl left the room where the dead man lay. From a hall casemegt, as she was passing, she saw, by the light of the new moon, Mr. Hammond's carriage at a lower door. She paused to watch the stranger step in, and the horses turn toward the distant town; then passed on again, retracing the winding stairs and long corridors until she reached the kitchen. Some time after, she re- crossed the grand hall we have described, dark now, save for one pendant lamp, and cold as a gilded vault. She passed through another of its eight fretted arches, and ascended a broad, grand stairway, that led into another hall above -one of its doors she opened and entered. The room could scarcely be called a .library. Its fur- niture was of the cheapest style; the carpet, rag, with the colors faded and shabby. There were rough, home-made benches standing about the room, and one or two tables,   32        HONOR BRIGHT. on which were stood unlighted lamps. There was not a book-case in the room, and yet it was essentially a room of books. Rows of rudely-constructed shelves, ranged around three of its sides, reaching from ceiling to floor, one compact mass of volumes, whilst on the fourth side was a wooden mantelpiece, bearing an old fashioned clock, and underneath it, on the hearth, burned a wood fire. Beside this sat the grave-digger: of the afternoon, in a stooping posture, poring over a little volume that he held close to his eyes. Very fine gray eyes they were, too, with a hungry, starving expression in them, that fairly devoured the open pages. Eyes that, for all their lustre, had been strained in every nerve, and whose sight was slowly failing, from long nights of reading by uncertain fire-light and flickering candles. He did not glance up when the girl entered, nor ap- parently was he aware of her presence until she stood be- side him, and laid her hand upon his shoulder; then the tense lines of thought on the broad brow relaxed; the eyes came to her face with the glad, softened light of love, and he said,- "Is it you, dear heart?" "Yes," in an absent sort of tone, and not looking at him, but standing with her hand still upon his shoulder,. gazing drearily into the fire. He watched her in silence for a little; then said anx- iously,- "What troubles you so, child?  The eyes came from the fire to his face. "Haven't you heard, Ralph?" in atone of amaze. "Heard what? I have heard nothing?" wonderingly. "Why, that the Institute is dissolved, Ralph! That the few of us left are homeless; that the buildings, the lands, all are sold."   HONOR BRIGHT.          33 He listened in dumb astonishment. "Why, Ralph, it is strange you have not been told; the rest all know it." "I have seen no one since I returned from town. I came right here. Who is the purchaser? tell me all you know?" a slight unsteadiness in the usually firm tone. "A gentleman who came here this afternoon,- I do not know his name. When I left the burying-ground, his carriage was at the gate. He asked direction here. There was another gentleman with him,-I saw him through the window,--a humpback, delicate and pen- sive, who, when I told them of the plague, seemed much alarmed, and refused to come any farther. But the other is a daring, fearless man; he ordered the carria/ge back to the hotel, and came on foot with me. He was closeted with Mr. Hammond and, that lawyer for some time; then Mr. Hammond sent him to town in his carriage, and af- terward told us. He had listened in silence. When she finished, he said, almost fiercely, "I am glad of it. Never was a better deed done than the breaking up of this cursed Institute. Its influence has been blighting, withering, damning, a upas in the midst of a land of beauty; a foul malaria in a pleasant country.  Its object has been to breed distrust of. all that is pure and holy, in young, trustful hearts; to feed hun- gry souls on error and send them to hell. Thank God, it is over; for that there is a God, I know and feel." Great drops of perspiration were rolling from his brow; his firm lips quivered with excess of feeling. The girl looked at him, her face flashing half with joy, half with admiration at his daring avowal. He caught the expression, and taking the hand resting on his shoulder fondly in his, said,- 3  34       HONOR BRIGHT. C"It is so, dear heart; you will believe it too. This plague that has seemed a curse, has proved a blessing in disguise. I have turned the cloud and found its lining; and, my darling it is better than silver,- it is gold, pure and tried." And as he spoke, he raised the little volume to where she could see printed in letters of gilt, -- Holy Bible." Her hands trembled with awe as he placed it in them. It was the first time she had ever touched, or her eye rested on that message from her Creator, and yet she had lived nineteen years in a Christian land. She opened and glanced through it, with a face white and eager; but she trembled so she would have dropped the book, had he not caught, not only it, but the hands too, - holding them in a- kind, strong way. "Charity, you are unstrung, overwrought. To-morrow, not now." And he laid it on the mantel beyond her reach.. She looked at it wistfully, but made no effort to take it, yielding not so much to- the stronger will, as to her own spent energies. Then there was silence, each in thought; he broke it, saying,- "When does the new owner take possession?" "As soon as the plague abates, and the building is considered safe," absently. "We will not wait until then; we will leave this cursed roof to-morrow," he said, vehemently. She looked at him in wonder. "I served my time out three years ago, when I was twenty-one. I would have left then, only that I could not tear myself from you, my darling. Since then I have earned a mere pittance; but from it have saved enough to afford a temporary home until I can secure employ- ment. It is over,--you shall not be exposed to this   HONOR BRIGHT.         35 fever another day. T had looked for two more years of bondage, until you were twenty-one. And now you are free, and wmine." He arose as he spoke, standing beside her, and putting his arm around her, drew her to him, with the mingled, tender, and triumphant air of posses- sion. She yielded passively, but after a little said, with a tinge of doubt in her tone,- "Ralph, you know I do not feel quite as you do." "You could not, dear heart. I do not expect it. But you love me some, Charity?" questioningly, and looking searchingly into the upturned face. "Yes, better far than any one living; life would be utterly desolate without you. I have always depended on you; you are my first and kindest recollection." "That is all I ask, dear love. I'll take the rest on trust," in a gay, confident tone; then adding passion- ately,- "To-morrow you will be mine, all mine; a part of my very self. You will begin even then to love me as I do you." ' She did not disclaim, but a shadow fell across the white, eager face. Joy is selfish. In his transport he did not see it, but passionately kissed her pale brow, and cold, unanswering lips. "To-morrow, Ralph?" in almost a whisper, trembling a little as with fear. "Yes, to-morrow," with joyous confidence. To-morrow! alas, like its twin, " by and by," it "is easily said."  To-morrow, with its joyous anticipation; with its glad promise of good things; with its hope of a new life of purity and truth; with its meetings of loved ones parted; with its feastings- and ev ellings; with its wedding bells and wedding cheer,  36        HONOR :3RIzGBT. "To-morrow never comes." It is like the "new leaf" that is 'never turned. Yet those two stood, that man and that woman, each utterly forgetting to-day, living in to-morrow. He with face suffused with a flush of joy; hers pale and clouded. At length she said good-night very softly. He kissed her, then released her. At the door she paused, and look-, ing back said,-- "You know Tom is dead, Ralph." "I knew he could not live until morning; when did he die?" "About an hour and a half ago," with a shudder at the recollection. "I will watch," he said, - then the door shut her from his view. For a little he stood like one in a pleasant dream; then rousing himself, took the little volume from the shelf and went out into the cold, dark hall. A few minutes after, he entered the room where the dead man lay stiff and stark, and all the long hours of the night- vigil, by the dim, low-burned candle, he poured over the "Word of Life." Lower and lower it burned to its very socket, flickered and went out. He folded his arms on the table that held it, and dropped his head wearily upon them. Darkness, silence. The living and the dead so near. There in the early morning twilight they found him with the fever on him.   HEONOR BRIGHT. CHTA PTER III. "Even as the blessed in the new covenant, Shall rise up quickened, each one from his grave, Wearing again the garments of the flesh." [From Dante.] LONGFELLOW.  "For thee was a house built . Ere thou wast born  For thee was a mould meant Ere thou of mother camest; "Doorless is that house, And dark it is within; There thou art fast detainedt And death hath the key." [From the Anglo-Saxon.]          LONGFELLOW. THE night was gone, and "To-morrow," the cruel, heartless cheat, from her place in "the Beyond," threw back her shattered promises, and mockingly pointed to "To-day." Verily was the place cursed!  Death had spread his wings above the gray old battlements of infidelity; had cast his shadow in at every casement; had crept through every chink and cranny; the foe had conquered; the fortress had fallen; the king of terrors reigned supreme. He had smitten down the young and fair in the pride of their youth and beauty; in his wrath had laid low    the strong man in the glory of his strength; and had claimed as his own, little ones who, in their prattling, had never learnt to lisp the dear name, Christ. Still there was another victim! Ah, insatiable Death! Long practice had made the weapon sure! The first shot took effect- he fell. There were a few hours of mortal agony; then the   38        HONOR BRIGHT. death-dew gathered on the broad, fine brow, and the eyes--those kind, deep) beautiful eyes-grew dim. There was no struggle, no cry of horror, no death agony. An expression of ineffable peace lighted up the dying face. He had learned of Jesus. To his astute, logical mind, the plan of salvation was lucid and complete, and, with characteristic firmness and decision, he had believed and accepted it. His last act was to put his Bible in the hands of the woman he loved; his last words, in a tone of strong trust, and pure, deep, rapturous love,- "My God and my Lord!" Another than death had penetrated the hitherto im- pregnable battlements, and within its grim, defiant walls, the cross was reared, whilst one, dying, had gone to the bosom of the pitying Christ. They had all ga'thered about the bedside, and stood in silent awe at this presence, this greater than death, even this conqueror of death. White, and cold, and dead, with such peace overspreading the pale, still face, and the glad, sure hope of the last heart-throb traced in every lineament. The stranger was at the bedside. H1is hand wiped the death-dew from the cold, damp brow. A hand kind and gentle as a woman's. The girl whose wedding day this was to have been, knelt near the head-board, like one in a stupor, as white, as motionless, as stony as a statue. The stranger looked at her in mute amaze. this individuality, ever disclosing some new phase of character. .  ' "They loved each other," whispered a young girl, her voice broken by emotion, by way of explanation to his questioning look. Then there was a Christian burial. No one knew for a certainty who had had the daring to infringe and   ZHO2NOR BRIGHT.         39 trample down the old laws, only it was whispered that; it was the work of the new owner. Surely, if he could brave disease and death, he would care little for manl? ire, or defunct laws. The building was his; he had pur- chased it from the State. Its former principles, to him, were obsolete. He was always there now. With the man- ner of one accustomed to, command, he had assumed the entire, control of everything within the building, each one rendering implicit, unquestioning obedience. They had buried Ralph that afternoon; now it was night, and they were gathered in the kitchen, this little, broken circle of orphans. Old Reliable was there too, sitting close by the fire, and sipping a cup of strong tea, that one of the girls had made to refresh her. She was wearied out from long, successive nights of watching. . She had nursed them all from their childhood - good, faithful Old Reliable. There was another expression on every face now. The look of horror and dread, that had marked each since that fearful plague had broken out, was gone. "I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth on ne, though he were dead, yet shall he live." These words over an open grave, and cold, still form, so full of promise, they had planted in some hearts a wild, panting joy; in others a quiet, satisfying hope; and in others still, a firm determination to know this "truth," that "maketh free."  There was a greater than death. There was life eternal! There was a God! He was their Creator, and oh! wonderful condescension, he loved them. They talked about it, and marvelled. Some few of the elder boys questioned it a little, saying they must search and reason for themselves, but the younger and more impressible, and the women, ever nearest God, took it all on trust. One dying, whom in life they had placed implicit confidence in, from the very border of the shad.   40        HONORK BRIGHT. owy land had borne glad, rapturous testimony to its truth. A God! a Saviour! eternal life! The soul fed at last! it was as much as the starving could bear'at once. Th ey accepted these three great facts, and were content. The horrors and terrors of the plague were for the moment forgotten; and thus, in a measure, its power was broken, for the very fear it had 'inspired had added to its invincibility, by weakening the forces of resistance, and laying their undermined systems entirely open to the inroads of the destroyer. To-night everything was hope- ful. The four remaining cases were convalescent. Three of them had that day sat up, and to each of them a faith- ful minister of God had related the wondrous story of the cross. Old Reliable was to sleep that night, the others gladly offering!to keep all needed watch. They spread the board for supper in an almost merry fashion, passing over the many vacant places in silence, talking all the while of these " glad tidings of good things," carefully avoiding every painful subject and reminiscence, speaking ever of life and not death. Then, too, they dilated on the kindness of the new owner-never mentioning the dissolution and breaking of ties that was sure to come and praising his almost prodigal liberality, for the table, now, was burdened with nourishing food, and even lux- uries, whilst every dainty that could tempt the most deli- cate palate, was provided for the convalescent. One of the girls said she had overheard the stranger remairk to the doctor, with a frown -that she would not have liked to encounter, that "it was exposure, and lack of proper food, which had produced the fever."' The doctor had nodded assentingly,. and replied that "that was Selden's fault." "You should have informed the State, and demanded reformation," had been the cutting retort. And the   HONOR BRIGHT.          41 narrator added, that "she wondered much, how one, who could be so very kind, could be so severe too." When at length they were seated at the table, Charity's place was vacant. In their new-found joy they had forgotten her; now they looked questioningly at each other. At length one of the elder girls arose saying, - "I will seek her." "No! no I! child, take your seat. Don't you all know Charity? she must be left alone with her trouble. The battle is bound to be fought. Leave her by herself; the sooner she meets it, the sooner it'll be over. You couldn't do her any good. I've known Charity from a baby," said Old Reliable sadly. Where was Charity? Night! A bright moon in a winter sky, and beneath, the earth, cold, and still, and corpse-like, wrapped in snowy cerement. A cruel night! No wind stirring; but the air so full of angry, penetrating chill; a night in which one would freeze stark and stiff, in a very little space. Out in such a night! Beside a snowy hillock-a new-made grave-knelt a figure enveloped in black, passive and immobile as a thing of stone; all about her, monuments and low slabs of marble, and shutting her in from them, many un- marked graves. Thus, while the hours sped away, a sentinel among the dead, with eyes vacant and passion- less, ever fixed on the road outside the open gate. Nine clear peals from the town clock, and silence. So the moments came and went in bitter, sullen quiet, until they formed an hour.  A gleaming, frozen thing, bear- ing its burden of joy and anguish, good and evil, into the irrecallable past, until God should claim it. The   42        H HONOR BBRIGHT. town clock rang its knell. Ten. Then another hour, ,and still another burden. Eleven. The night so cruel! heaven so markingly bright! and the figure crouching by the hillock so still, so like a corpse, with a pall wrapped about it, and eyes fixed on the road, with dull, dumb stare. In the distance, where it made its bend, a dark object appeared. Slowly it approached, nearer and nearer until in the full moon I it was revealed - a light wagon drawn by a single horse - closer and closer, until it reached the very gate; then halted. Two figures, muffled to their very eyes, sprang out, and with spades and ropes stole stealthily in at the gate, creeping among the tombs toward the hillock with its sentinel. Now they were before it. One glance, a cry of horror, and they fled from the supernatural apparition, dropping the implements of their guilty project, in their fright; then drove furiously toward the distant town. A wild gleam of triumph shot through those watching eyes, but as soon as the incident was passed, they faded into their dull, meaningless stare again. The long, long moments, how they lagged! The cold, the cruel cold, how it grew, and grew in its intensity; the moon, how its bright silver light shimmered and glittered! and the figure crouching by the hillock-was it living? or a spectre? The dead watching o'er the dead? The eye-lids fixed and frozen wide, with eyes beneath glazed and glaring, and full with horrible vacancy; the face a thing of marble; the lips a faint, dun line, and the hands lifeless, limp, and clasped in mute despair. The figure enveloped in its black drapery seemed frozen upright, but at length it tottered, wavered, and fell forward upon the hillock, its face downward. Peal--  -pealpeal-from the town clock--twelve of the night.          R   BONOR BRIG HT.          43 A private parlor in a hotel. A bright fire on the hearth, shutting out the cold; damask drapery at the casements, shutting out the night, easy chairs and lounges, and a table holding newspapers and light literature. Of this pleasant parlor, two gentlemen were the occupants. When two women are alone together, they talk; two men are silent and moody.   Witl women it is, the latest fashion; the last party; what So-and-so wore, and what Mr. So-and-so said/   The last new novel; and once in a great while, inr a measure redeeming all the other silly tattle, if they be mothers, they talk of the children. Women never talk so much as when only two; with them the number is conducive to confidence. "If you'll not mention it, I'll tell you something that will astonish you, about somebody." There can rightly be only two in a secret, and all women dote on a secret. "If you'll never; never tell," has such an irresistible charm. When two men are alone, the effect is exactly con- trary. Wit them alone number produces conviviality and lack of restraint; two, to them, is suggestive of reticence and taciturnity. Men are not so much given to gossip as women are, nor so much interested in detail and small things. We mean most men, and most women. Their lives are necessarily larger and broader, whilst woman's life is essentially contracted.  In man's life there is care and responsibility. He has an object to attain; his powers are all active in its pursuit. Allow it is only the amashsing of a fortune; or the supporting of a family; or even himself; still it is an object. But women! the most of them are not obliged to give thought to ways and means. Bread and butter to them,   "        HONOR BRIGHT. are simply thngs to eat, not toil and labor behind count.' ers or desks, and flour at fifteen dollars a barrel. They are expected to be mere painted butterflies; pretty to be looked at, and refreshing after a day's work. If any is brave enough to step beyond her fashionable beat, and strive to live to some purpose, educating heart and brain, and do good in the world, she is called eccentric, not philanthropic, and is branded with the epithets, "strong minded," and " blue." Men are afraid of her, and add to every other stigma, the hated " old maid." To those compelled to earn a livelihood, are allotted only the meanest positions and most paltry pay, "woman's sphere," and "unsexing the sex," and the: many other such aphorisms being thrown in the teeth of any bold and daring enough to demand a larger field. The only sphere allotted to woman, as yet, that is large, noble, elevating, is a true wifehood, a true mother- hood- there her influence is holy, grand, and' world-wide. None is so near the Maker as the mother. It has ever been so, since Christ the Lord was born of woman. But of these two men, one was a humpback. He was reclining amidst the soft, rich cushions of a lounge, wheeled near the fire, supporting his head on one thin, white hand, whilst the other toyed with the tassels of his cashmere dressing-gown. His face was beautiful, and delicate as a woman's; every feature faultless; the com- plexion fair; the hair a pale chestnut-brown, rippling in soft waves from the broad brow, far down over the raised shoulder; the eyes, now fastened on the fire, were dark, vivid, eloquent. And the mouth, - some one has said "that God makes the eyes, but each man makes his own mouth." Thus it is the only true index to the character. This mouth was a story in itself. It had full, soft lips, voluptuous and sensuous, whilst about 'its corners were   HONOR BRIGHT.,          45 lines, which, if contracted and tense, would make one shudder at the indomitable will and fierce, cruel determin- ation, that told plainly the, man would not stop at any means to accomplish his ends. Now, these lines were re- laxed, and the lips were yielding and tempting, whilst the face was pensive and dreamy, and wearing over all that expression of pain, whether past or present, that makes each humpback, without regard to feature, resem- ble every other- a resemblance that has its birth in tho brotherhood of suffering. The other gentleman sat, with chair drawn near a table, reading. They were brothers; but there was nothing to proclaim the fact. The one reading was a trifle above the medium height, with fine figure, and peculiar elegance of bearing. He, unlike his brother, was not handsome. His hairj a very light brown, was cut close to his finely-shaped head. His features were irregular, but the expressions of his face'were infinite in their qualities. The eyes of no definite color; when quiet and passive, they were a faded blue; but when earnest or excited, they were keen and searching, and grew dark to brilliancy in the intensity of their gaze. The mouth was large, firm, and full of char- acter. When silent, it was stern to severity; but when in conversation, there was a world of fascination in the wondrous versatility of its expression. There was some- thing in the man's head that would have attracted the phrenologist's attention. Its noble contour, and broad, expanded brow, were suggestive of genius, disclosing wonderful capacity and ability. Few tasks could be set him too difficult for accomplishment. His brain was thoroughly active; never dormant. In manner, he was a always self-possessed and graceful Nothing could con- fuse him.   "       HONOR BRIGHT. These were the brothers, Mark and Clare Mallory. Mark, thirty-five, and the elder by two years. They had sat thus in silence for hours. At length the hump- back brokq the quiet by a yawn, saying, in a tone of discontent, - "This is unendurable!" The other made no reply, saving to look at his watch. Then he closed his book, and resting either elbow on the table, buried his face in his hands, a habit that had clung to him from childhood, and which, though peculiar and boyish, was not without that certain grace that character- ized his every movement.        . Then again there was silence. This time the elder broke it by rising, and taking his coat from where man- like he had carlessly thrown it on a chair, several hours before. "Where the d--l are you going now, Mark!" ex- claimed the other, half rising from his pillows. "Out," was the laconic reply. "Humph! tantamount to telling me it is none of my business!" in an offended tone. "I am going back to the Institute, Clare," with a shade of impatience at having his motions questioned. He never pried into any man's actions, and would not brook espionage from another. "If I did not know you just as well as I do, I'd say you were either an egregious fool, or stark mad!" said Clare, in a peevish, virulent tone. +    * "It is well you know me, then," was the sententious reply, as he fastened his fur collar and took his hat. The other was looking at his watch. "Why, Mark, it is midnight, and as cold as a certain place, not mentionable in polite society, is reputed hot. (e   HONOR BIIGHT.          47 What the d   1 possesses you?" in a pleasanter voice, and looking curiously at his brother. "Nothing, Clare, nothing possesses me; to my certain knowledge, I am  my own master," with a light, free laugh. "That's so! You manage to take it all out in pos- sessing. . All your life you have only had to want a thing, and it was instantly yours. You have been lucky from your cradle. ' Everything you touch turns to gold; with me, lead," bitterly. The other paid no heed to the remark, but turned toward the door, saying, ere he opened it,- "Shall I order you anything, Clare? oysters, cham- pagne, or anything else?" "No, I want nothing." Then the door separated them. Out in the night. What had tempted Mark Mallory to leave a bright fire, and easy-chair, and books, to go out into such a night? What, but that Fate that leads us all to do things that to others, and even ourselves. seem strange and unaccountable, -- mere whimsicalities, -but which, in fact, if viewed in the light of our occult destinies, are perfectly natural. Fate sets her times, and men leave every employ and start out blindly to fulfil them. There was nothing to take Mark Mallory to Bright In- stitute that night.- Absolutely nothing. Doubtless, its inmates would all be sleeping when he reached it. Yet some uncontrollable restlessness, some power felt though undefined, drew him thither. He smiled at his owni folly, as he sprang into the cutter brought out for him, but he did not turn back. It was one trait in Mark Mallory's strong character, never to abandon anythiny   48        HONORI BRIGHT. once undertaken. It was one secret to his wonderful success. Surely, there could be no attraction at the Institute- no magnet to draw him thither; most men would have shrunk from it with horror. He had known it only as a place noxious with disease and death. He had never seen so much keen, poignant suffering crowded into so short a space of time, as the last few days had disclosed to his observant eye, - a suffering rendered all the more acute from the educated mental force brought to bear against it. If the pain had been physical only, it could have been endured. That is why the terribly sunken and degraded poor pass through: so much misery, and survive. With education and refinement comes increase of capacity either for suffering or enjoyment. Thus mortals, with their narrow natures, can never realize to the full the anguish of the God-man, Christ. This very suffering had had its attraction for Mark Mallory. There was a refined torture, a mental and moral agony in it, that had a charm for him. He saw it in them all, but in none so palpably as the girl who had led-him first to the building. He had watched her with an interest that amounted to fascination. She was utterly unlike any he had ever met before. He had seen her since the death of the man she loved, white and stony as a statue. Shedding no tears, but shutting herself from all human sympathy in her grief. Whilst the body was unburied, she was ever at its side. Never raising her eyes, with their intense, dry agony,. from the white, peaceful face. No one spoke to, or sought to lead her away, and the stranger had never entered the room where the dead lay, that he had not seen her its silent, statue-like watcher. To this man- a keen obser- ver of human nature--she was a study. He enjoyed   HBONOR BRIztHT.         49 watching her, much as a mathematician would the solving of a difficult problem. The women he had been wont to mingle with were 'creatures of fashion, who had been brought up with the one idea-dress; with the one object--to make a desirable match; in other words, "to marry an establishment;" hence, this girl was a novelty. She had interested him before her grief; still more so since. She had loved, and lost, yet never shed a tear. She had not even braced herself against it, with firm-set lips, as she had done with the wind those few days ago, when he had met her, but had received it like one who has gotten a blow and is stunned. White, passive, and had it not been for the fierce, smothered agony in her eyes, one would have said, indiff'erent. He had thought of all this the little while he had sat with his face buried in his hands, and from this thought sprang that whimsical impulse, the yielding to which had sent him out into the night. The cold was bitter,icy, penetrating. He felt it, for all his fur mufflers and buf falo robes. In and out the streets of the town, until the the houses scattered into the less populated suburbs; around the bend of the road, where the light wagon had passed scarce an hour ago. The burying-ground in view, and almost passed; then, by another of those unaccounta- ble impulses, or we might better say magnetisms, he glanced carelessly in among the tombs. Something black on a snowy hillock, in the broad light of the moon. He drew sudden rein and looked more keenly.  They must have carelessly left the pall- from the afternoon's burial. But the explanation failed to satisfy him. Mark M5allory did not know the meaning of the word fear; neither was he a man to pass silently by a mystery. With charac- teristic decision, he turned back to the gate, and spring- ing out, fastened the spirited horses securely to one of its 4   50        HONOR BRIGHT. posts; then entered the yard. Midnight! utter silence; grave-stones gleaming in the moonlight. Still he wended his way fearlessly, with quick, light tread, among the ob- structing tombs to the hillock with its apparition. A slight figure, wrapped in a thin black shawl. He knew it instantly, and stooping, laid his hand gently on her shoulder, saying in a tone of concern, "(Child, what has brought you here on such a night?" No answer.                   ' He looked startled. How long had she been there? Was she sleeping? Out in such a night, with that mere rag of a shawl! a horrible sdread seized him; he knelt beside her, and gently raised the face from where it had fallen in the snow, turning it over that he might see it. White and ashy, with its dun lips and wide, vacant eyes. He shuddered. The keen, cruel air seemed, pregnant with death. He bent his head low to the lips; no breath escaped them. He laid his hand upon the heart; its pas- sionate throbs were still. It was merciful! saved from a great sorrow, but how sad an end to a sadder life!     ' How long had she lain thus? Was she past recovery? With Mark Mallory to think, was to execute. He sprang to his feet, and stooping, lifted the slight figure, heavy now with the terrible weight of lifelessness, in his  arms, and then commenced threading his way carefully among the tombs to the awaiting cutter. He lifted in the inanimate form, laying her on the one seat, "then ten- derly, and with the reverential hands with which we are wont to touch the dead, enveloped her in the soft, Warm robes; Then untying the horses sprang in beside her, giv- ing free rein to the impatient steeds, and even urging them on in his own fearful impatience, whilst the lithe form on the seat which he kept steady, with one arm   Hf ONOR BRIGHT.         51 thrown lightly over it, was cold and still, with wide, glazed eyes looking vacantly from the upturned face. It seemed as if the road was interminable. The cold increased with terrible intensity; the hand which held the reins, for all its fur gauntlet, was stiff and benumbed; whilst the arm thrown protectingly over the white, ghastly figure, grew heavy and lifeless; the chill was creeping to his very heart. He set his lips firmly, urging the horses to still greater speed, thinking with a shudder how the chill had crept slowly, slowly, to the still heart beside him; how the swoon-like drowsiness had gathered, and gathered, until with powers of resistance weakened through grief, she had yielded and slept the fatal sleep so laden with deceitful, sweetness. On and on he urged the, horses over the road, ever between the mighty hills, the road which in these last few weeks had grown used to the traverse of the dead. What cared they, those mighty hills, if there was still another? There was nothing pitiful in the ghastly, ashen face to them. They looked down on it, nor ever changed their bright glistening in the moonlight. No wind,--it would have been a relief,--but only the icy, penetrating cold shut in between the walls of snow. Little by little, on the left the hills fell away, stretching into *narrow plain of snow, bounded on the one side by the hills, on the other by the deep ravine or mountain gorge; in the distance, hanang  on its precipitous bluff, loomed the gray turrets of Bright Institute. Now at length it was reached; he sprang from  the sleigh and lifted the body in his arms. Chilled and benumbed as he was, he tottered beneath its- dull, limp weight, and almost staggered up the steps. The horses, with their wonderful brute instinct, stood motion- less, though unsecured.  He had his own key, but the hand that sought to fit it to its key-hole was stiff and   52        HONOR BRIGHT. powerless; the vestibule was dark, and the body so fear- fully heavy! At length, in one of its many passings over, it slipped in - he turned it - then rolled back the massive e^ v doors, and entered. A dim light burned in the pendant lamp; by it he found his way to that door in the corridor to which she had first guided him. He entered the room; there was no light there; the fire had burned itself to a heap of ashes; he groped his way to where he knew a lounge stood; laid her on it; then went out and closed the door after him, CHAPTER IV.

One month ago, a quiet conscience, and an eye that could fearlessly look any man in the face; now a secret sin; a foul spot on the soul; friends do not see it; they treat you as well, as cordially as ever, thinking you pure' and strong. They touch your hand, white and limp, and never suspect its sickening stain. They press you to visit their daugh- ters, or sisters, thinking you all that is noble in man. They praise your high business integrity rightly enough; you are strictly honest. - Then they laud your morality. Morality!

One month! what had it accomplished at Bright In- stitute? You would never have known the place, so metamor- phosed was it. Masons, carpenters, architects, and ex- perienced designers, had crowded those thirty days full to overflow with labor. The new owner had taken that grand domed hall as his model, and the eiitire building was made to correspond, until it had grown into the similitude of a Moorish pal- , ace of grand oriental splendor. The walls and partitions had been torn down, corridors    54        HONOR BRIGHT. widened and the apartments made fewer, but larger. All the halls above and below, like the main entrance, were marble tiled in rich mosaic patterns. The walls and ceil- ings frescoed with finest paintings and designs, whilst every niche was graced with exquisite statuary. Each corridor had its pendant lamp of wondrous beauty; some suspended from the hands of cherubs, with spread wings; others drooping from the bills of birds of rare plumage. The doors were of black walnut and stained glass. They were all thrown wide, and for all it was mid-winter, the genial heat of a summer's day pervaded; in its warmth even the frozen fountain had resumed its play. The stair- cases were of black walnut, with banisters curiously carved, and carpeted with Axminster and velvet of rich eastern colors. It was like the beautiful magical palaces of Arabian Nights; such as were conjured up by Alad- din's lamp, or the enchanted halls of the Alhambra. The apartments were in exquisite keeping, furnished with the same oriental grandeur and luxuriance. The floors covered with soft, rich velvet; the casements draped with damask and costly lace. No money had been spared, but wealth countless, guided by a refined, exquisite taste, had been lavishy expended. In one of the corridors many doors had formerly led into many small apartments. Now in its centre a beau- tiful fretted archway led into a long, grand gallery of art, filled with paintings and statuary, evidently the collection of a connoisseur, whilst the light had tieen arranged with artistic effect. One of the rooms was singularly unique ; its windows were of stained glass admitting the llight with softened brilliancy. 'Its floor, instead of being carpeted was of walnut, polished like a mirror; a few chairs of dark-green velvet, luxurious in their ease, were scattered about, forming its only furniture. It was,   Xll        GZOfOR BRIGHT.          5 semi-circular in shape, being situated in one of the towers, In one of its sides was built an organ, imposing in effect, with a stool of the same green velvet drawn up before it, and close beside it a rack full to overflow with sheet music and bound books. Who was the musician? There was another peculiarity in the building; there were two libraries. One in the main tower, -the room into which the new owner had first been ushered. Just one's idea of a library; with rich crimson furniture, the light stealing in through the parted drapery; a bright fire on the grate; rare statuettes on slight marble slabs; two or three ex- quisite engravings of historical designs; a musical clock on the mantel, a light-stand holding stray books, and an astral lamp of elurious workmanship, and last of all, three massive book-cases. The other differed essentially, not that it was a less elegant apartment, but was more essen- tially a room of books; the cases being built in and run- ning entirely around the three sides of the room. The books ranged from ceiling to floor, and were shut from view by glass doors, on which, life size, were stained the figures of the muses on one side the room; on the second, a representation of Virgil meeting Dante at the gate of hell; on still the third, Beatrice guidinghim to the gates of Paradise; on the fourth side of the room, a grate fire burned; and over the mantel hung an exquisite copy of Beatrice and Dante. The town and surrounding country were full of wild reports of all this magnificence and the almost fabulous wealth of its new owner. The sheer idea of buying Bright Institute for a private resi- dence, to them was preposterous and the height of extrava- gance, but to transform it into such-a palace of beauty and grandeur, astonished them beyond expression.  There could be no end to the man's means; they thought he must be in possession of one of those wonderful purses,  56        EONOR BRIEHT. that fairies long ago used to bestow on favored mortals. In addition to every thing else, he had purchased the huge Iron Furnace, always before owned by a stock com- pany, and had doubled the number of hands employed. ' Some of the oldest and most influential men of the place, said the man was a young giant in business capaci- ty. A Napoleon in merchandise. A  century did not produce two such. At thirty-five he numbered his pos- sessions in the millions. One month. It seemed incredible that so much could have been accomplished in so short a time. But "many hands make light work:" each man had a job and fin- ished it, and "money makes the mare go," is a trite say- ing and a truism as well. Where were the old occupants? the boys and girls whom we saw last about the supper-table? There was now no trace of them. Many well-trained servants moved noiselessly about, performing their several duties; and occasionally gliding through the corridors, or up and down the broad stair- ways, was a middle-aged lady, clad in deep mourning, with a widow's cap shading a face of unusual sweetness. Also wandering restlessly from room to room, and often stopping to rest on some luxurious lounge, or sleepy hol- low, was the humpback we have described. Those whose home the building had formerly been, were all gone, yet there was not one of them, but was full of praise and gratitude for the new owner. For the girls, there had been good homes found; and positions as teachers, for such as were old enough. The boys had been put in, a way to take care of them- selves, and not one of them but loved Mark Mallory, and was proud to call him by the name which, with his frank grace he had termed them  each, "friend."  He had ,   X^* '           HONOR ERIGEE. I assured them he would ever feel an interest in them, and exacted the promise, that if ever a time of trouble came to any of them, they would come to him. We said they were all gone. Where, then, was the, girl, of whom this story seemed to tell? In a remote portion of the building, far removed from the noise and confusion, was the hall through which we have passed before. It alone remained in its pristine state. No hand of carpenter, painter, or designer had been laid upon it. The doors leading into the chambers still stood open, with their bleak, uninviting aspect. One alone was closed. The interest of our story centres there. The apartment had been made as comfortable as possi- ble, without confusion; a soft, rich drugget had been spread temporarily over the bare floor; a damask curtain rudely stretched across the window mellowed the light; a bright fire burned upon the hearth; and a coaxing easy- chair was drawn close beside the bed. Moving noislessly about the room was the tall, gaunt figure of Old Reliable, whilst on the bed lay one, who in all this month of which we have been telling, had been lost to the world of consciousness. One from whose life that space of time' had fallen into chaos. One month! unaccountability! a time for which God would demand no answer! blank! void! nothingness! Death had been thwarted.& Disease took its revenge. Brain fever, in its most aggravated form, had been the fruit of exposure and grief. She had raved as one bereft of reason for many days; then the system too much spent for frenzy, she sank into a stupor even more alarming, and had lain thus for the last two weeks. Old Reliable had been her constant attendant. We must say a word of this woman. She was about sixty years of age, five feet ten in    58        HONOR BRIGHT. height, with a sharp, angular figure. Her hair was iron- gray; she wore it streaked back from her face and twisted into a little knot about the size of a walnut on the top of her head. The head thus exposed to view would have delighted a phrenologist, so prominent were some of its bumps for instance, firmness, conscientiousness, com- bativeness, secretiveness; then about the eyes, language; a little above, memory, with mirthfulness -a weird, whimsical sort of mirthfulness, by the way -well devel- oped; then around to the side, love utterly fused and lost in the farge contiguous bump of friendship. The face was peculiar. It was yellow and wrinkled as a bit of old crisp parchment; to the unintiated as full of hiero- glyphics as any Egyptian mummy. The mouth was large, firm, and decided; the lips hav- ing a curious wayofturningown at the corners  he displeased, and up when the contrary, that gave the ludicrous effect of being turned up-side-down, or wrong side out, at will. The nose was small, and, in unqualified phraseology, it was pug, always supporting a pair of spectacles, and very often two. The eyes were small and gray; when abstracted or passive, they had the appear- ance of near-sightedness, but when interested they looked through the spectacles, keen, clear, and scrutinizing; when angry or excited, the. second pair of glasses were brought into requisition, and woe to the unhappy wight who, through those double lenses, was found guilty. Such was Old Reliable's head and face; her heart was the kind, true heart of a woman, and a friend. In these weeks made she had watched the sick girl untiringly, with hands gentle by'the latent motherhood, that exists in -every true woman's heart. Thus far, the care and watching had all been futile. To-day was to tell the story. Old Reliable stood by the   HONOR BRIGHT.          59 bed-side, straight and still, solitary watch and nurse, waiting for its reading. This fearful lethargy to-day would be dispelled, either by death or life. The physician had said the climax must come ere night. The hours stole by. They brought the woman her meals as usual; she took them through the crack of the door, her long, gaunt fingers silencingly on her lip, to prevent word or question; then stood them to one side untasted, and re- newed her vigil. The morning had gone. High-noon- then the change/ came. A strange working of the vacant, expressionless fea- tures; a convulsive twitching of the passive limbs; life and deathf were contending-- which would conquer? The woman by the bed-side- staunh, firm, composed to ppatrent idiferlrenee usually-atthatAurledi herea- away, for the first time a coward.         ' She had wiped the death-dew from many a brow, and composed the .distorted, convulsed features, but this girl had been her favorite; she had been her charge from in- fancy. She could not see her die. The small .gray eyes were dim to blindness; the corners of the scroll-like mouth drawn pitifully down. The seconds stole into minutes- minutes of terrible silence and suspense; then the lips came together with a firm, hard pressure; she swallowed something like a great bundle that seemed to disturb her breathing; then, raising the glasses on her eyes, glanced toward the bed. One quick, questioning glance-then the second pair of spectacles were adjusted with nervous, agitated fingers, and through the two looked the keen eyes, clear and searching now. Sleeping as sweetly, as peacefully as a new-born babe; one arm tossed with natural grace above the head, the other supporting the chin. Over the wan face spread the ,   uuVl\  BRIGHT l glow of life renewed, whilst the breath came softly, reou- larly, through the half-parted lips, and about eye and mouth was the expression a little, tired, troubled child 'wears, when all is at least partially forgotten in sleep. And the woman watching so silently, she could not see now, for all her double glasses. They were far down over her wrinkled, yellow cheeks, those tears. She had seen many die unmoved, but this one restored to life had touched I the fountain-spring, and for the first time in many years she wept. They were no quiet, trickling tears, such as many women rather enjoy shedding, but the sobs shook her tall frame until it quivered in every' nerve; she crouched down on the floor, throwing her arms above her head, burying her face in her knees, and striving to stifle them, but it was of no avail. The fountain so long sealed was open; nothing could close the valve; they must have vent; but the silent sleeper on the bed was utterly uncen- scious of all around. Nature, exhausted, had found her only restorer. At length the woman grew composed, wiped her eyes, and rising stood by the bed-side again. Then there was a faint rap on the door. The master's knock; she had grown to know it, and wait for it too, in those days. The withered face brightened until it fairly glowed with gladness; she went to the 'door, opened it, and ere he could put the question, pointed to the sleeper. He glanced ins the assigned direction; then at the wo- man, with'her tear-stains and gladness. She had cried for joy, this queer, stiff, cold woman. He held out his hand for hers, his face full of congratulation, and a world of honor and respect in his manner; then they shook hands, and ho went away. i   CHAPTER V.

AFTERWARD were those long tedious weeks of conval- essence, that always succeed a fever. The girl neither seemed to have the heart nor the  will to recover.  She Dmanifested no interest in anything; did not seem con- scious of the many comforts that had made the cheerless apartment bright and pleasant; nor seemed to see    Old Reliable, or be grateful for her constant care. A sleep- ing lethargy seemed to have given place to a waking one. Old Reliable, naturally taciturn, watched her in anxious silence. She was utterly passive in her hands; took the ton- ics she administered without resistance or question; would either lie on the bed, or sit propped up in the easy-chair. the master had sent up for the woman's comfort,-just as - Old Reliable willed. She appeared unconscious that any change had transpired in the old home. Only one thought possessed her; she was utterly oblivious of the present, overwhelmed in the grief of the past. It was a bright Winter's morning, about three weeks after the scene we described in our last chapter. The girl, surrounded by pillows, was seated in the easy-chair, the woman was working about the room, parting wide the   62       tHONOR BRIGHT. damask to let the sunlight in; raking the grate fire; striv- ing, as she did many times a day, to attract her attention and awaken her interest. "Reliable." It was the first time the girl had spoken, excepting in direct answer to questions, for weeks. The woman started, looking up from her stooping position before the fire, with a pleased expression. "Well?" in her sharp, quick way, that would have given a stranger no inkling into her feelings. "Have they all gone?" timidly, as if dreading the reply. "Yes, child, all but you and I," laying down the poker, and settling herself comfortably on the floor, her long, gaunt arms around her knees, a favorite position when in conversation. The girl sighed. "What's the use, Charity? They are better off by far. The master found them good homes," with a brusque sort of cheerfulness. "He's a gentleman; I knew it by his cut," decisively. The girl said nothing, but seemed, lost in, thought again. Old Reliable would not let her off so easy; she was too good a general to quietly lose an advantage. She had gained her ground, and meant "to fight it out on that line." So went on a little gruffly: "If he hadn't been the true gentleman and kind master he is, we wouldn't have been here all this time, and you treated as well as if you'd been his sister or wife, as for that matter," with whimsical humor in the last part of the remark. But the girl only heard the first, and asked, looking at her with an eager sort of dread, -    "      .   tEtONOR BRIGHT.         63 "How long is it?" "Nine weeks, child, since he brought you home, dead, we all thought. It's a good master and a kind he is." "Brought me home from where, Reliable?" fearfully. "Don't you remember, child? from Ralph's grave." The first time his name had been spoken, it was done softly, reverently. She shuddered, trembling from head to foot, then buried her face in her hands, and cried as if her heart would break. Thl first tears she had shed, they cleared the be-fogged memory, swept away the last vestige of lethargy, and left her, though powerless in bodv, strong and bright in mind. Old Reliable let them have full flow. It was what she had sought   vain for many days; then lifted her in her strong arms, as if she had been a babe, and laying her on the bed, covered her warmly; then stooped, and for the first time since her babyhood, kissed her; after- ward drew the curtain, and watched her fall asleep. When she awoke, it was twilightlt For some time she lay so silent that if it had not been for the open, earnest eyes, one might have thought that she still slept. Pres- ently she raised herself on her elbow, and looked around the room. It was full of the shadows that firelight cast. The rich, soft drugget, the damask curtains, the luxurious chairs-she sawthem all for the first time. Ifthey made any impression,. a casual observer would not have sus- pected it. The eyes shon left them, and brought to bear upon the tall, angular figure of Old Reliable; The woman was seated on the floor, her back to the room, her, long arms clasped about her knees, on which rested a volume which she was reading. -  The girl leant forward to catch a glimpse of the book; at its sight she turned deathly pale. "Reliable," in a husky voice.   "        OOR HONOR BRIGET. Thbede woman started, closed the volume, and came to the bedside. . "Do you believe that. " the tones almost sharp with eagerness. The woman looked a trifle startled, and answere slowly, - "I can't rightly answer your question, child though : dare not say no." "Read to me," wistfully. "What, child! I don't know it clearly enough to make a pick; and there is so muct in it, it is wonderful," turning the leaves between the two covers. "Read the first words in it," sitting erect in the bed. 'To be sure, child, where should a body begin if not at the beginning? How dull of me!" Then she read in a clear, comprehensive tone, that sim- ple, yet wondrous declaration of the existence and om- nipotence of God,        - "In the beginning God created heaven and earth" and so on through the entire story of the world's creation. When she finished, she glanced at the young girl; her eyes were flashing with excitement and interest; her cheeks 1ltshed and feverish. She closed the book instantly. There, you are not strong enough to hear any more," and as she spoke, she placed the volume under her pil- low. It was the Bible Ralph had left her. The act was a kindly, delicate one, such as you would not have expected from so cold and ascetic a looking woman. The girl caught the hand that did the deed and kissed it; then lay down again, turning her face to the wall. Reliable went back to the fire, and so an hour passed. Then the woman again came to the bed-side, and leant   XHONOR BRIEHT.         65 over to see did she sleep again. The eyes were wide, and unnaturally brilliant. "Charity!" She turned and sat erect in the bed, seeming almost strong. The woman dreaded the effect of this intensity of thought, and wisely sought to change the current. "You've never asked a word about anything. Most girls would be curious to hear about the master's Insti- tute and the family," bungling in her new effort at sub- terfuge. "Well?" indifferently, never noticing the mistake. Not heeding the damper in her tone, the woman went on, with unusual loquacity, - "There's three of themselves, and a host of servants, into the bargain.  The master, and his mother and brother. The brother is deformed. I saw him twice on the stairs; and the mother is like the Sisters of Mercy, that used to visit the orphan asylum in old England. I remember them well, for all I have been right here, in this very building, ever since I was ten years of age. And then the Institute itself! Why, child, you'd never know it for the old place; it is every inch of it as beauti- ful as the grand hall we've been so proud of always. It is as beautiful as a palace, only this old, cold, cheer- less sleeping-hall has not been touched. And there the master showed his kindness too, by keeping off the con- fusion; most men would not have given you a thought." There was a faint flush of pleasure on the girl's face; her answer did not betray it, however. "Reliable, I should not have been sick so long; we have no right here." The woman in order to rouse her had been insinuating this thought constantly, but now when her purpose was effected, her bump of combativeness led  her in direct   6        EtONOR BSRGHT. opposition to her former object; she exclaimed indig- nantly, -- "No right indeed! we have the right all honest people have to claim help in trouble." The girl meanwhile was gathering her wrapper closely about her, and slowly getting out of the bed. "What are you about, child?" demanded the woman, in a contumacious tone. "I'm going to walk about the room," was the quiet rejoinder. Old Reliable. understood her, and raised no objec- tion. She went very feebly, almost tottering, and hold- ing on to the, furniture for support; then came back to the easy-chair and sat down, looking tired. The woman arranged the bed, shook up the pillows, and made the room  tidy, the girl watching her with a vague, troubled expression. At length, all being done, Reliable came to a dead pause directly in front of the girl, and folding her gaunt arms behind her, a habit she had, said in the cool, resolute tone 'of one expecting oppo- sition, and determined to-overcome it,- "Charity, the master's mother has wanted to see you ever ince she came. I   told her she might come this evening."  Ere any objection could be offered, there was a low, gentle rap at the door. "Come!"  called Reliable, in a clear, shrill voice. Charity flushed, and bit her lip with vexation. The door opened, and the master's mother entered-the gtntle-lookingo lady in mourning we have before spoken of.  The girl, with the natural grace of lady born, rose to receive her guest, who advanced with an expression of mingled interest and astonishment. She had expected   HONOR BRrIGT.         67 to see a bashful charity scholar; here was a self-possessed, even dignified woman. "Be seated; you are not strong; I am glad' you are better," in a gentle voice. The girl obeyed, whilst Reliable handed the lady a chair; she drew it to Charity's side, with the easy air of one accustomed to society. There was a certain pride too, in her bearing, for all her beautiful, gentle face; and about the sweet, facile mouth were some traces of haughty lines, as if the spirit, now so mild and lovely, had been the fruit of discipline and trouble. "You have had/a very sad time. I wanted to come. and see you sooner, but Reliable would not allow it." There was a world of sympathy in, the kind voice. The young girl thanked her, her lip quivering at' the words " a very sad time." The lady noticed it, and said cheerfully,- "Never mind; you will soon be well now. It will be good when you are ablq to go about the building. Change of scene is always beneficial. . One is apt to grow morbid, if left too much alone."  "You are very kind; I can never repay either you or your son. I trust I shall riot be much longer dependent," said the girl, with a certain touch of pride mingled with the true gratitude of her voice. Intuitively the lady felt it, and acknowledged it in her reply. "You must not say so; we have done nothing. This was your home; we robbed you of. it. Ours is the obli- gation," earnestly; then added, "My son has been away for a week; he will soon return. You will not feel as you do, when you talk to him." The girl made no reply, though she looked decidedly dubious as to the predicted change of feeling, looking    68        HONOR BRIGET. forward with dread only, to meeting one to whom she owed so much - even her very life. Old Reliable was standing to one side, a silent listener. The corners of her odd mouth just a little turned up, in their pleased though ludicrous way, to see this lady of the world, by the silent courteousness and respect of her manner, acknowledging the' equality of this girl, in all her poverty. The lady was much inclined to talk, introducing one topic after another; the young girl manifesting a polite interest, though taking little part. Half an hour later, when she arose to bid good-night, she said considerately, glancing around the room as she spoke,-- "This is a wretchedly dismal sort of a place. I think you! would feel brighter in a pleasant apartment. When- ever you are able to make a change, you must let me know."                 . The young girl flushed a little, as she replied,- "You are kind. The room looks very pretty to me, but I am able to change at once. I have been a sad hindrance to work in this portion of the building already, I fear." "You mistake my motive, child," said the lady quickly. "It was not t]hat; the rooms might remain so always and make no difference. The ,building is large enough with- out it. It is simply to be made into a billiard room and bowling alley., It is a cheerless place now though, per. fectly forsaken in appearance," with a slight expression of disgust, and adding with a bit of a shiver, "Mark tells me the whole building, with the exception of the main hall, was in keeping, and cold at that. I don't wonder at the result of such hardships." The girl grew deathly pale as she spoke. Old Relia- ble noticed it, and the corners of her mouth turned down   o9 HON0y BRIGT.           .6 with displeasure at the lady's thoughtlessness.

She  looked around in silence; then covered her eyes with her hand as if to shut it all out. Old Reliable was watching her. "Well, Charity?" questioningly. She glanced up. "Are there no plainer rooms than this, Reliable?"    "None, excepting those in the servants' hall, and my own, which is just as good, only it hasn't so many furbe- lows." Then adding in a tone of whimsical drollery, I didn't expect you to be satisfied; it isn't your nature." The girl smiled, and said,- "I am as good as wells Reliable; we can leave here in     a few days." "Humph!" was the'significant retort. Two or three days passed; Mrs. Mallory gave the girl  a call everyday, always telling her, as if to comfort her, that her, son might come any moment; until, with the tendency to morbidness that always accompanies conval-  escenee, she grew to anticipating his return with a nervous dread that amounted almost to terror. Then, too, she retarded her recovery, by over-reading, for when alone, the Bible which Ralph had left her was seldom out of her hand.' Ach day she tried her strength by walking through  the upper corridors and chambers, and at length, one  afternoon, wandered slowly down-stairs, in a sort of maze at all the grandeur and beauty, and led by an irre-  sistible impulse, sought the old library, so fraught with  memory. -A's she entered, she sto0od dumbwith won-  derand adniration, at its unique elegance. The library with As glass doors so exquisitely stained, the engraving over the mantel, all brought suddenly to her mind the  , ,   HONOR BRIfGHTT.         71 only conversation she had ever held with the master of all this magnificence; her face, for an instant, flushed with pleasure,-  "Had that conversation suggested the idea?" She approached and swung wide the doors. The books remained untouched, each in its accustomed place. It was the only thing that told of the old home; her lips quivered at the sight:' she closed them and glanced toward the fire-place. A bright fire burned upon the hearth. It was the last place she had seen Ralph ere smitten with death; she went toward it, her hands out- stretched in a sort of pitiful, dumb pleading, her face deathly pale; then crouched down before it, and buried her face in her hands, her light frame quivering with one great, silent sob after another. 'The wonderful magnetism   of the human eye! The strange, electric power of will over will, felt though unseen! She glanced up, not knowing, not even. ques- tioning why, in her grief,; the master stood with folded arms regarding her! She brushed the tears hastily away, the trembling lips, by a strong effort of self-control so characteristic of her, grew still; she arose, and with quiet grace extended her hand. He took it, looking searchingly at her, this odd, self-contained girl; then said,-- "I am glad to see you so much better."   "Thank you," with a trifle of the tremor of the dread- ed meeting in her voice. Then he placed a chair for her, and remained. standing before her. She sat, her hand supporting her head, hers eyes fastened on the fire, vainly striving for words to clothe her thanks. He saw the struggle, and stood quietly enjoying it. The silence was intolerable to  her.  ,.   72        HONOR BRIGHT. She broke it at length, saying a little nervously, and look- ing up into his face as she spoke, - "I have so much to thank you for, I don't know where to begin."  He smiled. "Take my advice, and do not begin at all." "You have been doing something for me ever since the first time I ever saw you. It is strange!" going back in her thoughts, with a sort of vague wonder, to the day he had thrown his fur collar over her shoulders. He quietly waved the subject, saying,-- "Have you been able to go about the building at all?" "Not much, but enough to discover that you have transformed my 'Inferno' into 'Paradiso,"' her face aglow with admiration. "You would not have suspected that such was my design, if you had not in the first place unconsciously suggested the thought." "I! How?" wonderingly. "The answer lies in that picture. I will tell you, per- haps, some time," motioning to the engraving over the mantel. She looked at it with a questioning, puzzled expres- sion, not understanding. Yet'even a casual observer would have detected the secret. The resemblance lay in the brow and entire contour of the face, now rendered frail and ethereal by suffering. The dark, soulful eyes upraised; the beautiful, though characteristic lips now parted with the expression childhood wears when in won- derment; the resemblance was most striking. The master regarded the two faces with the astute, critical eye of a connoisseur. The girl evidently saw no answer to her question in the picture, and-presently'seemed to forget it, the eyes seeking the fire again in a troubled way.   HONOR BRIGHT.          73 For all the man's almost prodigal liberality, he was selfish. He saw this girl, pale and-wan from suffering, struggling to express what he already knew; overcome by a difficulty that he could obviate with a single word, but he would not speak that word. The face, with its dark eyes, earnest and perplexed; the lines about the mouth growing tense and contracted; the lips half firm, half trembling; it interested him; he stood regarding her with his cool, searching eyes; at length, glancing up, she met them; there was a bit of a smile in theta ; she detected it; her lips grew firm; she said,-- "I believe you know what I am   trying to say Mr. Mallory," most women would have added-" why don't you help me?" not so this girl, and the master made no move to give assistance unasked.   He liked her self- dependence, her- determination  to. lean on her own strength, even  though it might be weakened.   This stoical nature in woman was a novelty to him. So he waited, his arms folded, his eyes bent on her in quiet questioning. The wording was constrained, the voice a trifle agitated, for all effort to the contrary. "Mr. Mallory, I am  grateful to you -you believe it --I must incur no greater debt. I am well now, and can go any day-to-morrow, if I had a situation." "May   I ask what you propose doing?" in a cool business-like tone, and never moving' his eyes "Teach, sir. I believe my education is sufficient," more self-possessed. There was a bit of amusement about his mouth, as he put the next question; it purposely trenched on imper- tinence, though put in, most gentlemanly tone. "May I ask what you are competent to teach?" She flushed, and replied' with mingled pride and in-   7i4       j IONOR BRISBT. dignation. "Perhaps more than you would judge from appearance, sir."  His face was as immobile, as critical, as if he was on an examining committee in a village school, and his voice as unsympathizing. "You could teach arithmetic, I suppose." Her lip curled scornfully. 'I believe, sir, I am familiar with trigonometry and mathemetical astronomy." "Ah, indeed!" with well-feigned surprise, then add- ing, "I reckon, then, you could instruct in other branches, such as rhetoric?" "I have been drilled in Belles Lettres, curtly. "Well, the arts?" "I have been through several text books, and am conversant with Ruskin." "The languages?" " "In Latin I have read ' Livy;' French, I can read and write tolerably, though not speak it at all." "Music'?" She did not understand the quizzical play of his lips, nor suspect that he was catechizing her for his own pleasure, and to gratify his curiosity as to what she had studied; so at the last question she looked troubled. "It is a thing I know nothing of, sir; I have read of it and dreamed of it, but that is all." His face changed; the quiet, amused expression gave place to a glow of enthusiasm. "You have never heard any music!   You cannot dream the delight you have lost," then looking at her  searchingly, added, "Have you never heard any music- never?" "Yes, the singing of the birds and the ringing of the bells down in the village, when the air is clear. Then,   HONOR BRIGHT.          5  too," she added a little hesitatingly, as if doubting whether she should be understood, "I have heard the wind sing tunes in the pines, and in summer the brook in the ravine is full to overflow with melody." He looked pleased. "You have the appreciation and love of it, I see clearly. Some time, if you wish, I will play for you. I know a little about the organ." She thanked him, her face brightening with anticipa- tion. Then there was another silence, she looking into the fire again, he into her face. He broke it by another- question, a very blunt one, which ladies do not usually allow. He looked amused as he put it, "How old are you?" She answered very indifferently, without even raising her eyes, - "I was nineteen last May." "Then, by indefeasible right, this is your home for two years yet, until you are twenty-one." She started,looking up questioningly; she did not un. derstand him. "That is so, is it not? according to the laws of the Institute?" "No sir! for those laws are now absolete."  She thought he was trying to inveigle her into some avowal of discontent at the new ownership and dissolving of old ties, some questioning of his right to do as he chose with his own,* so was on her guard. "They are not nullified without I choose. to consider them so, are they?" with his keen, quiet eyes fastened on her. "Yes, sir, the institution belonged to the State; the laws could be administered only by its authority, or by the faculty."   76       EHOVNO   BRIGHT. He smiled. "Woman's reasoning," a little sarcastically. She bit her lip, saying in an annoyed tone,- "What has this to do with our former conversation? I do not understand the drift.." "Why, simply this: I don't choose to consider the old law defunct. This is your home rightly, and honestly, until you are of age." She flushed, her eyes filling with tears, her voice trembling. "Mr. Mallory, I cannot; you are very, very generous, but the debt of gratitude would oppress me, kill me; you do not know me." He smiled, saying in a cool, almost cynical tone,- "Neither do you know me.- There is nothing generous about me. I offer you a home. I have more than I know what to do with.  People tell me I am a fortunate fellow, born under a lucky star, and so on--perhaps they are right, in a moneyed view. It costs me nothing to be what you term generous," with a bitter sarcasm on the last word. She was looking at him in a sort of mute amaze. He spoke of money slightingly; of generosity with ; certain scepticism, that fascinated her. He went on,- "Though you may not acknowledge it, it is a species of latent selfishness in you to refuse my offer. By taking a position as teacher, you deprive some one positively in need of a situation, simply for the gratification of your vaunted independence." is Your -logic, though well sustained, and perhaps con' vincing on the surface, has a subtle falsity," she said curtly." I do not consider self-abnegation, at the expense of self-respect, a virtue."   HONOR  BRIGHT.         " He liked her the better for the very pride he was sneer ing at, though she did not suspect it. "Very well, then: I will forbear asking you to re. nounce independence. I will offer you a situation, and pay you a regular, systematic salary- though, perhaps, with your superior erudition, you may disdain its ac. ceptance," with well-feigned irony on that word superior. She colored, asking with dignity,- '"'May I know it?" He took a selfish pleasure in annoying her; so stood regarding her in silence for a moment;' theni continued,- "My brother; you have seen him, I suppose?" "Yes," huskily, and growing pale. She had seen him once at the'grave-yard gate. The reminiscence was pain- ful; he did not understand, but supposed she had seen him there in the building; consequently, misinterpreted her tone.                     * "You perhaps know the position, and are prepared to spurn it." "Oh, Mr. Mallory, you do not comprehend; I cannot explain; you cannot think me such an ingrate,' passion- ately.               , "Are you forever going to harp on gratitude to me?" he asked, in a bitter tone. Certainly not, if it is hateful to you," coldly. "It is," was the sententious reply. Then there was an uncomfortable silence. She broke it this time. "You were telling me of your brother."  "Yes," resting one arm on the mantel-piece, and coming back to the subject with composed, business-like manner. "He is an author. He contributes to several periodi- cals, and besides is writing a book.

Of course othere is no coercion in the matter; but if you choose to accept it, you will find it less confining, though fully as remunera- tive as teaching." She interrupted him, - "Pray do not speak of remuneration!   You cannot believe that I have given that a single thought! I thank you for the position with all my heart; that is, if- your brother does not object." Her voice was broken and agitated with grateful emotion. "Well, we will consider the matter settled;" then added with a smile, and extending his hand for hers,-- "Let us seal the contract and be friends, for we have come near quarrelling." She placed hers in his very frankly. He retained it a moment, for there was yet a shadow on her face. "Well?" "Old Reliable?  "Oh, her name gained her place as housekeeper the moment my mother heard it," he replied with a light laugh, releasing her hand. She thanked him for that too.  She was looking pale and tired, so arose to leave the room.  He called her back. "What am I to call you, please." "Charity." He looked amused at the characteristic brevity of the reply.

"But now the hand of fate is on the curtain, And gives the scene to light."-. DON SEBASTIAN. ABOUT twilight Mark Mallory sauntered slowly down one of the magnificent corridors, and stopped at a half- open door. He rapped. "Come!" from within. It would be difficult to designate by any name the room which he entered. It was neither library nor parlor. It combined the luxurious ease of a lady's boudoir and the labor of the author's study. It was a rich, elegant apartment; crimson damask draped the casements, luxurious sleepy-hollows of crimson velvet stood in graceful confusion; several mirrors mag- nified and reflected the room in their crystal depths; an elegant book-case stood with  wide-thrown doors; the volumes within, tumbled down, and hastily stacked away in great disorder; finest engravings decorated the walls, whilst rare statuettes graced curiously-carved brack- ets. Drawn near one of the windows, as if the writer had been following the light, was a s all, rosewood secretary, with loose scraps and bits of paper scattered about it, and even over the rich, soft carpet. A bright fire burned upon the hearth, and on a crimson lounge wheeled beside h  .   80   ,     HONOR BRIGHT. it, with dressing-gown wrapped about him, and his head resting wearily on the cushions, was Clare, the deformed gentleman we have already described. He looked weary; his long, wavy hair was swept back from his beautiful brow; a delicate, roseate hue flushed his fair cheeks, and about. his soft, ripe lips, was a certain 'misanthropical expression, which suggested the thought that he was not only tired of the labor he had evidently just abandoned, but of life too. As his brother entered, he raised himself on his elbow, and glanced toward him, with a latent, almost impercep- tible gleam of mingled jealousy and distrust in his dark, lustrous eyes. The expression, more or less, was always there when regarding his brother. "Well, Mark, when did you come?" "By a late train last night." "The deuce! where have you kept yourself?" "They were casting at the furnace. Some of the hands were inexperienced, and needed oversight." "Do you mean to say you haven't had any sleep all night, and look so fresh now?" looking at hilp with palpable envy. "I believe I said nothing about sleep, Clare. You are a wonderful fellow at hasty conclusions," with a light, teasing laugh. Then adding,-  "This time you are right though; I haven't slept for twenty-four hours." "AndI amn helpless with two hours' work. Yet people prate oabut the justice of God," in a hard, sceptical tone. The others paid no heed to it, but sought to divert his thoughts. He listened in sullen, moody silence, manifest- ing no interest, until at length his brother said, - "Clare, I have an amanuensis for you."   OHONOR BRIGlT Z        81 At that he asked, curtly,- Who?" "The young girl who has been sick up-stairs," suc- cinctly.   - "The d--1; a charity scholar. The proposition is tanamount to an insult," in a fierce, angry tone, and sit- ting erect. "Another hasty conclusion. Clare, you are the most impulsive fellow I ever met," was the cool rejoinder; then adding, '"You have never seen her, though she has you. I know it by your remark;" and adding,- "Please do not pass judgment until you have had evi- dence." The humpback swept back his long, beautiful hair ner- vously; his brother's impassiveness seemed to irritate him. "When am I to see her? what does she look like?" "You will see her at dinner., I will leave you to an- swer your last question yourself," drawing a chair near the fire, and sitting down. He had been standing with folded arms- a position peculiar to him-ever since he entered. The other was regarding him in angry silence. At length there was a mischievous, cunning play to the soft, voluptuous lips, and he said with forbidding gayety,- "I am thankful for one thing, I am not to have a man. Any woman would be a relief to this hellish monotony." Mark Mallory's face fairly flashed. He said, in a tone trenchant as steel,- ' Clare, this girl is under my roof; do   er- stand?" The other replied by a laugh. There     g startling in Clare Mallory's laugh; it had a cl lic ring, and a certain impishness in it, that made you shud- der involuntarily.

Four years is long enough to forget anything," in -a tone of cutting mock- ery, then laughing again. "Clare!" it was all the other said; it was enough. He had risen from his seat; his arms-were folded across his chest with statue-like dignity; his face -you should have seen the face of the master of all this wealth - it was grand in its fierce anger, white as a thing of marble, with lips colorless and set as if chiselled, the blue eyes fairly black in their intensity. The humpback cowered beneath his wrath, and whimpered with a shudder, - "Mark, I believe you would- hurl him down among the damned." "I would," in a voice of terrible composure, and he turned and left the room.            The humpback laughed; this time a smothered, gurg- ling laugh. Half an hour later the dinner-bell rang. When they were all seated, Mr. Mallory sent a servant for Charity; a few moments after, she entered the room. She was clad in deepest mourning, her bright, wavy hair was combed off from her face, and gathered in a loose knot at the back of her shapely head. Her dress was of simple stuff goods, yet there was a natural style and grace to her slight figure, that many a belle has sought in vain to acquire by the aid of art and fashion. -  jM ry arose as she entered; every trace of anger h]c^ajce. He introduced her to his brother, and lBpea    t opposite to the humpback, with his accus- tonSBP   She was quiet, self-possessed, even dignified.

Mr. Mallory and his mother sustained the conversation, the girl saying nothing except in direct answer to ques- tions. Clare was perfectly mute; he scarce ate for watch- ing the pale, expressive face opposite him; the persistence of his gaze at length annoyed her; she flushed a little, and avoided meeting his eye. The meal was constrained and formal until wine was served; then Clare became conversationally inclined. When' he so chose, he could be singularly entertaining; he was quick at repartee, told an anecdote'with irresistible humor, and had a natural, scintillating wit, that almost dazzled one. It charmed the young girl; for the first time since her great trouble she laughed. Mark looked pleased at his brother's gayety, regarding him with a certain proud affec- tion. Mrs. Mallory, too, appeared delighted, saying once, when there was a little pause,- "Clare, it really does me good; you have been so gloomy and dejected ever since we came here." When the meal was concluded, Mr. Mallory gave his arm to his mother, and Clare, with a certain winning helplessness, that women always meet, slipped his arm through the young girl's, saying, - "I am shorter than you." Mr. Mallory led the way to the old Institute library. "Why do you come here, Mark? it is the-o-ly room in the building I positively dislike," said   cap- tiously.                . . firs.

"To use more expressive that elegant phraseology, the place is spookcy to me,'? was the answer, as he threw him- self upon a lounge, and tossing his long hair with 'a cer- tain vanity over the velvet cushion, rested his face on his hand. Charity was watching him;' he knew it, and felt her unexpressed admiration, for the girl was amazed at the wondrous beauty of his face. "I cannot see why it should affect you so, Clare," said M[rs. Mallory. ( One cannot alway render a reason for their feelings. I thoroughly detest these cold dissectors of their own sensa- tion, analyzing every emotion. 'I would rather be all im- pulse," sneeringly, then adding, "I only know that I have an intuitive knowledge that this room is haunted. I feel myself surrounded by invisible spirits, the moment I enter it." At the last remark, Charity turned pale, and resting her head on her hand, with a sort of passionless languor, looked into the fire. Surely to her the place was haunted with memories. She forgot them all, those three, and wandered back into the past. a Ralph and she had spent. their evenings there for years, devouring with an appetite akin to starvation the volumes now hidden by those grand, imposing doors, with their life-like, life-sized figures. She lived them all over, those years, utterly unmindful of all about hers hearing their voices in conversation only as one hears confused sounds and murmurs in dreams. Mrs. Mallory had drawn her embroidery from her pocket; Mark had brought a chess-table, and he aid Clare were playing. The game amounted to little, however. Clare made repeated ill moves, his eyes often wandering to the quiet figure sitting near the fire. Marlk did not notice i his inattention; he seemed himself to be preoccupied and 4 troubled, as if some ghost of the past had been rudely   HONOR BRIGHT.          85 conjured up, to torment and annoy. Had that afternoon's conversation been the cause? At lkngsh Clare's oft-wandering eyes attracted his no- tice; he followed them; they rested first on the face of Beatrice; then on the girl's, with..her bright, wavy hair, her eyes so sad now, and her cheeks so very fair. Mr. Mallory smiled, and said in an undertone, reverting to the afternoon,- "You can answer your own question now." "Yes. Is that what you meant? had you thought of it?" looking at his, brother with that latent jealousy, as if envious even that he should have first discovered the resemblance; then adding,- "It bothered me all dinner-time. I knew her face was familiar;" as he spoke he swept the chessmen nerv. ously from the board, saying in a peevish tone,- "I'm bored to death with this game." Mark appeared indifferent; he rested his elbows on the chess-table, and buried his face in his hands, his old boy- ish position. He seemedl completely absorbed with thought that evening. Clare watched' him 'in silence a little; he appeared to be studying something. At length a sneer played about his beautiful, soft lips, and he said in a low, cutting tone,- "I see now what magnet drew you to the Institute at twelve o'clock of a bitter cold night--eh, Mark!-" Mr. Mallory unchvered his face, regarding his brother with cool composure. "A woman in the case! I've found the reading of the riddle-but you, Mark! a woman! I own I'm aston- ished; zounds!" This was said in a tone so low as to be almost a whis- per, and as clear and piercing as a knife.  * Mark Mallory regarded his brother in silence. The   86        BONOR BRTGBH. humpback grew nervous and restless under his quiet, almost indifferent gaze, and at' length, half shielding his eyes, seemed to grow drowsy and sleepy.   o Mark went to the library, and taking a book drew his chair near the table, holding the shaded light, and seemed to read. Mrs. Mallory, in the mean time, had dropped her embroidery listlessly in her lap, and was quietly-enjoying an after-dinner nap. Silence did what conversation had failed to accomplish; it roused the girl from her reverie. She glanced up and met the master's eye. Was it the silence, or the almost irresistible fascination of that eye-simply a light-blue eye, but with such strength of will, such power of execution. She did not question which. He smiled as their eyes met; had he been trying his magnetic influence on her? It was not unlike him. She returned the smile, -the expression of apathy vanishing. "I am afraid this rbom has much the same effect on you, as on Clare," he said, questioningly. "You mistake; it is pleasant to me above all the others," in earnest disclaim. He looked pleased. She was silent and troubled a little; then said with a sort of bitter gayety, - "I do not believe in spirits, you know." "You must not say that, until you audi alteram par- tem," he said a little gravely, and then added, "Have you looked into my library at all?" She shook her head; there was an eager, wistful ex- pression on her face, as if she hoped he would tell her of that alteram partemn. "You do not believe in spirits, then?" said Clare from e      , ?    eONOR BRIGHT.           87 among his cushions. He had not been sleeping, but lis- tening. "Your brother advises me not to avow scepticism on the subject until I am fully prepared to maintain my position," she replied. "Do you intend taking his advice?" it was a simple question as to its wording, but as to its tone, there was a deal of covert insinuation and sneering in it that made her uncomfortable and ill at ease, she could not explain why. She did not reply for a moment, but looked from one brother to the other, examining their faces with her keen woman's instinct, as if reading their. characters, drawing comparison, and forming her estimate. Her chief charm lay in her earnestness, her absorbtion in any subject that interested her, to the entire forgetful- ness of self. She was utterly unconscious that these two men were watching her, and knew as well as herself, that in her answer to this simple question, lay the verdict of their respective characters; aye, even more, in a certain manner her choice between them. The tone in which the question had been put implied, "Choose between us; you cannot trust both." You should have seen the two men as they waited; the one had risen and was standing indifferently before the fire, his face quiet, composed, amused--a careless observer might have said unconcerned; but the deep, questioning expression in the light-blue eyes testified to the contrary. The other had risen from his cushions, sitting erect, while his almost startling beauty was enhanced by a brilliant, feverish flush of expectancy. At length, with affected nonchalence, he said, "You do not answer. Are you going to take his advice?' The reply was short, unequivocal,-- "Yes."   88        BONWOR BRIGHT. You might have thought it unimportant, yet to these two men it was significant, full. The expression it brought to the humpback's face would have startled you, as it did Charity., He detected her almost imperceptible shudder, and instantly the beautiful, voluptuous lips were wreathed in smiles, as if to obliterate the impression he had made. Mark had not seen his brother; he was looking at this girl, with her quiet decision and dignity,:choosing between them in their very presence. A faint flush had crept up to his very brow; it did not escape Clare. He said gayly, but with that same covert sarcasm that had[ disturbed the girl before,- i  "You are right. I    admire your discrimination. Mark's advice i safe. He is an honorable mnan. Haven't you noticed he left undisturbed the old motto at the In- stitute? 'Honor Bright' still flashes in all its brazen gilt upon its ground of azure." Before any reply could be made, a servant announced two gentlemen. Mr. Mallory directed them to be shown there. Charity arose and was leaving the room;, as she passed him, he laid his hand detainingly on her arm, say- ing,-  "  Stay."   She yielded implicit obedience, as those who came within Mark Mallory's influence were wont to.     - Just at that moment, Mr. Hammond and the Principal of the old Institute, Mr. Selden, entered. They looked astonished at seeing the young girl; but greeted her heartily, congratulating her on her recovery, and looking curiously at the new owner. But Mr. Mallory was a man not apt to be troubled    with impertinences, so their questions expended them-    selves in looks only.   EONOR BRBIST.          89 Clare and Mr. Selden appeared to be old friends. They were soon in conversation; whilst Mr. Mallory seemed more bored than entertained by Mr. Hammond. Mrs. Mallory, aroused by their entrance, took her part in the conversation. Charity alone was a quiet listener. She was seated a little apart from the others. After aOwhile, Selden came over and sat beside her. As he has his part in our story^ let us tell you a little of the man. His figure was small and slight,' almost puny. He had a large, well-developed head in point of intellect, though the moral bumps were in a large measure de- pressed. His face graduated from a broad brow to a small, pointed, and receding chin. His complexion was bilious, his features good, his mouth-that outward sign of the inward man- was well-shaped and small, had thin, finely-cut lips, with a certain meek, yielding ex- pression to them. A look of indecision and pliability, an openness to influence. In looking at the man, you would have said, his chief fault was pusillanimity. As he seated himself by the. young girl, he did it with a conciliatory air, as if courting her good opinion; there was a certain unmistakable devotion in his manner, too. He loved this girl. Had done so for years. .She, with her woman's heart, knew it, and drew back from him with an aversion that amounted to positive repulsion. "I am so glad to see you well. I am afraid you have felt hard toward me for leaving the Institute; but I have a constitutional horror of suffering, and we cannot be blamed for what our mothers give us," he said with hes- itancy. It is easy to shift our failings and our weaknesses on our mothers. Proneness to crime inherited, - forsooth!   90        HOnOR BRIGHT,. The girl made no reply, save what a curl of the lip ex- pressed. He flushed, saying in a deprecating tone,-  "Charity, you cannot believe but what I have been   i distressed."                      i "I do not doubt it for an instant, Mr. Selden," with inimitable scorn.  He knawed his thin nether lip in silence for a little;  then utterly ignored the past, making no effort to refer to it again, but talking on subjects of general interest. At length he broached the present, in an apologetical tone, as if personal remarks might be disagreeable. "My old friend, Clare, tells me you are to be his amanuensis." She nodded assent. "I am very glad. You will find it a pleasant task. I performed it myself once, for three years." She looked a trifle astonished. He seemed delighted to have awakened her interest; so continued in that vein, i "Yes, I was in the family three years. I left years ago, when I came here, I suppose I should have been there yet, only - " He stopped suddenly, and appeared confused, as if he hai been saying something he should not. Charity looked at him in amazement. He discovered her wonderment, and grew still more confused, glancing, stealthily over at Clare. Charity unconsciously followed his glance. Again the humpback's face made her start. That face so remarkably beautiful, but so inexplicable to her. Now it was wreathed in smiles, but beneath them gleamed a hideous, threatening expression, as one catches glimpses of spots and blemishes beneath a beautifying vail. *          I '    OSONOR BRIGrT.          91 Selden's embarrassment, as he met these smiles, was pitiable. He changed the subject in an abrupt, bungling fashion. "What a palace of a place this is. You will like it better every day." 'She did not even hear him, but was puzzling over the expression on that beautiful, dazzling face, and the effect it had had on this man. "Was there anything between them? It was nothing to her if there was;" still it in- terested her. Selden was striving sedulously to divert her attention from his previous remark. "This place is like its master. Everything shows his touch. He is a wonderful fellow. His talent for business is incredible. It fairly takes my breath away. He has made millions, and is only thirty-five. He seems to have the magical power of turning everything he touches into gold. One would really think he had fleeced the golden sheep the Argonauts sought, or plucked the golden apples of the Hesperides," looking about admiringly; then adding, - "Who would dream this was the old, shabby library; you will grow so accustomed'to wealth, you will not know how to live without it, eh, Charity?" with: a tone of disturbed inquiry in his voice. She did not seem to consider his question worth an- swering, but made some remark wide of the subject. He soon came bacJk to personal conversation, however. "Mallory is a good fellow. He got me position of principal here, and since the dissolution of the Institute, has set me up in law. I had started for that, when a lad." There was something deprecating in his tone, as if he owed it to the master to praise him, and underrate him-   92       HEONOR BRIGHT. self. Charity noticed this peculiarity, but did not under- stand its cause. How could she, since she had not the charmed " open sesame " to the mystery? All this time Clare was watching them from his lounge. His persistent gaze annoyed Charity. She was relieved when, after a while, the conversation became general. Then Mr. Ham- mond glanced at his watch. "Bless my soul, Selden! we have infringed unpardon- ably on the requirements of etiquette. We have made our first call a two hours affair. We crave your gracious leniency for the misdemeanor. It is all owing to the fascinations of this charming place,"-with his usual grand- iloquent volubility, and bowing to the ladies, in his puffy way. Mrs. Mallory, with true courtesy, waved all apology, inviting them to call again. When they were gone, she rolled up her work, and saying, "good-night," left the room. Charity arose to follow. When she reached the door, Clare called her. "Sir," stopping to listen. "Will you please come where I can see you; I want to speak to you." She did as requested, coming over directly in front of his lounge, leaning on the back of a .gothic chair, in an attentive position. Mr. Mallory was standing, his arm resting on the mantel-piece. He wore that same troubled, preoccupied expression, that had never left his face thb entire evening. Clare let her stand in silence for a minute; then said,- "You have made one decision to-night,"-- with bitter gayety,- " now, Iwant you to make another; then, every- thing being settled, we can take up the routine of daily life, and consider ourselves a family." Mark looked questioningly at his brother, evidently   aONOR BRHT.          . 93 amused at his preamble. There was something fascinat- ing in Mark Mallory's amused expression; you could not discover where it was, or what play of feature gave it birth; eye and lip were grave. Youfelt rather than saw it. The young girl said, "Well," inquiringly. There was  a touch of impatience in her tone, too; she looked white and tired with the day's exertion. Clare went on. "You are, of course, aware of the fact, that two eld- est sons is an impossibility, since we are not twins. Also, it would be confusing for Mark and I both to be called Mr. Mallory. Now, which of us is to have his Christian name from those gracious lips? '  She paid no heed to the delicate compliment, but said with slight dignity, - "Since you must not both be Mr. Mallory, I shall call youj Clare, of course." The name was spoken very frankly, without the slightest hesitancy. The humpback flushed with' triumph; Mr. Mallory asked, with that same air of quiet amusement,- "'"Why?"                i "Render a woman's reason, and answer ' because'," suggested Clare, his beautiful lips parted with his most insinuating, tempting smile. "I will tpll you whiy, just to refute your implied charge," she said. "That is woman-like, too," gayly. She paid no attention, but looking at Mr. Mallory, replied to his question,-- "Because he's the younger." Clare looked disappointed. "Is that the only reason?" questioned Mr. Mallory,   "       H EONOR BRIGHT.  his keen blue eyes fastened on her face; she colored, but said "; no " very frankly. Clare evidently put a flattering interpretation on her words; he laughed merrily, glancing in triumph at his brother; then arose, holding out his hand for Charity's, i saying, -  "Allow me to escort you to the foot of the stairs." "Permit me to detain you for a moment; II-do not consider that I have had an answer," said Mr. Mallory quietly. She declined Clare's hand with a graceful little nod of dissent, leaning still on the back of the chair, and look- ing at Mr. Mallory doubtingly. Clare flushed angrily at the polite refusal, and left the room without saying good-night. "Are you not going to tell me," questioningly. "You will not understand me if I do." "A doubtful compliment to my comprehension," in an amused tone, and waiting. There was some strange fascination in the force of this man's will; one yielded to it unconsciously. Charity never thought to refuse the answer he asked; she only was at a loss to express her thought; when she did, it was with hesitancy. "Because you have done so much for me, besides- " He interrupted her bitterly. "Gratitude again." "I knew you would misinterpret," she said in a vexed, almost angry tone. "Pardon me; i interrupted you," he said quietly; "you were saying besides-- Is there any other reason why I must be Mr. Mallory, not Mark?" "Yes," slowly, thoughtfully. "May I know it?" looking interested.   1ONOR BRIrGHT.         95 "No, for I do not even know it myself, but, only feel it," with a sort of vague wonderment in her tone. He looked amused. "'If the reason ever becomes tangible, will you tell me?" She laughed, but colored a little withal, saying-- "( You would be sure to misinterpret it." She interested him; her frank fearlessness, her entire independence of, thought and word. He came over and stood beside her, saying, - "I wonder shall we ever understand each other." She looked up into his face in her earnest way, say- ing-    , - ("We will learn each other."  He smiled. i' As she was passing through the hall she glanced into the room we have described as Clare's study. The humpback was reclining on the lounge--she caught his eye for an instant; he' did not speak, bat put his hand gallantly to his lips, gracefully tossing her a kiss; she bowed coldly and went up to her room. a,    96         HONOR BBIB. .

AFTER that each fell naturally into his own niche. ' Mr. Mallory was seldom at home, excepting in the even- , ing; he seemed entirely absorbed in business.  Charity    X wrote out Clare's thoughts, which, in their strange, weird fascination, wielded mighty influence, not only over the amanuensis, but over the world; for every author, either     in great or small measure, controls the minds and gov- erms the actions of his readers. Clare Mallory's powers    i were unusual;' his mind was prolific, his imagination-  lofty, his erudition great; his style was original; :his selections of subjects peculiar. , He had the wonderful power of convincing his readers of the truth of the opin- ions he advanced, clothing them with such beautiful lan- guage, firing-their imaginations by his imagery and met- aphors, that they never stopped to reason out the falsity thus glossed over. Mrs. Mallory spent her time embroidering, and winning the hearts of alls about her by her gentleness, whilst old Reliable, as housekeeper, made good her- name.    They had had many calls from the aristocracy of the town'and surrounding country.   Some prompted by a kindly, neigh- borly feeling, but the majority by curiosity. Mr. Ham- mond was often at the house, and Selden spent the greater number of his evenings there. v .             /   HONOR BRIGHT.          97 So a month had passed.   It seemed an eternity to Charity; as the time following any great change in our lives always seems to multiply itself by its infinite variety. Her nineteen years had been a monotonous routine of labor and study, with endless deprivations and physical suffering: now, her life was one of luxury and ease. She wrote whenever Clare's whimsical humor dictated, but he woas not strong, and three hours a day covered the task; the rest of the time was her own: she devoted it to books. The girl was seeking to know the truth; she searched for it sedulously. Little by little, she was learn- ing "alteram  partem "Volney, Tom Paine, Hume, and many others of the class she had been familiar with from childhood; now, Paley, Butler, and, above all, the Bible, were read with avidity. She regained strength slowly, the mental excitement under which she constantly labored, deterring recovery. The month had-been full of both sorrow and pleasure: that time of unconsciousness, and the weeks of little better that had followed, seemed to remove the old life far away into the distant past, and had wielded its mer- ciful, softening influence on her grief; whilst the strong vitality of youth, the hope, the promise that fills our early years, made her take up the new life with courage, even with a certain joy. Had she been able to satisfy herself as to what was truth, even " the truth that maketh free " from doubt and uncertainty, the girl would have been comparatively content. Old Reliable "had made her decision, and meant to abide by it," as she told Charity: the girl was glad for her, but the woman's choice could not affect her, with her strong, self-dependent nature; she must examine and draw conclusions for herself. It was afternoon; the girl was in her own room. Old 2   98        HONOR BRIGHT. Reliable entered; the woman stood regarding her in silence for a little, her scroll-like mouth somewhat de- a pressed at the corners; the girl was utterly unconscious of her presence. She sat with her hand supporting her head, as if the position was more a necessity than a habit,  and perusing a volume. "Charity," in her clear, shrill voice. The girl glanced up.. "When did you come in, Reliable?" The, woman seemed too much absorbed with another    thought to heed the question.              1 "It isn't right, child I " "What is the antecedent of ' it,' Reliable?" smiling. "It is no laughing matter, child," earnestly; "you read too much. It takes too much to convince you. The Bible alone did it for me; " in a softened tone, and push- ing her double spectacles hastily up on her forehead, too proud to let the girl see her wipe the gathered mist from them. Charity, with true deJicacy, feigned unconsciousness, saying,-    - "You are clearer headed than I, Reliable; besides--" "No such thing," interrupted the woman sharply. "It's only that you have done away with your first im- pressions. They are the only ones to be trusted; you have done away with them by over-reading." ' The girl looked curious and troubled.  "Well, then, I must abide the result. I would not give much for an impression that would not bear investi- gation, like a footlprint in the sand, which the first wave  obliterates," sarcastically. The woman sighed; for an instant there was silence;  then she said in her decided way,--   HONOR BRIGHT.          99 "Throw all this trash to one side, and cling to the Bible," glancing at the volume in the girl's hand. "I can't, Reliable; like mother Eve,- if there ever was such an individuals-the very fact of this being forbidden, makes it the more tempting."5 It was a work on Pantheism, one of Spinosa's. "Must you needs know every belief in order to discover the true one," sharply. She nodded assent, almost sadly. "You'll lose yourself, then," adjusting both pair of glasses hastily on her turned-up nose, and looking at the girl, half in displeasure, half in remonstrance; ( you will, . Charity. If you run to everybody else to know what they think, how in the world will you have any mind of your own?" The girl started; she had not thought of that before. She had gloried in her vaunted independence, never real- izing that though she had asked aid of no living being, like a ship without a rudder, she had been veering about with every contrary wind of doctrine, leaning entirely on the opinions of others: thus nearly wrecked in a sea of doubt and distrust. The woman had hit the nail upon the head; with her clear discrimination she discerned it, and, guided by her knowledge of the girl's nature, she left her to drive it firm herself, turning in her blunt, abrupt fashion and leaving the room. Charity, accustomed to her manners, scarce noticed her exit; her earnest face betokened deep thought, her head resting wearily on one hand, the other leaning languidly on the unopen book in her lap. She sat thus until the twilight gathered, then arose; as she did so, the forgotten volume fell to the floor; she stooped and picked it up, looking at it in indecision for a moment, then cast it aside and left the room. +          .     .   100       HONORt BRIGHT. Each pendant lamp held its light; the corridors were flooded with their soft-tinted effulgence,-some  j of a roseate hue, some of blue, others of purple. She sought the old library; it too, was lighted, dis- pelling the gathering dusk of night. Mr. Mallory was  there, standing before the fire, his back to the door. i Charity, in .her absent mood, did not discover him un-  til she was fairly in the room; then she drew back for fear of intrusion, and was silently leaving, since he had not seen her. He spoke her name, without turning.   $i "Sir!" standing still in the door-way.  ' "Come back. If it is necessary that either should   X leave, I am the one to do so, since th/s is your room, ' still without turning.                 ' She colored violently, but made no move to obey. He turned and faced her with an air of quiet humor,  , and saw her flushed and annoyed.            ! "Well?" in an astonished tone.  "I am sorry I have so monopolized the room as to call  forth that remark," a little haughtily. He laughed.                      i "Another misunderstanding, and all our pride and dignity in arms," lightlyA and then adding,--  "Why, child, I had this room prepared especially for you..' She colored painfully, and essayed to speak, but he interrupted her, saying with a sort of gay irony, -  "Our conversation promises to be very brilliant and  Al absorbing, with this distance between us." She came into .the room at that. He placed a chair   for her so near to the place where he stood, that in talk- Ad ing to him she was obliged to look up. He seemed to like to see her with her eyes raised. For a little he  stood, regarding first the girl, then the picture over the   HONOR BRIGHT.         101 mantel-piece, in 'his cool, critical way. It annoyed her. She bore it for some minutes; then asked him bluntly why he did it. "You do not know?" looking at her incredulously. "No, sir," her voice full of mingled curiosity and vex- ation at the implied doubt. He laughed. "Why, you unsophisticated child." "I am not supposed to know your thoughts," im- patiently chafing at the humor she did not understand. He waved the subject without further comment, a graceful, though imperious way he had. At that the girl looked absently, into the fire. Her face wore a tired, unsatisfied expression, a look of longing and vague un- rest. He-seemed to read her thoughts. "You have not decided yet."  It was an assertion, not a question. She glanced up, not comprehending him; as soon as she met his eye, she discovered his meaning. ' How did he know her thoughts, how discern her strug- gle? The subject -had never been broached since that first night, when she had chosen between him and Clare." He smiled at the wonder in her face, saying quietly, - "You have cultivated your reason to the detriment of your instinct." "Well," as if she wished him to fill out the diagram of his thought. "Instinct is always true-reason often perverted." "That is what Reliable said, only in different words," thoughtfully, and looking into the fire again. "What did he believe ;,he had never told her;" her face was full of indecision, pride and woman's imperative cry for help contending. The latter conquered; she   102       HONOR, BRIGHT.  looked up, the question in her eyes; ere she could frame it E in words, it was answered by a cold non-committal smile.  It was the first time she had ever asked help; it had been denied. Was he unable to aid her? had he spoken  S from experience, when he had said instinct could be lost in reason, and reason be perverted until right was inex- tricably fused in wrong? or was it a selfish interest in. seeing her utterly dependent on self?  Her face was full of disappointment; she could not un-  derstand him. Why had he answered her thus? Did, he believe in God? 'What was it to her what he  believed? and yet, though in her pride she would not  admit it, his belief to her was of vital importance. In her enervated state, she had searched and studied until f she had weakened her own judgment; his was clear and  B; strong; she thought he could direct her; she almost longed, in her bewilderment, that he would decide for  her. She looked distressed; her face wore Ma weary, spent ! expression too. He laid his hand lightly on her brow; it was feverish. At the touch of that cool, quiet hand the f blood rushed to her very temples. He looked amused. "What a strange girl you are," he said with a light laugh, and withdrawing his hand; then adding, --  "Your head is too hot by far for you to form a cool, 1 unbiassed decision. Give over the effort for to-night." The color died'away; she shook her head. "Do you know I have been waiting a whole month for you to make a request of me?" changing the subject.  She looked puzzled. "My organ has not been open since." "Oh, sir, I have thought of it so often," earnestly. "Why did you not tell me so, then? I have felt any- thing but complimented," lightly. She could not tell him how her great sense of obliga-    HONOR BRIGHT.         103' tion utterly precluded the idea of asking from him even the smallest favor; so was mute.       v "You have not even asked me now," with whimsical humor. He seemed determined to make her put that request at least into words. She colored, and hesitated a moment with slight em- barrassment; then said with her customary grace and with a bit of a smile at his persistence,- "May I have the pleasure now?" He stood regarding her in silence. This strange, self- possessed girl, all her life shut off from the world, yet having a quiet dignity of manner, that any woman of society might have emulated. Then with a smile he drew her hand within his arm, and led her to his music, room. Mark Mallory's music had in it the power of genius; his touch was that of the master; the whole building was filled with its grandeur and beauty. He played portions of Handel's Messiah, snatches from oratorios and nocturnes, some of Beethoven's dreamy strains, and airs from the grand old German composers. The girl sat where he had placed her, that he might watch its effect, but his object was unconsciously thwart- ed; she had shielded her face with one hand; the other lay in her lap; white, nervous, and with quickning pulse, almost trembling with excess of feeling. She did not go into raptures, as girls generally do; he would have been disappointed if she had. She was per- fectly mute; had it not beers for the nervous, character- istic hands, one might have said she was apathetical. He watched her with an interest that trenched on fas- cination, this anomaly ever disclosing some new phase. He blended one grand strain into another, his own ver- satile powers improvising the interludes. At length, , .   104       fONOR BRIGHT. with one of those flights of ineffable sweetness, the music died. She did not move. He waited a moment; then went     I over and stood beside her, laying his hand questioningly on her bright hair. She looked up at that, and said,   i "Thank you,"- nothing more; but it was enough;,  the face revealed, glorified by the power of music, was the perfect face of Beatrice. Was it impulse, or soul meeting soul? the man stooped and kissed her brow. She did not even color or so much as change expression, save to smile. It was not a man  0 pressing lips of love to a woman's brow, but spirit claim- ! ing and spirit yielding. In the silence that followed you i: could have heard each heart beat --aye, even each vibra-  tion 'of the air, had you listened. The soul of music, seemed laid bare in its unsullied purity; the very silence I was vocal.  She was the first to break the spell, doing it with a lit- tie start, like one awaking from a dream. "Mr. Mallory, have you all your life been doingsome- thing for somebody?" she asked in a low, wondering tone. "I do nothing for anybody," was the quiet disclaim. , "I am a living proof to the contrary," she said, with a  little incredulous laugh.     . "You mistake; I have never done anything for you," looking amused at her mystified air. "  i . "Let me contradict you.  Setting everything else aside, you have given me the truest, purest enjoyment of my life, just now."                    He wheeled a sleepy-hollow up before her, and sank - into it with a sort of lazy grace, ere he replied; then said, in a polemic tone, as if inviting argument, - "I again assert that I have done nothing whatever for you."

"I will explain, and try and make my, meaning lucid. I do not acknowledge the existence of any such quality as unselfishness. The idea is simply an abstract one, in- capable of being made real. Disinterestedness, so-called, is none other thani refined selfishness. Every appar- ently liberal act, has rise in a latent desire to gratify self.' His keen, cold philosophy troubled her, she showed it. "I acknowledge I am unequal to argument to-night, save by the simple means of illustration;' pray accept it. Two - a man and a woman - were breasting a chilling win- ter wind. They were strangers to each other. The man was richly, warmly clad; the woman was cold; he took his fur-collar from his throat to meet her want. Find me the selfish motive there." He was watching her in silence --this girl, with her quiet, unostentatious pride. "A man and a woman." Perfect equality, without regard to wealth and station or poverty, meeting oha that broad platform of manhood and womanhood.  She thought his silence signified defeat; so said, a little triumphantly, - "You cannot refute it." "Pardon, but I can, knowing the circumstances of the case. The man's motive was one of pure, unqualified selfishness., The girl, with her stoical nature, interested him.  He) had seen her bear the cruelty of nature without murmur; how would she treat a kindness from a human being.  It was to gratify curiosity as to her. character, to indulge an impulse that promised pleasure to this same self, rather than to relieve her suffering."   106       HONO    BRIGHT, H, His defence, cold, convincing, and trenchant as steel, both fascinated while it troubled her. In her earnest- ness she elapsed her hands nervously, and leant for- ward in her chair.            , "You chill me with your heartless philosophy. Oh! do not, I entreat, destroy the little faith, the little trust I have!" He smiled - a cold, quiet smile; and, leaning forward,  took both the troubled hands in his. She attempted to draw them away, exclaiming, in a voice of mingled defi- ance and smothered anguish,- - "No, you shall snot soothe me with your strong will,  i your almost magnetic power. It would be like lulling one to sleep at the mouth of a crater, or yielding to the delusive. sleep of the freezing!" shuddering.      SA He dropped her hands instantly, and leant back in his  chair, proud and immobile. She buried her face in the hands thus released,  ' How full, how versatile in its emotions is silence. But ! a moment before it was fraught with music, holiness, peace; now it trembled and quivered with the excess of  E passion and pain. It was not more than five little .min-  j utes, yet it seemed so very long.        . The hands revealed the face, no longer the peaceful face of Beatrice, but white, and with tense lines about eye and lip. She met his eyes - those light-blue eyes, cold, quiet, and apparently indifferent. "I have offended you," she said, in a low, constrained  " voice. He did not contradict her.                l "Pray forgive me! I was unreasonable, unkind. You had saved me from one death; I was angry that you. could not save me from another, and worse;" her voice was passive in the intensity of its anguish.   HONORt BRIGHT.         107, She had made a god of him, and demanded life for. her soul of his hands'; she had found him a man,- cold, cynical, passionless;, apparently a creature of simply reason and will; or, if he had heart, passion, feeling, he kept them controlled, concealed by the fierce grip of his iron will. And he read her thought. V "You are disappointed?" with a bitter laugh, "Yes," frankly. He smiled. There was a charm in her truthfulness. ( Are we to be friends?" "No, we cannot. We should never agree. It is not a possibility. Friendship implies sympathy, and common interest, and -" 'hesitating "Confidence," he supplied the word. She nodded assent, with her accustomed candor; then continued,-       o "Your nature, your opinions, preclude every idea of your ever being a friend to any one." "Not my nature, nor my opinions. Be brave; call the obstacle by the right name; say my selfishness," he said, sarcastically. She looked troubled. "Since not friends, then what?" coolly. . "What?" she repeated after him questioningly. He smiled. "Shall I tell you, what alone my nature admits of in regard to you." "Yes," with a look of questioning wonder. The man's face worked as in agony; he covered it from her sight. But an instant before she had thought him incapable of feeling. Now some deep emotion, conquer- ing even his pride, had wrung his heart until the struggle was depicted on his usually immobile face, and she fairly trembled in its presence. When he uncovered his face, jll   108       HONOR BR1GHT. it was that of a man who has fought a battle and won. The lips were set and hard; the blue eyes fairly black in their intensity; the brow mroist and pale- he wiped it hastily, and changed the subject. She looked perplexed, . 1 troubled. At that moment Mrs. Mallory entered; he  seemed relieved, and instantly was himself again. She    went over and stood at the back of her son's chair.-  "Come, children, dinner is ready. Did you not hear   : the bell?"?t He leaned back, looking up into her face. "No, mother; did it ring?"?  She stroked his hair from his brow with her gentle hand. "Why, yes; three times; and Charity needs nourish- ment, I know, for she is as white as a ghost."  He glanced at the young girl; then looking up into his :: mother's face again, said, exegetically,-  "It is not lack of food has made her white, but that I  have been troubling her. We have been quarrelling; that ?; is all."                         :/ Mark Mallory's face whenever he addressed his mother   : would have won any woman's heart. She stooped and    ?: kissed his brow, saying incredulously, -   : "Quarrelling?" as if it were an utter impossibility for any one to quarrel with him.                i He laughed so merrily at the tone, that Charity could   not but join it. , "You see, my mother does not like you to think me an egregious tyrant," he said; then rising, gave one    1 arm to his mother, the other to the young girl, and   i] led them to the dining-room. To reach it they were obliged to cross the main hall, with its eight fretted   d arches. Their way led beyond the main and grandest, with its "Honor Bright'? gilt in its azure ground.   IO NOR .BRIGMH.        109 Charity saw him  glance at it; then his eyes met hers , with an expression that she did not understand. He said in a constrained hard voice,- "I have retained your old motto, you see#" CRAPTER IX. O O my lord, beware of jealousy " OTHELLO. "And hence one master passion in the breast, Like Aaron's serpent, swallows up the rest." POPE. AFTER dinner they were all in the drawing-room. Clare was teaching Charity to play chess. Mr. Mallory was watchinga them. He did not look well; was pale, with tense lines about eye and lip. Mrs. Mallory, with true mother's eyes, discovered it. "What is the matter, Mark? you are ill, I fear,' she said anxiously. "'Mark Mallory ill! that would be an event.   Our lord of creation, who has never felt the hand of any person or thing, to show the touch of pain, forsooth!" said Clare gayly, but with a certain covert jealousy. Mark, however, only heard the raillery in the tone. His mother, though, with woman's instinct, discerned the other, and looked troubled. Her gentle, peaceful face often wore that expression of vague foreboding and distress, when in the presence of her two sons. Charity; with the others, looked at Mr. Mallory. He was white, she thought sad, too; and her thought was in 10   "O       HONOR BRIGHT. -her eyes as his met them; thus naturally he made his answer to her, - "Headache--nothing more.  It makes me wretched company, though, so I will say good-night," and as he spoke, he arose and left the room. His mother followed him. Clare looked after them, with that strange, bright gleanm in his great lustrous eyes, and muttered in a bitter undertone, as if forgetting Charity's presence,-  "I' have headache every day; he has it once, .and mother looks foolishy anxious. It has always been so; everybody falls at his feet, and I am spurned and cast to one side.",' Charity was regarding him in mute surprise.  His beautiful, wondrous face, writhing with those bitterest of all pangs, jealousy. He glanced up and caught her ex- pression. "Even you choose him before me. Doubtless it was this damning hump. It turned you against me, as it does every other," with terrible bitterness, and sweeping aside his long wavy hair the more fully to expose it. -"It is no fault of mine. I was born so. My mother gave it me; sometimes I have hated her for it! I was cursed before I was born." Charity fairly trembled; his face was white as death; the perfect features distorted by his uncontrolled passion. He saw her frightened, and softened his tone, saying with quiet insinuation, - "Deformities are not always physical, and thus readily discerned; there are spiritual contortions as well. I could lay my finger on a man who carries as great a hump on his soul, as I do on my back." "A stab in the dark," at whom was it aimed? she could not but guess. She held in utter contempt the cowardly hand that had given it. Yet it left its uncomfortable   HONOR BRIGHT.          Il impression. So great, so insidious, too, is the power of inuendo. X To the girl's infinite relief, at that moment Mr. Ham- mond and Mr. Selden were ushered in. Charity was about to sweep the men from the board, but Clare deterred her. He was himself again; and said,- "I own I am intensely interested in the result of this game. Hammond will excuse us, I am confident." fMr. Hammond, with customary volubility, declared that "nothing could afford him such unmitigated enjoyment, such unalloyed pleasure, as contemplating the contest be- tween his highly talented friend and his fair opponent;" whilst Selden drew up a chair, also, to watch the players. Clare had ignored his presence entirely. He treated the man strangely. Sometimes he was patronizing and con- descending; sometimes insultingly oblivious of his exist- ence. The man appeared to have an unpleasant effect on him,-as if calling up something hateful in the past. Selden bore patiently his caprice, though at times there was an expression amounting to hate about his thin, weak, facile lips. The two puzzled Charity. With her astute observation she could not but notice that some peculiar relation ex- isted between them. , What was it? No one seemed to discover it but herself. Perhaps it was simply her im- agination. Some natures were essentially antagonistic. Perhaps she was making a mystery of what was only the natural- effect of a natural cause. Of one thing, though, she was convinced. These two men, either with or without a reason, were not the friends they sought to appear. Clare, having only a novice to contend with, could maintain the conversation and play at the same time; so there was a steady stream of talk. The topics of in-   "2       HONOR BRIGHT L terest in the town were discussed; the' general news, politics, religion, amusement, each were touched on.    ! The last periodicals were criticised; this erudite essay;  i that pungent, witty article, -whilst Clare's contributions always came in for their share of almost fulsome praise from the two gentlemen.                   Flattery, to Clare Mallory, was as exhilarating as new   wine; his spirits effervesced and sparkled 'neath its scin- tillating effects. He charmed his hearers with his bril- liant conversation, his flights of eloquence, his bursts of a sarcasm, and his ready, irresistible wit, carrying them from one topic to another with wondrous fascination. Charity continually forgot her move; absorbed in his converse, at such times, his cheeks would burn, his eyes grow brilliant with delight; he would recall her wander-  : ing attention, with a look of such evident triumph and    fondness, that though she did not more than half under-   stand it, she could not help but color and feel annoyed.  Each of these times Selden gnawed his thin nether      lip, looking both alarmed and angry. Once these mingled   expressions were so palpable, that Mr. Hammond dis-     covered it, and made a remark to that effect. When he   did so, Selden seemed to shrivel up in himself, and grow fairly ghastly, whilst Clare said with a withering sneer, X i "You look pale to-night, Selden; is it the old malady?" "Why, Selden, I did not know that you were troubled with any chronic affection. Pray, which is the diseased organ?" questioned Mr. Hammond, in a tone of sur- prised concern.                       , At that, Clare made the room fairly ring with his elfish laughter. Charity looked from one to the other in mute astonishment. Clare caught the expression, and explained. "Selden was left to fill a position of trust once, and  i i   HONOR BRI0GT.          113 failed signally. Since then, any recurrence to it always affects him thus," pointing at him with one of his long white fingers, and an almost demenaical expression gleam- ing through his startlingly beautiful mask. "Eh, Bel- den?" The man fairly shivered beneath that tone. Charity grew restless in the presence of this thing which she could not understand; this covered thing, from which each seemed threatening to throw aside the screen-- this thing that had fully confirmed her in her suspicion of some- thing existing between these two men. Was any other implicated? Unconsciously she thought of that spiritual deformity, that hideous hump upon a soul, which Clare had described. She shuddered, and in that shudder, un- wittingly acknowledged the existence of that very thing which for years she had scoffed at--the soul. It was no longer reason, will, but soul; and in admitting the exist- ence of that soul, she necessarily acknowledged its im- mortality; for soul and eternity are indissolubly united. Mr. Hammond was looking from one to the other, with a blank, stupid air. At length he said, in an apologetic tone,- "Your pardon, highly gifted sir, but I do not quite discern the connecting link between your wonderfully pithy remark, and my most unworthy question. Doubt- less it is all owing to my obtuse comprehension." "Not at all! nott at all; you may well say with Pope,- 'egad! I think the interpreter is harder to be under- stood of the two.' Doubtless it borders on: the riddle. Selden, perhaps, will read you the answer some time. Eh, Selden?" The tone had an almost fiendish ring. Selden only shook his head, and Clare with a smile of winning sweet- ness, and an expression about his sensual lips that made 10*    "4:      HONOR BBIGHT. the girl recoil, recalled her attention to the game. She made repeated ill moves, so completely had this little in- comprehensible episode disturbed her. Mr. Hammond seemed unable to regain his interest also; he sat regard- ing Selden with a dazed expression, and rubbing his double chin with his great fat hands, as if the perplexity all lay there. At length he brightened up,- "There, I know what has been bothering me; your looking so alabaster-like made me think of something,. Selden, and I could not tell what. It's a little incident I'll take occasion to relate." "Selden, you've been for the last ten minutes the whitest person I ever saw whose blood still eieulated. I do not doubt but that it's all owing to your old malady, which our highly-talented and prodigiously-admired friend com- mented on, though I must humbly affirm I have been with you constantly for four years, and did not suspect you suf- fered from any such. I admire your stoical endurance. But to return to the incident. It was to me slightly ap- palling. I met with it on my way whilst coming after you, Selden. I took the short cut through that little grove that shuts my place off from the place belonging to the estimable family with whom you board. When I reached the hither side, ahead of me, about forty paces on the open road, I saw a female figure clad in black. I probably should not have noticed her, had not the white ground of snow brought her sombre outline into bold relief. She was walking rapidly in the direction of ' the Institute.' Your pardon, gracious sir, I should say, this grand oriental palace," glancing at Clare, who held a knight idly suspended, his beautiful face wearing an ex- pression of startled, eager attention. Mr. Hammond, charmed with the mark of what he in-   HONOR BRIGHT.         115 terpreted respect, and delighted with the interest he had awakened, continued,-      - ' "Thinking it unaccountable and strange that a female should be alone and unprotected in so desolate a section of country at night, seeing as females are generally timid, I quickened my pace, thinking I might be able to ren- der her some insignificant service. She did not seem to hear me approach. I came on her suddenly. By all the devils Christians pretend to believe in, I was scared; she was as white as the snow at her feet, only more the the color of the dead. A little thing, with coal-black hair, and such eyes as she turned on me!-I'll never scoff at spimitns aga'n! -- they were dark and deep as 'Hades.' She only stood an instant, then turned and fled into the woods. I gaped and rubbed mine eyes, to be sure I had not been, dreaming, or that it was not an optical illusion. But the greatest part is, I thought of her when you grew so white, Selden, and if I properly recall my sensation, I thought of you when starting after her," with a stupid, perplexed air, and rub- bing his chin very hard. Charity started up with a cry of alarm, over-throwing the chess-table. Clare had fallen back upon the lounge insensible. "What is the matter?  Is he -in a fit? or dead? or what? what did it?" cried Mr. Hammond, dazed and, bewildered, and making no offer of aid. Charity turned to where Selden had sat; he was gone. "Stay with him," she said in an imperative tone to Mr. Hammond; then ran quickly from the room. She did not seek his mother; some intuitive in- stinct forbade her; but hastened up to old Reliable's room. A moment after, they were both bending over him, applying restoratives.   "6       HONOR BRIGHT. Mr. H-ammondj man-like, now that all necessity for assistance was over, became superfluously- efficient; his tongue too, was loosed. He began telling old Reliable just how it had all happened; " how he had been relating I a little adventure he had met with, and his lordship had [1 just reeled over, without giving the slightest warning.  1 To be sure, the gifted gentleman could not help it, but it would undoubtedly have. been more considerate had   ! he just thrown out a hint as to his intentions." Reliable was chafing the limbs of the insensible man,  : whilst Charity was bathing with camphor the beautiful   5 - face, white and perfect now as a thing of marble.

A school-boy wouldn't have been scared at such a tale. Doubtless, he is subject to fainting spells; he is just the build for it," pointing significantly at the deformed shoulders. Under her vigorous treatment, the heart renewed its beating, the pulse its throb. The man began to revive. Old Reliable adjusted both pairs of glasses, and ceased her work to watch the return  of consciousness. He started up. The great: eyes opened and glared around with an expression of wild horror. Charity drew back, whilst old Reliable looked with keenly awakened suspicion through her double- spectacles, and asked bluntly,- "What are you scared at?   What are you looking   ' for?              -   - HONOR BRIGHT.        117 Instantly he recovered himself, and sinking back among the cushions, asked feebly, and with well assumed indifference,- "Where is Selden?" "Oh! he ran like a coward. It's his way when there is suffering about," contemptuously, and never removing her eyes from the ghastly face. Then abruptly coming to the point,- "What made you faint?" He started nervously, the full voluptuous lips work- ing almost convulsively. "The room was so infernally hot, and is now. Can't somebody open a window?" in a virulent tone. Charity threw wide one of the casements, whilst Mr. Hammond said, with his usual inane garrulity, - "It is a source of infinite relief to my disturbed sensi- bilities, my highly-gifted friend, to have-the fact revealed that it was the unhappy temperature of 'this elegant apartment, and not the stghtlv startling incident I had been so unfortunate as to relate, which caused your tem- porary withdrawal from the world of consciousness;" rubbing the double chin with palpable disappointment at not after all having been the cause of the little sensa- tion. Clare only replied with a laugh. At that laugh there was another hieroglyphic added to old Reliable's vellum- like face. The mouth turned down at the corners; she gave a little characteristic sniff, never moving her eyes from the humpback's face. The persistency and keen- ness of her look, evidently annoyed him. "I am quite recovered, thank you;" he said haughtily, and dismissing her with a little imperious wave of the hand, The woman left the room with a very significant   "8       HONOR BRIGHT. "Humph!" Charity, with vague uneasiness, and fore- boding, was hastening to follow her. Clare stopped her.

She came back, but not paying any heed to the out- stretched hand, raised the fallen chess-table, gatheringli up the scattered knights, castles, and so forth, blushing uncomfortably beneath the eyes he bent on her mean-  while; "You spurn even my gratitude," in a hurt tone. "You owe me none; it was Reliable brought you to,"  with a certain cold dignity.  The fierce March wind was making the apartment very cold.

SURHTX w.  IT was long ere Charity slept, that night. A strange foreboding, a vague prescience of something evil dis- turbed her. In the darkness continually she saw the beautiful face of Clare Mallory, with those dark, vivid, amorous eyes, those soft, voluptuous lips, and in the see- ing she shuddered. She intuitively feared, aye! almost hated the humpback.  Why could she not banish him from her thoughts ? Was there any truth in the theory, which clothed in the fascinating language and glamor of his prolific mind, she had that day transcribed?  Was there such as spirits? Could the mind of one person so govern and control that of another, that though these might be bodily separated, the minds, or spirits, as he termed them, would still be present with each other. Mark Mallory was a Spiritual- ist. The speculation disturbed her, carrying her back into the old troubled channel. Was there a soul ?  Was there an after-life?

The girl was lost in a labrynth of doubt. Even those who acknowledged a God and immortality had no uniformity of belief. Every day some new theory; to-day still another-" "Spiritualism."

Then wrapping her dressing-gown about her, determined not to try to sleep again. She    !t went over to where she had left the volume on Pantheism    that afternoon, and picking up what she- supposed to be   j the same book, drew a chair near the light, and opened where a leaf was turned down,-- "Theology is rather a divine life, than a divine knowl-  i edge.

When she entered the dining-room, somewhat later than usual, the family were seated at breakfast; she apologized as she took her place, but Mrs; Mallory interrupted her in her kind, motherly way,-- "No need, dear; I am only glad to see you so bright; you look as if you felt quite well. Perhaps the morning has something to do with it. It is such a lovely day, and the first of April too; had you thought of that, boys?"  Mr. Mallory shook his head with a little shadow of a smile, as if remembering something pleasant. Clare made no reply. Mrs. Mallory continued,- "You have no idea what mischievous boys they were, Charity; they fairly used to turn my head with their wild pranks. Mark was even worse than Clare. That was when we lived on the dear old farm long ago, now-" There was a tone of sadness in her gentle voice, and her eyes wandered from  the face of one son to the other. The dreamy, brilliant, beautiful face of the author; the fine, noble, but troubled face of the other, with his al- most fabulous wealth.  Each was successful in the path he had chosen.  Neither was happy. The mother sighed. Mark detected the sigh, as he did every passing emotion of his mother, and glancing over, met the sad, gentle lace with a  reassuring smile. It was a bit of by play that Charity did not see, so disturbed was she with Clare's persistent gaze. He had not moved his eyes from her face since she had taken her place. At length she broke through the constraint it cast upon her, and asked Mr. * Mallory about his headache. "It is better, thank you," with a little pleased smile that she had remembered it, but his looks belied his words. "   122       HONOR BRIGHT.  The face was white and weary, as if he had not slept. Charity did not even glance at Clare, and hie had fainted the night before. It was scarce kind. His face for an instant writhed, but no one saw it. After that he entirely monopolized the conversation. Mrs. Mallory looked de- lighted, as she always did when Clare was agreeable. When the meal was concluded, the humpback slipped his hand through the young girl's arm, saying, - "The inspiration is on me now; we will do our work early to-day." She could only acquiesce, so led him to his study. The entrance to it was by stained glass doors, which were  ! always thrown open wide. It was situated opposite the   j Tnain and grandest stairway; adjacent to one of the eight  fretted archways which led into the dolmed hall,--we  mention its exact location, as it has some bearing on our " story.             , Charity took her accustomed seat at the secretary by one of the windows. Clare, as was his wont, threw him-  self upon the luxurious lounge. So whilst the hours slipped away there was the low monotonous sound as of one repeating from memory, and the noiseless gliding of a pen: over paper, whilst occasionly intervened moments   of perfect silence. At noon a servant came to the door, announcing lunch. "Serve it here," commanded Clare, without consulting   CCharity. He ate nothing, and she had been too closely confined to her task, to be hungry; so they soon resumed their labor. It was a lovely day, as Mrs. Mallory had said. The sunbeams fairly thronged in through the parted drapery; they flooded the whole room, and fell in a golden shower all over the piles of manuscript. *The girl literally wrote in among them.   HONtOR BRIGHT.         123 In those intermissions, those moments of silence, she looked longingly out at the blue sky, and at the land- scapej glad and exultant at the first foot-print of spring; for blustering old March had. gone out with the past, night, and to-day, April, that bright herald, was upon the earth with her wealth of promise. Once, in'thus glancing out, she saw Mr. Mallory pass on horseback. She drew a little envious sigh. For the next hour and a half she scarce raised her eyes from the paper. Then through the building stole the low, sweet strains of the organ, swelling in grandeur and glory until they filled the whole place. The master had returned. Idly the pen rested in the tired hand; the face was wrapped, absorbed, beautified by the wondrous power of the music. The author from amidst the luxurious cush- ions watched her. The pensive, dreamy expression he al- ways wore when composing vanished, and his face-that brilliant, startling face, almost more than humanin its  F wonderful beauty- darkened and writhed with jealousy. Then he arose and went toward the door. The unusual motion aroused her; she glanced toward him, and de- manded rather than asked, - "What are you going to do, Clare?" "Shut out that infernal noise,"in a fierce, almost demoniac tone.                  i She arose from  her seat, and faced him in all her womanly dignitjy. "Clare Mallory, leave those doors as they are.?"There I was a tone of strong iron resolve in her voice.  The humpback paused, surprised, daunted. "Why, Charity?" his countenance changing, his accents the sweetest. "Because I wish them  thus," resuming her seat as if the matter was settled.   124       EONOR BRIGBT. He did not return to his lounge, but came over and stood near her, leaning on the secretary. i' Charity, you will never allow those doors other than open. Why is it? are you afraid of me?" He would have liked it if she was; you could read it in the alluring sweetness of his tone.' She looked at him with infinite  scorn.. "Afraid of you? No!" The blood rushed to his very temples; his ripe lips   ! trembled like a child's. She. was full of remorse. She could not help but despise him for his contemptible jealousy, but it was no excuse for her cruelty. "Forgive me; I did not intend to hurt you. I was unkind," she said impulsively, laying her hand kindly on his arm. He seized it covering it, with kisses. She snatched it away angrily. l "Now you hate me again!" in a tone of mingled dispair and appeal. Then continuing passionately, "And I  II would kiss the very ground made sacred by the   j touch of your feet! I would tear out my heart and fling ! it before you, finding a more exquisite joy in your tramp- ling, than another's caressing!" His face wa, bathed and' flooded with adoration' the lips soft and pleading with love; the dark eyes vivid and eloquent; whilst above all surged the grandeur of the music., The girl- felt herself fascinated, whilst recoiling. His strange nature, his un- earthly beauty, his'talents,--all wielded their power. A moment she was passive; then the music seemed to burst into great sobs of anguish and despair. She started to her feet, with chilling hauteur,- Clare Mallory, your language is hateful to me." "( Is it a hateful thought to be the wife of a Mallory . I entreat, implore you, to be my wife," l Never!" with a shudder.   t'EONOR BRIGHT.        125 There was a terrible expression on his face. She did not heed it, but continued in a tone of bitter reproach,- "You have been unkind, selfish. You have driven me from the only home I have on earth." He fell on his knees before her, white as death, and looking up into her face in an agony of entreaty, said, "For mercy's sake do not speak so. You should pity, not censure. Was it a crime to love? Because my figure is hideous, deformed, must I forever be spurned?" The eyes filled with tears of pity and remorse. He saw his advantage and followed, - "I'll never rise from this place, until you promise me my hated love shall not drive you thence. If you but mention it, Mark will banish me. It will be I, not you, who will become homeless. Promise; and a word of this shall, never pass my lips again," with pitiable, abject entreaty. "You promise, Clare?" doubtingly. "I promise, as I hope to escape the fate of the damned," laying his hand upon his heart. She shivered; then extending her hand raised him. He was as pale as death, and reeled where he stood. "Tell me, Charity--. do you utterly hate me?" in a tone sharp with anguish. She pitied him; hate and pity could not exist together; she laid her hand with the gentle sorrowing of a sister upon his shoulder, and said very gently, "No, Clare." Then left him.

"The deepest ice that ever froze, Can only o'er the surface close; The burning stream lies quick below And flows, and cannot cease to flow." THE music had died. There was perfect silence, broken      only by her own light tread though the marble halls.      i She wandered, she scarce knew where.  Once she stoppedd at an open door that led' out into the grounds. A ser- vant had thrown them wide, to let in the soft spring air. She longed for the first time to leave this place, this place that had been her home from childhood; this place, beautiful as a Moorish temple, grand and brilliant with ; oriental splendor, reminding one of " those ceilings of vermillion and cedar," we read of in the "Arabian Nights."   She looked beyond it all to the lawn outside; the broad sweep of rolling acres, bright in the April" sun--to north and south; and directly before to the mighty hills, shutting out the world. She knew nothing of that world, with its endless turmoil; its sorrows, joys, sins. The world she had lived in was shut in between those hills on the one side and the precipitous ravine on the other. Her life, until the breaking out of the plague, had been a dull monotonous routine, destitute of incident. Often she had murmured at it; now, looking back, it seemed an Eden of love and sympathy, lost forever. Never had she   HONOR BRIGHT.         127 missed Ralph's strong, true nature as then. There was none to help in that hour of need. She was alone, utterly, terribly alone, since she knew no. God. Irl her desolation, the very sun seemed darkened; she turned from it and went in an absent sort of way to the picture gallery, as had grown her habit, when tired or weary. They were strange pictures the girl sought for rest and diversion. Not peaceful scenes of happiness, or rural beauties. Three in particular she seemed partial to. 'Joan of Arc at the stake.' The second, a wild troublous storm at sea, with the hull of a wrecked vessel tossing in the mad, dark water; the third, and the one she dwelt longest before, was a most exquisite and touching repre- sentation of the crucifixion. The death of the Son of God, with all .the attributes of the deity blended with the agony, the suffering of the human. Mr. Mallory found her before this latter, wrapped, absorbed-the bright-golden hair swept back from her brow; the dark eyes lustrous and full of a latent, unac- knowledged worship, the soul yielding all unconsciously the homage which the God-man demanded. He stood beside her, watching her for an instant; then turned away with a certain reverence that verged on awe; to this man, it was a strong, convincing evidence of divin- ity, this unconscious worship. She did not know that he was present, until she turned to leave the gallery; then she saw him at a little distance, standing with one arm resting upon a noble bust of 'Jupiter Ammon.' "Well?" he said, qrestioningly. She understood his meaning, and glancing at the heathen deity, said sadly, - "D That is what troubles me most." "To me it is the most conclusive and convincing al           '.          128        HONOR BRIGHT. argument, proving that, from all time, there has been the demand for something to worship. The heathen had their idols; the Greeks their god for every passion, every emotion; the Moors their Mahomet; the Indians their ' Great Spirit;' the Christian, the living God." She glanced at the representation of the d-ying Christ, for reply. He comprehended, and answered, -- "To believe in his existence is to recognize his Deity,  ! and deity and immortality are indissoluble." She continued looking at the picture; the dear Christ,  the great heart blieding, broken: the tender palms and feet torn, with each nerve and fibre strained, swelled, bursting, with the great agony. The holy, God-like face drooped wearily upon  the breast, and all about the glory and halo of Deity. The picture was perfect, and    t: startlingly real.                       i! The girl's heart tacitly acknowledged its Creator, its    Saviour, but her mind, perverted, contorted by ill-growth, and false theories, rebelled. She turned away sadly to     leave the gallery; he joined her, and drawing her hand     within his arm, led her, not to one of the apartments, but   to where, in one of the corridors, a casement was thrown   ': open wide, the damask drapery parted, and the after-      noon sunlight streaming in. She withdrew her hand, and leant out to catch the soft air, with its ambient sun-   light, the sumbeams gathering about, and losing their identity in her bright hair. He was watching her, and from his face you might see the picture pleased even his critical eyes. Her tall, slight figure, clad in deep, unrelieved mourning; her sunny hair; her fair face, with its dark, restless eyes, its fine characteristic mouth, whose beautiful lips were now set and troubled--it was a pleasant study. A truly womanly face, but full of latent power and strength. She looked pale and weary.   HONOR BRIGHT.         129 "You are tired. Clare keeps you too closely?" She shook her head, but looked more troubled still at mention of him. "I will be glad when the roads are passable; riding will do you good. Mother and Clare need it too." She thanked him for his kindness. He seemed annoyed, as he always did at gratitude. The casement at which they were standing overhung the precipitous ravine or mountain gorge; the snow was melting, and the stream, which all winter had been ice- bound, now had broken its glistening chains, and was rushing through its sinuous bed, in mad, wild glee. She was looking down into it, her face full of memories. His eyes followed hers. "It is a wild place; one might almost look for brigands or contrabandistas among its abrupt curves and precipi- tous bluffs," he said. She smiled. "As a child, I often wished such beingso might be found for the looking." "Why?"' curiously. "Oh, to relieve the monotony." Most of girls would have said, "for the sake of an adventure." Had this girl any romance about her? he would see. "A matter-of-fact reply; was it wholly to relieve the tedium of daily routine, or that some favored knight errant might fly to the rescue of you, his ladye faire." Her lip quivered. Ralph had talked thus so often. He saw the'troubled expression, the grieved lips. The next remark showed the man's innate selfishness. It was put in a cold, trenchant voice, - "You doubt the existence of many things; do you believe in loeve." "Yes," softly, kneeling in a tired way, and resting her arm upon the sill.   130       HONOn .BRIGHT.               "Did you ever love?" It was a cruel question. She turned pale, and did not reply. He went on in a voice quiet, cold, and with a cynical tone. "I do not mean by love a quiet affection; neither a    ; fleeting fancy that makes' its subject an angel, and views it only through roseate lenses; neither a wild, transient passion; but a love that can compass every- thing; that survives despite of faults, or even crime and disgrace; that lives in death; that renders life. a void, ,l a burden, deprived of its object; that absorbs every   thought; that governs every act- a love that shall last through life, and reach out into eternity si qua est. Did you ever love thus?" She grew as white as death, and reeled where she knelt,  at the thought of Ralph.                    "Did you?" almost sternly. "No," the dark eyes looking up into his with an ex- pression that made the voice sound like a cry of anguish.  He laid his hand upon her bright hair, and said, in a voice rendered cold and passive through the intensity   of passion,- "Could you?     .  Her eyes were held in the almost mesmeric fascina- tion of his; she obeyed his indomitable will, and answered simply, -frankly,;- "Yes." Then buried her face in her hands,the blood surging to her very brow, for in that instant she knew that she did love, and love thus. For an instant the man's face flashed and brightened with a glad light; then it grew dark as night, working as in an agony, as it had that night in the music-room. This time, the struggle, though sharper, was more brief; the   HONOR BRIGtT.          131 lips were set, and firm to severity. He took his hand from her head, and closed the window, saying, quietly, - "The air is too fresh; it is not prudent." She uncovered her face; she had knelt a girl -she rose a woman. The transition had been immediate, instanta- neous, like the stepping from one room into another. It was the love that comes but once in any true woman's life, since, having come, it fills it to completeness, utterly precluding the idea of any other. A love that whether met or rebuffed, purifies, ennobles, enlarges her nature. She looked into his face in her frank, earnest way, say- ing simply, and bridging over the great chasm that had in an instant cut her adrift from her old life by a little remark, whose one end rested in the then, the other in the now, - "A moment ago, when the window was open, it was warm; now it is cold." He only half saw its full significance, so looked at her in silence. This strange girl! but an instant before, he had seen her heart! but now, with quiet, fearless hand, she had-drawn the yeil, and that so gracefully, he almost doubted had he'seen it at all. He drew her hand within his arm again, and led her to the library with its unique, wondrously stained doors, and the face of ' Beatrice' over     the mantel. When there, she knelt down before the fire shivering. "You are cold." She did not deny it. He left the room for a few mo- ments, and returned with a glass of wine. At first, she refused to take it, but he put it to her lips, so she quaffed its contents, then sat down on the rich, soft ottoman, which he wheeled up before the fire for her. He stood,   his arm resting on the mantel, watching her. If he had put out his hand, he could have laid it on, her head, so   132       HONOR BRIGHT. near was he ; yet the two were as far apart as if a great gulf lay between them. You could see it in the man's  firm, cold face, in the woman's winsome dignity. She  was conscious of the impassable barrier, though she knew not what it was. At that moment Mrs. Mallory entered     the room. "I have been hunting for you, Charity. I have felt disturbed about you to-day; I am afraid Clare keeps you too busy; you were not even released at lunch. How -long have you been here?" She came to the fire, and stood so that the young girl was between herself and her  : sonI.  "Just an hour. Clare has been manifesting a bit of     selfishness; she was as white as a ghost, when I found  her in the picture-gallery." Mr. Mallory answered for   her, glancing at his watch as he spoke. Mrs. Mallory looked at the girl anxiously; she had    grown very fond of her in these weeks.            "He must not do so again; yet I will not dare tell him  so, he is so sensitive," with a little sigh; then added  t playfully, "Use a bit of woman's strategy, child, and coax  off. He will do anything for you.: you have more in-    i fluence over Clare than any other ever had.- I cannot  help but wonder at it." The young girl changed color, and looked troubled. Mr. Mallory never took his eyes from her face. His mother continued,- "He has been happier since he met you than I ever knew him to be before; " then went on fondly, "I believe, if we had always had you, child, we would, all of us, have been better off to-day. Don't you think so,'Mark?" I-e did not reply, saving to come beside his mother, and put his arm around her. She continued persistently,- "If you had had a little sister like her, you boys would   HtONOR BBIGH1T.        186 have been happier together. With the'strong influence of her latent'womanhood, she would have ruled you both, always stepping in to fill your little differences; and as in childhood, so would it have been now," looking first at the young girl with her changing color, then up into her son's fine, quizzical face; you could feel his quiet, unexpressed amusement, as he asked,-- "Do you think of adopting her, mother? ,' "You needn't smile at me, Mark; I hardly know what I think; I am confident the right thought is there, only it willnot declare itself, even to me," in a, perplexed voice. They both laughed, Mr. Mallory and Charity, but there was a ring of trouble in their laughter. "Here is something a boy on horse-back brought from the town, sir; and he wants you to put your name in his book, sir," said a servant, bowing respectfully, and approaching the master, with a letter on a silver salver. "Mark, it is a telegram! What is the matter?" cried Mrs. Mallory, in a tone of alarm, as her son hastily tore open the envelope, turning pale as he scanned its contents. Then, without replying, he left the room, his mother following him, and Charity was left alone. She did' not even notice or wonder' at Mr. Mallory's agita- tion, or his mother's excitement. The day had b&n too full; it could hold no more. An hour later, a travelling-carriage stood before the main. entrance. Mr. Mallory again entered the library. The girl sat where he had placed her. She did not see him, until he .stood beside her, and laid his hand upon her bowed head, when she glanced up. He wore the travelling-suit she had first seen him in, with the same fur-collar about his throat. His face was cold, 12   134       HONOR BRIGHT. immobile. He said indifferently, by way of explana- tion,- "I have been called away in haste; my mother accom- panies me. She wishes to see you in her apartments." She arose,to obey; he let her get' almost to the door, then called her in a voice which, though quiet, was cut- ting as Damascus steel,- ( You are going?" She paused, looking at him in astonishment. "You said your mother wanted me," wonderingly. "And you do not intend to even say good-bye," with a short, angry sigh.         ' She looked both pale and tired. ("Are you going to be away long?" "Oh no; only a week! A week is nothing, not worth saying good-bye for," with poignant irony.. He folded his arms and stood regarding her. In that hour, since he had left the room, the man had seemed to grow ten years older. What great struggle had he passed through. The girl could not fail to notice it. She came over to where he stood. "Good-bye." He did not move, nor extend his hand, but kept his arms folded. She hesitated a moment, then laid her hand gently upon his arm, and repeated, this time very softly,- "Good-bye." The man seemed fighting a battle, which the touch of that hand, all unwittingly, rendered doubly fierce. He repeated the word after her in a dull, mechanical sort of way, never unfolding his arms. She turned and left him. He watched her out of sight, standing as immobile as a statue I then, with a little bitter laugh, muttered, "Hon- or Bright," and went down to the waiting carriage.   A few minutes after, from an open casement, the girl watched the carriage out of sight. Mrs. Mallory had bade her good-bye with tears in her * eyes, telling her confusedly they had been telegraphed to  come at once to a friend in trouble; and saying, "Be good to Clare, and do not let him work so hard again, for he is really sick; he fainted a few moments ago." Theni the girl's heart, in its,dumb, patient, woman's way, poured out the chrism of its life, and was silent. CHAPTER XII. 'Tis here, but yet confused; Knavery's plain face is never seen till used."

Clare did not make his appear- ance. The meal was simply a form; she ate little or nothing. When it was concluded, she went to her own room, relieved to be alone. She scarce had closed her door, ere there was, a quick, decided rap.   To her "come," old Reliable entered; her parchment-like face was seamed with perplexed lines; her lips turned down almost comically at the corners. "Well, child, so we are alone with the other one." She always called Clare the other one. Charity nodded. "I don't like him," the woman continued, with a char-   HONOR BRIGHT.  acteristic shrug of her angular shoulders. She had come into the room, and was standing near where the girl sat. "Why not, Reliable?" "Bah! he has bad lips; they are too soft," in a dis- gusted tone. "He cannot help his lips," with a little flitting smile. "You like him?" demanded the woman, sharply. "Why shouldn't I?" not so much to tease, as to ob- tain her true objection. Ere she replied, the woman adjusted her glasses, and looked through them keenly at the girl.. "Because he is not the man that any woman should trust. If she did, it would be to her rueing." Then added sneeringly, I've just brought him out of another faint." "What has his fainting to do with it? He cannot help that, Reliable. You said yourself they were likely constitutional with him," persistently. "Umph! I've changed my mind," was the significant retort.        , "You certainly cannot think he affects them?" start- ing. "No, not that; they are genuine. He hates them too bad to put them on." "What then?." "There is something at the bottom of them," wisely. "What, Reliable?" in amazement. "I mean to find out," in an emphatic, determined tone. Charity laughed at her suspicions. The woman only shrugged her shoulders, and left the room with a word of warning, delivered in her blunt, odd fashion,- "Keep clear of him, and you'll not have anything to be sorry for."   HONOR BRIGHT.   137   That was a strange week. In its passing Clare Mallory was utterly incomprehensible to Charity. He was as white as death, anid grew as thin as if he had had a spell i of sickness. Not one moment's rest did he give either ' himself or her. His wonderful powers had never been in such full, free play. Prom early in the morning until late in thie afternoon, without the slightest cessation, there was the unvaried tone of dictation, and the swift gliding of the pen over the paper. Never had his mind been so prolific, his fancy so brilliant, or his imagina- tion so lofty. For successive hours the girl was wrapped, absorbed by the fascination of his ,wondrous talent, held bound by the spell of his strange opinions; swayed to and fro, bewildered, stunned by the theories he ad- vanced and supported with sophistry so subtle as to be quite indiscernable. When not writing, he charmed and dazzled her with his brilliant conversation. * Not a mo- ment would he brook to be alone. If, when freed from her task, she went to her room for rest, he sent for her; entreating her to come and play chess, pleading patheti- cally that "he was both ill and lonely." Every evening he held her bound to entertain him, either by reading or playing chess, or in controversy, for their conversation was always of a polemic character, since they did not entertain like opinions on any subject. He was both selfish and exacting. He never seemed to see that sle was weary, nor detect the grieved, tense lines that sometimes gathered about her fine, proud lips. If he suspected that the girl was living her heart-life in desolation, fighting its battles, striving for its ,ictories, unaided, he showed no sign, gave no sympathy. He never talked of the 'absent. If by accident his brother's name occurred in conversation, he grew restless and disturbed, and usually ordered a glass of wine shortly 12*   138       HONOR BRIGHT. after. The quantity of wine he drank in that week, fairly startled Charity. He seemed wholly to live on it- was constantly under. its exhilarating influence. The girl little suspected that in the evening, when at length released she sought her room and solitude, that he drank the very night away, drowning thought, reason, and feel- ing in the stupor of intoxication. Occasionally Mr. Hammond would drop in for a few hours. Selden had not been there since the night Clare had fainted. Charity noticed his absence, and spoke of it in wonderment; as she did so,. Clare moved nervously among his cushions, whilst Mr. Hammond, being at the time present, exclaimed,- "I have had a note from Selden. He said he would be home presently. Business had called him away. I think it slightly unaccountable myself. It was very inconsiderate too, to the feelings of parties interested, to abscond in such a clandestine fashion, never saying a word to any one. I've my suspicion the man has gone off to get married--ahem! ho!-" and he slapped his fat knees, and laughed until the tears coursed down his cheeks, at the idea, as he said, of "Selden turning romantic fool, and: being principal party in a runaway match."  It was an afternoon, when the week was in its last day. Charity had been writing since breakfast; a per- fect April day it was, with its bright, sunny smiles and sudden bursts of tears. The day was almost gone now, and it was raining. Charity'had drawn the secretary close to the casement chasing the fast-fading light. Clare, that day, had been dilating on the union of spirits, or the doctrine of affin-. ity. His argument had both charmed and annoyed her. Its laxity of virtue, so glossed over by beautiful imagery,   HONOR BRIGHT.         139 and perfection of expression--that right was fused and lost in wrong-the dividing line utterly obliterated. He had kept her so absorbed in his thoughts, she had no time for her own. Now there was a little silence, nothing to break it save the beating of the rain against the win- dow-panes-the young girl was playing idly with her pen, looking out into the gathering gloom with tired, wistful eyes.    .  "Charity, do you believe in marriage?" She started; she was not expecting him to speak, save in the dull wearying tone of dictation; thus she did not comprehend his question, and'asked him to repeat. "Do you believe in marriage?" She made no reply, save to raise her head in womanly dignity, and look at him with withering scorn.  A moment he was confused; then continued boldly,- "I cannot see how you can, consistently. Marriage is a divine institution; since you do not admit divinity, how can you acknowledge its ordinances?" The logic was coherent, keen, trenchant. She made no reply, but rested her head in her hand, as if in deep thought. He was silent a moment, watching the effect, then continued,-                   , "If you should ever love -" The blood rushed to her very brow, then died, leaving her doubly pale by contrast. At the sight his beautiful face writhed and contorted with jealous rage., It was but for an instant though; he recovered himself,- "If you ever should love, could you submit to the commands of a being whose very existence you deny? Can you not see the absurdity of the position?" Again she did not reply. She did not seem to con- sider it a question, but rather a subject presented for her 1      f  h   "O       EONOR 'BRIOBT. deliberation; neither did he appear to expect an answer, but added still another,-     , "Do you think it wicked for a man to have more than one wife at a time?"                  ? Her eyes fairly flashed with scorn and indignation. Ere she could speak, he went on, with his gay ringing laugh, If you married a man, and afterward found he had another wife, what would you do, Charity?" She arose from her seat and stood before him with  almost royal dignity, her firm, proud lips curled in inimit. J able scorn. "Clare Mallory, your question is an insult; you owe  j me an apology."  He cowered beneath her glance, and craved her pardon in almost abject cringing, then recovered himself with  that mocking, heartless laugh, and said in that tone of inuendo, which had before chilled her heart with horri-  ble suspicion, - "Such things have been done; there is no reason whyA they should not be again." She did not resume her seat, but stood, as if about to leave the room. He saw the effect his insinuation had  produced, and there was a triumphant play to his full, voluptuous lips.                  E' "Charity, why will you not sit down and talk to me?  he said, pleadingly.  She shook her head coolly. "I'm tired."      , "Of me?" in a hurt tone. "Of your conversation. It has been disagreeable," haughtily. "You are always angry at me," his soft lips quivering.   ,' BONOR BRIGHT.        141 "Only when you give me just provocation, Clare," kindly. "True, I should not complain; you treat me as well as I could expect, who am hateful in the sight of all," with a misanthropical expression on his beautiful face. "Clare, you are so suspicious. You misinterpret every act, viewing them only through the--most unkind' medi- um. Then, too, you are so exacting, you demand more than any one else would think of," in a tone of frank re- monstrance. ' Pray, continue enumerating my faults, it is highly entertaining," in a tone of cutting sarcasm. She pitied him, slave as he was to his jealous, suspi- cious disposition, and showed it in her face. For a mo- ment his eyes glared with anger, then softened, and grew lustrous and dimmed with tears. ' "Better pity than hatred," he said, sorrowfully. Her heart ached for him. She drew a chair near his lounge, and sat down, saying, gently, "Clare, I wish I could help you to be happier than you are." He covered his eyes with one of his white, delicate hands. "You cannot; none can. I shall never be happy, neither in this life, nor in the life to come." Reading his own death sentence; signing with ruthless, daring hand, his own death warrant; cursing his own soul to perdition. The girl shuddered. At that moment old Reliable passed the door, glancing in as she did so; her withered face seamed and wrinkled with anxiety. They did not see her. She had passed unseen many times that day, and- every preceding day, since the master had left; keeping watch on the enemy's border; a grim, staunch sentinel.   "2       HONOR BRItHT. For a little, there was silence. Then the young girl broke it.  "Clare, you must be a hypocrite in your belief, other- wise you could not be so daring." "It is neither daring, nor hypocrisy; it is fate. There are those 'born to, the day of wrath,' you know," in a tone of bitter despair. (' I would not believe as you do, Clare, for all the wealth of the Indies. I would rather be as I am, utterly devoid of any faith, than to entertain such!" excitedly. Heochanged the subject abruptly. "It is a week to-night since they left." It was the first time he had voluntarily mentioned either his mother or brother. She nodded assent. "It has been a long week to you?" looking at her keenly. In her frank, unequivocal way, she said,-- "Yes." His face darkened. "If Mark had been in my place, it would have been different," with that bitter, uncontrollable jealousy. She did not 'condescend a reply. At that moment, a servant announced dinner. When the meal was con- eluded, Charity left Clare over his wine. Ai hour or two later he joined her, where she was reading in her favorite room, -the old library. She was seated by a table, her book directly under a lamp, whose light, softened and tinted by the exquisite coloring of its shade, streamed down over her bright hair and black dress. So interested was she in the volume over which she was poring, that she did not discover his presence for some time; then glancing up, she saw him reclining among the rich, luxurious cushions of the lounge, his   ONORJ BBRIET..        143 delicate hand supporting his face. Never had it been more wonderfully handsome, flushed and brilliant as it was with wine. She started nervously. "When did you come in, Clare?" He had detected her start, and gave a little, bitter, tri- umphant laugh.    - "I must wield some power over you, else you would not be nervous at seeing me unexpectedly," he said. "That is not answering my question," haughtily. Neither did he do so then, but went on in a tone of smothered excitement, - "Do you know, Charity, I would rather have you afraid of me, than so tormentingly indifferent., It fairly drives me mad." He half arose among the soft cushions, as he spoke. Her head was slightly raised with a sort of queenly. hauteur.  "Clare, can we never talk on such subjects as other people are wont to discuss when together?" impatiently. He gnawed his nether lip in silence. She resumed her book with purposed indifference. But his burning, in- tense eyes, annoyed her. She made no progress, and in a few moments glanced at him, saying, petulantly,-- "Clare, your persistent gaze disturbs me." "Why, I was looking at Beatrice," with an equivocal laugh.    . She regarded him with withering contempt. Clare, I would not have suspected you of an untruth." He laughed with provoking gayety. "Why, you unsophisticated bit of woman-kind, can you not comprehend how I can be looking at your face, and still see only the face of Beatrice?" She thought he had taken too much wine. He sat erect among the cusidons a moment, as if to steady him-   "4        HONOR BRIGHT. self, then went over and stood directly before the picture of Beatrice over the mantel. The girl looked at him in the full blaze of the mingled lamp and fire-light. His small, deformed figure, his flowing, waving hair, and his face wondrously beautiful as the Greeks conceived the faces of their gods to be. His strange talents, too; un- consciously the girl was Swayed by their power. He glanced over, and met the expression of admiration de- picted on her face, with a little, pleased laugh. "You cannot conceive how looking at your face is tantamount to looking at the face of Beatrice?" gayly.  ! "I cannot," was the sententious reply.          I "Shall I explain?"  "If you can," incredulously.              I "I can, since even Mark discovered the resemblance. . Your face and the face of Beatrice are one."'  He laughed with unnatural gayety, at her blush, saying tauntingly,-                     E "You have been striving sedulously to make me think  I you unlike other women, with none of their little foibles i and weaknesses; you were near convincing me too, I own, but now your assiduous efforts are all swept aside. I have broken down your battlements of hauteur and indif- ference; you ar'e like all other of your kind. I have seen you blush with pleasure at being told your face is like the face of a beautiful picture." The blush instantly died. She met his look of triumph and unconcealed adoration with her wonted coldness. "Ha! you cannot deceive me again. Women are all alike, and I have been a fool to imagine you an excep- tion," with the ringing, meaningless laugh of intoxica- tion.

"Now I have driven you away again; pray come back,' remorsefully. Then, as she paused in the door-way to say good-night, continued excitedly, - "It is the last night of the week. His lordship ,said about a week; he is always on time. They will be here to- night. Pray do not leave me alone!" There was a cry of mingled desolation and fear in that last word, " alone." She hesitated, his dark lustrous eyes meeting hers in a sort of dumb pleading. He glanced at his watch - "It is only eight o'clock. Stay an hour' at least; per- haps they will come in that time," in eager ,appeal. He looked so desolate, she came back, resuming her seat at the table. He thanked her very humbly, and went back to his lounge. For a time there was silence, she reading, he shading his eyes with his hand, his soft voluptuous lips now set, now quivering, in strange, unhappy play. This silence is insupportable; read to me, Charity?" in a virulent tone. "What shall I  read?" not glancing at him. She had turned few leaves; evidently, the book had failed to chain her wandering thoughts. "What are you reading?" "Theodore Parker on Theism." He sneered, - "Spare me. I've no notion of unsettling my ideas, "i   "6       HONOR BRIGBT. and mixing them in one chaotic conglomeration with such crazy theories. I dipped into his writings to my rueing, once. I'd like something for recreation, if it will hot be too great an act of self-denial for you to lay that aside." She did so immediately, saying, as she went to the book- case, - "What shall it be, Clare?" "Something of Byron's." She selected "Childe Harold." She read for an hour - the poet's spirit holding theirs I in its wondrous sway, with its depth and strength, its  ,; touching human weakness, too. The mingled beauty and    grandeur of the poet, and the sin and pathos of the man. ! She closed the book, and looked half pityingly, half searchingly, at the humpback. His eyes were covered; she did not know that he was conscious of her gaze; sud-  denly he drew away his hand, and looked at her. His    i face flushed and feverish; his dark, lustrous eyes half flash- t ing with anger, half dimmed with tears.  "For once I can emulate Mark's penetration, and read unspoken thoughts. You are tracing the points of resem- blance between Byron and myself. You strip away with  ;. ruthless, daring hand, the brilliant glowing robe of the poet, and disclosing the unadorned man, call him Clare Mallory." * She did not deny it; she would, not--neither did he give her time - but went on bitterly, - ( We have the same morbid minds; the same jealous, unhappy dispositions; the same craving and yearning for love ever denied. We are both deformed, and in both, the beauty centres in face alone." -He paused a moment, then continued excitedly,- "Aye, you dare not, but Idare trace the similitude (,   HBONOR BRIGHT.         147 fartJer," and he arose nervously from his uneasy cushions, and swept his long, wavy hair' back from his feverish brow. "You may lay my life with his right through. Yet I never saw it until you read to-night. I've been a blind fool, an idiot." She looked disturbed; he noticed it. "There - I'm not to touch on anything but common- places. I forgot. Only do not punish me as is your wont, by leaving only your remembrance to haunt and torment me," his tone filled with a strange ningling of anguish and bitterness. She said nothing, but regarded him with'an uneasy, troubled expression. He covered his face again, and she went back to her silent reading. For a short space there was silence; he broke it by a remark far wide the subject they had been discussing.     '   . "Charity, did it ever strike you   as, strange, that Mark and   I had no wives?" There was that tone of quiet inuendo in his voice, that always troubled her, and gave her an unaccountable start of dread, and foreboding as if reeling on the brink of some terrible dis- closure. "No, Clare.  Why   should it?" with forced com- posure. "You knownothing of our past lives. We might each have one, and you be never the wiser," with a mocking insinuating laugh.           ' She turned as pale as death. "What if I  should tell you I had a wife and half a dozen children?" questioningly. She drew a  little gasp of relief. "Have you?" indifferently.   "8        HONOR BRIGHT. ( What if I should tell you Mark had?" She reeled where she sat,-- "Has he?" it was no better than a whisper, and an. guish made it cold and passive. ( A half a dozen children'! no," with a wild, sneering laugh., He had no need to answer the first part. She knew it with terrible certainty. This, then, was the impassable barrier. The deep, unbridged gulf that separated them, and her love--it fell back upon her heart with a deadly weight, crushing out all its hope, all its joys; laying it a barren, ruined waste. And the humpback, with wild, hun-   I gry eyes, drank deep of the heart-anguish pictured on    i her face. /[is face fairly flashed and glistened at the , draught. At length it aroused her; she looked at him    i with the bewildered air of one being stunned for a moment. Then the lips grew firm and proud; the eyes veiled their  anguish beneath coldness ;' the face grew strong and firm,   though ashen white.                      Troubles are varied in their effects. With some they blunt the faculties, dull the sensibilities, bewilder and   stupefy; with others they quicken the powers, by rous- ing them to resistance. Some natures sinl under a load,    whilst others struggle until they cast it off, and arise    stronger for the conflict.               There are natures that require difficulties for their development. The obstacles thrown in their way draw      forth the strength and powers hitherto latent, ennobling, purifying, elevating their characters, and enlarging their capabilities. So it was with this girl of whom we are telling. Her life had been a monotony--a dead level, with no striking incidents for way-marks. . Until the last few months, it had held neither any great joy nor sorrow. Of a surety it had been full of suffering, but *^   HONOR BRIGHT.         149 it had been mostly of a negative sort, only appearing poignant, when compared with lives of happiness such as the young may generally boast. The plague had been the first great break in the dull routine of her existence -for existence, not life, was the correct term by which to designate her being; since its terrible blight, its sweeping, resistless devastation, the flood-gate of trouble had swung upon its hinges-- "one woe had trod upon another's heels" - but beneath each fresh sweeping tide, her heart had struggled and rebound- ed, with the hope characteristic of youth. "It is the last blow that fells the tree."  It had been dealt with cruel, wanton hand. The heart, wearied from continual conflict, fell deadened, benumbed. For a mo- ment every faculty forgot its wonted function. After that first cold, proud  glance at the humpback, she shielded her eyes with her hand, and seemedagain to read.  He watched her in amazement; unwittingly, she had deceived him. Excess of anguish had made her ap- parently indifferent and passive. He thought her man- ner real, not assumed; his face brightened; the cloud of jealous anger swept instantly away; his spirits rose, but only to fall as suddenly. There was a slight confu' sion in the hall; he sprang to his feet, saying, in a tone of wild alarm,-- "They have come; oh! my God!" Charity scarce heeded him, but glanced out at the open door with a   dazed, bewildered expression. At that moment Mrs. Mallory entered the room. She kissed Clare, and came with arms lovingly. extended to greet Charity; ere the young girl could meet them, there was a wild, terrified cry. Clare fell fainting where he stood.

Every one losing self-possession and doing the thing best left undone, until Old Reliable, ever in the-back-ground of the picture, brought to the emer.  gency her sound judgment and efficient aid.               Mark  had lifted the frail, deformed figure in    his strongarms, and laid him   gently on the lounge.   Mrs. Mallory was full of a mother's alarm and anxiety, saying in a troubled tone, -        . "We should not have come in so suddenly and unex-          pectedly; it was thoughtless, since we knew how easily he faints - Clare, my poor, beautiful, unhappy boy," bathing his temples with, nervous hands.. Charity stood a little apart from  the group around the lounge, for once helpless, her face as white as the uncon- scious face of the beautiful humpback; whilst utterly unheeded, regarding them all with an expression of won- derment, was the little child.   HONOR BRIGHT.          151 Under Old Reliable's vigorous treatment, Clare quickly revived. Her withered parchment-like face was the first his eyes met; he shuddered and drew back; he seemed to dislike the woman. Yet in the kindness of her heart she had put her face between his and the white, anxious ones gathered about. At that expression of recoil, she drew back, and revealed the scene. The child, prompted by curiosity, had drawn near the lounge; she innocently stepped into her place, and standing high on her tiny tip- toes, peered over at the humpback. An    expression of terror convulsed his features; his eyes started wildly from his head; he half sprang up; then, with a desperate effort at self-control, sank back among. the cushions, saying with a bitter, mocking laugh, - "Mark, is this the result?" His mother bent low over him and explained some- thing in a tone too low for any save his ears. He looked infinitely relieved, and laughed that ringing, impish laugh again; then sitting upright, said with a bitter sneer,-                      ! "I am worse at a faint than any woman; a mere shadow will send me from consciousness. It's all owing to this cursed deformity," touching' his shoulders with cruel force. His voice was full of keen, poignant reproach. Mrs. Mallory's gentle eyes filled with tears; she turned sadly away. Mark had been regarding his brother in silence, his face immobile as the face of a statue, reveal- ing no emotion.   Now he took an easy chair, sinking into it wearily. Old Reliable, since Clare had wholly re- covered, had left the room with a significant "Humph." Charity, pale and quiet, was helping Mrs. Mallory divest herself of her wrappings, and then, with the thoughtfulness that never forsakes a true woman in any case, had left the room to order supper for the travellers.   2       HONOR BRIGHT. She longed to escape from them all; besides, true deli- cacy bade her leave them by themselves, and not thrust herself in upon this their family trouble. That there was trouble she instinctively knew, but, crushed beneath the weight of her own, she could not even look to theirs. She lingered in the dining-room until the meal was served and announced, turning deadly pale as she heard the approaching footsteps through the marbled halls, with among them the patter of very tiny feet. A strange sound in that grand, imposing building. Mr. Mallory took his accustomed place. A servant by his direction improvised a high chair by the means of an ottoman, lifted the little child into it, and placed her beside him. "Charity, I am tired, love; will you pour the tea?" And Mrs. Mallory took the girl's wonted place. Clare had not come out. There was not the slightest flush to the girl's cheek, nor tremble to her hand, as she took her place opposite the master of all this wealth, the place that a wife was wont to fill. She poured the tea with a quiet- ness trenching on dignity. Mr. Mallory too was cold and reticent. His mother with her gentle effort to please strove to smooth over the great hiatus each unconsciously seemed to feel had rent their lives, talking. in her winning, kindly way, asking questions about the week they had been absent, praising Old Reliable's care and trustworthi- ness, asking about Clare's health and her own, and as to whether they had been lonely without them, and with hesitating speech, but very loving eyes, explain- ing about the little child- how that "' she had adopted her." All this while, the master had been silent, preparing, with the care of a woman, supper for the little creature beside him, who seemed to look to him to meet all her   HONOR BRIGHT.          153 wants. As his mother said this, he glanced over to the girl; she met his eyes; they told nothing; they were the same quiets light-blue eyes of old, searching rather than revealing -questioning not answering. The child had not spdken since placed at the table, so busy had the hungry little creature been. At length, in a pause, she said with baby accent,- "Mark, "me wont ayow ou to eat any more tate," and one little chubby hand stole the tempting bit from his plate, whilst the- other came down with the pretty wil- fulness of childhood upon the table. They all smiled, even Charity, whilst Mr. Mallory, seeming to have no appetite, leant back in his chair to watch the little tyrant. When the purloined morsel was finished, she clasped her little pink fingers on the table, and looking first at the cake-basket, then into the quiet, amused face of the master, said with a roguish, coaxing face,- "Me yikes tate, me do." "I am afraid it will make her sick, Mark," remonstra- ted Mrs. Mallory smiling. He fed it to her in crumbs, after that, as if she had been a bird? so making a very little last until the meal was finished. It was pretty to see it, this courtly dignified man, laying aside all his customary-taciturnity and reticence, and yielding gracefully to the will of this tiny baby tyrant. "Mark, you will spoil her," said his mother, looking at Um i  with proud, fond eyes. There was a singular ex- pression on his face as he met the look, an expression that Charity could not understand; she only felt the savor of sadness it held. The baby had been spoiled already, as was shortly proved, for when the meal was finished, and Mr. Mallory   154:       HONOR BRIGHT. had sent for a servant to take her to bed, she rebelled, in- dignantly kicking her tiny feet, and crying with baby fury,-  "Me won't ayow it." Mrs. Mallory sought to amuse her by rattling the spoons and forks, and promising her more cake, "if she would go with nurse," but childhood will not brook reason or bribery, and so baby cried the more lustily,- "Me won't, me won't!" Mr. Mallory leant back in his chair, with an expres- sion of amusement at the scene, cool and undisturbed by the racket. Most of men would have been annoyed and petulant. Charity glanced at him; nothing seemed to have the power to move him; he was cool, courteous, composed. Mrs. Mallory looked distressed and very tired. Thus far Charity had been a passive listener, taking no part;  , now a look of hesitancy quivered on her fine lips; it was a mere flitting, though, passed as soon as come. She arose and came over by the little creature's chair, hold- ing out her hands for her, whilst the latent, undeveloped motherhood that exists even though dormant in every woman's breast, softened her proud face, relaxing the tense lines of suffering about eye and lip, and bathing it in a loving light. She said to Mrs. Mallory, - "You are tired; let me keep her to-night." Then coaxingly to the stormy little elf, - "Come, Birdie." Busy as she had been with her supper, the little thing had not noticed the girl before. Instantly the shrill, in- dignant cry was hushed. She looked at her with the searching, discriminating expression we term in child- hood instinct, then reached out her hands, with a pleased   HONOR BRIGHT.          155 laugh, and as Charity took her in her arms, buried both her chubby fists in the girl's bright hair, saying delight- edly,- "Pretty! pretty " Mrs. Mallory looked pleased. "We might have known she would go to you, love," in a fond tone. The girl intuitively met the master's eye. It held an answering smile to the child's innocent admiration. She colored. She was standing directly beside him ; the baby fearlessly threw herself toward him for a kiss; then, with the innocence of childhood, said, - "Pretty, 'ou tis Mark too?" The blood rushed to her very brow, Mrs. Mallory laughed, whilst!the master leaning back looked up into her face with that quiet air of amusement peculiar to him. She turned suddenly, impetuously, and carried the child from the room. He watched her out of sight; then went to his own apartments, his face quiet, immobile, determined. Mrs. Mallory followed Charity shortly, with a snowy little night-dress, then kissing them both, said good-night, and Charity was alone with the child - this little child, who was the personation of some great trouble, some great mystery; perhaps some great sin. This little child who, 'in some way unexplainable to her, stood in tiny, helpless baby-hood, an impassable barrier between her and this man whom she loved. Yet she held, her in her arms.   What fate had brought her there! was it all chance. Unconsciously she acknowledged this strange, delicate tracery of light and shadow in the picture of her life, to be the creation of an omnicient mind, the work of an omnipotent hand. She was very pale; her fingers trembled so that she   156       HONOR BRIGHT. scarce could undo the dainty robes, revealing the little, snowy, dimpled figure, all the while listening to the guile- less lisping prattle. When wrapped in her slip, she slid down upon the floor, her tiny pink toes sinking in the soft rich carpet. To the young girl she was a marvel; she watched with a sort of loving curiosity to see what she would do. She pattered about the room in high glee at its beauties, laughing merrily, whenever she caught a glimpse of her tiny self in the crystal depth of the mir- ror. After a while she came back to the young girl's side saying, - "Me tired; me pay now." She did not understand her, but ere she could ask her to repeat, the little creature dropped upon her knees beside her, and clasping her hands, raised her winsome, sunny face, and said reverently,- "Dear )od, bless mamma and baby, and bless Pretty, too, that's a dear Dod." The young girl bent her head in awe; the guileless lips of childhood, with beautiful faith, had besought the very God she doubted, for her. Scarce had the curly head nestled in the pillow, ere she slept. The girl stood and watched her with an expression of deep, troubled thought; her lips were now firm, now quivering with hesitancy; her face now cold, proud, self-reliant, now softened and yearning. All was forgot- ten; her love; her anguish; her suspicion; this troubling, puzzling, mysterious babyhood ;. all lost, swept away by the hand of Deity, and the girl stood, her soul con- fronting its Maker. The bright head was bowed in rev- erent awe; the stubborn, perverted reason yielded, and was convinced; the heart poured out its oblation of pen- itence and adoration; she sank upon her knees and wor- shipped; thus believed, and believing, loved.

Once Old Reliable looked gently in at the door, and seeing the girl thus kneeling, stole softly away, tears of thanksgiving on her seamed,] wrinkled face. It was in the " wee sma' hours," when at length she arose; her face was purified, beautified, and overspread with the ineffable restfulness of that peace "' which passeth understanding." She had, in the sacred silence, learned "what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and heighth," of that "love of Christ which passeth knowledge." A moment she stodd regarding with unutterable love the face of the little sleeper, lifted the moist, sunny curls from her temple, and stooping, kissed her; then softly opened the door, and stepped out into the hall. The darkness was dense, but to this girl, whose eyes were dazzled with the halo emanating from the Deity, it seemed bright as noonday. She went noiselessly through one grandi broad passage after another, toward a distant portion of the building. At length she stopped before a door; it was slightly ajar, a light from within streaming out through the crack. She opened it noiselessly and entered; before the grate-fire, in her customary attitude, seated on the floor, her long, gaunt arms embracing her knees, sat Old Reliable. She was not conscious of the girl's presence until she stood beside her, her hand on the broad, angular shoulder. v "Reliable."  The woman glanced up; she needed no aiid of double lenses, to discover the flush. of holy, satisfied joy on the fair face bending over her, neither word of explanation, but said, the brusque, kindly voice shaking with emo- tion,-  "I know, child; I have been waiting up to hear."   158        -HONOR BIGQHT.

She had been there already, by the early dawn, looking at that picture of her dying Lord. Life seemed full to completeness. Life!' eternal life! Love unutterable, immortal! The sorrow, the sin of humanity forgotten, lost in the joy and perfection of Deity. A just God; a merciful Saviour; the plan of salvation was complete, entire; she accepted it joyously, penitently; he loved her, this Christ; he died for her! Oh, wonderful love! oh, marvellous pity! In the great rush of adoration and gratitude, her soul threw itself pros- trate at the foot of the cross. Thus the hours sped away) hours made glad and bright by the glory and effulgence of the Lord. At length she left the gallery. She wan- dered with the restless joyousness of a child, through the building. Never had it seemed so beautiful as now! and she was to have the whole. day to herself! a day of free- dom! She was as glad as a child of a holiday. She stopped at all the windows to look out at the land, smil- ing and beautiful in the April sunlight, and at length paused at that same door from which, only a little over a week ago, she had looked forth so hopelessly, so des- pairingly. Now, again, the door was open; the master's buggy stood before it; .the horse, a beautiful, spirited animal, pawing the ground impatiently. At that instant there was a hand laid on her shoulder; .she turned; it was the master. "I have been looking every place for you." His face was pale and haggard; there was a little pang in the glad heart. "You are not well; what can I do for you?" in her frank, earnest way.       - He smiled bitterly. "Nothing. I'm quite well, thank you."  She waited a moment; then said, in a puzzled tone,-   160       HONOR BRIGHT. "You said you had been looking for me." "Yes.

"I should not suspect you of being troubled with nerves, Mr. Mallory. "Of course not. I am made of iron. I judged such was your opinion," with poignant sarcasm. She looked troubled. He was silent a moment; then went on,- "I am going to drive to the furnace; would you like to see it?  Her face flushed with pleasure; she said, with child- like eagerness,-  "You are very, very good!" He looked pleased, and bade her get her wrappings; then watched her out of sight. She interested, fascinated him with her infinite variety. A week since, he had left her with white, hopeless face; even last night the broad brow had- contracted as with pain, and there had been tense, grieved lines about the lips; now the face was beau- tiful, and radiant with a soft, glad light. She was gone but a few moments. i When she returned he had gone out, and was untying the horse. She looked lovely as she came down the steps, her black shawl wrapped gracefully about her, her crape bon- net confined by a loose, careless knot under her chin; her simple, homely dress utterly ignored by the natural elegance and dignity of her bearing. There was a gleam of admiration in his keen, critical eye, as he lifted her in- to the buggy, then sprang in beside her; and, after wrapping her well in the robes, gave free rein to the restless horse.

Not with the old firmness of dumb endurance, though, for mingled with the stoi- cism, which through education had become second nature, was an expression of faith and tried, true trust. Mr. Mallory was watching her, with his cool, quiet eyes, veiling every thought and feeling; yet he, too, remem- bered that last drive with her--that terrible deathly drive. Glancing up she met his eye. "Once I was sorry that you found me; now I am glad,?' she said, hesitatingly. He. made no reply; his face was perfectly immobile. She did not tell him why she was glad, but glanced away, seeming lost in thought. The ride was a silent one. The sky above beautifully blue; the hills, on one side white, where the late March snow had drifted; on the other, brown and bare in the April sun. So the two miles sped away under the horse's feet, and gradually the hills to the left rolled away in graceful undulations, until fused and lost in the broad level stretch of land, and before them lay the town with its suburban burying-ground. As they approached, Mr. Mallory looked curiously at the girl. A weaker nature would have intuitively glanced away, shrinking with hor- ror from probing the old wound--but this girl turned her face fully, bravely toward it. As she did so she started; a look of wonder in her eyes. The master drove up to the fence; then drawing rein paused. Where the group of unmarked graves had been, towered a mas- sive, granite monument; and beside it, where Ralph was laid, an humbler one of white marble. She comprehended it instantly; her lip quivered, she made a desperate effort it taty;hr i, q      .ii   162       HtONOR BRIGHT. for self-control, but failed signally, and buried her face in her hands. He looked surprised; yet another idiosyncrasy. He had seen her pass through great troubles unflinchingly, breasting cruel difficulties with I firmness and stoicism that had sometimes seemed to verge on indifference. But a moment since she had turned fearlessly to meet a sor- rowful recollection; but on finding an unlooked-for kind- ness, had broken down, pride and coldness swept away. He did not speak, but waited, watched. Almost in- stantly she recovered self-control, and dashing away her tears, said, brokenly, - "I cannot thank you; there is no need to try." He waived her effort with that little imperious, though graceful gesture, and springing out, lifted her to the ground; then, with true delicacy, left her to enter the grounds alone. She was gone some little time; when she returned her face, for all its gratitude, was pale with suffering. He looked disturbed, and lifting her in, said, - "You should not have come here to-day, only there is no other road to the furnace." Then added, anxiously, as he wrapped the robe about her, and springing in beside her gave rein to the horse,- "Did you get your feet damp?". She shook her head negatively. . After that he bent all his powers to divert her atten- tion, chaining her every thought with his rare conversa- tion so that the face lost its sorrowful look, regaining the expression of gladness it had worn. They drove through the town, the furnace being on its hither suburb. At length it loomed up before them, a massive, dark, dingy structure, spreading out with won- derful length and breath; theair, for many rods around   HONOR BRIG'HT.         163 it, stifling and black with the great volumes of smoke emitted from its huge chimney. He drew rein before it. There was no need for him to alight or call. The, master had come; instantly a work- man, with sooty face, approached, doffing his cap respect- fully. The master bade him good-day, most courteously, re- questing him to send the foreman to him; then, as the man went to do his bidding, turned to the young girl,- "You have been on the damp earth too' long already. I cannot let you alight. Some night when they are cast- ing you will enjoy it better." She yielded, never thinking to dispute his quiet de- cision. When he had given his directions, he drove on again, taking the road that lay along the edge of the nar- row though rapid river, on whose bank the furnace stood. Now both land and water glistened in the sunlight. "How beautiful!" she exclaimed. "You have never been here before?"incredulously. "Never. I have never been anywhere, Mr. Mallory," with a little laugh. "Would you like to travel?" "Like!" indignant at the absurdity of the question; then adding lightly, "I am apt to take it out in liking." He said nothing. There was a peculiar expression on his face. She noticed it, and felt annoyed, so said, with a touch of impatience,- "Why do- you look so, Mr. Mallory?   One would think I had said. something amusing." He laughed. "You unsophisticated child." Clare had called her the same; it was anything but flattering. She colored, saying with a sort of petulant sarcasm,-   164:       HONOR BRIGHT. "I presume Iam very obtuse; Hhave never seen any. thing of the world, you know; the few I have been wont to mingle with, have expressed their thoughts by words, not looks-consequently, the language of physiognomy is a dead one to me." She could feel that quiet provoking amusement. "You simply need a little education, since you can speak though not read it," tantalizingly, and looking with well concealed admiration at the expressive, indignant face. She did not condescend a reply; so there was a long silence; she looking at the land and water; bathed, aye fairly flooded, in the sunlight; he at her face - grown strangely still and peaceful now. Presently, by the irresistible magnetism of those quiet blue eyes, her gaze came from the sunlight to his face, unconscious what drew it, -yet flushing a little, at find- ing his look bent on her. "Well?" he said. She did not understand him; he explained. "May one know one's thoughts?" Her cheeks brightening was the only reply. He was silent, waiting with that winning, though determined wil- fulness characteristic of him. She obeyed a little hesitatingly. i I was looking at the sunlight."     .  Again that unexpressed amusement. "Yes, so I saw." She was silent a moment in indecision; then said softly, and with very heightened color, - "I was thinking of that light that never was on land or sea." His face grew cold almost to sternness; for a little there was an uncomfortable silence. Then she said, in an almost child-like tone,-   HONOR BBIGHT.         165 A Are you sorry, that I am glad, Mr. Mallory?" The question was trenchant, pointed. He had been. sorry; the man's selfishness had conquered every noble feeling. She had come to him for help-he had been unable to give it; now she had sought and found the Great Helper. Since he had torn the veil from her heart, the man had thought his image there, but now with the daring hand of an iconoclast she had dashed it to pieces, rearing in its place the cross. He had been sorry, but at this- question, put in the hurt, grieved tone .of a child, he paused to think. For a moment there was a struggle, then with inimitable scorn, he cast aside his selfishness, and turning, faced her. "I will be honest. I was sorry, but am glad now." Her face brightened, and with a sudden impulse, she laid her hand upon his arm. There was something caressing in the light touch. The blood surged to the man's very brow, but she did not notice it, and instantly by force of his iron will it ebbed. "Mr. Mallory, why were you sorry'?" curiously, draw- ing away her hand. "A bit of the selfishness I proved to you was inherent in my nature," lightly. She looked puzzled. "I cannot see how that could have had anything to do with it." ' Shall I tell you?" "Yes.") He took her face in his hand, looking at it half admir- ing, half incredulous at her unsuspiciousness. Her cheeks brightened under the cool, questioning gaze; he smiled at the blush, an expression of indecision flitted from eye to mouth, then sliglitly raising her face, he bent his proud head, until his lips touched hers.   166   ,    I[OOR BRIGHT.          j You should have seen the change in the girl's race. It grew as white as death- as cold and haughty as a chis- elled Athena. And this man, instead of being hurt at her anger, looked pleased. He bent forward, resting his head on his disengaged Band, thus bringing his face so directly before hers that she could not help but look at it-his proud, immobile face, with genius, power, and strength      stamped in every lineament. "You are offended;' it was not a question, but an assertion. "And why?" "You had no right, Mr. Mallory," with almost regal dignity. "Why?" again. She bit her lip, looking annoyed. "What constitutes right?" She deigned no reply. She thought he -was amusing himself at her expense, and looked at him searchingly. Tnere was not even the slightest play of eye or lip. "Let me present a case. Is there any harm in the mere act of a man kissing, a woman?" with whimsical humor. She had learned to be on her guard against his terse, logical reasoning. He smiled. "Non-committal. Well, I will assume the position, and advance another: Is it wrong for a friend to kiss a friend?"             *  Again no answer; he laughed, recurring a little bitterly to their conversation in the music-room that day, "I forgot; since I am utterly incapable of friendship, that is no plea." For a few moments he was silent, never taking his eyes from her face, though she grew restless and annoyed. He seemed to enjoy her vexation, ,                       .   HONOR BRIGHT.         167  Since you have adopted the language you a little while ago scoffed at?-namely, by your face fearlessly refut- ing every argument advanced - may I repeat my question as to what constitutes right?" then ere she had tinle to speak, added, in a tone of sincere respect, - "I will tell you. You think a true, honorable, and mutual love requisite to right." Her face grew pale as death, her eyes full of a smothered . anguish looked into his, as she replied with cold fearless- ness, "Yes." A moment the man's proud, immobile face worked as in indecision; then sitting erect he whipped up the horses. The rest of the ride was a silent one. When at length they drew up before the main entrance of the Institute, and he had lifted her from the buggy, he detained her a moment, his hand on her shoulder, and bending his head low said,-  "'Some time I will tell you why, in accordance with your own opinion, it is utterly impossible for me to- make the apology your eyes demand." She went into the house with the words ringing in her ears. What did they mean?   Her heart leapt with a great cry of joy. "Perhaps--perhaps-" she did not finish it even to herself; since she did not wholly know her doubt. Clare had said nothing definitely, it had merely been an inu- endo, may be prompted by jealousy; perhaps she had wronged this man, who had saved her life--this man, whom next to her new-found God, she loved. A servant rolled back the massive doors. She crossed the grand domed hall --its playing fountain, its marbled floor, and fretted arches. Led by somet strange, unac- countable impulse, she glanced uip at the loftiest and / A                    X    ].fin      EHONOR BBRIGHT. most curiously wrought, with "Honor Bright" gilt in its azure ground; and as she passed through, repeated to herself,- "Honor Bright - Honor Bright," then wondered why she had done so. As she passed Clare's study to ascend the stairs, she noticed that its glass doors were closed; an occurrence so unusual as to make her pause, and look at them with astonishment. As she did so, she heard angry, excited conversation within.. The voices she instantly recognized as Clare's and Selden's, and the latter's was shrill, and held a tone of threatening. Intuitively she shuddered, as she went up to her room. C:HAPrTEJR XV., "What is this secret sin, this untold tale,   L That art cannot extract, nor penance cleanse?"-  MYSTERIOUS MOTHER.  AFTER that a month went by; a month whose days were spent just as the days of the months preceding, yet that month differed vitally from any other.  It was. impossible to say in what the change consisted. No one could have laid his finger on any single event, and de- clared that it being thrown rudely into the stream of his life, had, with a quick, sudden curve, changed its cuirent. There was the same routine. Clare dictating, Charity writing, Mr. Mallory, as usual, absorbed in busi- ness, spending little of his time, even when at home, with ,.   HONfOR BRIGHT.         169 the family. Charity had more time to herself than for merly; her evenings were usually passed alone, or with  Mrs. Mallory, 1Mr. Hammond and Selden dropping in al- most every evening for a game of billiards. This change in their lives, felt and tacitly admitted by all, assumed but one tangible form. This little child, a three-year old baby, with soft, silky curls, and great, dark eyes that sometimes looked wondrous sad and pitiful; she was indeed, a spoiled little creature, and fairly ruled the household; every one humored and petted her. With fhe servants she was a veritable trnt, whom they delighted to serve. Old Reliable was heriprime favorite. The woman seemed to possess infinite variety and pleasure forher. Shewould arry her about onher broad, angular shoulders nghura shoulders by the hour, and even in her most furious tantrums, the sight of that yellow, parchment-like coun- tenance, with its keen, gray eyes behind the double glasses, and its scroll-like lips turned up with a comical grimace, Thle woman constituted herself chief nurse, as well as house-keeper, and a crib, with its down and lace, dainty enough for a  princess, was placed by her bedside. She seemed never to have been named, this tiny elf. At first they called her Baby; afterwards, by the pet name Charity' had given her that first night, "Birdie." No one seemed to regard the presence of this little stranger inm anything but the most 'matter-of-fact' light. Mr. hsanel-mond , with his customay voluble eloquence, seemed to express the sentiments of all interested, namely, that "It was quite in accordance with the natural benevolence and kindliness   of this gentle Mrs. Mallory, to shield a rs   170       HONOR BRIGHT. wee, stray lamb from the cruel storms of adversity;" and soon, through oft-repeating, the version of the story was, 'that loving children, Airs. Mallory had determined to adopt one, so had taken this child from an orphan asylum." Selden, too, seemed to place perfect confidence in this report; and, in a manner, aided in its circulation. He seemed fond of children, and Charity, in watching him with this child, grew to regarding him with a Certain kindliness that verged on liking. Here was a new phase in his character. He was constantly bringing her little gifts, and would romp and frolic with her like a boy. The man had changed; instead of the fawning sycophant, he had grown captious and ascetic with all save this child. His weak, pusillanimous lips had gathered a certain firm- ness and strength that both pleased and astonished Char- ity. Even Reliable seemed to have noticed the meta- morphosis,' for when Charity mentioned it to her she gave that signmificant "Humph!" The woman was sel- dom without her double glasses now; formerly, it had been her wont to use them only when she read. At length Charity asked the cause, with gentle, womanly delicacy, thinking that her sight was utterly failing her; but to the question she received the gruff, enigmatical reply, - "I always need both my specks, when looking for any- thing." So, as we said before, a month had passed, and it was May, beautiful, budding May, the "' sweet sixteen " of the fear. The orchards were white with blossoms; the soft balmy air redolent with their perfume; everywhere, cro- cuses, hyacinths, and modest, blue violets were peeping forth, glad, and wondering at the great world, whilst the fine, green blades of grass were hadten;ing to spread their robes of velvet on lawn and meadow. The snow had left   HONOR BRIQHT.         171 no trace. It was hard -to believe that winter had ever been, as it is almost impossible to realize we ever had trouble, in the presence of a great joy, another of Nature's similies how utterly inexhaustible they are, if only we could detect their beautiful teachings. In the ravine, the stream glistened in the sunlight, rippling and gurgling'in high glee, whilst all out doors was resonant with the song of the blue-birds and swallows and robins, until the air was transformed into a lofty spacious cathedral, everywhere vibrating with the notes of the grand choir; They drove out every day - Mrs. Mallory, Charity, and  the little child. Sometimes Clare joined them, but it was seldom, and they could not wish it oftener, since he always marred the pleasure by his capricious, misanthop- ical mood.  He was not strong, that spring; his mother thought he lived too much indoors, and often wanted to send for a physician, but he invariably scoffed at the idea, saying bitterly, that-" it was all owing to his damned deformity," and keeping up his strength with constant stimulants.  His mother grew  distressed and troubled, with a look  of foreboding on her gentle face. 1Mark, too, seemed anxious about him, and tried to persuade him: to take a trip, arguing the beneficial effects of change; but Clare always rejected the proposal with impatience, refuting the argument advanced with the theory that - a man's life is contained in his inward nature; out- ward circumstances, such as variety of scene, having no- thing to do with it : that the only change comprehensible to  him was a radical one; an entire change of being. Some few, he thought, met with this through love-; some through sorrow; but all, only in 'death. He looked for his in the latter, alone, and there was a strangely des- pairing expression in the beautiful face as he said it.   172       HONOR BRIG3T.  Charity had scarely seen Mr. Mallory, excepting at meals, since that ride to the furnace, weeks ago. He seemed to have ignored her very existence, though when- ever chance threw them together, he treated her with kind, courteous respect. He seemed to consider that his duty to the family was comprised in supplying their every want, gratifying their every wish: having done this, he held himself aloof from them all; none but this little, privileged stranger, daring to intrude upon his solitude. In these weeks the proud, cold face was not a happy one. The time, to Charity, had been comparatively peaceful; to be sure, there was this love, with its yearnings, its demands, but her strong, self-reliant nature wrestled with it, and though she gained no decided, permanent victory, such as utterly crushing it from existence, still she was never wholly vanquished, and from each fresh, oft-repeated encounter, always came off, for the time at least, victorious. She never could be utterly unhappy, or desolate, since her heart had cast anchor in that sui'e haven xof peace-a Saviour's love. It was an afternoon when the month was almost gone. They had just returned from a ride; Clare had accom- panied them, and fatigued from the exertion, had gone to lie down and have a nap; so, too, had Mrs. Mallory. Charity had laid aside her bonnet and shawl, and taking "Birdie " in her arms, went downstairs. The constant riding had told upon the girl; her cheeks had rounded out, making the contour of her face a perfect oval; the fresh airhad brightened her eyes, and given her a brilliant color. She was strong and well, and with the exuber- ant hopefulness of youth, fairly revelled in the very fact of being. "Birdie" was light as a feather, a mere bit for her three years. The young girl carried her through hall   HONOR BRIGHT.          173 and corridor, through one grand suit of apartments after another, all exquisitely beautiful in their oriental splen- dor. In passing through one, she saw Mr. Mallory sit- ting beside a table, his elbows resting .thereon and his face buried in his hands - the boyish position we have already described as peculiar to him. She passed through noiselessly, thinking him sleeping, and hushing Birdie's, "Oul seepy, Mark?" The1 child was growing sleepy too; the sunny, little face nestled on Charity's shoulder, the tiny hands, that had been clasped around the young girl's throat, loosening their hold and falling limp. Charity carried her to that unique library, with its wondrously-stained doors, and its picture of "Beatrice," which by common consent seemed to be considered the girl's peculiar property. She laid the little creature on the lounge, throwing a rich worsted tidy of warm eastern colors over her, and then drawing a chair beside her, took a book and threw herself in . it with the graceful abandonment of a child, resting her head on one hand, and listlessly turning the leaves of the book with the other. A little after, Mr. Mallory entered; she knew it was he, though she did not glance up; she was piqued by his indifference and apparent obliviousness of her existence. He did not seem to notice her inatten- tion, but going to the book-case, selected a volume, and sat down by the table in the same position she had seen him but a few moments before. She continued turning her leaves, never even glancing at, him. BSo an hour passed; then the little creature on the lounge moved restlessly; Charity bent over her, trying to prolong her nap with woman's musical, "Hush-a-by lul-a-by." "No; me won't yul-a-by no more; me ain't seepy; Baby wants Yiable." 15* -   174:        ONOR BRItGHT. And the child sat up amongst the luxurious cushions, rubbing her dark eyes wide with her wee, chubby fists. "Come; we will go find her," holding out her arms for her. "Why can't you ring for her?" coolly, closing his book, and looking at her. She had not expected him to speak, consequently start- ed, saying a little curtly.-his perfect indifference having provoked her beyond endurance,-  Why should I not take her myself?" "Oh! of course there is not the slightest reason why; must there be a reason for everything under the sunI  Take her yourself, by all means," with bitter irony. She looked annoyed, and hesitated. Birdie, having rubbed her eyes wide open, and seeing no excuse for delay, tossed off her covering in baby-fury, crying,- "Me want Yiable! kick-! kick! kick!" Charity took her in her' arms; he thought she was going, and resumed his reading with apparent uncon- cern; he was mistaken, however; she simply crossed the room, and touched the bell, and on a servant's entering, gave the child into his arms to carry to old Reliable. He had had his way, as usual; there was an odd play to his lips. The moment she had yielded, she was provoked with herself for having done so; and, instead of resuming her seat, with characteristic independence, went over and stood on the opposite side of the table at which he was seated. He closed his book and glanced at her, half amused, half curious. "Well." "I think you are an incorrigible tyrant, Mr. Mallory," fearlessly. He laughed, but did not refute the charge, only leant   HONOR BRIGHT.         175 back in his chair, and looked at her. It made her un- comfortable; she turned abruptly, and resumed her seat, taking up the book she had laid aside, and reading again. lie looked amused. Then, for a little, there was silence; she trying to read; he watching her, having turned his chair slightly, so as to face her. She felt the quiet, amused, blue eyes, and grew restless; at length, closing her book, met them bravely. "Can you give me the substance of what you have been reading for the last ten minutes?" provokingly,. She bit her' lip., I "Mr. Mallory, will you be good enough to tell me what you wish me to remain here for?" "Not to read, certainly, without you choose to do so aloud," coolly; and arising as he spoke, he came over and sat on the lounge, where, a few minutes before, Birdie had been lying, and rested his arm on the young girl's chair. ', I think you vunpardonably impolite and inhospitable," in a tantalizing tone. She did not understand him. "If you should honor me by visiting mny sanctum, I would do my utmost to make you enjoy yourself; whilst I am obliged to exert all the will power I possess to keep you here one moment." The girl colored. "What can I do for you?" "Entertain me, of course." Tell one to talk, and nothing can more effectually seal one's lips. He smiled. "Well; I am waiting," with that quiet, amused air. She set her lips defiantly; he laughed, and after that lent himself to entertain her. In course of their conver- " *    176       HONOR BRIGHT. sation, they fell to discussing constancy, and the immor- tality of love. Mr. Mallory was sceptical on the subject, holding that, " constancy was simply an abstract quality, pretty to portray in romance, but never found in real life."7 Charity disputed the theory, saying that, " if a man or woman once truly loved, no separation, not even death, would break the tie and make them untrue." He scoffed at the idea as sentimental, instancing the very many second, and even third, marriages, and quot- ing historical illustrations of infideity, as Helen of Troy, Mark Antony, Napoleon Bonaparte, and a score of others, by way of proof. "Do you mean, Mr. Mallory, that you really do not think there is such a thing as constancy?" she asked, earnestly. He nodded assent. "There' is no one in the world whom you trust?" eagerly. "No one," a touch of sadness in his tone. "If you had a wife, you would not even trust her?" The immobile face grew deathly pale. - No. Not even her." "I would not believe as you do, Mr. Mallory, for the world!" excitedly. - He did not reply, but rested his head on his hand, thus bringing his face directly before her. It was very pale, the brow contracted as if in pain. "You are not well!" she said, starting at his sudden palor. "Yes; well enough. I have had the head-ache all day, and this room is warm;" as he spoke he arose, and went to one of the casements, throwing it wide, and sweeping back the damask to let the soft air in; then   HOOR BRIGHT.1" drawing a sleepy-hollow close beside it, sat down. The girl followed him, saying with womanly -earnestness ' "What can I do for you, Mr. Mallory? Shall I order a cup of strong coffee?" "No, thank you. It would do no good." She was standing beside his chair; he leant back half- lazily, half-wearily, looking up into her face. The light- blue eyes were dark and intense with suffering. Could physical pain thus wring him? By some unaccountable impulse, the girl laid her hand on his shoulder, saying,- "Are you sure .I can do nothing?" Her face, bending over him with sympathy, its hidden wealth of love unconsciously bathing the dark, lustrous eyes and parted lips, was the beautiful face of "Beatrice." A slight flush overspread the proud, cold face. For answer, he took the hand and laid it on his feverish brow. She understood him instantly, but colored and drewher hand away. "Well, is that wrong, too!" bitterly; recurring to their ride, those months ago. At the question the cheeks grew the hotter. "Any woman might do as much, even for an enemy," with cutting sarcasm in his tone. i *    A moment she hesitated, then laid her hand' upon his brow. It trembled as she did so; he took it away, hold. ing it firmly, though gently, in his. "I shall not allow it, since it requires such self-denial" coldly, the fine face flushing proudly. "You mistake; it was not that," earnestly. "What was it, then?" looking searchingly at her. "I do not know," hesitating and flushing. He released her hand, but did not place it on his brow; he was too proud. He never took his eyes from her face; it was cruel, selfish; her cheeks grew brighter and brighter, her very lips quivered in her struggle for self-control. At   178        HONOR BRIGHT. length, by a desperate effort 'she gained -it, and laid her hand voluntarily on his broad forehead. In truth, Mark Mallory's was a noble head; the crisp, curling hair cut closely, showing its shapeliness, whilst genius, strength, power, sat grandly on the brow, and beamed from eye and lip. At the touch of the trembling, frightened hand, there was a slight play to his lips; she saw it, and set her own firmly, whilst with customary self-control, her hand grew steady. She passed it gently across brow and temple, with quiet, soothing motion. It eased'the pain, the swollen veins in  the temples lost their deep-purple hue, and ceased their fierce throbs; the tense, contracted lines relaxed; he closed his eyes; at length she thought him asleep; she passed her hand with a slower motion; then withdrew it altogether, resting it on the back of his chair, and bend- ing her head to look the more closely at him. His face was perfectly immobile and passive. She drew an otto- man to the window, and rested her arm on the sill, lean- ing her head out to catch the soft spring air. The land was radiant in the last roseate hue of the set- ting sun: the west was brilliant with purple, and crimson, and gold; the reflected glory fell adown her face, and gathered in her bright hair. The face was a trifle sad; from childhood, this had been a favorite hour with Ralph and herself; there was not a western window in all that grand, imposing edifice, from which they had not together watched old "Sol" go down behind the horizon, with all his ancient magnificence; whilst Ralph had delighted to dwell in anticipation on their home in the future, viewing it through the brilliant, glowing medium of sunset glory. Sztch was the anticipation, this was the reality, and she glanced sorrowfully at her black dress. "Charity, you will take cold."   HONOR BRIGHT.         179 She started; she had forgotten the present in the past; she shook her head negatively, not glancing at him. He waited a moment; she did not change her position, only to rest her head on her hand, thus partially turning her back to him. He wheeled his chair a trifle nearer, until she sat directly at his feet. In her absent-mindedness, she was not aware of his proximity, until one hand was laid upon her cheek, thus bringing her face full to meet his, whilst with the other hand he closed the casement. "You have never been accustomed to obeying," he said, looking coolly at her heightened color, and moving his hand from her check to the bright hair, as he spoke. "No, sir," haughtily; offended at his quietly exerted Will. "I have always been used to being obeyed," with most fantalizing coolness. "Yes, I know it," with an indignant tone in her voice. "Well?" as if expecting her to say more. "I shall not obey you, sir," defiantly. He smiled. "Yes, you will; you cannot help it. Your will is strong, very strong, I admit, but mine is iron. You will yield unconsciously to yourself," quietly. She flushed, moving restlessly. She knew that he had spoken truth, and fought against it with vain defiance. He continued in his clear, convincing manner of proving any position he choose to assume,- "The fact has been demonstrated twice within an hour, You wished to leave this room, making Birdie an excuse; I detained you against your will; then you exerted your curative' powers: if your will had been the stronger, I should have slept; as it was, you simply soothed and alleviated the pain. I knew just how much you could accomplisk before the effort." f  '  ' ;e   15 80      . HONOR BRIGHT. She looked troubled. He ontinued,- "There is but one thing in the world, in which I should find your will utterly inflexible." She had been watching him with a sort of dumb, re- sistless conviction; at that, she said a little eagerly, as "a drowning man catches at a straw," - "What?  "In a matter of right or wrong. It is the knowledge that- I could not tempt you to an untrue word or deed, and the consciousness of your power to keep with un- shaken fidelity, your motto ' Honor Bright,' that-" he paused, a faint flush swept lup to his very brow; then, with characteristic firmness, he added, smiling a little at himself as he did so, " commands my sincere respect." She first colored, then grew pale. Was it that cour- teous compliment? or that sudden, abrupt pause? She thanked him with a bit of reserve, averting her face. At that instant Clare Mallory passed the door, glancing in as he did so; neither of them were conscious of it, or saw the twang of jealous rage that contorted his handsome face, as he glided on to his study. Mr. Mallory had folded his arms, End was watching the changing color in the half-averted face before him. When next he spoke it was on a widely different subject: "Clare came to me this morning regarding a subject immediately concerning you." She started, looking at him questioningly. "Clare! me!" the recollection of that day in his study sweeping across her mind with a sort of horror. "He tells me that Selden wishes my consent, as your guardian, to address you." "I do not understand," she said in a perplexed tone. "He wants you to be his wife," smiling a little.   Her eyes flashed.  "He should have told' me that, not Clare," indignantly. "Your pardon; he should have. been brave enough to come to me," coldly, and looking searchingly at the girl's changing color.  She rested her head on her hand, with woman's tact veiling her heart by looking at him fearlessly.  Do you wish me to marry him, Mr. Mallory?" He started, his proud lips coming together firmly for a minute; then he asked almost angrily, - "Would you, if I did?" She arose, standing erect beside him, and replied, with a sort of queenly hauteur, - "No." He looked pleased. "Shall I send him to you for his answer? ' ' No; it had best be returned through the same source the question came. Clare can deliver it," with inimitable scorn.  "It will not satisfy him; there is not that man living who will accept his doom from any other than, the lips of the woman he loves," half seriously, half teasingly. She looked troubled; and, laying her, hand appealingly on his shoulder, said,-  "Mr. Mallory, if you will do this for me, you will save him some mortification, and me some paii." At that moment, the dinner-bell rang.  He arose, drawing her hand within his arm, with his courteous grace, saying kindly, as he led her frome the room, - "I will spare you so much of that as lies in my power." Yet, with the very promise on his lips, by his strange, irresistible fascination, the man was all unconsciously making her every pulse throb, her whole being vibrate 16   182'        HONOR BIGqHT. with pain, rendered all the more cruel from its very exquisiteness.

MARK MALLORY was right; Selden was not content until he had his answer from the girl's own lips. But, it was a full month ere she gave him opportunity; then he came on her unawares. ,It was a June afternoon; she had written constantly all day, and now, wearied out, had gone into the drawing-room, thinking to be alone, since it was Mrs. Mallory's custom to seek her in her own apartments, the moment her work was done, "to have a quiet bit of gossip," as the gentle lady styled it. It would be well if all gossip was of as loving and kindly sort, it being generally some funny characteristic remark or action of old Reliable, or some bright speech of Birdie's. She usually brought the child with her, too, saying, it   KHONOR BRIGHT.         183 would change the current of the girl's thoughts, and change was restful. This afternoon, strangely depressed and sad, the girl longed to be alone. She had wheeled an easy-chair up before one of the long French windows that opened on a veranda, and had 'sunk in it with a sort of hopelessness. The drawing-room was situated on that side of the build- ing that overhung the ravine, and this veranda, a little vine-clad affair, was suspended immediately over the pre- cipitous bluff. He had found her there, and love, conquering even the man's constitutional pusillanimity, he had plead his cause most earnestly, even eloquently. She had rejected his suit firmly, but with womanly gentleness. I His thin, weak lips had quivered with disappointment, for all he' bore it bravely, entreating, "since he might not hold a nearer, dearer relation, that she would at least accept him as a friend, and in proof thereof grant him one re- quest, namely, to promise never to be any man's wife without first telling him." She acquiesced, wondering at the strangeness of the request, as she did so. Then, thanking her humbly, he had left her. As he passed Clare's study, the humpback waylaid him, and looking keenly at him, said in a tone of malicious triumph, - "You believe, now?  "Yes;, but I did not choose to take your word for it," insolently. "Ha! ha! You will believe some other things, too, before long, like 'the devils who also believe and trem- ble,' " with that eldritch, metallic laugh. They were standing, confronting each other, the hump- back robed in a delicate dove-colored dressing-gown, his   184       EONOR BRIGHT. long, beautiful hair sweeping in waves over his deformed shoulders; the other, holding his hat in a fierce, nervous grasp. He seemed perfectly to understand Clare's mean- ing; the weak lips came together firmly,- - "Never!" "How would you prevent it; for your own honor, you dare not forbid the bans," in the insulting tone of one who knows his power, and glories in it. The weak face grew firm and strong with- hate; the lips, ashen and rigid, for a moment refused to part; when they did, he said in a fierce whisper, - "I would kill you, ere it should happen." Then, passing him, left the house with the air of one driven to desperation; the humpback laughed mockingly, and a few moments after, sought the drawing-room. When he entered he found Charity where we last saw her, with Birdie on her knee, and his mother in an easy- chair, busy with her fancy-work. Theyrad found the girl, and Mrs. Mallory had given ler a loving little scolding for running off from them. The day had been one of those sultry, oppressive ones that always fill in the latter part of June.. The sun had shone with fearful, intense brightness, and now had set with a terrible, still heat; not a breeze ruffled the brook in the ravine, or rustled the leaves even on the topmost boughs. Clare looked pale and exhausted; he scarcely noticed the little group, but passing them, went out at the long window upon the veranda, and threw himself on a rustic settee. Charity was leaning back in her chair, a trifle wearily, listening to the child's prattle. ,c Charity, dear, it is too bad to see a young girl in black all the time; wouldn't you wear white sometimes?"   'ONOR BRIGHT.         185 said Mrs. Mallory, dropping her work idly in her lap, and looking at the young girl. She shook her head negatively, a sad depressed expres- sion about her lips. "Why not, love; it would be so becoming, not but that you look pretty in black, too, but--" "Pshaw, mother! she looks more classical and spirit- ual as she is," interrupted Clare, leaning forward on the settee to see the girl. Truly she looked lovely! the soft grenadine falling in graceful folds, its. sombre hue relieved by a dainty, bit of white blonde, confined about the fair throat by an exquisite anchor of strung pearls, which Mrs. Mallory had made her accept; though, with characteristic pride and independence, she at first refused it, as she did the many other gifts she strove to press upon her. Birdie had been listening attentively, her little face perplexed as if striving to catch at something in the dim past. "Me yikes this," patting the black dress with her chubby hand, "' cause,- cause,- baby do yike it; cause --its yike baby's mamma's," the sunny face brightening and flashing, the tiny hands coming together in an earnest clasp, as if striving to retain the fleeting, thought. Charity intuitively glanced at Mrs. Mallory; her head was bent so closely over her embroidery, she could not see her face, but the gentle hands trembled so she scarce could guide her needle. Outside, Clare moved restlessly, as if he found the oaken settee anything but easy. Birdie, attracted by the noise, with childlike capri- ciousness, slipped from Charity's lap, toddling over to the window and peeping out, - "'Ou be kiet out yere, Care; me won't ayow such a noise."   186       HONOR BRIGHT. "Come here," said the humpback, holding out his hand winningly for her. "No; baby won't," shaking her head emphatically. He never could coax her to him. When she refused, he looked chagrined and angry. He even seemed jealous of the attentions of a little child. "This heat is terrible. If we only could have a storm," said Mrs. Mallory, nervously, and rising, she joined Clare on the veranda. Charity was looking beyond them to the deep, precipi- tous ravine, with the woods frowning and black against the sky, on its hither side. Her face was pale and troub- led. Who was this little creature's mainmma? and where was she? why had her child been torn from her arms? She wore black; there was a story of sadness even in that. Why had Mrs. Mallory brought her here,? Why were they called away thus suddenly those months ago? was the supposed solution of the apparent mystery every- where credited, the true one? Again the old, horrible, undefined doubt tormented her; yet everybody else be- lieved it; why should not she? Then the terrible, oppressive silence brooded over the earth, which always precedes a storm. Not a bird sang, nor a leaf rustled; all nature was hushed and expectant. Mrs. Mallory called Charity to come out on the veranda; just as she did so, Mark Mallory entered the drawing- I room, and a few moments after, joined them. "There is a storm brewing," he said. "Why, Mark, where do you see any sign? there's not a cloud even so large as a 'man's hand, nor the slightest breeze," said his mother, going over and standing beside him. "The intense quiet is the strongest proof." Charity was leaning on the iron trellis-work thllat I                  *  I   HONOR BRIGHT.         187 fformed the balustrade. Clare joined her; they were both looking down into the deep, rocky abyss; glancing up,'Charity met the humpback's eye; there was a wild, desperate gleam in it. "What a grand place this would be to commit suicide," he said in a low tone. She shuddered. ( What a terrible suggestion! How could you think of such a thing, Clare?" "How could I help thinking of it? You have heard of the fatal fascination some natures experience in look- ing over a precipice? mine is such. If I was brave enough, I would leap from  this railing to gratify the almost irresistible impulse." He was a creature of impulse, a slave to every passion the human heart harbors. She was thinking-thus; he was looking over the railing again. "I imagine now, I can hear my own dull, heavy fall among the rocks, startling this unearthly quiet- with a strain sweeter than any ever drawn from Apollo's lyre, because more weird, more strange; 'the last cry of a departing soul."' There was a wild, dreamy light on his handsome face. "Clare, go away from here," said the girl imperatively. Her will had wonderful control over his; he drew back, with a little sigh, throwing himself on the settee again. Mrs. Mallory resumed her seat beside him, taking Birdie on her lap. The heat grew more intense; the silence more oppres- sive ; the great heart of nature seemed to cease its beating, whilst the pulseless air hung heavy. It was "Between the dark and the daylight, When the night is beginning to lower."    188       HONOR BRIGHT. Dinner was announced; Mrs, Mallory bade it wait, since a dun line in the horizon promised relief; it was the fringed edge of a cloud. Then there was the faint rumbling of distant thunder; a little breeze tossed first leaf, then twig, and bough, growing rapidly, through strength and power, into a great wind; huge dark clouds rolled up from behind the horizon, and swept across the entire sky with alarming speed; the thunder became a continuous, crashing roar, echoing and reverberating with terrible power through the deep mountain gorge, over which they hung; the wind came with a mighty, rushing sound, like the "roar of many waters," and the storm brooded threateningly over them. Clare grew pale, as if about to faint, shrinking and trembling with that constitutional terror so many have of a storm. Mrs. Mallory had gone in, carrying Birdie 'with her. Mark was standing with folded arms, calmly watching the increasing tempest. Charity, chancing to glance at the humpback, saw him white with terror; her face revealed that pity always accorded to a weak nature by a strong one, since, when nobility of soul is added to strength, contempt is only felt for what is wrong. Her pity seemed galling to him. TIt is all you ever give me," he said, bitterly. She made no reply; so, pale and trembling, he arose and weht into the drawing-room, throwing himself on a sofa. His mother drew her chair beside him; outside, the storm raged, increasing with fearful power. The thunder knew no. cessation, for ere the echo of one loud crash could grow faint, another took 'up the roar; the heavens were black as ebony; in the ravine, the brook leaped and tossed, swelling its banks, and above, on the mountain-side, the woods swayed to and fro, bowing low, as if to appease, through humility, the angry storm-wind;   HONOR BRIGHT.         189 X: Ewhilst streaks of forked lightning shot athwart the sullen sky, bringing each angle of the rambling building, each tree, each sharp ledge of rock, aye, even each tiny pebble in the bottom of the deep'ravine, into terrible relief. "Charity, love, had you not- better come in?" called Mr. Mallory, anxiously. "4 In a few minutes; not yet; the air is as exhilarating as new wine," was the reply. Mr. Mallory glanced at the grl; she was standing with one arm thrown about the slight iron pillar, her black dress flowing gracefully in the wind; her bright hair partly loosened, blown back from her brow; her face flooded with a holy awe, a rapturous love. ' He stood beside her. "What are you thinking of?" a trifle abruptly. She replied, with a touch of timid hesitancy in her tone, " i'Darkness was upon the face: of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters; ' I al- -ways unconsciously felt it in such storms as this." A louder peal of thunder than any preceding prevented his reply. The wind increased, lashing the earth with mad fury. He glanced a little uneasily at the slight iron veranda, or balcony, suspended as it was, in mid-air, from the side of the massive stone building. "I trust this is safe," he said. "I have watched as fierce storms from it from my childhood," she replied, her face clouding a little with sad memories. "Do you know what fear is?" he asked, looking at her curiously. She laughed lightly. i "I have never had anything to make me afraid yet, Mr. Mallory?" He looked amused, glancing from her face to the storm.   190       HONOR BRIrGHT. She was so totally unlike the women he had been wont to meet, with her strong, womanly nature,-her almost Roman-courage. He had been accustomed to the pretty, painted creatures of fashion, with their ephemeral bril- liancy, and fast-fading beauty, who spent their winters in dissipation, their summers at" fashionable watering-places; who were wont to faint at a startling incident, and go into a paroxysm of pretty, affected terror, at a storm - creatures who could not even comprehend that noble term of honor, woman. It was little wonder he should look at-this girl in astonishment, or ask'curiously,- "WMat would make you afraid, Charity?" She turned a trifle pale, saying coldly, and looking at him with searching fearlessness, "The knowledge of a sin, whether coimmitted by myself or simply by another." He smiled. "That is a strange answer; but just such as I might have expected from you." She drew a little breath of relief, her doubt flung back. The storm grew in power; their voices sounded like whispers in the midst of its rush and roar. The trees stooped until they kissed the very earth; and many a staunch old wrestler with the storms of years fell, stricken; the clouds increased in density; the thunder and the lightning repeatedly met. At length the tempest burst; a few large, presaging drops of rain spattered upon the parched ground; then it fell in torrents; the wind dashed it in their faces; they drew back, but it penetrated to the very casement, so driving them in. They joined the little group already gathered there, Birdie slipping down from Mrs. Mallory's lap to climb upon Mark's knee. They were perfectly silent, listening to the mighty moving of the storm.; awed at the power of the Almighty. Clare was lying back among the cush-   zHONOR BRIGHBT.         191 i jions, pale as death, and utterly exhausted. Little Birdie sat with her tiny hands clasped, listening in wonder and unconscious reverence. At length its wrath seemed well- nigh spent; the flashes of lightning became less frequent and less vivid; the thunder abated its crashes, and sunk into a hoarse, deep murmur, above which they could hear the gurgling of the swollen brook; whilst the rain ceased its dashing, and fell with a piteous, wailing sound. Lit- tle Birdie listened, her very lips parted in her earnestness, her sunny face perplexed and questioning. At length the dim flash of memory became distinct; she said with a sad eagerness, strangely sorrowful in childhood,- "Baby's mamma cry yike that, Mark; Baby's mamma do."  It was a startling effect that little, sad reminiscence caused. Mrs. Mallory's very lips quivered with her effort to keep back her tears. Clare turned pale as death, his beautiful face working convulsively; whilst the mas- ter changed color, his proud face growing fixed and stern, then softening at those pleading, baby eyes, whilst he stooped and kissed the little creature. Charity looked from one to the other, not in amaze, not even wondering, but with a terrible conviction and prescience. "Baby wants her mamma; Baby do," and the soft lips quivered pitifully. Mr. Mallory arose, took her in his arms, and carried her about the room, diverting her attention with that 'rare fascination that even little children feeLt Clare had shielded his face with his white, delicate hand; and Mrs. Mallory, saying  something about ordering dinner, had left the room;  Charity was watching the master with eager, troubled eyes.+ A few moments after the dinner-bell rung.

That night when Charity went to her room, she found Old Reliable there waiting for her, seated in her custom- ary position before the fire. She often found her there at night, so felt no surprise, but drew a low chair to the opposite side of the hearth, and sitting down, began to take down her long, bright hair. It fell in a sweep- ing, golden veil all adown her shoulders, and about her fair face. There had been a bit of strategy in it; she wanted to hide that face, with its concealed trouble, from the -keen eyes behind the double glasses.          i "Charity, I felt as if I must come in here and take care of you, child," she said in her blunt way, adjusting her glasses. The girl started, sweeping back her hair. "Take care of me, Reliable; why, what for?" in alarm. "That's just it! I don't know what for; but it's some- thing, or I wouldn't feel it," in a perplexed tone. 'The girl laughed a little relieved laugh, though it had a troubled ring, too. "Oh! is that all! nothing tangible; only an imagin- ary evil. I did not think you superstitious, Reliable." "You needn't laugh, child; I'm confident it's no laugh- ing matter, whatever it is," said the woman shortly. Then there was a little silence; Charity broke it, shad- ing her face a little, with her golden sheen, as she did so. "Reliable, did you ever wonder who Birdie's mamma is?" "Humph!" was the characteristic reply; then, after a bit, with a little sniff, "I reckon the child must have a father, too." X                .    HON2OR BRIGHT.           193 The girl turned pale.

"What, Reliable?" the voice coming very faint from its golden screen. "I think we have both seen him," coolly. She reeled in her chair. "Reliable, speak more plainly," she said in a voice low and strained with anguish. "I don't know, rightly, child.  How can I? but it's one of the two." CHAPTER    XV11.

Clare, spent and weary from the enervating effects of yesterday's heat, was unable to write; so, at the break- fast-table, Mrs. Mallory proposed that they should all spend the day in the ravine, taking their lunch with them, adding, glancing anxiously at Charity's white, troubled face, as she spoke, "' that it would do others than Clare good, too." Clare was as pleased as a boy with the plan. Mr. Mallory, being obliged to go first to the furnace, promised to meet them at lunch, Charity telling him where to find them, as, when the meal was finished, he went out to his waiting buggy. Charity and Clare started ahead, to select the spot, followed by a servant, carrying a huge basket of good things, which Reliable had put up; Mrs. Mallory was to follow in a few moments with Birdie and the nurse. When they reached the almost perpendicular side of the rocky, mountain gorge, Charity ran down the steep, natural steps with the graceful agility of a mountain lassie; when mid-way she turned and glanced up; Clare was standing on the brink, looking down with a certain dread and hopelessness. She went back to him quickly. c( Give me your hand, Clare. I forgot that you were not used to climbing; it was inconsiderate of me," she said, with woman's delicacy attributing the difficulty all to the steep descent. He laid his hand in hers with a bitter sigh. "It's not that. Mark would go down with a bound. It's my cursed misfortune that calls forth your pity or assistance at every turn.' She paid no attention, but began leading him down as gently as if he had been a child. The servant, carefully picking his way, had almost reached the bottom. As they went, occasionally a loosened stone rolled down into the   HONOR BRIGfT.         195 J Jravine, sounding, as it struck the bottom, scarce louder than the dropping of a pin, through the immense depth. Clare grew pale. "Charity, I reel like a man drunk; I shall fall, surely," in a tone of terror. "Clare, you cannot; I have hold of your hand," reas- suringly, but looking startled at his increasing pallor. "What of that; I should drag you down with me." She shuddered, intuitively, and threw her arm partially about his slight, swaying figure, saying in a firm, impera- tive tone, "Clare, do :not look below; either keep your eyes fastened on the opposite bank, or close them." He obeyed implicitly, choosing the latter alternative. She led him down, step by step; he not speaking again, but trembling and passive in her hands;' she continually reassuring him with, "Now, we are almost half-way- now quite--now, a few steps more, and you shall open your eyes again." When at length, they did reach the bottom, he threw himself, pale with terror, and faint with exhaustion, on the lowest step to rest. Charity took a silver mug from the basket the servant bore, and running to the stream filled it with the clear, sparkling water, and brought it to the humpback, saying lightly," "Drink! it is a draught more life-giving than the nectar of the gods." It proved such. , He thanked her, saying, "It was not the nectar that gave new life, so much as the beautiful face of the ' Ganymedes' who presented it; " then declar- ing himself rested, insisted on going on; but Charity pos- itively refused to go one step farther until the rest of the party joined them. At   length they saw them standing timidly on the brink. Charity summoned the servant, who had withdrawn   to a respectful distance, to carry Birdie down, whilst she climbed the steep ascent to give   196       HONOR BRIGHT. her hand to Mrs. Mallory. The humpback, sick and dizzy, even in watching the others, arose, turning his back on them, and sauntering slowly to the bank of the blight, bubbling brook. A few minutes after, they all joined him, his mother saying in delight, "Clare, could anything be more beautiful or romantic!" whilst Birdie, in the nurse's arms, laughed gleefully, piping pretty, lisp- ing exclamations, such as, "Baby yikes this, baby do." Charity led the way, her face, which had been so sad and white at breakfast, flushed with exercise, and bright with hope. Since the girl had acknowledged her Maker, there was no sorrow dark enough to cloud that great joy utterly. Now she was thankful for life, since there was life eternal; the mere living was beautiful, since the love which consecrated that living filled it to completeness. For a little, last night, in the anguish of the earthly, she had lost sight of the heavenly love ; ,but now, the heavenly, conquering, had purified the earthly, and ena- bled her to " suffer and be strong." They followed the brook about a quarter of a mile; then where the ravine made an abrupt curve, a sharp angle of the rock forming a complete and perfect shade, the young girl paused. "Oh! but this is lovely I like the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.' Doesn't it make you think of it, love?" said Mrs. Mallory, in her gentle, winsome way. Charity nodded with a little, pleased smile. The man put down the basket and returned home; little Birdie slipped to the ground, the nurse following her about in her play, whilst the others sat down on the rude, natural seats to rest., So the morning passed; sometimes they wandered about the ravine, gathering mosses' from the time-stained rocks, or pebbles from the brook; always coming back to   I:1            ZTHONfOR BRIGHT.        197 this their first resting-place. Once Charity and Clare were seated there alone, Mrs. Mallory being down on the brook's side with little Birdie. They had been out on a geological research, and had their laps full of stones and bits of rocks as specimens. Clare, being now in the shade, took off his cap, gathering them all in the crown. He looked unusually handsome; his cheeks were flushed; his dark, eloquent eyes, vivid and lustrous; whilst the breeze toyed gracefully with his long, wavy hair. Charity, with her keen appreciation of the beautiful, could scarce keep her eyes off his face. Intuitively he felt her unexpressed admiration; it always acted with the exhilaration of wine on his spirits; they rose accord- ingly. He was brilliant, entertaining; she was fairly dazed and bewildered by his wondrous powers. He was proving geology a strong evidence of Deity, rather than a plea for atheism. She had studied it only in the latter light; now it was disclosed to her in the other, enhanced by all the beauty of imagery and meta- phor, and the loftiness of eloquence. At length, with one of those capricious impulses that constantly swayed him, he paused abruptly, changing the subject,- "Charity, do you remember what I said to you coming down the bluff, a little while ago?" "No; what, Clare?" looking surprised. "You told me I had no cause to fear, since you held my hand." "Yes," wonderingly. "I replied, 'what of that? I would drag you down with me.'" "Well, what of it, Clare? I never could endure any- thing savoring of riddles," impatiently. "That conversation might be taken in another than a literal sense," looking at her with intense, burning eyes;   198  *     HONOR BRIGET. then continuing, "If I was standing on the brink of a more precipitous abyss, and should stretch out my hand entreating you to take it, would you refuse?" "Clare, I positively decline conversing in figures," she said coldly. He paid no attention, but went on with a wild, amor- ous desperation, that looked like insanity, and made the. girl shudder. "You have done so already! I stretched out my hand to you; you turned from the appeal. It is well for you that you did! my innate caducity would have conquered!  nothing could- save me! and I should have dragged you with me! 'the strongest fall;' the Bible says so. Be- ware! then, that I catch not hold of your righteous skirts, even yet," with a mocking, satirical laugh. Charity was frightened; was the man sane? She laid - her hand soothingly on his shoulder. "Clare, do not talk so, I beg; it sounds like raving." Again the rocks reverberated with that elfish laugh, until the very echoes caught it up. The girl, nothing daunted by the sneer it held, contin- ued, in a half soothing, half cold tone of reasoning, "Clare, I wish you would give up Spiritualism, and return to the faith of your childhood; as Shakespeare says, - 'It is not, and it cannot come to goodA There is always a curse follows it I Who of its profes- sors ever were prospered?"' He shook off her hand petulantly. "I will not endure your pity any longer! You plant yourself on a pinnacle of cold reasoning and icy logic, as if a creature only of brain, utterly destitute of heart; then, with haughty condescension, stoop pityingly over -          *   common mortals like me! It galls me! I'll not bear it another hour! -Why do you not treat me as you do Mark? Has his cool, clear head, and utter lack of im- pulse, the charm? or his iron will, that makes him an indomitable tyrant? or his rare fascination, that I have heard of from childhood, but never could discover? Surely, I have as good a right as he!" She had risen, and was regarding him in haughty silence. He'went on with the recklessness of passion,-   6 (' You think I will give you up to him! Ha! ha! ha! He has no right to any woman. I'll compass heaven and earth, aye, even hell, but what-" "Clare Mallory!" The voice was quiet, not one whit above conversational tone, but the latent command in it made the humpback pause and think, growing deathly pale as he did so. "Charity, forgive' me! I was mad, desperate, raving! It shall never happen again!" in wild entreaty. She regarded him with cold. hauteur. "You have broken your word once! I shall never trust you again," she said, and left him,joining Mrs. Mallory and Birdie. The tone had been incisive and trenchant as steel; the humpback's startlingly beautiful face writhed and con- torted; he buried it in his hands, muttering, "I love her so, I could kill her, to' feel that even dead she was mine! mine, she Ahall be!" and the full, voluptuous lips came firmly together. Mrs. Mallory had taken off Birdie's shoes and stockings, and the little creature was paddling in the brook, her sunny face fairly flashing with fun and frolic. As Charity joined them, she cried, ".Pretty, see Baby's yittie toes; see!" splashing the water with the wee, pink-tipped affairs, as she spoke. *    2UU       HONOR BRIGtHT.              /! Charity laughed, sitting down on the bank beside her, and catching the ten tiny toes out of the water to cover them with kisses. "Baby won't ayow 'ou to kiss Baby's yittie toes!

"Why, Mark, where did you come from?" asked his mother.                - "Mark, Pretty kiss Baby's yittie toes, and Baby fro water at her, Baby do," said the child earnestly, kicking the water all the while. He laughed at the lisping description of the episode. It was quite unnecessary, since he had witnessed it. He  1 was standing with folded arms, his panama hat just a! trifle pushed back from his brow, as if to catch all the( breeze. The young girl was wiping her face and shaking the water from her sunny hair; glancing up, she met the quizzical, light-blue eye. "Where is your hat? You will be terribly tanned,' he said. "It is-full of'stones," indifferently. "You do not care so much for your complexion as some young ladies I have met," he said lightly, and as he spoke, he took his panama from his own head and put it on hers.' There was something in the movement plainly said he cared. The girl blushed consciously; he laughed at the heightened color, looking at the face under the panama with those cool, critical, connoisseur eyes of his,   HONOR BRKIGHT.         201 whilst Birdie, seeming to think it had been done wholly for her amusement, clapped her wee hands in high glee. Then Mrs. Mallory summoned the nurse to put on the child's shoes and stockings, and they went to the shadow of the rock, to where Clare was waiting. He had been watching them; as they approached, he glanced in jeal- ous rage at the girl in his brother's hat. She caught the expression, and lifted the hat with a cold bow of mock courtesy. He did not return the salutation, but glanced at his brother, saying sneeringly, - "Better be sunstruck oneself than sully the dazzling hue of Beatrice's fair face." Charity did not glance at Mr. Mallory, but flushed to her very brow, holding the hat she had justheen about to thank him for mutely extended toward him. Nothing ever confused Mark Mallory; his quiet dig- nity was proof against any disturbing incident. He took the hat with his customary grace, saying indifferently, to his brother,- "I am cool-headed, you 'know; the sun has no effect on me," and as he spoke, he threw himself lazily on the smooth rock, resting his elbow on one of the natural seats, his head on his hand. The question is, which is the cooler, your head or your heart, Mark. I believe, if you would consent toa 'post-mortem,' the physicians would find you an anomaly, or a sort of monstrosity, the heart being located in the head, its lobes so indissolubly united, and fused with the brain, that they would have to class the two together, and call it as a whole, Reason or Will, whichever you prefer." The voice was full of the effort to restrain passion, that always characterized 'the humpback's conversation with his brother.   HONOR BRIGHT.         *!- Mrs. Mallory was unpacking the basket, her gentle face troubled and anxious. "Why, Clare, dear, how could you 'think of anything so horrible ? " she interrupted, gently.  Mr. Mallory had only laughed indifferently. Charity glanced almost wonderingly.at his cool, immobile face. "Was Clare right ?" The girl was spreading the cloth over one of the largest and flattest of the rocks, and arranging the good things on the table thus improvised, as Mrs. Mallory took them from the basket. It was a repast dainty and tempting; delicate, white rolls; snowy biscuits, sliced with the pink- est of ham; green, juicy pickles; and hard-boiled eggs; then, a pitcher of sweet, rich milk  apple pie, and cheese; cold chicken; sponge-cake, yellow as gold; strawberries and cherries; a bowl of yellow custard, with eggs beaten to snow, floating about on its surface; and heaps of other dainties. Mrs. Mallory, having emptied the basket, spread her shawl, and sat down lazily at the head of the table, to wait until Charity had all arranged. .The brothers were watching her occupied with these graceful domestic duties, so pretty in woman. Once their eyes met; it was a strange look the men exchanged; that of the elder was keen, cold, questioning; that of the younger flushed, and excited, marked, too, with that usual effort for control. Clare was the first to glance away. At that moment, everything being arranged, the girl turned, clapping her hands gayly, after the fashion of the old game, and crying lightly, 'Bread, butter, blue beans; please to come to supper."  Clare obeyed the summons instantly, rolling a small stone over beside his mother; Mark followed lazily, sit- ting on the flat rock opposite his brother. Charity ran   HONOR -BRIGHT.                .203 to call the nurse to bring Birdie; when she came back, there were two vacant places, one beside each brother. Instantly she saw the position; it seemed as if she must forever be choosing between these two. Clare said eagerly,- "Charity, there is room by me." Mr. Mallory said nothing, did not even glance at her. With characteristic decision, and fearlessness as to What construction might be put upon her action, she took the seat beside him, saying lightly, "I am accustomed to hav- ing you opposite me, Clare." The humpback's beautiful face grew dark. Mr. Mal- lory did not glance either at him or the girl; but, accus- tomed to the head of the table, waited on her plate. Even that little act seemed' to give Glare a jealous twang. Wherever McGregor sits is the head of the table,"' he said with a sneer. Mrs. Mallory looked distressed; Charity, annoyed; Mark, provokingly cool and nonchalant. Little Birdie's entrance, at that moment, was a general relief. Oh! the blessing of little children! How they fill up and bridge over every great hiatus in our lives! with their pretty prattle taking away our embarrassments; calming our angry moods; with their winsome sympathy, cheering our despondency, and soothing our sorrows! Then, too, they are not only our comforters, but our guar- dians. It is hard, aye, almost impossible to commit a sin in the presence of a little child, about whom the Creator still casts a halo of holy innocence. They are our greatest safeguards; they make the household glad and bright; they bind the wife to the husband, the husband to the wife, with strongest bonds of love and fidelity; they wield a mighty, untold influence over the whole world! Let us thank God, then, for little children!  HONOR BRIG HT. Birdie made the meal merry; they all caught her humor; after a bit, even Clare laid aside his acrimony, and condescended to be entertaining, joining in the con- versation, and every little while suspending it to sing a wild, rollicking drinking song, giving as his plea, when his mother laughingly corrected him, "that etiquette belonged to four walls; the birds eat and sing together, occupying the same grand, universal dining-hall. 'When in Rome, one must do as the Romans.'" Then, too, littte Birdie filled up any occasional pause, with, " Baby want yots of strawberries, her do," eating them with her wee fingers. " Haven't you any wine, mother ?" asked Clare, when the dinner was almost finished. 'Yes, Clare, dear," a-little hesitatingly; "but don't let us open the bottle, So far, this has been a day in Nature; let us finish it so. Shall I give you some milk ? " The humpback laughed mockingly. "Whatever has Nature against wine?    Didn't the same earth yield grapes and strawberries? That is a woman's illogical opinion," and as he spoke, he leant back to the basket, and took out a bottle. His mother's gentle face was clouded; she offered no further resistance. It seemed as if he could not live without stimulants; his thirst was insatiable, yet you could not call the man a drunkard. He drew the cork a little angrily, with his white, nervous hand; then, filling a glass, passed it to Charity. She declined. "What ! not even to drink my health ? " hotly. "Not in that," and as she spoke, she raised a goblet of pure, sparkling water to her lips, adding, " To the good, and noble qualities in your nature, that should conquer ,very other." He blushed like a girl, hesitating a moment, not know-   ing whether to be atngry or pleased; then his better na- ture conquering, with the impulse that ruled him, he dashed the bottle against the rocks. There was a flush of pleasure on Mrs. Mallory's face, whilst Charity turned a trifle pale, trembling at the in- fluence she possessed. Mark, alone, seemed indifferent; he had finished his dinner, and was watching the group in an absent, troubled sort of way. For an instant there was an embarrassed silence; Birdie broke it, pointing to the wine, red on the rocks, and lisping, "MWhat yots of gavy!" They all laughed, and Clare, drinking a deep draught of clear water, sang merrily, - "'Let's banish business, banish sorrow; To the gods belong to-morrow.' After that he seemed determined to make good iis song; for the livelong afternoon the wild, rocky ravine rang with his mirth. At length, when the servant came to carry home the basket, with another of his capricious, sudden freaks, he arose to accompany him. His mother tried to persuade him to stay, and when every effort proved futile, insisted on going with him, but he declined her offer, in an impa- tient, virulent tone. . Charity alone guessed his true motive, or suspected that it was a morbid, sensitive pride, that made him ashamed to have any, even his own mother, witness his weakness and terror in ascending the difficult bluff. When he had gone there was silence; the nurse had carried Birdie farther down the ravine to play, Mrs. Mallory had taken out her worsted, and was crocheting; Charity, too, was working rich colors into canvas, for a chair for little Birdie. 18   ,06        HONOR BRIGHT. Mark threw himself with a lazy sort of grace at his mother's feet. When Clare had been there, he had taken his full share in the conversation; now he was silent, his head resting on his hand, his panama hat drawn low over his brow. His mother thought- him sleeping, and kept up a steady stream of gentle small-talk, in a lows tone, discussing some pretty new dresses she meant to   : make for Birdie,1'and other womanish topics. Charity, was apparently' listening, but at length her hands fell idly in her lap, whilst she gazed dreamily out at the brook, with the sunlight scintillating on its ripplingsur- face. Suddenly, both eyes and thoughts came back from their discursive wanderings to the actual present, meet- ing the blue eyes under the panama, that all uncon- sciously to herself had summoned them. "What did you see in the brook, Charity  Birdie's new dress?" quizzically. "What do you say, Mark? Birdie in the brook?"      l cried Mrs. Mallory, looking as if about to faint with terror. , Charity had been annoyed, but at that, could not help laughing; whilst Mark, with that quiet air of amusement, hastened to explain to his mother. She could not be  convinced, though, until she heard the child's prattle, and caught sight of her in the distance; even then, the gentle hands trembled over their worsted, and she called him, with loving reproach, ".her naughty, teasing boy." Mark Mallory a boy! This man who had amassed an almost fabulous fortune! This man of mighty intellect and unbounded influence, a boy! The girl smiled. And yet there was something boyish about him, after all. His face was smooth, and when free from care, as now, looked far less than his thirty-five years; and there was the   HO1NOR BRIGHT..        207 careless abandonment of a school-boy in his lazy position now, at his mother's feet. He caught the smile, and answered it, saying lightly,- "You have heard Clare's opinion of me, and now mother's; they differ slightly "    a "Yes." "What is yours?" coolly. She colored, and bit her lips. "Why, Mark, how unreasonable, to expect her to dis- cuss you right to your face. Never mind his teasing, love," said Mrs. Mallory, siding with the girl. Charity had resumed her work, bending closely over it; he was waiting, with his quiet persistence; she knew it, and drew her bright worsted all the more sedulously through the canvas. Suddenly the work was suspended; he had reached over and laid his hand, with that wilful determination peculiar to him, on both of hers in her ,lap. "You might' as well yield, Charity., If he has made up his mind, he will know," said his mother, laughing a little fond, proud laugh. The girl chafed under his iron will, and bit her lip nervously, looking at the hand in her lap. It was a firm, shapely hand, and full of character, yet white, and with as delicate vein-tracery as a woman's. There was some- thing wondrous winning about it; the girl's cheek grew bright at the touch. "Well?" questioningly.. "I told you once. I have not changed my opinion. I think you are a tyrant," she said defiantly, flashing a quick look at him. "There, it serves you right, Mark," said his mother, laughingly.                ' ,.   208       HONOR BRIGHT. He drew away his hand, but not his eyes; he liked her fearlessness.  "Come, children, no more quarrelling; we must go home. It is almost dinner time," said Mrs. Mallory,  glancing at her watch, and afterward rolling up her work. Charity followed her example. Mrs. Mallory went to call the nurse and Birdie; Mark arose with a yawn; as he did so, he espied the girl's hat in a ledge of the rock, full of stones; he picked it up with an air of amusement. "What is to be done with these?" She came toward him, folding up the corners of her dainty, white apron for reply; he emptied them all in. She gathered the apron into one hand, holding out the other for her hat; but he paid no attention, did not seem to see it, placing the hat on the bright hair himself, and as he tied it under the oval chin, said provokingly, "So Clare has told you you look like Beatrice?" She flushed, biting her lips in annoyed silence. ' Did he tell ypu I said so?" persistently, stooping a little to see the more plainly to tie the black ribbon. Still no answer.; "You do. I thought so the day you guided me to the  Institute. That is how you suggested our unique library," with marked emphasis on the possessive pronoun; then added, teasingly-, You know you look like her,"   HFONOR BRIGHT.           209 CHAPTER XVIII. "Bind. the sea to slumber stilly, Bind the odor to the lily, Bind the aspen ne'er to quiver, Then bind love to last forever."  T. CAMPBELL. "Woman, .thy woes are traced in sand, 13ut older, firmer hearts than os, Have found monotony in loving." BYRON. FOR the next two weeks Clare Mallory kept this girl of whom we are telling, constantly employed. He took her time and called it his, scarce leaving her a moment which she could claim as her own. Labor, with an easy mind, can scarce rightly be called labor. If your whole heart and soul are in your task, the attributes that constitute the term are lost, and task be- comes choice. Did you ever note the difference in men? If a man is happily married, he is almost sure to be an industrious man. The bright, helpful faces of wife and children will utterly overcome any constitutional laziness he may feel; with such an incentive work is mere pleasure. It is generally these henpecked husbands, continually found fault with by jealous, exacting wives, who become inert, and earn the term  of opprobrium, "do-little."   You may set it down as a homely truth, that nine-tenths of the land-ladies, or boarding-house-keepers, whose hbus-    I bands are living, are shrews. Light-hearted work never yet wearied any body.   It 18*   -!"V       BONOR sRIGHT, depends wholly on the heft of the heart we carry with us to our task:  "Work I work I it is healthy But worry is pale."  So the fault all lay in the girl's heart. In it there was a constant warfare between  faith and doubt toward  human nature, and the conflict blanched her cheeks. She was tormented and beset. She loved-- was it an ideal, or a real living man? Were the truth, the honor, the nobility of soul actual, tangible? or- She never fin-  ished the doubt even to herself, but thought of little Birdie, and shuddered.  This world is a masquerade on a large scale. Every   one has his domino! and it is well they do; for if we  might see each face as the true mirror of its soul'! O  God! Pandemonium would be an Elysium in comparison!  i The hideous contortions! the frightful deformities!   I This girl longed, with ruthless hand, to tear away the ' masks, to rend the veils, and see the truth. The Egyp-  tian hieroglyphic for God, was an eye resting on a seep- tre, emblematic of his seeing all things, and ruling all things. She, with unconscious, impious daring, was cov- eting that sight which belongs alone to Deity. She felt caged, bound hand and foot in this prison-house- of sus- picion and doubt; and as a  bird ceases his song, and beats his bright plumage against his bars in pitiable desperation, so this girl grew pale and silent in her vain efforts. With her strong, decided nature, in acknowledg ing her God, she had given him the greatest love of which her being was capable. But the same God who claimed that love, had implanted in her heart the capacity for this other love. So, when it came, with its wild impor- tunities, she crouched before it in dumb anguish, with %              *   HONOR BRIGHT.         2" her long accustomed self-reliance striving to solve the doubt and meet the solution stoically, forgetting to cast her care on Him "'who careth for us." Old Reliable had never once breathed her thought since that night. She had no need, since Charity under- stood every expression of the parchment-like face, and saw there as plainly as if written in the clear type of the printed, page, suspicion, conviction, certainty, and above all, anxiety for her. But, for all she knew the outward sign, she lacked the " open sesame " to the real thought- thus brred. Mark Mallory was much at home during these two weeks, and in the afternoons, the moment Charity was free, he claimed her, leading her with his quiet, graceful determination, out on one of the many odd verandas and balconies about the building to catch the air, or out on the velvet lawn to see the sunset; or on the edge of the. bluff, to face the breeze as it swept up cool and strong from the mountain gorge. Many times he proposed driving in a party to the fur- nace by moonlight, to see them cast, but such nights as the iron was to be cast, something always prevented,- either calls from the town or surrounding country, or else Clare broke the party by saying he was tired, until at length the plan seemed fated. Charity had few rides during these two weeks, Clare claiming her assistance the moment breakfast was finished. Mrs. Mallory often regarded her pale, weary face with anxiety, whilst Old Reliable looked a t it indignantly, and passed the study door many times more during the day than she could possibly have calls. Charity, with her face low over her task, never saw her, but the humpback did, and set his full, sensuous lips firmly; he seemed to hate the woman.   212       HONOR BRIGHT. Now it was an afternoon; Clare had just declared him- self tired. The girl left his study, and went languidly to her own room to refresh herself. When she opened the door, she found Mrs. Mallory there, waiting for her; as she entered, the lady approached her, and putting her   0 arm fondly around her, said,-- "I have a great favor to ask of you, love; will you grant it?" "Yes, 'to the half of my kingdom.'" was the reply, with a little effort for gayety. Mrs. Mallory led her to the bed-side for answer. On it was spread a delicate white mull dress, with ruffled skirt, and dainty lace at the throat and wrists; whilst carelessly looped over it, was a wide, black sash. The girl changed color. "Wear it for my. sake, love! I cannot bear to see you in mourning! I put it on when only a year or two older than you, and have never had it off since," her gentle voice choked with emotion. "It shall be as you wish. It is a lovely dress; I thank you for it," very gratefully. Mrs. Mallory waited to see her dressed, then kissing her with fond admiration, left her.  A  few moments after, Charity sauntered slowly down the broad stairway, and through the marbled hall. She met, no one. Where was the master? She had grown to look for him; he was nowhere to be seen. She missed him. She did not go near the lawn, nor the blufs. She had no inclination.  The corridors were very still; no sound save her light foot-step on the marble tiling. She left them, and entered the drawing-room. It was grand, in its oriental splendor, as some sultan's apartment in Moorish harem. She passed carelessly through the room, stepping out on the veranda which we have already described;   NHONOR BRIGHT.         213, there stood to watch the sunset alone. She looked very lovely, the sunlight streaming adown her bright hair and the graceful folds of her white, fleecy dress. She seemed " to the manor born," this girl. Every grace sat well upon her; yet she had been brought to the Institute, the orphan babe of an unsuccessful artist., whose gentle wife had died in giving birth to this their only child; he following hiswife to her untimely grave in less than a year. So the Institute record read. Mark Mal- lory stood regarding her from the French window, with much these thoughts, for some five minutes before she discovered his presence; then he came and stood beside her, regarding her provokingly, admiration blended with his keen, artistic acumen. She flushed, a trifle an- noyed. "I was afraid you would not wear it," he said. "You knew of it?" starting, the color deepening. He smiled. "Mother and I are alike in our tastes," lightly. For a moment her lips quivered; then with the honest ! pride that admits of gracefully accepting a gift, she said,- "Please share your mother's thanks." He looked annoyed, as he always did at gratitude. What had been the man's experience, that thanks shold be so hateful to him? she wondered; and, with her frag  fearlessness, told him so. His proud face grew firm, almost to rigidity. He did not answer her question; a moment there was silence; then his face softened its hard, tense lines, and with that slight, imperious gesture pecu- liar to him, he abruptly changed the subject. "Clare has made a very slave of you, lately." "He has had more than usual to do," indifferently. "My mother says you have a wonderful influence over 'll,    214       HONOR BRIGHT., She looked annoyed. '"You do not like it?" in a surprised tone. 'No," frankly, Why? Most of girls would be proud to rule such a mind as Clare's." "You are mistaken; I simply, at times, control his fickle impulse." He looked a trifle astonished at her astute discrimina- tion. His next remark was a question. Mark Mallory dealt in abrupt questions; he had found them the key to many an occult thing, both in business and other matters; he had the clear, keen, discerning faculties of a lawyer. "Did Clare ever ask you to be his wife?"' It was put so naturally, it immediately received an un-  equivocal, -- "Yes," though she bit her lip in annoyance the next instant. "And -you?" questioningly.  "Refused him, of course," with very palpable inpa- tience. "Why, of course,'?" coolly. She flashed a defiant look at him. "Mr. Mallory, why this catechizing?" He looked amused, but waited persisently for her answer. "He is wonderfully gifted; has more beauty than the Greeks allowed Apollo Belvidere, and - " She interrupted him petulantly,-- "You need not enumerate the list. You cannot ad- mire his talent and beauty more than I do; but--" she hesitated.  He waited in silence, so she conitinued, a 'trifle impa- tiently,-    EONOR BRIGHT.         215 "What do they all go for, since the one great requisite is lacking?" "And that is --" persistently. She looked fearlessly into his cool, searching eyes, and answered, - "Love." He smiled. "You would not mayry without love, then?" "No!" her breath coming in little smothered gasps, yet regarding him quietly, with her'strong self-control. "Mr. Mallory, why did you ask me about Clare?" He laughed a light, bitter laugh. "Because Clare and I thought we loved the same woman, once." Thought?" questioningly, and turning a trifle pale. "Yes; thought. We found it a delusion," in a hard tone; then, with another of those abrupt changes, "Do you remember our talk about- constancy?" She nodded assent absently, her thoughts going out to this woman, whom they thought they had loved, these two men. "This case that I have been citing was an illustration of my opinion on that subject," with cold cynicism. She looked at him eagerly, striving to trace the links of con- nection, and comprehend this thing, that she intuitively felt had made this man the sceptic that he was. He was standing beside her, leaning against one of the slight iron pillars, his arms folded calmly across his broad chest. He regarded the wistful, questioning face in silence a moment, then said,- "You believe in constancy, and that there is such a thing as fidelity to plighted vows?" "Yes." "Well then, allow me to present a case," in his logical   216       HONOR BRIGHT. way; " to bring it nearer home, and thus more comprehen- sible, let the two be you and I. Suppose you were my wife." She started, turning as pale as death; he saw it with those keen, penetrating eyes that nothing escaped, but paid no heed, continuing coolly, " and suppose, too, that we loved each other. Now, such being the hypothesis, imagine I should be called away, say to Europe, on bus- iness, and should be delayed months, and even years; would you be true in deed and heart?" ' Yes," coming out on his platform of supposition and answering fearlessly, though her Cheeks were as white as her fleecy dress. He looked at her, his light-blue eyes grown fairly black in their intensity. "And what if I should never return?" "You would still be my husband," in a voice strangely calm.                       . Intuitively, she felt the rapid, sweeping undercurrent in the man's eager presentation of the case. Had he ever had such an experience as he was now depicting? At that firm reply, he unfolded his arms, dnd took her face in one of his hands, searching it intently. The lips were firmly set, the dark eyes looked frankly in his. He took away his hand, with a little convinced smile. "Strength, resistance, truth," he said, as if speaking to himself. The strain on her nervous system had been severe, cruel. She trembled so she scarce could stand, so leant on the iron railing, saying, with a sort of impatient satire, - "I trust you are done with suppositions; they are tire- some. My imagination was never cultivated-; we were held to matter-of-fact incidents and hard study at the Institute."   BO1OR BRIt           21T.  He smiled. lHis next remark was wide off the subject. "Would you like to hear some music?" The color rushed back to her cheeks. "Yes, of all things," eagerly. He looked pleased, and drawing her hand within his arm, led her to the music-room. He drew his stool to the organ.  She went over and stood  in the open casement, parting wide the drapery. She looked a living Beatrice; her white dress sweeping in graceful folds on the polished oaken floor; her slight graceful figure, with its perfect, rounded symmetry. Her bright hair swept from her brow and coiled at the back of her shapely head; and her face, as-she listened to the music, the strong, pure face of Beatrice. The face was slightly averted, the eyes gazing out at the casement; yet the master could watch it plainly as he played. The notes of the organ, now low and sweet, and laden with pathos, now swelling in grandeur and glory, filled the building, stealing out through the many open case- ments, and floating iupon the evening air. The very birds forgot that they had piped their good-night, and drew their pretty heads from under their wings to listen, with mingled ecstasy and awe, at the wondrous majesty and grandeur of this strange singer. Strain   glided into strain, with the exquisitely touching It was like the beating of a great heart. All its aspi- rations, its joys, its sorrows, its pathos, its tears, blended into song; whilst unconsciously, drawn by the strong mag- net, sympathy, the heart of the Jistener wrote its hidden life, in strong, deep tracery on her face. And the master read it. Suddenly the music stopped; but so full was the air of it, and so wrapped the listener, she was not conscious 19   218        HONOR BRiGHT. of the sudden silence, until she felt him beside her. There was & hand upon her shoulder, then an arm about her waist; she was drawn gently, firmly toward him, and gathered to his breast. The proud, immobile face bent low to hers, and, as one in a dream, she heard the words, in that quiet tone of assertion,-- "I love you, and you love me." Esto perpetua I ad infinitumI in cetrenum! they are never realized in this world, but belong essentially to the next. Nothing lasts here! Beauty fades! Youth is fused and lost in age. Our entire being changes--they tell us- every seven years. Life, materially and spiritually, is made up of sunshine and shower. The brightest day has always some cloud in it and is only a day, after all. Twelve short hours and it is night, and be it ever so dark, twelve more will make it morning. Our sorrows and our joys, then, are equally brief in duration. The scales balance. When troubles first come, we imagine life utterly bereft of every pleasure, and- "I wish I was dead!" passes our daring lips. "Time is a great healer!"- a homely truism which, however we may scoff at, we will constantly find to be verified. The greatest trouble, seen through the long vista of the past, becomes dim, and fresh trials blot out the very remembrance. If the sorrow is for the death of a loved one, in nine cases out of ten, the fresh sod of the third suromer has the grief under it. Sometimes far less will suffice, to wit, the many cases where the widower takes the weed from his hat, and places a diamond on another woman's finger, within the same hour. If the sorrow is for a lost hope -   HONOR BRH1T.         219 perhaps harder to bear for a time than a lost friend, since, proverbially, a living trouble is sorer than a dead one - even from it you will rally.

We must believe, we must love. Our natures demand it. We are not to blame. It is not fickleness, but nec- essity. But of this man, and this woman. For an instant there was the wild delirium of joy, the exquisite ecstasy of soul meeting soul. "I love you, and you love me!" Then the rude waking; the old, cruel doubt thrust in between them. The flush died from the girl's cheek; the lustre from her eye. She stole from his arms, and glided from the room; and he stood with folded arms looking after her, a quiet smile, half of amusement, half of wonder, on his proud, cold face. As she passed into the grand main hall, the hump- back glided through an opposite arch. Her way led through the one where "Honor Bright" was gilt in its azure ground.   220        HONOR BRIGHT.

From her casement where the girl stood to cool her flushed brow, she saw him start. A few moments after, the dinner-bell rang. It was a strange meal. The girl remembered it after- wards, as one remembers incidents in dreams. Mrs. Mallory explained the master's abrupt leaving. Clare's spirits rose, as they always did in his brother's absence. Never had he been more brilliant, more witty, or more entertaining. Even little Birdie seemed charmed, regarding the startling beauty of his face in mute wonder. At length, the little creature's persistent gaze attracted the hunmpback's attention. With one of his capricious freaks, he stopped in the midst of his conversation, and regarded her in silence a moment; then, turning to Char- ity, he asked, in a strange tone, - "Who does that imp look like?" Charity turned a shade paler, looking searchingly at the little face with its pitiful expression of sadness, always present when sunniest, but dominant when, as  ,   HONOR BRIGHT.          221 now, earnest and quiet, --that look of grief and trouble which mothers sometimes give their babes. The face told no story. If there was a mystery, if there was a secret, it was guarded well. The girl intui- tively glanced from the child to Mrs. Mallory. She too was regarding the little creature with an expression of intent searching. Could it be that this child was a mys- tery even to her?" The girl was troubled, puzzled, bewildered. After dinner, Charity was going immediately to her own room.* Clare prevented her, entreating her to come and have a game of chess. At first she refused "You never grant even the slightest request; my very presence seems hateful," in bitter reproach. At that she yielded. They played. She lost,-he won. She had played poorly, her thoughts far wide the game. He controlled the board with the subtle planning of the expert, and announced, "checkmated," laughing that ringing, metallic laugh, and saying, in a tone of triumph, - '"For life is a game of chess, where least causeth greatest An ill move loseth, and a pawn'may ensure victory." She pushed her chair back from the table, impatiently. Even a, game of chess may be the figure of a life," he said, significantly.               , The words left an uncomfortable impression. "You know I detest figures, Clare," petulantly. He smiled. She arose. "Where-are you going?" he asked. "Up-stairs," laconically. "You will not play another game?  "No!" in a curt tone. 19*   222       HONOR BRIGHT. C"Not even to retrieve your fortune?" "No!" again. "You are afraid; you know you would lose!" sneer. ingly. "I'm not in the mood;" and, with a cold good-night, she left the room. A moment after, he went to his study. She spent the long hours of the night kneeling in her casement. It was a night of conflict. She arose in the early dawn, with pale, troubled face, the eyes sad and wistful, and with tense lines about the firmly-cut lips. Then changed her white dress for a black one. Was the act symbolical? At breakfast the master had not yet returned. She followed Clare mechanically to his study, then wrote steadily until noon. Clare' ordered lunch served there. She was not hungry; did not even leave the secretary; lie ate heartily, laughing and talking in fine spirits the while. Afterward, the monotonous tone of dictation, and the swift gliding of the pen filled the afternoon. It was full four o'clock; there had been no rest. Tihe face, bending low over the paper, was white; the hand guided the pen unsteadily, wearily. There was a sudden silence. She rested her head on her hand, waiting for him to continue. "You look more natural in black," he said. She had been expecting dictation, so started a little nervously, then half turned toward him, regarding him in listless indifference, as if the subject utterly failed to interest her. "You should always wear mourning; it is more adapted to your spiritual style of beauty," admiringly.   HONOR BRIGHT.          223 She looked annoyed. "There are some people born to trouble. It sits on them with such a grace, it would be k trick toward nature to deprive them of it," he continued, in a strange, incomprehensible tone, that made the girl shudder intui- tively. "Well!" she said, as if waiting for him to complete his thought.  "You are such an one. You may try to cheat fate by putting on white; she is inexorable, and will thrust the black garb on you. You must wear the robe that pleases her." She shuddered. Then, with a very palpable effort, said, ironically, -  "Since when did -your lordship become seer?" "I have the clairvoyant power often bestowed on Spiritualists," he said, paying no heed to her tone. The beauty of his face had become dreamy and unearthly; his dark, lustrous eyes gazed straight before him, as if peering into the dim future. He said, in a low, oracular tone, full of fascination,- "I see your whole life spread out before me as a map." She started to her feet, coming, and standing with cold, haughty face, directly before him. "uClare Mallory, stop this instant! I do not believe in your vaunted power, and will' not be made the dupe of your miserable deceit." The humpback flushed, his eyes flashing angrily. "You do believe it; and fear prompts your insulting taunt." Her face was white and calm. She looked him in the eye with a steady fearlessness. It disconcerted him; he moved restlessly among his cushions. -.   224       HONOR BRIGHT. "' You will believe sometime," he persisted. "Never, while I am in my right, mind," coolly. He paid no attention, but went on; he scarce seemed to hear her, held as he was, spell-bound by the weird fascination of Spiritualism. "You scoff at the idea of spiritual presence, when the body is far absent: yet, fight against it as you may; re- coil from, Ihate me! it will do no good! I am always with you." It sounded like the raving of insanity; she looked at him half frightened, half anxious. He went on dreamily, "When an evil approaches you, I guard you; when you are happy, I feel it, and my heart quickens its pulsa- tions; when sad, it sinks heavy in my breast, and I feel my lip quiver. I seb every expression of your face though walls divide us-" She interrupted him with an exclamation of annoyance. He was silent a moment, then said in an argumentative tone,- "Why do you scoff? That there has been such pow- ers from time immemorial is easily proved, to wit, the prophets and seers of holy writ, the Witch of Endor, the Pythia at the oracle of Delphi, Joan of Arc, Cassan- dra, and the many witches burnt in puritanical New England, and the thousands of others possessed of the power, who have never made it known. Did you ever intuitively turn, and find another regarding you intently?" "That is nothing but will power," sarcastically. "Call it will, mesmerism, or what you may -" She interrupted his dissertation, impatiently. "Clare, you can never make me a convert to your views, and the subject is disagreeable," and she went back to the secretary, collecting the scraps of paper and put- ting them in order.   HONOR BTIGHT.        225 He was watching her from among his cushions; the rare, startling beauty of his face enhanced by the flush of fever; his dark eyes vivid and lustrous with excitement; whilst a strange expression played about his full, volup- tuous lips. "Charity, you haven't any faith in anything, have you?"  Her eyes filled with quick tears. He had-put the question to trouble her, knowing full well she had re- nounced the atheistical views implanted whilst her mind was young and pliant., He qualified the question, "Well then, you haven't faith in anybody?" "You mistake; I have perfect faith in a great many," without turning. "I reckon the many begin with mother, and end with that curious, living mummy, Old Reliable," sarcastically. She turned an indignant face toward him. "Clare, you owe me an apology for speaking so rudely of my oldest, truest friend." He laughed slightingly, saying in a tone of mock pen- itence. "I humbly crave pardon! And from henceforth shall regard her ancient magnificence with the respect and reverence due to such antique worthiness! shall even try to imagine she has a sylph-like form, and translucent complexion." She did not deign any reply. Then there was a brief silence; the humpback broke it., ",You do not trust me, Charity?" "No," frankly. "Why?" "Do you wish me to tell you?" looking at him. "Certainly, .else I'd not ask you," eagerly. t   226       HONOR BRIGQt. You will only be angry or hurt, Clare; so what is the use?" "Tell- me, anyhow," impatiently, and sitting upright among his cushions. "Your whole nature forbids confidence, Clare ;, there is no stability to you; you are all impulse," in a very kind tone. "Pray, continue," he said eagerly, his face flushing. "You want me to read your character as I see it?)" "Yes." "Your capabilities for all that is good and noble are unusual, but you have never fulfilled them. You have wonderful talents and beauty; they should have proved a blessing, but they have not. Your fancy is fickle, and fancy rules your heart; you care most for the things unattainable. -The moment they are yours, you cast them aside with contempt, whether a literary prize, a high station, or a woman's heart; all and each are served alike. Then, too, you are envious, and jealous, and sus- picious--" she stopped suddenly and was silent an in- stant, then went on in a tone of earnest entreaty, "Clare, if only you would fill your high destiny! if only turn your wonderful abilities in the right channel, there is nothing within human power, but that you could achieve.." His face had been Proteus-like in its versatility of expression, eager, pleased, angry, and now as she closed, flushed and beautiful. "And, Charity, if I should fill it would there be any reward?" bending forward, with a wild, eager, amorous expression. "A noble fame; the love and admiration of the good and great; the approval of your own conscience; and   HONOR BRIGHT.         227 best of all, when life is over, the voice of God, bidding you ' Come up higher.'" -Her face was flushed, her dark eye eloquent with the earnestness of her appeal. For a moment he seemed to catch her spirit, and was silent; then, with a light, mocking laugh, he broke rudely from the holy influence that was gathering about him.. "Ask a man thirty-three to begin life afresh," he said, with bitter contempt. "Why, Clare, thirty-three is young," argumentatively. "Young!" with cutting sarcasm. "Perhaps it is; somne are green boys at that age; but I have crowded more into my thirty-three than most men into their three score," with a laugh that made the girl shudder. Then he went on in a half vain, half bitter tone, "I've been a gay boy; I've drained the cup of pleasure to its dregs, and God knows they are bitter enough. I would have to be literally bor again, and that without this cursed hump, to fill the destiny your soaring imagination has pictured. Even then, could I realize it in its most glow- ing hues, it would fail to satisfy me," in a tone of despair- ing contempt. She looked at him sadly, and went on arranging the papers. "You see, Charity, there is no use; we are as we are made; the fault lies not in us, but in the making. I would rather have the undivided love of a beautiful woman than all the ambitious rewards you have so elo- quently dilated on," with a strange smile about the full voluptuous lips. The girl did not answer, but he saw her face; it was enough, it was full of contempt. His eyes flashed angrily. "Pity! contempt! disgust!" he muttered, fiercely. She looked weary; the strain on her nerves had been   228       HONOR BRIGHT. severe all day. The self-reliant, stoical nature had sunk beneath its constant conflict, He went on, with the wild vehemence of desperation,- "You spurn me. There are others you might spurn as well. Do you forget that I told you there was one carried a hump upon his soul?" That fearful innuendo again. The girl reeled where she stood. "Our exalted saint, our youthful Croesus, our paragon of all excellence, Mark Mallory, has told you that he loves you, and he is a married man I " She did not faint; she did not even reel; she was stunned, stupified with the blow.

JAMES MOSTGOMn ER READER, were you ever in the night rudely awakened from a vivid, beautiful dream, by the clang of bells and the wild cry of fire, and starting up from the glowing, radiant scenes in which you had been present, find only darkness and terrors? Did you ever watch a vessel, with all its human souls and wealth of freight, strike a reef, and sink helplessly within very sight of land? Did you ever hasten home from afar, hurrying to the embrace of a loved one--like Bernardo Del Carpio-- and find, instead of the  joyous, living presence, cold, white, mocking death? Did you ever pour the chrism of your life before an image set up in the innermost recess of your heart, and suddenly find  the idol hurled from its pedestal broken and shattered? .  Did you ever wonder why God made the world? or how he could be both merciful and just?    This girl left the study with the noiseless, vague, wandering step of a somnambulist.  Her face was pitiful to see-hard, stony, and white as a thing of marble. She did not seek 20   230      I HONOR BRIGHT. her own room, but went to that unique library, with its many memories. There was a chair standing by a table; she staggered to it, and sinking in it crossed her arms wearily on the table, and buried her face in them. An hour went by. Oh! the fearful capacity of one short hour, either for joy or sorrow, for good or evil! The many little lives brought into this great, troub- lous world; the many souls plunged into eternity, ush- ered into the presence of their God; the many hearts united "for better or worse till death us do part; " the many hearts torn rudely asunder; the- happy greetings; the sad good-byes; the good deeds that are to be "jewels in our crowns;'! the crimes that blacken and blot our souls; the one deed that ruins us for this world, perhaps for the next! 'Sixty tiny minutes, filled, swelled, bursting with an- guish Oh! the hours that with their burdens have gone into the past, silently waiting until the great Judge shall bid them bring forth their records. Once there were three, " from the sixth to the ninth hour," when "darkness was over all the land," when the dear Christ bowed his head, and cried in accents of anguish, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?" What hours were they! A God's capacity for suffering met and filled! Since then, nearly two thousand years ago, there has not an hour gone by that has not borne with it that despairing cry, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" That well-known hand upon her shoulder; that hand whose touch thrilled her being, quickening even the, crushed heart to vibrations of hope and trust- -for there was something in this man demanded confidence.  The face was raised, with the agony of that fearful hour traced in its every lineament. The pale, ghastly   HONOV BIBGT.          231 cheeks; the dark, heavy rings under the eyes; the firm lips, with their grieved, tense lines. "Charity, my darling, you are ill!" he said, in a tone of alarm, and taking the face in his hands the better to see it. She shook her head in denial. "What;is it then, dear heart?"Mfark Mallory's cold quiet voice, thrilling and musical with love. She buried her face in her hands. You should have seen the man as he bent over her.  This cold, proud man; this man of wonderful genius, of extended influ- ence; this man who rather read others' thoughts, and feelings, and passions, than revealed his own; now, the firm, immobile face was all alight; aye, even flooded.; the blue eyes dark, vivid, eloquent, whilst he poured before her his oblation of love--the love of a  deep, strong nature--and asked her to be his wife. Not until then did she glance up and see him. They were cruel words of reproach and accusation she uttered. "Mr, Mallory, you have insulted me. Perhaps you think it little difference, since I am alone, and poor. You were a  married man." The change that came over the man!   His face grew cold and stern;  his lips white and compressed. He stood erect, with folded arms, regarding her in silence. She trembled at that freezing, withering look. "Clare told you this?" he said, in his wonted tone of quiet questioning. She could not speak, but bowed her head. "Did he tell you anything else?" he continued, in that same tone that demanded all, gave none. "Nothing!" The reply was little more than a  gasp.. Until that   232       HONOR BRIGHT. moment, there had been a latent, unacknowledged hope, whose existence was only realized through its death, that he would prove it false. He did not refute the charge, but rather confirmed it. For an instant there was that terrible silence that makes a moment seem a life-time.' She had buried her face from his sight. He spoke her name, "Charity " She dare not disobey the latent command in that little word, so looked up into his face. "You have aspersed my 'Honor Bright.' The day will come when you will prove that you trust me, and plead for the very love you now so wantonly cast aside." Then he left her, with his firm step, and cold, proud bearing. She arose and went to her room, with feeble, tottering step, groping her way in a blind sort of fashion, as if it was dark, though the sun was but setting. When there, she sank in a chair, in a mute, dumb way. Thus Reli- able found her, a little later, when the twilight had gathered into a settled gloom. She had met Mr. Mallory in the hall. "What have you done to the master?" she demanded, in her blunt way. "What have I done to the master, Reliable?" re- peated the girl after her, in a passive, bewildered tone. The woman started, the hard lines in her face soften- ing. She adjusted her double glasses, and looked at the girl keenly in the dim light. "Charity, what is it, child?" There was no answer. "What has the master been saying to you?"  "Reliable, he insulted me; he asked me to be his wife " in a still unnatural voice.   HONOR BRIGHT.          33 233 The woman thought it a wild speech of delirium. Her seamed, wrinkled face worked in anxiety. "Do my ears deceive me, child? An. insult for the master to ask you, a poor girl making her living, to be his wife?" she demanded, with a sort of sharp irony. "Reliable, he is a married man." It was little more than a whisper; excess of anguish made it sound cold, to indifference. The woman's angular figure grew erect and stern. "Who told you so?".angrily, as if the slur had been cast on her own character instead of her master's. "Clare." "The other one/ I thought as much. It is a lie/" fiercely. The white face, with its heavy eyes, its grieved, tense lines, looked pitifully up into hers. "Reliable, he did not deny itl " At that the woman stood like one stunned, the parch- ment-like face drawn into countless wrinkles, the scroll- like lips turned down at either corner. "What did he say, child?" "That I had aspersed his 'Honor Bright.'" "Nothing else." Her lips quivered. Reliable did not persist, but glanced away, with a true delicacy that the uninitiated would not have looked for in this strange, sharp, brusque woman.    : The next question was put in a low, gentle tone. "You love him, child?" A  little dry sob was the only reply. The woman stepped a little aside, in her blunt, abrupt fashion. "You are not well; your head aches. Ith bring you your dinner," she said, and left her, pausing outside the 20*   234:       HONOR BRIHT. door to wipe a sudden mist from her double glasses, then muttering, as she passed down the stairs,-  "What a fool I've been! I thought it was the other one she loved!" and adding, in dazed perplexity, "A married man!" She was gone but a few minutes. When she returned, she found the girl where she had left her, with her mute, white face. Reliable drew a light stand beside her, and placed the tray upon it. Not a mouthful had passed her lips since breakfast; she was weak, faint. "Try and eat, child," with an effort to speak cheerily. She shook her head, sadly. There was a glass of wine upon the tray. Reliable held it to .the white lips with that quiet will to which the suffering yield implicity, nor would take it away until the contents were quaffed. "Now you will be better, directly. Eat a bit of chicken, dear," coaxingly. She shook her head. The woman fed her a few mouthfuls, with gentle determination. The very effort produced the reaction required. The white face was buried in the nervous hands; the girl was crying. "There, child 1 it's just the best thing for you to cry. It's the natural way; we come into the world so," com- fortingly. Then, in a more hopeful tone, "Keep up a good heart; there's Old Reliable left. To be sure, it's only Old Reliable; but she's staunch and true; and there's one better than any earthly friend, - Jesus, the dear Christ," the brusque tone softening with love and worship. Then adding, "Mrs. Mallory wanted to come and see you. She loves you like one of her own. I told her you had best go to bed. Now, you are tired,   HBONOR BRIGHZ.         235 child; let me help you. I put you to bed many a night when you were a baby." And she loosened the bright hair, and brought her night-dress, the girl perfectly passive in her hands; then, afterwards, kissed her, and stole quietly from the room, knowing her nature, and that she must bear this thing, and conquer, alone. When she had gone, Charity threw a wrapper over her snowy robe, and, going over, knelt in the open case- ment. The twilight had deepened; it was night, and the stars were out. She laid her head wearily on the sill, the nervous hands clasped in dumb; mute appeal. Who so daring as to tear the veil from   a human heart? What eye so wanton, so impious, as to scan its hidden life?--to view it crushed and bleeding; to listen to its sluggish pulsations; it's pitiful, slow throbs and beats?  Hope hanging her head! Faith, with her eyes covered! Love, wounded, yet in its terrible anguish, clinging to life! It was such" silent, stony, tearless anguish as would have made her guardian angel weep, if angels ever do. First, the terrible prostration of grief, - the white face passive in its utter helplessness; then, the old self-reliance coming in, and striving to take up the burden, but sinking beneath it; then, the wild groping about for help, --the dry, hollow eyes peering despairingly out into the darkness. Suddenly, in the terrible gloom, making it bright as noonday, with the halo emanating from deity, arose before her, that picture of her dying Lord. He  had suffered even unto death for her, in his anguish, in'the garden of Gethsemane, had sweat great drops of blood for her. Now those dear eyes looked pityingly down upon her; those loving arms were extended for her; she fell at the foot   236       ' HOfOR BRIGHT. of the cross, and cried to Fim who hath promised to wipe all tears from off all faces." An hour later, the moonlight stealing in through the wide-parted drapery, gathered in loving wonder about the bed. Her bright, beautiful hair swept her shoulders; one arm was thrown in graceful abandonment above her head, the other hand supported her cheek. The face was pale and wan, but the tense lines about the lips had re- laxed, and though grieved, there was that expression of peace and childlike faith one often sees on the lips of sleeping babes, which seems the perfect, beautiful imprint of a mother's kiss. The lids were drooping, the long, silken lashes lay moist upon her cheeks. "For so he giveth-his beloved sleep." Old Reliable came in to the bedside, and stood long regarding the sad, faireface, with the moonlight all about it, her own strongly marked countenance working with varying emotions; then stole from the room, with these words ringing in her ears, "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee." Before she slept that night, the woman brought the light full to bear on the little face pillowed in the dainty wee crib "She does not look like him," she muttered; "no; nor like any one else that ever I saw; without -- she started, adjusting the double' glasses, and scanning the face more keenly. The mother's grief on the baby's face dominant in sleep; the perfect tiny features; the brown curly hair; but it was the lips, and the expression about them, at which the double glasses were levelled. There was a certain weak yielding- to them,-- without --without it's Nelson," with a sudden start.   '    SIONOR BRIGB  T.       237 CHAPTER XXT.

It would be like doing without a Sabbath, only inconceivably worse; and France, in 1793, made known to all the world the result of such an exper- iment. Charity slept the dreamless sleep of exhaustion. And so the night passed, and the stars paled in the morning twilight. The early dawn found the girl where we have seen her before, in the picture gallery, with worshipful eyes raised to that representation of the crucified Saviour.   238       BHONOR BRIGHT. The master had gone away. "His foreman being taken suddenly, and dangerously ill, he was obliged to seek another, and had gone to C   , the nearest city, for that purpose," so his mother explained at breakfast. That morning was spent in writing. Clare's mind had never seemed more prolific. 'The girl wrote mechan- ically, with white, still face, and that cold dignity peculiar to her about her like a garment. The hump- back did not address a word of conversation to her. There was an expression of despair and desperation on his beautiful face. He had never written with greater power or fascination. It was a romance, the love of a spirit for a spirit, and the wondrous influence one ex- erted over the other. A wierd, dreamy story of the great passion. The language was the choicest and most delicately forcible, the figures and metaphors the most beautiful; whilst throughout all pervaded a seductive fascination, a demoralizing tendency so subtle as to render it utterly impossible to fasten on, or cavil at any one point advanced; whilst crime was so glossed over by beauty of imagery, and sustained by such perfect soph- istry, as to look almost like virtue. The amanuensis was barely conscious -that she was writing. They were only so many words to her; char- acters whose symbol she failed to see; a sort of minia- ture pantalogy; and the humpback saw it. His beautiful face flushed, his eyes flashed with a fierce, deep brilliancy. He stopped abruptly. "You are free from your irksome task," he said. She arranged the papers in perfect order, not neglect- ing the most minute point of duty, then arose and left the room. Mrs. Mallory met her at the door, saying she had or- dered the carriage, and adding,-    BONOR BRIGHT.          239 "You are, pale, love. Your head must have ached sadly, last night. A ride will do you good." Her gentle face was anxious and perplexed, as if some- thing puzzled her. Clare declined joining their party. They rode until dinner. , - That day was a fair sample of every other for a week. Only one peculiarity marked it-Selden spent every evening of the seven with them. In that week, this girl. whose story we are telling, lived more than in all her life together. It was a week of such conflict as only strong natures can endure, since only such are capable of it. For, we either have suffer- uing or joy given us, only in proportion to our capacity. In this week the face grew more and more like the face of Beatrice, pure, earnest, strong., Never after that first night was this grief, that had come into her life, men- tioned. Old Reliable, understanding her characteristic self-reliance, and with true womanly delicacy recognizing this to be a trouble beyond sympathy, offered none, save such as the  eye expressed, and little acts of kindness made felt. But the woman's double glasses were never off her odd, turned-up nose in all that week; and Clare Mallory often grew restless at the small, keen, gray eyes levelled at him through those double lenses. So the week was gone, and in its going, had left a 'look of strong resolve, of firm, fixed purpose on Charity's white, calm face, for the face was wondrously, piteously calm. SLe must leave this place, this home of her childhood; she was only waiting for the master to return. Still he came not, and seven more days went by--two weeks! - His mother grew anxious, nervous; they had had no word; she feared he was sick. Clare scoffed at the very idea. Mark, the invulner- J   240        ONOR BRIGHT. able Mark, with his iron frame, sick! He laughed his mother's fears to scorn. In those days the dictator and amanuensis had scarce exchanged a word. Now it was an' afternoon; Clare, being in the mood, had written longer than usual, thus cutting off their ride. The girl was bending low over her work, when suddenly there was a lull in the low, mo- notonous tone. She glanced up to see the cause; the humpback stood beside her. His dark eyes were moist and dim, his soft, full lips quivering. "Charity, what have I done to make you so angry?" he asked, in a tone broken and reproachful. She looked at him in cool, indifferent surprise. "Angry, Clare? I've not been angry." "No, not angry; you are too cold, too utterly devoid of impulse, to know the meaning of any passion. You are like a beautiful block of marble, without the breath of life," in passionate reproach; then adding, "Oh, if only I had the power to inspire you with it." She looked annoyed, and began putting aside the papers, not looking at him. He went on excitedly,-- "Do you know you have hardly spoken to me for days? They seem years! Do you intend always to sustain this terrible silence? Are you never going to speak to me again?" She looked at him in surprise. So troubled had she been she was scarce conscious of the cause of this ebulli- tion. "I suppose you have never thought of me once in all this time! You have sat here like a living automaton, nothing better -" She interrupted him haughtily,- "Clare, why this tirade of reproach? I have had   HONOR BRIGHT.         241 nothing to say. Probably if I had I should have said "I detest precisians, who work out their lives by a given rule, never deviating; who make nothing but weighty remarks, never indulging in a frivolous speech. I suppose my conversation must bore you to death." She had put aside the papers, and was regarding him indifferently, with her head resting on her hand. "Clare, are you through writing?" she asked. He gnawed his full, voluptuous lips in silence. "It is very warm. I am tired. If you do not wish to write any more, I will try for some air on the veran- da," she continued. He paid no heed, but seizing her hand, passionately said,-  "Charity, why do you treat me with this chilling re- serve? You are kinder to the very servants. Even Selden has his share of your favor." She drew away her hand haughtily. "Mr. Selden and I are very good friends," she said. "And you and I?" eagerly. "Well, what are we, Clare? You are such a stormy individual, I doubt if you could even comprehend that calm, firm, true word, friend," lightly, and with a little, kind smile. She sincerely pitied him, with his unhappy moods, his morbid, jealous, suspicious disposition. His face lighted up. "That is the first kind word I have had from your lips for weeks. It isweeeeter than the tones Orpheus drew forth from his magic lyre," he said, in a grateful, amorous tone, then added, "You told the truth. We are notfrie/nds. I would rather, by far, be your enemy." Intuitively she shuddered. He continued,-- 21   242   -    HONOR BRIGHT. "I never had a friend in my life, Charity. I tried once. We called it friendship, but afterward found it love," with a ringing, mocking laugh. There was a contemptuous curve all about the girl's lips. He saw it, but gave it no heed, only changing the subject, asked, - "How do you like the romance we are writing?" She was wholly unconscious even of its plot and bear- ing, so mechanical had been her work, but was too kind to hurt him by acknowledging the fact, so said, eva- sively,-   t   ' "I can tell you better when it is finished, Clare." He had expected her to denounce it, and nottdetecting the bit of strategy in the reply, said, exultingly, - {(I shall make a convert of you through it yet. I believe my talent was not given me for nothing, after all." At that moment, there was the patter of little feet, and Birdie, with the daring of childhood, crossed the threshold of Clare's sanctum; a thing not another in the household, saving its lord, would have dared to do without permission. She came up to Charity's side. "Pretty, Yiable says baby's coss, cause her wants you, her do," roguishy. She lifted the little creature on her lap. Clare scowled. "Hang it! It's either the old woman or the young one, all the time," he muttered. Charity was petting Birdie. She looked like a cherub in her dainty white robe; her wee self just fresh from the bath, her curls still moist and glossy. Instinctively the child felt the humpback's displeasure. ' It's horrid in here; baby don't yike it, her don't; come yight away!" imperatively. Charity laughed, and arose, taking her in her arms.   rOJrOR BRTrT.          43 "You are going?" asked Clare, angrily. She nodded, "Yes," indifferently, and left the room. "Now, wee tyrant, which way?" she asked, when they were out in the broad, grand hall. Birdie pointed with her chubby hands to the main entrance. The girl obeyed, rolling back the massive door. At the foot of the low, broad steps, stood a carriage; whilst just step- ping into the vestibule was the master. "O Mark! Mark!" cried Birdie, throwing herself forward, with the fearlessness characteristic of child- hood. Charity had turned as pale as death, and grown so faint she would have-dropped'her, had not the master sprung forward and caught the little creature in his arms. Then she threw both tiny arms about his neck, kissing him with loving impetuosity. The girl stood, apparently innoticed, vainly striving for self-control. "Such yots of kisses, cried Birdie, in a satisfied tone. Then, with childlike innocence, "l Mark, kiss Pretty, too.  Thus bringing this man and this woman face to face! She, with those traces of suffering and set lips, striving for self-control; he, cold, proud, almost severe. And so their eyes met.   Ah, those light, blue eyes, quite im- passive; ters, heavy and drooping. Then followed one of those unaccountable speeches little children often startle us with. "Mark, Pretty is werry sorry, her is.    Kiss her, Mark, yat's a  good Mark." He never took his eyes from  the girl's white, wan face, but said, with that proud, distant air,-- "That is for her to say, Birdie." This having failed, the tiny tyrant, bound on having her own way, and thinking Charity greatly abused in having no kiss from Mark, changed her tactics.   244'        HONOR BRIGHT. "You kiss Mark, then, Pretty, yat's the way!" ex- ultingly, as if having hit on the right plan at last. It was more than could be borne. The girl turned pale and went out on to the steps, while the master passed into the house, carrying the child with him; a bitter smile curving his lips at the recollection of the only words of welcome uttered at his first crossing that threshold months ago,- "Who enters here leaves hope behind."

GEORGIE CRABB. As hour later the dinner-bell rang. Charity was late, having delayed her toilet. When she entered the dining- room, the family were seated, with the addition of Messrs. Hammond   and Selden.  The two gentlemen having called, in driving by, the master had insisted on their remaining. The young girl found their presence an infinite relief. Altogether it was a merry meal. Mr. Mallory, the courteous, affable host; his mother, relieved frqm her anxiety on his account, full of gentle gayety; and Clare entertaining, whilst Mr. Hammond filled in any chance pause with his endless volubility. The girl had no need to talk. She thought her silence wholly unnoticed, until once glancing up, she met Selden's eyes, with an anxious,   HONOR BRIGHT.         245 troubled expression in them. When the wine was served, and the ladibs arose, he took Birdie in his arms to ac- company them. "Keep your seat, Selden; the nurse will look after that young one," Clare rather commanded than invited. "I do not wish any wine," was the reply, with a tone of latent defiance in the voice. They went to the drawing-room; Selden was playing with Birdie, Mrs. Mallory busy with her fancy-work, whilst Charity had gone. out on the veranda. Shortly the gentlemen joined them. Clare glanced hastily around, then, ere they were seated, proposed a game of billiards. The master excused himself, saying they expected to cast, at the furnace that night, and his foreman being a new hand, he would be obliged to be present. "But you'll not go at once," objected Clare, captiously. "I believe I did not say so," was the sententious reply, and regarding his brother coolly. "Why not have a game then?" in a pleasanter tone. "I have other plans," laconically; then excusing him- self courteously to his guests, he left them; they going to the billiard-room, he to his library. Mrs. Mallory was talking to Birdie, whilst the girl on the veranda, all unnoticed, sat with her head bowed in her hands; the expression of fixed purpose that her face had worn in those wearisome days that had passed, all gone, and in its place, indecision, doubt, almost fear. Was her life to be one of endless conflict and struggle? Should she be constantly called upon to make weighty decisions? brought face to face with difficulties that could not be gone around, set aside, or reasoned with, but which must be met and overcome. Had all women such lives? It would .look like ingratitude; doubtless he would be angry; but it must be done. The lips were 21   246        HONOR BRIGHT. firmly set, the face pale, though quiet and composed, and wearing its old habitual expression of stoicism and firm bracing against trouble. She arose and went into the house. "Where are you going, love?" asked Mrs. Mallory. "I will be back presently," was the evasive reply. Where was she going? To the master. She seemed instinctively drawn into his presence; she did not have to seek him, but walked directly to the room where he was, his library. He was seated by the table, in that boyish position peculiar to him, his face buried in his hands. The light was turned very dim; so that the furniture and pictures, and rare bits of statuary were only just discernible, what little light streamed from the curiously wrought and tinted shade, falling on the master's bowed head. She entered the room; he did not seem to hear her, or, if he did, gave no sign; so she went over and stood at the table beside him; still he appeared unconscious of her presence. She bit her lips, struggling for control, then spoke his name in a low, frightened tone, - "Mr. Mallory." He uncovered his face, and turning on the light, full blaze, looked at her. Nothing ever surprised this man into the betrayal of an emotion. Perhaps he had known she was present, perhaps not; the sudden mention of his name gave him no start; he was as usual, cool and self- possessed. His nerves seemed iron, like his will. His coolness perturbed her's; she stood before him in the bright blaze of light, pale and mute. He would not help her even with that questioning "Well?" of his, but waited, watching her with an indifferent, nonchalant air. The silence was unendurable; she bit her lips nervously, then said in a stumbling, hesitating way,-   -HONOR BRIGHT.        247 "I want to speak to you, Mr. Mallory." "I am listening," laconically, with that amusement rather felt than discerned. She went on desperately, - "I want to speak to you about going away from here." His, immobile face did not reveal his slightest thought. She continued in a broken voice, her white face pitiful in its effort for control. "Mr. Mallory, you must not think me ungrateful! I can never, never forget all you have done for me; but I cannot stay here now." "- And why?" was the reply in a tone of cool, quiet questioning. It stung her. He thought she could not live under the same roof with him,-without suffering, whilst he was so utterly impassive. The lips grew firm, the head was proudly raised. He saw her interpretation with an odd bit of a smile, and repeated the question, - "And why?" "Because I wish to leave," haughtily. "You have not found this a good home,? You have not been well treated?" in a tone half reasoning, half questioning. "You know better, Mr. Mallory.  I think you un- kind!" with grieved impetuosity. "Clare is selfish and exacting; he expects too much?" She interrupted him, earnestly, - "My work is nothing!" "Well, then, my mother is not gentle to you; you dis- I like her." Her eyes filled with tears, there was-a tone of almost angry disclaim in her reply, - "If I had a mother of my own, you know very well I could not love her more."  I   248       HBONOR BRIGHT. "Your objection, then? It is neither mother nor Clare. According to very logical reasoning, there being only three of us, and two being declared innocent, the lot must fall to the third,--your most unfortunate and humble servant," with that air of amusement. The blood surged up her pale face to her very brow; and the master never took his eyes from her. It was unkind, cruel; he seemed to find an irresistible fascina- tion in tormenting this girl, in proving her strength, in drawing forth the different phases of her variable charac- ter; it gave him pleasure, and his selfishness bade him gratify it. A moment she struggled for control, then her old stoicism came to her aid, and she met the light-blue eyes frankly, fearlessly, and said,-- "You are right." A more timid woman would have either disclaimed or evaded this plain, disagreeable, unflattering truth, which he had advanced; but she met and acknowledged it with quiet dignity. He was not angry, but rather pleased, at her independence and her daring. She, a poor, unpro- tected girl, dare tell him, the lord of almost fabulous wealth, that he was an objection  He smiled oddly, then said, in a cool, business-like tone,-- "I engaged you for two years?" She nodded assent. "Our agreement made no allowance in case of contin- gencies?" "None," starting a little. He smiled at the unsophisticated nature, that frankly made admissions, which placed her completely within his argumentative power; then went on, indisputably. ' Well then, unless you have excellent reasons to offer, not even law, let alone business honor, would permit you to leave without my consent."   HONOR BRIGHT.         249 She bit her lip in annoyance. He continued'in' a stern, distant manner,-- "You have but one objection; you shall be relieved of that. I go to Europe again, in the fall; until then, let me assure you, Mark Mallory is too proud a man to trouble any woman." The hauteur of his tone was inimitable. There was silence for an instant, then he added in that conclusive way, characteristic of his logical mind,  "Iaw and honor, without just provocation, which you have not, forbid the annulling of a business agreement, without the consent of the other party interested. I refuse to give that consent," regarding her with cold determination. She chafed beneath his iron will, her cheeks flushed, she set her lips, then said, excitedly,- "' You are a tyrant, Mr. Mallory I " "You have accused me of worse things," was the stern, haughty reply. "It was the first direct reference he had made to their last meeting.  Until then, he had utterly ignored it. At the mention, the girl grew pale, reeling where she stood; she was standing directly before him, so close that lie could have stretched out his hand to support her, but his arms  were folded across his chest, he was leaning back lazily in his chair. He had not touched her even to shake hands with her since his return. Now he saw her faint and trembling, struggling for control, but gave her no aid;   only quietly, almost heartlessly, watching her conquer alone. She clutched the table nervously with one hand to steady her reeling senses, with the other covered her eyes to shut out their blindness. A weaker woman would have yielded and fainted; not so this girl; she bit her white lips, struggling fiercely, and at length, *1           6   250        HONOR tRIqHT. the heart renewed its beating, the dark eyes grew steady and clear; she would not even lean upon the table for support, but folded her arms, looking at him in firm self- dependence, though white as death. The act was signifi- cant. The man's immobile face utterly hid the admira- tion he felt. He said coolly,- "There is nothing clinging in your nature; you can live alone." "If necessary, yes." His tone had been galling. She continued with a sort of impetuous irony, (' My heart education was, from childhood, neglected, you know; consequently, I never crave sympathy or aid. The first incident in my life was a sorrow; every inicident that has marked it since has been of its kind. People become hardened." He smiled, then said with inimitable scorn,- "I detest weak natures.") This side play was disagreeable to her; she asked in a tone of annoyance,- "What has all this to do with my going away?" "Perhaps more than you would think, at first thought. Pray consider the matter in a clear, reasonable light ; since I dislike coercion. My mother would miss you sadly; Clare would be helpless. Your absence would cause a great gap in their lives. By going, you prove yourself selfish and weak; by remaining, self-denying and strong." The argument was trenchant, convincing. She was silent, in perplexed, troubled thought. "Well?" he said, questioningly, I will stay." "Honor bright?" with a smile flitting across his proud face. t.

The author did his work, the amanuensis hers. Each life in this grand, oriental castle, seemed to fulfill its object. Were they all, aye, was there any one of them complete. Only the master's life seemed to have dropped out of theirs. He was never at home; he fairly lived at the furnace, assign- ing for reason his projedted European trip in the Fall, and the necessity of having his men well trained before he left. He had had a room furnished for him, and for convenience, took his meals at the nearest hotel. Mrs. Mallory had at first rebelled, but he convinced her of the necessity, and she yielded to the determination, which, when exercised toward her, was winning rather than wilful. But for all she yielded, her gentle face'was troubled, and she was continually dwelling on his antici- pated trip, looking forward to it with dread, and wonder- ing why, when they were all so happy, he could not be contented at home, too,.   252      H. ONOR BRIGHT. So July passed, and August spread its sun-kissed fruits in the lap of summer. The weather was warm to oppressiveness; the excessive heat proved depressing to their spirits. Even little Birdie seemed to feel the sad- dening, enervating influence. The great heart of nature seemed to beat slow; and man's heart acknowledged sympathy with its sluggish pulsations. Old Reliable alone bore up bravely. She had never been more energetic or active. The double glasses were constantly in requisition. The woman was studying a difficult lesson, solving a perplexing problem, - human nature. The keen gray eyes needed all the aid those double lenses could afford. One evening, when the long month was about half over, Mrs. Mallory, Clare, and Charity were out on the ve- randa which overhung the ravine. A yellow August moon lighted up earth and sky, making it almost as bright as day. Mrs. Mallory and Charity were sitting on the rustic settee. Clare had wheeled an ottoman to his mother's feet, and laid his head in her lap, whilst her white hand tenderly toyed with his long, beautiful 1liir. Mrs. Mallory had been telling of her childhood and girl- hood, spent among the mountains of Vermont. They had been listening like two children, pleased with a, story. "Mother," tell us the romance of your life," said Clare. She sighed, saying, evasively, - "You know your father died soon after -you were born, Clare." "'Why do you never talk of my father?" he per- sisted. There was a faint flush on the widow's cheek; you   H-ONOR BRIGHT.        253 could see it in the moonlight. Charity's eyes flashed indignantly at the next question.  "Were you not happy together?" It received no answer. Instantly it was followed by another. "Which is most like him, mother, Mark or I?" "You both resemble him. Mark in his strong, in- domitable will, you " -- She paused abruptly, looking beyond him  with a vague, troubled expression, as if he had awakened un- happy recollections. He finished for her. "And I have his suspicious, jealous disposition." As he spoke, he looked, not at his mother, but up into Charity's face., It was shocked and indignant at his cruelty. "You should not blame me for my mood, since it comes direct from my dead father," he said. She made no answer; so he went on,- "Marriage is the root of all evil. If my mother had never married, she would never have been tormented, as she doubtless was, nor my father unhappy, as Iknow he was. Then, neither Mark nor I would ever have been, and you, to-night, would not be looking as white as a wraith." She bit her lips in silent annoyance. He laid his white, delicate hand tenderly on hers. "Charity, what makes you so very pale and troubled? You think you hide it, but you do not." She shook off the hand impetuously, but he did not take it from her lap, appealing to his mother. "( Mother, can you see any earthly reason why I should not hold Charity's hand in mine?" The gentle, wistful look came from the past into the present. She smiled half fondly, half sadly. 22   254       EOXOB BRIG BT. ti She is the one to give the reason, not , dear." "What is your reason, Charity?" his hand still on her lap, quite beside those white, nervous hands, now clasped in firm decision, but not daring again to touch them. "I wish you were brother and sister," Mrs. Mallory said, gently. "Brother and sister!" with -a ringing, contemptuous laugh. "I would not be her brother for all the world." His mother looked distressed, glancing with a loving, deprecating expression at the young girl. "Why not, Clare?  Surely there could not be a sweeter sister. I love her as if she was my own child." Gentle, unsuspicious Mrs. Mallory! The humpback laughed long and loud. "Charity, you tell mother why I would not have you for a sister." She looked annoyed beyond measure. "Clare, will you be good enough to move your hanid?" He dared not disobey the quiet dignity in her tone. His beautiful face was angry and clouded; he averted it so his mother should not catch its expression. At that moment a hand pushed aside the drapery of the French window, and Selden stepped out on the veranda. The humpback scowled, not even so much as bidding him good evening, whilst Charity arose, greeting him in the kind, almost sisterly manner she had lately adopted toward him, bringing a light chair from the drawing- room for him. Then there was an easy flow of desultory talk. The girl did not resume her seat, but stood lean- ing against the railing. A little after, Clare joined her, standing close beside her, and talking in an unnecessarily low tone. Mrs. Mallory was thus left to entertain Sel-   HONOR BRItT.          255 den.  He seemed restless and uneasy, watching the two with anxious, troubled eyes. At length Mrs. Mallory excused herself, and Charity went into the house with her,' thus leaving the gentlemen alone. Not five min- utes later, Selden left the house with a fierce, desperate expression about the usually weak lips, and with the humpback's mocking laugh rinoing in his ears. Presentiments, premonitions; the shadows that coming events cast and such, are scoffed at as the creation of diseased and morbid minds. Yet, even since Christ's time, aye and before, men have been warned of God by dreams and visions. We have neither a mental hallucination to portray, nor yet the phantasmagoria of a dream to describe, but simply to tell of a presentiment. Charity went to her room that night, burdened with such.  To be sure, it might be accounted for by natural causes. She was spent, overwrought. The tension on her nervous system had been cruel, racking; her wan, white face bore full testimony to what she had suffered in striving to be strong. Now, a sudden dread, almost a terror, had seized her. She could not overcome it. The fear was indescribable, unaccountable, intangible. She knew not what she .feared-; but the very silence of her apartments oppressed, even terrified her. Something, she felt certain, was going to happen. What produced this restless, terrified state, which so completely over. came and mastered her?   She had not the power even to reason against this seeming folly. Once the thought presented itself, - "Could it be -Clare's vaunted power?" She shuddered. Whatever it was, she could not endure it alone another moment. She opened the door and stepped out into the hall. It was still flooded with the tinted light from the pendant lamp. She passed through   256       BHOXOR BBIrGT. it to another hall, leading to Old Reliable's room. The door was slightly ajar: she entered.  The woman's angular form was bending over the dainty little crib, with that searching expression on her seamed, wrinkled face. She did/ not hear the girl, so intent was she, until she stood beside her and spoke her name, then started nervously. "Child, what a fright you gave me! I'm  powerful fidgety to-night, any way." ' "You nervous, Reliable!" in a .tone half of raillery, half of surprise. "Well, I don't know as you'd just call it nervous, child; I've no notion of the hysterics, or any such capers, but I feel all flustered, somehow; you know the old saying,- *By the pricking of my thumbs, Something evil this way comes.' Well, my thumbs don't just exactly prick, but I feel as though, if they were doing their duty, they would,"-- the woman's characteristic way of describing the very feeling the girl had just experienced. The coincidence smote her with fresh terror. "Why, Reliable, do you think something is going to happen?" "That's just it, exactly, child; you hit the nail plump on its head. I'm just sure of it; and I've bothered and puzzled to find out the ' something,' until my head is as completely turned as ever was milk in a thunder storm. Now, I just mean to give up, and wait the Lord's time," and she sat down on the edge of the bed nearest the crib, and folded her gaunt arms across her chest. The young girl was watching her, with her white, troubled face. "You see, child, it worries me to see you so pale; and   HONOR BRIGIT.         25 I honestly believe it is all for a lie. I've been trying to prove it such, but can't, though I believe it all the same." The girl grasped the crib nervously; the woman went on in a perplexed tone, - "You see that baby troubles me. Not even the mis- tress seems to know who it belongs to.' It don't look like any but one person; and that one only once in a great while, and powerful uncertain at that." "Who, Reliable?" she gasped. "Selden," bluntly; The girl started, searching the little sleeper's face, but failing to see any resemblance. "I don't think his failing would tend in that direction, either," added the woman in perplexity. "Reliable, is Birdie well?" the girl interrupted in an anxious tone. "Yes, child, why?" "She is so white about her mouth." The woman bent over the crib again, searching the baby face through her double glasses., "She has felt the heat a great deal to-day; I guess that is all." An hour later, the girl groped her way to her room; a servant had been around extinguishing the upper lights. Her room was at the head of the broad, grand stair-way. The lights from the lower hall streamed up; led by some ,strange, unaccountable impulse, she went to the head of the stairs and looked down. Clare was descending the steps with noiseless tread; she started; his apartments were in the opposite portion of the building. What had brought him there? She turned to her own room: the door was slightly ajar. Asi she remembered she had closed it; she entered, and locked it after her. What could have brought Clare there? He could not 22*   258       HONOR BRIGHT. even have been to his mother's apartments, since they too were in one of the distant towers. The incident annoyed, disturbed her; and withal, she was so nervous, with this sense of coming ill, she could not sleep, so at length gave over the effort: arising and going over to the casement, and kneeling there. She had extinguished the light, and now parted the drapery wide until the whole room was flooded with the yellow moonlight. Beneath her lay the rolling, undulating landscape; in the distance, looming up against the sky, a dark irregular line of mountains, and here and there, stretches of rich green woodland, whilst between lay meadow and field, bright, waving, and yellow to the harvest; all forming the rich contrast, the softened harmonious blending -of light and shade, that moonlight causes; whilst over all was stretched the deep blue sky, its stars shadowy in the presence of the bright golden moon, with its horizon fringed and irregular broken by the rolling landscape. To use a wornout metaphor, sleep is much like love; whilst courted it is shy and offish, but as soon as neg- lected, seeks, where before it slighted, and speedily be- comes the woer. So a very little after, the moonbeams gathered where their bright reflex was lost in the golden hair of the kneeling sleeper. Her face was pillowed on the sill, whilst the long, dark lashes lay heavy on cheeks grown sadly wan and pale in those weary weeks. Music! heavenly, rapturous, divine! now rich and powerful, now sinking into softest, sweetest cadence! The air was burdened; it filled the very glistening of the moonlight! Music heard in dreams! Were they choral notes from the heavenly throng? The sleeper roused, her hands clasped in adoration, her dark eyes raised heaven- ward. Suddenly it died. She arose, opened her door softly,   tONfOR BRIGHT.        259 and stole out to the head of the broad stairway. Every- where darkness,-save a faint stream of light from one tiny taper. It came from the music room. She waited until she saw the master pass through one of the fretted arches to an opposite hall, with a night-lamp in his hand. She watched him out of sight, then stole noiselessly to bed, and slept in perfect peace and trust. Yet sAe had ac- cused this man of a mortal sin I CHAPTER XX IV. "Conscience and grace to the profoundest pit; I dare damnation!" ,ITAXMT.1. SHE overslept herself. The sun had mounted high when she was awakened by the patter of tiny feet, and a sweet, lisping cry at the door, "Baby wants in, her do; open the door and yet Baby in, kick!" The imperative little tyrant was instantly admitted; behind her came Mrs. Mallory, with a gentle, smiling face. "Good-morning, love; you have had a good, long sleep," she said, in her kind, motherly way. "Is it late? '" asked the girl in surprise. "Wery yate; you a seepy-head," put in Birdie saucily, whilst Mrs. Mallory replied,- "No, dear; not so very late; only Mark was home to breakfast, and you have missed him; I am so sorry." She knew full well he had been there, and frankly admitted the fact.   260       HONOR BRIGHT. Cc Yes, I heard the organ in the night." "Did you, dear? It was an odd freak took Mark. I wish it would take him oftener. He said he had a fancy that some one was sick, and that he was needed at home. He could not get rid of the thought, so came to convince himself of his folly." The girl's -lark eyes were full of wonder. He, too, had had that foreboding of evil. Mrs. Mallory did not detect the expression, and went on, a little deprecatingly, with a half-apology in her voice,- "Charity, dear, Mark thinks I am looking badly, and insists on my having a change of air and scene at once. Would you mind playing at housekeeping a while?" The girl started, changing color, the intangible fear suddenly merging into a sort of horror. Mrs. Mallory saw the start, and misinterpreted it, saying,- "I shall not go, love. I knew it was selfish to even think of it. You would be sQ lonely. I wanted to take you with me, but Clare says an interruption now would break the thread of his romance past uniting." Charity exclaimed earnestly, her face flushing,- "Dear Mrs. Mallory, you cannot think me so ungrate- ful, or so infinitely selfish! You need the change! it will do you good; you are pale and wan with this ener- vating weather. I am very glad, not sorry. You quite misunderstood me! Does Birdie go with you?" snatch- ing up the child, and caressing her to hide the anxiety in the question. "Yes, dear; she is looking thin, and is losing her pretty dimples. We are going to Saratoga; I' feel as if a goblet of those sparkling waters would be like a draught of the ' elixir'of life.'" "I suppose Old Reliable goes with you," quite indiffer- ently, and toying with Birdie's jewelled sleeve-loops.   HONOR BRIGHT.         261 "Yes; Mark did not feel satisfied with any other arrangement. He considers her invaluable in case of sickness. At first, she declared she would not go; but everybody yields to lMark," withea proud smile. Birdie, with the restlessness of childhood, had slipped off her lap, and was toddling about the room. "How soon do you go?" "We start in about an hour. I have been packing for the last two hours."' "And I enacting the sluggard's part in ' a little more sleep,"' with an effort at gayety. "Is there anything I can do to assist you, now?" "No, love; run and get your breakfast; then come to my room until we leave.' She obeyed instantly, glad to escape the simulated unconcern. She lingered over her breakfast, not eating, but absorbed in thought; striving to analyze the nature of this strange foreboding, which had so completely taken possession of her, this sort of supernatural horror which enchained her. Superstition s o trenching on reason as to enfeeble its powers, rendering her its slave. What had she to fear? She had kept house once before; they would probably not be gone much longer now than then, She could not definee her fear; the house was thoroughly protected, with its corps of well-trained servants; besides, she never thought of burglars. Surely, her dread was not of uncanny things! She laughed to scorn the idea of being subject to eldritch influences; and with a. half troubled, half contemptuous smile, gave over the attempt to solve the subtle mystery by which the long shadows of coming events fall across our present, and make us shiver in their sudden, gray cold. One fact, above all others, puzzled her; not only she, but Mr. Mallory and Old Reliable, had, at the same time, experienced the   262        HONOR BRIGHT. prescience of evil; but she thrust even that thought aside, maligning herself as a miserable coward, shrinking from the shadows of nothing, and an egregious egotist, think- ing wholly of self, without taking into consideration the pleasure this trip would afford them all, especially Old Reliable, who never, within her memory, had been away from the Institute. So, with a half-formed orison to her Maker for protection from any evil life might have folded out of her sight, she,went up to Mrs. Mallory's room. For the next hour, there was the bustle and confusion pertinent to an unexpected journey. Old Reliable con- stantly strove to catch Charity alone, but she baffled every effort. The old woman's face was a curious study; the scroll-like lips were rolled down at the corners, to lugubrious length, and. the double glasses were constantly dim, requiring continual clearing; whilst the puzzled hands, acting quite without the control of the engrossed mind,-persisted in misplacing them, putting the outside pair to the inside, thus causing both to slip to the end of the up-turned nose. At length, amid bustle, and flurry, and kissing, and waving of handkerchiefs, the carriage rolled from the door. Charity ran quickly up to a casement in an upper corridor, which commanded an extensive view, to watch them out of sight. When they were lost in the bend of the road, she still lingered. Field, mountain, and hollow, even the corridors, were flooded with ambient sunshine. It is a black fear, that even the sunlight cannot quite efface. Through all the glory of these shining golden beams streaked dark lines of apprehension, which, like ebon clasps, seemed to bind the future with the present. Of all pagans, the Peruvians, who worship the sun, seem the most sapient. Of all God's creations, it is the easiest   HONOR BRIGHT.         263 converted into an idol. Crime shrinks from its face, whilst good deeds love the light. Purity and beauty are intensified by its rays; whilst corruption consumes itself in all the repelling horrors of decompositon. So this sunlight rendered the girl's intangible fear all the more startling, because, though so plain, yet undefined. She reasoned, and laughed at herself; said her imagina- tion was growing morbid,-her mind losing its healthy tenor. But her reasoning was boldly defied; her laugh- ing proved so much idle persiflage. This strong, self- reliant woman was bowing in abject, almost slavish weakness, to what she herself termed a foolish supersti- tion. Yet, since God first gave man a tireless brain, and throbbing heart, he has sent him signs and premo- nitions. We are forbidden to draw away the curtain which veils the "mystic beyond;" but, as upon the stage, in the bustle of preparation, and the excitement of the scene about to be represented, the actors 'them- selves will brush aside the screening folds, thus dis- closing  brief glimpses to the eager audience,-so, sometimes, the intensity, either of joy or anguish, in the next scene of our life-drama, serves as a self-revealer. Wearied with this unequal conflict, this fighting with phantoms, the girl turned her back upon the sunlight, i-  - conquered. An hour later, she entered Clare's study.   He was waiting for her, a trifle inpatiently. His face was tired and haggard, as if he had not slept. "You are not well, Clare?" she said, kindly. "Yes, well enough; but I    have put in a d  d night," in an unnatural tone. "You were sick?" [paying no heed to the hard   lan- guage. s   264        HONOR BRIGHT. "Yes," with a laugh full of poignant irony. His manner Vras very strange; it alarmed her. She thought he had a fever, and wished, with a sense of utter desolation, that Old Reliable, at least, had re- mained. He saw the anxiety on her face, and said, captiously, - "There is nothing the matter; we will begin work." She took her accustomed seat at the secretary, pen in hand, waiting. There was -a long silence. Usually, his prolific, versatile mind had a ready flow of thoughts, and language rare and choice with which to clothe them. At first, so absorbed was she in her own troubling thoughts, she did not notice the strange, unwonted silence, but at length it startled her. She glanced up quickly. The humpback, instead of reclining, as usual, among the soft, luxurious cushions of his lounge, stood directly beside her. "Ha! ha! ha! You scoff at my power. Yet I can instantly attract your glance. First, you are restless and uneasy without knowing why; then they come to mine,--those dark, brilliant, lustrous eyes." He was bending over her, until his long, beautiful hair mingled with hers. She trembled from the sudden start, so unnerved was she, then drew back, in a distant, dignified way. "Clare, I'll not be made a subject of experiment," she said, angrily. He laughed, a ringing, exultant laugh. "You cannot help it. You may resist, fight, rebel; you are utterly powerless; my spirit wields, yaours can but yield." It sounded so like raving, she looked at him with a sort of anxious compassion. He was resting against the secretary. She had pushed back her chair, and was   HONOR BRIOHT.         265 regarding him with steady, fearless eyes. He was silent a moment, then, with his whimsical, capricious mood, abruptly changed the subject. "Mark was here to breakfast." "So your mother 'told me," indifferently '"Ha! ha ha! You thinlk to cheat me I You can- not do it. You knew it before she told you! You felt his approach! You knew the moment he entered the 'house. My spirit, keeping guard over yours, saw the quickened heart beat, felt the vibration of the pulse." Her cheeks grew deathly pale. She said, in a cold, imperative voice, --,  "Clare, I came here to write. If you require my services, I will remain; if not, please say so;" and she partly arose. He laid his hand, wonderfully strong for so weak a frame, upon her shoulder. -"Stay! You wish me to understand that you are simply my amanuensis.  I'll not forget." Ad, with a light, mocking laugh, he went back to his lounge. After that, there was the dull, monotonous tone of dictation. This romance, of which we have before told, with the unearthly power of spirit over spirit for its plot. Each day it had grown in intensity of interest and excite- ment. The girl had felt its wondrous power, even in the midst of the actual trouble that was upon her. To-day, a new character found its way into the weird fascination of the tale. A strange, startling creature, more a power than a being, represented as a deformed contorted soul, who hid its hideous proportions beneath a robe of exqui- site fabric. It was the conception of a diseased, morbid mind.  The girl -turned paler yet at his introduction. le was represented as having fallen; as being given /3    266       HONOR BRIGHT. over to the power of the evil one, and seeking by cun- ning guile, by winning deceit, to lure souls to perdition, To the innocent, he appeared an angel of light, to whom sin was utterly impossible. He won their love and adoration; elicited their confidence; led them down by gradual, easy descent to hell. Two spirits loved each other; this soul sought to separate them. The one had endured temptation and overcome; meeting the soul in single combat, had, with inspired strength, thrown aside the glittering robe, and discovered, with horror and amaze, the frightful proportions, the fearful deceit. Now he sought in vain to convince his beloved of her delusion;: but she was deaf to his entreaties, dazed and bewildered by the dazzling aureole of his supernatural fascinations. So the morning, aye, the whole day passed. At noon Clare ordered lunch served there. He eat nothing, but drank dedply. Charity never left the secretary. Even-  ing came, and dinner was announced. Even then, when the meal was concluded, the humpback said, "I am in the mood; we will write an hour or two longer," with a cool, insolent glance at the girl, that suddenly recalled those words, "You wish me to understand that you are simply my amanuensis. I'll not forget it." She had never written at night, before; had never been in the study by any other than daylight. A costly lamp of curious design stood upon the secretary, whilst the light, softened and tinted, streamed from beneath a shade of delicate workmanship, and fell directly upon the bowed head of the amanuensis. The author, on his distant lounge, was thus thrown in the shadow, there being no other light in the room, save what poured in' through the wide thrown doors. Not a sound disturbed the low, monotonous tone, nor the steady gliding of the   HO LOR BRIGHT.         26g pen, save the occasional step of a servant through the marble halls. So, an hour, aye two, passed, yet the word of release was not spoken, whilst all the time, the romance increased in its fearful fascinations, sin and crime being fused in virtue until the dividing line was utterly obliterated; whilst over all was cast a luring glamour of false reasoning, so apparently true, that it would have taken a mind with clearest discernment, with most thoroughly balanced strength, to have discovered its subtle sophistry. Suddenly, the pen of the amanuensis grew still, but so wrapped was the author in his terrible conception, he did not notice it. The bowed head, was raised, a faint flush crept up to her very brow, the white lips Were set and firm;she turned full and suddenly upon the hump: back.  The light streaming brightly across her face, and seeming centred and focused there, revealed with minute distinctnessevery tense line, every strong characteristic. The humpback started. "Clare Mallory, I refuse to write another word," she said in a voice of cold dignity. His beautiful face was marred, contorted. - "You are my amanuensis," insolently . "Never, from this instant," with calm decision. He turned as white as death, seeming stunned, power- less. She went on remorselessly, - "These last pages shall never go out into the world, with their pernicious  fascination, in my handwriting," as she spoke, she had made a roll of the papers; now, with   fir-m, steady hand, she lifted the shade, holding them to the light, until they spent themselves in blu e and yellow flames. The humpback sprang to his feet; as h e  did so, something fell heavily to the floor, but he ailed to observe it and in an instant was at her side;   268        HONOR BRIGBT. with his hand, seeming almost supernatural in its strength for so weak and frail a frame, grasping her arm. The clutch was so fierce, so cruel, she was obliged to set her lips to suppress a cry of pain. "( You will rue this!" There was a tone of terrible threatening in his voice. She looked him steadily in the eye, though a white like of suffering gathered all about her lips at the cruel, relentless clutch. He saw it, and laughed demoniacally. "Why don't you tell me I hurt you? too proud! Ha! ha! ha! You thought I had no strength! You'll admit my power, too, perhaps, with that same white face."' She shuddered; she was growing faint, sick, reeling, at the continued pain. She bit her lips, then with the free hand cleared her vision and looked him fearlessly in the eyes. "Clare, release my arm this instant." Few men would have dared disobey the quiet command in those dark eyes; he freed her with a half-baffled, half- insolent laugh. Faint and sick, she laid her head upon , the secretary, her pale face covered from his sight. A moment there was silence, then the white, delicate hand of the humpback was laid tenderly on the bruised arm, whilst the voice, full of remorse, asked, - ( Did I hurt you much, Charity?" See looked up at him coldly. ,' Yes, terribly." "Will you forgive me?" pleadingly. ( No," in a firm, decided way. He fell on his knees beside her, his frail hands, with their terrible latent strength, clasped in supplica- tion; his face, never more startlingly beautiful, upturned to hers, the dark, eloquent eyes suffused with tears; the   H1ONOR BRIGHT.       269 lips, those full, voluptuous lips, quivering and trembling like a grieved child's. "Charity, forgive me! I would die this moment to hear you say that you forgive me," in passionate en- treaty; then continue4 wildly, ' I was mad, demented, crazed! I felt that I was the stronger; that you were mine! the possession was delicious, rendered all the more exquisite by your very suffering, since I had power to cause that suffering!"Then, in impassioned supplication, "You should not blame me for my mood; my mother gave it me when she gave my hideous, deformed figure. If spirit and body are twins, am I to blame? Say once kindly, ' Clare, I forgive you,' or kill me where I kneel!" She pitied him, with his morbid disposition; he had said he had been mad, raving; she fully believed it, so, though her head was raised in cold, forbidding dignity, she said kindly, - "Clare, I forgive you." He seized her hands and covered them with amorous kisses. She drew them away angrily. "Clare, forgiveness but leads to fresh offense. You torment, distract lime! I have not a minute's peace! I wish I might never see you again!" she said vehemently. "Be rid of me, then, Charity," with a terrible calm in his voice. "How?" shuddering, as-if instinctively anticipating the fearful reply. "Kill me." She started almost to her feet, crying, - "Clare Mallory, are you stark mad?" He laughled a ringing, elfish laugh. " Mad!" sarcastically, then adding in a fierce tone, - "You are always accusing- me of madniess; I believe youwould have me in a straight jacket if you dared. Why 23*   270       HONOR BRIGHT. should it seem like madness for me to be willing to have the woman I love even kill me? By freeing my spirit from its hideous clay, it would only fly to a closer em- brace with hers. I would kill you gladly, I would take you in my arms and with you leap from yonder vine- wreathed veranda down into the abyss beneath, and think it a wild excess of joy." She was silent. He had risen and was standing beside her, his long hair dishevelled about his face, whose won- drous beauty was now enhanced and intensified by the brilliancy of excitement, he laid his hand heavily on her shoulder. "Charity, hear me once for all. You persist in erring. This passion, that you insultingly term madness, is simply love." "Clare, that is an interdicted subject," she began coldly. He interrupted ier,-- "No, never again from this time forbidden; I love you; and shall tell you of it, and you shall love me; and more,- you shall be mine I You may fight against it, .it is sure to come; my spirit claims, yours will yield; the possession is inevitable, there is no use to struggle with fate." She threw his hand from her shoulder. He went on,- "You will leave here, you have decided so before, but Mark forbade it, and like every one else, you obeyed his indomitable will; now you are determined, no one can hinder you, but what will be the use? I shall follow you, haunt you; you will be only the more fully in my power: you are mine I you canndot escape me!" She was like one bound hand and foot, dulmb with terror. Was this the realization of her presentiment? this the evil foreboded? She tried to arise from her chair, but was faint and powerless; his hand, that white, slender, blue-veined hand like a mountaini weight upon    HONOR BRIGET.          271 her shoulder. Physically, she was weaker than he, and, at that moment, through terror, mentally weaker too. And the humpback saw his power. A strange expression lighted up the startling beauty of his face; he stooped until his long hair rested on hers, saying in an amorous, ardent tone, - "My own, your spirit acknowledges its lord; it feels my possession. Why longer strive? but yield and be my wife and he covered her brow and cheeks with passionate kisses. It roused her. With supernatural strength she threw him from her and left the study. As she did so, her foot struck some hard substance. She glanced instinctively at the floor; something bright lay half buried in the soft vel- vet carpet. Wild with fright she paused not, but ran quickly up the broad grand stairway. The upper lights were already extinguished; she grope'd her way to her apartment, scarce conscious of the darkness, only seeking to escape the presence of this man. When    she had reached it she entered, closing the door quickly. The room was full of moonlight; it looked white and deathly, filling her with terror; she excluded it hastily, and struck a light. She had been insulted, grossly insulted; that was the thought dominant in her mind. Her face seemed scorched blistered with those kisses. She went to the casement to cool her fevered brow. For the time hate reigned su- preme in the girl's heart. She hated this man; she could have felled him  to the earth had she had the power. How had he,dared, beneath his own brother's roof, and she alone, utterly unprotected? She would not live be- neath that roof another day. It was no shelter, it had held naught but trouble for her; she would leave it. Out of doors was the moonlight, yellow on mountain sward and   272        ON OR BIGaHT. hollow, it brought back the intangible fear of the night before, which the sunlight of the morning had only inten- sified, now in its terrible realization. The fear and hate grew into a wild uncontrollable terror; her strong self reli- ant nature was paralyzed with a sickening horror. She had not locked her door. She ran hastily towards it, the key was gone.  Could she at any time during the day have brushed it out in passing? She searched the room with' eager eyes, then opened the door, setting the lamp in it, and feeling all along the tesselated floor outside with nervous hands. It was not there. A thought presented itself, growing into a fixed con- viction as soon as conceived,- she had struck' her key with her foot as she left the study; it was that Clare had dropped. He had been trying to obtain it when she sur- prised him on the staircase the night before. The blood coursed through her veins first a stream of liquid fire, then seemed congealed to ice.    . Everywhere was silence and darkness. She looked over the stairway; the lights below had been extinguished since she entered her room; the darkness was intense, impene- trable, save where a faint glimmer stole through the richly stained glass doors of the study. They were closed. The humpback was still there. Every soul in that grand castle slept save this man and this woman. She was like one mad. She returned to her room shut- ting out the blackness. She remembered, with sickening horror, his supernatural strength, impish, fiendish in one of so frail a figure. Then, too, the long intersecting halls and vacant ranges of apart- ments that separated her from all human aid, and that aid, if reached, such as hired menials alone icould give,   /     H'OOR  BRIGHT. B       273 3 whom she shuddered to have know her danger.    She glanced at the clock; it was long past midnight; she was white, faint and trembling; she stood against her unlocked door.  Of what avail would her resistance be to the fierce, unnatural strength of that slight arm; one blow would throw it wide. Excessive terror brought great beads of perspiration to her brow. Hark! a faint distant sound; she sprang quickly to the table, extinguishing the light, The drawn drapery ex- eluded every moonbeam; darkness, intense, terrible! and silence'most oppressive. Should she shriek for help?"Who would hear?" called back the silence, mockingly. Hearing grew terribly keen and vision frightfully clear in the darkness. Each amorous look, each word of love or threat came back with the vividness of reality. She crouched down by the door, a little to one side, .her ear to the key-hole. Perfect silence; its very intensity seemed ominous, like the calm preceding a storm., The tension on mind and nerve was cruel, severe; she could not bear it, she should go mad. A wild thought flashed across her strained, bewildered brain. She sprang to her feet seizing a shawl from-where it had been carelessly tossed on a chair near by, and threw it about her, then noiselessly opened the door and stole out into the wider, more expansive darkness of the hall. Her light tread, to her keen, excited hearing, sounded like mountain weight on the marble floor.  She gained the stairway; the mas- sive oak seemed to creak and groan. She had taken scarce a half a dozen steps down, when, suddenly, at the stairway's foot, the- study-door was thrown open wide, and in the bright light that streamed. out, stood the humpback. His long hair was wild and dishevelled about his beautiful face, now frightfully con-   274        HONOR BRrIGT. torted by passion, and with a look of fierce, cruel deter- mination about his full, voluptuous lips. A moment he stood thus, looking up the stairs, peer- ing searchingly into the 'darkness. Above, the black dress, a part of it, the figure, mute, paralyzed and motion- less as a thing of stone, gave no sound. His head turned a little to listen; the face with its beauty lost in passion; the figure deformed; stunted, all brought out in, bold, sharp relief from the blackness beyond. One hand, aided the attentive ear, the other clenched fiercely, the veins knotted to thick cords. With vision frightfully clear, she saw it all-this part of the darkness, this stunned, mute creature, this almost thing of stone. A moment's pause, then the study-door was closed-- darkness, intense, despairin'g! And this man and this woman, each tiny instant, each vibration of the air, bringing them nearer. The stealthy tread, the groping in the blind, uncertain dark; and above, breathless despair, horrible suspense. Nearer, nearer, with the long arm characteristic of the humpback, stretching out before him. Would it strike her as he passed '? The massive oaken steps gave no sound to tell his close approach, only the beating of the air with his hand and the costly jewels on the slender fingers scraping the cpri- ously carved banisters. The seconds grew to very years in' this fearful suspense, in this intensity of horror. Closer, closer, the air, beaten back, struck her brow; she felt his hot, blighting breath, heard him mutter be- tween his set teeth,- "Mine! I can only be d  d for it, at most!" This man and this woman, with scarce an inch of dense   HONOR BaRHT.          27 darkness separating them - Darkness ! aye, the omnipo. tent hand of God I " Thus far shalt thou come, and no farther."

She stood mute, immobile, until he gained the marble hall above, then, strong with hope of deliverance, few down the broad stairway, through the arch with its "Honor Bright,"lost in the darkness, yet still there, to the main entrance, turned the ponderous keys, rolled back the massive doors, sounding like the rumbling of thunder to her keen sense, then closing each, was out in the night. .  . CHAPTER XXV. "Let the wild falcon soar her swing, She'll stoop when she has tired her wing." ALONE. The night with its yellow moonlight, its dead, mysterious silence. Across the velvet lawn, around the rambling side of the turreted castle, down the natural steps in the precipi- tous bluff, with daring fearless speed.  Everywhere silence almost appalling, even the brook not so much as whispering in the still August heat, and the breeze creeping sluggishly amongst the sharp angles and abrupt curves of this rough, wild mountain gorge. With white face, with wild, bewildered eyes, with eager speed, like one pursued, on and -on through its sinuous course; every ill-shaped rock, every dwarfed, gnarled stump assuming those dread proportions; every sudden  breeze coming round an abrupt curve, his heated breath. She knew no weariness, no lagging, flying from sin.   276        EONOR BRIGHT. On and on, until the, mountain sides sank to rough, broken hills, then rolled away in graceful undulations, thus meeting the highway. Then the burying-ground, its white stones gleaming in the moonlight, passed; the lonely, scattered suburbs reached; then the closely-built, deserted streets of the sleeping town, with the moonlight on the closed shutters, and far above, an occasional taper, with its feeble light streaming through an open window, marking where one was keeping vigils, or where watchers stood by sick beds, or where the deadl Jay shrouded. Up one street, down another, in a dazed, bewildered fashion, as if in search of way-marks, often coming back to the same point in horrible confusion; at length, through tortuous course, she reached the town's hither side; then the moonlight was lost in the smoke and glare of the yet distant furnace. A huge chimera, vomiting forth fire, the dull, dingy wall brought out in bold relief, and the blackened, be- smutted men, who fed the yawning monster, looking like gnomes in its red glare. She crept up in the shadow, looking through a large aperture in the wall. The ore ran, a molten stream of flame, into its mqlds; the men, like creatures of another world, their oil-silk caps hiding their faces, save the eyes, directing its course. They were casting; thus, for the first time she saw it, a bitter curl on her livid lips at the thought. She crept close to the walls, following the shadows to escape detec- tion, her eager face turned upward, as if in -search of something. Round and round the sharp angles, a look of despair mingling with the dazed, ,bewildered expression. Now a   HONOR BRIGHT.          2 sudden pause, a step back to where the shadows fringed the red glare, the head thrown, back, the eyes upturned. Above was an open window, with lace drapery parted and the faint glimmer of lamp-light streaming through.          . A moment's perplexity; then a handful of gravel-stones hit the side of the building, theirpatter lost in the din and roar. Again, scarce a half a yard below, only, the more disappointing for its very nqarness. Again, O blessed third time with thy charm! they fell, a shower, upon the velvet carpet. Above, a face in the window; below, a figure wrapped in black. There was no question. It was not the first time such a figure had been seen at night. The faint lamp-light was extinguished, a moment's silence, then she was clinging to him, dumb, faint, trembling. "Charity!"   The voice was full of amaze and alarm. "What has brought you here at this hour of the night ? Who is ill ? What has gone wrong ? - tell me ! Speak !" *imperatively. The white lips parted in a vain struggle for words for a moment, then the voice came with a   strange, unnatural calmness, and she told'him all the story of her insulted womanhood, not brokenly, nor incoherently, but quietly, almost apathetically, through very excess. The, master was terrible in his anger.  He   spoke no word, but his face grew  fierce, livid, stern, whilst the arms that had refused to uphold her even, when clinging to hiin faint and reeling, now. were thrown. protectingly about her, and lifted her as if a child, carrying her thus to where a sharp angle of the building securely screened them from any stray workman.  There was a  door there, 24 In  278       HONOR BRIGHT., and several rude steps leading up to it. He placed her on the lowest, then stood beside her with folded arms. This cold proud man, his usually immobile face worked convulsively in his effort for control. He did not men- tion his brother's name, he asked no further questions, neither assured her of protection - there was no need - only stood silently regarding her. The reaction had come; the tense nerves relaxed. She buried her face in her hands and cried bitterly. He did not seek to soothe her, but let her have the cry out, then knelt beside her, taking both her hands in his, so revealing the white, weary face, with its tear stains. He regarded it searchingly. "( Charity, are you strong enough to walk home?" She clung to him. "Oh, I cannot I You would not be so cruel as to send mie there again?" impetuously, and trembling violently at the thought.      , A            . He disengaged one of his hands from her nervous clasp, and taking the white, frightened face in it, looked keenly at it, saying in that tone of quiet questioning: "Will you be afraid when I am with you?" "No," meeting the eyes trustfully. There was a flash of triumph in the proud face. He had told her the time would come when she would trust him. It had I "Will you stay there with me?" eagerly. This woman, who not a month since had vaunted in her power to live alone, now pleading for protection; this woman, who, in her strong self-reliance, he had taunted with having nothing clinging in her nature, now entreating support. There was a bit of a curve to his lips at the remembrance.   HONOR BRIGHT.        '279 C Yes, I will stay with you," he said, quietly, and arose, standing beside her again. "I will go now," she said, attempting to rise, but tot- tering in the effort. He put his arm about her to help her. "You are not strong enough to walks" he said, anxiously. "Yes, I can. I can go quite alone," steadying herself, 'as he released her. An odd play to his lips at the touch of old independence. "You should ride, but that the men would know it," he said, with a proud guarding of her name. Then, her hand within his arm, he lead her ever in the shadow, until they left the mammoth forge far behind. He took a direct short route through the town. Her step was uncertain, her hand upon his arm, clinging. They had left the burying-ground behind them and., reached the ravine. The master had scarce spoken a word since they left the furnace; his face was stern and angry, with a white line all about the firm, set lips. . Every moment the girl's step grew feebler, and the hand on his arm limp and lifeless. He noticed it, and stooping, looked into her face. "You cannot walk any more," in that quiet tone of assertion. ., She shook her head hopelessly. "It wants but a few minutes of daylight. You must be in before then," he said, in perplexity. Nature spent, tried beyond endurance, had refused action. She seeimed sinking to the earth. Mark Mallory was not a man to oscillate between two opinions. His decision was quickly made. He bowed his head.   280       BONOR BRIGHT. "Charity, put your arms around my neck," he said, coolly;. A faint color came even to those white wan cheeks. She hesitated. He did not repeat the command, simply waited for it to be obeyed. , It was done, and, stooping, he lifted the slight figure in his strong arms, as easily, as gracefully as if she had been a babe. Help had been given none too sqon; for a moment she was utterly lost to the world of consciousness. A nervous man would have stopped to revive her with water from the brook. Not so Mark Mallory. The ex- igency was great. She must be home before her absence was discovered. The servants must not see her enter. So he left Nature to make its own cure. Speedily she revived, speaking no word, but looking straight before. This man and this woman loved each other, yet at that moment he was to her none other than a protector, she to him, a woman needing aid. Was the man made of iron? His step was as light and free as if he bore no burden, and with ever-increasing speed. The moon had set, and over the land and down in the ravine liad fallen the gloom of that " darkest hour just before daylight."  Above them loomed the turrets of Bright Institute., "I am strong, now. I can walk," she said. He paid no heed, but with agile step ascended the pre- cipitous bluff, nor set her down until they stood in the main entrance. The massive doors were rolled back noiselessly, and they stood in the grand octagon hall. "Will you stay here while I bring a light?" he asked, in a low tone. A moment she clung to him in horror, at the thought   - HONOR BRIGHT.        281 of being in that terror-haunted place alone, then the old stoical look came to her face. She whispered, "Yes." He was gone but a moment, returning with a small night-lamp in his hand, then led her to the foot of the broad stairway with its fearful memories. The light'in the study had been extinguished. Silence reigned. "Take this with you; look about your apartments, and then sleep. I shall be here," he said, handing her the night-lamp. She was standing a step or two above him, so that her face was brought even with his; the light she held fell fell across it, revealing its pallor, its tense drawn lines. "You are afraid?" coldly. "Afraid? no!" with a little trustful smile; then the disengaged hand was laid earnestly on his shoulder, "Mr. Mallory, you will not speak to Clare." His face was like marble in its -white anger. The hand on his shoulder lingered in mute pleading, the hard lines a little relaxed,-        ' - "I will not until I have seen you again; let that sat- isfy you," kindly. Still she lingered hesitatingly. "Well?" in a questioning tone. She did not offer him the gratitude so hateful to him, only stooped and kissed his hand very humbly,-this proud, dignified, retiring woman, - then turned and went up to her room. The blood rushed to the man's very brow at the touch of those lips, but the darkness covered it, '. as it did, too, the face, when the flush had died, -a face white, stern, and with its habitual immobility concealing every thought.  So he stood with folded arms, a staunch, proud sentinel, until the day broke. Thus a night had passed.. Such had it brought to three lives.   'EONOR BRIGHT. CHAPTER XXVI. " In the chamber of fate, where, through tremulous hands, Hum the threads from an old-fashioned distaff uncurled, And these three blind old women sit spinning the world." OWEN MEREDITH. ONLY a night. Now it was morning; the same earth, the same air, the same sky, bending over all; the material world utterly unchanged,l whilst the moral world was shaken and perturbed, its laws broken, its subjects,- the soul, heart, mind, passions, - running rio t. It was a morning of intense Suffocating heat. The sun from the eastern horizon had been a ball of fire, and now was climbing with fierce, relentless glory to its meridian. What prompted the girl ? That morning she wore white. Was it emblematic ? Her bright hair was knotted loosely at the back of her shapely head, and swept in successive ripples from her brow; her face, sad and earnest, had never been so perfectly the face of Beatrice. She opened the door and stepped into the corridor, still pregnant with the horror of the night. The drapery in each casement had been drawn to exclude the fierce, pene- trating heat; the unusual shade was in consonance with the impenetrable gloom which had gathered about her life. The subdued light served to-bring into ghastly relief each horrible memory of that sin-haunted passage. Sick and faint, every nerve shattered by the severe tension imposed upon them, the girl started and grew pale, as if a sudden apparition had grossed her path, when, at the stairway head, she encountered Mrs. Mallory.   " You have returned! What has happened ?" The lady's gentle face was full of anxiety. c Little Birdie is ill; we were afraid to go on. Relia- ble said home was the place for her." "When did you come ?" "About an hour since. I am just going to my break- fast; we will go together." While partaking of the meal, Mrs. Mallory related the incidents of the preceding day. How that they had only gone about twenty miles distant, when Birdie had seemed to droop, growing very white about the mouth, and put- ting her little hands constantly to her head. They had lingered at the hotel all day, hoping she would be able to go on. She had spent the night in moaning and tossing. They had taken a carriage at daylight and driven home. The girl listened with a passiveness that verged on apathy. Mrs. Mallory abruptly changed the subject. "Mark is home, dear. I have made him promise to stay all day; the heat is so excessive, I am afraid to have him out. Then ere the girl had need to reply, she added, anx- iously,-  "This heated term is terrible; if we do not soon have a respite, I tremble for the result. Clare looks really sick already, andI am so uneasy about little Birdie." " Do you apprehend any danger ?" "No, but she seems so languid, so enervated by the heat," then adding, as they went arm in arm to join the family circle, - "I feel so unaccountably depressed, if I were supersti- tious I should think it was an omen;" and after a mo- ment's silence, "I am glad to see you in white, child, we are such a sombre set of women." They went to the drawing-room, it being located in the western portion of the building, thus fairly shaded; the   HONOR BRIGHT. brothers were there, the elder sitting in an easy chair, wheeled directly in the French window, apparently read- ing; the other reclining among the cushions of the lounge; whilst beyond, on the veranda Old Reliable carried little Birdie back and forth. The girl took in their several positions at one quick glance, then her eyes wandered to where the humpback lay. She started. He was clad in a white linen suit; it affected her unpleasantly like a shroud; his long wavy hair was swept back over the cushion, his face was wan and haggard; the lashes lay upon his pale cheeks as though more from utter exhaustion than sleep; whilst every line about eye and lip, plainly proclaimed him the victim of uncontrolled passions, the total wreck of a nature God had wonderfully endowed. Mrs. Mallory had passed out on the veranda to join Reliable with the child, the girl had paused near the door with characteristic earnestness and forgetfulness of self, taking in this picture so startlingly beautiful but with its sad lesson. The master had closed his book, and was watching her; presently her eyes met his. Surely it was a trying position, this girl, brought into the immediate presence of these two brothers, with the night's terrible experience overflowing the darkness which had sought in vain to' contain it, and thus wholly filling the day. A moment she stood battling for control, the blood ebbing and flowing with painful rapidity, but she con- quered, as he had seen her so many times, and came into the room to the very window where he sat. By closer view he too looked haggard and spent, with hard, stern lines about his lips. "You are tired?" she said, in a low, hesitating tone. t..   C No," quietly, and as he spoke rolling an ottoman into the window for her. She sat down quite at his feet resting her head on her hand, and gazing out at the win- dow with a sad, dreary expression. Everywhere there was silence; in the drawing room; on the veranda, for little Birdie had fallen asleep. The very air was hushed and still; not a bird twittered; not a leaf stirred; and beyond the immediate shade of the gray building, the sun poured down its red heat like liquid fire on mountain, woods, and ravine, whilst the very brook flowed in a noiseless, sluggish way. Not a sound save the swaying to and fro of the large palm-leaf, with which Old Reliable fanned little Birdie. The silence was most oppressive. Charity." The voice that broke it was weak and feeble; the girl started nervously, glancing to the distant lounge from whence it came; the humpback had partly risen on his pillow, with a look of entreaty on his pallid face. A moment the girl hesitated, then the woman in her conquered; she arose and went toward him. "I am faint; will you make me a sherry-cobbler?" pleadingly. She left the room, and a few moments later returned, with a goblet on a little silver tray, the ice tinkling re- freshingly against the glass. She placed it on a light stand beside him without so much as speaking one word; he thanked her very humbly, she acknowledged it with a little cold inclination of the head, then returned to her seat in the window. The master had been watching her; his immobile face revealing nothing of what he thought. The humpback drained the goblet eagerly, then seemed to sleep again. The girl was looking out of the window as before; the   286       EONOR BI1GHET. master leaned forward a trifle so as to intercept her gaze; she flushed a little. "Charity suffereth long and is kind," he said quietly; then added in a bitter tone,- "I have need to learn of you." She looked distressed. "You will say nothing yet?" earnestly. is When?" in a cold, hard undertone. "It would be cruel to strike the fallen." He sat erect and stern. At that moment there was a step in the marble hall, and Selden entered. Clare was not sleeping; you could see that plainly by the expression about his full lips, as the man entered, though he never opened his eyes. The master rose to meet him in his hospitable, cour- teous manner. -Little Birdie had awakened, and they brought her in, thinking the air less heated there than on the veranda. The white line which Charity had descried about the little creature's mouth, those two nights before, had spread until the usually rosy face was wan and ashen; the large dark eyes heavy and sunken, and every other expression merged and lost in that one so strangely, piti- fully sad of which we have told. There was no lisping complaint, only the child whose wont was to be so merry, the very life of the house, lay passive and still in Old Reliable's lap, taking no interest in anything about her, and answering their playful efforts to attract her attention with a strangely languid "( Baby's very tired, her is." Selden looked nervous and troubled, bending over the child; Charity kneeling by the little creature started a flitting expression pitifully troubled and weak. If she looks like any it is Selden." Old Reliable's words ringing in her ears; she glanced   HONOR BRKIGHT.        287 with searching eyes from the tiny pale face on Reliable's arm to the anxious one bending over it; the man grew restless and flushed under her gaze, then stood erect. Mrs. Mallory was standing beside the master in earnest conversation. Presently he joined the group. "Reliable, mother thinks I had better go for the doctor." "Let me go, Mark. My horse is below at the door," said Selden, eagerly. "No, no, man, you have already had a long ride in the sun. I never mind the heat." But Selden persisted, leaving the room hastily. There was a grim, suspicious smile on Old Reliable's face. Truly, it had been the manner of a guilty man. When he had gone the master remained standing by the side of the woman. Charity still knelt at her feet, holding one of Birdie's little limp hands in hers, Mrs. Mallory, at a light stand close by, was pouring iced wine into glasses from a decanter a servant had just brought into the room. She paused suddenly, joining the group. Birdie was moaning as if in pain. They stood about her anxiously. -For a little she did not notice any of them, then, looking with sad, wistful eyes at the young girl, her little voice, choked and grieved, said,- "Pretty, Baby wants her mamma, her do." It was strange that only gloom or sadness brought back this dim memory. Tlhe young girl kissed the tiny hand she held, her own heart quivering painfully. The little creature continued, with sorrowful per- sistence,- "Pretty, where is Baby's mamma?" There was a dead silence; not a sound save the restless   288       HONOR BRIGHT. moving of the humpback among his cushions, as though he stirred in his sleep. Again,- "Where is Baby's mamma?" the sweet voice plaintive with smothered sobs, so early do we learn to choke our grief. Mrs. Mallory had drawn close by, and now, her gentle eyes full of tears, said, softly,-- "Mamma is in heaven, Birdie." "Oh!" with that effort to be satisfied with mysteries so pitiful in all, especially so in childhood. The tears rolled fast over Mrs. Mallory's cheeks. An- other silence, full only with the child's, sobs. Reliable broke it. "When did she die"  The tone was incisive and trenchant, and received im- mediate reply, as such tones are wont. ,. "When we brought Birdie home, months ago," hes- itatingly. Again silence, with a rustle at the distant lounge, and the dark, chatoyant eyes of the humpback peering ' toward the group with a sort of fierce anguish. "Who was JBirdie's mamma " A question never absent from the girl's tired mind in all those months, yet when the woman put it in her terse, blunt fashion, she started as if the thought was quite new, turning pale with fright and apprehension. Mrs. Mallory clasped her hands nervously, glancing in a sort of deprecatory way at the master. The woman's keen gray eyes instinctively followed. He was standing with folded arms, looking down at the kneeling girl, who had raised her white eager face to his. "She was my wife / " he said, in-a cold, quiet; tone, that utterly forbade further question. "Humph!" said Reliable, and arose, carrying the sick child up and down the room.   EONfOR BRIGBT.          289 Mrs. Mallory took. a glass of the iced wine to Clare's distant lounge; thus Charity and the master were compar- atively alone. He had taken Reliable's chair; ;she had risen, thus was standing directly beside him. She had suspected him wrongfully, she had doubted, accused and he had done so much for her, had even saved her life. "You have aspersed my  Honor Bright!" The words came back in their cold, hard tone. She did:not so much as glance at him, but turned abruptly, going back to her deserted seat in the window. The master leaned wearily in his chair, resting his proud, immobile face in his hand. The girl could not comprehend. She did not seek to. This man whom    she had doubted, this man whom she loved, was true.  Her heart, so o1ng crushed and fettered by cruel suspicions, threw off its shackles, and leaped into joyous liberty. She said now that she could endure all things, suffer all things, aye, even separation, since she still might love, and know it no crime.

THRXE are. days in our  lives when we  instinctively pause, laying aside all work, all the wonted routine of labor or recreation, and stand mute and idle before the yet drawn veil of our destiny.   290       HONOR BRaIGT. The thought finds occasional expression in that indefi- nite, "Something is going to happen." The objects we have hitherto eagerly sought to attain are forgotten, or seem insufferably tame and worthless. Every other emotion is merged, lost, in expectancy and suspense., Such a day had this been from its very dawning. It seemed as if Selden would never return with the doctor. Birdie's occasional low moans grew continuous. Up and down the long drawing-room Reliable paced, once in her walk passing close beside Clare's lounge, and fastening the keen gray eyes behind their double lenses on him. He grew restless and nervous beyond control, and at each successive moan from the little pale lips would quiver as if in pain. Mrs. Mallorywas flittingin and out the room, listening with tearful eyes to the tiny sufferer, then hur- rying to a hall casement, which commanded full view of the road, to look for the doctor, "Charity!  The word broke the silence in a quick imperative, tone. The woman had sat down. In an instant the girl was at' her side. "Little Birdie was in convulsions!" Charity, by education made familiar with suffering, needed no directions, but went quickly for restoratives. Mrs. Mallory stood helplessly by, wringing her hands, whilst Clare, all unobserved, sat erect, with a look of wild anguish on his beautiful face. The master had hastily left the room, himself to seek the doctor. At the main entrance they met, the three men, and hastened to the drawing-room. The spasm had passed. The little creature lay, white and unconscious, in Reliable's lap, Mrs. Mallory and Charity bending anxiously over her. { *       ,   EONOR BBIGHT.         291 As the physician approached, instinctively they drew back, making way for him.  He bent over the wee sufferer, taking one white limp wrist in his. The fearful suspense of that moment! What would the verdict be? Life or death? "Congestion of the brain, caused by the intense heat. Her parents gave her no constitution, neither powers of resistance. She cannot live." Mrs. Mallory sank ina chair, sobbing bitterly. -Selden, utterly overcome, withdrew to a distant window  to hide his emotion, whilst Old Reliable gave her significant "Humph!" looking curiously at Mark Mallory's stalwart form, and firm, decided countenance. "'Proverbially, children have their constitutions from their fathers," she said, bluntly. The master started. It was a bit of unobserved by-play. The physician was issuing orders, which Charity, calm and self-pos- sessed, was executing. "She would be better in her night-slip, and on a bed," the doctor advised. "Which is the coolest room?" asked Old Reliable. "Mine is--take her there!" The voice was unnatural, and full of terrible anguish. Intuitively each glance was directed from whence it came-the humpback's lounge. He sat erect his beautiful face livid and full of a sort of dumb, half-concealed agony. His mother went hastily to his side. "Iare, dear, you are ill!" He waved her 0ff impatiently. She sighed; then bade them follow, and led the way. All save those three men, the master, Selden and Clare. What link bound those three together?   292       HONOR BRIGHT. Clare had buried his face in the cushions. Nelson yet lingered, partially screened by the drapery of the win- dow, whilst the master paced the floor with folded arms, and proud, stern face, effectually concealing every thought or emotion. Presently, Selden, too, left the room, seek- ing the little sufferer, and the brothers were alone. The younger, with his face hidden, as motionless as if he slept; the elder, continuing that steady tread. Once or twice he paused near the lounge and seemed -about to speak, then turned abruptly, continuing his walk. Presently the doctor entered. He was one of those who had used his utmost skill during the raging of the plague. The master approached to meet him. "I can do nothing more," he said. "Have you other patients requiring your immediate attention?" asked. Mr. Mallory. He thought a moment, then replied,- "No." "Will you do me the favor to remain, then?"  What had prompted the request? The physician bowed acquiescence, then, with profes- sional ease, made himself comfortable, helping himself to a glass of the iced wine, and sitting in the window. Little by little the sun was conquering, until even the shadows of the gray old buildingwere lost in its broad red glare.- The heat grew with fearful intensity. With fierce glory the sun strode up into the meridian, and it was high noon. Lunch was announced. "Charity, love, pray take my place. I cannot go," pleaded Mrs. Mallory, where they watched by the bedside in Clare's magnificent apartments. She went down, accompanied by Selden. Mr. Mallory and the doctor were already seated.   HONOR BRIGHT.         293 She took Mrs. Mallory's place, opposite the master, with her quiet, graceful dignity. Clarets place-was vacant. She glanced, half fearfully, halfquestioningly, at the  master. "Could he have been so cruel as to speak at such a time?"  He read her thought, and answered it coldly,- "Clare seemed still to sleep-we did not disturb him.'" The meal was a silent one, no one eating save the doc- tor. Selden paid no heed to anything passing, only gazed in a sort of stupor at his plate, and presently arose in an abrupt fashion, never begging to be excused, and re- turned to the sick-room. What had so changed the man?  Usually he had fled from suffering with a weak, nervous fright. When the meal was concluded the doctor went with Charity. The master returned to the drawing-room. Death had again sought the haunts so fearfully familiar in those months gone by. A series of terrible convulsions, then, with a touch of childhood's habitual grace, she turned upon her side, drawing up her little knees, and resting her face in her wee hand.: At first they thought she slept, but the death pallor spread.    ' The little grieved heart was at rest forever; glad in the bosom of him who said,- "Of such is the kingdom of Heaven." Mrs. Mallory bowed her head, sobbing bitterly. Charity, her dark eyes full of tears, was aiding Relia- ble in the work grown so familiar in that cruel experience -of-the past, washing the tiny form, perfect as a thing of marble, and bringing the dainty robes. 25*.   294:       HONOR BRIGHT. "Some one should tell the master," said Old Reliable. The doctor stood by with folded arms. Mrs. Mallory caught the words. "Charity, love, will you, I cannot," pleadingly through her sobs and tears. A moment only the girl stood irreso- lute, then left the room. It was strange how the difficult tasks in life all fell to her share. She went slowly, hesi- tatingly, pausing outside the drawing-room door to gather strength. Mr. Mallory was pacing the floor as before, Clare with his face still buried from sight.. She crossed the threshold, and stood motionless. Mr. Mallory saw her, and approached, taking her hand in his. "You have come to tell me something?" he said. "Yes, little Birdie is dead; " the sad, earnest eyes full of tears, the voice very gentle,--then with a cry of hor- ror she sprang past him to the lounge. A moment the humpback had sat erect, straining forward as if to catch her words, then had fallen backward in a swoon. So the long hours passed, and this day, this marked day in their several lives, drew to its close. The sun, with cruel, fierce glory sank in the west, leav- ing its foot-prints of purple and scarlet and gold, far up the sky, their bright reflex laying on mountain, wood, and meadow, The silence of death reigned over this grand old build- ing, whilst the shadowy sunset light stole in between the parted drapery of the wide casements, in rooms and cor- ridors, revealing in its softened hue all their oriental splendor. In the drawing-room, Clare, pale and weak from his late swoon, still lay upon the lounge. He was alone. Above a westward chamber.   EONOR BRIGHT.         295 The. casement opened, the drapery parted wide, and'the last sunbeams gathered there. Beneath the blue and silver canopy of the bed, robed in dainty, fleecy lace, lay a tiny fo6rm, more beautiful, more perfect, than sculptured marble, since it was the perfect workmanship of the great artist. At the foot, one robed in black knelt; at the head, another, cladr in white, with bright head bowed; whilst her gentle hands strewed flowers of most exquisite per- fume about the wee snowy form. Near by stood the master, with folded arms, his proud head bent; his eyes, those light-blue eyes, were dark in their intensity, searching the little still face of the dead child. A feeble tottering step through the marble halls, then suddenly there was another presence by the bedside. In- stinctively every bye was raised, and centered on him. The humpback, with wild dishevelled hair, with face wan, haggard, and full of fierce, white anguish. Beyond all, unnoticed in the doorway, stood Old Relia- ble. For a moment there was a fearful silence, such as Fate always imposes when about to issue one of her dread de- crees. Then one long slender arm was waved with a wild imperative gesture, and he cried, in a voice of mad pas- sion, of fierce, terrible anguish,- . "Away, every one of you! this is my place. Who but the father should watch by his own dead child?" If a thunder-bolt had burst over them, there could not have been a more ghastly, alarm. The kneeling mother raised her face, white, dumb, be- wildered. The maiden drew back, scarce comprehending, yet appalled in the presence of this direful crime; whilst the master, this man of iron, this man of indomitable   296       'HONORS STBR  T. will, of proud composure, was at length bowed, broken, reeling where he stood, and clutching blindly at the head- board for support. The humpback with terrible, un- natural strength, faced him. It is to you the story must be told. You with your strong, finely developed form, I a miserable, deformed humpback; you with your wonderful mind, and indom- itable will, your, powers of resistance, your hatred of sin, your seeming utter destitution of passion; I all impulse, rushing headlong on to every evil; your touch transform- ing everything to gold, mine to lead; I hated you from my very birth, yet you did everything for me. Thus, we grew to manhood. You of unquestioned integrity and unstained honor; I one of the gay boys of the city; at length we loved the same woman / the sister of that brave knight, my amanuensis, Selden," with fierce sarcasm. "You won her, of course, with scarce an effort. , She was your wife. Then you were suddenly called to Eu- rope, land left your bride to the protection of your brother, and hers I Surely she should have been safe!" with a wild demoniac laugh. "She was weak; Iwon the heart she said she had given you from gratitude. Selden, blind fool, never suspected until too late.

You fell readily in my snare, and laid the crime to some of my many gay friends, who, I had taken good care, should fre- quent your mansion in your absence. Qh, the revenge was sweet when I saw you pale and stricken in the midst of all your wealth, vowing that in the moment you knew the villain he was a dead man I You never suspected your own brother I You never sought her, but obtained a divorce, in aquietway, for desertion.

He threw up his arms wildly, and fell to the floor. 'The master, in a blind, groping way, staggered past him, and left the room. The mother, like one struck powerless, never moved; the old woman, for once, seemed utterly helpless, through sheer horror. Would none come to the side of this one stricken low in his sin? A moment's fearfil silence, then the slight figure in its white drapery knelt beside him, the bright head befit over him. Woman, ever nearest God, in her pity, in her mercy. A    low cry of horror brought the others quickly to her side.  The blood was flowing in a rapid stream from the white, parted lips. CHATPER XXVl11. "Tlmannum est errare."

The moon flooding her rambling walls and massive turrets with her yellow light, whilst within, Justice turned coldly from where Mercy knelt with streaming eyes. The blood-stained clothes; the wild dishevelled hair; the beautiful face contorted with the last agony. "In his weakness, in his passion, he had burst a blood vessel." So the physician said. "It was no place for her, they told her, so the girl stole noiselessly from.the room. Whither? Through the many intersecting passages, each and ll utterly deserted, to the far distant picture gallery. It was all unlighted, save by the moonlight which filled it, bringing into full relief each group of statuary, each exquisite painting and rare gem of art. She passed to where each moonbeam seemed focused in a sort of radi- ance divine, like halo emanating from the throne about that picture of the dying Lord. There she knelt. Wrestling for the dead! entreating pardon when the day of grace is past. Such is accounted sin, and the girl's face was pure, peaceful, when she arose. She had left him with the pitying Christ, who, when in his mortal agony, ere Deity yielded to humanity had cried, " Father, forgive them, they know not what they do." And the master. He sat desolate and alone in his library, this man, stricken, smitten with the cruelest wrong one man can do another. In the agony, the despair that had fallen on them, he was forgotten. None had gone to tell him of this fearful retribution, this immediate, sudden judgment. Passing the door a little later, the girl glanced in and saw, him - this noble, strong, true man who had been so wantonly wronged. She had doubted, accused him.   HONOR BRIGHT.           299   She was not fit even to offer comfort. A moment she hesitated, then entered, humbly, penitently; he was sit- ting, his face bowed in his hands, the lamp-light streaming athwart it. He did not hear her; she went quite beside him and laid her hand upon his shoulder. The touch had no power. She spoke his name once, twice, there was no answer. She was alarmed. Her hand with gentle firm- ness took his from his face; he looked at her in a mute bewildered way a moment, then said in a sort of dumb fashion,- "What do you want, Charity?" Her eyes were full of compassionate, entreating tears, "You will forgive him since he is dead," she plead softly. "Dead! Who is dead?" he demanded. "Clare, oh! I thought they had told you," her voice broken and trembling. He arose abruptly and left the room. That night there were many watchers. Where the moonlight gathered about the tiny form, matrons and maiden. Below in the author's study, on the lounge, his wonted resting place, lay a still,( ghastly figure, covered away from sight by a sleet. One on either side. To the left a man kneeling, with weak lips growing strong, with the look of fierce hate, that had of late marred the countenance, vanishing.    To the right, a strong frame bowed, with face buried in his hands. Each striving to forgive, for each had been cruelly wronged. Thus they wrestled and the morning saw them con- querors.  300 -      HONOR BRIGHT. Then three days went by; the customary time for keeping the dead. They lay upon their biers in stately magnificence, with choicest flowers and rarest exotics scattered in profusion about them. The air of the grand old building was heavy with the perfume of Nature's incense. Everywhere were flowers; in the windows; in the niches; in the apartments; and in the corridors, whilst all about was "the outward semblance of the inward woe."  The main entrance had been draped with crape from arch to arch, whilst mingled with its sable folds were festoons of choicest flowers. There was one single omis- sion- the uninitiated thought it an oversight  the grandest arch was wholly undraped, whilst its only flower, a wreath of Immortelles was hung about the place where "Honor Bright" was gilt in its azure ground. It was the work of Old Reliable. Then there was the courtly pomp and magnificence of the funeral.

The young girl on a low chair near her, her: face resting on her hand, and gazing listlessly out at the distant window, whilst in the French window leading out on the veranda, partially screened by the drapery, stood the master, with folded arms, his proud face white and set, as it had been since that terrible revelation. Presently Mrs. Mallory left the room, passing Selden on the threshold. He entered and approached quite to the spot where Charity was sitting. He had changed, this man; the pusillanimous, cow- ardly expression characteristic of him, had given place to a certain strength, that strength, pure 'and noble, which arises from the forgiving of a great wrong. The man had been rebuked. He had seen that Divine justice, which he had been wont to mock at, speedily ad- ministered. The scoffer believed! He stood in silence a moment. -The girl had not no- ticed his entrance; he laid his hand gently upon her shoulders to attract her attention. 26 -     302       HONOR BRIGBT. "Charity, I have something to say to you." "Well?" very kindly,.and motioning him to be seated. He remained standing beside her, and continued, in a confused, excited way,- "It is something that will, perhaps, make you despise me, but I shall feel as if I was gaining your regard under false pretences, did I not make it known." She started a little nervously. He went on in a rapid, impetuous tone, - "That man wronged me, he tarnished my name, took from me the only one left in this world just when, through her marriage, life had grown brightest. I have hated him for years. For the last few weeks he tried to convince me that you had promised to be his wife. At length I be- lieved him, and if he had not died I should have killed him. Now you know all. At heart I was amurderer!" He bowed his head in mingled anguish and remorse. She took his hand in the gentle, helpful way peculiar to woman. . He went on, very humbly, - "I forgive him now as I hope Godto forgive me." Then continued,- "It was yet a crueler wrong to the master. - In guard- ing the secret, I sinned. I did it for his poor mother's sake. Now for him I foretell a bright and happy life. They are all dead - you love him." The girl paled and flushed painfully, glancing at the distant window. Had the master heard, so quiet, so passive was he, like a statue? Selden did not notice this third presence, but went on rapidly, - "If it had been possible for you to have loved me, I would have gladly yielded that love, dearer than my life, to him, and thought it no more than recompense for the suffering he has received of me and mine."   HONOR BRIGHT.          303 His lips were quivering, his eyes full of tears. Unable to control himself, he turned quickly and left the room, the girl immediately following him. Some hours later they, were again in the drawing-room. Mrs I Mallory seated upon the lounge, the master, with that boyish grace peculiar to him, on a low stool at her feet, and, at a little distance, Charity. There had been a thunder-storm, and now the rain, cool and refreshing after the terrible heat, was falling in torrents. A musical clock, from a distant apartment, sang nine. Charity arose to say "good night." Mrs. Mallory called her back in a voice of gentle entreaty,- "Do not go, love! There are only three of us left- we should cling together now. Come, dear," holding out her hand for her. She approached, a trifle hesitatingly; judgingfrom her own self-reliant nature, she, had thought they would rather have been alone in their trouble. Mrs. Mallory drew her down beside her on the lounge. There was a dash of color in the girl's fair face, for now the master was quite as directly at her feet as at his mother's. He did not even so much as glance at her, his face still the thing of marble it had been for days. - He had laid his head on his mother's lap, so his face was quite before the girl. She could not fail but see it, and in seeing watch. No one had offered sympathy; he had stood alone in his strength, his cold face showing no  sign of the inward struggle, save its extreme pallor and   set expression. Mrs. Mallory was running her fingers caressingly through his short crisp curls, every little while, at some sudden   304         HObNOR BRIGHT. memory, stopping to wipe the fresh gathered tears. So an hour passed. Again the girl made a move to go, saying,- "I will bid you good-night." Mrs. Mallory put her arm around her and kissed her, then detaining her, said gently,- - Kiss Mark, too, love. You seem   so much like my daughter, I really think you are; and surely a sister should kiss her own brother, good-night," with a little coaxing smile. The fair cheeks paled and flushed in painful succession, whilst for the first time in all that evening, Mr.-Mallory looked at her, his quiet, blue eyes half questioning, half waiting, and seemingly quite indifferent as to the result of her struggle. His coldness piqued, angered her. She copld kiss him as a sister, he should see it. So she bent her head with a certain tinge of hauteur, and touched his broad, fine brow with her lips, then, arising, said "good-night," with quiet self-possession and left the room. So a month passed, and every evening, with little variety, was a repetition of this. CHAPTER XXIX. O'er the silence, unseen, The footsteps of sentinel angels, between The dark land and deep sky were moving.

It was a Sabbath in the early fall; the sun was setting amidst clouds of purple and crimson, and gold, piled high up the western sky; the Sabbath stillness rested over all. i -J      '    HONOR BRIGHT.         '305 The mountains far towering heavenward; the woods bril- liant with Autumn's thousand dyes; the meadows with their endless variety of shading; and the gray old turreted building clinging to the very edge of the precipitous bluff. Within its massive walls a certain sadness reigned, for on the morrow its lord and master left home for his long projected European tour.  Selden, whose health was greatly shattered, was to accompany him. Every arrangement had been made for the comfort of those left behind. Mr. Hammond was to take charge of the building during his absence. Mrs. Mallory had at first rebelled most bitterly, but at length yielded to that will, which when exerted toward her was so very winsome, and had even tried to reconcile herself to it by saying, "Mark needs a change - I should be willing." A Surely the man needed something, for in that month he had seemed to grow ten years older and reticent almost to asceticism. He seemed to have wholly drawn within himself, to be as far removed from them all as if the sea already divided them. In that month, Charity too had grown wan and pale; the fine strong face disclosing continual struggle and effort for control, with tense lines about the lips and sad wistful eyes. So pride stood grim and forbidding between this man and woman, thrusting their love mockingly aside and calling them brother and sister. As we said, it was a Sabbath evening; the ringing of the church bells was wafted in through the open casements; Mrs. Mallory and Selden had driven into the distant town to church; Charity was alone on the veranda we have so often mentioned, with the beauty and the holy stillness all about her, everything telling of peace, save her own troubled face. 26*   8OU     .  HONOR BRIGHT. Suddenly pouring through corridor, apartment, and out at the open windows, were the grand notes of the organ, in the majestic strains of an oratorio. Perhaps never again would the air be filled with its glory and sweetness. She was listening with white face bowed in her hands; the notes now swelling in great bursts of rapturous praise, now sinking into sweetest cadence. Suddenly she arose with an expression of fixed purpose and strong determination, through the corridors, across the grand domed hall to the music room. He did not hear lier, until she stood quite beside him, brought full in view by the flash of light which streamed from the pendant lamp. He did not stop playing at once, but watched her. The slight graceful figure in its black drapery, the fair face with the traces of suffering so palpable now; the shapely head with its wealth of bright waving. hair. His cool critical eyes took it all in and could find no fault, and gazed on as if striving to make the picture distinct and lasting, on the retina of- his mind. She was utterly unconscious of the gaze, leaning against the organ and watching the hands glide over the notes. At length they grew still; she glanced at him and met his eyes quiet and questioning. "I have come to speak to you," she said, confusedly. He waited. There was a moments silence then. "Mr. Mallory, are you going away to-morrow?" "Yes," coldly. '"How long will you be gone?" The voice painfully still and composed. "A year, perhaps two," with apparent indifference.' She turned quickly away so he should not see her face. Going over to a distant casement, and drawing the dra- pery, looked out at the night.   HONOR BRIGHT.         307 The twilight had deepened, and the moon was up. In its ambient light she could plainly see each distinct fea- ture of the strongly marked landscape. The window was open, and the autumn air was damp and penetrating; she shivered; from his distant stool he saw it, and came over closing the casement, then stood quite beside her, thus bringing her face full in view again. It was deathly pale with grieved, tense lines and firm set lips; the dark eyes peering persistently past him out into the night. Suddenly they came full to his face "Mr. Mallory must you go?" her voice still to passive- ness through very excess. "I have never known the meaning of that word must," was the haughty reply. She paid no heed to the tone, but laid her hand plead- ingly on his arm. 7' Will you not stay?" "Wly do you wish it? Is it for my mother's sake? or have you some thought that you even may miss me slightly?" with inimitable sarcasm. His arms were folded, he was regarding her with his proud, immobile face; the hand upon his arm was full of entreaty. "O1l! you know it is for neither," impetuously. e May I inquire what then is your reason?" He was cruel, with the white pitiful face looking up in his. , "Because, because, it will be utterly desolate without you," passionately. Was the man made of iron? "Doubtless you will miss me at first, but your stoical nature will enable you readily to sustain the loss, it being simply a negative one," with withering irony. She drew her hand hastily away, saying, with a sort of angry impetuosity,- ! . .       .   4b v,   308       HONOR BRIGHT. C You intend staying two years, until my time is expired; you need not have troubled yourself so greatly. Sir, I would be glad to leave this moment." -A slight change flitted over his face. "This place is hateful to you; I do not wonder," he said. "Hateful to me!" with poignant sarcasm. c You know better. You purposely misinterpret everything I say. This place has always been my home; no place on earth could ever be one-half so dear." "Why speak of leaving it, then?" quietly. She turned from him, impatiently, not condescending to reply. He continued, in that cold, indifferent tone,- "There will be no one to trouble you; you will be happy with my mother." "Happy!" sarcastically. "' Why not?" looking at her. The blood rushed to her brow, then died, leaving her pale as death. She struggled fiercely. He saw it, this man, but gave no aid. Pride, coldness, reserve, striving with love. It conquered--the master passion. She turned her face full upon him, saying, passionately, - "Vhy? Because you dash the cup of happiness with cruel, relentless hand from my lips, then hbid me drink I! You are unforgiving, remorseless! I wronged you once; for that I must forever suffer, and now, with' heartless triumph, you fling back my love in imy teeth!" He started, turning a sliade paler, and looking at her searchingly. Who but this woman with her strong, true nature would have dared tell her love? His arms still folded, his proud immobile face conceal- ing every thought.   HONVOS BRIGHT.         309 "Why should I believe that you love me?" he said, coolly. "I have told you," almost under her breath, and flushing painfully. "Yes, I admit that, but, understanding you as I do and knowing your spirit of self-abnegation, how should I be able to tell, was this love or gratitude?" in the tone of clear, trenchant reasoning; then adding, angrily, "I'll not brook to be an altar of continual sacrifice / " She clung to him, both hands on the folded arms. "Oh, how can I make you believe it? Put me to some hard, cruel test! Let me prove it!" pleading with the passionate entreaty of one imploring his life. "A love that has to be proved is no love at all," freezingly. The fair face was full of despair. She said, in a tone of utter hopelessness, - "Oh, I cannot make you believe." ' No woman who loved a man could kiss him night after night with sister lips," he said, coldly. Suddenly a thought flashed across her mind. The blood rushed to herbrow. A moment she hesitated, then with firm gentle hands she parted his folded arms, and throwiLng one arm  up around his neck, drew herself to his breast, whilst with the other she made him bend his proud head, and raising her face, flushed and beautiful with hope, she pressed her lips, soft, warm, trembling, to his. Not the cold, quick kiss she had left upon his brow every night for a month, but long, lingering, yielding; then starting back, she buried her blushing, conscious face in her hands. She had shown her trust, pleaded for the love once re- jected. So brave, so true! He folded her close to his   310        ofOR BRIGHT. bosom, whilst he stooped and kissed brow and cheeks and *lips, then held her off and looked at her. The lashes lay dark and heavy on her flushed cheeks. Yet, even yet, though love spoke in every lineament, he was not satisfied.  "Charity, I was deceived once; I have no faith. How can I know that even though you may love me now, you will always?" coldly. She looked into his dreary, unbelieving eyes, her own so full of faith and trust. "Love is immortal," confidently. "Si qua est,'" he replied, with a bitter curve of the lip. She clung to him pleadingly, saying, with passionate vehemence,-- "Oh, do not tell me that you doubt! I would as soon discredit my own being as question that this love should not compass all eternity! It cannot die, since it is a part of my life!") The man seemed partly convinced. "Charity, look at me," he said. Her eyes met his, at first in frank earnestness, then, meeting his deep, passionate love, the lids drooped, veiling the heart, as woman is wont. He smiled, still holding her off to look at her. Then a moment's silence, the fair face flushing painfully, and seeking to hide itself in vain. "Charity, you gave me permission to test your love," in his quiet tone of assertion. A quick, questioning glance. "The test will show my infinite selfishness," with a little, bitter smile. Then continuing,- "If you yield willingly, without fear' or hesitancy, I will believe and trust." 7 ,    HONOR BRIGHT          3" Then another silence, her face full of suspense. "My darling, if you love me, you will be my wife to- morrow." As he spoke he released her, making her bear the trial, prove her love, utterly unaided. She stood paling and flushing. Give up girlhood! A wife! iHis wife! In a few short hours! His wife, whose arms she had never sought until to-night-! So soon her constant shield  Give her life to him! It was infinitely selfish. His light-blue eyes, almost black in their intensity, were fastened on her.. She loved him, it was enough. She came back into his arms, and laying her face trust- fully in his bosom, said,-  "I will be your wife to-morrow." You should have seen the change come over the man. 'The immobile face was all alight, fairly flooded. He stooped his proud head to hers, and blessed and thanked her, even humbly, speaking her name in its broader, fuller significance, c Charity,-Love." A   few hours later, the silence of sleep reigned. In the grand apartments, through the marble corridors, everywhere, the-still aie seemed to say that peace had at length folded her bright wings within those massive walls. A chamber door was softly opened; the young girl stole noiselessly through the long intersecting corridors, to where a  door stoodslightlyajar. She opened it gently and entered. On the floor, her gaunt arms folded around her knees, the double glasses on her nose, sat Old Reliable. She did not hear the girl until she stood quite beside her and laid her hand upon the angular shoulder; then     312       HONOR BBIGHT. looked up quickly. The face above her, so beautiful in its new found joy, she needed no double lenses to see it. "Tell me, child " in her blunt, abrupt fashion. The voice that replied was full of a proud joy. "Reliable. God willing, to-morrow I shall be Mr. Mal- lory's wife!" The woman spoke not a word, but clasped her hands and, raising her wrinkled face, breathed a silent thanks- giving to God; whilst the young girl bowed her bright head, her own heart sending up a glad pseon. The moonlight streamed in through the glass ceiling of the picture gallery, gathering 'in a golden halo about the picture of our blessed Lord. The grand domed hall, too, was full to overflow, its radiance bright with a tinted glory from the stained glass over the main entrance, its rays seeming focused about that spot where, with the wreath of Immortelles about it, "Honor Bright" was gilt on its azure ground.
