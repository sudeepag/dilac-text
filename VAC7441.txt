CHAPTER I IN looking back upon the Past, as upon the sky which is- flecked with clouds, where the stars shine dimly, Love and Sorrow rekindle the fire, and weep afresh upon the altar of my heart. There is one scene, pure and bright, which lives alone--alone survives the conflicts of despair and hope-the lights- of morning and the evening shadows. A small white cottage in a lonely place, small and unassuming, is a distinct fea- ture in the landscape. It was neatly kept during my mother's lifetime-even the little walk from the gate to the door was each day freshy graveled, and whatever was wanting in luxury or display was supplied by com- fort, and the soft atmosphere of lover and kindness, floating over our young hearts and brows with mellow-, ing and delightful influence. -Halcyon hours! blissful abode! be mine again! Come out of the mists and tempests which have shadowed but can never despoil your innocent loveliness. I invoke the forms of those early years, long slumbering, long lost, to'pass before my yearning eyes! The image of a young and beauti- ful: woman adorns the panorama, dressed in white, as I saw her last, pale and still, holding her child in a close   2         -LILLIAN: OR, embrace, with the mute but touching appeal of undy- ing love; her last gaze rested on me-on me, a child too; her last words were, "Keep her, love her, for my sake," and the voice died forever. Then came my father's grief; then came-but I anticipate! There is a little hand clasped in mine-going on--on with. me in the great struggle of life; a soft and lovely face, the image of her mother, looking into mine-but to the Past! God help those who have only the Past! they have it not! God help us all! The heroine of the following narrative shall be to me as a friend-not as myself--another!..... In the bright tints that prelude the morning there is a garden, sleeping with the dew, sleeping in a thou- sand prismatic colors; awake with the lark; exhaling perfume like incense to the soft sigh of the zephyr ' every leaf and flower nod gracefully to the sun, as he opens the court of day-the tears of night ascend in a mysterious cloud, mingled with her light breath of fra- grance, up, up to the Eternal Throne; voices and in- cense, the worship of nature, continually arise. A light and graceful form flits even at that sunrise hour among the flowers and shrubbery of the small but lux- uriant garden. Now she bends over a rose bush, pluck- ing spray after spray of the delicate and lovely blos- soms, talking to them in her soft, childlike way. And she is a child, in whose irregular features and dark, colorless complexion there is the shadow of a great and early grief; her only beauty consists in the dark but soft and melancholy gray eye, now filled with tears, now lighted with enthusiasm, or kindled with high and firm resolves. This is Lillian, the American twer girl. When the little basket is filled with a choice anda    THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       8 profuse collection, presenting every shade and variety, they are soon tastefully and artistically arranged. "This bouquet," said she, holding up a perfect gem, still sparkling with dew, "is worth at least twenty-five cents; this one will bring fifteen--but I must take whatever I can get," added she with a sigh, " and I hope some one will purchase all;- there is everything to buy, and father has forgotten it. These buds of the carnation and white roses will be out to-morrow; they would be lovely for a bride-such an one as my mother must have been. But the sun is rising higher-higher- and may be I shall be gone all the morning; poor little Eva will miss me sadly. She is sleeping yet, and I will not go back to wake her.", With a light and rapid step she descended the stairs, and passing through the little gate, threaded her way to the city, already alive with bustle and excitement. The day was without a cloud, but care sat on her young brow and heart like an incubus. Holding her treasures closely, lest the sun should shine on them, or the moomE ing zephyr despoil their delicate beauty; no one re- garded her, not even with a glance; in her plain and unpretending but cleanly dress she was not an object to attract attention. A young girl passed her hurriedly; a moment Lillian stood still, then turned and followed her.  "Miss," said she, in an earnest but timid voice, a will you buy some flowers?" "They are beautiful," was the reply; "but I can not take them to-day, my child," and she resumed her way.? G It was the first disappointment of the morning, d alf .fell on her spirits like ice. Had she known how . t!to young heart was yearning like her own for love ,i   4         LILLIAN: OR, and sympathy, for sunshine and flowers, she would have pitied, not reproached her. The poor girl was on her way to the scene of daily labor and lonely toil, and that for a small and scanty subsistence. But the tire- less hands of woman must accomplish their task. The reward on earth is small, but the poor may be rich in fadeless and eternal treasure. A tall and stately man -approached. The bouquet was taken from its concealment and held up to his gaze-"Please buy, sir?"  Not even a pleasant-word or glance rewarded her. Tears gathered in her eyes, but she wiped them away-young, yet learning the world's first and great lesson, concealment. Poor little Lillian, she could not imagine the unhappy domestic scene in the dwelling of that proud and wealthy aristo- crat-once, he would have bought those truly beautiful flowers for his bride-now, she was only an unloved - wife, brilliant in society and admired by others, but holding no place in his heart. A group of laughing school girls approached. "Oh!" they all exclaimed, "what charming flowers! Come here, let us see them." Obeying the mandate, she drew near. Bouquet after bouquet was examined, then thrown carelessly, even rudely, down, and Lillian dared not expostulate, hoping till that they wotld take one or all. I will have this," said a tall, rude girl, with a wicked twinkle in her eye, " and pay you to-morrow, sis! "But I want the money to-day, Miss!. ' a "Oh, ho! so you- are afraid to trust me! ' Gil threw it down so violently that the rose petalstew S every direction, and the'chief ornament of the dlust'er   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       5 was broken and destroyed. Lillian could not restrain her tears. "Oh, you have broken my rose, my sweet, beautiful rose."  "Learn, then, to be more civil. Come, girls, let us go, or we shall be late at school." There was one who lingered behind, a frail, lovely creature, looking the pity and sympathy which 'she truly felt. "What is your name?" said she to Lillian. The reply was faint and tremulous. "Well, Lillian, I am sorry your bouquet is spoiled; and I have no money or I would pay you for it; but here is a picture book; perhaps you would like this. Do not weep any more; you will find it very pretty and entertaining;" and she bounded away- after her- retreating companions. Lillian dried her eyes and opened the book; it con- tained many bright and attractive pictures. "This will please Eva," said she, "but it is not money--money," she repeated  emphatically. "Will no one buy my flowers?" and the tears flowed afresh. Seating herself on the curbstone under a large shade- tree, she wept long and bitterly. A carriage rolled by over the paved street; it stopped, and a lady bending forward, beckoned the little flower girlfto approach. "Your flowers are faded, my child; but why are you weeping?" Lillian- raised her eyes and met the earnest gaze fi:ed:upon her. It was a kindly gazeand encouraged  $-QtI- ::n:m weeping, madam, because-because I must ::/ sell my flowers, and no one will buy; I am weeping, '"-   ri6        LMLIA : OR, because I feel desolate and alone in the great city, There is no one to take care of my little sister until I return." "Have you no father or mother?" "My mother died in the spring, and my father has no employment." Her voice faltered. There was a long pause, while they remained face to face, looking in each other's eyes--that timid, little girl, that rich and happy lady. An electric chord was touched by the Master hand, that vibrated in the bosom of each- the chord of Destiny. "I will take your flowers; and to-morrow bring as many as you can procure to the Church of the Mes- siah. Be there at half-past nine o'clock." Full of joy and wonderment, the flower girl seized the glittering coin which was dropped into the basket, and uttered, though inaudibly, deep words of thankful- ness. A heavenly smile irradiated her careworn face, rendering it peculiar in interest and expression. Al- most dropping upon her knees, as the carriage rolled by, she raised her eyes to heaven in gratitude, which she had been taught was due to the Giver of every good and perfect gift. Lillian was totally ignorant of the value of the coin, and intent only on purchasing necessary food for her sister and herself, she ran swiftly down the street. The man, however, of whom she made her purchases, happened to be honest; her basket was, therefore, well filled, and money still remaining. The business of the morning being completed, she hastened home. Eva was sitting in the door, playing with the few toys which' her thoughtful sister had left within her reach. Ea- t ' gerly she extended her arms, and Lillian, disincumbered   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       7 of the basket, whose weight she had not felt before, re' plied fondly to her loving welcome.   n "My darling, now we will have breakfast," said she, joyfully. After the repast was ended, the flower girl reopened her treasures, and taking out the picture book, placed it in the little hand, assured that it would furnish enjoyment for many weary hours. "It must be noon," said she, 4 and papa will come home; perhaps he has found work, and I must make everything tidy." So she glided about warbling sweetly, till she could find no more to do. -But noon came and passed. They walked through the garden, those soli- tary children; the birds sang to them, and everything seemed instinct with life and happiness. Insects in the grass and streams in the woodland, while in the arbor overhung with grapevines, they played till sunset. Lillian would pause at times and look earnestly down the street, from whence she expected her father's re- turn. At last she heard his well-known step, and saw him coming slowly up the graveled walk. With a cry of joy she ran to meet him, but he lifted her sadly in his arms, and kissed her. Carrying the little Eva, and holding Lillian by the hand, they went into the cot- tage. "Father, I have prepared a nice tea for you. Come, let us eat. It has been so lonely here all day!" "But where did you get this?" said he, in surprise, as she covered the board with the delicacies which she had purchased. "It is for a surprise, papa; is it not pleasant?" But the father did not partake; silently he listened to the story of his daughter's good fortune-his brow contracting and relaxing, smiling and frowning alters   8         LTATT AN: OR,            - nately; striving in vain to conceal the deep emotions of his soul.                       "Come, Lillian, my child, and sit beside me. I wish to tell you something, which I fear you- can not un- derstand."             "What is it, dear papa? Any new trouble?" He looked at her strangely. "Trouble, Lillian, what : can one so young and innocent know of trouble?" "I knew it first at my mother's grave. I have known ! it since every day." The man arose, and wiping his eyes, paced the floor with an agitated step. * "Lillian," said he, pausing before her, "Lillian, I have sought employment vainly. There has been a strike among the workmen for higher wages, and all are now regarded with suspicion, having been discharged by their former employer. There is only one resource remaining, and that is-to join the army!" "Oh, father!" and Lillian uttered a low and mourn- ful cry, "how can we live without you? No one to love us--no one even to care for us! When you are here, something of the old atmosphere of home lingers ! in the cottage-then, it will be desolate!"        X "My daughter, I will make every provision for your comfort. If you choose to remain here, there is a trusty, faithful and kind-hearted woman, who will cher- i ish you both for my sake."'  "Oh, do not go, do not go," said she, throwing her arms about his neck, and sobbing violently. He took her in his arms lovingly, smoothed her hair, speaking gently and cheerfully.  "My little Lillian must not forget that. she is now my only dependence. To her has been entrusted the    :   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       9 care of Eva; the time will swiftly pass, and I shall come home with many nice things for my darlings. Will you be patient? Will you be firm? Will you re- member your mother's dying words?" "I do. I have. I can never forget them! But it will be so lonely without you-no father, no mother-- how can I think of it!" "You need not think of it. Every day will bring new duties; and I wish you to learn a great deal. There are many, many things, my darling," said he, parting her wavy hair and gazing on her thoughtful brow; "you will love to learn, that I may feel proud of you; that you may teach your little sister." "I will try, papa-but you may never come back. Do not go away." "My child," he replied, impressively, "God is over all. Does He not hear the ravens when they cry? Love Him, pray to Him, serve Him, and the reward will come." And Lillian nestled closely to his bosom. "Papa, what is death?  It is-fearful--so cold and still! It is not at all like sleep. The thought fills me with terror of the cold earth-of the silent valley-the vacant place which can not be supplied. Mamma will never come to us again, and it seems cruel and unjust to take her away forever!" "Hush, my child; your mother is very happy; she lives with God and the angels in such a bright and beautiful home!  She never weeps, as we must; she never sighs as we do, but wears a crown and strikes a golden harp in the presence of the great King!" Lillian raised her eyes, as if she could see the bright image he had depicted; as if she could hear the music of the hteavenly choir.   10       T JLTTjTAN: OR "Let us go, too, father," said she, solemnly, "let s go!" "In His time, my child; we are on the way; but re- member, child, there are two paths, which lead to two abodes; the path of virtue is the only path of peace. Oh, may you be preserved in innocent goodness, my child! Be like your mother, it will be well! but go now, your little sister is calling you." Quickly obeying, she raised Eva in her arms and carried her to their own quiet room; she sung her to sleep, and laid her down tenderly as a mother, then re- turned to the window, where she could muse in the soft light of that glorious summer evening. Slowly, one by one, the sunset tints died from the heaven; the bird sought his nest; all was shadowy and mysterious- the trees sighed to the stars, and the stars looked down upon them and all the world with silent glances. Every flower was folded up. She watched the clouds and fancied many shapes and scenes in that far-off sea of azure. The day's events passed in review before her. The despondency which attended her early efforts to sell bouquets-the lovely little creature who had offered her sympathy, the beautiful lady, and her appointment on the morrow. Last of all came the thought of her father's departure-the long, sad, weary days which would follow, when the flowers were gone-when the snow came and fell upon her garden and upon her mo- ther's grave. The moon rose in the heaven higher and higher, till it rested over the church spire-that church she had been taught to love-it was now silvered in the soft light, and from thence she could hear continu- ally those words of blessed consolation sounding in her ears, a I am the Resurrection and the Life! i   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      1] CHAPTER II. THE carriage containing the noble and accomplished Mars. Carroll, who had spoken so kindly to Lillian, who had shed a ray of sunshine on the troubled life of the little flower girl, rolled onward to its destination. The morning air was so sweet and exhilarating that it filled her soul. with kindly impulses. To the heart which has never been warped by the cold selfishness of the world, the light and beauty of nature create a correspondent radiance. Everything tends to the formation of char- acter in the child; the scenery of his early home, be it wild or mountainous, level or undulating, every fea- ture stamps itself on the heart and memory inefface- ably. The pure and innocent life of Mrs. Carroll, un- like that of others in the same high and worldly posi- tion, had been devoid of artifice-ennobled by virtuous and charitable deeds. But the placidity of her temper and life had not descended to her only daughter, Flor- ence. Undersuch holy teachings and gentle influences, she was still artful and intriguing. Her beauty was of no ordinary stamp, enhanced by a proud and noble bearing, while the deep vail drawn over her inner life iequired some master hand to rend it asunder; bit this had never been done! To the fashionable wo;ld she was an idol. The jealous still sought her society be- cause she was the reigning star. What wonder, then, if her beauty and position attracted many admirers! There was only one whom she regarded with the sem- blance of love, and had partially plighted to him her   12        TTLT,TAN: OR, faith! But now the tie was to be severed, and by her own act. On the morrow she would be wedded to the proudest and most wealthy aristocrat of the land. Con- gratulating herself upon her brilliant success, and ela- ted with the world's favors, she stood upon the evening of that day, so memorable to Lillian, and previous to the bridal, beside the one whom she had deeply wrong- ed, and who was still in ignorance of the approaching crisis. Hermann Travers was an orphan; his parents dying left him no legacy but that of unblemished in- tegrity and virtue, a legacy of mental and moral worth, far above the golden possessions which take wings and fly away. She was unworthy of him, but if he loved ardently he trusted implicitly. No thought of her base and wicked designs flashed across his mind; the truth was withheld from him to the very last, only to strike deeper and penetrate more fiercely into his soul. "Florence," said he, low and earnestly, in a voice that embodied every emotion, "I am weary of your long delay and instability of resolution! Surely, surely, if you love me, you would not mock me thus! These three years past, I have been striving to obtainoa home befitting my bride. Fortune has smiled upon me; I am not rich, only in your love; but energy and untir- ing ambition shall crown us with success. With your hand clasped in mine, your soul linked to mine, I can bear all hardships, overcome all obstacles. You know well that your parents will deny you no request. Again, I say, I am weary of delay!" Florence could not meet his searching gaze; her eye fell beneath his, and her cheek grew pale as death. "There is something wrong," he exclaimed "you   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      13 have ceased to love me; tell me this; tell me the truth!" And cold as was her nature, she shrank from the task imposed by her own wickedness. "Keep me no longer in suspense! Do you love me or do you not? Will you wed me, or will-younot-'--- He held his breath in pale and silent expectation. "Hermann," she said at last, slowly and painfully, "the truth must come-I have deceived you!" "You are trifling with my feelings still," he cried fiercely, " beware, Florence Carroll; the gentlest influ- ences are the most powerful when once awakened; the breeze may swell to the whirlwind; the placid ripple to the overwhelming billow. There are undercurrents in every heart which, conflicting, make the maelstrom; the elements of destruction. If you tell me I have been the dupe of a cold and heartless woman, it will drive me to frenzy. All this time, perchance, you have never loved me, have smiled and spoken tender words, and I have believed you, fool that I am!" He paused and regarded her with a fixed and burning gaze. Let me read your soul! impenetrable, unloving, un- lovely! Would- that I had never seen you!" he spoke rapidly and vehemently. "Had you not re- warded my love, my dawning affection, with a ready confidence, I could have subdued this kindling fire,; but now it will burn my soul to ashes!" He paused and covered his face with his hands, while Florence sat still and white as a statue. At length he arose and crossed the floor till he stood opposite her. "Forgive me," said he sadly; "I have wronged you. in my anger. Forgive me! (he took her hand and sat down beside her). You do not, you can notknow how this love is in-   "        LILLIAN: OR, twined with my being; how I have cherished it all this time; and now--and now--say that you were jesting- that you once loved me-that you love me still, and will be mine." Florence had recovered her composure. Though it should break her-heart, all emotion must be concealed. "Love," she replied scornfully, "'what is love? Poets sing of it, romances abound in it; but does it live? does it exist free from sordid motives? It is but the fancy of a day, a week-never of a lifetime. You and I must be friends; that is all!" ' You have spoken, I believe, Florence Carroll, your true but unwomanly sentiments. The vail that has shrouded your soul is rent in twain. The spirits of purity and peace, of loving innocence and blessed deeds, can no longer abide in the temple. You have blighted - my hopes; you have darkened my present existence;  s and, for the rest, may God reward you!" "How dare you talk thus to me?" said she, striv-  ing to hide her feelings under an assumption of of- fended dignity; "are not our paths divergent? What can raise a man from obscurity and a lowly rank? Can the worship of a distant star? He is bold, who  aspires to wealth and station, and can not bestow an : equivalent."  "Still deeper do I see your soul, and the sin which  pollutes it. Your arrows glance aside, having missed  their mark. Know, vain and foolish girl, you have   thrown away a gem, perchance to accept the counter- feit. When folly and ambition enter the soul, it be- i comes blind to real worth! But, say, did you never  X love me? Have you won my heart to trample on it?  I Do you exult in the torture of one who has lavished his *    THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       15 affections on you unsparingly? You do not reply- you can not to my earnest questionings! Now, for the last time, I bid you declare my fate!" "Let me, then, proceed without interruption! Her- mann Travers, when I first saw you, I was but a girl, and imagined that a passing fancymust be love, but youthful impressions are readily effaced, and now I dis- cover my mistake; to-morrow I shall be married to one who is my equal in wealth and rank. H bid you to the wedding, in the Church of the Messiah, at half-past nine o'clock, to-morrow morning!" He staggered beneath the blow!   With his head bowed upon his hands, he remained speechless-im- movable.  At last he had gained the control for which he was struggling, and raising himself proudly, stood before her in his native dignity. "Florence Carroll! I  have learned the lesson; it shall not be lost! Remember, when next my name. reaches you, it shall be with the trumpet blast/! on the winds of heaven! it shall meet you everywhere! Then, perhaps, the fire will scathe your own soul! Remem- ber, too, you had not the power to blight my life' dearly, deeply as I have loved you-it is past! The youthful dream is over, and forever! I have learned from this to look deeper--to watch and wait; consider! ing closely if it be the soul's beauty shining in the face -to beware of deception! :Henceforth I  shall shape my destiny by a   higher star-wealth and love and peace shall be mine at last!"And   Waving his hand with a  stately grace, the door closed between them. Every sound :died away with the echoes of his re- treating footsteps. Florence had conquered all tender emotion, true to the instinct of vanity and pride, arose, 2   1f        TsTTAN: OR, and placing herself before a mirror, smiled in proud disdain. "Florence Carroll, the beautiful and accomplished heiress, wedded to the unknown Hermann Travers! But he is noble, even in obscurity?" said she sadly; "and were the rich and proud man whom to-morrow I shall call husband, like him, my cup of happiness would be full. What matter it if he be old and disagreeable? Perhaps his life will be shorter! I do not know, how- ever; disagreeable people always live the longest! My only hope is, that his sojourn will be shorter than he anticipates! Oh, my heart and eyes are weary; I must sleep, or the bridal party will await my coming vainly in the morning!" No remorse preyed upon her soul that night; she slept and dreamed of the splendid bridal. No pang for the sorrow she had caused; for the blighted life; for the young heart throbbing wildly, fiercely-struggling for mastery; not yielding to despair, but hoping, hop- ing still to carve a better and a higher destiny for him- self. It was the awakening of new impulses and re- solves; but we can not tell what these tempests work upon our lives and destinies; they sweep away the lightness and frivolities of youth; they open the door of a new existence, purifying the atmosphere, and clearing the way to an exalted future. At that same time illian slept beside her sister, but peacefully, not- withstanding all her care and grief. With the first rays of the morning sun she was awake, and remem- bering heir appointment, sprang lightly out of bed, and murmuring a hymn which had been taught to her in infancy, was soon attired in her unassuming dress. "I am so glad," she soliloquized, "that it is bright   THE BATTL OF LIFE.       17 this morning; my rosebuds will be out in their beauty and pansies without number. I wonder what she will, do with them; and at the church too? Well, that is a long way off, so I must hasten and prepare breakfast for Eva, when she wakens; perhaps I can bring her good news again to-day, and something pleasant for papa." There are very many others like Lillian, panting for unattainable hights, for fame, and love and affl- uence; for all that earth and heaven can bestow, forgetting that life is a great struggle for a future good. Before her mother died, she had instructed her in many truths which still left her in the dark. She was then twelve years old, and her sister four. That morning she found her father down before her, at work in the little garden, which, for the past season, had been prolific to them of great gain. A new variety of rose had that morning opened. He watched his daugh- ter silently and affectionately as she glided among the flowers; now hidden by the shrubbery; now bending. down over some cherished blossom. "I will await your return, my daughter," said he, and following her to the gate, watched her retreating figure sadly. "Poor child! poor child! every one seems to desert us; every thing seems to be wrong; but, somewhere, far away, there must be recompense, equalization 1. The Church of the Messiah was situated in the most populous part of the city. It was an imposing edifice, built of dark gray stone. Lillian, on her -way thither, had to pass a public park, which, in that delicious hour of the morning, was alive with gayety and excitement. Groups of children in costly attire were there attended   18         T TUTTAN: O0, by their nurses; a band of music filled the air with its delightful harmony; every note thrilled the soul of the flower girl with new and undefined emotions; now car- ried to that heaven, the ideal of her dreams; now weeping, trembling at each mournful cadence. But, awaking from that brief but delightful transport, the little enthusiast was again recalled to earth. "Oh, my roses X the sun has already touched these white buds, and they look drooping." Throngs of people passed her; carriages rolled by, all hastening to the same destination. Upon reaching the gate, Lillian drew back in timid fear; there was no familiar face, and her benefactress nowhere to be seen. "I shall not sell my flowers if I linger here." So, taking courage, she entered, and placing herself in a niche, behind a pillar, she could observe without being observed. Every one seemed expecting some great oc- currence, and Lillian could not avoid hearing the re- marks which fell from the fashionable and gaily dressed assembly. "How could she," said one, " marry a man so much older than herself-so unprepossessing?" "Gold! gold! ' was the reply; " ambition and av- arice have lost many a soul!" "Oh, fie! what matters it," said another, " if she has obtained wealth, rank and influence, which can bring the world to one's feet? Life is valueless without them!  All these things were pondered in her mind. Of whom  were they speaking?  What was about to take place? At that moment the organ ceased its grand, subduing chorus. There was a bustle at the door, and a bridal train entered. It was dazzlingly   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       19 beautifuil to the little flower girl, and she dared not breathe lest the heavenly vision should be dispelled; and in the throng she recognized the lady who had bade her come. "I can not speak to her now," said she, mentally; "I have never seen anything half so lovely; that lady must be a bride; she does not need my flowers. Look at her eyes; look at her faee; she must be very happy!" They drew near the altar, and Lillian remained spell- bound at the solemnity of the scene. The ceremony was completed, the congratulations uttered, and the bridal party were leaving the church, when, emboldened by a sense of duty, a strong desire of selling the flow- ers, she ventured a few steps and touched the robe of Mrs. Carroll. The lady turned and recognized her protege. "Oh, here is my little flower girl," said she aloud; "are not these flowers beautiful? But, where did you get them, child?" "At home, in our garden," said Lillian in her sweetly peculiar voice and accent. - All eyes turned upon her. " More likely," said' therbride, annoyed at the delay, and jealous of anyattention which was not'bestowed upon herself, " more likely they were pilfered!" If Lillian had never heard the word before,- now she fully comprehended its meaning. "I No, madam," she replied proudly, "I do not steal! I am poor, but honest!" "Humph!" said the irritated lady, "assuming ,I airs!"                  ' 1i   Tears of anger and mortification filled her eyes.  "I will buy your flowers," said Mrs. Carroll; " see!   20        LILLIAN: OR, those roses are befitting a bride." And she whisperede softly, "come to my house, to-morrow, near this church, and inquire for Mrs. Carroll." The bouquets were soon distributed among the bridal party; then Lillian shrunk back into the shadow. The rustling of silks, the swaying of fans, the light laugh and soft whisper died away; even the rich perfume of violet and rose passed out with the train, and all was still. There was a sigh, a groan uttered near her; she listened silently, and turned about to see from whence it came. There, too, in the shadow stood a young man, pale as marble. At length he arose, and reaching out his arms as if to embrace some distant object, cried in a low and mournful voice: "Florence! Florence!" Lillian crept up to him; he started aside. "Sir," said she timidly, " do not be angry; but is that your mother's name?" "No," he replied;" "but why are you listening? Why did you not go with the crowd?" "Do not be angry, sir ;" and she wept bitterly. "No one speaks kindly to me. I was afraid they would not like it; Ebnd the lady said such harsh, unfeeling things." ' Why did you come here?" "The lady Who bought my flowers bade me come." "But why did you ask if that was my mother's name?" "Because," she replied, "I thought, perhaps, your mother was dead." She had unconsciously touched a tender chord. "And is your mother dead, my child?" "Yes, sir."   THE BATTLE OPF LIFE.      21 "Have you no father?" "Yes, sir; but he, too, is going away." "Come, then, I will walk home with you, to see this wonderful garden, where you gathered such beautiful roses." "Do you love flowers, sir? If you wish I will give you a bouquet. But did not that lady look lovely -- the one who spoke so unkindly? I would not have thought her capable of such rudeness." "  My little girl," said he, slowly and sadly, " beauty does not always denote worth. I am sure you would not be happier in her position than you are now." ' Oh, sir! not to ride in a earriage? not to wear such an elegant robe? not to know so much? nor to be loved like her? How can you think so?"  "In the world there is nothing to be desired so much as innocence and virtue-but goodness and the peace it can bestow." "She must be good--so great and lovely-; while, you know, Lillian is plain and coarse. Perhaps that is the reason she thought me dishonest!" "So, that is- your tame. Well, Lillian, honesty is oftener found in plain and homely dress than in rich  and gaudy attire. She did not judge you from that- perhaps upon the principle that others must be like ourselves!" "But I can never be like her, sir," she replied, mis- interpreting his words. "Be like yourself; be true to nature: never seek for that which you can not have; never assume that  which you are not. When did your mother die?  "Oh, it was a night last spring. She had been sick for a long time; every day she grew pale and thin.   22        LILLIAN: OR, We thought the soft air of spring, the scent of the bud- ding maples, the green turf and the sunshine, would re- store her. Often I gathered wild violets and geraniums in the wood near by our house, and carried them to her. But, oh! that night! I can never forget it. The window was open, and the moon was up; while the breeze, so light and gentle, raised the curls that had fallen on her pillow, passing over her white brow and pale lips. She could only speak very faintly. Papa was weeping beside her bed, and she held Eva in her arms. 'Lillian,' said dear mamma, 'you must take care of your sister; you have always been a good child; promise me you will.' I fell on my knees and promised her. Mamma did not speak again, and every thing seemed so dark in the room. There was a cloud over the moon, and the silence of the grave fell on us all. Papa says we must not weep for her. In the sky, you know, the angels are, and she is there; it is only the blue sky between us, and that will roll away, for I have read about it; and you believe it, too, sir." "Yes, Lillian, I do!" He was contemplating the child with a bewildered gaze-so young 'and thought- ful. "But who is Eva?" "Eva is my sister; she looks like mamma, not like me! "But why do you sell flowers?" "My father has had no work for a long time, anad now he is going away to join the army,and we shall be alone!" "But who takes care of Eva?" "I do; when I get home I shall take her into the garden, and work there till sunset.' "But what work can you do?"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       23 "Oh, make Eva some aprons and dresses; there is no one to do it, now mamma is gone. I wish some one would teach me as she used to do--it is very pleasant to learn!"  Herman mentally compared her with the belles of his acquaintance, frivolous and trifling, with no desire -beyond flattery or flirtation. Her opening mind was like the glorious springtime, she had described so touchingly! first the buds and leaves--then the per- feet foliage-the blossoms and at last the fruit-there was promise of a rich and golden harvest. They ar- rived at her father's gate. An acquaintance was soon Tformed between him and her new friend. The orna- ments of the little garden were minutely examined; and the most beautiful gathered for the visitor. "We must not forget Eva," said he; " the visit would be incomplete without her." If Lillian possessed rare mental endowments, Eva was beautiful-a radiant, joyous little creature--a flash of sunshine on the wintry earth. And so Her- mann Travers found her. He took, her on his knee, and twined her curls about his finger, talking to elicit her sweet lisping replies; At last he rose to go. "You have given me these beautiful roses, and here is a ring which I wish you to keep for my sake; it may prove a talisman," said he gaily, " as he unfastened from his guard a hair ring of choice and exquisite workman- ship. "Remember, Lillian, it is for the pleasure of this interview a small token. Perhaps I shall never forget you in the land beyond the sea, where I am go- ing. I shall preserve these flowers and fancy that they embody your innocence and truthful simplicity! '   24        tTTLTTAN: OR, Lillian caught only the words that he was going away: "Oh, sir, she answered, sadly, '" why does every one leave me? I thought you would stay here always, and I could see you every day; it is so strange, I can not understand it!" "Because I have a great aim to accomplish; you shall hear of me, you shall see me again; it may be many years, but the recognition will surely come." And he went out. Sometimes there are words uttered full of prophetic meaning; we know not what we say nor what we - are. Hermann Travers was lifted from his great sorrow by the sympathy of that little child; her sweet voice haunted him, and those words she had spoken, " there is only the blue sky between us, and that shall roll away."  He was by nature an artist, but had never sought to improve the great talent committed to his keeping. Perhaps it was this innate love of the beau- tiful which had opened the door of his soul to Florence Carroll; he resolved henceforth to study the great masters of Italy; to store his mind with rich and clas- sic lore; to sow the seeds of good and loving deeds; to cultivate his soul, leaving no resource unopened to the enrichment of his gifts. On the day succeeding Flor- ence Carroll's marriage, he sailed for Europe. Lillian had treasured all his words within her heart. That evening was the happiest she had experienced since her mother's death. It was an oasis in the desert of her existence, recounting gaily the brilliant appearance of the bridal party she had witnessed to her father and Eva. The sense of duty, well performed, filled her mind with peace, ever its sweet reward. Why had the noble   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       25 and intelligent gentlemen noticed her, a poor and ig- norant girl? Would he trily preserve the flowers she had given him? While the ring was taken from its place of concealment many times, turned over and over and at last hidden in her bosom. Then she believed he was unhappy, and through the long, still watches of the night she could see him in the great church, as he stood with his arms extended, crying, "Florence, Flor- ence!"Her father had not recalled the subject of his intended departure, therefore it ceased to cause her sorrow. Neither had she forgotten Mrs. Carroll's kindly words, with her parting injunction to meet her on the morrow. The flowers had not been mentioned but she would make an offering freely to the beautiful and kindly lady. Her slumbers were protracted in the morning, owing to the excitement of the previous even- ing; her toilette was, however, performed with more than ordinary care--perhaps she would meet the gentle- man who had given her the ring. As her own spirits revived under sunny influence, it appeared that her father was happier. And it was so, since his resolu- tion to join the army, a new ambition had animated him -the  power of conferring happiness upon his children. Then, too, there was chance for him to rise; all these things were duly considered, but he made no reference to them in the presence of his daughter, the contemplation of which had caused her so many tears. But in the mean time all his arrangements were com- pleted, silently and effectually. The regiment was ordered away  within a- week. Lillian had no difficulty in finding the residence of Mrs. Carroll. There she paused for a  moment to contemplate the scene around her. Fountains fell in willow-like sprays, and the air   26         LILLIAN: OR, was vocal with the voices of birds which she could not see, nor could she understand that in the arbor, adorned with climbing roses, was an aviary. The mocking-bird, canary, robin and lark swelled the chorus, while through the open window she could see the graceful and exqui- site drapery, the elegant and costly furniture. "I dare not enter," said she musingly, glancing at her own homely attire. At that moment a rough voice saluted her, and she started in affright: it was a footman in livery. "What do you want here?" "Please let me see Mrs. Carroll." "Go away, and do not trouble Mrs. Carroll." Lillian turned to obey him, but that lady having heard the conversation within, bade the servant call the little flower girl to her. Tremblingly, she entered, mute with surprise and delight at all she saw about her. Her own flower garden had been transplanted to the luxurious carpet. Lillian could not hear a footfall. "You are dreaming, Lillian, tell me of what?" I was never in so beautiful a place, madame; it Seems to me like fairy land-and fairies are so kind, just like yourself, madame." Mrs. Carroll knew that this was no studied phrase, but the honest expression of a grateful sentiment. Come here, Lillian, I am pleased with you; sit down; would you like to come and live with me?" "Oh, yes, live in such a delightful home; live witl you, and would you love me?" "Yes, if you were obedient and gentle. I had but one daughter, Lillian, and now she has gone away; i was she whom you saw in the church. I shall feel ver.   H       rTHE BATTLE OF LIFE.     27 lonely without her, and if you wish to come and live with me, you shall do so." "Oh, madame, I can not! Little Eva and papa are at home, it would break their hearts!" "What can you do-such a child?" "Every thing!  I can comfort papa, when he is weary, and take care of little Eva. I can not come," "Well, I will not urge you, but you can visit me sometimes, and we shall always be friends." Then she led Lillian through the high and spacious apartments, and out into the aviary, where the mystery was explained, and she could listen rapturously to the graceful mocking-bird. "Would you like a canary, Lillian? would you take care of it and feed it every day, and give it fresh water? It will sing for you and Eva as well as for -me." "Will you give me one, madame?" "Yes, and a cage to carry it home; you must not let the little prisoner escape, or he will not return." Lillian was in an ecstacy of delight; it' was but a step to her from the mansion home; joy lent her wings; grateful and happy in the love she had won, and the confidence reposed in her.    28        TTLLTTAN: OR, CHAPTER III. FLORENCE CARROLL had not made as mistaken a choice as had her fond and doating husband. Although many years older than herself, his heart still retained some freshness of youth. The world had not robbed him of every vital emotion. He was still alive to the beautiful. In youth, he had formed an ideal of woman, but it had existed only in imagination, until he saw his bride. Alfred Moore was proud of her attractions, but not only that, he had hoped in his present bright exist- ence to revive his youth, to repose upon the confidence and love of a trusting and gentle heart. Alas! for this early dream; alas! for the present fatality. They em- barked in the Queen of the Sea for an European tour. Excited and flushed by admiration, Florence never ap- peared more charming, and her husband regarded his newly-found treasure as all his own. Nothing had yet occurred to mar the serenity of their peace. The proud ship sailed gayly over the placid ocean, but the novelty of the scene-the solemnity of the great deep awakened no response in her soul. The sun dipped his fiery disc in the foaming waters-his farewell kiss lingered on the wave, reflected in azure-in gold-in soft and mel- low shades. Some passengers were seated on the deck in groups-some still lingered below--others stood drinking in the glory of the scene. There was one-a foreigner, who, by his distinguished air and admiring gaze, had attracted the attention of Florence-her eyes following all his movements. Her husband finding her   ITH BATTLE OF LIFE.      29 indisposed to converse pleasantly, sought the society of a friend. She was in a soft and dreamy mood, quite inconsistent with her real nature. The stranger drew near and addressed her: "This is a glorious scene, miss; look at those clouds! at those gentle waves! see, how lightly the breeze swells the sail of the great ship. Nature is always new, grand and impressive!" He seated himself gracefully beside her, recounting tales of the distant lands he had visited, mingling po- etry and history, romance and fiction, till even Flor- ence, the cold and phlegmatic, was apparently awakened by his eloquence. "And that gentleman who just left you is your father?" said he, inquiringly. A light laugh was the reply. "He ought to be my father, surely, instead of my husband." "Ah, I understand; you are his bride." "Yes," and she sighed softly, "I had no one to ad- vise me differently." But there had been a listener to those bitter words. Moore, having wearied of his friend, had returned to seek Florence, and paused in the shadow, not listen- ing, but unconsciously regarding her new acquaint- ance. Swiftly the arrow penetrated his soul, but he stood still, trying to realize his new position. The hum of voices and the sound of laughter grated harshy on his ear. The stars came out and burned steadily- steadily on the bosom of the Infinite, where every sigh is treasured up, and where for every tear shed by mortals there have been drops of blood. He was still unloved.   30        LILLIAN: OR, "Young, beautiful and deceptive!" he murmured, "Where is the perfect rest I had pictured to my- self? Where is the dawning hope that filled my soul with light? Gone down with the sun! But, perhaps, by gentleness and kind consideration, I can woo her yet to love me! No reproach shall ever fall from my lips. I will lavish all upon her, and if in the end it fail me,; God be my help! There is naught remaining!" He could not seek her side again, and so went below to bury his grief and disappointment in solitude and darkness. The time wore away, and the great bell of the ship tolled the hour of midnight before she returned to the cabin. They journeyed through England and France-the one seeking sympathy in Nature, the other food for her vain and foolish fancies. Every letter which she wrote home to her loving parents was filled with ac- counts of their delightful tour; and to them she never spoke disparagingly of her husband, knowing that she would obtain no sympathy from them-as he had been for many years their friend. They had at first op- posed the marriage, owing to the disparity in years, consoling themselves, however, upon her choice that he was high and noble, kind and gentle, rich and influ- ential, and said many times, " better be an old man's darling than a young man's slave,"-and as they con- cluded she was happy, rejoiced in her prosperity. We can not look into the souls of those who are nearest and dearest to us. There is only one great King of all secrets, and in the day of His appearing how start- lingly will many revelations flash upon us. They did not linger amid the rural scenes of Eng-   TRE BATTLE OF LIEE.      81 land; although according with the views of Moore, they were tame and indifferent to the haughty Florence- the glare and glitter of courts were best adapted to her temperament. The vivacious flattery of the French enchanted her. Not even a word or look from her unhappy husband indicated his disappr'bation. She would have lingered there forever, but Moore urged the necessity of passing on, as their tour must be com- pleted in the fall. Every where adulation and homage a were offered to her beauty, and she was still unsat- isfied. In Italy, the novelties of art and science-her Romeo once queen of the world, were not viewed by her in an historical light, but as a pleasant change in the pro- gramme, and only in excitement and variety could the t restless spirit of Moore abide. Basking beneath tfhe sunny skies; inhaling that balmy atmosphere; gliding over the placid waves of the'Adriatic, there was still somewhat wanting.  At Naples, Florence was threat- ened with a  malignant fever. Then her false friends forsook her; the throng of admirers deserted her, leav- ing her alone with him whom she had so deeply wrong- ed; to whom she had plighted her vows unscrupulously, without remorse, when her heart was far away. Through that, long and tedious illness, Aloore was ever beside her, bathing her temples, cooling her parched lips, soothing her wild and impotent ravings with the gen, tleness and forbearance of a, woman. How silently he glided about; how tenderly he held her hand and spoke loving words; watching, waiting :for a smile or glance as his recompense. It was food fr days; but, like the heavenly manna which sustained the Israelites, must be renewed. Under such kindly treatment the malady   32        jTTAN: OR, was soon controlled; it had, however, made some in- roads on her beauty, and fearing this, she ordered a mirror to be brought to her. Her husband was power- less to avert the blow. With a wild moan of regret and despair the glass was thrown down and shattered in a thousand pieces. "So perish my happiness and ambition forever!" she exclaimed fiercely. -" Her husband stole to her couch, and, taking her hand, said softly: "Not your happiness, Florence, if you will only in- trust it to my keeping; I will cherish it as a delicate flower; give me that which you have so long denied-- your love and confidence! His gentle and touching etreaty was answered in a scornful voice. t sMtir. Moore, let me tell you once for all! seek not to obtain that which you can never have. Be content," she added, in a milder tone, " with the hand which has been bestowed upon you?" "But why," said he, forgetting himself, " why did you, then, bestow that hand, worthless without the heart? When one discovers he has received spurious coin, what does he with it? Fling it aside as worth- less! Your youth and seeming innocence, your gen- tleness and beauty captivated me; I gave you my heart! What if it be old? it is not callous; if it be not comely, it possesses honesty." ; Your insinuations," she replied, angrily, "' can not affect me! It were wise in you, perhaps, to remember whom you are addressing." "Madame," he replied sternly, "you have trifled with my heart enough! Know, now, that I am re- solved you shall not trifle with your vows even in ap-   'H'E BATTLE OF LIFE.      83 pearance. Your light flirtations, your little artifices must cease from this time. I had thought never to re- proach you; to love and suffer silently; but, hence- forth as you are mine, guard your conduct. When you are sufficiently recovered, we will return to our own quiet home. Perhaps, in a country seat,afar from ad- ulation and flattery, you may be constrained to with- draw your wicked foibles. Do not think I have been blind all this time-no! it was my great love for you which kept me silent; but, for the future, beware how you trifle with my- honor." The excitement caused by this sudden outhreaks acted upon her already exhausted nerves, and she-tell back in something like a swoon. Then remorse suc- ceeded his recent calm determination to be respecte'd if not loved! He lifted her tenderly from the conch- and carried her to the open window, and with a faint sigh she revived. A band of roving minstrels, so com- mon to that romantic country, paused below; in a wild and plaintive melody, one sang to the guitar, and, as her eye fell on Florence, she broke forth into a peculiar chant, prophetic of the future, which thrilled the listen- ers by its strange adaptation to their unhappy circum- stances: Love but once, and love no more, Then the blissful dream is o'er I Spring and winter-youth and age, Sorrow is their heritage I Seek not warmth where all is cold, Gilded o'er with hollow gold I Moore arose and closed the window. It was true, he thought, she had bartered her own peace and ruined   34        ULT TTAN: OR, his forever. It was too late now to redeem his happi- ness from the hand of the destroyer. Past the prime of life, hope loses its buoyancy. He determined upon their return to render his home attractive and beauti- ful; to surround his bride with all that can gratify the taste; still there would be a fearful void nothing could supply. Florence gradually but surely recovered strengtn with health, and, as these returned, beauty came back. New light flashed in her eyes; new color on her cheek and lip, and fresh elasticity to her step; and, as her husband looked on admiringly, he felt the disparity in ther years more keenly. He was growing older; sor- row, disappointment and anxiety had added silver to his locks and weariness'to his step. Had Florence but known that in that very land of classical associations, there was one truly dearer to her than her own hus- band, she would have sought him at all hazards. He was there; but her image existed no longer in his soul; it had been cast out as soon as she was wedded to an- other. The mirror of his soul had never been darkened by evil reflections, therefore it was untarnished. The sublime conceptions of genius, as well as the true ap- preciation of the lofty and beautiful, can not exist in an impure nature! Poetry, painting and music, like spiritual gifts, must be wooed by as potless life. He sought only tlbose destined to bring their great reward -to be a secret and unfailing source of pleasure-of thrilling emotions which only few can understand-to bring fame in the grand result! With Florence and her husband -their tour had been prolific of no good results. They were neither wiser, better nor happier. So let us leave them for awhile   THE BATTL OF LIFE. on their return in the cold realization of their domesti infelicity. Let not the fatalist-say that we are crea tures of circumstances-man may mold his destiny- it can not mold him! f,A   36         .TT TA^W-: OR, CHAPTER IV. AGREEABLE to his purpose, the father of Lillian, Mr. Rosebrough, had enlisted, and received a portion of the bounty which was offered to volunteers. With tender care and watchful love he expended a good share to ren- der their little hole comfortable and pleasant during his weary absence. The pantries were well filled, the wardrobe supplied with new clothing, while the aspect of things beeame brighter and more cheerful. In the bustle of preparation, Lillian nearly overlooked the great event which was about to take place. Aunt Margaret, the new housekeeper and fbstermother, ar- rived and was installed in her office. Lillian instinc- tively compared her with her own dear mother, so light and graceful, so gentle and winning, for love was shad- owed forth in every action, in striking contrast with the repulsive manner of the former. The instinct of children will discern traits invisible to the world. "But after all," thought she, "' Aunt Margaret will be kind to us, and we shall soon become accustomed to her ways, and learn to respect her, or papa would never have brought her here." It was strange how he had become blinded; nothing would have induced him to this fatal step, had he not believed in his heart that she would cherish his little ones, and prove a kind and efficient, house- keeper. Already she seemed to regard the golden- haired, blue-eyed, prattling Eva with the fondest care, and Lillian was courted, that she might obtain her favor and influence,   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      37 "How do you like your new friend?" said Mr. Rose- brough to his daughter. "She must be good, papa, or you would not have chosen her." A shade of disappointment passed over his-face. "And is that all you can say?"He spoke in a tone of disapprobation. "I think we shall like her, but she does not resemble mamma.' "Strange child! always-original--a mind and opinion of your own--promise me now that you will do your duty, be obedient and obliging, ready of instruction and respectful. These will insure her approbation." "I will do all that you could wish. But must you go?" "I can not," said he, "now retract if I would. The bounty has been  accepted and partially expended. Perhaps in time I shall be enabled to return to you and Eva; to purchase a home, to exalt you above your present position, to bestow many accomplishments upon you. Think of this little dreamer," he continued gayly, "it is a bright picture, and perhaps a true one?" Was he not also dreaming?  His trunk was neatly prepared and packed by the skillful hands of his dutiful and loving daughter. The picture of his wife, together with those of his children, were placed near his heart for safekeeping, and that-he might also glance at them in leisure moments without being  observed. Well might he cherish them! they were all his earthly trea- sures! for a man's wealth consists not in the multitude of his possessions, but in the depth and sincerity of the hearts which ate his own. And so he bore them away with him; not that he should fail to remember them as he saw them last, but that memory might be strengthened  38        TTTTTAN: OR, and confirmed, the shadowy assume a more real and liv. ing aspect. These, with the Bible which he had used for years, were sacred to him as his hope of heaven.. Upon his marriage with the beautiful woman of his choice, he had been in comfortable circumstances. But one misfortune after another had swept his little estate gradually away, until there was nothing But the cottage remaining, and that under heavy mortgage. He had vainly endeavored to rise above it, but as the tide swelled higher and higher resistance seemed of no avail, and he floated onward with it. The death of his wife had awakened new impulses in his heart-he determined now to be what she would have him, for the sake of the departed and for their little ones! The day of his de- parture arrived. They visited the churchyard together. Upon the grave of the sleeping wife and mother, loving hands had planted the white rose and delicate mille fleur, with the purple pansy, emblem of mourning. Near by, a river rippled as it wound past the foliage and drooping willows which skirted the banks, now in sunlight now in shadow, ever singing a lullaby, a touching requiem to the departed. Silently they came and turned away, looking down to the green earth in its robe of beauty-looking up to the blue sky clear and tranquil as a mirror in its spotless purity. The sun had just emerged from a cloud, and the fresh gush of sunshine reanimated all creation. "So," said Rosebrough, "hope lingers in the heart; though clouds overshadow it they will disperse! Hope is the soul's eternal sun, shining on through this exist- ence, down into the silent valley, up to the illimitable abode of peace and glory I Let your mind, my Lillian, never become darkened; there is no remedy for de"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      89 spair-it is the last bitter drop in the cup of human misery," and he sighed as memory recalled the past- his broken resolutions. The conversation became hope- ful and earnest. Upon their return they lingered in the little garden, Lillian gathering for him the choicest flowers, while he sat near by on a bank, watching her light and airy figure with a sad but loving smile. His hat was lifted from his brow, that the grateful breeze might kiss it, while Eva played at his feet, unconscious of the gathering tempest in her young life's horizon. The ecstatic current of childhood ebbed and flowed like the tide of the sea in her heart and through her bright existence. Aunt Margaret, with a tact that did honor to her, remained within the cottage, rightly conjecturing that these moments were precious to the little group. Not from any delicacy of feeling, but from a desire of pop- ularity, knowing that her presence would be unwel- come, she did not interrupt them, but remained wait- ing impatiently for the interview to close, longing to establish her supremacy. The parting was not pro- longed. Lillian stood at the gate-her bonnet had fallen back-she was calm and pale, but her large mournful eyes were filled with tears-she had raised Eva in her arms, looking wishfully down the street, after the dear retreating figure. The hands of the lit- tle one were extended, as if beckoning his return. And so he went. But the picture there presented to his view could never be effaced; it filled his mind strangely with a dim foreboding of evil, and a voice whispered: "This is the last!" The shrill tone of Margaret,.now wonderfully natural, recalled them. "Come, you have stood there long enough-it is an 4   40         T T,TLTAN: OR, evil sign to watch the departing. Put up these toys, and never leave them about again. A place for every- thing and everything in its place, remember this." Then there was a fierce and angry tone, mingled with her warning, that made Lillian pause several times and regard her fixedly. Perhaps she was draw- ing invidious comparisons; it was certain they were not favorable to the present mistress of the cottage. "What are you looking at me so sharply for-? Rude manners are very unbecoming a little girl." "Oh, aunt Margaret," said Lillian, in a mournful voice, " did you ever see my mother?" This question was illy calculated to soothe the irri- tated feelings she had aroused. ; Yes, I have seen you mother-a pale, miserable, unhappy looking creature! too proud to work, and too poor to live without it." "You shall not speak so of my dear mamma," said Lillian, kindling with an angry flash, " she was beauti- ful-she was high-born, and a lady." "Oh, ho, that is the way the land lies; take that for your insolence, striking her a blow on the cheek, which glowed like sunset, purple and red; never dare, miss, to speak in that way to me again. I knew that your assumed sweetness of temper would not hold out. -So it breaks forth, before your father has fairly disap- peared. I will soon curb it," and she set her teeth firmly; "s I am no light and playful creature to be tri- fled with, so beware in future." Lillian was sobbing violently--it had opened a new phase of character to her. All the grief occasioned by her father's departure, so long restrained, burst forth like a tempest.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      4] "Stop that whimpering; I will not have those tan- trums; they should be checked early, or they become incontrollable; because I said then as I say now, that your mother was neither beautiful, nor agreeable, she was too high-minded and assuming." "Aunt Margaret," said Lillian, -starting to her feet, with glowing cheek and flashing eye, "Never dare :say that again of my mother, never dare! She was always an angel; she is an angel now, which I fear you will never be." Vivid as lightening was the fire that flashed from the eyes of the infuriate woman. She seized Lillian, by the arm, and hurried her to a small, unfurnished room, which had been used, during her mother's lifetime, as her own private apartment, but from which the furni- ture had now been removed. "There,' said she, mockingly, with an air of triumph, "you can have leisure to get over your ugly temper; we shall see how it will work." Left alone, varied and stormy emotions rushed over her mind-now melting and tender-now swayed by the demons of anger and revenge, till the storm was spent and she could look around her calmly but mourn- fully upon the wrecks of hope and happiness. She could hear the voice of Eva, calling to her--a cry- then a moan, and wild with impotent rage, she knocked and knocked loudly at the door; but the echoes in that solitary room were the only answer. Then all was still again, and she could feel the night settling down over the world-although she could not look out, it was palpable.  Gentler counsels and sweeter thoughts came at her bidding, she .seemed to relive the bright, but brief existence of a happy childhood. She could 'i.'    42        LILLIAN: OR, see the family group kneeling around the altar. She could hear their evening hymn, the solemn accents of devotion in the depth of that solitude. It became darker and darker-fearful images thronged upon her; a pair of burning eyes, like Margaret's, glared- from every corner, and laughed in malice at her misery. She knew there was no appeal which could touch her heart of stone, and so settled down into a dull despair. Exhausted by her efforts, she crouched down into a corner of the desolate room, soon fell asleep, and was aroused only by the grating of the door on its hinges. Starting up, she confronted the woman whom she be- gan to fear, if not to hate. "Oh, aunt Margaret, I did not mean to speak disre- pectfully. Please let me go to Eva!" "I have taken care of Eva," said she, coldly, " the little minx will not resist my authority again; you are well agreed, but not strong enough to war with me." "Oh, aunt Margaret," said she, falling on her knees, before her torturer, "let me go to Eva! let me go! she is a baby yet, she does not know any better." "But I will teach her better," said she, fiercely. "Where is she? where have you put her?" ques- tioned Lillian, frantically. c"There was never an un- kind word spoken to her-no one ever frowned upon her. You will drive me mad!" "Miss," said the malicious woman, "learn to fear my authority. You shall not ask me again. Go to your room!"  It was unavailing-all remonstrance. Lillian felt it keenly, but gliding past her without an. other word, determined to solve the problem for her- self. She explored the cottage-then the garden- there she heard a faint moan-it came from the cellar.   THE BATTLE OF -LIFE.      43 Her blood ran cold. ' How was she fulfilling her prom- ise to a dying mother? Was she shielding Eva from grief and pain? In an instant she was at the door- but is was barred to her. "Eva, my Eva, speak to me! it is I, Lillian." "Take me away-take me away-it is night, I am afraid; I am tired." "Oh, I can not reach you, but wait a moment "-and remembering the window which was low, open and easy of access, she was but an instant in clambering through it there she soon discovered her darling-pale, cold, shivering with fear-she was soon in her arms-pressed ;o her faithful bosom. They went out again into the re- viving air of the summer night. She scarcely dare enter the cottage, but the silence which reigned around emboldened her, and carrying Eva, she fled, without looking back, to her own room, where they forgot their sorrows in a quiet oblivion, and ceased to picture those which were to come. On the following morning, Mar- garet was in a more agreeable mood. There was no allusion to the circumstances of the past day, and Lil- " lian hoped they would never occur again. She was also going to school with Eva, and that was an inex- haustible source of delight. Her studies were pursued with zeal and unfeigned pleasure. By and by there came a letter from her father-a long and vivid de scription of his journey to the South, where the nem recruits had been ordered. "You can imagine, my daughter," said he, for I know you are a little dreamer, "your father in this land of flowers and romance. Away to the far South, stretch the groves of pimento, satinwood and magno- lia. The latter are now in blossom-unlike anything   "        TTT,LTAN: OR, you ever saw-large, and white and clustering, grace- ful and fragrant. The orange and lemon, found here, of which you know something, but can not imagine their beautiful appearance; they are covered with fruit, foliage, buds and blossoms, presenting a strange vari- ety-a combination of all the seasons. The cotton plant is cultivated here, and we can see all we desire of negro life. The water is limpid, and many little natural lakes are scattered through the country. Our camp is pitched in the most shady place, for the sun shines with scorching heat, and many have sickened and died with the change of climate. But do not fear for me; I am well, strong and hopeful. We have had no battle yet, but are daily expecting one. When I sleep you are before me, you and little Eva, as I saw you last, and your pictures are an unfailing source of pleas- ure. In your letters tell me everything-what you are learning-if you love school, and your foster mother- if little Eva ever speaks of me; put her in mind of her papa at times-because you know it is all for you and her that I am laboring. With this letter there is a re- mittance to Margaret, who will I hope dispose of it to the best advantage for your comfort. How is the lit- tle garden thriving? The roses must be gone. In this fairy land of enchantment the air is fragrant with the perfume of blossoms, and vocal with the melody of birds. Perhaps, when the war is over, we will take a tour though the southern country, and you may then behold in reality what is now with you only an imagin- ary picture. Take good care of the canary, and when I return, I will surely bring some of the sweet singing birds, which abound in the forests here.

But you know, my dear child, that we do not own this cottage-once it was ours, but there is now a heavy mortgage on it, which I hope to remove before the close of the year. Anything you have to say about home and friends will be delightful to me--for you must know that I am sometimes lonely and dispirited. Wishing you were here, or I there, good by! good by! God bless you, keep you, my darlings; lift up the light of His coun- tenance upou you, and give you peace." The letter was read many times, placed in her bosom, taken out and kissed, till it was soiled and defaced. The remittance considerably mollified aunt Marga- ret who treated them more kindly upon its receipt, but Lillian could not perceive any addition to their house- hold stores. The summer flowers had faded from the garden, and in their place the tall dhalias and gayly colored annuals flaunted in the sunlight. T-he foliage was ripening, and the forest trees loomed up like ban- ners, painted with flame-color-orange and dark green. Already the foot of man was on the glory of the sum- mier-the pride of the woodland. Lillian continued to gather bouquets, but secretly, fearing the avarice of the old house-keeper, which (even the tact of childhood had discerned) would compel her to desist or appropriate the trifling proceeds. These were carefully concealed with her father's letters and the hair ring, the giver of which was still fondly and distinctly remembered. The can- ary, too, was an unfailing source of delight. She would listen for hours to his melodious warblings, surround- ing herself with the ideal world--living in a fairy   "        LILLIAN: OR, dream. But the beautiful palaces of her creation were built too high for earth-she could not enter them. The wind was gradually shifting about, destined to demolish--to scatter them piece by piece upon the rocks, We have gone back in our story from the last chap- ter, to trace the events which had transpired in the life of the little flower girl. This brings us to the date of Florence Moore's return with her husband to their ele- gant but unhappy home. Lillian had not visited Mrs. Carroll since that memorable day, when the magnifi- cence which had been revealed to her, opened a secret fountain of joy, furnishing aliment for daily visions.  But now, her father's letters became more rare-she had replied to them faithfully, inclosing her own al- ways in those of Margaret, which was a convenient suggestion of the latter. Not even a smile awaited them upon their return from school--and it pleased Marga- ret to withdraw them entirely, saying that Lillian must learn to work, as it would be her vocation-perhaps before long! Lillian, tremblingly, ventured to expos- ;: tulate. "But papa wished me to learn a great deal, and he will be disappointed upon his return."  She was answered, fiercely:;            i "When he returns! Do not flatter yourself that he will ever come back-already he has ceased to write, and how are you to be fed and clothed through the long, cold winter?" Lillian was unable to answer, but remained white and speechless. "Yes," she 'continued, maliciously, I have known your fancies all the time-you have imagined yourself I   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      47 some great lady, which you will never be; poring over a book, or idly dreaming. It is time you were in- structed in your duty." "But will my father never come back?" said she, bursting into tears. "'Likely not," replied her tormentor, with a sneer; "he is too glad to be rid of his unprofitable burden-he is wise; perhaps, there is some woman in the secret." Lillian could not comprehend these significant words, nor the sinister expression which accompanied them. It was well she did not; there was enough visible to fill her mind with uneasiness-to disturb the serenity of her soul. - Every flower faded from the garden, and the first light snow fell on the bending shrubs. The eaves of the cottage glistened with icicles, and every one foretold a severe and tedious winter. Then they were often left alone in the cottage; without fire or food. The proceeds of Lillian's bouquets were called. into requisition- furnishing them with some small' comforts. But-this did not escape the argus eyes that were ever fastened secretly upon them. "Where did you buy this bread," said she, coming suddenly upon them, "-and cakes? You are living pretty well on nothing.  Tell me instantly! if you are accused of stealing, I shall also be implicated." "I did not steal them." "But where did you get them, then?" ,- "Oh, aunt Margaret, if you must know, I bought the bread and cakes." "A likely story! -You bought them without money, eh  ?" and she raised her hand menacingly; Lillian, with the quick impulse of love and watchfulness, raised :Eva   48        LILLIAN: OR, in her arms, in order to shelter her when the storm should burst. "Do not strike me, and I will tell you all!" She then proceeded to state that she had sold the flowers from their garden, daily, and concealed the profits. "Ungrateful and strange child," said she, "when yo u knew I was perishing for the want of money, why did you not give it me? But have you any more of the same kind?" A falsehood rushed to her lips, but she could not utter it, and her face flushed crimson at the thought. "Tell me where it is," said the old woman, rightly interpreting her silence and the change in her counte- nance. "But you will take it away from me?" 4"What do I want of your money?" said she, with a sneer, ' I will not ask you again! tell me?" Lillian turned away with a sigh, and drew a little box from the corner of the room, where it had been concealed so long. It was eagerly seized and rifled of its contents. "My ring and letters! oh, give them to me, and take the money if you wish." After examining it a long time in the light, and deeming it worthless, it was sullenly returned. s"And my letters?" But the old woman rightly conjecturing that if they were destroyed, the address would be lost, and all com- munication cut off between them, tore the package into shreds, Pale, Silent and tearful, and holding Eva in her arms, Lillian crept away. What' remained to her? A memory-a dim haunting of happiness which Cou6ld not be hers-a sad foretaste of the future. There still   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       49 existed in her mind a strong hope of escape from her cruel mistress-perhaps her father would return and put an end to all this misery. But her bright and beautiful associations were passing away, dying as her little bird had died, for want of kindliness and suste- nance. In vain she wooed them to her embrace, the rose-light was sadly changing to purple. Snow had fallen heavily, and there was nothing visible but the white and sparkling robe. Tortured every mo- ment by fears of her father's death, there was no more dreaming-reality pressed upon her cold and stern! Eva, too, seemed to feel this great change in their for- tune; she ceased to prattle, and caught something of the despondency visible everywhere. Christmas was ap- proaching, and Lillian recalled the delightful holidays of old-the tree laden with gifts-their merry greet- ings-their sweet, instructive lessons. She resolved that Eva should suffer no more; whatever sorrow and trial awaited her, they should be hers alone-unshared by the delicate blossom committed to her keeping. There was one alternative remaining--an appeal to her friend, Mrs. Carroll, whom she had not seen for a long time. Once she had offered her a home, and now, it might be extended to Eva instead. Thanksgiving had passed, unnoted by them, for it brought no festivities. Many susnicions were excited in the mind of Lillian- . suspicions of foul play on the part of Margaret. She reasoned thus with herself, "If my father had not supplied her with means, iWould she still remain here and furnish the scanty subsistence which is every day eked out to us? Would we be allowed to live in the cottage which papa has assured me was not ours?" These questions she could not answer. ' But if the   50        ,ILIAN: OR, letters were received, why were they not given to her?" All was darkness and impenetrable mystery! It was Christmas Eve-heaven glittered with-her countless orbs, and with them, invisible, inaudible, there were companies of the angelic hosts, re-echoing the hymn of peace on earth, good will to men-the angelic anthem which can never die-which heralded the'advent of the King of Glory. And the bright fires and beaming lights in the happy homes of men illumi- nated the spacious streets of the populous city. But for Eva and Lillian there was no illumination-and the heart of the latter throbbed painfully with remembrance of the past-with the dreary prospect of the present. The merry jingle of sleighs, the childish burst of laqighter--the precious gift and grateful surprise were not for them. Lillian was weeping bitterly, there was no light in their dwelling, scarcely any fire! "I will go," said she, " and seek my only friend! if she be still as kind and gentle as of old, there is hope- for little Eva! not for me!" Eva was soon wrapped in t6e cloak which had been her father's last gift, her hood was carefully tied,.and holding the little hand tightly they emerged into the street. "Oh, it is so pretty, Lillian, but I am very cold!" "We will soon be there, darling, where there is light and fire-where you will be happy and loved!" Then a choking sensation and a sob closed the sen- tence-for fancy pictured her separation from all that she loved; from her father, that was real-from her sister, that was yet to be consummated! Their pro- gress was slow and painful, for the earth was hard and frozen and incrusted with ice. But they arrived -at   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      51 last before the stately mansion-it shone with a thou- sand beacons streaming far out into the night. Music and laughter, sounds of rejoicing, greeted the wander- ers. They listened-at last there was a pause in the chorus. I' I dare not venture'-I dare not!" "Let us go home, Lillian, I am. o cold!" She could not resist, her hand was on the bell; it was a timid ring, but the benevolent lady of the mansion heard it, and bade the porter open without delay. "It may be,"' said she, "some one who has come to ask aid; for there are many to-night," added she, turn- ing to the little group who stood near, " many who have   no Christmas-tree--no  gifts-no  home-no friends! Bring them in." She was instantly obeyed, and they were ushered into her presence. "Why, if this is not my little Flower Girl! What brought you here this cold night-and who is this with you?" A  burst of tears was her only reply, and the best appeal which she could make. "Come, do not weep any more," and she raised Eva in her arms, untied the hood, unfastened the cloak, and gazed with admiration upon the beautiful child. The night air had flushed her face with a vivid hue, her long light hair fell in graceful ringlets, and floated over her young brow with a golden glory-her expressive blue eyes gleamed with delight and animation, the long lashes drooped sometimes with timid fear. Mrs. Car- roll pressed the trembling fugitive to her kindly bosom, and said, "Come with me, my   children, I will hear your story now."   52        LILLIAN: OR, It was soon related, simply and touchingly, by Lil- lian, who had recovered her self-possession at the lov- ing manner of her friend. "Madame," said she, "I did not mean to beg your favor for myself, but for little Eva, my sister!' "I will do all that lies in my power for you both, and to begin, we must commemorate this festive evening with the band of merry children, whom I have invited for the occasion." There was no resisting such generous impulses-all the light and beauty of happier days flashed back upon their hearts, kindling the present and the future with undying radiance.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      53 CHAPTER V. TRIFLES compose the sum of human existence--great actions flash upon us like meteors, and master spirits are still more rare; they are formed in the school of adversity, or by some sudden and startling combination of circumstances-those great convulsions of the morJl and social world, which have sundered kingdoms- dyeing royal purple in blood, and snatching the crowns of kings and emperors. So were the world's greatest heroes formed. Adversity expands and- ripens genius; as the early frost irmparts fresh bloom and flavor to our most delicious fruits. Hermann Travers arrived at Milan--everything that he saw, delighted and inspired him. The strange and romantic scenes through which he had passed, floated around him with ineffable charm. He had ceased to hear in his soul the echoes of a beloved voice-but the fair and deceitful image returned sometimes with start- ling vividness. It had left a vacancy-a vague feeling of unrest-life appeared under a new and troubled as- pect.  Something must supply the lost hopes and dreams, which had been shattered at the shrine of his idol. Devotion to his beloved art-the cultivation of that gift, which so long had lain dormant, was the only panacea presented to his wounded spirit. The chalice which she held to his lips, contained the elixir of a high and exalted existence-he would drain the cup- he would explore the} novel world, just opened to his astonished vision-the world of ar'! In accordance   54        LILLIAN: OR, with this firm, but silent determination, he had fitted up a studio, containing models of the finest artists, for study and imitation. That which filled his eye more than any other was an exquisite painting of the Ma- donna-he had placed it in the soft light of the Italian sunset. An atmosphere of glory floated over the di- vine contour-the soft, dove-like eyes were partially shaded, looking down upon the little cherub in her arms-the exquisitely formed and tinted lips were opened as if breathing words of love and tenderness. And there it stood, life-like, angelic, beside another, a representation of "Christ, blessing little Children." And as he gazed upon these, melting away with the sunlight, fading as a spiritual presence, a rustling sound disturbed his meditations--he turned and con- fronted a priest of the Roman order--for a few mo- ments they were silent-each looking, studying, wait- ing for the other. The stranger was a tall, dark man, with a pale and intellectual cast of fe&atures. There was'a quiet dignity also in his manner, which insured respect. An artist, sir?" in the Italian accent. "A poor, but honest imitator of the great masters," was the reply. "I see evidences of taste, if none of your skill, in the beautiful paintings by which you are surrounded ;" and he bowed with reverence before the Madonna, lift- ing his hat, and making the sign of the cross. "The Mother of Jesus," he continued, thoughtfully, "the Holy Virgin demands our homage, let us not rob her of her rightful suffrage. E Friend, whether American or Italian, for the latter I think you are not, can you paint a portrait from a miniature on ivory?"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      55 A troubled look passed over the face of Hermann, he would rather the man had never come, and replied cautiously. "Perhaps not to please an artist's eye." "But will you undertake it? The reward shall be sure and liberal. In time, if we become friends, and I doubt not we shall, the matter may be more fully explained," said he, nervously; "but for the present it must remain a profound secret; you must not ex- pose the picture, nor mention the fact of my appear- ance in your studio. I have sought you because you are here unknown, and therefore my secret will be safer. Can you comply with my terms?" In the meantime, Hermann had been regarding the stranger with an earnest and inquiring gaze, that al- most said: "Who are you? or whence do you come?" A thrill of superstitious awe was awakened in his mind. But there was an air of frankness and mild benignity in the manner of the stranger which could not be mistaken. He was honest, but shrouded in mystery, which time might unravel-he was mortal- not spirit! "I will paint the picture," he answered in a firm, unbroken voice, but beware Sir Priest how you trifle with my feelings, my honor or my life." "There is nothing to fear," said he, in a mild and melancholy tone. "You see in me a man for whom this world should have nothing-over whom it should have no power-a man who has forsaken home and friends-who has abjured -the ties of social life forever, for the sake of the cross, 'and for the love of Him who -died upon it, to obtain that peace which is not earth- born, but heavenly!"   56        LILLIAN: OR, "And have you found it?" said Hermann, eagerly echoing the words in his own soul; " have you found it?" "Not yet-not yet," he answered, sadly; "the cin- ders of an unholy fire still smoulder in my bosom. The past is not atoned. Not till then-then-peace will come." The anxious and eager countenance of Hermann fell. "If you have not found it, how can you direct others? if you have not tasted, how do you know it is there?' "I know it-see it-but only like a phantom before my eyes-bidding me follow--beckoning me on-on to the full light of perfect day," and he looked upward with a troubled and searching glance. "It is a delusion-you can not trust it. When the traveler sees the mirage in the desert, do not the green shades and cool waters glitter and wave before his eyes? He pants to reach the enticing phantom-he follows- it recedes, lingering for a moment, invitingly-he pur- sues! in vain! the waters never cool his lips; the breezes never fan his brow. He sinks down and per- ishes in sight of the beautiful and tantalizing vision. Such is that peace, which I have never known, which you have vainly sought--which the world can not possess. Show me where it abides, how it may be wooed-it is enough-I desire no more." The priest replied by raising his hands and eyes to heaven. "There! there! it is there!" "Intangible! imperceptible! unsatisfying!" 'u Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face-faith is the foundation-the essence of our hope--but," -he continued, "it can not be obtained   TH]: BATTLE OP LIFE.      57 without a sacrifice. One thing is lacking-go and sell all thou hast, and follow me; thou shalt have treasure in heaven! Would you sacrifice this beautiful and be- loved art, which evidently you worship for that hope?" "Why sacrifice my art? Can they not exist to- gether; are they incompatible?" "We will talk of this again! see, the sun has set!" and he drew from his bosom a miniature painted on ivory. Hermann started and turned pale. Florence had given him just such a miniature, which had been returned upon the day of her marriage with another. But he quickly recovered. There might be many such in the world-it was impossible that her likeness had preceded or followed him there. "Look at -this picture in the after-glow of sunset," said the priest, enthusiastically, and they walked to the window, which looked out upon a small inclosure of fra- grant shrubs, peculiar to Italy. The sun had set, but that after-glow, seen only in this country, lingered in the quiet blue above, tinted the wave, colored earth and air. He took the picture hurriedly. One glance suf- ficed-he was giddy, intoxicated. Amazed and bewil- dered, he dared not look up, but there it was before him-tender, reproachful-the very same from which he had vainly fled. "Have you seen this picture before?" said the priest, in a tone of surprise. Hermann answered with effort, ' Once I had a friend -now no more-the picture recalled her to mind-but she has been dead a long time-at least it seems a long time to me." True, she was dead to him--alive to the world and its pleasures.   58         LILLIAN: OR ' The features," said the priest, regarding him in- tently, " are purely American. The Italian women are beautiful--but not like this! The beautiful," added he, mournfully, " they fade like a dream-they vanish, and we can not grasp them! they are not!"  "Where did you obtain this picture?" and Hermann returned the searching look. "Seek to know no more! let it suffice that the origi- nal is lost forever!" and he sighed, deeply. "-Some other time, for I shall see you frequently, we will dis- cuss the theme still unsatisfied-the theme of our great Religion-the validity of its doctrine, the saving power of our Mother, the Church; perhaps we shall both profit, and one may be enlightened. Your hand in parting! Remember, my secret must remain inviolate; a priest should never love-but that is in the past;" and he went slowly out in the dim shadows of evening, which had succeeded that brilliant sunset. Hermann did not rise, but continued to hold the miniature in a convulsive grasp. At length the spell was broken, his grief found utterance. "I had thought to flee this image, to bury it deep in oblivion, to find amid new scenes and excitements the obscurity and relief which I desire; but there is no rest-no rest-it has preceded me," and iris hand opened and closed with spasmodic motion. "It shall be supplanted! it must be overcome." A fierce deter- mination gleamed in his eyes. Then softer and sadder feelings took possession of his soul, and amid all the shifting shadows he saw again the little flower girl, and her token of dried roses and violets, which had been preserved as a relic. At first it was only afar off, then it came nearer and nearer, till it nestled lovingly in his   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      59 bosom, diffusing a sweet serenity over his troubled life. 'He thought long and unsatisfactorily upon the strange appearance of the priest, his- earnest and impressive manner, while the question recurred without solution, "How and where had he obtained that picture?"But it could be nothing to him now, and the sooner banished the better for his temporal peace, for his eternal happi- ness. It must not intervene between his soul and the great undertaking upon which he had entered. And so the night crept in upon him stealthily, leaving him lonely and depressed. The bell of the cathedral had tolled the vesper hour, and the vesper star arose and walked in serene majesty through the illimitable courts. above; it touched the face-of the Madonna with pen- sive grace-his eye -became riveted upon it. "It is divine," said he; " but not more so than this I hold in my hand-and she is false! I will delineate this picture: I will school my heart till it ceases to torture--till there is no pang, no feeling of regret re- maining. But this miniature is not needed to the exe- cution of my design, memory and imagination supply the original!" The priest, as he had promised, did not fail to visit the artist every day, watching each stroke of the pencil, lingering over each line with the devotion of a lover. The constant theme of discourse was that which had first occurred between them. An interest was gradu-  ally awakened in the mind of each, concerning the other. On one subject only they were silent, that of the picture and of the original. And as the portrait was transferred to- canvas, the artist became accustomed to it, steeling his heart to the sweet but mournful feelings it inspired.   60         TtLTA N: OR, "Go with me to the cathedral this Christmas eve," said the priest; "in the beauty of our ceremonies, in the sacred ritual of our worship, you will find that for which you have so long yearned, and which must meet response in every heart, especially in one like yours, just awakened, either by disappointment or sotne other adversity, to the cold, unsatisfying realities of life. Promise me you will go!" Hermann replied somewhat evasively and sarcastic- ally, "Can you insure my life and safety? these fetes have not been prolific of pleasure or profit in the past." The priest, Father Ambrose, looked at the artist re- proachfully. "You forget in your censure that charity which suffereth long and is kind-you judge with man's weak and imperfect judgment, but you can not see these things as we do, so it were vain to reproach you. Edu- cation and prejudice have influenced your decision." "Father," said Hermann, addressing him thus for the first time, "I will at least give you the credit of being honest; you believe what you advocate-and it is not all who do-but of your own lips are condemned; there is no peace, therefore can be no true delight in your worship." "I did not mean, my friend, to assert the fact to which you have alluded without explanation. The fault is not in the religion, but in its devotee. My own heart contains the chaos which has never been called into order, but God can make it bloom like Eden. I am waiting watching for the blessed moment. Once washed in the sacred laver of regeneration, I had nearly thrown away the priceless gift of redemption; and it is the remnant of this error and crime still lirgerifig in rmy heart, which destroys its peace! But, as I said be,   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      61 fore, the past will be atoned; years of devotion, of fast- ing and penance will purchase immunity from future suffering." "But, father, forgive me, if I say there is apparent inconsistency (not hypocrisy) in this. You say you have abjured the world and all social ties, you wear the garb of a priest, ministering at the altar, and yet carry a forbidden image not only in your heart, but on this ivory! Why is this?" Father Ambrose turned deadly pale and walked away to the window, in order to conceal his agitation and to catch the reviving air. At length he turned upon Her- mann a countenance from whichevery vestige of color had fled, and answered mournfully, "Not a hypocrite! oh, no-an earnest seeker of that truth which so many have questioned, and which so few have found. Trust me, when I explain this matter to you, Which will be some day, apparent inconsistencies must be reconciled. But the subject is full of pain, and therefore unwelcome. Test this faith for yourself, and do not depend upon an- other; and to begin, go with me this evening, for we will insure both your life and safety." He did not wait for the reply, thereby affording no opportunity of denial, while the artist pursued his studies and his thoughts in silence. His labors had not been without their pleasant result; each day be- hleld him gaining strength and skill and resolution. That picture alone did not occupy his attention; he had commenced a copy of the Madonna. Circumstances combined in that land of poetry and romance, of flow- ers and music, of blue skies and glowing sunsets, to lead him astray from the faith of his fathers. He scarcely lived in the real world; all was vague, shadowy,   62        LILLIAN: OR, and ideal, but his mind possessed too much activity ever to relapse into the state of a dreamer; laboring indefatigably to attain the hight for which he sighed, and which to genius even is remote, and attainable only by the aid of untiring zeal and industry, and these are, perhaps, the best and safest gifts. But his friend's solicitations had not been in vain! Christmas eve, the great season of festivity in that Roman country, brought to his loneliness many images of the past-of his early home-for home he had none since his boy- hood-it existed only as a beatific vision, deep in his heart, embalmed with the forms which long since mold- ered in dust. He had never before witnessed such grand and ex- tensive preparations for any festival, and, therefore, resolved to gratify his own feelings, as well as his friend, by complying with his late request. A grow- ing attachment continued between them-they were both seeking happiness. The one convinced that it was to be found only in a spiritual life-but had not ob- tained it. The artist was divided between the desire of fame, vainly hoping that it might confer happiness, the glittering phantasm, which is sought by the mul- titude in various ways. Some- mistake pleasure for happiness, and plunge into excess; others float idly on the surface of the stream, grasping the weeds and flowers which grow on the banks-drifting onward with the current, reckless of the bourne to which they are insensibly but surely wafted. Father Ambrose secretly congratulated himself on the influence obtained over the artist. He had gained one point, evidenced by his friend's appearance at the Christmas fete, but: was yet far from accomplishing his aim. Let us do   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       63 father Ambrose justice-he was thoroughly honest, but fanatical! In his more serious moments, feeling strongly the inconsistency and futility of his religious tenets-but believed that the fault existed in himself, not in the religion he had adopted. The splendid Christmas fete, however, did not have the desired effect upon the mind of Travers. The music inspired him with a visionary enthusiasm-the incense floated around him in a mysterious cloud, while the gorgeous pageant of the Child Jesus, from his birth to his second coming, transfixed his eye with a dreamy wonder and a sort of religious awe, but there it ceased-the transport passed away. He was- standing by the little window, looking out upon the busy crowd below on that lovely Christmas morning, when the priest entered-his first words indi- cated the current of his feelings. "Still doubtful, still unsatisfied! I can read it in youT face and manner." "Then my feelings are already expressed-you have read correctly." He then proceeded to disclose his views with decision and earnestness. His handsome face was lighted up with the inspiration of the theme. Ardent feeling glowed and quivered in its every lineament, but failed to convince his friend. In the meantime, the picture grew life-like every day-each fresh stroke of the pencil brought outsome new charm. The finishing touch was given, and it was placed in the berft light for inspection and criticism. The priest surveyed it closely; at last he spoke in a tone of the deepest satisfaction. "It is perfect! perfect! 'oh, if you had but seen the fair 6   "        TTTTTAN: OR, original! those melting eyes! that shining hair! that gentle and winning smile, in fine all the ineffable graces of mind and face, which are hers? This coloring is vivid! only one thing now is wanting; a spark of Pro- methean fire to kindle it into life and being; with that we should hare the changing expression-now sweet and tender, now glowing and enthusiastic, or sad and pensive." It was well he could not see the artist's face, for he turned away during this rhapsody; but if he had not taken this precaution, the change would have been un- noticed. The priest's attention being pre-occupied and fascinated. Travers spoke-at last. "Does the soul correspond with the exterior? Are you sure that the casket contains a gem? Believe me, all beauty is not intrinsic-we must look beyond the surface, where enduring gifts abide. I have seen many a beautiful face, concealing a deformed spirit. Love must arise from the union of spirit with spirit, and if one be deformed, the other gradually will assimilate." "You speak like one who knows what it is to be deceived," said he, sharply, "for we learn only in these matters by experience!" Hermann colored, violently. "Forgive me," added the priest, "forgive me, if I have unconsciously touched a chord that jars. I spoke hastily, but not maliciously." "Let me ask you one question in return," said Tra- vers, "what will you do with this picture, now it is completed?" "I will place it among other choice paintings in my gallery, which you have never seen; and that reminds me of my negligence in not inviting you there. There   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      65 is no time like the present; already you look pale and drooping, the fresh air will invigorate you." Gladly availing himself of this relief from ardent application and consequent depression, the Father's invitation was 'accepted. The priest carried the pic- ture, with the face concealed, to prevent the scrutiny of passers. The route was entirely new to the artist, for he had constantly remained within the studio. They threaded their way through the narrow streets, which appeared interminable; but far down could be seen, as in perspective, meadows and fields, gay with many- colored flowers, waving in the soft breeze like a golden mist; small streams, clear as crystal, rippled and sung, while over them the blue heaven and earth blended their colors inja mute embrace. At last they emerged into the country. Every one has experienced the de- lightful exhilaration of change from the heat and bustle of a great thoroughfare to the sweet perfume; sights and sounds of the woodland. From the clash and clamor of busy life to the holy harmony of nature. Travers never felt this more keenly-he had been so long do- miciled with the creations of his own fancy and the wonders of art, that he needed the pure and glorious sunshine in his soul-the spray of the dashing water- fall, and the graceful flutter of the world without. There was no dwelling visible, but Father Ambrose assured him they were near their destination. "I have chosen this remote spot," said he, "because I believe one's life may be purer and holier passed in the sweet communion of Nature and her glories. For what is Nature but God?  It is He who painted the rose and gave the flowers their souls-which are their perfume. How can we seek Him more effectu-   "        LL'LIAN: OR, ally than in His great temple, not made with hands- His choir forever praising Him with harp and voice. At such times I have felt that yearning die from out my soul, and enjoyed something of the peace-so long wooed, so long withheld." "But do you not pervert these simple and natural forms of worship? Ostentatious and unmeaning, your rites are far above the common people, they can not appreciate them, and it is this very ignorance which holds them in bondage. They, we, all need something real, an anchor to the soul-a saving ark." "The Church is that ark!" "I believe it! but the Church, which and where is it? Let us faithfully examine, and prove what we may, till we find the stronghold for our affections and our faith." A sudden turn in the foot-path brought them to the house of the priest. It was an ancient building in the light Italian style of architecture; some parts had evidently fallen into decay and disuse, but had been rudely repaired. The old woman, housekeeper of the domicil, regarded the visitor with a keen and searching gaze-it was rarely they were honored with a visitor. Father Ambrose had not misrepresented-the gallery was situated in a wing which had been built expressly for that purpose, extended the entire length of the building, containing the most exquisite and choicest specimens of art. Travers could have lingered there frever. This opened into a library, well stored with antique tomes--writings of the fathers--elaborate ex- positions of Church tenets and Ecclesiastical history. The study was situated in the eastern wing; here were pictures of the Virgin and martyrs, a large wooden cru-   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      67 cifix, a representation of CEh-ist upon the cross, carved in stone; its aspect was sombre and unprepossessing; the small window being heavily draped, shutting out the sunlight, and substituting Roman candles, which then were burning. "' Here," said the priest, "I can exclude the world, tand commune in solitude with my own soul." "Inconsistent still!" replied Travers; "you love Nature, you deem her pure and holy, and yet exclude her blessed influences." "There are times," he replied, sternly, " when duty demands our entire presence, when we should look within," and he sighed audibly. "Remain with me this night, and in the morning I will show you the most- wonderful and picturesque scenery which the country affords." Hermann gladly accepted; he was charmed not only with the novelty of his situation, but with his host, who had never appeared to such advantage; his fund of knowledge seemed inexhaustible. Their simple repast was spread in the grove near by. The moon hung her silver lamp above them, shining through the trees, and a blessed serenity pervaded the scene. Are our hearts cold; or have they grown obtuse, that we do not notice as we did in youth, the refreshing change from day to night, from night to morning-from the severity of winter to the budding beauty of the spring, from the ex. panded glories of summer, to the melancholy softness and ripened beauty of autumn-the death of the year? They were silent long, memory and, hope whispering first to one and then' to the other, with every sigh of the leaves, with every gush of the fountain-faces look- ing down upon them with every ray of moonlight.   68         LILLIAN: OR, Father Ambrose broke silence: "My friend--let me always call you thus--there is a mystery connected with my life, to which that picture is the clue! I have never spoken of it to mortal man before; not even in my confessional. It is sacred to the past and can never be renewed. It is due to you, however, that I explain myself; you have kept the secret, and I need no fur- ther proof of your fidelity! Do not pity me! do not scorn!" Hermann did not lose a word. 4' Young and in the flush of an unclouded existence, I desired to visit the New World, the land of freedom! where men and opinions are unshackled! My mother, my only re- maining relative, sought to make me a priest-but re- ligion was far away--I did not need it-I did not de- sire it. I left her, my mother, with the promise of returning soon. Words can not express my feelings when I launched out upon the fathomless ocean-then first thoughts of the Infinite, the great I AM, filled my soul with awe. My expectations in that young and beautiful land were more than realized. I was mad with enthusiasm and delight. A message came from my mother; she wished me to return. I did not intend to slight her, but lingered, lingered still--then another! I did not heed it. At last she wrote imploringly; she was sick, she was dying! Awed by this startling ca- lamity, no time was lost then. I embarked upon the Queen of the Sea," he paused; -" there was a lady among the passengers, who drew my immediate and fascinated attention. In all my travels, I had never seen one half so beautiful. She captivated, enthralled me! It was a strange and dreamy fascination! and this lady was the wife of another ;" here his hands, which had been tightly pressed together, fell at his side with an expres-   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      69 sion of horror!"It- is her picture you have painted. We separated, and I shall never see her again! It is well! Upon my return, my mother had ceased to breathe; it was too late! too late! I wear this robe in accordance with her wishes. I have striven to ban- ish this image from my heart, but it is hard! She had married very young, and through the interposition of fri(ends and relatives, a man much older than herself, whom she did not love. By fasting and penance alone can this sitn be atoned. I believe her soul to be spot- less as yonder heaven'! but like me she was captivated. We loved wrongfully! we parted innocently! Tell me, should I be condemned?" Hermann Travers had listened with kindling -eye and burning cheek. The same woman had deceived them both! Again they were silent, Father Ambrose looking upon the ground, with a dejected and care-worn countenance.  "Listen to me, Sir Priest! I have known an artful and intriguing woman, who never loved, who profaned the word, attract the eye and fill the heart of -many a victim. Confidence begets confidence--you have told me your misfortune, I will tell you mine!" He then briefly recited the story of his love and dis- appointment. Father Ambrose had started to his feet and remained standing. The artist continued, "And this same woman, whom I trusted implicitly, married a waan much older than herself, but from choice," he spoke'with emphasis, "because her soul was sordid. I know nothing of her since-the past is like a dream to me-a painful dream! That woman was--you hold her picture!" "And her name?"   70        iLTT,TTAN: OR, "Florence Carroll, now Florence Moore." "The very same." Father Ambrose sank down and groaned aloud. "And this," he continued, vehemently, "was the cause of your agitation when you first saw the miniature?" "I had not obtained that self-control necessary to concealment. I painted her picture as the best oppor- tunity of acquiring it, and my heart is now steeled for- ever to her charms." Gradually he weaned the priest from his absorbing grief, by reverting to the past, by leading him away from the present unhappy theme--scattering the flow- ers of poetry along his discourse, painting the beautiful home of his youth in fairy-like colors; but there was no allusion made to the little flower girl-why was her name unmentioned? Ah! her memory was sacred! Hour after hour passed-swiftly away, till Father Ambrose hurriedly arose and exclaimed, "We forget I it is already past the time of my evening orisons--you may slumber, but I can not--you are innocent, but I feel a new weight of guilt within my tortured bosom! let us retire." Travers felt that his words and gestures were sig- nificant. "What avails," said he, " the one great Sa- crifice, if man may atone for his own guilt? Infinite suffering and misery are lost-they are superfluous." "But," said the priest, solemnly, "he who suffers with Him shall also reign with Him. Conscience and our well being demand it." By this time they had reached the tidy and com- fortable apartment designated to his friend. "Where will you rest?" said Hermann. "Rest! rest! Do you not know, my friend, that   TIIE BATTLE OF LIFE.      71 sleep is like the world?--' the wretched it forsakes- swift on its downy pinions flies-and lights on lids un- sullied with a tear! ' ' It might have been imagination, but Travers thought that he heard sighs and moans at intervals until dawn. Once he arose and walked to the window-he discerned some object lying on the ground, but the moon was hidden by a cloud. Soon it emerged, showing the prostrate figure distinctly--it was Father Ambrose- in his hand he held an instrument of torture, self- inflicted. His first impulse was'to rush out and raise him from the ground, and persuade him to seek his couch, but the fear of giving offense restrained him. "Miserable fanatic," said he, aloud, " can heaven be propitiated by such penance? Ah, he is mad! either bent on self-destruction or some other crime." But the bright moon shining down on that mild, pale face, quivering with intense pain, belied his words. Excited and troubled, he returned to his pillow, but not to sleep. Sunrise in -that country is sublime! The painter, the poet can not describe it--a few timid tints flush the horizon, they deepen and others unite softly, harmoniously-there is no' discordant coloring there. Then the purple and red and amber glow like fire, till the heavens present a burning blaze. They open a pathway for the great Sun King, rolling under his chariot wheels noiselessly, and fading gradually into the primal tints. It was new and grand to,Hermann; upon descending he found his friend had preceded him--he was unusually pale and calm. The. matin meal was partaken silently. ' Come with me, now," said the priest, " and look upon the scenery of whch I have told ytmu."   72        LILLIAN; OR, It was commanded by a northern window. There they looked out upon the Alps! the grand, old Alps, over which an invading army crossed more than two thousand years ago; over which myriads of echoes re- verberated the joyful shouts, as the fertile fields and vales of Italy burst, upon their vision. White with snow, in some places verdant and blooming with the Alpine rose, violet and wild anemone. But the gem of the landscape was a little valley in the embrace of these everlasting hills. The peasants, at that early hour in the morning, were flitting about at their simple and pious duties. The smoke from their dwellings, or huts, ascended in light and graceful wreaths. There was one old man toiling up the steep ascent, aided by his staff; his long, gray locks floated on the breeze, and his form was bowed with age and infirmity. "Behold the hermit of the Alps-a godly man-a priest-a saint. He has shrived many a soul-his prayers ascend continually to heaven; let us lose no time in seeking his admonition and intercession." "The day is wearing away," replied Hermann, " and I must return to my studio-it is like going back to the wilderness after the refreshing glimpse of the pro- mised land; this delightful visit, that charming land- scape can never be forgotten." Hermann. desired, but dared not refer to the scene be had witnessed on the preceding night; he knew that all arguments were futile to effect any change in the fanatical life of the priest, and therefore trusted to time and a gradual influence to overcome these austeri- ties. They were now bound by a new tie-that of common misfortune-it was with them a strange coin- cidence. The one was not likely to forget the other.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       73 CHAPTER VL. THE friend of Lillian was true-she did not forsake them in their great need-it was arranged that both should remain there at present. Eva, at Lillian's earnest intercession, to be adopted as her own, and the latter donated to Florence, if her consent could be ob- tained. "Let us go back to the old cottage once more," said Lillian, her mournful eyes filling with tears, " it has been so long a home to me, and I have not yet said good by." "We will go in the carriage," replied the lady; "I wish to have a settlement with your housekeeper, to elicit from her some clue to your father's whereabouts. I can not believe that he has willfully forsaken you." "My dear father has not forsaken us, I will never believe it!" She then proceeded tearfully to give an account of his tender and loving farewell-of his kind words and counsels--of his grief at being thrown out of employ- ment, and, all the minutae connected with her sad and suffering life. For who can say that she had not spf- fered? more perhaps than many others during twenty or thirty years, from her acute perceptions, from her sensitive and delicate temperament. The death of her mother, and subsequent departure of the surviving pa- rent--her fears concerning his safety-and the cruelty of aunt Margaret-these had been deep sources of af-   74         LILLIAN: OR, fliction. She concluded her narrative, while the tender heart of her friend overflowed in tears. "Poor little sufferer," said she, " you shall not again be exposed to the tyranny and malice of one who has abused her power. If you love me, you will also soon learn to love my daughter." * "Oh, madame, if she is like you, I shall love her dearly," replied Lillian, in a voice of the deepest emo- tion. Mrs. Carroll felt this delicate tribute, and she re- solved that it should be kept alive in -the heart of the little Flower Girl. She should remain, then, until Eva became accustomed to her new home, and its delight- ful surroundings. She had to be won by many little arts and kindnesses, because the severe treatment she had received, rendered her shy and suspicious. At- tired in the new dress, provided by her friend, her beauty struck the beholder at once-and every one ex- claimed, what a lovely child! "Indeed, Mrs. Carroll, you have found a prize." The thought of envy never occurred to Lillian, or that all which was bestowed upon her sister might have been hers, if she had accepted; it filled her with a secret joy; and at night, when no eye perceived but the Great Omnipresent, she gave thanks that they were safely anchored from the storms and sorrows of life--and especially that Eva would henceforth be shielded from the evil devices of mankind. In latter years she dis- covered that wealth was no safeguard to happiness; that it is vain to rest on mortal promises and mortal hopes. "A- broken reed at best, But oft a spear."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       75 TIhe light snow and frost-work which had covered the earth, melted away on one of those bright days which look in-upon winter, giving a foretaste of the genial spring time. Mrs-. Carroll made known to Lil- lian her intention of visiting the cottage. 'A maiden aunt, who had resided' with Mrs. Carroll for many years, and possessing the peculiaritic z of that unfortu- nate class, had waged a petty warfer, with her relative, on the adoption of the little orpha;.a.  She had said re- peatedly, "There is no accounting for 3 our taste, Clara; what do you see to admire and love in that young hypo- crite," referring to Lillian. a Do not speak of her in that way; at least, not in her presence," replied Mrs. Carroll. "Just as I thought," said she, bursting into tears, "just as I thought; they will supersede your own blood relations. "I have done you no harm, my dear aunt," replied the lady; "you shall neither be neglected nor super- seded." "There it is again," said the unhappy woman," "al- ways taunting me with my dependence." Mrs. Carroll made no reply, but bit her lips and colored with vexation. "Come, Lillian, the carriage is waiting, and Eva must go, too; perhaps it would, be a pleasure to you both, once more." "Shall Eva and I go away?" said Lillian, quite dis- tressed at the little episode she had witnessed. "Yes,  gogo," replied aunt Betsey, you have no right here "' i "Remember, aunt," Mrs. Carroll spoke mildly, but 1,            ,   76         LILLIAN: OR, decidedly, "remember, I am mistress-these children are mine." "I knew it-I knew it--when I first saw their baby faces and their soft, easy and insinuating manners!- It is not now, 'Come, Aunt Betsey, let us go and ride,' but' Lillian and Eva, the carriage is ready.' Some people will persist in exchanging old friends for new ones." "'I thought, Betsey, you would not be interested in our drive, but there is plenty of room if you desire to go with us." "No, I do not," she answered, angrily, and with of- fended dignity swept from the room; but the children were more surprised than delighted when in a few mo- ments she returned ready for the drive, seating herself in the carriage, vigorously using a large fan. Mrs. Carroll only smiled, for she knew her aunt's peculiari- ties, and allowed her to relapse into silence. Aunt Betsey's presence detracted much from the luxury of the drive. The carriage top was thrown back to ad- mit the warm and gentle sunshine, and nothing along the road was lost to the observant eye of Lillian. The motion of the carriage and the reviving look of nature soothed her into a delightful dream. At last, forget- ting the stately figure which sat opposite to her, she started to her feet, and clasping her hands, exclaimed: "There it is! there it is!-my dear, dear home!" "Can't you make that child sit down? Quite a scene in public!" she added, sarcastically. "And is that it?" said Mrs. Carroll; "that white cottage among the trees. It was a pretty home." "Yes! there is my own little garden," (her tone was sad); and, oh! there is Aunt Margaret standing in the   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       " door. Do not go very near her, my dear lady, she is violent at times." Mrs. Carroll laughed. "We need have no fears of her now, my darlings; you are under my protection, and she can not injure you." Eva had nestled closely to Lillian, and taken her hand, while the latter turned pale at sight of her tor- mentor.  The carriage stopped and they alighted, aunt Betsey following, glancing defiance on the flushed and angry Margaret. "Ah, here you come, you little vixens!" were the first words of the latter, " let me get hold of you once." Lillian and Eva drew nearer their friend. "Remember, you are in the presence of your supe- riors," said Betsey, haughtily. "Shame ought to keep you silent-how have you treated these poor little in- nocents committed to your care? It is a fine thing that you will never have the second opportunity." "What have you been saying about me?" asked Margaret, angrily. "Not one of you shall enter this cottage; I am mistress here!' "But we must," said Mrs. Carroll, mildly. "You have not the power to prevent. By your acts you have dissolved the relation to them which you held. If I were to tell you that these children are now mine, you would then perceive that you had no claim upon them." "Do not go very near her," whispered Lillian, " she is angry." "What do you say of me? No, you shall not enter here!" and she glanced defiance at the little group-   78        LILLIAN: OR, a picture worthy the artist's pencil. In the foreground stood aunt Margaret and aunt Betsey-both evidently desiring the quarrel, which seemed to be inevitable. The milder Mrs. Corroll, a little aside-her tactics be- ing: to mollify or overawe; and in the background, hand in hand, pale and trembling like culprits, stood Lillian and Eva, the innocent cause of all this debate and anger. Quick as thought, aunt Betsey pushed aside her antagonist, waving her hand majestically and authoritatively to the group, bidding them advance; they did so, timidly, under cover of the enemy's fire. "Poor satisfaction you will find here--an empty house, and it contains no secrets." It was true, every vestige of furniture had been re- moved, either sold, stolen or destroyed-nothing re- mained but the bright parlor carpet, which had always been Lillian's especial admiration. Aunt Margaret followed them about from room to room, giving utter- ance to her anger, in hasty and insulting words. "What does all this mean?" said Mrs. Carroll, turn- ing to Lillian; 1"the house was not thus desolate when fyou left it?" "Rosebrdugh is never coming back," said the old woman, " and I had to sell what I could find to pay for my trouble and expense with his ungrateful girls." She shook her fist menacingly at Lillian. "How do you know he is not coming back? Has he written to that effect?" Mrs. Carroll vainly hoped to elicit some information which would be of value to the orphans. "He has'nt wrote at all." "When did you receive his last letter?" "No use in quizzing me^" said she. with a sneer.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      79 "The man went away last July, and all the money he has sent home, to keep those ill-begotten children, is twenty dollars!" Mrs. Carroll perceived the inconsistency of her state- ment. He had been gone five months-and that amount would scarcely have provided them with bread; then theire were wood, lights, and many other contingent expenses. i' You have his address?" said she. "His name was Peter Rosebrough!"The reply was shrewd and evasive. "But where is he now?" asked Mrs. Carroll, mildly. "'I don't think he knows' himself; moved away likely." "But when he wrote last? I will pay you hand- somely for any information on the subject." "Didn't say." Aunt Betsey's patience was exhausted. "Have her up before the justice, and make her an- swer you civilly." "A pretty lady you are, in your fine clothes, come to insult an honest woman like me! I can tell you, madame,' fine feathers don't always make fine birds,' and especially of old ones; ' and she laughed, deri- sively. There was nothing upon which the maiden aunt felt more sensibly than upon the matter of her age. She had been twenty-five, twice that number of years, but often remarked to others tha't she looked much older than she really was. One could never judge from ap- pearances. Turning to her neice, she said, haughtily. "If you choose to stand talking with this ill-bred creature, you can: it is enough to know how she has   80        LILLTTAN: OR, abused these poor, dear innocents, and robbed them of everything. It is of no use to bandy words with her in the cold-let us be going." "What do you mean?" said Margaret, going straight to her, and shaking her fist in her face; " what do you mean be calling me such names?" This was too pugilistic, even for her antagonist, who retreated, followed and pressed by the demon she had so rashy aroused-making plunges and dashes at her elegant new hat, with her fist-till it was bruised and bent in every imaginable shape. - Mrs. Carroll saw that it was useless to prolong the scene, and went out with Lillian and Eva. The former weeping bitterly. "Why do you weep, my child?" said Mrs. Carroll, tenderly. "The beautiful white apple blossoms, and the peach trees will soon be out-my lilacs are already budded, and the snow has melted from my garden, but I shall not watch its summer beauty, nor gather roses in it any more. Papa sat on that bank with Eva, while I gathered a bouquet for him, before he went away; and there is the little church, and the grave of my mother. It is very desolate." Mrs. Carroll put her arms about her, and drew her gently away. "Oh, why did papa ever leave us? I feared he would never come back! I told him so! We are all alone now-alone in the world!" Mrs. Carroll soothed her with a soft caress, and led her to the carriage. But poor Aunt Betsey had an- ticipated their arrival, with antagonistic demonstra- tions. "A pretty sight I am! a pretty sight! comes of vis-   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      81 iting places and people like these; they will be expen- sive enough to you yet! Mark my words!" Despite the sympathy she really felt, Mrs. Carroll could not restrain a smile at the ludicrous appearance of her aunt, who reclined languidly on a cushion of the carriage, evidently exhausted, by her efforts. Her bon- net gave signs of a heavy battle, and the bird of Para- dise, with which it had been ornamented, had lost its delicate and graceful plumage. Mrs. Carroll quietly replied, "Never mind the accident, you shall have a new hat-so do not mourn over this." Their ride home was quiet and thoughtful. Mrs. Carroll endeavoring to fix upon some plan by which she could obtain information of Mr. Rosebrough, se- cretly resolving that she should never withdraw her protection and care over the orphans, even if their father returned. She believed Lillian to be a remarkable child, and that her gifts ought to be cultivated.- She had now no object upon which to lavish her tenderness, and love, but her need was supplied. Eva was a model of beauty, and susceptible of high cultivation. Aunt Betsey was devising a new pattern for a hat, while Lillian shed silent tears over the memories which thronged her mind. She had strained her eyes looking back-back upon the dear home now receding. Every spot was sacred to the memory of her childhood-there her mother had smiled upon her--had counseled her- had taught her the holy hope which burned steadily in her bosom-there she had bidden her farewell-now sleeping-sleeping-above her grave the summer birds would sing and flutter and build their nests-above her grave the flowers would bend in silent reverence of the sacred dust, and the stream would murmur, while all   82        LILLIAN: OR, she had loved were far away. Oh, it is hard to leave our darling -ones, our bosom friends, in the slumber that knows no waking-in the silence unbroken by human voice. But look not to the present, ye who mourn! the radiant future comes, with trumpet sound, and the graves restore their dead, and those who sleep arise! Think of this! On the ensuing week Lillian was to be separated from Eva; to part with her who had proven her best earthly friend, and to -enter upon new scenes and new associations; but the residence of Mr. Moore was not lfar away, as he had chosen the location in accordance with Mrs. Carroll's request, that she might be near her daughter; not wishing to resign all claim upon her love. This arrangement was satisfactory to Moore, as he knew well the influence exerted by this lovely and amiable woman was of the most exalted character. It failed, however, to inspire her daughter with right and truthful sentiments. Life to her was made for pleasure, and pleasure was to be obtained in the pursuance of her vain and foolish projects. Moore had relapsed into gloomy silence, feeding the fire within his breast, gradu- ally consuming his hopes; leaving him bitter and un- happy. He offered no new garlands at the shrine of the goddess who had deceived him, and those already wreathed upon her altar drooped and faded, uncared for in the night of his disappointment. Stately, and yet cold-glittering, and yet hollow-their home and posi- tion were unenviable. Lillian had been surprised at the elegance displayed in her friend's mansion, she saw now that it could not compare with the magnificence here exhibited. Florence did not speak unkindly to her; in fact, she heeded her   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       83 not, and this cold indifference was more chilling than the irritability which had been displayed by Aunt Bet- sey, whose parting salutation was characteristic. "I hope you will behave more becomingly in your new home than you have with us!" If Lillian had been a flashy, brilliant child, she would have recommended herself more freely to the taste and consideration of Aunt Betsey; it was new to her, this quiet surprise, the averted :face and tearful eye; they irritated her with their reproachfulness, and she failed- to perceive under all this silent demeanor the wealth of feeling, the intrinsic merit concealed in that young heart-forgetting that deep waters are voiceless. But Lillian rightly conceived that Eva would be safe from her petty annoyance after her departure-she already regarded the little creature with something- like, tender- ness-and Eva, she said to herself, consolingly, would never prove unworthy, but develop brighter and more winning traits every day. The room assigned to her in this elegant mansion was perhaps more simple than any other, opening within into Mrs. Moore's- private apartment, and out upon a verandah, which overlooked in summer time, the gaiy parterre and aviary. The Brussel's carpet represented an emerald ground, covered with diamonds of gold and bouquets of roses. A rose-wood dressing-case, with-a marble top, and a small, light: mirror, suspended} by a crimson cord and tassel. A little bed, with its snowy covering, stood opposite..the window, where she could catch the first rays of the morning sun, or look out upon the blue sky and the clear, pale moon..    x 1: ' My dear madame," said she, turning to Mrs,-Car- roll, who had accompanied her up stairs, "how very   84         TTLLLTTAN': OR, good and kind you are. I can not thank you. Only tell me what to do in return for all this generosity, and I shall feel relieved." She had placed her hand upon her heart, and spoke in a tone of the deepest gratitude and reverence. "Only prove yourself worthy of our love," and kiss- ing her good-night, went away with Eva, and she was alone. "Prove myself worthy! I think it can never be. Oh, if mamma and papa could only know, could only see us now." It may be her mother saw her then, even when she desired her presence, a silent participator in her joy! Overcome with fatigue incident to the excitement of the day, Lillian was soon asleep. It was not long, however, before she was awakened by voices which sounded very near, in loud and angry altercation. Her first impulse was to spring from the bed in terror, but a gleam of light shining from an adjoining room gave her courage; she thought also the voices came from that direction. "You shall not go," said one, that she recognized as Moore; "we have had enough already of these foolish balls and fancy parties! you shall not go." "But I tell you," said another, scornfully, "that you have not the power to restrict my conduct. I have promised to go, and really believe I shall!" "Well; let us see, then, in which party the power is really vested; judges, juries and courts assign it to the husband. Try, madame!" Lillian could distinctly hear no more. A door was violently closed, there were sounds of retreating foot- steps, the light was extinguished, and the darkness, to-   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      85 gether with the strange sounds she had heard, filled her with intense fear. She had lain thus, listening, striving to peer through the blackness, counting the regular tick of the little French clock which stood on the marble mantle, when the outer door softly opened, and some one entered; she could not tell who nor what, but the figure paused near the bed. Lillian suppressed even her breathing, and it then glided away and kneel- ing down before the inner door, which led to Mrs. Moore's private apartment, remained motionless-it seemed an interminable length of time to Lillian-but the clock, more reliably, meted out the half of an hour. It then arose and disappeared noiselessly in the same manner. With an acute fear of the supernatural, so common to childhood, Lillian could only account for this appearance at such a time as an evil spirit, clothed in darkness: but her mother's teachings, together with recent experience, disproved such belief; but she could not sleep again, tossing on her pillow, which had pro- mised such downy repose, till, from sheer exhaustion, she fell asleep just before the morning broke; her slum- bers were consequently heavy and prolonged. She was awakened by the breakfast bell, and bounding out of bed saw by the clock that it was already nine; per- forming her toilette carefully, and reviewing the night's events, it appeared like a dream, only there was certain evidence to corroborate their reality-the door which she remembered was closed upon Mrs. Carroll's de- parture, now stood partially open. A chair, nearby, had been moved from its place, and Lillian hastened down to disclose the mystery, in order that it might be unraveled. There was not a word spoken by any one; at last she ventured to break the silence.   86       -LILLIAN: O01, "IMrs. Moore, are there burglars in this city?" Mr. Moore started and looked at her sternly, but be- ing honest she did not understand the glance. "I do not think there are. But why do you ask?" Moore became uneasy, striving to catch the eye of Lillian. "Because, ma'am, some one certainly came into my room last night, and frightened me so that I could not go to sleep again." "Lillian," said he, sternly, and with authority, "never repeat such idle fancies in my presence. I thought you were too womanly." "Do not be angry, sir, but it is true." "I think you must have dreamed about burglars," said Florence, with a light laugh. Lillian finding that no one had any sympathy for her, and that they scarcely credited the story, did not press the subject any further, but turned it over and over, unsatisfac- torily, in her own mind. That day she was going to school, but it was deferred until afternoon, as the morn- ing was so nearly spent. The few hours until noon were passed in examining the handsome pictures that ornamented the paneling of her room. There was one representation of the Swiss Alps; this had been her favorite dream, even when she was younger, and the tall walls of- snow on both sides of the path that led from their cottage to the gate, when flushed with sun- set, resembled them in her imagination. There was another, of a little girl standing. at the meadow gate, beautiful and rustic, shading her face with her hand and gazing down the lane, apparently after some be- loved image, no longer visible. "Perhaps it was her father," said Lillian, audibly.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       87 "Do you love pictures, Lillian?" inquired a voice near her, and on turning she beheld Moore standing in the door, where he had been watching her, unaware of his presence. "Oh, yes, sir," replied she, "I am never weary look- ing at them. :Do you see -that little girl?" and she pointed to the picture she had been examining, " so sweet and sad-perhaps she was an orphan." Moore's face showed the sympathy which he truly felt. He entered and seated himself beside Lillian- there he drew from her an account of her early history, listening gently and with interest; for this lonely child had excited his pity and tenderness. He believed her to be true-what his wife was not; an honest heart- refined and delicate sentiments were richly supplied in the little Flower Girl. This, his penetration had discovered on her introduction to their domicil, and he liked her for this reason, if none other. If she proved his judgment sound, she should always have a place in his home and affections. Gradually the conversation, by some chance, turned upon the last night's mystery. Moore questioned her seriously, looking in her face all the time, to read her thoughts ar her suspicions. "Have you any idea who this person was?" "No, sir, I could not see, it was very dark." "Well," said he, with evident relief,* "be assured that you are perfectly safe in my house-burglars can not enter it, and there are no ghosts-therefore you can sleep quietly and without fear. But if you desire to please me, never mention this subject again." At this moment they were summoned to dinner, and they descended the stairs together; Moore with a lighter heart than had beaten in his bosom-since his 8    88        LILLIAN: OR, unfortune marriage. He had now some one to love, who would return his love-if she only remained thus simple and artless-thus truthful, it would repay him. "You have been cultivating Lillian's acquaintance I perceive," said Mrs. Moore, scornfully, "doubtlesi you find her congenial." "( Truth, intelligence and gentleness are always agree- able to me, madame," was the reply. Florence changed color, angrily, but did not deign to speak again. This seemed cold and unhappy to Lillian-having never heard an unkind word betwixt her own parents-nor seen an unkind action. This state of things was in- comprehensible. Of the two she much preferred Moore, and believed that in time she should regard him with sincere and eafhest affection. But she soon discovered that this was a house of mystery. Returning from school one day, she found a locket lying on the hall floor,. and lost no time in restoring it to its rightful 6- :  -;-. .   ;ig a  drawing-room, where she found Moore and his wife alone, but the former being nearest the door, received the lost treasure. Florence sprang eagerly forward to take it from him, but with a- firms hand and stern countenance he, re- strained her; and touching the spring, it flew open, revealing the figure of a foreigner-a tall, dark man- handsome and noble-by his features, an Italian. Moore look first at the miniature, then at his wife-at last he said: "Whatf friend is this whom you prize so highly; there is a striking rii esemblance between this face and the stranger on the ship, who paid you so much atten- tion."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       89 Florence could not answer; fear, anger and shame alternated in her bosom, and on her countenance. "If you have inspected it sufficiently, perhaps you can restore it to its rightful owner," said she, at last. "Madame, I have told you once, that if you do not love me, you shall respect me; I will be obeyed!" "What would you have me do, "sacid she; "if a gen- tleman chooses to give me his miniature, shall I refuse it?" "Send him to me, if you feel delicate in the matter. Now you know that Ihave no such hesitation in say- ing what is right and wrong; you might -appoint me arbiter," he replied, looking at her scornfully. "Give me the likeness, Mr. Moore, -and I will do so after this. "Florence," said he sternly, "when did you ever tell me the truth? Not since you perjured yourself at the altar. Tempt me no more-it is beyond endur- ance." And he placed the locket under his heel, and crushed it to atoms. She rose, and with a stately tread left the apartment, but paused in the door, and turning to him, said menacingly and bitterly: "Alfred -Moore, you shall repent this deed! Think not, because I am a woman, you can trample. on my feelings and my rights, while- I have a father's house near by, and powerful friends," He made her no reply, but white as a statue, leaned his head upon his hand, lost in sad and scornful re- flections.           . "  Was life," thought he," always to be a terrible struggle for supremacy; there was no rule of love-no rule of right to influence his misguided wife--there was   90        LTLT TAN: OR, no end to the troubles incident to his fatal choice; but regrets were unavailing- it was fixed and unalter- able." Lillian had stood wonderingly and timidly trying to understand the ground of offense and defense. At last she approached him and said, timidly: "Can I do anything for you, Mr. Moore?" her little hand was gently laid on his, and her soft gray eyes beamed with an expression of sympathy and affection. "No one can do anything for me, Lillian. But what do you think I need? There is nothing which money will not purchase--and I have that at my com- mand. It will purchase all but one thing-can you tell me what it is?" "I know, sir, that money does not always make us happy, for I have been told so many times. Oh, sir, it can not be bought-it is a gift." He looked at her in amazement. "Where can it be found, Lillian, who is the giver?" " God." He dropped his head again and remained lost in thought. He had lived many years, but never had this subject been presented to his mind so strikingly before; and this poor, neglected child had found that happi- ness, which he had sought so vainly and so wearily. "But, sir," said she, after a moment's pause, " the miniature was Mrs. Moore's-ought you not to have returned it to her?" "You can not understand this matter, my child, and I hope you never will. Oh, if there be anything lovely and priceless in a woman's character, it is truth and ingenuousness. If you live with me, Lillian, which I   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       91 mean you shall, you can be my teacher, and I will compensate you as best I can. Do you love music?" "I can not tell ypu how much I love music," she re- plied, " and flowers, and the stars and the birds; every- thing that is beautiful!" "Because your own heart is pure, and responds to the voice of nature. Would you like to receive musical instruction?" "I should love it dearly, sir." "You shall be gratified. Go and leave me alone now for a while." Lillian ran quickly- up stairs, and taking off her wrappings, was soon lost in the study of the little his- tory upon which she had just entered. She was in- tensely occupied when Mrs. Moore entered the room, flushed and angry. "This is a good return for all my kindness, is it not?  You knew very well that the locket belonged to me; then why did you give it to my  husband," said she, sharply. "I did not know that it made any difference," she replied, timidly; Mr. Moore was nearest the door, and so I handed it to him." "You are a   thoughtless, ungrateful child; I hope you will never repeat the offense."   :'- "I   would not have given it to him at all, had I known that you wished me  not to do so. Please for- give me this time." Mrs. Moore was considerably softened by the peni- tence of the innocent girl. "But," added she, "papa and mamma never cared." '"Different positions in life, bring different duties and Aids   92       ,/LLLIAN: OR, responsibilities; your parents were poor, and conse- quently were everything to each other." s^  iimptly. : would prefer being poor," said Lillian, simply*.  "You will probably have your choice," was the sar- castic reply, " but remember, if ever you find anything again, which you now I have lost, restore it to its rightful owner, and prevent further trouble." "Believe me, I wil do so." And so the unhappy conversation ended. If Lillian had been mystified at the strange appearance in her room, she was equally so at the painful scene: just en- acted.         Why was she always thy innocent cause of so much suffering? It really appealed to her keenly sensitive mind, that she was incapable of a single good action. She had intended to be honest and truthful. She had made both of her friends angry and unhappy; possibly she might learn some time t odo justice to all, and so dismissing the painful subject from her mind, resolv- ed, in the gratitude of her heart, to leave no effort untried for the promotion of their happiness, and her own improvement. Her father' could never be forgot- ten-nor had she ceased to lie awake at night, and pic- ture to herself the battle-field, and her beloved one wounded, sick, dead or dying-but these fancies filled her mind with terror, and she strove to banish them. There resides some terrible power in the imagina- tion, unless continually under the supremacy of the rightful authority-reason!-the power to torture and annoy. So when we are separated from friends whom we prize, there is a constant fear for their welfare and happiness. Perhaps it is a want of faith which in-   THE -BATTLE OP LIFE.       93 duces this fear; for an unshaken trust in the govern- ment of One who loves us, is a safeguard. But in the case of our little heroine there was great cause for the uneasiness-indeed, she might almost mourn her father as lost forever. -If he were living, there was some mys- tery connected with his silence which was fearful. And often thoughts- of Margaret's strange conduct when they- last visited -the cottage, awakened the strongest suspicions of her honesty; certainly she had no right todispose of her father's property in that way.  But Mrs. Corroll had informed her that the few articles re- maining were to be taken care of in some legal man- ner, and there was no bringing back the past, so that subject also was dismissed. She had received the promise from Mrs. Moore of visiting Eva on the fol- lowing Saturday--this was a pleasant anticipation- her friend withheld nothing from- her, which would ben- efit or gratify her, much to the discomfort of Florence, who regarded the little Flower Girl in the light of- an usurper. - But she had shut herself willfully out of his heart; forgetting, that some object would certainly oc- cupy the place which she refused to fill. Little did she dream that the few words uttered by that child, in her simplicity, had let in a gleam of light upon his soul, so weary and darkened, for which he could never cease to bless her. Our influence upon the- lives- of others is too lightly estimated; a word, a smile or a glance may touch a chord, which -shall vibrate through the whole harmony of being-either tunefully or discordantly; and, if upon one life, through a succession of lives, from one to another -" for no one liveth to himself- nor dieth to himself."   "        LILLIAN: OR. CHAPTER VII. THE regiment to which Rosebrough belonged had been ordered to the southern coast. The new life upon which he entered roused the faculties so long dormant; its constant activity, change of scene, and all the ex- citement incident to military campaigns, inspired him with something like patriotism. The delightful'and varied scenery everywhere presented to his view was not lost upon him; it was treasured up for the enter- tainment of Lillian. Their dear faces pursued him everywhere, as they stood at the gate, watching his de- parture, or flitting through the garden, gathering flow- ers. He had received Lillian's answer to his first let- ter, and there the correspondence between them ceased, but was kept up by Margaret, who appropriated both his letters and remittances; always replying promptly and painting their home, with its comforts and plea- sures, in as glowing language as she could command. Lillian was so busy, said she, with her school and other avocations, that she had no time to answer this letter, but would not omit the first opporunity to write. This modified his disappointment and created hopes, again to be dashed to the ground. It had been his resolution from the first to visit them by surprise, about the time of the holidays, but it proved impracticable, and there- fore was deferred until the spring campaign. In the meantime they had recaptured the Florida forts, and proved an efficient corps of government troops; they   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      95 had planted the stars and stripes in the enemy's couna try, carrying terror and defeat to all who opposed them. Elegant residences, adorned with everything that could render them luxurious, were abandoned, de- spoiled of their costly furniture, and left a prey to the conquering enemy. Rosebrough had reserved many relics, not for his own benefit, but for the gratification  of his little ones. Christmas, hailed so joyfully by young and old, in every country and clime, brought to the home-sick parent many sweet but mournful remem- brances of the past, and as he sat idly pondering these things in his mind, he was carried back, as by a magi- cian's wand, to the little cottage and all its blessed as- sociations. The flame from the open fireplace leaped up with a grateful warmth, diffusing its brightness over the little group. The spirit of his sainted wife was there, not visibly, but among the shadows, shedding a mild and benignant influence over the family circle. There was Lillian, a child, thoughtful and serene as a woman, and the beautiful Eva in her life's young spring; how dear, doubly dear, were they all now that he could not see them, now that he could not hear their loving and familiar voices. -And he hoped that in that domi- cil Margaret was beloved and respected, had somewhat supplied the vacant place, counseling and guiding his orphan children; and what rendered the picture more agreeable, was the feeling that his own exertions hadt procured this comfortable living for the dear ones- now Lillian could gratify her literary tastes, and her talents could be cultivated and made to shine with the lustre of the diamond. What a contrast to the living picture on that memorable night! But his head drooped lower and lower on his bosom, and: from musing he fell 9   96        LILLIAN: OR, into dreams; but the troubled dreams which take their coloring even from a distant reality. It was very still in the cottage, and the snow lay not as in former times in walls on either side of the path, but in large and spotless drifts under the window, through the garden and by the low fence. The blinds were all closed, and no footprints to mar the solemn whiteness of the scene; Even those made-by Lillian and Eva on their flight had been effaced. The silence and desolation were ominous: he lifted the latch and entered-there was no bright fire, no voices to welcome him, but over the few smoul- dering embers sat two women, one of whom he recog- nized as Margaret, her face red and bloated, and the smell of spirits pervading the atmosphere. "Yes, I can manage it," said she with a laugh, " now we are rid of those graceless imps; sell the furniture, and appropriate the proceeds, as I have done the re- mittances ;" and drawing the purse from her pocket, she emptied out the shining contents, partly in gold, and partly in government notes. These she counted, and recounted, seemingly with great effort. "Full one hundred dollars," said she, with a chuckle, "and there is no doubt he will continue to send. I can keep him in the dark-I can play my cards to good advantage." "But what do you think has become of the young ones?" "Little I care-they will be no expense now, and Margaret the better off. That Lillian is a shrewd one, she will provide for herself and her sister anywhere!" "But she is pretty young yet to look far ahead; be careful, old woman, or your secret will be discovered. What are you going to give me for sharing the burden and advising you in the matter?"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       97 Margaret gave a low laugh, and replied sarcastically, "What do you think your services are worth?" "At least the half of your profits!" She was answered with a fearful oath, "I do n't be- lieve you will get any ;" and the purse was returned to her pocket. "i You had better buy your safety and liberty. I be- lieve it would be state's prison offens " said the other, maliciously. "Come, do not be so hard on me. I will give you five dollars; you know we have always been friends, and I run the risk, while you are in no danger." "Friends!" replied she, curtly, "I never had any- never expect to have," a shade of softness passed over her-rigid features; " but I want money-that's the best friend." "You shall have ten dollars-wont that do?" "We can't agree," and she arose to depart. Margaret groaned aloud. "You shall have twenty, and not another penny will I add to it--you are greedy and selfish." "I will not touch a penny of your ill-gotten money; depend on it, you will fare the worse for your wicked- ness and theft." Hard words passed between them, spiced with oaths- and the most fearful denunciations. Blows seemed in- evitable, when the last light from the embers died out suddenly-darkness enveloped the cottage and its mis- erable inmates. The scene became changed-upon the old familiar site stood a palace-or a dwelling elegant and luxurious as the fabled palaces of fairy land. There were music and feasting and rejoicing. It was a Christmas festival, wreaths of evergreens ornamented   98        LILLIAN; OR, the costly paintings, festooned the chandliers, and a tree hung with toys, and gifts of every description, glittering with innumerable lights, while the remainder of the room was in darkness, gave a grand and de- lightful effect. By and by the door opened, and a band of merry children burst in full of glee, laughing, shout- ing in innocent expectation. Lillian and Eva followed closely, but silently. They were not clad simply, but becoming their new position. And the beautiful lady, enchantress of the scene, held Eva by the hand-they were pale and care-worn, those darlings, and his heart yearned over them in his dream, with all the tender- ness of an absent father. But they were not forgotten in the eager distribution of gifts; to Eva was awarded a doll, in its light, gossamer dress and gayly-colored ribbons-to Lillian, a book! Were they not appro- priate? And he gazed with eager delight on the joy manifested in their young countenances. But what had wrought this change, from the cottage to the palace? from penury, want and care to the pleasures of a home like this? He was speculating even in his sleep-but the warm rays of the morning sun shining into his bed awakened him, just before the sounding of the reveille. He started up to dispel the illusion which clung about him like a nightmare. The fearful oaths and imprecations of the two old women still sounded in his ears, and the snow which lay so white around the cottage wove itself into a shroud, wrapped about his soul cold and still. "If it be only a dream," said he, aloud, " it wears the  semblance of reality-it must be looked into-oh, if my darlings should be wronged and oppressed, there is none to defend them. But these unwelcome thoughts    THE BATTLE OF LIFE. "      99 shall be banished from my mind; there is still an over- ruling Being, who shapes ti destinies of nations--who clothes the lilies in their beauty and hears the ravens when they pry!" It was well that the mind of Wsebrough pould shake off the unhappy impression of that dream, for there were no flowers springing in his- pathywy, save those planted by the hand of memory or affection. The more he thought upon this strange and troubled dream, the more he resolved to return home, if only for few days, in order to calm his agitation and disperse his doubts, for now at this -crisis they threatened to overwhelm him--no such fearful distrust had before entered his mind-he had really left their happiness incomplete, in eager haste and new-found ambition, or to one alone had not been confided the care of all that was 'dear to him. At length the corps were ordered to another station, there to reinforce a division who were threat- ened with battle. It was a long and tedious march, and intolerable thirst added to the weariness and' de- pression of the men. After marching all day, they came upon a stream which -gushed from a rock, clear and limpid as crystal. But they scarcely dared to drink, for in that climate, overcome by the intense heat, it was certain prostration, and to some as certain death. They gathered round it, listening to the tinkling sound on the pebbles. How many times in after years those care-worn men recalled that scene-the tall and gloomy rock, covered with moss and lichens, ornamented with the fragrant vines peculiar to that climate, full of scars let flowers, the source of that delightful spring, whosp waters cooled their brows and quenched their fiery thirst-it was like nectar, the drink of gods. It was -\   100        LILLIAN: OR, dearer than the fountain of youth to the tottering pil- grim on the shore of Time. There they rested until midnight, and aided by the moon and stars pressed on- ward to the distant goal; the march continued three days, but the enemy had changed his tactics, having withdrawn his forces without giving battle, they were then re-ordered into Virginia. Care and fatigue had wrought upon the condition of Rosebrough, until he was really unfit for duty, and under this plea obtained that for which he had so long sighed, temporary ex- emption from military duty. It would prove a brief if not a permanent relief. With his knapsack, containing many curiosities, stored with choice collections ob- tained during his southern campaign, he journeyed night and day, taking no rest, allowing no delay. What a surprise would it be to his darlings--how much would there be to relate on both sides. The joyful greeting, the united family circle, were never absent from his mind during the journey. Occasionally a sad fore- boding of something yet unknown flashed over his -ar- dent longings for home and rest, for familiar scenes and faces, rendering him supremely miserable. Then he would dismiss it as the result of depression and ill health, caused perhaps by remembrance of the dream, which yet haunted him vividly, tantalizing and unwel- come. lHe arrived at the city of his home, panting with ardor, breathless from exertion, fatigue and sus pense; the familiar dwellings and faces which he passed were altogether unnoticed. It was: his home-the home of his children-the grave of his wife-it had witnessed his bridal in younger and happier days, and although spring diffused its melting sunshine over the budding earth, there was nothing which to his eye could add   THE BATTLE OF LIrE.      101 a charm, a single charm, to the blessed and holy asso- ciations crowding over him. Several times he lifted his hat, and wiped his brow, and cleared the mist from his tearful eyes, that the landscape might look brighter and his face wear a more cheerful aspect to the little group at home. "Lillian," said he, with a sad smile, "will be calm and thoughtful; she will sit beside me, clasping my hand and smoothing my hair, with the old and tender manner! Ah, she is a sad little dreamer! but realities, the stern realities, will soon dissipate her childish visions! How soon they vanish!" and he brushed a  tear from his eye. "Well, she is a sweet, loving child, scarcely a child; and I believe she inherits this weak- ness. Eva will bound, and smile and carol in her joy to meet me, and the pleasant evening, the joyful-morn- ing will pass so rapidly away-and I must return! But let me not anticipate! Ah! here is the gate! let me enter softly, and break in upon them unawares!" Then, in his eagerness, he passed the open gate, which swung back on its hinges with a solemn, creaking sound. It was but a step from the graveled walk to the little porch, over which the young leaves trembled and thrilled as if with a sudden transport. A wild bird that had built her nest there, chirped and fluttered, as though the new comer were an usurper. He had al- ready folded his darlings to his heart in imagination, but the door was between them-a step, a bound, it was thrown back. Desolation, desertion, darkness- silence alone responded to his frantic cry-"Lillian! Eva!"  The call was repeated again, and again, with the bitterness and anguish of a broken heart. Stupe- fied for a moment, bewildered, he stood still, glaring , .   102        LILLIAN: OR, wildly about him-there was not a piece of furniture, a carpet, a table or chair, to establish the identity of things. Was he not still dreaming? Then a flood of emotions overwhelmed him, and covering his face he wept aloud. "Where were they? where should he seek them in that great and populous city? Were they dead? were they living?" He had been deceived. One thing was evident! Margaret, the woman whom he had trusted, had per- jured her own soul-for had she not solemnly many times affirmed with an oath, that she would discharge her duty or die at the post. With calmness came re- flection-he would seek them untiringly. Was there any clue to any mystery which evaded the grasp of energy and perseverance? Oh, if there were any power in love, any affinity in souls, any electricity in the links of social affection, there would be a strong vibration- he possessed the key! They must and should be-found! He sat down exhausted and miserable upon the steps, where Lillian had sat so often, arranging bouquets, weaving garlands, and in the shadows which flitted around him, for the evening had come apace, he could see her distinctly, and several times he rose to his feet to pursue the light and graceful, but unreal figure of his child. He knew not even where to seek Margaret, the traitoress, the criminal! The mild breath of that delightful season visited him as he sat gloomy and de- spondent with its refreshing odors, and he turned his eyes instinctively to the window, now darkened, where a flood of glory had shone from the rising moon upon the face of an angel, who had once been his. "Oh, my God!" cried he, aloud, "it is too much!   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      108 She can not return! They will not come back I am bereaved '" and the faint echo, from the hills . ear by, answered, "I am bereaved!" It was too much-more than he could endure; the fearful tension upon the chord of feeling, produced by suspense and anticipation, threatened to break and de- stroy that exquisite harp, constructed by a Divine Hand. He rose, and endeavored to walk, reeling like one who treads the deck of a ship in a tempest-but with exertion his step became firmer, and he retraced his way to the distant city, for repose, if it might be found-in order to institute a search for his lost dar-  lings. Exhausted beyond mortal endurance, its was well that Rosebrough fell into something like a transi- tory repose-it was fitful, however, and unrefreshing- many times he awoke, expecting, hoping it was already morning; but, throwing open his blinds, soon discov- ered the mistake from the dense darkness, which en- veloped the city, and promised a heavy storm of rain, or a gale. Toward morning a terrific peal of thunder startled him, aad soon a vivid flash preceded another; it was the first thunder storm of the season. The wind rushed and moaned through the open shutters, closing and opening, and reclosing with a violence that threatened to destroy them. He arose and paced the floor, pausing at times to look out upon the deserted streets and gloomy thoroughfares of what had been his happy home. He was now a wanderer-an outcast! There was not a single tie to bind him to:Athe great human family-and inl his isolation, still hoping faintly to recover his jewels-he felt like a shipwrecked ma- riner,clinging to an iceberg. The heayy thtu der, peal after peal, continued to roll above his head--the Ulght- t   .   104        LILLIAN: OR, ning flashed, and huge drops of rain pattered on tile window. Nature wept--he could not -but his heart was bleeding at every pore--and wild, infeasible schemes of exploration swept over his mind--wildly-- rudely as the storm-fiend-no sooner come than gone--bearing away his hopes--fragile flowers in the fierce maelstrom of despair! The storm abated, and I ray of light, just one faint ray, streamed in through the window from the parted clouds, on the white wall of his room, and seemed to search his soul for one corner where it might abide-a welcome guest; but it shone on a ruin-the wrecks of former joys and pleasures- the phantoms of departed loves. Could peace brood over it with her white unsullied wings? Could a rain- bow ever span the arch in triumph? Suddenly the sun burst forth-the heavy clouds rolled away to the south; a rustling was heard in the air of wings and leaves- a delightful fragrance from the shrubs and plants. Rain drops still glistened everywhere--even Rose- brough stood and gazed-gazing, he drank in the fresh- ness and freedom of that exhilarating morning. But he turned hastily away, and donning his soldier's dress, could not wait to break his fast, but rushed forth madly into the street. His first course was a return to the neighborhood of the cottage, where, perhaps, by diii- gent inquiry he could discover their retreat-or, if that failed, he could arouse the police, and leave no place unexplored, where they or Margaret might be lodged. Passers-by regarded him as a pale, sickly soldier, on some very important business, intent only on its c- complishment; some paused and looked after him, as he rapidly disappeared down the street, and said men- tally, that he was mad or about to be so. And they   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      105 were nearly right in their conjectures--he was mad with pain and remorse-the latter stung him like an adder. That he ever should have left his children to the care of one, who had wronged and abused, and per- haps driven them to, desperation by her wicked and tyrannical actions. What might they not have suf- fered? or be suffering now? And it was all his fault- his! He, who would have cherished them as his own soul-before his hopes of heaven--he, who had prom- ised and pledged his faith to a dying wife, that none should be so near and dear-was it not perjury? He knew well that Lillian would brave any danger for the . i sake of her sister-that she was full of spirit and en- ergy, covered by a quiet and reserved demeanor. This, then, accounted for her long and ominous silence. Tor- tured by these thoughts, urged to desperation by the stings of conscience, it was not strange that he exhib- ited the terrible emotions of his soul on his counte- nance, and in his hurried manner. He arrived before the gate again-how beautifully and fresh the garden looked in the morning -light-sparkling with the rain and sunshine. The gay beds of tulips on which Lil- lian had especially prided herself, together with the delicate 'daffodils, were bursting into bloom and beauty. The lilacs were filled with- buds, already fragrant and  bending down with the weight of bloom. He could not look at them, for there before him was the cottage, desolate, lonely, forsaken. While he stood thus, his face shaded by his hand, partly to conceal his features, partly to protect it from the sunlight, an old man drew near and accosted him. "Good morning, sir-this is a sweet, blooming little spot-but no one:lives in the cottage.    106        LILLIAN: OR, There was no reply. "A soldier, sir?" "Can you tell me,"' said Rosebrough, at last with an effort, " can you tell me anything of the family who used to live here?" "Oh, yes, a great deal--the man's name was Rose- brough! Bless me, how pale you are! He had a very delicate, pretty wife-but she drooped and died, poor thing! and some said it was his ill treatment, and others that her pride killed her, for you must know, sir, that once they were rich, but he fell into some kind of a specula- tion and lost it all, and then, as I have said before, she drooped and died! And from this time, it seems, things went on very badly--the children were uncared for-the garden uncultivated-the cottage untidy, and at last he deserted them all together, and joining a company of volunteers, went off no one knew whither." Here the narrator paused. Rosebrough could just ask: "Well, and what became of the children?" "That is the mystery; they disappeared suddenly one cold night, if I remember rightly, it was Christmas eve. No one looked after them to be sure," he con- tinued, " and in a great city like this, there are thou- sands of mysteries more difficulty of solution." Rosebrough clung to the little gate for support-he did not reck the public opinion-their aspersions were idle as the wind, and yet his own conscience could not entirely clear him of the heinous charge -why had he not listened to the pleadings of Lillian, and his own heart? Still, he could not stay there, inactive, worth- less, and see his darlings dying slowly, surely, before his eyes, of hunger and cold. He had hoped fondly,   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      iO7 earnestly to place them in a happier and more exalted station-he had failed of any good result, and the last drop was added to his cup of woe. He was blind- upon the very failure of his best plans and projects was laid the foundation of their future happiness and emolument. But he ventured to speak again. "And the woman who kept the cottage-do you know nothing of her?"' "Oh, she flourished finely after the man's ,depart- ture-and some were suspicious of her--a few watched her, and reported that she had really appropriated the money intended for the children to her own use." 1 Ah! his dream! now it stared him in the face, a dark reality. ' But where is she now, do you know, can you tell i" said he, clutching the gate more firmly. "Absconded! to elude all inquiry and pursuit. But did you know the family, sir? that you take such an interest, or are you a relative?" "This cottage," he replied, huskily, " was my home- those children were mine.. God bear me witness that I loved them as none other. Never repeat these idle rumors again. My wife did not die of a broken heart, she died in my arms-loving, trusting and blessing me to the last. But for those innocents I had never left my home, I did it for their advantage-that they might have comforts and maintenance, which otherwise could not be procured! And now I have returned, to find all desolate and forsaken. I am all alone! I am- all. alone!" The man's anguish spoke in every line and feature of his noble face. "I would not have said this for the world, sirY, to   108        LTLTTTAN: OR,  grieve or distress any one, believe me; I did not know you, and sympathize in your misfortune." "Do you think-is there any hope of recovering them? I would go the wide world over for one more em- brace-to fold them in my arms-to feel their hearts throb with mine-and their young cheeks press my old and care worn face-to rest in their innocent love." And he folded his arms with a frantic motion, as if to embrace some invisible being. He had been com- paratively young when he left that cottage, now he had grown old, and bent with the burden of his wearing and destructive grief. ' "I must save time," said he, "for there are only a few days remaining to prosecute this search! Do you think any of the neighbors living about here can enlighten me? "Perhaps, perhaps," said the other, hopefully, "there is nothing lost by trying!" Encouraged by these words, for a sinking man will chase a bubble, he crossed the street, and knocked at the door of a tenement, which could not compare with his own cottage, either in beauty or cleanliness. It was opened by a child about the age of Lillian, but dissimilar in every respect. "Ask your mother to come here a mom(nt," said he to her; "I wish to see her." The child ran into the adjoining room and called out loudly: "Mother, mother, here is a soldier wants to see you!" "Well, bid him wait!" "Come in, sir," said Nelly, returning to the door; "mother will be here in a moment." There was no alternative; if he wished to make any A       .           - 4'    THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      109 inquiries, he must have patience. He entered and sat down by the door, where a view was had of the home he had loved, reposing so quietly amid the trees and budding beauties which surrounded it. It seemed to him a long and tedious hour before the mistress en- tered-she might have made her appearance before without fearing his scrutiny; he had neither eyes nor heart for any-the world was a waste to him. "Good morning, madame," said he, rising, without concealing his deep agitation, " did you knowea family by the name of Rosebrough, who lived opposite in that little cottage over the way?" No one, not even familiar friends, would have recog-. nized his voice. "Rosebrough! Rosebrough!" said she, as an incen- tive to memory, " seems to me there was a family by that name lived about here!" The little girl who had waited upon him, now came in, timidly, and stood holding her mother's dress, seemingly the more intelligent of the two. "Why, yes, mother," said she, "don't you know Lillian and Eva?" How those words made him'start, with a sudden irre- pressible pang. "Nettie knows more about 'em than I do, sir," said the woman. "Come here, my little girl," and he sat down, reach- ing his hand, to lead the child nearer; "when did you see Lillian last?" "Oh, she came here in a grand carriage, and a lady with her that they say keeps the OrphanAsylum. She had to go there, r'spose, for her father went away, and of course they had n't nothing to eat. The lady was    "O        LILLIAN: OR, very kind, sir, I'm sure, to take care of' her and Eva, The girls all said they was so proud, and wouldn't speak to nobody, that somethin' would happen 'um." "Yes," added the old woman, with an air of tri- umph, "I alwus telled my girls that pride must have a fall!" "I knew these children," replied Rosebrough, " they were neither proud nor unkind, but quiet and reserved; you know, madame," added he, in a softer tone, "' they had lostjheir mother!"-. "Yes, and their father, too, for all the good he did them!" "But I hear," said Rosebrough, "that he left a housekeeper, a woman, to take charge of the little ones -what became of her?" "I believe she took to drink," replied the woman, more seriously, " neglected the cottage and the chil-. dren," she was talking more intelligently, "and they both went to ruin." "But, mother," added the little girl, " they must be well off now, or they would not ride in such a fine carriage!" "Oh, ho!' replied she, with a toss of her head, "that's no sign they are well to do in the world! Couldn't we ride in as grand a carriage if we was as proud?" Rosebrough perceived that to prolong the scene was only to increase his distress--nothing could be elicited of any value. Their hint of the Orphan Asylum might prove important information-he had not thought of that-possibly Lillian had sought refuge in that chari- table institution, which was situated At a distance from this part of the town; it was not .only possible but   THE BATTLE OS LIFE.      1il probable; strange that it had not been before suggested to his mind; and bidding, them a kind good morning, and many thanks, bowed- and departed. He glanced first at one dwelling, then at another, as if the charac- ter of the inmates were visible from without, but all was dark and unsatisfactory; he was convinced that nothing could be gained in this location, and with a heavy and desponding heart turned away, bending his footsteps in the direction of the Orphan Asylum. The morning had passed in a fruitless and unavailing search. In the meantime, upon regaining the central portion of the city, he lost no time in arousing the police, and bribing them to an efficient and speedy pursuit of Mar- garet, who was worse than a murderess--as her wicked deeds had consigned him to a living tomb--he did not breathe the fresh air of heaven, he did not tread the virgin earth; one only aim loomed up with its meteor light upon his horizon, now kindled by the star of hope, now fading, dying, as his languid footsteps- re- fused to hasten at his bidding. The police informed him that they knew the woman to whom he alluded; they had seen her many times in- company with one not quite as hideous, but with whom she was apparently on the most intimate terms. But of late, that was within the two past weeks, she had- not come under their observation; they had seen her last in a drinking saloon. And such was- the creature to whom he had intrusted the care and happiness of his darlings! How could he have been so short-sighted? Where was his discernment? She had fairly entrapped him with her affable manner and assumed love of chil- dren, which he had failed to see was the cloak of hypocrisy-- a wolf in sheep's clothing! Dinner hour 10'      .   "2        LILLIAN: (R, passed unheeded, still intent on his arduous pursuit. The distance from his cottage to the Orphan Asylum was at least four miles, but excitement and anxiety bore him onward with fevered haste. The tall rows of mercantile houses, with their flaunting display of new goods in the show-windows, or hanging without in long festoons, were unnoticed; but if he heard a child- ish burst of laughter, or a sweet low voice like Lillian's, 'he would start, turn pale and gaze eagerly about him. But again he had passed the city bounds, and walked through the beautiful country which environed it. But the orchard and the tidy farm-house shared the fate of all others on his route. It was not long, then, before the object of his solicitude, the home of the friendless stood out in bold relief before him, isolated like the little beings it contained. It was a plain brick building, of goodly dimensions, but square, low and unprepossess- ing: There were some young shade trees, which were neither full grown nor thrifty at regular intervals, and the sun, which shone with uncommon intensity for that season of the year, glared upon it, unrelieved by any grateful shadows. What if again he should be the vic- tim of a cold and bitter disappointment? There was nothing remaining to him, but to press on and on in the great struggle. One defeat was but the fortune of war, and might be retrieved upon a second or third attempt. He stood upon the stone step, and was soon admitted. The matron lost no time in answering his summons. His errand was soon told, in simple but pathetic lan- guago: "I do not think," said she, in reply, "that your children are here! I believe you called them your own, sir? At least there are none answering to those   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      113 names. There have several," continued she, thought- fully, "been admitted within the past week, but they differ from your description." "It may be," said he, catching at a straw, " that they are among the number, only there is some mistake -my description may not be lucid-if I might see them, it would dissipate all doubts." "As you please, sir," said the matron, obligingly. She was a woman, and could but sympathize with his grief, so apparent and overwhelming. They went into the first room, where the oldest children, about the age of Lillian, were seated at their studies. Their dresses were of plain dark material, with the customary long white aprons. How his soul yearned over them, now the case had been brought home to his own feelings. Their countenances differed widely, and yet, perhaps, it was his imagination, they all wore the same homeless, dejected look. Still he would his darlings had been intrusted to the care of this matron; they would have received attention, instruction and kindness at her hand-he was confident of this. "Will you look into the lower departments?" said the matron. "I scarcely know," said he, turning ghastly pale, "I think they are together-that is if Lillian has been consulted. Oh, madame," continued he, hurriedly, "there are few children like her! caring for every one in preference to herself-gentle, obedient, dutiful!" The mist was gathering in his eyes again but he wiped it away, and said-- I must go through the lower departments, if you please, madame. It will be a constant reflection to me that I left any corner unex- plored. Tell me," added he, fiercely, " what should be     .   "4        LILLIAN: OR, the punishment of such a woman as she wh, has robbed me-not of money, madame, it is not that-but of my children?"  "You did not know her character, then," replied the matron, "when you left them in her keeping?" "I was blind, or her character was concealed!" Gradually she drew from him a short but touching narrative of his life; with a true and gentle instinct, she led his mind to the consideration of a higher and holier hope-it tranquilized him-afforded a temporary relief to his feelings, and brought back a ray, one sin- gle ray, of the former trust. The matron knew well that it was useless to look for them-she had believed this from the first-they were not there-but she deemed it better for the man to see and be. convinced by degrees of his false hope. She led the way, ques- tioning of his life in the army, of the Southern coun- try, of the futur prospects which overshadowed the land of freedom; at first he replied only in monosyl- lables, but at length became interested, and recounted many little incidents of his military campaign. He gave a furtive glance at the children assembled in the second department; again the blood forsook his cheek and he reeled backward with a giddy motion. The matron immediately led him into a quiet, comfortable room, where from her own store she produced a bottle of wine and some bread. The wine was eagerly quaffed, and produced an instantaneous effect upon his ex- hausted system. "Madame," said he, "you are kind* I have not partaken of any food to-day." "You will prove incompetent to your taskl, said she, gently, "'if you do not strengthen your mind with   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      115 hope, and your body with proper sustenance. We are all in the hand of a great and good Being, who .hn produce light from darkness, order and beauty from the wildest chaos." The words and tone sunk into his heart. "There is no grief like mine," said he; "if my chil- dren had died and been buried out of my sight, they would rest in God; but now they walk the earth, they retain their being-but how? where? in what condi- tion? or under what influence?" It was indeed a thrilling case, appealing to the heart, eliciting the deepest sympathies of a woman's nature! The matron wiped away her gathering tears, which were worth the world to him, and answered, softly:  "Be assured that every one thinks his grief the deepest and most-incurable. Until you know your children are dead, there is hope-hope of their resto- ration to your arms-hope of their happiness and well- being. Perhaps your very plans are in fulfillment at  this moment--we can not grasp the Infinite, often vailed in clouds and darkness, while his face shines to- ward us like the sun. Be comforted-rest -until to-  morrow, and: then renew your -search. The day is already far spent, and the night will overtake you be- fore reaching town." ' How can I rest," and he arose and paced the apart- ment, striding from :one inclosure to the other, like a  caged lion, "when they be near me and I know -it not! They may be calling to me in piteous accents! at least they think I have deserted them. There is one thing," said he, pausing, "which looks strangely-Lillian is an uncommon child-I gave her my address, and told  her to write frequently; she has not complied with my   "6        LILLIAN: OR, request. I haa received two letters from her, alid there the correspondence ceased on her part--it beto- kens violence; she can not be living, or she -would obey me." The matron was lost in silent thought. 4"Let us dismiss the subject for the present-we can not unravel it, my friend-trust to time, energy, and patient exertion." He did not turn away from her, nor refuse her re- quest, preferred in a calm, almost authoritative voice. She strove by every gentle act to compose his mind to rest, and soothe away its terrible agitation--which was accomplished in a measure. He had lost his wild and fitful glances-the flush and succeeding pallor of his countenance-the hurried and agitated step. He could discuss the matter in a more hopeful way, and speak of the past, not as irremediable. She had provided a cheerful and light apartment, everything conducive to the restoration of his fallen hopes and spirits. Fa- tigued beyond endurance, not only by his superhuman efforts, but by his terrible excitement, he soon fell into a dreamless repose. This proved a great restorative; he arose refreshed, but with that overpowering feeling which strikes the victim .of a great grief upon his first awakening. Without lingering a moment, he rushed through the-hall, seeking his kind hostess, that he might bid her farewell. The walk to the city was per- formed in less time than on the previous day, because he was fresh-hopeful that the police had ferreted out the hiding place of Margaret. But he was doomed to disappointment again-nothing had been discovered. They were still on the alert; vigilant and detective; they knew every nook and corner in the city, among   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      117      ' the haunts of vice or in the homes of the unfortunate- if she were there, the discovery would soon be effected.   l Oh, no! his last hope was destroyed!  There was nothing left to him, but to watch and pray! pray and watch with a zeal unslackened by time or disappoint- ment. There is no living man who can totally aban- don hope-although it seems to die and desert him al- together-he is still buoyed up by those invisible wings. It is like the phoenix, renewed from its own ashes-springing into life with its own death song! The pursuit was carried on faithfully all that week to no effect, and in the midst of his explorations an order was received from head-quarters to recall the soldier to his-military post, with the prospect of promotion- but his ambitious schemes were at an end forever-for whom should they now be made? not for himself-it was a matter of perfect indifference whether his miser- able life ceased on the battle-field, at the cannon's mouth, or on the downy couch of ease and indolence. -But, despairing of the recovery he so ardently desired, there was no alternative, but to render obedience to the hasty sum-mons. He could no longer remain in the city, fraught with so many hallowed, and of late so many bitter associations. Therefore, he made no de- lay in rejoining the regiment stationed in Virginia. He could never know peace again. Upon his return to the army, he was attacked by a ong and painful illness, induced by the terrible loss he hadjust suffered; its consequent excitement, amount- ing to frenzy-the fatigue incident to his rapid, but unavailing search-the crushing of his dearest, earthly hopes. This prostration was eventually the means of saving' his reason or his life, for the frail thread had \   "8         TLTTTAN: ORE been nearly snapped asunder. Every kind attention was lavished upon him, for he had won all hearts, by his frankness and honesty. Those who knew his history readily accounted for his illness-Lillian and Eva were the words constantly uttered during that-long and weary prostration. Upon his recovery, he was incapacitated for actual service, and placed, much against his inclination, in the Invalid Corps.        '    . He still believed that somewhere and on some day he should meet them-within the confines of earth, upon the shore of Time. There was a vague, mysteri- ous presentiment that they were not lost -to him en- tirely, but for a year, perhaps years, would be sepa- rated from him. The darkness which envoloped their fate would roll away, like the deep mists that hang over the mountain, vailing their summits, but dispelled by the warm rays of the ascended luminary. He was in constant correspondence with the police, who were still endeavoring by every means in their power to clear up the mystery; several times they reported themselves on the track odf the woman, who had injured him--the cause of all his untold sufferings.- But it proved a false report-and so the year wore away, bringing no alleviation --excepting that which time pours into the wounds of the mourning and afflicted. The investigation at length ceased all together-so many matters of importance pressed upon the police, in that large and populous city, and perceiving no fruits from their efforts, wearied and discomfited, the case was resigned. The army in Virginia laid waste her beautiful cities; many battles were fought there, prolific of results. The   THE, BnATTLE. oE LIFE.    119 condition- of the country was still unsettled, and the tem- pest that brooded- over the land was not exhausted-the cloud had risen from the South, no larger than a man's hand, but bearing in its bosom the destiny of a great and powerful, and independent nation--it was rapidly culminating, to burst and scatter destruction though the young and blooming land. Let us wait the issue! II 1 1 " '    -  .  ,-   . 1 - 1' '   CHAPTER VIII. "IT really appears to me, Clara," said Aunt Betsey, "that you and Moore are beside yourselves with that girl Lillian !" Mrs. Carroll, who sat by the open window, for it was spring, engaged in the perusal of a favorite author, raised her eyes mildly without making any reply. "I say, Clara," she persisted, moreemphatically, " it seems to me perfectly absurd that any one should be educated above their station! Just to think! Moore will not send her even to a public school, she must go to a seminary, study the languages and take music les- sons; all this appears to me not only ridiculous but wrong. Her poverty and low birth will always cling to her-one can not rise above such things." " You forget, Aunt Betsey," she replied, "-that this was once our own estate, only through earnest en- deavor, and a kind Providence, we might be still more unpleasantly situated. We should remember these things, as a preventive to pride." "Always reflecting on me, Clara! I was never very poor, and am not very proud! It has ever been one of your inconsistencies to favor strangers more than your own relations! This is neither natural nor scrip- tural !" "Is she angry," said little Eva, who was amusing herself with some toys, "because her hat was spoiled ?" That ludicrous scene having made such an impression   on her mind, it could not be effaced. Aunt Betsey angrily replied: "Never speak, unless you are addressed, Miss, and remember, ' Handsome is that handsome does !'" Aunt Betsey was very much afraid that she would be spoiled by vanity, and Eva said no more, but con.. tinued to arrange the painted blocks, of which she was building houses.'  "I thought," said she, again, "when I came to live here, it would be so quiet and delightful-no children to make playhouses of the rooms, and fiddle-strings of my nerves, but I was mistaken! now was n't I?  Here came two little nameless dirty beggars, without any- thing or any one to recommend them! but they creep right into my innocent sister's heart, and that-is enough." Mrs. Carroll laid her book aside, finding the effort of reading vain. "Have they or I done you any harm, Bgtsey ?" "I am sure we were not dirty,"- said Eva, compre- hending her words, " and Lillian never begged, neither did I."  "What did I tell you?" said Aunt Betsey, more angrily, " never speak until you are spoken to!"  "Eva," said Mrs. Carroll, "you can go out, on the verandah and play." The child gladly availed herself of the privilege, for the air was soft band mild' laden with the incense of early budsand leaves, while the insect world was alive to its grateful influence, and the two ladies were left alone to enjoy themselves according' to their different proclivities.

She thought it would detract from her own supremacy, as the govern- ment was not placed in her hands, and it might dimin- ish her resources, for none could be more lavish of ex- penditure than she; knowing well that past the prime of life, possessing neither beauty nor accomplishments, to render her graceful and attractive, she falsely fan- cied that show would cover the dearth and weakness of her character. All of her qualities were in exact contradiction to those of her lovely and unassuming niece. The latter had borne patiently all of her peev- ishness and outhurts of temper; there was no refuge. Aunt Betsey had no other home, and this constant op- position to her charitable purposes was the only dis- cipline to which her life had been subjected, and she bore it patiently-to rebel was to wage a continual warfare-she rarely replied, save in a calm and decided voice, that left no hope of alteration in her favorite schemes. Some would have been supremely wretched under the constant surveilance of such a, tormentor, but on the contrary she -was happy, because virtue is peace. When they were left alone, Mrs. Carroll repeated the question fiimly, looking at her aunt with an unflinching gaze, . Have they or I done you any harm?"  "Harm!" she repeated; "6 that is a pretty question to be sure! You know I never liked children, and do not now; merely because a romantic whifn has" taken hold of my imagination! . But my feelings were ri not   THE BATTLgE OF LIFE.      123 consulted! the usurpers -were planted here, right be- fore my face and eyes!"

Hereafter, I desire -you to remain silent on the subject!" Aunt Betsey was petrified by this solemn;announnce0- ment, which left no room for opposition. A significant , humph!" accompanied by a toss of the 'head;, was her only reply evincing that her illnature was only silenced, not subdued. Eva played alone and quietly;   [,e she watched the golden sunlight waving over the, gay  parterre, the flutter of birds amid the foliage, th :breeze ,  wantoning with the bright spring beauties, and the un clouded heaven arching down to the earth-like those? beneficent spirits who watch over :mortalls-,the immor- tal, clad in light, ministering to the earthly, clad in sorrow and perpetual mourning. She ran back and forth, exulting in her young life, warbling and dancing, but the fierce tones of Aunt Betsey, mingled with the gentle and entreating accents of Mrs. Carroll, dqterrel her, so she sat down, looking to the gate and hoping but not dreaming that Lillian was near: Still looking intently, she descried the object ot her thoughts coming slowly up the walks' and ran joyfully to meet her.   124        TIT T.TAN: OR, "Lillian," said she, " let us go home, I do not love Aunt Betsey!" "Why, my darling,s" said Lillian, in surprise, "you must not talk so! think of their kindness, and 'all that they have done for us." "She saysrwe are dirty beggars! and I know she does not want us here; let us go home." Lillian dared not tell the child the: truth! she could not say they were homeless, friendless, save in their new relation, but she answered in a low and tender voice, "Wait till we hear from papa." "Where is papa? why does he not come home? Does he love us yet, Lillian?" "Yes," though the words almost choked her, he will nevet cabse tf love us! '  "Will you play for me on the piano, sister? I never heard anything so beautiful!" "Yes, if Mrs. Carroll is willing." And they went in together. The coveted amusement was sought ahd obtained. Lillian seated herself at' he instrument and commenced warbling in her own pecu- liar rich and thrilling accents a simple melody, old, but never worn out, "Let us love one- another."  She did not know that she had an auditor, but Aunt Betsey had entered, too-she waited patiently till the conclusion of the melody and then went directly to the piano and closed it. "I think that will answer for to-day's exhibition," said she, curtly; "little girls, especially poor ones, ought to know their places."          "Mrs. Carroll gave me permission, madame." "That will do, you may leave the room.; Cold and bitter as was her sarcasm, Lillian felt that -   THEE BATTLE OF LIFE.            ,i it was unjust, aind although it -did; not take away the entire sting, yet softened it. She took Eva and went out into the sunshine. When the outer door had closed, and they were alone, Eva said, hastily, 'She is a cross, bad woman, Lillian. ' I do not love -her;-do you?" "Little sister," said she," my Eva, you must not speak so hastily, you must-be gentle and not murmur; we are - so much happier than we were with Margaret, and you know that Mrs. Carroll, our best friend, bears with her ill-temper-never reply to her, but take it patiently." They sat together in the sunshine, talking of the past, for Eva understood her sister, and was knit zto her by- the firmest tie of sympathy.    '  "My garden is all in bloom now, little one,' said  she; "if app a should come home he could never find us, it is so far away!" "Let us go back, Lillian, that was a happy home- - shan't we go?'  Lillian could not: explain the matter to her, she could not tell her that it was no longer a home for them biit'. desolate or tenanted by strangers. She endeavored to soothe her with- accounts of her school life. - It is so delightful," said she, "to learn and study:about the great world in which we live-but we live: on the earth, Eva, and so we look up to the stars and moon-which borrow their light from the sun ;'and I:believe they are all worlds," said she, slemnly,;:." for I have read in the Bible that God shall judge the &worlds. l:How often I sit and think what sort of beings there are in those bright dwellings, whether they love and suffer and weep as we do."    126        TTLTA3T:N- OR, "Is mamma in the' stars?" said Eva, borrowing the same solemn tone. "Perhaps so, and perhaps papa is -there, too!"She had said this thoughtlessly, "Oh, we shall never see him again, then," and she burst into a flood of tears. "What have I said?" ejaculated Lillian; " we shall surely see him again, my darling." "But if he is in the stars we can not reach him." "If he does not come back to us, we shall go to him! But see, Eva, the beautiful sun is setting, and it is go- ing down back of the old cottage, shining redly on the tops of the trees, on the low roof, and over the graveled walk," and she sighed softly. "Let us go back, Lillian " How well she comprehended what was in the heart of the child-the home-sickness, the yearning for fami- liar scenes and faces; it is long before these become dimmed, even in childhood. She laid her head, with its wealth of golden curls -caressingly on -the arm 'of Lillian, nestling closely to her, with a fond, confiding gaze. "Eva is going home, too, Lillian," said she, softly. The strange words thrilled her with a silent and deep distress. "Oh, do not talk so, my darling; -we forget our kind, good friends, Mrs. Carroll and Mr. Moore. Why, Eva, it is so strange they should love us and care for us- they are no relation to us." But the night dew began to fall, and the air grew chilly after the sun had set, and the voice of their friend was heard calling them to come in. "Mr. Moore told me -I must not stay after dark; good night, Mrs. Carroll; good night, Eva."   THE BATTLE, OF LIFE.      127- There were many such delightfuil interviews between the children all that summer, arranged by Moore and his mother-and-law, To Florence, Lillian was a sealed book, neither desiring nor studying to read :their pages, nor to look within-as-usual, her own vanity was para- mount, if that were gratified, she remained cold and in- different to everything besides. But the: ,change Lil- lian was daily working in the character of Moore was real, if not apparent; with her child-like simplicity- she had won his heart-she had pointed the way to a higher and brighter existence-she had been the herald 0f the morning to his soul--she -had taught him, in her own sweet way, many truths, learned in boyhood, but for- gotten, because unregarded--cast away, to be gath- ered again as priceless jewels. It was not remarkable that he loved her. She had seen the same figure several times that had excited her childish fear and curiosity; once when, the moon shone brightly through the half opened shutters, and she could watch its movements distinctly as by daylight. It was evidently the figure of a woman, ibut dressed in deep black; it always came in at the outer door, paused a moment by the bedside, and then gliding on-knelt down at the door of Mrs. Moore's private apartment. There was never any allusion made' again to the singular appearance. Lillian feared to incur her friend's displeasure-and now she was becoming some- what accustomed to it;- when she remained unmolested she could even sleep and enjoy repose, the same as she- had ever done. Her progress was really wonderful- " at school no one excelled her-this was 'partly owing to her native genius, and again to the untiring indus-' ury with which she prosecuted her studies. I do not-   128        ', TTTBJAN: OR, know, as I have said before, that it opened a new world to her-she found there were worlds above, around, beneath, of which she knew nothing. A world of floral bloom, she had regarded simply as beautiful exhibitions of Divine skill and power-now she learned they had a language-that each petal, stamen, calyx, and pistil testified to the character and position of the plant, like the qualities of human beings, making up from small indices the grand or insignificant whole; and so they were classed like individuals into useful or ornamental, simple or grand--they were annual, perennial or amar- anthine. If she had loved flowers before she had studied them, she loved them now doubly, for the sweet words they uttered-inaudible-whispered only to the. soul. There was history with its heroes and heroines; its mighty men of valor and their deeds. And she  learned that ambition had cdost the angels their place in heaven-that it had destroyed kingdoms, and cast down the crowns of kings and emperors at their feet-that it was a great and terrible sin'-"but she could not at present look more deeply into its results-- nor knew that it was the cause of Florence Moore's unhappiness, and the wreck of her husband's temporal peace--and applied to her own case that had her father never been ambitious for his darlings, their home would still be open to them; but this latter case did not re- semble the others--his ambition had been only lauda- ble. But Lillian's chief delight consisted in music-- and this accounted for the rapid progress which she made; it expressed all'the deep and- tender emotions of her soul-pathetic, plaintive or exhilarating, as she wished to make it. Under these circumstances she was not likely to become a mechanical player-the simplest    THE BATLE OF LIFE.       129 notes were touched with a grace and natural skill which elicited the praise and wonder of all who heard them. Mrs. Moore would have objected seriously to this ar- rangement-she did not approve-with Aunt Betsey- of educating people beyond their station, and- she thought Lillian sadly unbecoming hers--she could not penetrate that quiet and timid manner-in her opinion she was neither pretty nor attractive. There was one advantage gained, however, while she remained in the house, Moore was somewhat preoccupied, so that he did not look into the affairs of others. Her plans were conducted withy a secrecy which did not argue in her favor-it was evident that Moore was dissatisfied with her mode of life-he would prefer to be retired at times, not to be plunging in the gay vortex of the fashionable world, without one moment's , reflection. He, plainly perceived that the end of all this dissipation was total ruin. It was this serious objection that interfered with her favorite plans; however, theywere always executed, if not openly, privately--consummated to suit her own selfish pleasure,- independently of those about her. Night after night there were parties and festivals- dancing and amusements of various kinds in her own elegant mansion; at such times, Lillian, having retired at the usual-hour, would lie awake, listening to the music and dancing-to the other sounds of merriment which the revelers- sent up. She had seen Moore standing, pale: and miserable alone, looking oni but not participating in the revelry. She longed to draw near and offer consolation, and tell him howdeeply she re- spected him, and desired his happiness. Once, with these thoughts flashing through her mind, she lingered near him. He turned abruptly and said:    130        T TrTAN: O , "What are you looking at, Lillian?" The tears gathered in her eyes--she had offended him! "I was looking at you, sir!"  "Why, and with what thoughts!" "If you will not be angry, I was afraid you were unhappy, and I wished to speak to you, but did not dare." "What would you care, if I were unhappy?'- "I would wish to make you happy." He smiled, but it was a sad smile. "And you really love your old friend, Lillian?" "Oh, sir," said she, clasping her hands, "I have never loved any one as well, since-since papa went away!' "If I ask a great favor of you, Lillian, could you comply?" "Yes sir, you have never asked a favor of -me, and I have wished many times that I could do something for you-because no one is as kind as you and 'Mrs. Carroll. Will you tell me what it is?" "'Simply to play and sing for this company--every- thing is artificial here-artificial lights and beauty-' -artificial voices, manners and character.  There is nothing to relieve this; can you comply?" Moore had tested her obedienee and sincerity se- verely; she was so naturally timid, that she shrunk back at his first request, but soon recovered herself; .she must, she would saerifidce her feelings.' "Ah," said he, with a sigh, "you do not wish to please me." "I will," she answered; "now--I am ready!": He took her'by the-hand and led her resolutely for- .   THE :BATTLE -OF -LIFE.      3h ward-the company parted on either sidle to admit them-while every one gazed! in utter wonderment at the little girl who had entered their midst." "My dear," said Mrs. Moore, approaching her hus- band with an affectation of horror, i' I really hope you are not going 'to make yourself ridiculous, 'by exhibit- ing this child?" "You have your enjoyments and I have mine," said he, bitterly and sarcastically.- He arranged the stool, without further comment, bade Lillian be seated. - "Shall I sing your favorite, said sAe, faltering. By this time the movement had collected a great crowd of gayly dressed persons about the piano.- Every vestige of color had fled from Lillian's cheeks--she gave one glace at Moore, almost' of deep and silent en- treaty; his countenance re-assured her. She touched the chords, for a moment everything was dark-her hands seemed paralized., The prelude was ended, the first words of the song breathed low, but musleally, like the silver tinkling- of a distant bell. The spell was brokeni, the ice melted-her whole -soul became merged in- the utterance of -that exiquisite -melody--it' leaped:from heart to heart, even- in that false assembly-L-theyr for- got their sneers, their :criticism, paying her the most perfect- tribute- of admiration--a profound) unbroken silence. "Trembliing,e-epinf, sig, ing,. oh, rmy heart l O'er thy faded garlands still:1thou irt ;# But with: music's deep, ecstatic breath - Clasp thy spirit-love, unchanged in death." These were the last ords -of the soig-it was a sin- gular melody, from "Le Tremolo," adapted to Uillian's   132        TL/TjTAN: OR, , voice, perfectly in tone and expression. The song was completed, and the young cantatrice would gladly have escaped the congratulations which crowded upon her- her friend was pleased and gratified, it was her best reward; and she made her exit rapidly. "Who is she?" they inquired, eagerly-of Mrs. Moore. "I am as ignorant of her origin as- yourselves-she is a protege of my mother, and of late quite under the patronage of Mr. Moore." . She said this with the deepest expression of scorn. The remark had been heard by Moore, who answered immediately: "She is a simple, truthful, loving child! I would that all were like her." "How widely tastes differ," replied his wife; "I be- lieve my husband is perfectly infatuated with the little upstart," and she laughed, ironically. "I am infatuated," said he, "because this is so strange in these artificial days-natural, unperverted taste, simple truthfulness, and an earnest desire for that which is right and good." No, one replied to this, perhaps some felt it as a sarcasm, intended for them; others more obtuse, al- lowed it to pass without application-but Moore and his protege were the subjects of a nimadversion dur- ing the remainder of the evening. "What a singular man!" said one; "totally unlike his gay and beautiful bride." "She can not be- very happy'in his society," said another; " then he is so much older; why, look at his gray hair and his furrowed brow."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      133 "Maybe she will be a gay and dashing widow be- fore long,"' said another, with a laugh. They had judged rightly-they had always been dis- similar, and there was now less prospect than ever of a change in taste or sentiment with either - Lillian had retired to her room, but not to slumber; she stood by the window, watching the shadows of-the statelytrees as they swept across the green--and slop- ing lawn. -A sense of quiet pleasure, of duty well per- formed, elevated and cheered her mind. It had cost her a great effort, but she had conquered, or rather the desire to gratify her friend had carried her successfully through the trying ordeal. There was one sorrow ever pressing down her young life--young in years-ma- ture in thought and feeling--it was the mystery: con.- nected with her father's silence. Mrs. Carroll having no clue to- guide her in searching out -the secret; was constrained to abandon it as hopeless. And the pain- ful thought was ever uppermost in her thoughts' "Had he deserted them, as insinuated by Margaret?" It must be so, or nothing would have deterred:him from writing or returning to look 'after their interests. Again, her own heart bore testimony to his unremit- ting love and kindness-could these cease altogether? She was unwilling to believe it, and so- night after night she lay-awake perplex ng hermtind with ques- tions which could not be answered, and at last lost her- self in the land of dreams, wandering with her father, or seeking. him through 1long -and weary-labyrinths. While she stood gazing but, first on g the placid-moon, or watching the dash of the fountain, her attention Was riveted by the appearance of two persons, who paused beneath her window; one she recognized as Moore, the   1g4        TTLTTTAW: OR,'. other the woman: she had- so often seen in the night-. time. They were in earnest consultation, and she could plainly perceive that Moore looked pale and anxious, that the smile which he had lately worn had vanished, and a stern, proud' expression had taken, its place. They glanced furtively at the window, as, if suspicious of observation, but Lillian drew back into the shadow, trembling and affrighted. "What deception was this, practiced toward his wife?" butt her trust in his integrity was unshaken; it was a mystery belonging to himself alone, and she had no right of interference. Were there not in' fact many things between the un- happy couple, which she could not understand; and why should she seek to know? At last, Moore spoke impatiently. "Let it pass-let it pass-it shall be so no longer. I am weary with watching and anxiety-let it pass for- ever!"  With- these words he drew from his pocket a heavy purse, and without counting the contents placed it'in the woman's hand, who received it silently and turned to depart. Then Lillian had a full view of her face. Moore called to her onee more to return-there were some whispered words between them and they sepa- rated. - Moore did-not enter the house, but walked un- der the green trees, .lo*ing up through their boughs at the stars overhead, in contemplation of the magnifi- cent works -there displayed.: . Lillian wished that she could walk with him,: her ,hand in his, sympathizing, softening, sharing the grief wiieh evidently was his portion. But this was impracticable, and she retired pondering,the scene which had swept every other c(n" aideration from her mind. She had yet to learn that   THE BATTLE Of LIE,.      136 life is aimystery-i-thtat man -isat a mystery:.that d&th is a mystery, and the silent shore bIey ndi 'Th St there is very little hire plain rand om'npriheinsive;: -we h/re not learned to live-, when called upon -to die: aid geti- ration succeeds generation, like .the weaves of the: sea, bearing away their footprints- from  'the:stnds of time.

Florence had turned deadly pale-hie ihad fi verbuit once- spoken so plainly-she had not kninoh ti': nbot that he had been, a listener to her foolish words; but still concealing her emotion, answered scornfully:   "O        LILLIAN: OR,  "Perhaps I ought to make a sacrifice-would it not be better to resign my place at once? ,your nice dis- tinctions ,of right and wrong will be of value to you in the decision." "Florence,' said he, in a stern voice, "I understand your allusion perfectly-let it never occur again! The soul of Lillian is pure as crystal--it is untarnished, and I trust to God will remain so. I repeat my assertion, she is dear to me as. an own daughter, and if you ap- preciated her, you could readily understand my feel- ings."  "It in impossible," she replied, still sarcastically, for me, with my perverted taste, to appreciate worth or excellence, therefore you and she are above and be- yond my comprehension." "Oh, that it were different," said he, sadly; "that you would forsake the gay world, whose friendship once you tested, and turn your consideration to tle world within-to the world beyond. It is not, likely that you can always retain your beauty, it will fade with youth; even now I can trace the impress of a scathing hand upon your cheek and brow; .having cast away the love that once was yours, bereft of beauty, what will sustain you? At such a time," and hisvoice faltered, " we can not lean on earth or earthly friend- ship even-, the soul must look higher--it must plume its wings for heaven!"  "Oh, do- not say any more," said ,she, scornfully, "sermons are always tedious-act your own pleasure, give this fete, but as for myself, I shall not cease to regret having introduced that pert, silly child into our household.

Florence illy concealed the effect of his solemn words.; something like thoughtfulness stole over her counte- nance at times for many days, but the gay round of fashionable life could not be forsaken -the habit was confirmed. There had: been a listener to this conver, sation-an innocent listener however. Lillian was about entering the room when Moore unfortunately proposed the fete to be given in her honor. She stood upon the threshold, but their faces were turned away from her, and they did not see her. She was electrified by the strange words which struck her ear. Mrs. Moore's dissatisfaction and jealousy had been so well concealed and covered over by a false show of interest and generosity, that Lillian believed  her a true friend-but self-love is incompatible with  true friendship, and if Florence could have understood ? and sympathized otherwise with Lillian, this would have formed an inseparable barrier. When the con-   . *4.   "2        'LWT TTjit: OR, versation began, 'TAillian did not know whether-to turn away, to proceed or to await the c'onclusionl of the con- troversy-had she been better skilled :in wordly tactics, she could have solved the question unhesitatingly.  If she turned' away, and was discovered, they would -say she had been listening; on thethe ther hand, it would be intruding. The characters of her guardians were dis- closed to view. In that short eontroversy she learned what had before been hidden from her sight-the false- ness and depravity of the one--the- truth, kindliness and affection of the other. With a sudden, incontrol- lable burst of emotion, Lillian hurried away to weep her grief in silence. She was kneeling at the foot of the cross, where the sainted women of old had knelt-- the Marys and the Marthas-and by which, as upon the ladder in Jacobus vision, the angels of God descend, to comfort the weary-hearts of men! She was -about to enter the great world, from which she had so far been shielded; before her stretched the wide arena-the battle was about to begin--who-should conquer?        -         -d                 i   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.     , 143 CHAPTER IX.

She had endowed a convent, and left a portion of her immense wealth to the Roman Pontiff. Father Ambrose, whose real name was Am- brose Tricilli, had not considered the benefit accruing to his compliance with her last -wishes, in adopting his present character-it was more- the result of a morbid conscience, which led him to believe her dying wishes sacred and unalterable-commands, which could not be slighted, without the curse of disobedience-a crime, without expiation. But the position of priest was be- coming irksome-at such times he strove vainly, by a renewal of his vows and additional penance, to quiet his chafed and anxious spirit. Travers perceived each day that this rigorous system of persecution was fast i undermining the health of his friend, and strove, by every gentle art, to win him over. There were no re- serves between them, except those secrets which had been committed to him at the confessional, and- those only added to the weight of:misery under which he/ was bending. They visited the old man of the- mountain, as the Alpine hermit wase- sometimes called. The gloomy cave in'which he had sought :refuge from the world, overhung one of those smiling valleys in the embrace of the mountain. The olive and--wild grape, with other delicious fruits, were the principal care of ' the simple and untutored, peasants. The ascent was through a dark and narrow defile, but the entrance was concealed by the wild grape vine and red moss, which had found its way there from the valley below. The flocks and herds, scattered through the valley, formed the wealth of its inhabitants. Spots of verdure diver- sified the mountain; there the violet, the anemone, and   "7 THE BATTLE OF LIFE. a few Alpine roses struggled into life and bloom; the tall mountain epines roked to and fro, swaying their branches, groaning'an d  sighing fearf ully. with every  breath of the storm-fiend. The hermit was seated out-  brose; "there are times when his mind seems clouded and darkened  y some real or imaginary evil--then he is absent and morose-neither receiving nor, adminis- tering comfort' Ah!' it is the  same sorrow hich befalls the race that has made  misanthrope--it can not be a saintly virtue to forsake .the Worldit were better Andwiser to live in it, to disseminate morality and religion.

But we mnust woo him forth with gentle words and entreaty, or hewill not admit us.'; They had reached the mouth of the cave,"where all was silent; there was no sound, or the echoes would have responded. At last the figure of the hermit couild le seen through .the vines, standing upright, within speaking distance-it was venerable, but bent with years, and at the same time majestic. His long white locks floated in the wind, andt his beard of the same snowy hue, down upon his breast. Innocence,: simpli- city and holy gravity beamed from hismild blue eyes,   3148       T, TrTANH: OR,           C Father," said Ambrose, " we have come with holy greeting, will- you not admit us .?" "And why' do you bring a stranger with you-? To discover- thee secrecy and' inviolable sanctity of my abode?' "He is- but, a fiend, who has come to implore your blessing, like myself."  "Enter, but remember that the place whereon you tread is consecrated: ground." Putting aside: the vines that grew above the entrance, they were- soon merged in the twilight gloom of the cavern. There was but one room in the hermit's abode; a dim lamp, suspended from the ceiling, gave a ghastly coloring to: everything. In one corner was a bed of dried skins-while a natural table, formed- by the rock, rising to a little hight, surmounted by a slab, round and smooth, which held the simple ingredients of his daily fare. A small brown pitcher of goat's milk-- some figs, and: a bunch of grapes were all. A living fbuntain ran through the cavern, cold, for the sun had never shone upon it--and it glided away like a, shadow, without a murmur, to revel in some congenial place. This supplied his daily baths. "Welcome, friends," said he, "for I doubt! not your assertion," turning to Father Ambrose, "the human face is still dear to me; though: I have fled from the world and the; wrath that is hanging over it., He paused and bowed. before a small: crucifix, which was ornamented with a piece of burning taper, and Ambrose followed his devout example.           "But are you never weary of this solemn and se-  cluded, life?" Travers had ventured this inquiry, as his eye   t49 T1HE BA-TTL E O E LFE . landcere  over fthe iesolate and silent abode.

His voice had sunk to a low whisper..  "All men know sorrow-maturity scarcely comes without it-the prime of life is embittered by passion, envy and discord--and declining age sinks under their accumulated pressure."  "You have already learned my views in what school?" said he quickly, and with a keen glance of his blue eye. "Father," replied Hermann, softly, "I am but a pil- grim. I am seeking that rest which you have evidently found,- but of which I have not even obtained the clue." a As he said this, he turned and looked fixedly at Father Ambrose. "My friend has striven to inculcate his own religious principles into my mind--but all is doubt and darkness, and I can not see beyond." "Who are you?" said the hermit, abruptly.  "I am an earnest seeker after truth--I am no votary of pleasure-but of art.", "Father," said Ambrose, corning to his relief, "he is a friend, whom I have long known and honored-- he has beautified out convent and cathedral with speci- mens of his divine art. I would you might direct him where I can not."' "But I fear--I know he will not learn. And what has he to do with our secrets?" and he eyed him again suspiciously.  "Let us -retire-I have somewhat and but little to say, Father," said the priest, abruptly.    They arose and went together to a remote corner of the cavern. Father Ambrose, kneeling before the lit- tle cross, and the aged priest bending over him in the attitude of a listener, Travers was left alone to survey the scene-his artist eye took it in at a glance. A glance,   THE .BATTL OF LIFE. 1' bright ray of sunlight had peneruted the cavern through, acleft in the rock, shining like gold upon the spring, which- seemed to bubble up lto meet it with a welcome kiss. It shone in on the suppliant figures, of Father Ambrose and the old man' turning his gray locks to the soft hue of youth. Not a whisper reached his ear, till in the momentary excitement he started up and ex- claimed: "Say it is atoned! There- is enough already press- ing on my soul-the secrets of others, which I -can not even tell you, to weigh me downY." ' The old man admonished him to-silence. But the look of oetreaty--the supplicating eye fixed upon his superior, told more plainly the feelings of his soul than any words could do. " Go in peace this time," said he, evidently touched by his expression of suffering; " go in peace! but these secrets,' said he, suddenly, "to what do they re- late?" "My vow, Father! There is a vow that I would not reveal them. Ohi tlht-youmight come adownfrom the mountain ando remain with me; there would then be -a sense of security-aided by your presence aid counsel, there would be ndthing to fear." "It can not be-it can not be," said the hermit, wildly; " the world is like a burning mountain-it con- tains thee elements of its own destruction-but they only smoulder now,"                      , Ambrose perceived that it was dangerous to- press him further-so he rose and rejoined his waitingfriend. The old man led them to the mouthof the eave*S. :: "You are still not insensible to beauty,' said Tra- vers, " for you have chosen the most romantic spot in    152      T TLrTAN: OR, the whole mountain; see those clustering roses and fragrant violets." "I love them," he replied, gently, "because they speak of a higher Power-the same which made the universe-which lighted the lamps of heaven-which planted the grove and the majestic forest, created those tiny, delicate blossoms--none the less. powerful and perfect because small and retiring. They are moral- ists all-they tell of His love and gentleness-- who rules over the garden and the desert-who abides on the mountain and in the valley. Take the lesson home of these little flowers, clothed in their beauty and sim- plicity, without forethought or toil--learn the elements of faith and love, and do not say that the old man of the mountain taught you nothing." They emerged from the: dim light of the cavern into the full: glory of the Alpine sunset. The old man. stood -with is hands and eyes raised to heaven, in the act of blessing--of bestowing a farewell benediction-but he quickly disappeared within the cave, while they threaded their way cautiously through the deHe of rocks, from whence the sunlight was nearly excluded, but which guarded the entrance of the cavern. "I breathe more freely," said Travers; "he is an un- happy fanatic." The priest made no reply, but seemed revolving some intricate subject in his mind. They walked on silently-but Ambrose could not restrain his feelings, and stepping before his friend, paused and confronted him with an eager and mournful gaze. Travers stood confounded by the action and waited for him to speak. "I believe," said he, "that you are my friend; would   THE BATTLE OF' LIFE.     1&8 that it were permitted me to reveal the secret in my keeping--but I have vowed, and my vow is sacred and binding." "What can I do for you?" "Oh, Italy! Italy!" said the unhappy priest, with- out heeding his question, "how are you changed, de- spoiled-your heroes have laid: aside their armor- your pure and spotless garments are defiled. Your churches are gone to ruin; where once the dome of St. Sophia vailed itself in blue, nothing remains but an humble mosque-your days of freedom ande of glory are past, past. But," he continued, " if this worthless life could yield her life-if the blood that is flashing through these veins could inspire her. with new vigor and heroism, how soon might it be shed. Italy! Italy! home of my birth-land of my pride! awake! arise:! Travers dared not venture on the subject of papal supremacy, for the extreme agitation, of Father Am- brose would not permit it. "I have often thought, Travers, of late, that I would leave her to her destiny-that I would seek in the new world that which I can not find here-freedom and' peace." Again the artist gave his hand, tO the priest in reply, silent and: expressive, which was again warmly pressed., "America is a young and glorious lad," said Her- mann, after a pause;  Ii must revisit her familiar scenes-must look once more on hqer familiar faces. And now that my great aim is so near its accomplish- ment, there is a secret yearning to depart." "From  whence does it arise?"' said the priest, quickly.   154        LILLIAN: OR, "Not from the faintest desire to see the object of my youthful choice, as your question intimates.'" " Is there, then, another?" "I have never loved but once." But as he uttered these words, a pair of soft, melan- choly gray eyes seemed to look into his own reproach- fully, and he paused to think-was it true? The sunset which he had just witnessed was painted forever on his memory, the red light, reflected from cliff to cliff, fading out gradually, like mortal hope, leaving the insensible rock lonely and bare. He for- got all but the heaven to- which his gaze was raptur- ously turned. Such is the effect of beauty, absorbing and intense!' But the illusion lingered-the reality died! Ambrose chose to remain with the peasantry in the valley, until morning, -and the artist, with rapid footsteps hastened to return. It was very dark when he entered the little studio, and the air within was filled with the perfume of flowers. He fancied too, that it was an illusion, created by his late reflections-but- it increased as he approached the table, upon which he had left the lamp-he started back, for his hand rested upon a bouquet. Lillian must be near, or from whence came that delicate and expressive tribute? The light revealed the mystery by adding mystery. It was an exquisite and choice collection of flowers, to which was attached, by a crimson cord, one single written line: "Azalie will come to-morrow."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      155 CHAPTER X. LILIAN had endured a fierce moral conflict-moral and mental--her mind had been shaken by contending emotions; duty seemed imperative, bidding her throw off the yoke of dependence , which had, however, been light and pleasant. She feared that it would meet the disapprobation of her two friends, Mrs. Carroll and Mr. Moore. Believing that she was still the innocent cause of much unhappiness, she resolved upon her future course. Her first step was to apprise the guar- dian of her early years, the benefactor of her friend- lesshess, fearing still that he would not sanction the step she was about to talke. "Guardian , said she, " dear guardian! Mr. Moore looked up from the political paper which he was canvassing, and answered, "Well, my Lily, what now?' This was an endearing epithet by which he some- times addressed her. "Do not speak kindly to me; nor smile!" The tears were gathering in her eyes. "What has disturbed you, Lillian?" Hespoke gravely, taking off his glasses, which had become in- dispensable, and laying down the paper on his knee, he drew a chair beside him and motioned hermto sit "I did not intend to be foolish, but it is much moe difficult than I had supposedl" , He made no-reply, but waited in silent expectation   until she should recover strength and courage. He- looked into her face, the tears were ready to fall. ' Lillian has been a moralist!" "I will endeavor tobe'so now" sheanswered, quickly "but, dear guardian, it is my grief at leaving you whiChhlrs overcome 'me!!" "Then -you accept the. proposition?"' -said hbe, in- quiringly. - "And I am afraid, :too," said she, "that iyou will -be displeased When I tell you that I can not accept- the proposition,!" "On what grounds do you reject it? he .is rich and influential--will -not theseinsure happiness?" "But'I do not love him!" "And  is this the only-reason?" and he laughed, lightly.

' said she, with-hesitation, 'You are free to act as you choose. I knew you would speak from the heart--that there would be no deception. I have tested your truthfulness, and am glad. When Grandison proposed the question to me, I told him there was little hope, because you are not congenial. He has come to his vast estate only by in- heritance, which will melt away like snow in the sun- light. Already he fancies that he is irresistible-that his heart and hand will be greedily sought by those vain moths who flutter ever around the glitter of gold and diamonds," he sighed. "I am not disappointed; I am glad." "You have lifted the weight from my heart. Ever since the proposition has been received, this subject has never left my mind. It was not that, however, which influenced my decision in becoming governess. It has seemed to me," she spoke hesitatingly, " that I am an unwelcome recipient of favors-the innocent cause of your unhappiness and domestic difficulties! I have never doubted your love for a moment, although I am but a poor and humble girl, sustained and ele- vated by your bounty. I would sooner return to my own lowly station than cause you a moment's sorrow!" "Who has taught me," said he, solemnlyi;, the way but Lillian? talk not of gratitude; I am still the debtor. It is not you who has made me sorrowful and unhappy-circumstances-circumstances," he repeated, bitterly, " over which I have no control! 1No one can share this -grief with me,"-he wiped his brow--" no one but God can fathom it--but you, my Lily, have done much to soften.

Lillian had stood confronting her all the while-a new light had dawned upon her mind, a fearful,-lurid light that colored every late event. For a moment she stoodl confounded. "Madame," said she, calmly, proudly, ; I can not forget that I am your debtor. God is my witness, that my heart and life are innocent. I do not deny that I love your husband-not more than I would have loved you, but the privilege was denied me. Is he not my benefactor? has he not befriended me and lavished from his bounty countless favors upon me? Could I be in- sensible and ungrateful? Do not accuse him or me of false and wicked intentions. Indeed, you ought to know him better. All these long years he has dealt kindly and tenderly with you, loving .and seeking oaly your happiness. As for me, I will not trouble you further, but do not, can not, forget that I owe you a debt of gratitude, which can never be lightened!" She had spoken calmly and energetically-her words carried conviction with them!. In her heart, if Flor- ence possessed any, there was no such unjust accusa- tion-she did not believe one word that she had ut- tered, but she would not suffer defeat for an instant to daunt her. "This scene will bear me witness," she cried, " you kneel to him, and he accepts your homage! I1was not prepared for this, even at this hour-even after all I have seen -and known. Do not talk to me of gratitude, of esteem or reverence, they can not exist in a human heart coupled wiAt unselfish love and purity of in- tention!"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      161 "Madame," said Moore, "because you are cold, cal- culating and selfish, you judge the world to be the same! You would drive this young girl to desperation, force her to marry where she can not love, as others sometimes do, to the deception of those who trust them, or what would you have?" "I would have her marry, as you say, one who seeks her hand, who has honored her, so far below him, with his choice. Is this a light matter? Can you tell me why she rejects his proffered suit?" "Because' she is truthful and ingenuous-against sound principles gold can not weigh a feather I ' "Then let her seek her fortune elsewhere! No 1 I perceive how the matter lies-you advise her to re- main, and she is very willing and ready to accept- willing and ready, because of her gratitude! Why, if she possessed any, or refinement or delicacy, she would not burden those who have cherished her these ten years. To refined natures dependence is a bitter thing!" Lillian sank down in a chair and covered her face with her hands. Moore spoke angrily. "You have denied me love, the only boon I crave- you never bestowed 'the gift upon me--and have re- solved that none other shall--but I tell you," and his voice faltered, "there is one source of happiness of which you can not deprive me!" "Talk of your hidden joys," said she, scornfully, "I am not a partner to them-!" "Seek them," said he. "Learn of Lillian! If we have bestowed our worldly treasures on her-they have been more than returned."   162        LILLIAN: OR, "Elevate her- as an example to me," said Florence; "but nothing that you can say now will surprise me." "Madame,"  said Lillian, recovering herself, "I will not trouble you - any longer--accept the gratitude and benediction of a friendless orphan. One should not be dependent." "I am glad that you hsve at- last awakened -to a sense of your true position-the sooner you depart the better for our peace!" With these words she went out, shutting the door furiously behind her. Not a word was spoken for some moments-the silence was becoming painful, from its intensity! Lillian arose, irresolute: "Guardian, dear guardian, I must leave you!" There was no reply, his head drooped upon his breast, his eyeswere closed, and a cold rigidity contracted every feature of that noble countenance. There was a sudden cry, and Lillian stood beside him, bathing his temples, calling upon him to awake and speak to her just one word! It was in vain, her benefactor sat up- right, cold and motionless. With one hand still hold- ing his, so rigid and powerless, she reached forward and rang the bell loudly. It was answered by several servants at once. "Go for the doctor," said she to one; c" go and call your mistress," to another. All this was spoken calmly, dispassionately--not a symptom of the emotion in her soul was visible upon her countenance or in her manner. "I shall die," said she, mentally, " if he, my only friend, does not survive this shock; why should I wish to live?" Mrs. Moore entered the room, and approached her   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      163 husband. It was riot Lillian-it was his wife who ex- claimed most loudly. Did her conscience reproach her? Perhaps she was only acting--for the fierce tornado of her' wrath was about to burst even then upon the innocent andadevotedhead. "It has come at last to this," said she, fiercely; "you have killed my husband! Would that you had never stolen into our dwelling, and into his affections with. your soft, insinuating ways. I have not been blind all this time-I have let it ripen--;-ripen to fruit- ion. Dare not to touch him!" "Oh, madame," said she, "dear madame, this is no time for, accusation or invective. Your, husband may be dead! See, he does not move-he is cold!" and she wrung her hands in hopeless silence. "s It is you who have killed your benefactor!" A cold shuddering seized the young girl- her spirit writhed under the cruel taunts of her persecutor. What would she not sacrifice to restore that inanimate figure--and the terrible accusation made her feel like a murderess. "Oh, let me bathe his hands and brow--no one is doing anything for him-please, dear madame, let me bathe his hands and brow." "Do not give yourself any unnecessary trouble--the servants are here, and the physicians will soon arrive. You are out of place." She could not leave him-herself as cold and pale, and almost as insensible as he. There had been no movement, no- relaxation of that rigidity. The phy- sician arrived--he pronounced it paralysis-from which he could afford him temporary, if not permanentY re- lief."   164        LILLIAN: OR, "Perhaps you had better avail yourself," said Mrs. Moore, sarcastically, " of this opportunity to depart; it will not then give your benefactor unnecessary pain." "If you will let me stay and nurse him, I will do all, anything that you may require." "A very plausible, artful motive-but it is transpa- rent," "Madame," said Lillian, proudly, "I have never wronged, you in thought, word or deed--neither will I bear your false accusations." "Depart, then, without further comment-your presence has become odious." Lillian arose at the mandate, and staggered rather than walked over the rich and costly carpet, which gave no echo to her footsteps-her brain was giddy- she was suffocating for the fresh air-she was dying with memories of the past-with hopelessness of the future; casting a lingering,-and mournful look upon the postrate form of her benefactor. The physician, with the aid of the servants, had placed him upon the sofa, where he still lay motionless as a carved statue, while the physician had gone out after appliances which were not at hand-she stood there one moment, then, with a sudden gush of emotion rushed back and threw herself once more on her knees beside him. "Farewell, father," said she, "more than father. God knows I would not leave you, but I must. This world is a wide, cold place, and I shall miss your love and counsel--your sympathy and kindliness;" and without another word she glided from the room. s .   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      165 CHAPTER XI. THE life of the artist had long been lonely and iso- rated-but his fame had nevertheless spread widely. Although unconscious of his celebrity it was increas- ing rapidly. The floral tribute which had been so deli- castely tendered him, caused no other emotion than that of surprise or curiosity. There were no associations to enhance its value-it told no story of a faithful heart, and recalled no loving presence. Though elo- quent, its eloquence was unheeded. He remained all day within the studio, in accordance with the strange appointment, and at length ceased to think of it-his mind wandering far away to the sad and familiar scenes of old. There was a light footstep on the stairs, and a beautiful Italian girl entered the room, accompanied by her page. "Will you paint my portrait," said she, in a low, and musical voice. ("I should fail to depict the original," he replied, truthfully. From the moment of her appearance he had been attracted and fascinated by her brilliant and peculiar beauty. Graceful as the antelope, every movement was an embodiment of poetry--her dark eye flashed with a restless fire- but sometimes soft and tender as the dove. 'The darkness of her complexion was ren- dered dazzling by the vivid coloring of her cheeks and lips. Her hair was dark as night, and the long silken   ^l^S6'     - LILLIAXN OR, lashes of the same hue, trembled expressively on her cheeks. Her beauty was that of the diamond, united with the jet. "If it please sinor-it will please Azalie." "But I am weary of this strange land, and had de- termined to depart." "But you have friends here, although you know it not," "It is pleasant to be regarded kindly." His smile was full of silent flattery. Yes-a few are Nature's favorites." 'To some," he replied, meaningly, "she is never weary of her gifts- capricious as fortune." "You can not refuse my request. My father has long desired such a portrait. I am his only child. He will reward you munificently, and remember you grate- fully." "This one," said he, easily persuaded, "and then I must depart." "Some strong tie in another land?" said she, with a touch of sarcasm. This question startled him from a delightful dream. He gave her a penetrating glance; her eye fell; Aza- lie could not equivocate nor conceal. "As I have said before, it would be unjust to you and to my divine art-my mind is elsewhere." "But you would soon become absorbed-no one ever denies me a boon," added she, in a tone of vexation. "And I do ant like to be ungracious." "Ah, yes- you will then comply." "As it seems ,o desirable, there might be frequent sittings, and the picture soon completed."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.     167 "Any arrangement to please yourself," in a slight accent of reproach. "You may come to-morrow." "Many thanks for your self-denial." This was spoken simply, and yet full of meaning. After her departure, Travers remained in deep study. She was apparently artless, and yet some hidden sen- timent flashed through her words at times, imperfectly revealed, and he- half regretted the weakness which had rendered him compliant. There was a fascination in those splendid orbs, irresistible. She was an unrivalled subject for a painting, and upon the whole, he could not censure his determination to remain. The remain- der of the day passed in preparation for his strange visitor. Upon entering the studio, Father Ambrose found him thus engrossed. "A new subject?" said he, inquiringly, "Yes, new, brilliant and unrivaled." He related his romantic introduction to Azalie.  "She is all that you have represented." "Nothing is new to you," said Travers; "I had thought to surprise and mystify you; but she is already known, and perhaps the entire circumstance previously confided to your keeping. "Azalie has been my pupil," he replied; " her father is an old and wealthy Italian noble-his villa, the most delightful and luxurious in the country. She is heiress to his immense wealth. Don't you think her beauti- ful? she is dazzlingly so." "I could admire-but never love." "But you do not know her yet." 1.5   168      I   ,TILTTAN: OR, "Love is a divine magnetism--its attraction is in- evitable--known and felt from the very first." "Poor child! poor child!" "What do your words imply?" "They were spoken thoughtlessly. I wish you could love her." "Strange fancy! what possible benefit would it be to you or her? "Let the subject rest as it is-perhaps you do not know your heart! "Oh, no! I have neglected its study. But it will never again render me a dupe." "Still bitter over the past." "The lesson must never again be learned; once in a lifetime; let it suffice." "Man often chooses the evil, when the good is within his reach; it is inexplicable." "Father Ambrose, I am going to America." The priest arose and paced the floor with slow and thoughtful steps-apparently engrossed with some ab- sorbing theme. At last he spoke, as to himself. "It will all be made clear at last." "Yes, if we live to see and know it! I shall flee this land- of mystery." 47ther Ambrose paused in his walk, and said, earn- estly: "And I am with you." "Let it be soon!" "Very soon." Azalie did not fail to keep her appointment; looking still more beautiful han on the preceding day; no clue from  her words or manner could be obtained of that which the priest had implied. Travers did not regret   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      169 his determination to remain; her visits had become a source of pleasure. The portrait was near its comple- tion-it was her last sitting; her spirits seem to lose their elasticity. "I have come," said she, " for the last time, fearing to disappoint you. The portrait must be finisled;' " Travers made an absent reply. "But you could not have been disappointed?" "Oh, yes; I am' anxious to depart." She sighed and approached the portrait, which he had arranged upon the easel for the finishing touiches "You have been weary of this," said she, sadly, "and it has been so pleasant to me'. "I am never weary of my art."  "But it is cold," said she, passionately,.-',it is a cold and insensible art!  "You are mistaken," he replied, haughtily: "It is the divine art; the whole soul becomes engrossed with its charms. She is. a jealous- goddeSs -none Lither must share her throne ;" this was spoken with a mean- ing accent. "I have sometimes -wished that I were a goddess." The artist did not answer; he was studying the copy ,land at the same time the original. "But if I were the giddess," she continued, mus- ingly, " you would restrain your ardor and your devo- tions.     Still no answer, and she ventured: /moi'-e;: but, Tra- vers noticed there was some hiddenti'n. struggling for utterance. "Your father's villa is del!  it /aedluxurious, I have heard," said he, striving: :ft :A:-ad: her thoughts away; but he had made somehi ng of a mistake,   170        LILLIAN: OR, "Of whom have you heard," said she, quickly. He was on the point of betraying his friend, but re- plied, guardedly. "I think you intimated the same.'" "Oh, yes," she replied, dropping her eyes with the same fluctuating color; "but you would not come to see." "Duty is paramount to pleasure," said he, gallantly. "It would have been a pleasure, then?" said she, eagerly. "Yes, a pleasant recreation-for my time and thoughts are so completely occupied there is no leisure, no relief." "Is senor never home-sick," said she, inquisitively. "Yes, I am about completing my arrangements to return home very soon." Every vestige of color departed from her cheeks and lips. "Very soon?" said she, faintly. "As soon as I can master the work which lies be- fore me." He had not spoken this with regard to the portrait, but referred to other engagements which pressed upon him. "Ah, it is a sad labor," and the tears filled her eyes. "You mistake my meaning-I did not refer to your picture alone, but to others which are incomplete." Her face brightened, but during the entire sitting Travers could not elicit a word from her; she was evi- dently revolving shme dangerous topic in her mind-it flashed from her eyes, when she glanced at-the portrait or at Travers; it stole from under long lashes, when   TIIE BATTLE OF LIFE.     171 she cast them down striving to conceal it, and the slight tapping of her foot upon the floor showed how impatiently she awaited the issue. Travers strove again, but vainly, to divert' her attention, and formed the conclusion that he had a dangerous spirit to con- trol-not vindictive he hoped, and yet feared-not for his safety, that were absurd-but he knew from every unmistakable indication that the demons of jealousy and thwarted love were stirring in that unhappy bosom. He would have soothed them to peace and gentleness, but every word, softly spoken or kind, stern- or cold, only added fuel to the flame; so all conversation was resigned, and he painted while she looked on. The sun had reached the zenith, and the noontide brightness of ' his splendor poured into the window of the studio--it flooded the portrait before him with a dangerous bright- ness, lighting every feature dazzlingly. "It is alive," said he, turning to her; " could any- thing be more perfect?" And he moved back a pace to note the effect. "Do you like it?" said she, scornfully. W "We love what we create," he replied, cautiously. "Yes-yes-you are an American, I am an Italian, we can not understand each other! You are cold and phlegmatic-I am tropical and impulsive." "But," said he, kindly, "I am sure we understand each other very well." "Yes, if I did not speak--the language of the heart is transmitted by the eye. But tell me of that beauti- ful land America, from whence you came--and the American ladies-are they fair as the climate in which they are born?" "Some of them  are very beautiful," said he; "but   172        LILLIAN: OR, in a different manner from the Italians. In the land of my birth there are many impressive scenes, they are all engraven on my memory, ineffacibly. There,' said he, directirg ';her attention to a landscape, "is a faithful delineation of our autumnal forests-every rich and vivid hue here can be traced in -the foliage-of the living picture you can scarcely form conception. They are tipped with fire, burnished with gold, dressed in sombre gray, orange, crimson-all harmonizing in one beautiful whole!" "I have often sighed to visit that delightful land- tell me, is it far away'? and how soon do you return?" That simple, but significant, question revealed the current of her thoughts. "I do not know-I can not tell," he replied. "And you will make the voyage all alone?" "In company with a friend." "Oh, yes," she answered, with an assumed laugh; "a friend-a lady, to be sure-you are susceptible! I have made the important discovery!" "No, lady, simply a friend-an Italian friend!" They relapsed again into profound silence. The con- test was becoming painful. The last stroke was added to the portrait, without regret to the artist, for he was slowly but surely becoming involved. "It is finished," said he, "at last!" He stood mechanically holding the pallette and brush between the portrait and original. She arose quickly and approached the easel. "Ah, how I wish you would teach me this divine art!"Giving no opportunity for thought, much less for reply, she seized the pencil. which was still saturated with the paint, and dashed it over the entire face--not a shade of the original color   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      173 could be seen, not a line was visible, it was all one dark, indistinct, shapeless figure. "What have you done, Senorita?" said the artist, recovering his surprise. "The picture did not please me," she replied, an- grilv; "you had made the hair and eyes too dark, the face too dark; it was ugly, extremely ugly!" "But it was a true copy of the original," he replied, haughtily. The Italian girl burst into a flood of tears, "Yes," said she, passionately, "I knew you thought so, I knew you thought me ugly; you have told me nearly the same. Br t can you," said she, looking up through her tears, " can you make me beautiful-can you paint me so upon the .nvas?" Hermann dared not trust himself to reply; he was inexpressibly touched by the eloquent appeal. Seeing that she awaited his answer silently, he said at length, sadly, "Seni, ita knows, Hfear, that she is beautiful--- has not the mirror told her so? have not flatterers .^ her so?"  "But senor does not think me beautiful!" "Beauty," he replied, evasively, " must be a union of all good qualities; intrinsic merit is the only true beauty!" "I understand," said she, weeping violently, "if you think me beautiful, you think me unworthy; but you do not know." "I am but an humble artist, possessing neither rank nor brilliant fortune-my place is in the studio, cr wherever my goddess leads me; but always in obscure and unfrequented places." "I have -fortune," said she, kindlingly, "and rank to   174        LILLIAN: OR, share with one who has captivated my affections.' There was no mistaking her meaning; the pallor of her countenance was replaced by a brilliant but changing hue, the image of her thoughts, like summer clouds, chasing each other rapidly over her face. "You have spoiled the picture," he replied, " but for what reason I can not tell; better put it aside for- ever!" "Senor," she answered, huskily, "forgive me if I have spoiled the labor of weeks, but I am rich and will reward you. Will you paint another?' The attist was enlightened. "I have fulfilled my last engagement with you, senorita!" The Italian girl fell back in her chair, the image of a wild despair. "But you have promised to paint my portrait!  "The promise is redeemed!" "Senor," said she, impetuously, "I will speak! I will tell you why I spoiled the picture; because all these hours I have been sitting beside you, hearing your vqice, watching your smile, basking in the sun- light of your presence," she had arisen and stood be- fore him, with clasped, hands and imploring glances, "now it is all over, and I would give untold wealth to recall them. Say that you will forgive me this act of violence-that you will repaint the portrait-grant me one more trial--it shall not be lost! it shall not be in vain!" "Senorita," said he, emphatically, " it can not be; we must part now and forever!" She had hung upon his answer as upon the last hope --the fragment of a hope--she had waited patiently, fixedly, motionless-it came, gently as it 'had- been   175 THE BATTLE OF LIFE. spoken, like a thunderbolt. With a sharp cry of an- guish, she seized his hand, kissed it passionately, and darting through the open door, disappeared down the stairs and out into the street, whence he watched her rapidly retreating figure.   176        LTLLrAN: OR, CHAPTER XII. THE Italian nobility, as in other monarchical govern. ments, claim the highest prerogatives of power over their tenantry. The beautiful Alpine valleys smiling in the genial glow of summer, inhabited by the simple and rude peasantry, are owned by the wealthy and proud aristocrats. At the time of which we write, they had made new laws, imposed new taxes on the indus- trious but ill-starred plebeians. This had added to their other burdens a weight which was not in their power to support; they must resist, or suffer and per- haps finally meet death in a cowardly and ignominious way. Some patrician, envious of the growing wealth of his neighbors, had instigated them to rebellion. The flaming torch of discord had been lighted among them, while secret meetings and conclaves attested the grow- ing spirit of resistance. They had mutually agreed that on a certain night there should be a general insur- rection-not only in one valley, but among all the neighboring hills and lowlands. Blood should be shed, enough to wipe out their indignities and the thraldom under which they groaned. Some nobles should be spared; not intending a general massacre, a few victims would satiate their thirst for blood, and awe the remain:- ing aristocracy into gentleness and condescension. This was the secret which had been disclosed to Father Am- brose at the confessional. The vow of his sacerdotal office alone imposed the strictest silence; but, added to this, there was another, Which would have made the   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      1" revelation double perjury. While he loved and would befriend the simple peasantry, yet he respected the no- bility, and was at a loss to reconcile the approaching feud. He had refused his countenance or sanction to the conspiracy, but this had no effect upon the design of the irritated plebeians-he had resolved to brave the danger-to be present at the outhreak, and stifle the flame of .indignation and fury before it spread to any extent through the hitherto peaceful city. But the magnitude and danger of the enterprise pressed upon him sorely; he was pale and worn, his step had lost its elasticity or firmness, his forehead became contracted with a frown, and his eyes, habitually so clear and earnest, were downcast and clouded. None noticed the change but his friend Travers, or if noticed it was un- mentioned. , The subject had not been approached be- tween the friends, since its first announcement; the priest had casually reminded Travers, however, that he was bound to him by a solemn oath -not as if he feared it would be forgotten or violated-but as if the subject lay near his heart. After the decisive return of the money to Azalie, Travers 'had  received no: news from  that quarter, and they seemed to glide along peacefully; the picture had been entirely removed from the studio; its associations were dark and painful, and he hoped still never to see the brilliant buts impulsive being who had crossed his pathway with so many evil omens. In other respects, he had been extremely prosperous in this foreign land-it had become dear to: him-its mountains and valleys, its wide and diversified beauty, and his spirit kindled with-enthusiasm in the midst of such scenery-he should bear it away with' him-but time   and distance would -dim all these de   178        LILLIAN: OR, lightful memories. They had, however, wrought a magical effect upon his pencil, having acquired that for which he had labored-proficiency and fame! Their arrangements were conducted simultaneously and with expedition. Unfortunately, the execution of their de- sign to depart at an early day was thwarted by unto- ward circumstances. Father Ambrose became more depressed than ever. "I perceive," said he, " that I am destined to remain. I had hoped, how earnestly! to leave this land of trouble and all the storms that menace it! God avert them from our heads!" "Whatever you fear, and it must be some terrible calamity to affect you thus, be assured that we are in His hand!" Father Ambrose arose and paced the floor, with an agitated stiep. "I can not bring my mind,'" said he, shuddering, " to the contemplation of this theme! How far its evil effects may be attributable to me can not be decided. And yet, do not misunderstand me. I have had no secret hand in it--my neutrality is all for which I re- proach myself. But I have' vacillated from one side to the other, until it is too late to retract." "I can neither counsel nor console, for I am yet in ignorance." "Would that you might remain so! I will not re- turn to my home to-night again--for you know, my friend, it is in the hands of others. The hour ap- proaches in which the mystery shall be revealed." Travers inquired as to the disposition of his library, the parsonage, and all his estate-adding, that it was not likely they should ever return. The rectory,        THE BATTLE OP LIFE.      179 and all its appurtenances had been donated to the church, to the successor of Father Ambrose, and what was more remarkable, he would then resign his charac- ter of priest; not without some compunctious visitings and resolutions to a stern and vigilant morality. - As time wore away, and night approached, his manner be- came restless and agitated, pausing to listen, at every sound, while he exclaimed many times, Would it were over--would it were over!" They were sitting together on a verandah that over- looked the placid waters of a clear and beautiful stream, of that peculiar color, cerulean, caused by the reflection of the sky. "It is the last Italian sunset we shall ever witness," said Travers; " there is something always melancholy in the idea of change from one land to another, from one house to another; from the present associations to those which are remote." "Your nature is somewhat tinged with the hue of melancholy," said the priest.        "Not that- I am ever hopeless or despairing; but the beautiful, the grand, the sublime, always awaken feel- ings of solemnity. They are above us-they are be- yond us-the soul is lifted up-it is carried away from the material to the spiritual!" "Hark!" said Father Ambrose, " what-is that cry?" Both started to their feet and rushed to the extreme end of the verandah, whence they could obtain a view of the street. The uproar increased, and through the twilight they could faintly distinguish individuals hur- rying to and fro, and a mad shout, "The nobles-the nobles-down with the nobles!"  "It has come-no longer a secret," said Father Am   180        TTT4TAN: OR, brose, hurriedly; " there is an insurrection among the peasantry against the nobility. Let us do what we can to appease the infuriated mob! Remember your pledge!"  "I fear there can be very little effected now; matters have reached this terrible crisis-but I am with you in any event!" The face of the priest was deadly pale, but his man- ner was calmer and more composed than it had before been. They were soon in the street mingling with the crowd, hurried on side by side, surging with the rioters, who were evidently intent on destruction and massacre. They soon learned that their first onset was to be at the house of Senor Constantine. The vail of twilight was slowly lifted-though it can scarcely be termed twilight in that country, the period is so brief. And still the insurrectionists continued to shout, "Down with the nobles-freedom to the peasant-liberty or death!" "Wfat good can we effect? said Travers, "in this mad populace!" "Let us wait and see," was ,the whispered reply. The mob were armed with cudgels, torches, and deadly weapons; evidently they were not all peasants, but the lower ranks of citizens. "Let us fire his dwelling!" shouted one. "Let us exterminate the whole race," said another, "Softly," replied a third, more moderate than his companions, "let us see if he will capitulate." "No mercy, no mercy!" cried many voices at once. The majority were for massacre and destruction. Ambrose and his friend were almost borne aloft on the shoulders of the crowd, so great was the pressure, till   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      181 they stood before the fated villa. Extricating them- selves, with great effort, from the nob, they rushed to an upper verandah, where a view could be obtained of the whole proceedings. The inhabitants had either fled or concealed themselves in terror. There appeared no concerted plan of action among the insurgents. Some were for firing the dwelling itself; others for pilfering, and the more lawless for actual massacre. "Let us search them out," said they, with fearful oaths; "not one shall escape our fury! hang them! burn them!" The moon had risen, shining palely on the faces of the wild crowd-white with anger, or crimson with ex- citement. ; What shall stay these turbulent, wayward spirits?" said Travers. In the general riot and confusion they had hitherto been unnoticed, but now their situation was becoming precarious. There they are! there they are!" shouted several with one voice, pointing to the sable figures, which seemed to be no part of the insurrectionists. The priest had assumed his robe, deeming that his sacred character would do more toward awing them into sub- jection than words or deeds. "He is a priest! dare not to harm him,' said some one. There was a general silence--rFather Ambrose seized the opportunity to address them in a calm, earnest, and energetic manner. The sway of the priesthood is almost supreme-and they listened for a short time with respectful attention, while he urged upon, them the Christian duty of forbearance; alleging that the   182        LILLIAN: OR, nobility would soon perceive that their system of tax- ation was injurious to their own interests--that they would be reduced, and the former easy rates adopted. "Down with the nobles! down with the nobles!"' they vociferated, loudly. "And he is their friend," said some. But all this time they stood irresolute. "Who shall shrive your souls?" said the priest, in a clear, ringing tone, that carried dismay into the dis- orderly ranks. "Disperse, return to your' homes," said he, authoritatively; " let the majesty of the law be vindicated!" "Let us kill that pale faced American," cried all. "We'll have no foreign intervention!' "Look out how you harm an American," said one. ( Oh, America has lost her prestige of independence and glory!" "It is false, she is still powerful and prosperous." "He has no right to interfere. Down with him!" Several pistols were pointed at Travers, who faced the danger, resolutely. As these words were uttered, there was a sharp, wild cry of anguish through the air from the interior Qf the mansion, and the beautiful Italian girl rushed out and threw herself before her lover. "Save him! save him!" cried she; " he is innocent- he has not harmed you! my life for his!" There was another mad shout from the mob. "Ah, the beautiful Azalie! she must have jewels and laces, ease and luxuries wrung from the veins of the poor--their life-blood. She shall atone." Shots were fired, and the burning torches applied to the light frame of the dwelling, which threatened in-   THE BATTLE OF tIFE.      188 stant conflagration, while some of the bolder made a rush to the upper portion of the building, intending to wreak their vergeance on the innocent, but hapless maiden. "Dare not to approach," said Ambrose, boldly and solemnly; "dare not to approach a woman. The ter- rors of the lost are in store for the disobedient." With his arm extended, he held them at bay; there was a calm majesty upon his brow and in his eye, which would have enchained the boldest, maddest populace. The beautiful Azalie still- knelt, clasping her lover's feet-gazing up to him with looks of the deepest de- votion, even in that awful hour. "Rise, senorita," said he, as the crowd surged back, overawed by the priest's attitude and words; " rise, this, is unbecoming your womanly position and rank." ':I would remain here forever," said she, softly. He took her arm, and disengaging himself from her embrace, raised her gently from the ground. "We must fly! we must fly!" said the priest; "the : flames are rapidly cutting off all egress-we shall be  involved." "But ydur friends, senorita," said Travers, in a whisper, "where are they?"  "Safe, safe, thank heaven!'" "Then, why are you here?" "I saw you, senor, and knowing your danger, could not leave."' "Lose no :time,"' said Father Ambrose, "we are lost!" then turning once more to the crowd, exclaimed in a deep, sonorous voice: "Behold your work! let this suffice! it is enough! Dare to proceed no farther, 16   184        TTLTTAlN: OR, or I will cut off every soul of you from the church on earth, and from the abodes of the blessed on high." They were entirely subdued by the threat, or there was a movement among them to disperse. All this had happened with greater rapidity than we can write or read. Flying down the burning stair-way, Father Ambrose and Hermann Travers supported and bore along the almost insensible figure of the Italian girl. They passed through the crowd unmolested, partly owning to the darkness, or to the desire of gain, which inspired the mob; they had rifled the villa of its wealth and costly ornaments. The arrival of a company of Ita- lian " gens d'armes," successfully stayed the work of pil- lage and quelled the riot; but not until it had progressed far-destroying every vestige of the noble villa, which had stood so proudly in the light of the rising sun on that eventful day. "Tell us, Azalie," said Travers, " where are your friends, that we may place you in their keeping." "I can not reveal, senor," said she. "But have we not proven ourselves tried friends," said Father Ambrose, proudly. "Yes-I will tell you; they have sought shelter and safety in the convent. But when do you leave Milan?" "To-morrow." "That is very soon," said she, with a sigh; "promise me one more meeting, and I am satisfied!" It was a long time before Travers could reply-he did not know how to refuse her, and yet he dared not comply. Ambrose, perceiving the difficulty, came to his relief. "Daughter, go in peace, our prayers and benedic- tions will follow you forever."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      185 "Just once more," pleaded she. "I will come to bid you a long farewell-to thank you for the kindness which you have shown a stranger this night." They parted at the door of the convent, where her friends received her joyfully-they had, awaited her arrival with the greatest anxiety, and in a state nearly bordering on distraction. Father Ambrose, in answer to their eager inquiries of the work of demolition, did not conceal the truth, but broke it gently to the fugi- tives. The noble did not mourn uselessly the loss of his villa, knowing well that it had not impoverished him-only revealing the hidden sentiments of his ten- antry.  It effected something, however, of good on both sides, showing of what inflammable materials the masses are composed. The taxes were withdrawn. The peasantry, filled with -remorse, and subjected to a wearisome system of penance by their ghostly fathers, the principal conspirators were seized by the authori- ties and thrown into prison. The moon went down that night on a smoking ruin. Of the blooming gar- . den that surrounded and adorned the valley, nothing remained but a barren waste. Their delightful home was among the ruins of the past. But this did not disturb the thoughts nor slumbers of the Italian maiden. They were fixed only on one-that one about to depart from her forever, and the painful reality flashed over, her mind with a  certainty of fulfillment. She would forsake home-friends-country-all for his sake, if that were permitted her. But he would never respond to her sentiments-she was assured they were not bound by any reciprocity-she had no claim upon his   i86        LILLIAN: OR, gratitude or sympathy, and nothing could prevent his untimely departure. But while she tossed restlessly, and could not sleep, a sudden suggestion flashed over her mind-one of those visitings which are created by some foreign agency--a- newI resource was opened to, her fertile mind; the idea pleased and consoled her, assuming a tangible shape, resolving itself into a concerted plan. She arose and walked to the window, inhaling with deep inspirations delightful draughts of the cool night air. Every sound was hushed in the convent, the bell had ceased to toll, the lights were extinguished, the voice of prayer and supplication no longer resounded, there was not a footstep, not a murmur, but that which like a spirit whisper stole up from the garden below. The moon was high in the heavens, and that inexpres- sible thrill, when we stand in the moonlight, calm, clear, cold, as if in the presence of some invisible be- ing, awed her into silent contemplation of the scene. Was he sleeping? dreaming? No--there are strange  coincidences in our lives-he was awake and thinking, too, of her; wherever he turned, there was that lovely young form bowed low before him, embracing his knees, kissing the earth upon which he, stood----such homage, endangering her own life for his, could not fail to touch his heart. And what had he to render in return? Absolutely nothing-no love-but hopeless separation. He almost fancied that he could- take-her to his home with the endearing epithet of bride and-wife! Then the scene in the studio--the passionate, Unhappy scene-the spoiled portrait and impetuous avowal- these were sure. indications of a generous but untutored spirit. He felt that such an union might be ruinous   THE BATTLE OF',LIFE.     187 to both-to her, who needed a calm, steady, guiding hand-to him, a congenial spirit--one who 'could ad- vise and- elevate, with whom, hand in hand, he might walk over the earth on his pilgrimage; with whom, hand in hand,;he might at last sit down in the eternal kingdom. It could not be the Italian girl, and a pang of remorse visited his conscience, because he felt thus and could not reciprocate her love-because he felt it to be a priceless gift, far above any other; that which she had bestowed on him, and he was about to' cast it away. Could the beautiful vision ever be recalled? Should he meet any other half as worthy? Disturbed and tortured, the morning broke before he closed his, weary eyes in sleep, and then images of the mad riot ae had witnessed-haunted .him, and ho was continually reacting the scenes of the preceding day. His first thought on awaking was of the interview which could not be avoided, and that it might be over and his mind at ease, he'prepared to face the difficulty with resolu- tion and alacrity. The family- of Constantine were still sheltered by the friendly walls of the convent;,now that all fears of the insurrectipnists had subsided, they could look around calmly upon the wreck which had been wrought. It must be many years before the villa could present the same inviting aspect that it had done previously to the riot; but they consoled themselves that their lives were spared, and that their estate was sufficient, independently of lineage, to place them in the ranks of the nobility. Isabella had adorned her- self with the utmost care for the occasion; roses, crim- son and white, contrasted with the dark brightness. of her hair; they trembled on her bosom, making more lustrous the vivid tints of her complexion. Travers   188        LILLIAN: OR, gazed and gazed, not with the boldness which charac- terizes some, but with those stolen glances which be- token profound admiration. It was seen by Isabella, who secretly congratulated the fascination, which she deemed complete-a dangerous fascination it was truly, a spell which he could scarcely break, although reason struggled for the mastery. "I shall long treasure the remembrance of your kindness, senor," said she, in a low, musical voice; "your moral courage in braving the mad conspiracy which threatened to overwhelm us! But how came you there?" "I should have been an ungrateful monster," he was forgetting himself, " if I had not desired and endeav- ored to procure your safety, senorita." ".Ah,' said she, with a kindling blush and a smile, "you thought of me?" He was silent for a moment, and at length replied: "Do not bestow your praise and gratitude on me, senorita--it is all due to Father Ambrose-you are aware that I knew nothing of your father's villa," said he, coldly, "having never visited it; but your kind Italian friend has shown his generous bravery in de- feating the wild purpose of the insurrectionists." Her countenance fell and darkened, but the shadow fled as it had come, instantaneously. "I never could understand you. A brave and gene- rous action merits our reward, but you will not even let me thank you; and the portrait,' said she, reproach- fully, " you would accept nothing for that! Perhaps it was not sufficient remuneration for your labor?" "The portrait is valueless," said he. "But rendered so by my action. I shall not think   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      189 you forgive me, unless the money is accepted  It has been so all my life-doing that which I would undo- saying that which I wish unsaid.

Impulsive natures are ever generous. They contain qualities, extreme qualities, either for evil or for good!" She had hung upon his words almost breathless. "But the guiding hand," she replied, " will ever- ever remain wanting-where can I look-to whom shall I turn? My father and mother are religious, they are kind and affectionate, but have never- taught me these things, which L should love to learn. The guiding hand," she repeated, thoughtfully. He could not misunderstand her-it was written on her countenance, expressed in every word. "There is one guide for all."  "I know," she repeated, pettishy, " but I have not learned the way-my. nature 1i wild and untutored--at the same time ardent and grateful! I can not say that which I do not think, nor refrain my lips from speak- ing that which is in my heart.

Beware how you answer! your words must seal the warrant for life or death!" Travers felt that -hf spoke the truth-upon his decision depended her')om--it was in his power; he must sacrifice his happiness to hers, or hers to his; more thoroughly convinced than ever that it was a dangerous foundation upon which to build. "You have my best wishes for you happiness and prosperity-my gratitude for your generosity and fa- vorable opinion." "And is that all?" said she, passionately. "All I have to bestow." She started up, while her eyes flashed fire, and the hue of her cheeks was a burning crimson. s -  ( aYou have spoken my fate-beware, if it be not your own! You are going to America, and fancy you will there be rid of Azalie, the Italian girl! but the ghost of those we have wronged or injured haunt us even from the unseen shore! Beware!" Travers gazed at her wonderingly-but unmoved- in silence.  "Let us part friends," said he, "I would like to bear away a pleasant remembrance of the Italian girl!" He extended his hand, but she dashed it rudely aside, exclaiming: "I do not want your friendship-- it is a cold, un-i- meaning token-a trifling gift in exchange for the de- votion of a lifetime. I will not accept it; we are more than friends or we are-enemies "'   THE BATTLE O0 LIFE.      191 "Bear ine witness," said-Travers,-" that I have acted conscientiously-that never, by word or deed, have -I given occasion for your present violence-your love or hatred. Be persuaded of my good will. You are young and beautiful--there are many who would repay your love with an equal devotion." "Say no more,' said she,Aornfully, "I appreciate your advice, and will striveto act upon it." "Farewell, then," said he, gently, I can never for- get you, nor would I wish to forget, for your name is associated with many delightful -umdiories." "You can say soft things,' said she, scornfully; "beware! how you rouse the demon in my heart! You will not forget-you shall not forget!" and she burst into a passionate flood of tears. He saw it was useless to stay the torrent-it would soon be exhausted, having afforded its temporary relief. He rose to depart without another word. "I will not say farewell," said she, " remember I do not say farewell!" He did not turn to look at her, but her significant words rung in his ears for many days. "Unhappy child," said Father Ambrose, pityingly; "it is the fault of our nation-it is the fault of her impulsive nature--of her early education. It is unfor- tunate that you have met." "Yes, and as fortunate that we have parted forever." But what did her last words indicate?"'She would not say farewell, and he knew there was some hidden meaning in the depths of her flashing eye-in her sig- nificant warning. He endeavored vainly, in the excite- ment of change, to find relief. It was but an impulse with her-she would soon forget him, or seek some 17   192        r, TTLTAN: OR, more congenial lover. Every one in Milan and through- out the country had heard of the great artist-not only the fame of his art preceded him, wherever he went, but admired and courted- by all, he still shrunk from flattery and observation. The Milanese had showered innumerable benefits upon him, for his private charac ter was known and appreciated; while, the farewells and congratulations of hig friends pressed tenderly upon him. ,In all these, Father Ambro3e was not forgotten, but shared equally and liberally. As I have before said, he was no longer a priest, having resigned the sacerdotal office, previous to his departure. With min- gled emotions of joy and sadness they left the city where their friendship had commenced--strengthened and cemented by time and circumstances.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      193 CHAPTER XIII UPON leaving the house of her guardian, Lillian instinctively turned her footsteps to the neighboring mansion. There was little even to attract her, only that it was. the home of her sister. Perhaps she felt more desolate than she had ever felt. Would not Mrs. Carroll believe her own daughter in preference to her- self; and how could she disprove her statements% or establish .her own innocence? The scene around her was tranquil, beautiful-the fountain bubbled up coolly, and dripped with a tinkling sound into the marble basin beneath. The warm   sunlight lay on the green lawn unbroken,  Why was she doomed to be a wanderdr? Why could she not claim a home, one quiet little nook, where the world shouldl be forgotten--hallowed by love and blessings?. She hesitated-she feared to enter- but desperation gave a sort of courage, and a shadowr to her   usually  pale countenance. She did not see Eva, and scarcely desired to do so--hoping faintly for one kind word from her gentle friend, Mrs. Carroll. The latter greetediher kindly and warmly. "But, Lillian, you look very pale." "Mr. Moore is sick;!" "Singular that you did not tell of it before," said Betsey, drily., "What is the cause of his sickness?" inquired Mrs. Carroll, quickly..  "No less than paralysis:!"   194         LILLIAN: OR, Mrs. Carroll turned very pale. ( There is hope of him, madame, there is hope!" "She knows more than she is willing to tell," said Betsey, again. Lillian stood for a few minutes irresolute--con- founded ; at last, with a sudden, desperate movement, started forward, and flinging herself before Mrs. Car- roll, exclaimed, passionately! "You will not believe it! you can not believe it. Oh, dear madame, if the breath of calumny should tarnish my fair name, do not listen to it! Think of me as Lillian-the little Flower Girl-the unfortunate, friendless orphan! Think of me kindly, I implore!" "The girl is going mad!" exclaimed Betsey. "Rise, Lillian, there is no occasion for this great emotion; what has happened?" "Too soon you will hear a false and wicked accusa- tion alleged against me! and I ask you solemnly to discredit it." "When it is disproved!" said Betsey. "Farewell, dear madame, remember what I have told you, and be merciful." And she was gone. Amid the conflicting emotions that shook her soul, Lillian remembered reading an advertisement of a. wealthy lady for a governess; and endeavoring unsuc- cessfully to control her sorrow, she hastened rapidly to seek the situation for herself. It was not difficult to obtain-the fashionable and careless lady knowing well- that Lilian had been educated by Mr. Moore, she was therefore accepted-and with her breaking heart-- breaking from its weight of sorrow concealed from mortal eye, her arduous and perplexing duties were   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      195 commenced. Each succeeding day she was at th6 door of Mr. Moore's' mansion, seeking information of his health, and was somewhat relieved to learn his con- valescence. But he was very weak and lonely. Sometimes his gaily dressed wife, attired for some brilliant festival, would come to bid him good night-- lier flashing beauty enhanced and adorned with gems and various little ornaments, known only to a woman's toilette. As she stood by him in the pride of her charms, with his weary eye fixed sadly and admiringly upon her, he would say: "Could you not stay with me to night, Florence?" ' Oh, I will return soon!" "But the time passes fleetly to one who is young and well; the unfortunate are soon forgotten." A light laugh was the only reply. With the rustling of silk, the glitter of gems, the fragrance. of roses, she would glide from the room. A mornful sigh was his sad farewell, listening to the sound of the carriage as it rolled away. The moon and stars were his only companions in those solitary hours; then, more than ever, x, missed the presence of his better angel-he could apprexat all of her little kindly attentions-he could recall the parting scene, vividly--remembering how that unjust accusation must rankle in her sweet and innocent spirit, which he desired-to shield from every sorrow and contumely-but had signally failed; one thing he determined upon doing-of donating a :portion of his estate to her support--this was a-pleas- ant reflection, and softened the asperity of his lot, ima- gining her delight and gratitude, not only at the recep- tion of the gift, but at the love and remembrance which A  prompted it. His wife had returned from her last bril. \   196        LILLIAN: OR, liant assemblage--her step was more elastic, and a vivid color hightened the beauty of her complexion. She was usually weary and disspirited, retiring without visiting the chamber -of her sick husband. She awak- ened him from a delightful dream; starting up, he gazed wildly upon the beautiful vision which had been conjured into his presence. "When did you return," said he, languidly. "I have been at home nearly half an hour," was the reply, as she consulted a jeweled repeater, which hung beside her in its velvet case. "You entered the room very silently, or it would have awakened me; but it is very kind in you to re- member me to-night." "You have not been lonely, I hope?" "Not unusually so; but I am very weary with this tedious, lingering sickness; if I could only go out once more before the summer fades." "But you do not ask me anything of the party-it was the most brilliant affair of the season. Every one was there--the greatest display of jewels, and rich e- tire-the most enchanting music-the fines; entertain- ment-and who do you think has rf*,rlned?" "I can not tell." An artist who has been in Italy for the past ten years; he brings with him a friend-native of that beautiful country-they are carrying all hearts-capti- vating every fancy ; there is an indescribable charm in their conversation and: manner. You know that 'this,  was a fancy dress, and I must tell you that the chief' admiration and attraction of the evening was a gipsey girl-no one knew her name or whence she came. She was attired in a dress of crimson silk-a girdle of dia-   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       197 monds flashed from her slender and graceful boddice, by which the robe was -confined at the waist. A cir- cle of rubies, amidi the darkness of her splendid hair, which hung in long and silken ringlets-ear-rings of rubies and diamonds, and white satin slippers encasing the tiniest of feet, completed the elegant and unique at- tire. She glided about like a shadow after these two gentlemen of whom I have been telling you--at last, she fell on her knees before the artist, and caught his hand, saying, in a clear, soft, sweet Italian voice, that she could read his fortune. A crowd of expectant, lis- tening ones gathered about the actress. Travers, for that is the artist's name, started back as if stung by an adder--dashing her hand aside and indicating that she must first tell some fair lady's fortune. With a motion, eager and rapid as his own, she sprung to her feet, and snatching a jeweled dagger from the girdle, flashed it before his eyes, saying with a wild laugh: 'Beware! beware! the gipsies are a jealous race! I would tell your fortune, sir, artist.' The Italian came immediately to his relief, and extended his palm to this reader of destiny; she took it with an impatient gesture, and traced the lines rapidly: 'Once a wayward, reckless youth;  Once a priest-dispensing truth I Once a substance bright and fair, Only shadow now you wear l You will wed, ere long i ween, One whom you have never seen i' ' The Italian, whose name I learned was Tricilli, ap- peared to feel her measures keenly-particularly her first oracles, relating to the past. Some ladies then   198        LILLIAN ;. OR, ventured upon testing her skill in necromancy, but she insisted first on tellingthat of the artist. The company then began to rally him upon his reluctance to read the future, or to have the past revealed. Driven by this un- meaning badinage to that which he had before declined, he accepted the gipsey's challenge. We noticed even amid the crowd of observers that the manner and atti- tude of the gipsey varied-now proud and scornful- now; soft and tender and languishing-then reproachful and again wild and unmeaning. 'Slighted by an early love- This inclined your head to rove I All the world lay spread before, Fame and love and shining ore 1 All you have at last obtained Two have cherished-one disdained? Fame and wealth, but love, alas I All her gentle dreams must pass 1 One there is not far away, Who shall grace your bridal day- But within your palm is seen, Fearful shadows lie between I Oh, beware! Fate is not kind, She must sever, ere she bind.' "It almost seemed to affect the artist more even than it had his friend-the pallor of his cheek was not concealed-and a sort of shuddering seized his frame. The gipsey, perceiving the power of her words, gave a wild laugh, brandished the dagger menacingly over her head, and then plunged it into her diamond girdle. She was soon lost in the mazes of the giddy waltz-never one waltzed before like her. So light and graceful-so perfect in time and movement-it was fascinating to behold her. Every eye became riveted on the beau-   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.   -    9 tiful stranger. Subsequent to the delivery of the oracles by the gipsey girl, Travers and Tricilli left the assem- bly, and we saw no more of that: strange being, who must have followed either the one or the other." Moore had remained motionless during his wife's narrative-with his eyes closed, one would have said he slumbered--but not a word escaped him-until she paused. "Have you ever seen these strangers before," he fixed his mild but penerating eye upon her. "To which do you refer," she anwered his ques- tion evasively, by asking another: "To either or to both?" "Oh, I have seen Travers before, he was a citizen of this place!" The gaze was not withdrawn; a more superficial ob- server would not have noticed any emotion on her countenance, which had been so perfectly schooled to concealment, but he could read all he desired, even in her evasive reply, in her averted and troubled glance-- troubled, because she knew he was reading all that she desired to conceal-her early engagement with that famous artist-the old flame which his recent appear- ance had revived-her plans to'win him over to herself, to steal his affections, and complete the ruin which once she had commenced.  "You acknowledge having seen the artist-and the Italian, what of him?"  "I know very little of him, save what the gipsey has revealed?" "Can you not answer the question directly?  "His countenance is like one I have met before, per- haps the same!"   200        LILLIAN: OR, "Your memory is becoming inefficient-the decline of youth is unfavorable to this gift." "Yes, you must have found it so.*" She had turned the tables- upon her antagonist. The ticking of the watch might be heard distinctly at this interval in their conversation. "Will you not be well enough to go down' stairs be fore long?" "Dr. Henry forbids the attempt at present," said he, with a deep sigh. ' But I think he is too exacting; a change of scene might effect more than all the drugs he can prescribe." Now he was wondering what strange fancy had taken hold upon her. That this movement did not consult his own good or pleasure; perhaps she would make the matter clear. "Do you wish me to go down stairs?" "Oh, yes-it is so dull down there!" The words sounded strangely musical in his ear, and he lay still for a while, beguiling himself with the sweet thought that he had won her heart at last, but io! it was a delusion; she was the same deceptive being--it was the old story of a point to gain! "It would be so delightful to invite these strangers here, you would enjoy their society vastly "  There, the secret was 6ut-all her consideration was for herself, under a pretense of love to him. "It will be some time, Florence, before I am able to join in the festivity which so fascinates and delights you!" "It never does one any good to brood over their sorrows; you require society and a change of scene!" He sighed deeply. There was some society of which   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      201 he would have been very glad-that of his friends-- particularly Lillian's--she had known this and denied it to him. Then it would have cheered and refreshed him, the gentle, loving presence whom he had called bride, so changed and deceptive; perhaps she read his thoughts, hastening to interrupt them in a tone of gen- tle reproach. "I had thought you would not deny me this pleasure!" "What time do you have to think, Florence?" He put the question gravely and affectionately. "I was always averse to the labor of thinking. Life is made for pleasure, and we are made for life-there- fore, we are made for pleasure-' "The same old argsaetnt-do you not perceive its fallacy? But- I will tell you that I am prepared to grant your request, if you concur with my wishes." Do you wish to deliver one of your sermons, or shall I?" "Nothing of the kind--a request in favor of myself; and to come to the point, if you give this party you must invite Lillian.'" The face of Mrs. Moore was shadowed and overcast, as the sky by a tempest; she frowned, bit her lip, and strove in vain to conceal the anger and jealousy which rankled in her bosom. "Oh, you need not comply," said he, with a tone of indifference; "I am not at all anxious to be disturbed in the little repose which I have at present, by your festivity-you well know that they are not in accordi ance with my taste or feelings." "You have grown so morose! Lillian would be' en' firely out of place-she would not enjoy herself here!"   202        LILLIAN: OR, ' That is a secondary consideration, madame; if it be disagreeable to you, do not let us pursue the subject further!  "You will always carry your point," said she, pet- tishy; "but I am not informed of Miss Rosebrough's whereabouts." "Mrs. Carroll might assist you in that respect; but then we will not trouble ourselves further about the matter; and I am weary-it is almost morning;" he closed his eyes in accordance with his words. "Well, we will not quarrel about so trifling an affair; let us consider it 'agreed." "Mind," sala he, with a sharp glance of his blue eye, "there shall not be airy deception in the compromise!,' "Perhaps, if we can not nllst each other," she re- plied, haughtily, "the contract nh better be with- drawn!" "Just as you please!" "The most perverse, ungrateful of men-how many thousands envy you this position-how many to whom the hand of kindness would not need a second time to be extended! but you are incorrigible!" "Ah, Florence, once I trusted and believed! but some one has foolishy taught me better!" "Do not let us quarrel!" she gave him her hand, and bidding him good night went out, saying, "A con- tract is inviolable." He smiled at the readiness of her compliance, know- ing that she would not be denied her favorite scheme of amusement, let the sacrifice be ever so great at which it was procured. The suggestion was a happy one, bringing the first ray of light that had shone upon his weary soul for many long and painful days. He knew   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      203 that she would not dare to break the contract, however much of a struggle it might cost her. The balm which it afforded his depressed and wounded spirit produced a salutary effect; he fell into a light and refreshing slumber, although the dawn was about to break, and on the following- morning when the physician called he pronounced him convalescent, his prescriptions having had the desired effect-he should see the face dearest on earth to him-he should hear her speak, and know all the sympathy she felt. He should learn where she had fled, to what refuge, and respond to all her sorrows, as she did to his! These thoughts were sustenance to him all the day; he had not yet learned upon what day his wife intended to give the grand fete-it was con- ceded that Eva should be invited also, on her mother's account, and because her sister would be there; the subject under consideration had been brought to a speedy conclusion, and Moore impatiently waited the event; and Lillian, having been apprisedc by Eva, con- sented for two reasons--the opportunity it "afforded her of meeting her beloved guardian, and the desire also to please her sister. *^  .

The recesses were -filled with the fragrance- and bloom of flowers, and sweet odors, varied and delightful, cooled by the gentle breath of heaven, wafted through the open win-i dow, lifting theelegant drapery with a sigh. Is there a corner of the globe--a scene in which there is no sacred and silent influence at work? Amid the flash of diamonds and the glitter of lamps, the exciting mu- sic, the heat of the dance, upon entering this retired spot, the reveler turned to catch the inspiration from without--turned to the zephyr for coolness-a single pale- ry of moonlight stole in as an accompaniment, falling- on the gayly-colored carpet, as upon a garden of roses. No expense had been spared to render it the most delightful fete given in honor; of the returned hero. The mistress of this enchanted palace could not fail to excite the admiration of every beholder; richly, but plainly, attired, having laid aside her diamonds for that night, substituting ornaments of pearl and jet, with a dress of heavy white silk, the excitement f the scene, or the aid of art, had imparted a delicate fresh- ness to her complexion-always affable and graceful, placing every one at ease in her house, she was une- qualed as a hostess.

She was dressed, according to her early intention, in as simple and pure white dress, a ,white rose, entwined with a, damask, ornamented the waves of her glossy chestnut hair kissing her cheek with a graceful motion; a spray of scarlet geraniums trembling on her bosom, were her only jewels--those only which were apparent to the observer-but a critic might have seen a rarer jewel shining in the depth of her soft, gray eyes, lighting up he .intenance with a spiritual beauty. Eva, in contrast with her sister, wore a dress of rose-colored tissue; pearls, the gift: of her generous benefactress, added their soft lustre to the heavy braids of hair surmounting her brow--a. natural coronal. As Lillian gaaziaupon her sister, she seemed a vision of angelic loveliness, such as she had never beheld--there was no pang' of jealousy at the difference in their attire-it was rather a feeling of joy, of a mother tpoward her child. "You surpass yourself, my Eva, to-night," said she. They entered the carriage. "If Mrs. -M ore hbad only been as liberal toward you,". was the whispered reply!. "Oh, I shall do very well; you will not be proud of me to -be sure ;" she sighed a faint sigh, but soon re- covered her elasticity and quiet serenity of heart and, manner. "It seemed so strangely-to me, that, we should. be here, Lillian." The oisters sat stdef by side in the carriage, and un- noticed by Mr, Ca rrol, :carried onf their: conversation.: - in wihsgeir bptte quikk ear Aunt -Betsey detected f    206        LILLIAN: OR, the sound, and her sharp eye, even amid the darkness, penetrated their retirement. "This is no time for trifling, miss," she was address- ing Lillian; " it seems to me you are scarcely competent to govern the young, if you have not learned the first principles of politeness!" A merry smile parted Eva's lips, but Lillian held up her finger in warning. Aunt Betsey saw it all and did not allow the opBptunity of doing good to pass unim- proved. The le;e  delivered in a shrill, ringing tone, ceased only with the motion of the carriage, and con- cluded with the trite remark: "I hope you will not make yourselves too conspicu- ous-young ladies should never forget their modesty!" As much accustoimed as Lillian had been to these brilliant tirades, it pi46duced a fearful effect upon her nerves. A crowd of varied emotions pressed upon her mind. She had not entered that dwelling, since it had ceased to be her home. What joy and sorrow had then- been hers! There could'be no doubt but the hostess would receive her politely, as among the number of in- vited guests. Every vestige of color had fled from her cheek, leaving it pale as the white rose that trembled amid her hair. "Do not be annoyed, dear Lillian, it is only Aunt Betsey; you remember how angry she made me when I was a child, calling us little dirty beggars," said Eva, with a gay laugh, as they tripped up the flight of mar- ble steps. Lillian passed her hand over her brow to drive away the troubled cloud which had settled -there. "Oh, it will be delightful by and by, Lillian, and the artist will be here!"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      207 Her manner did a great deal toward influencing her less vivacious sister, and before they left the dressing- room her color had returned, and a soft smile, peaceful and holy as the moonlight, shed its rippling magic-light over her face and brow. It was not a very cordial re- ception, surely; a forced smile, a bow, were' the only compliments from the hostess. Could these innocent girls have looked into her heart, they would have fled in dismay from the tempest of angry passions that racked it inwardly, leaving no trace upon her polished brow and guarded eye. To -them, her manner was only chil- lingly forbidding. Mr. Moore had been assisted into 2 the library, where he lay half buried amid the cushions of the crimson damask sofa, still unable to recline or sit; as he had hoped, but prostrate, with a feverish glow 'upon his cheek, and an unnatural brilliancy in-his eye. "Has Miss Rosebrough arrived," said he to the ser- vant in attendance. "I will go see," replied she, glad of an excuse to enter the brilliantly lighted and gay assemblage. "Stop a moment-tell her that I wish to see her in the library." Lillian was standing not far from her hostess when the message was delivered. She heard the names of Travers and Tricilli announced, as she glided noise- lessly away, followed by the eye of her hostess, glad to be rid of one whom she considered a powerful rival. But the message was gladly received by Lillian, for many considerations, because she felt that for some reason there was a want of congenialityibetween her- self and those by whom she was surrounded-because she knew that her -hostess disliked her-and while Eva was soon selected for the dance, she stood alone in si- 18   208        TLTTTTAN: OR, lent contemplation of the scene. And, too, she could see once, more the friend dearest on earth, her bene- factor and counselor--he who had defended her to the last from the petty annoyances of a vain, frivolous and jealous woman. As I have said before, she heard tLe summons gladly; her face kindled with a sudden en- thusiasm, and although she did not hear nor notice it, a murmur of admiration followed her through the crowded rooms. He did not hear the rustling of her dress, but was soon aware of her presence, although his face was turned to the wall as she entered the room. "Lillian!" and he extended his hand with expres- sions of the keenest delight. "You have been very sick, dear guardian!" there were tears in her eyes, as she searched his beloved countenance, worn and emaciated by suffering. "But I shall soon be well,' while his voice and coun- tenance-those indices of the world within-belied his words. "But I fear this noise, these lights, and this excite- ment will retard your convalescence." "Lillian, I have suffered this to see you once more." She could make no reply, her heart was too full; how she longed to tell him that it was not of her own free will that she had left him at that trying hour, but had actually been driven away from the friendly shel- ter of his roof. This then accounted for the invita- tion-it was through him. She had never before ap- peared so lovely to him as on that night, with the pure, transparent fabric of her robe floating gracefully about her. There was a comparison in his mind between his vain and ambitious wife and this artless, graceful, hum-   SHE BATTLE OF LIFE..     209 ble child of nature, invidious to the former. He drew from her gradually, a full account of her departure from his roof-her present useful, but cheerless situation. "Are you contented, Lily?" "It is my duty, dear guardian." She turned away her face, but could not conceal her agitation. "Are you happy?" "Perfect happiness is unattainable in this mortal state; but I am happy now." She smiled through, her tears-he understood her delicate compliment, and knew that it was genuine. "But what induced you to apply to Mrs. Floyd- the most irritable and unprincipled of women?" "I knew nothing of her character-was induced to apply there by seeing her advertisement in the daily." "And what is your salary?  "Twenty pounds, or one hundred dollars per year." Moore groaned aloud.  "Lillian," said he, solemnly, "I do not wish to de- tain you from the' gay crowd in the parlors and draw- ing-room. I have-little more to say to you."' "Do not send me back--I am so happy here!" "You must go back, Lillian, when I finish what there is to say. --Should you be happy to be placed above dependence? with your own capital, from  which to draw a guarantee for all expenses?" "Too happy! that can never be!"  She shook her head, sadly. "Never, is a darkf and solemn word, do not use it often, Lillian-notin that sense; but here is a valua- ble paper, which -I wish you to retain ini your posses- sion, unopened, until the day of my death, which I feel is not distant."   210        LILLIAN: OR, A fresh gush of music burst into the room, rung through the lofty ceiling-merry peals of laughter, and a rustling sound, like the whirl of the giddy dance. "Do not talk so despondingly, dear guardian;" she passed her hand over his pale and noble brow; " you will yet survive many long and useful years?' Go, Lillian, I would not. sadden you; but here you know we have no continuing city." There was another exciting burst of music from the ball room, the door was opened and a young man en- tered, strikingly noble and handsome, even in his un- assuming dress, which was extremely neglige; he bore the air of a poet or an artist. "This is the host," said he, " whom I have sought in every direction.' Are you ill,?" His surprise was evident, and his eager eye took in the scene at a glance. Lillian rose to depart. "Do not be in haste," said her guardian, detaining her with his hand. I Yes, I am ill;" he turned to his guest; "and have sought this retirement, not from inclination but neces- sity. Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Travers, the artist?" "That is my name, sir!" He needed not- to detain Lillian longer, she was riv- ited to the spot. A sudden light flashed upon her- here was the hero of her early dreams; a mutual flash of recognition lighted up the artist's features. They stood face to face. Mr. Moore broke the silence. "This is my adopted daughter, Miss Rosebroughj Mr. Travers. I have detained her too long already from her gay companions-but she insisted upon remaining and I could not banish so gentle and tender a nurse.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      2" Let me entreat you both to return to the dance. I shall soon fall asleep in the contemplation of your pleasure." It really appeared that the artist had a secondary motive to the ostensible-that of paying his devoir to the host; he was not surprised to see Lillian-as he had entered the'parlors Lillian was just leaving them--he had watched her retreating figure with a sudden thrill--she was not a stranger; this was not his first acquaintance with that lovely being. He had waited vainly for her return, and then went out to seek her. What sympathy had he with the light and frivo- lous throngs of worshipers at the shrine of mammon? possitively none -and his heart throbbed with a quick and restless yearning for one tender and earnest glance --one word, full of significant meaning--for congeniality which he had never found. And his sud- den emotion when meeting Lillian, was not that of sur- prise-it was something deeper. "I do. not wish,". said he, in a rich, earnest voice, "to destroy your pleasure, Mr. Moore, but if you will allow me; Miss Roseborugh has long denied us the pleasure of her-society. Let us return to the dance." "Go, Lillian, for ] am really in teed of sleep v The sealed paper which he had delivered into her- hand was placed in her bosom. She had no idea, but some curiosity-concerning its contents. She gave him her hand. "I will see you again, dear guardian, before long." As they opened the door to depart, they stood face to face with the hostess, who had missed her distin- guished guest, had mistrusted his position, and hastily came to seek him          --   212        LILLIAN: OR, "Ah," said she, with an assumption of gayety, " you are a truant; they are all awaiting your return!" "I came to seek a truant, madame!" Mrs. Moore's studious habits of concealment could not carry her through-nor lightning rival the fire of her glance--her smile was mockingly sarcastic; she drew near to Lillian, whispering'in her ear: "Let's have no more practiced arts at fascination.! Beware!" It was intended only for her, but it was overheard by him. Ah, he knew the woman who had uttered them; the vail that hid her soul was gauze. "Did you address me, madame?" said he, turning sharply to her. "I remarked, simply, that Miss Rosebrough might borrow color from the red rose in her hair. Is it to this interview," turning sharply to her husband, " that she owes her lack of color and vivacity?" "Lillian is always natural and original?" The arrow intended for another had returned into her own bosom. The demon was at work in her heart. "He is perfectly infatuated with the girl!" I do, not wonder!" was the calm reply. She ground her teeth noiselessly; she chafed against the bars 'like a caged tigress.: It was useless anger. Moore comprehended all--but was powerless to act. The reproachful glances shot at his wife, missed their mark; she was proof against anything tender or re- morseful. Some canaries, hanging in the room over the sofa upon which Moore lay prostrate, commenced fluttering about and chirping to each other, or to the couple who were leaving them. Mrs. Moore, forgetful of her other guests, followed these into the ball-room   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      21  A new set was forming on the floor; they placed them- selves opposite Eva and Tricilli, who were already waiting. Lillian could not cherish for an instant the unkind and cutting words she had heard; they did not apply to her-why should -she, in the sudden joy of her heart, harbor anything- which should detract from lier happiness? The dance was very short-but did not pass without its enlivening effect. He led her to the drawing room, to the very recess which, of all others, she would have sought. The moonlight still trembled there; now, there was not only one but seve- ral rays blending in a broad line of light, softening and religious. The breeze had not ceased -to lift the dra- pery, and scatter its incense from a thousand sleeping flowers through the embrasure. "This is a quiet little gem of a etreat," said he, " it is a valley among the hills-an island in the sea." He led her away to Italy-he showed her, in bright, unfading colors, the vivid scenery of that delightful country. There was a rustling among the vines be- neath the window. His quick ear detected the sound- his cheek changed slightly. "The breeze increases," said he. And with his wonderful powers of portraiture, he painted the tempest at sea. She was fascinated, catch- ing every word, like the breath of inspiration, they filled her soul. "And is Italy," said she, timidly, "more beautiful than our own country, or is it association which ele- vates and ennobles every scene?" "Italy- has some peculiarly beautiful scenery-we can draw. no comparison between, the two countries. Before I left this city," his earnest gaze was fixed upon   214        LILLIAN: OR, her, " there was a little Flower Girl, of whom I had learned something, and in whom I was particularly in- terested. Pardon me, Miss Rosebrough, and do not deem me rude, if I say that she resembles you. Her name was Lillian." A flood of bright crimson, flushed her neck and brow--he saw it-it was enough; she needed not then to borrow the hue of the damask rose in her hair. "How long," he continued, in a low voice, "have I remembered her--how perfectly--and her little me- mento of roses and geraniums are here also." He drew from his pocket a case of pearl, and touch- ing a secret spring, it flew open, revealing a few dried leaves, without form or fragrance. "' This was her token!" Her hand was carelessly toying with a concealed cord which hung about her neck-his quick glance de- tected it. "I would give my heart to know that she retains my parting token-and has treasured it, as I have hers! Can you enlighten me?" Her eyes had fallen beneath his earnest gaze--a deeper tint pervaded her cheek-but she looked up quickly and smiled. "My name is Lillian. One day, Mr. Travers, I car- ried some bouquets to the Church of the Messiah, they were to adorn a bride. I was very unhapy and mise- rable, for I had simply done my duty, and hoped for its reward, but an unkind word was like a dagger thrust, I shrank weeping into the shadow of a great pillar, weeping at an unjust accusation; there was one other there beside myself, a young man who appeared like me unhappy, perhaps it was my imagination which   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      215 colored everything, but he accompanied me -home, wo exchanged tokens, and-and--" "Where is the token?" said he, eagerly. She unbound the cord from her neck, to which was attached the hair ring. "The very same! I have not said enough--these were pledges of our early friendship-now, they are proofs of our constancy-what shall they be in the future?  Again there was another sudden rustling of the vines, and Lillian turning hastily thought she detected a pair of fierce black eyes flashing upon her from without. She could not tell whether it were so or not, but it silenced them for a few moments. The artist soon re- covered. "What shall they be in the future? Still pledges? Where is your father, Miss Rosebrough?", It was a fearful question at that time, coming so un- expectedly-it was a blow. ' He has gone away!" Travers perceived that he had touched a wound, and hastened to turn the subject. "This is not your home, Miss Rosebrough?"  "Oh, no ;" she hesitated a moment," I am simply  governess at Mrs. Floyd's." She had told the secret of her humble; position-- would he despise her? Better thus than deceive him. She had spoken the truth boldly, and yet there seamed some inconsistency in the circumstance-an adopted daughter of a proud and wealthyman, yet maintaining herself! She read it all in his ingenuous countenance. "I preferred being independent!  "But would you like to ride over to the cottage 19   216        LILLIAN: OR, once more? If so, I will call for your sister and your- self to-morrow, after your duties for the day are ended." "I am sure it would be pleasant-we have not seen the old cottage for a long time, since it passed into other hands!" The mention of her early home threw a momentary shadow over her happiness,. but it quickly passed away in the genial society of her new acquaintance. But this was destined soon to be snatched away from her- this new-found happiness! Her evil genius, Mrs. Moore, appeared, plausible and insinuating. "I am afraid, Lillian, you will be accused of mo- nopoly, having rejected several offers to dance already, this must not be, positively, any longer!" "I am at your service, madame," said Travers, feel- ing that there was some little justice in her reproof. "I would like to be introduced to Miss Rosebrough's sister!" "There are other ladies in the house, quite as charm- ing and beautiful as she." "Any or all, as you please! ' His tone of indiffer- ence was more galling than any sarcasm. "The Italian women must' be very beautiful, Mr. Travers?" said his companion, Mrs. Moore. s"Those of our own country are still more beautiful, madame!" She would have appropriated this compliment gladly, but even her vanity could find no balm for its wounds-- knowing well that he did not refer to her, or that she was not included in his flattering remark. "You have never seen my conservatory, Mr. Tra- vers-it is lighted. let us go in there! I have the   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      217 choicest collection of plants you have seen in this country!"He was completely caught in her toils, "I have," she continued, " an exquisite specimen of the night-blooming cereus; it may be new, even to you- it is now in bloom." Her manner could not deceive him, being fully pre- pared to act on the defensive. "The plant is seen in its full perfection in Italy. It is worth cultivation, but very frail and delicate." The odors of the sleeping flowers were almost suffo- cating-roses, geraniums, hydrangeas, and, as she had said, almost every species and- variety of plant, made the air heavy with their subtle incense. The conserv- atory had been lighted for the entertainment of the revelers, the large glass doors opening therein were. thrown back, but if it had received any attention from the frivolous assembly, it was at present deserted. "I have a very kind and indulgent husband, Mr. Travers, but it was the one great mistake of my life!" she sighed faintly. " To what do you refer, madame?" "To my foolish marriage!" 'You ought certainly to be contented and happy; everything in this mansion is subservient to your will, is placed here for your pleasure and enjoyment: it is but a poor reward for .your husband's generous libe- rality!" "But I am not happy-contented I might be-but there is no congeniality. There is such disparity, too, in our ages!" "Domestic infelicity ought, never to be the subject of comment. Your husband is very ill, but I have been   218       LTTTLTAN: OR, delighted this evening with his cordiality, he appears both amiable and affable." "Amiability is often assumed to hide deep defects." "Yes," he replied, meaningly, "we know very little of the heart from external appearance." Mrs. Moore bit her lips with vexation, but no other signs of emotion were allowed to be visible. "Mr. Travers, I was a vain and foolish girl when I married, but later experience has taught me many things-would I had known all then!" "Your meaning is obscure." "I did not know my heart." "It is somewhat late to have discovered the mistake." Your sex are so inconstant," said she, pettishy, 'you have forgotten our early--friendship!" The last word seemed substituted for some other, which she dared not utter-some word more expressive. "When one has taught us the first discipline of life, las directed us to fame and fortune, with a bitter iraught, eventually sweet, we ought certainly to bestow so small a favor in return as our friendship." The moon and stars shone brightly through the glass windows that inclosed the conservatory, palely on the trembling plants, some shooting upward, as if to pene- trate their prison walls, others bending gracefully, as of mourning their departed bloom. "Friendship is a cold, unmeaning word." "And yet friendship-true friendship--is an inesti- mable blessing." "And is very easily warmed into love!" He could misunderstand her no longer-he was weary with this foolish jesting. "Madame, it was you who taught me the lesson-not b.; He 1   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      219 I believe with any good intention--you wronged and deceived me; even if you were free, it would be im- possible for me to love you, but now criminal. Let us return to the drawing-rooms."   "Hear me," said she, "all this time I have loved you, and would flee from the odiousa psence of one who has never been a husband. It was a fatal mis- take-" "It is now irretrievable- and I am glad, madame! signally liberated as I was from a bondage which would have been oppressive. Your mistake/discovered mine!" Her cheek had changed to an ashen hue-shame, anger, mortification, revenge, changed her features to the look of a demon. "If you do not love me-if you will not hear me- beware that artful girl from whom you have just parted!" "Your caution is unnecessary." "Perhaps you are already involved." "Madame,' said he, sternly, "you drove me away from my home, purchased by years of toil and self denial; you wrung from my heart its life-blood with your cruel desertion. In a foreign land I had buried my grief, I had overcome it, I had forgotten it. Now, with my heart yearning-I will not deny the truth- yearning for sympathy and love, the wanderer has re. turned-but he can never quench his thirst at broken cisterns, at the troubled fountains of deceit and ma- lice. In short, I abjure that which is offered me- truth, gentleness, sincerity and earnestness are the requisites I seek." "Find them; if you can!" This mood was preferable to the tender regard which   220        LLILLAN: OR, she had evinced toward him. He offered her his arm once more, as a delicate intimation that he desired to close the interview, but she declined it rudely, and turning sharply on his heel he left her.. In the meantime, Lillian had been sitting alone; it was a quiet dream of happiness that invested her spirit i with delightful romance. Oh, it had been a long, weary reality; the golden visions of her youth had winged away their flight, far, far through the azure, disappearing to her-sorrowful gaze. She had beckoned them, she had called to them, eager to embrace their angelic forms, the place was vacant in her heart or sup- plied by cold and stern reality. There had been a faint hope surviving amid this wreck--a hope of one day meeting her father, even here on earth-of one day meeting him who had captivated her childish fancy- in whose sympathy she had revived from the pressure of sorrow. While these reflections passed rapidly through her mind, imparting their soft and delicate hue to her countenance, the drapery fluttered, and the same sound which before had attracted her attention caused her to turn and look toward the window-she could not be mistaken this time-a fair and delicate hand had parted the heavy folds of damask, and the same dark, menacing countenance flashed upon her, disap- pearing as before, suddenly. Usually calm and com- posed in exigency, Lillian was startled into a faint scream at the second appearance of this mysterious visage. Travers was approaching the spot at that in- stant, and several others were attracted by the scream. "Pray tell us the cause of your alarm, Miss Rose- brough," said the former. Aunt Betsey was among the number of her auditors.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      221 "Girls are always screaming at nothing," said she, reproachfully. "You will believe me, Mr. Travers, having been wit- ness to the same apparition, an earthly one, however," said she laughing; "it was the very face we saw be- fore, only more distinct and unmistakable." His cheek had become pallid as her own. "Yes-I could rely upon your statement, however, as readily had I not seen it. But let- us investigate this matter." Laughing and full of glee, a party of young girls declared they would follow him. Others stood by the window in the recess, assisting the search by their presence and with words of encouragement, lightly ut- tered. The moon had reached her zenith, pouring a flood of silent, silver glory over the sleeping earth, hushed and mysterious, peaceful as an infant slum- berer. A heavy vine of honeysuckle, so fragrant in the dew, had been trained over the window of the re- cess; it hung pendant, with its wealth of blossoms, with closed chalices, sealing up their dew drops. "Do not break that beautiful vine," said Lillian,.who was bending out of the window. "It is already broken," replied Travers, "proving your assertion good." But nothing was then to be seen of the intruder, and the party returned, full of merriment. "We must have some music to dispel the effect of this strange apparition!" Travers glanced at Miss Rosebrough-his embar- rassment did not escape her notice. "Let me lead you to the piano, it will relieve the monotony of the ceaseless dance."   222        LILLIAN: OR, Lillian could not refuse the request-she had never overcome her natural timidity-but a sense of duty and a willingness to oblige in some measure reassured her. Accepting his proffered arm, and accompanied by a crowd of listeners, among whom were her sister and the Italian, they proceeded to the drawing-room, whence the piano had been removed from the library, in favor of the invalid host. "Why do you not ask to be excused," said he, laugh- ing, " because you have a cold, or are not in practice?"9 "Because neither would be true; music is my great resource from the trials and annoyances incident to my position." "Is this your only resource?"The words were spoken so low that they scarcely reached her ear. "No, I have various others-reading, poetry, which embodies all the emotions of the soul--and chiefly spiritual refreshment, which all who seek obtain!" They had reached the piano-timidity was forgotten -he had led her mind instinctively away and prepared it for the final struggle. The Italian stood very near, watching every movement, apparently delighted, almost fascinated, by the grace and innocent beauty of Lillian, whom he beheld for the first time. In a corner of the room, dark and lowering, still wearing the smiling mask of habit, Mrs. Moore observed and listened, ap- parently in conversation with Aunt Betsey, but the musical performer had not noticed this group in the panorama. Her voice, which promised so much in childhood, had fulfilled all. It was clear and liquid, and silvery as the summer brook-it was plaintive and tender as the wind-harp-it-was wild and thrilling as the lark, low and tremulous, like the cooing dove. She   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      223 possessed the rich and singular faculty of losing her- self, and all her surroundings, in the sentiment and melody of her, song. Even Mrs. Moore was con- strained, unwillingly, to hold her peace, by the silence of her guests. Soon as she ceased, another song was called for, and another--it was no vain and foolish (con- ceit that actuated her to compliancej but an earnest love for the exquisite - expression of soul in song, ac- companied by a naturally yielding disposition. Aunt Betsey started fiercely from her concealment. "Are you not ashamed to monopolize the instrument, Miss Lillian," said she, scornfully. Lillian blushed a vivid crimson, and rising hastily, said: "Pardon me, if I have wearied and annoyed my friends; but I love music, forgetting that all do not!" "Young ladies like a conspicuous position." Still deeper grew the red upon the brow and neck of Lillian. "My motives have been misconstrued." "Many thanks to you, mademoiselle," said Tricilli, who had been an eager listener, " many thanks for your beautiful songs. I have not heard such music since I left Italy, and not often there!" He did not know nor care, perhaps, what bitterness his words infused into the ever jealous heart of Florenee Moore, and many others, who admired, but would not concede the palm. "'We will hot urge you further," said Travers, ' be assured we are gratified for this delightful entertain- ment." Mrs. Moore had drawn near, watching her opportu-   224        LIT TTAN: OR, nity, when she thought no one observed, she whispered, maliciously. "Drink in their flattery-they know you are silly enough to believe them." Lillian grew faint; there was nothing-not a move- ment nor a word that had escaped the apparently in- different guest, Hermann Travers. "Let us leave the crowd for an instant, Miss Rose- brough, the fresh air will revive you!" He drew her gently away, and the light breeze pass- ing over her brow, lifted the fallen ringlets of her hair, which she strove, vainly in her sudden pain, to re- fasten. "Parties of this kind are rarely agreeable," said her companion; "we see the light and trifling side of hu- man nature-but the heart! the heart is wanting. I have seen no evidence of any, save in one to night." She did not reply; contending emotions shook her soul; she was ready to weep, restrainiTng her tears by a great effort. "You preferred being independent," said he, repeat- ing her former words; "you were wise-this is not my first acquaintance with Mrs. Moore. Do not give her idle words a second thought." Still the struggle was going on in her soul; she had borne so much of late-she had toiled and suffered- she had been walking in darkness, and a ray of sun- light just shot across her path; now it was obsured by sudden clouds. "Oh, Lillian, here you are," said the merry voice of Eva, " you are very exclusive." She did not mean it unkindly, but it added a fresh sting to the other wound.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      225 "Mrs. Carroll is waiting for us to say good night. Dear sister, do not look so sadly--have you not recov- ered from that fright?" "Yes-let us go," said she. He caught her by the hand: "Remember your promise, to-morrow!"     CHAPTER XV. "I HAVE seen the gipsey again! she haunts me like a demon, the till thought of her has become an actual dread; she dogs my steps every where! Who is she? and what is her object?" Travers was pacing the floor of his room at the hotel, and had addressed himself to his friend, who was qui- etly enjoying a cigar. "Sit down, and take it calmly ;" and he puffed away the smoke in long and graceful wreaths. "You are in love, old fellow," said Travers, turning suddenly in his walk, and slapping him familiarly on his shoulder. "Come own up--acknowledge-make a clean heart of it." Still he puffed away, leisurely. "All have their weaknesses, my friend. Now, mine is the weed, and yours--the gipsey girl!" "You have no sympathy; I flattered myself you had, and for that reason invited you to accompany me on this tour. It is all right if I am deceived!" "What would you have me do?" "Talk-talk-say anything rather than nothing!" "It would amount to nothing. But, seriously, I can not help you; inform the police." "That is your sympathy. Do not say anything!" "One would think that you had been to an execu- tion, instead of a gay festival like that last night. I   THE- BATTLE -OF LIFE.     227 saw you going off with Mrs. Moore--positively desert- ing that beautiful young'creature to look at the plants in the conservatory. Your morals are degenerating!" Travers laughed in spite of his vexation, "She did not lay seige to you, then?", "Bah!" and he tossed the end of his cigar out of the open window. "It is strange that we ridicule to- day, that which yesterday we approved and admired. Mrs. Moore has ceased to charm! Did you say her husband is ill!" "I did--and'only wonder that he retains his reason. But to return to the original theme. That gipsey re- minds me of some one I 4iave seen before; the flash of her glance-the grace of her movemet-s-al se, Em like the image of a dream!"-  Tricilli remained'silent. "And she was with us on the ship?" "Yes--and ever present now." "You fled from the land of mystery--bearing mys- tery with you.! advise you to think no more about it. What pleasure is that you hold in reserve for us ." "A ride for the, ladies and ourselves "' "Mrs. Mooro and the gipsey, eh?' Perhaps more in consonance with your taste- but I have invited Miss Lillian and her sister." "How kind and thoughful you are. I will confine my attention exclusively to Miss Lillian!" "And I to her sister!" In spite of Tricilli's vivacious word, the agreement caused an instantaneous change of countena nce,. which did not escape the observation of his friend, who' com- menced to rally him upon the subjeci met            abet   228        LTLLTIAN: OR, "It is your own suggestion," said he, laughing, " and you must abide by it!" "-You will find me more powerful as a rival than you had supposed!" Lillian denied herself the necessary sleep upon the following morning. Mrs. Floyd, who had also been a guest at the fete, had not arisen when she commenced her duties for the day. Languid and miserable, she was poorly calculated to combat with the difficulties which met her at every step. Imperfect lessons, irri- table, disrespectful behavior, conduced to render her still more miserable. "Give me patience, or I can never endure!" was the cry of her heart. Longing to breathe the fresh air, which would have given her new life and vigor, but it could not be con- ceded her, and the day wore wearily away. Toward noon, somber clouds portended a storm, but they rolled away with a few peals of thunder and vivid flashes. Lilli-an sighed as she thought of the anticipated ride- but the bright sun shining on the sable mass soon dis- persed it, showing the bright blue of the summer sky. Mrs. Floyd did not make her toilette until after din- ner, when she came languidly into the recitation room, and seating herself by the window, courted the breeze, and criticized her governess' method of instruction. The pupils, emboldened by the presence of their advo- cate, seized the opportunity to oppress and annoy her. Any rebuke she well knew would bring down the un- just anger of the lady upon her devoted head. "You are totally unfitted, Miss Rosebrough, for your duties this day, by last night's dissipation, it is - clearly to be seen!"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      229 "I have performed them faithfully, nevertheless; my feelings, madame, are never consulted!" "Oh, no, it is unfortunate-governesses should be consulted-they should be made the criterion of the house!" For a moment Lillian was staggered-for a moment determined to throw up her situation, to throw off the yoke of bondage which galled and oppressed her--and the sense of her friendless and. forlorn condition suc- ceeded the temptation-would she be better off? was there a refuge on earth for her wounded and aching spirit? "Mrs. Floyd," said she, suddenly," have I not served you faithfully and conscientiously? What pleasure can you find in persecuting a friendless orphan? t  "Persecuting! Miss -Rosebrough; do you nof re- ceive an equivalent for your services? This comes of educating girls beyond their station, of flattering them foolishy and ministering to their conceit-in my opi- nion you forgot maiden modesty last night!" Lillian's eye flashed fire, but it softened immediately into a. mournful, reproachful glance. Had not others accused her of the same thing, and in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. But she could not see wherein the fault had been committed; but then we can not judge ourselves as others do, and she concluded it must be so; perhaps it was her sud- den joy which had emboldened her, and she quietly re- plied, PleaseW tell, in what did I appear so?" "In your bold acceptance of the attention proffered by a  young man, a stranger!" Lillian blushed deeply, as if she had been the guilty creature her words implied.   230        TT,TLLTAN : OR, "If my actions were inconsistent, my motives were pure!" 6 We can only judge of actions from their fruit- their correspondent results!" "Do not judge me too harshy, madame. I have ever striven to do my duty. I was induced to attend this party from a desire to see an old and tried friend; you could not blame me, if you knew all!" "I have no desire," she answered, haughtily, to " pry into the secrets of others!" and swept from the room, with a toss of her head. Lillian dropped the book which she held in her hand, and saying that she was unable to instruct them more that day, there was an instant rush to the door and a joyful shout of release, fr c.:hose who had longed to frolic in the glorious sun- lhitn^ After all was still, Lillian leaned her head wearily on her folded arms and wept-on looking up, conscious of the presence of another, she beheld Mrs. Floyd looking at her with a bitter smile. "If you are ill, as you have stated, you had better retire." She made no reply, but bowed and withdrew; but the promise had been made to Travers, and it should be fulfilled, despite the malice of her enemies, however in- consistent her conduct might appear to others. She was truly ill from fatigue and unkindess, to which she could never become accustomed. Before- her toilet was completed the carriage was at the door, and hastily ar- ranging her hair, she ran down, the stairs. At the foot of the stair-case, her tormentor awaited her. "Inconsistent girl," said she, with a sneer, "you are too ill to per-form your duty, but not so with pleasure!"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      231 "I have promised to go to my old home with my sis- ter, and can find no excuse to break the engagement.' "Truly, more serious than your regular duties!" "It shall be atoned to-morrow, madame!" Tears stood in her eyes as she passed along, but they were soon dispelled with the breath of -e fresh air, with the beauty of the sunset scene; it kindled her soul with enthusiasm, as a glbrious sunset ever does to one who can appreciate it. She did not heed their unfeigned admiration, her sorrow was forgotten, she was exhilarated by the exercise, and- by the pres- ence of kind and kindred spirits, which flushed her pale and languid cheek with a hue lovely as the sunset dye. "I have loved the sunset from childhood--  are traveling toward the golden gate, through Dv 46:a transient glory flashes over the earth and sky; I have somewhere read a poem, entitled the Portals of Para- dise. Far away, where the crimson glory lies; Where the earth embraces the bending skies, And they mingle their soft and varied dyes, Are the Portals of Paradise I I believe it is a fancy common to us all!" "Only to poetical temperaments! but pray tell us, Miss Rosebrough, how you embody so much soul in your singing?" "Can you tell me how the pencil transfixes the liv- ing object on the canvas-only wanting motion to em body life? It is an olden tradition, that every picture has a silent soul, transmitted to it from a dying saint; it is not hard to believe at times-in your painting of the Madonna, Mr. Travers, I have often recalled this fancy."         - 20   232        LTILTTAN: OR, They arrived soon at the mansion of Mrs. Carroll, where Eva gayly awaited them. 4You must pardon our dilatory appearance," said she, after the compliments of the day; "Aunt Betsey was delivering one of her moral lectures to my obtuse and undignified sister-they are so beneficial!" "Eva, how can you talk so!" but the gentlemen laughed, and inquired, who is Aunt Betsey? "A maiden aunt of Mrs. Carroll, who has a particu- lar aversion to-mankind in general, and young people in particular!" "How does it happen Miss Eva, that you were more fortunate in social relation than your sister?" '-ecause she sacrificed her own interest to mine- wai epa went away we were very unhappy, and had 'o friends-Lillian had known Mrs. Carroll before; sne is such a dear unselfish sister-that lady had offered her a home, which she declined for my benefit: for you must know, when we were very young, mamma died and left me in her care; she -has faithfully fulfilled her promise!  Lillian had been engaged in earnest conversation with the Italian; she had not heard her sister's expla, nation, which threw a flood of light upon their different positions in the world. There was no one present to mar their enjoyment, and it was not strange that two young, fresh spirits, untarnished by the world, should feel the exhilaration incident to such enjoyment. "Oh, there is the cottage, Lillian, see how it has gone to ruin!" There-was a sudden pause in the conversatiQn. f; So we all grow old and changed," said Travers; :' the human heart is like a dwelling--the scene of joy   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      283 and sorrow, of disappointment and fulfillment; it must be sustained by the strong pillar of hope, or sink into despair and ruin!"  "The garden is overrun with weeds. Ten years have passed since we stood by the gate, watching the retreating figure of our father. Oh, Mr. Travers, you do not know what we have suffered!" but Lillian stopped instantly, as she thought he could have no sympathy with their griefs and loneliness. "Is your father dead?" "We hope not--but we have not seen him since!" "You said he joined the army?" "He did--it was all contrary to my wishes, but I was a child-it was well; the future was hidden from -our view." "It would give you no pleasure to walk about in the old garden," said Travers, gently. "It is so sadly changed, it could give us no pleas- ure ;" she spoke in a low voice, as if in the presence of some loved and departed object. "I remember very little of my early boyhood," said Travers, thoughtfully; " later impressions have oblite- rated those of former years." "Let us banish melancholy," said Tricilli, " it is un- welcome to the young; perhaps we shall have a taste of the marvelous before we return ;" this was said with a glance at Travers, who understood its meaning, and colored slightly. "My Italian friend," related he, "has brought away the art of necromancy, from  his native land, which abounds with the marvelous. Beware his charms!" "Lillian is very susceptible; I must have a motherly care of her, or incur Aunt Betsey's everlasting anger!"   234        TTTTTAN: OR, During the ride, Travers sat next to Eva, devoting his undivided attention to the beautiful girl, whose life and gayety charmed and delighted him; instantly per- ceiving, however, that she lacked the deeper capacities of her sister; but he was satisfied for the present, de- termined never again after one fatal lesson- to risk his happiness upon an unstable foundation, without testing the firmness and solidity, whereon he would build. The last lingering ray of sunset had paled and died away, the deep blue was studded with innumerable stars-it was calm and peaceful, not a ripple stirred the stream, not a sound disturbed the quiet repose of the motionless landscape-if the foliage stirred, it was imperceptible. They rode for a little distance without speaking a word-their hearts full of the beauty of the hour and scene. There was a delightful drive along thre bank of the river. "Let us enjoy it while we can," said all. Even Lillian was willing to pay the penalty which she knew would result from the evening's pleasure, in angry looks and censorious remarks. "There is no time like the present: 'Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die!" "Do not quote the heathen philosophers," Mr. Tra- vers, "it is sadly out of place, in these enlightened times!" "Pardon me," Miss Rosebrough, 'it was -a foolish jest-bearing an absurdity on its very face embody- ing the immoral and darkened creed of those who ut- tered it?" "There are some," said Tricilli, "who would scorn to adopt such a creed; but who make it the code of life-rational creatures-living on the earth, with that {   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      285 heaven above, forever beckoning; conscience forever warning-revelation speaking vainly to them!" They could not have chosen a more picturesque or refreshing scene; the trees reflected in the placid wa- ter-every ray of light trembled on its bosom, with a silvery luster--another sky-other stars-another land- scape in the water. Occasionally, a wild bird started from its covert and skimmed over the mirror, as if to cool its restless wing. A small sail-boat, containing a gay party like themselves, moved lazily and impercep- tibly upon the river- there was scarcely breeze enough to swell the white sail. A chorus of voices chanting the evening hymn to the Virgin, was wafted to the shore amid the pervading silence. It struck a chord in their hearts which responded to that solemn and de- lightful harmony.  How closely are the joys and sor- rows of life intermingled! All trouble was forgotten. The load which had pressed so heavily upon the heart of Lillian, was lifted as if by the touch of magic. Nature is our mother, she is full of sympathy for our woes-- her radiant mirror reflects the sunshine of our hearts; she whispers consolation to the mourners, full of the promise of hope, and at last we lay our weary heads upon her bosom, and she cradles us to sleep. "I am sorry," said Lillian, "to make the first sug- gestion of returning. I shall remember this ride for a a long, long time." She had addressed herself to no one particularly, and Travers did not answer her with a glance-he was engrossed with Eva, "What matters it," said the latter, an -half hour or an hour's lecture! It will be one or the other."               236        TLT TANr: OR, "Your sister is incorrigible, Miss Rosebrough," said Tricilli, laughing. "It is my want of proper influence." "Is her temperament so much lighter than yours, or has she been more highly favored?" Lillian did not observe that Travers awaited her answer also. "Nature has given her an elasticity of spirit rarely found; they recover the pressure of sorrow. Perhaps she is more favored in her social position. But I am truly fearful that our friends will be anxious about us if we do not return at an early hour." "It is with regret that we accede to your request." They turned in the direction of home, scarcely touch- ing the earth, so swiftly were they whirled along. The clocks were striking ten as they entered the city pre- cincts. Lillian started, as she heard the sound, recall- ing to her mind that which she knew was inevitable on the morrow. "This is certainly not late," said the Italian; " this is the cool and delightful hour-why need we hasten?" "To-day I failed in the performance of my duties; to-morrow it must not be so!" "Is Mrs. Floyd, then, so very exacting," inquired Eva; " you have never told me this before!" "I have not told you so now!" "Lillian -ought to have been a lawyer. But as every day must have an end, so must every pleasure. Here we are, and I see my friend, Aunt Betsey, is watching for us, through the blinds. I must assume an amiabil- ity and politeness which are not natural to me." "We have shortened this drive," said Travers, smil- P^R   .   TIIE BATTLE OF LIFE.     237 ing and -bowing, as he lifted her from the carriage, with the hope of enjoying another soon. "Oh, yes, they can not blame us-we have been very observant of their wishes--scrupulously so!' Eva had proven the life and entertainment of the little company. Lillian had said less, but her enjoy- nlent perhaps was deeper and more abiding; the contrast to hereery-day life more vivid and apparent. Not a word or glance had been lost to the observation of Tra- vers, who silently regarded her; he had dearly learned caution, never forgetting his past'experience for a mo- ment.  We darenot invade the sanctuary of a maiden's heart--and such an one as Lillian's, whose soul was as pure and white as a lily. He had given her no pledge of his love-had never sought hers-but the fountain had been strred, and its depths reflected one image. The ride was the fittest recreation she could have chosen-the influence of its enJoyment did not pass awayfor many days-now she could endure taunting words and looks. She did not imagine that Mrs. Floyd was jealous of her growing popularity-she could not  unravel the mystery that shrouded her unhappy fate, nor tell why she was everywhere selected as the victimv of capri- ious and wayward and malicious tempers; it was sim- ply this, though she did not understand it in the sim- plicity of her heart, because she was above them and beyond. The worldly love their own, but shewas not of them. M  any times she presented herself at the door of Mr. Moore'  s residence to inquire after the invalid's health, but one day the porter, having received instruc- tions to that, effect, shut the -door upon her, without receiving any reply. In her walks, many times, Lillian encountered the strange looking gipsey, often following   2388        TT,TTAN: OR, her, and disappearing suddenly from her view-she re- cognized those fierce black eyes, the flash of the diamond ring upon her snow-white hand. She passed Lillian quickly, turning to gaze at her directly in the face- tracing every line, scanning every feature-striving, as it were, to read her soul. "Surely I have never seen this being before that night; why does she pursue me, as if I stood between her and happiness? Have I strength to bear the bur- den 'assigned me-the way is dark and rough and weary, but others have trodden it before, and if I sink and can not rise, I shall rest in peace; that I have not known since my mother's death! ' The-next fete was to be given by Mrs. Floyd, who in- timated to Lillian that her position there was as a gover- ness, not an equal; that if Mr. Moore chose to invite her to his house, that was his taste, it was no precedent to her, Lillian received the intelligence meekly, and as a matter of course to be expected, willing to lend a ready hand to assist any preparation necessary to the enter- tainment. Mrs. Floyd had neither the taste nor judg- ment of the simple flower girl, to whom refinement was natural, the former having been elevated to her present position by a successful speculation on the part of her husBand. Possessing neither sensibility nor delicacy, or with either- she would never have consulted one to whom she had been unfeeling and cruel, she desired her to lay aside her regular duties for the day, and take the superintendence of affairs. Lillian had never seen Travers since the ride; aware that he was among the number of invited guests, as was her sister, a shadow of regret, a pang shot through her heart, at the rude- ness and ill-will of one whom she had striven faithfully   THE BATTLE' OF LIFE.      239 to serve, and to whom she could not refrain from feeI- ing superior, notwithstanding the difference in their position. Under her supervision, and with the aid of abundant means, the drawing-rooms and parlors were, decorated in the most tasteful and elaborate style, and the entertainment unrivaled. Wearied and flushed with the fatigue and excitement of the day, the flower girl seated herself in a retired nook, in a little arbor, over- hung with grape vines. There she was shut in from the Wnorld-there was nothing to wound her sensitive and bleeding spirit--the sounds of gayety could not reach her, nor the voice of merriment-she was natu- rally not melancholy, but hopeful, but everything con- duced to depress and sadden her. The day following the party given at her guardian's she had received a letter, a closely written letter, from her former suitor, stating that he had not withdrawn his attentions, having seen her on that evening, and vainly sought to obtain an interview, he had chosen this manner of addressing her as the most eligible, hoping that she would think more favorably of his pro- posal, before it was' too late; that his love was genuine, uninfluenced by  any grosser considerations, as was apparent. The letter was spread out before her, there were traces of tears upon her cheek, irresolution in her eye.  She re-perused it-no  more sorrow-no more labor--no more ill usage, but love, rank, influence, wealth, were offered her; a place in this-proud city equal to the proudest--the scene of her constant tribu- lation and misery. It was a powerful temptation-her brow throbbed, her heart ached, in a moment she had yielded, casting care, remorse, present and future sor- row to the winds!  She looked for a moment into her 21   240       LJ,4T TAN: OR, heart, and the picture terrified her. Searching in vain for one word of approbation, for any plea that would cover the perjury she was about to commit. Whom did she see in her heart? Ah, one who had no right there- why did she retain his memento? her hand was upon the cord which secured it-in the sudden pain and tu- mult of her emotions she tore it from her neck, and flung it on the ground. "I can not-I can not! God is my witness, I can not commit this evil-what! per- jure my soul? what! shall I throw away the struggle and toil of years?" The temptation was over! The ring was clasped tightly in one hand, the letter in the other. A wild bird startled from his slumber by her presence, fluttered and warbled in the moonlight, amid the green drapery of the graceful vines. "Why, Lillian, what are you doing here? Mr. Tra- vers and I have sought you everywhere." She started to her feet and would have fled, but could not-sinking back into the shadow of the arbor, she made no reply; she did not look up-she would avoid him of all others-and yet his presence caused a revul- sion of feeling-he had thought of her, had cared for her society. She had been unconscious of the arrival of the guests, of the lateness of the hour. "Why, sister, what has happened? how you look! why do you not come into the house? But Travers, perceiving her agitation, endeavored to 'conceal his knowledge of the fact, with the tact of one who is schooled in the mysteries of the human heart, said "Miss Rosebrough has been acting upon our fears-she is something of a coquette."  "I did not know that you would care for my pres- ence-that you would miss me even!"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      241 "But, Lillian, Mrs. Floyd will be offended!" "Mrs. Floyd has informed me of my position as governess, and my duty to my superiors!" Travers gave a sudden angry start, his brows were dark, his countenance severe, but he suppressed it. How cruel! how unkind! when you have done all." "Perhaps she is right!" "You do not think so, Miss Lillian, speak the lan- guage of your heart-she has been selfish, unjust and unfeeling."  "Oh, it is so the wide world over." "Your experience, in accordance with your words, has been sad." "I am sure she will be sad no longer, and if you choose to remain and comfort her for a little, I will return to the ball-room." She whispered in her sister's ear, "Keep up good courage, we may be happy yet!" Lillian shook her head. "Do not let me detain you, Mr. Travers, I shall be better soon." "Will you let me stay?" She could not reply; she dared not trust her falter- ing voice. Eva leftthem. "Is that paper which you hold in your hand the cause of your unhappiness? ' "No--yes-Mr. Travers, let me think a moment- partly so and partly not." "Surely, I have no right to ask."g "Do not misunderstand me. I did not mean to re- prove you, but I would burden no one with my secret sorrows!" This was said in a tone of the deepest dejection. "But if one wished to change your sorrow into joy, .        *   242        T IJTLIAN: OR, and had the power of doing so, would you deny him the privilege?" "To some, I would most assuredly." "But is there no one, Miss Lillian, in whom you confide? Have you never found a heart congenial with your own?"  It was testing her too severely, and she could not frame a reply. "s Perhaps I am peculiar--certainly isolated!" Is not the fault within yourself? you attract, and at the same time repel." "Of what would you accuse me?" "Your manner is so changeable. At times I could deem you really cared for me, and again that my pres- ence was odious!" "I have always been misunderstood!" There was one wh6 did not misunderstand her, who knew her heart better than herself. "I have been a great traveler, Miss Lillian, have sought happiness through the wide world, and know that it is not external, but within ourselves!" "And, of course, you have found it?" "A wrong inference-have fouil' where it abides-- there is one yearning still unsatisfied-combining the deepest need of my soul!" "The soul has only the one need!" "And what is that?" U The need of a firm, holy and religious hope!" "And that hope is comprehended in one word-- Love!' a Love is the essence of all things spiritual-of Di- vinity itself!" "And earthly love is but a shadow of the heavenly!"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       243 They were silent-the fluttering of the lonely night bird, and the beating of their hearts were the only sounds. "Mr. Travers," said Lillian, abruptly, "you remem- ber my fright that evening of the party?" "Oh, yes!" he changed color, slightly. "If I am   not very much mistaken that same face haunts me in my lonely walks.    A pair of flashing black eyes, a malicious smile, a penetrating glance are its principal features." Travers started, as if with a blow. "Then you have seen the figure, also." Yes, repeatedly--but it disappears into some by way, after following until my patience is exhausted." "Have you any key to the mystery?" "None whatever-I do not know what to think upon the  subject-in what light to treat it-ridiculous or serious." "It seems both to me." "Contraries are always found in extreme characters." It would only increase the mystery were he to relate all that he knew concerning the singular appearance which had followed them from Italy. Many times he had determined to accost her, but she fled from him instantly, perceiving his design; so that he was no nearer the truth than at first. "I will endeavor to ferret out this matter; but can not arrive at any definite mode of action." "Perhaps   some fortunate circumstance may yet throw light upon the mystery." Travers remained thoughtful for some moments. "Miss Lillian do you love and  believe in the mar- velous?"        . %     '      *  *,   244        LLILAN: OR, "Surely 'there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy ;' but I can only accede to those things which are real.

The world is young and fresh and blooming; but soon grows old and wearisome; and unless we cherish it-our love of the beautiful declines-we fail to note the dawn and evening-the change of seasons. It is the world within which occupies us." The sound of voices reached them, and Lillian trem- bling with affright lest she should be discovered, shrunk still more closely into the shadow. "If you desire it, I will go forward and prevent them from intruding into your retreat." "Thank you-thank you!" "Oh, here you are," exclaimed several merry voices, 4gathering inspiration as you would flowers from the garden? Poets and artists are always singular." c(Speculating upon the moon,fhaud her attendant sa- tellites?" Lillian drew a sigh of relief as she heard their re- treating footsteps. She was confident, however, that some one of the party had not accompanied them, but -was approaching the arbor; her apprehensions were quieted upon discovering that the intruder was only Eva, who drew near and sat down beside her. "Lillian, you are very unhappy!" "I am sorry Eva that you have discovered me this evening, and the secret of my unhappy position." "It is just like you to conceal it from your best   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      245 friend; the only one to whom you are bound by the ties of relationship; the only one who could sympa- thize with you.

"But you do wrong to conceal them from me. I would leave that insipid, heartless Mrs. Floyd; let her find a governess of her own stamp!" "Where should I go?"This was spoken with the calmness of despair. "Any one who desires a governess, and knows your worth, would gladly avail themselves of such valuable services. Sometimes I feel very hard toward papa for his unnatural desertion." "Hush, sister, hush! we do not know what he has suffered; he was a kind, good, and indulgent father; it was not like him! no, not like him!" "Sister, I can not keep a secret from you!"Lillian started and changed color, but answered calmly. "Is it anything ., Eva?" "You will call me a silly child!'"Her transparent cheek reflected the hue of her thoughts. "But you are so young, darling, only fifteen!" "Yes-'she answered quickly-too young to govern my heart-he is so noble." She did not know what a  pang her words inflicted. Calm, but white as the moonlight shining through the grapevine, she looked at her sister, and read it all- suppressing the groan that would have parted her white lips, she simply answered: "I can not blame you."   246        L;TLLTAN: OR, "JI knew you would not. But, Lillian, I dare not dream, and yet I can not help it; if I should have a home of my own, you should share it with me.

Lillian shook her head mournfully. o You would then have some one else to love," "Am I incapable of loving but one? must that tie absorb all others." "It will-it does!" "Then I will never contract it!" "You are a dear, loving sister!" "You have done so much for me-it is to you that I owe everything! Nobly have you fulfilled your prom- ise!" Deeper and deeper grew the shadow upon Lillian's heart and life. That promise! She must never come between its object and happiness-she must bury her timid hope forever and forever; and again the proffered love which she had rejected arose to tempt her to ac- ceptation-it might be the onlyc4ance of freedom- of rest from the galling bondage' t the yoke of servi- tude; lifted above it, no more petty calculation, no more fear of taunting and malicious words.

"Mrs. Carroll is so kind; she never has spoken one harsh or cruel word, and I do not care for Aunt Bet- sey, who never did love me; she torments herself more than she does me." Her silvery laughter startled the birds from slumber, and stirred the vine leaves and the evening echoes. - "Go back, Eva-they will come in pursuit of you; that gay party of young girls and I shall be discov- ered!" "Do not imagine that your fate is fixed as governess. You can be irresistible if you choose." A   faint smile parted her lips, but left no trace of joy or pleasure upon her countenance, and bidding her good night, Eva returned to the halls of feasting. "I might have known it! yes, I  might have known by beautiful young sister would not escape the eye of an artist! he can not fail to reciprocate her tender sen- timent. Yes, I  might have known it!

Here and there all was silent. The withered garlands drooped low from the exquisite drapery- faded bouquets lay scattered around-the lights were extinguished, or burned low in their sockets-the rev- elers had departed-every echo of merriment had died away, and night and silence, dark and heavy, settlec down upon the halls, which late had rung with laughter and the sound of flying feet! Stealing noiselessly to her room-morning broke upon her sleepless vigils; the only true and noble heart that beat beneath that roof was the victim of scathing sorrow and heart- searching anguish. She had firmly resolved, however, not to be influ- enced by her present unhappy state of feeling; to reply coolly but kindly to the persistent lover--giving him no hope. She could not be false to herself and there- fore could never be false to him, by uttering that which was untrue; he had offered her every valuable gift, and she had nothing to return-her love was all she could hope to bestow on any, and that was not hers to give.   THE BATTLE OF IEE. L49 CHAPTER XVI. EXCITEMENT, as the physician had feared, proved too much for Mr. Moore, for the delicate and irritable state of his -nerves. Upon the day succeeding the fete, he was totally incapable of the slightest exertion; the flush had faded from his emaciated cheek, showing its death-like palor. All day lying still and rigid as a statue--there was no sign nor expression of the world within, which, though silent, hoped and dreamed and feared and loved as ever. The echo of a sweet and} soothing voice still rung within its halls; there was one form flitting there, clothed in the moonlight as with a  halo-the better spirit of his blighted life! Of this boon he could not be deprived. Travers did not forget his invalid host. Understand- ing at a glance the sad condition of things-though mas- ter of that splendid mansion-he was still a cipher there. Were his wishes ever consulted? his comfort? save by the mercenaries who did his bidding-but a wonderful change appeared to have passed over his frivolous wife. Every afternoon, with a studied and becoming toilette, she entered the room and seated herself beside his couch; but there was another there! for which, or whom was this duty performed? The artist, with a tender pity, which would have become a more effemi- nate nature than his owe, visited him regularly. When he could endure reading, some favorite poem was pro- duced and canvassed. The sweet and thrilling meas- tures of Tennyson, or the deeper and more brilliant and I .   250        LILLIAN: OR, exciting scenes of Shakspeare. Sometimes history yielded up its treasures to their edification, or the soothing melodies of the holy Psalmist. Mrs. Moore endured, but could not appreciate, the exquisite senti- ments of the one nor the life pictures of the other. A mind totally given up to the world and its gayeties, must live in that world-it can never, with the wings of the morning, soar away, it is fettered. It was rarely she left them alone; and then the invalid seized the opportunity of recalling Lillian to his guest. In a low, and faltering voice, he spoke tenderly of her gentle- ness-her simplicity-her pure and exquisite taste- her mental and moral worth. "She has been all the world to me; through her the radiance of the unseen life has melted the icy barriers of my soul; in her love and sympathy I have been greatly blessed!" "But why does she not stay with you now and min- ister to your comfort? it is like ingratitude-this de- sertion!" "Oh, you do not know," said he eagerly, "Lillian, nor the circumstances to which she has succumbed. She would gladly come, but it can not be." "Do not think me intrusive, Mr. Moore, family se- crets can not be understood by a stranger." "Do not blame Lillian-never a shadow of suspicion should rest upon her lovely and unblemished character. She is all, and more than she appears to be--not will she always occupy her present lonely position-al- though to her the future holds some blessings unre- vealed." He scarcely spoke above a whisper, and paused for e   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.     251 breath-his listener, bending low over the couch to catch every sound, that he might not lose a word. "She has already rejected one, who could have placed her far above present or future privation--equal or superior to the richest and proudest; but Lillian could not tell an untruth-she could not sacrifice the priceless gifts of soul to the god of this world. She can not bow to him, nor do his bidding!" Moore closed his eyes, exhausted by his effort of speaking, and Travers re-arranging the pillows, ad- vised his friend to remain silent, and recover, if possi- ble from his exhaustion. The mind of the latter, in that interval of uninterrupted quiet, ran rapidly over the past-the scene in the arbor-the letter! He had now obtained a clue to the mystery of her grief; it must have been a temptation-for he well knew that the fiery furnace was scathing her soul. But gold is refined in burning, refined from dross. It was well-- he, too, had suffered, and the result was apparent. Suddenly unclosing his eyes, the invalid made an effort to rise, but failed. Travers sprang forward and took his hand; he beckoned him to come nearer--to bend over him-and his voice was low and broken, though he endeavored to speak louder and more distinctly Will you bring her here to-morrow evening?" "I will assuredly-if it be possible!" "Life is ebbing slowly out;" he placed his hand upon his heart; " this incessant throbbing-this deeply seated pain-never-never, will it leave me!" The face of Travers showed the deepest agitation. "You are fatigued, exhausted quiet is the best panacea."-   252        LTLLTAN: OR, -He took no notice of this remark, but answered eagerly. "She will come, she will come! I must see her!" "Be calm now, or you will be unfitted for any further exertion [" "Life is ebbing surely-slowly-out!' He relapsed into silence, and something like a swoon; the restoratives were within reach and speedily applied; but it was long before they infused any vitality. Tra- vers noticed that a change had passed over his counte- nance, but it had been so sudden that he could not re- alize it. Was it the touch of the invisible angel-the linking of this life to the unseen life-the sound of fall- ing fetters-exchange of bondage for freedom-earth for heaven? He would ring for Mrs. Moore--his hand was upon the bell, but the invalid checked him with a look, and he sat down silently, regarding the objects before him and around him-all the appliances of wealth and refinement were scattered through the apart- ment-the long mirrors reflecting the sad and luxuri- ous scene-surroundings, befitting a monarch. Could wealth purchase friendship-immunity from suffering and death? It seemed not! Mrs. Moore did not re- turn for a long time, having made some change in her evening toilette. She was unusually vivacious and com- municative. "You are a patient and experienced nurse, Mr. Tra- vers-a sick room is so gloomy and disagreeable-it is wearying and unsocial!" Travers looked at her in mingled pity and scorn. A woman, yet devoid of womanly instincts and feelings, he could not comprehend it; but her kindly natural instincts, had she possessed any, were warped and dis   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      253 figured by worldly influence and interests. iHe pointed silently and expressively to the face of the sleeping in. valid. "Ah, yes, he is asleep-I will not disturb him-this long and wearing sickness has changed him fearfully." Madame, it is something more!" "You are too easily affected-too sympathetic; paralysis is a slow and lingering disease!" You do not understand," said he with a sigh, " per- haps it will soon be over"  The solemnity of his tone and look communicated itself to her frivolous manner, if it did not penetrate her heart.         if it did not  "Let me send for the physician." He started suddenly from his sleep, exclaiming: "No, no! let me rest-no more drugs-no more pain and no more sorrow p" "Better do as he bids you," said Travers, in a low voice. The hours had glided into midnight--the lamp burned dimly--silence pervaded the room. "You can retire, madame, I  will keep vigils here!" "Thank you-thank    you-I am very weary; so many nights of watching and anxiety have outdone me ." Travers smiled at her falsehood, for he well knew it was the idle and dissipated life she had beenleadin ; neither care nor anxiety which preyed upon her spirit; but she withdrew, saying: "Good night- you are so kind--call me if needed !" And he was left alone with the sleepinginvalid, the nurse having been dismissed during his convalesence . Two or three times before morning the slumberer breathed  heavily, and exclaimed in a whisper:   254        LILLIAN : OR, "It is my heart, it is my heart!" "What of your heart?" "Breaking!" Florence did not make her appearance in the morn- ing till the sun was high in the heavens. "Go out and breathe the fresh air, Mr. Travers; you look haggard and worn." He availed himself gladly of the privilege, for many painful thoughts, rather than watching, overshadowed his countenance/. He did not remain long away; there was no mistaking the symptoms he had witnessed in the invalid; certainly he could not survive long; and returning, waited patiently to execute the mission which had been delivered to him. There was no ap- parent change throughout the day. Motionless, al- most lifeless, except an occasional quivering of the eyelids, and momentary convulsion of the features. "Has the sun set?" These were the only words he had uttered that day. ' Yes-and the moon has risen." "Is she coming? ' "I will go directly and bring her here!" He made a gesture of assent. It was but a few mo- ments before the door of Mr. Floyd's mansion admit- ted the messenger. "Tell Miss Rosebrough that I am in haste-tell her to come immediately." Lillian was not long in obeying the summons. "Miss Rosebrough-dear Lillian-your guardian, Mr. Moore, desires to see you!" She did not notice the manner of his words, only the matter. It flashed suddenly upon her, he was ill-he was dying. $   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      255, "Oh, he is dying, Mr. Travers, say that he is not- that it is not the occasion of this visit?" "I did not say he is dying-but he is veryill, and is impatient to see you!' ' I will go." She rose, but a violent trembling seized her, so that she sat down again to recover strength. "It seems as if he were so far away, I can never reach him!" Travers did not utter his thoughts-that the subject of their conversation was going far away-still far away.  "Can you lean on my strong arm?' "No, no," said she, shuddering, "I must bear the burden alone! and yet not alone for One is with me!" "You reject my proffered aid--you scorn my sym- pathy, as if I had done you some harm! why is it, Lillian?" They emerged into the moonlight-a silver flood resting on every living thing--on tree and stream-on the habitations of the rich and poor--on the human face, investing all with its pure, white and mysterious glory. "Let me share your griefs, dear Lillian!" A  sudden joy seemed to flash through the darkness of her afflictions-succeeded by a deeper gloom. "G You do not hear me," he persisted, " do not hear my pleading; you are deaf to my love-to the voice of my earnest entreaty." He stopped and gazed into her face; now she was strong and cold -still, but anguished. "It can not be-no, no, it must not be!" When he spoke again, his voice was changed--it was low and passionless. 22    256        LILLIAN: OR, "I have read you wrong. I had imagined foolishy that you responded to my sentiment. I have come home from a foreign land, Lillian, my heart yearning, yearning for tender sympathy and love. To that foreign land I had borne one little, charming image -one tender memento of a pure and guileless heart-is this my reward? Shall they fade with the faded memento? That image has become the living spirit of my tossed and troubled existence; it is she alone can speak the tempest calm--can bid the' sunshine penetrate my heart, and pervade my life. Say at least that you love me! With your love I am strong-without it, I am nothing." She could not, dared not say that she loved him- neither deny it. "Your silence is ominous-it is not the silence of assent! Oh, Lillian-dear Lillian-I had not known before how deeply this love is entwined with my being! And yet the secret of my past life is unrevealed. I would' not keep it from you, though you might despise me, there shall be no deception. I was about to wed this Florence Moore-it was she of whom and to whom I cried in the temple! it was she who taught me life's severe and searching discipline, wronged and deceived me; but, contrary to my expectations, it has proven the greatest blessing of my life, though in a dark and unseemly disguise. I did not then acknowledge it as such-it has made me all I am! It seems to me now, in the remote past, a false star, a meteor. I was attracted by her beauty-too young and honest myself to judge this of others, I thought her pure and true, and innocent as beautiful-but it was a dream, a vain and foolish dream; this lo-re is so different, it is ieep,   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      257- it must be abiding. Do not scorn the treasures of my soul-speak, dearest, tell me what I would know!  "I can not deny the truth, and dare not acknowl- edge it. Mr. Travers there is an impassable barrier, not to our friendship, but to any deeper sentiment!" "A barrier? tell me at least what it is! You ac- knowledge that you love me! already are our souls united; what shall separate us? mine, now and for- ever  "Do not urge me more, my mind is tortured! It can not be! it can not be!" "I did not dream that you could be so hard and cruel; so unkind and distant, Lillian; shall I ever un- derstand you?" ( Do not try--do not try--better we should part and forever." At that moment their faces were obscured-the moon had entered a cloud, and the darkness was more intense from the former brilliancy. "So shall my life forever wear a cloud." "And mine-and mine-but Eva? There was a volume in that word-as it were the mystery revealed itself to his searching glance-but not perfectly. That she was some way connected with Lillian's thoughts and feelings, with her rejection of his suit, was evident. The moon re-appeared. The barrier was not impassable-he would remove it--he would remove mountains to attain this most desirable object of his life! the fulfillment of his dream. There conversation was not resumed, as the mansion of Mr. Moore appeared before them, and there was no further opportunity of saying more.   258        LILLIAN: OR, "But patience! patience?" he whispered to himself, "the blessing in disguise!" "Lillian has come," said Mr. Moore, whose ear, pain- fully quickened to every sound, detected her approach- ing footsteps. "Still perverse, still infatuated!" exclaimed Mrs. Moore, who sat beside him, awaiting the return of Tra- vers. C"Why should you wish to see one who has caused us so much unhappiness?" -"She has been for years the chief-nay, the only source of happiness to a poor, neglected old man!" "If you have not beeni happy, it arises from your- self." "Partially so ;" his strength seemed returning-he sat upright, with the appearance of renewed vigor and animation; "partially so, and partially to circum- stances. "You must be very obtuse not to appreciate my efforts." "Oh, Florence! She does not know, she can not tell, what is about to happen," said he, apologetically. Travers and Lillian entered the room-the former in advance, as if to prepare the way for her coming. "My dear guardian, you are so much better!" said she, in a tone of glad surprise. Travers turned away, as if from the reality-he knew otherwise. "I am glad you have come, my child- but you must not flatter yourself that I am better. You have seen the setting sun, brilliant, radiant, triumphant in his de- parting splendor-but it is fading glory, it is fading glory! The autumn is more intensely bright than   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      259 summer-it is evanescent brightness, and man resem- bles both." "But you are better--I know it-it is visible in your countenance and manner." "Do not delude yourself; but let us be unite] an 1 happy while we can." Mrs. Moore made many gestures of impatience--but they were unnoticed by the little group in the room. "How old are you, Lillian?" "I am now twenty, dear guardian." Her voice was soft and tender as the rippling wave, when she ad- dressed him.   He put his hand to his brow. "It is ten years since you came to live with us?" "Yes-ten. You were very kind to a poor, friend- less wandering orphan!" She did not weep; her voice was calm, but expres- sive. He addressed himself to Travers. "Be patient-I can not speak rapidly-let me tell you-did you ever love? Ah, yes, you do-well, so I once loved. I entered the bark that was to waft me over the summer sea, with one who had been like an angel to my dreams-and to whom was entrusted the priceless casket of my happiness-that casket which contained an invaluable gem." Mrs. Moore interrupted him, angrily. "Every one has read that portion of your history." "Not that which follows: She did not love me. I would have given my life for a tender word-for a glance-for a responsive sigh! She feasted on the admiration and adulation of the world-which was shut into her heart-and I, excluded!" He paused, and Florence remarked, bitterly:   260        LILLIAN: OR, "Sickness must have turned your brain, Mr. Moore!" "Would that it were. not real-that I were idealiz- ing. I tell you this, for you are both young, and you may learn from this, without experience. Oh, it is a bitter thing to love and be unloved-it is cruel-it is maddening. I awakened from my dream on board the ship, when we had taken passage on our tour. We traveled through delightful climes, and foreign, classic scenes; but they were cold, they were devoid of inter- est; the one great charm was wanting. After a long sojourn in distant lands, we returned. I surrounded my bride with all the appliances of refinement and lux- ury-but the charm was wanting still." Mrs. Moore turned and left the apartment. "One can not be kind to you, with all their good re- solutions-you are so stern and censorious." "My poor wife, she does not know what concerns her interest-it will all be changed when I am gone. I forgive her--but she has blighted my life. There came to our home a little girl-a frail, delicate blossom, torn from the parent Stem, deprived of nourishment- of the soul's food and light and raiment--hungry, thirsting, like myself, for sympathy and love. A good angel whispered me to speak kindly to her--to take her home and cherish her as my child." Lillian was sobbing. "You did! you did!" Travers whispered her to compose herself-this ex- citement was too much. She recovered her self-posses sion instantly. "When I was weary, it was she who soothed and comforted me, with her sweet words and simple ways and child-like faith.- When I saw how beautiful and   THE BATTLE OF LIPE.      261 gentle this faith appeared, and knew its reality, shown in her heart and life--I wooed it to myself, and for the first time, during my late troubled life, a sweet peace filled my soul, like the spring light, which clothes the trees and bowers and hills in soft and placid beauty. Through her teachings I learned this faith." "Oh, dear guardian, it was not I, it was another who taught it you!" "I learned this faith-it sa re--it is around me, there is nothing can bid it departt-through the clouds- through the darkness--through the valley it is leading me--leading me home! I was very jealous of my beautiful, accomplished and heartless wife; and I em- ployed a woman to come to my house and watch her proceedings-but, thank God, I believe she was only false at heart! You remember, Lillian, the mystery is revealed-it is this woman, whom you saw at night,- gliding about like a shadow, and therefore your refer- ence to it made me uneasy, perhaps, angry; but I was never angry again at little Lillian-it was her inno- cence that betrayed me. She has rewarded me for all, more than all!  But the jealousy and hatred and un- kindness of my wife, drove her away from me. I say this, not in accusation, but to exculpate Lillian from any blame which might fall upon her innocent head when I am gone. Travers I have read your secret-- know that you love her; she is a jewel, she is worthy, and I believe that you would cherish her as your own soul!" Lillian was trembling like an aspen -his arm encir- cled her, but she did- not push it rudely away-she leaned upon him for support,   262        LILLIAN: OR, "You will find that she is not pennyless. The paper, Lillian, the paper! have you preserved it?" "It is sacred to me as your gift, whatever it might be; though its contents are still a mystery." "It is the wealth of her soul I seek," said Travers; "Iove is but the union of spirits, and ours are conge- nial." "You can not deny him, Lillian!" "Do not talk so any more-you will break my heart!" "I shall rest in peace, when all things are arranged. Where is Florence? I will not say anything more to pain her. Bid her come back!" When she re-appeared, all traces of her anger had vanished, and she was weeping. "I did wrong to weary you; do not think unkindly of one who never harmed you by word or thought; let us forgive, and sometimes remember our life and parting-my love and death." Lillian uttered a low cry of pain--it was forcing the truth-the bitter truth upon her mind-that she could not see, or rather, that she would not! "I never meant to wrong you," said Florence, in a soft and unnatural tone. "But I have wearied my gay and thoughtless wife, wearied her with my distaste for pleasure; but, Flor- ence, be assured there is something better and purer and holier than worldly pleasure-it is Peace!" "It will not harbor in my bosom," answered his; wife, "never, never!" "Seek it-woo it-never has it been denied to any,"9 She was deeply moved, as he had never before seen her-as she had never been.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      263 "Dear Florence, it seems as if life were just open- ing, and it is closing. Lillian you have not promised me that you will give your faith to one who seeks it." She was kneeling beside him. "The barrier! the impassible barrier!"' She looked up-the barrier to him was passed-the confines between life and death-between him and eternity; the paralysis had reached his heart. "Lillian, dear Lillian-let me share your grief!" He was kneeling beside her-her head drooped upon his bosom; she did not answer--she had fainted. 23          1   264        TojTToTAN: OR, CHAPTER XVIT. MR. CARROLL undertook the settlement of his de. ceased son-in-law's estate--it was found in a sad con- dition, having for many years neglected to place his house in order, that he might depart in peace. Death had been to him as to all the living remote, and he doubted not, that in any event, his estate would prove sufficient to meet all contingencies. Disheartened and full of sorrow at the course of his lovely and beloved wife, his mind seemed weakened by disappointment and continued anxiety. There were only two alterna- tives presented to him-either to bear patiently her petty caprices, or to strive continually, and never be at peace. After finding all his efforts vain, to recover her from the path of folly-all apparent hope was re- signed, and silent prayer and tender watchfulness were the only expressions of his mental struggle; it had been too much, even for a strong, stern nature like his own; and this had been the real, if not apparent cause of his death. The thoughtless and giddy, like herself, said that his place would soon be supplied by a younger and more congenial suitor. The wiser and more ex- perienced shook their heads, and said she had much to learn-which was true. She had not yet been ap- prized of Lillian's good fortune, but rejoiced that she would never trouble her more; being separated by a gulf, over which she had no object in passing; deter- mined, if possible, to obtain Travers for herself. He   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      265 had scorned her, but what mattered it? Time and pa- tience would soften this enmity or indifference, and he rmight be glad to avail himself of her proffered friend- ship and love.. So reasoned the siren,- with what re- sult will soon be seen. "It is very strange that Mr. Moore did not leave his affairs in better order." These were the words of Mrs. Carroll, who, was in earnest consultation with her husband, upon the-finan- cial matters of thieir widowed child. "He was always considered a fine business fellow, of spendid ability and wonderful success. His prop' erty having been the result of close calculation, and thorough capacities." "He has, however, left her competent to live in the same splendid style, which she has hitherto main- tained?" "I fear not." "My poor child! I do not wish to censure the dead; but he was careless of her good. He has certainly left her a handsome estate?" "I fear- not."' "Why, what have they been doing all these times? They have not lived beyond their income-what has swallowed up his wealth?" "Ill management, or none." " His mind must have been affected!" "I have sometimes feared it;; and think so now more strongly than ever." "What proof is there of his lunacy?" "None; but his manner at times was strange and unnatural since his marriage."   266        LILLIAN: OR, "Perhaps Florence conceals many things which it might benefit her to inform us." "I have not dared to question her-fearing that it might revive her grief, in its first sad shock." "You say there is nothing remaining; it appears strange andi iinconsistent." "There is a claim on every portion of his estate, excepting upon two small stores valued at ten thousand dollars; and as for these, I find a copy of a deed to Lillian Rosebrough, his adopted daughter." '"Humph! just like him," said Aunt Betsey, "re- member that girl, and forget his faithful wife!' "I do not think it like him," replied Mrs. Carroll. "And the deed is valid?" "Perfectly so; that was my only hope for Florence, but it is destroyed. The only eligible portion of his property reverts to Lillian. "Well," said Mrs. Carroll, thoughtfully, "I can not approve his action-it is robbing Florence of her just dues." "There is no end to the trouble with that girl, and I have always told you so," said Aunt Betsey. "We can not censure Lillian," replied Mr. Carroll, "it is the fault of the donor." "She turned his head with: her silly, highfaluting ways." "It is unaccountable," said Mrs. Carroll, "The probability is, he thought there would be enough for both." "Securing the one, without regarding the other!" "Do   not let us judge him too harshy," said Mr. Carroll, "he is not here to defend himself. He was   -THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      261 ever find and gentle, and there is not a shadow of doubt concerning his love to Florence." "His love excelled his prudence, or his judgment,' remarked Aunt Betsey. "She does not yet know the condition of affairs," said Mr.- Carroll, thoughtfully. "Clara, we must shield our daughter from further sorrow." "What will become of the mansion?" "It must be sold-but not immediately." "Thank God! we have enough for her, too; let her return to her 'former-home." The kind and affectionate father wiped his eyes, and adjusted his glasses to the consideration of other mat- ters which were yet involved, and the remainder of the conversation was carried on between the ladies, in an under tone. "She has had a home of her own so long that I fear she will not be-happy." "The best course would be at legal one," replied Betsey. "Compel Miss Lillian to relinquish her chaim!" It was wonderful to witness the dislike and utter aversion with which the latter lady regarded Lillian- the poor, innocent and inoffensive orphan. Time, pa- tience and gentleness-had not softened it, nor effected any change in her early proclivities; with time she had grown morose-;patience but aggravated her, and her antagonism was on the increase. As her charms grew beautifully less,- so her dislike of thee charming in- creased. She saw Lillian moving like - queen- upon the earth, maintaining her steadfast integrity through good and evil-through prosperity and adversity-re- jecting the wealthiest of suitors for an odd and foolish   268        LILLIAN: OR, fancy-and she was simply jealous. What did she hope to gain?   Some one vastly superior?  Now she was an heiress, combining beauty, accomplish- ments, elegance and wealth. There was nothing want- ing to enhance the value of the prize, and instead of rejoicing in her good fortune, she would gladly have resorted to legal measures and robbed her of her newly acquired treasure, before she came into the possession and enjoyment of it. "It is a scandal to the whole house," said Aunt Bet- sey; " a faithful wife robbed of her just inheritance to supply the vanity of a weak and foolish girl-one who is no relation, not even a friend." "You are mistaken there," said Mr. Oarroll, mildly, "she is neither weak nor foolish. Lillian is a lovely, and unselfish child of nature; you do not understand nor appreciate her character!" "Humph!" she answered, significantly; "she takes the sterner sex by storm!" Mr. Carroll smiled, despite his vexation; resuming his labors among packages of unopened papers and sealed documents of every description. We can not say that Mrs. Carroll remained entirely uninfluenced by her surroundings, still she had faith in Lillian, which could not be perfectly removed; she had known her, truthful, consistent, full of gratitude and loveliness, and many other noble qualities by which her character was adorned." "There is time to discover the truth in this matter," said Mrs. Carroll, "before we condemn the guiltless, there is sorrow enough for all, in every condition." "True, true," said Mr. Carroll, " we must bring our daughter home."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      269 He was evidently and deeply affected by his son's death. "She needs our sympathy and guidance." "I fear we did wrong in indulging all her youthful fancies; my conscience has reproached me many times; but I think she has been happy; it can not last for- ever; there must be a turn in every one's affairs. Her life has hitherto been unclouded. "We will persuade her to rest with us in future." "Better bring her home, and banish that foolish, maudling child, who is now competent to take care of lherself." "Betsey," said Mr. Carroll, solemnly, "do not men- tion that subject again. W e love her as our own child, and it would be cruel and unfeeling to adopt this course which you suggest.                 / "Just as you please," was the curt rejoinder; -"you are like all the rest, infatuated with smiles, a sweet face and simpering manners." "Alas! for Eva!" The summer was fading, with the glories which she had brought to life and nourished in her genial bosom. The stream rippled more slowly as it wound its way through the woodland, as if in fear of its coming silence. The leaf trembled with a frail and fading hue, before it changed to crimson and purple and amethyst. Every- thing portended a mournful change, from brilliancy to whiteness, from mirth and delicious freshness to silence and chilliness and gloom. Fires were lighted in :the breakfast and drawing rooms, shedding theirs ruddy glow over the crimson sofas and downy carpets. Now the skies looked down. through the trellis of the little arbor, between the shrunken leaves, hanging lifeless,   270        LILIAN; OR, Lillian's favorite resort, but where she dared not linger in the chill and dampness of the evening, unless it were soft and warm, like summer, as sometimes occurs in autumn. Her spirits had not rallied since the death of her guardian, not even upon the discovery of his precious gift. Undecided what steps to take in the matter, whether to claim it as her own or relinquish all right and title to the estate. It -was hers, as truly as though it descended from a parent or a relative. Aware that her possession of the gift would excite the hostility and animadversion of those who would secure it to themselves, she was at a loss how to proceed- willing that the matter should rest for a season, as every fresh investigation and mediatation of the subject stirred anew the fountains of her grief. When the intelligence of her second misfortune was communicated to Florence-that she was fortuneless- rage and  despair alternated in her bosom. It was deemed expedient that her mother should break the startling news. She was sitting with the family group before the cheerful grate;  the lamps were lighted, while everything conduced to render the scene ani- mated and attractive. "Florence, I  am pleased to see that you know how to endure affliction," said her father, tenderly; "we must all taste the bitter with the sweet, my child. Look ever on the brightest side of the picture-you are young, handsome  and wealthy!" "Of the latter, I can not boast," said she bitterly. "It was not necessary that your husband should leave you anything," replied Mrs. Carroll; "we have enough, and more than enough-it will suffice!"   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      271 "Better keep the estate in our own family,' said Betsey, c" than let it pass to strangers!" Eva was-in the drawing-room, though not with the group around the fireside. - She heard the remark, un- derstanding its significant meaning, blushing deeply. "They may be pretty wily," said Mrs. Moore," but never a penny shall they touch of that which belongs to me."  "No one has expressed such a wish,'; replied the mild Mrs. Carroll, endeavoring vainly to ward off the shafts of malice from the inoffensive orphan:. "Actions are commentaries on design, said Flor6nce. Mr. Carroll was becoming uneasy. Like his gentle wife, he could not endure the thought of wounding those who were innocent. -- "All this talk is irrelevant to the subject!'  "I refer," said Betsey, "-to the- comfortable little donation of your son-in-law to a charming friend of his, Miss Lillian Rosebrough." "What do you mean, Aunt Betsey?' The face and lips of Florence were white with sup- pressed rage. "I was injudicious, forgetting that you had not been apprized of the circumstances.:- Your husband before his- decease intended to relieve the wants and sorrows of that young lady munificently. He presented her with the sum: of ten thousand dollars!" Mrs. Moore started to her feet as if tshe had been stung by an adder-'first pale, then red, then pale. "Ten thousand dollars -to that upstart beggar!" Eva's eyes" flashed fire-it: wasthe first intimation she had received of the fact-her sister heiress to ten thousand dollars! Then she was beyond their petty   272        LILLIAN: OR, annoyances, their jealousy and malice! But, no; she should not touch one farthing of their money. They would go hand in hand, heart in heart, through the wide world, till a home was obtained and peace; a home free from blighting looks and taunting words. She would speak, -though it should -wither her very being. "Madame, your censure is untimely and unjust. - My sister is neither the one nor the other of your ill- chosen and abusive terms!" Betsey raised her hands in holy horror. That she should dare address her superior in that audacious manner was beyond her comprehension. "You are more-you are robbers," retorted Florence, still white with impotent rage. "My dear madame," said Eva, addressing Mrs. Car- roll, "do you sanction these opprobrious epithets; have we proven ourselves such characters?" "Florence, you are excited," said Mrs. Carroll, "you are unjust." "Such persons always find advocates," said Betsey, dryly. "You are forgetting yourself," she retorted. "I am not a woman to endure insinuation and rebuke!" "They will always divide families," said Florence- "have I not told you so-counseling you against their influence? The warning was given in time. You know well what the elder girl -occasioned me--almost separa- tion from my husband--a breach that was never healed. It was a blessed day when she was driven from our home and took her departure -for a more congenial position!" Eva had remained standing; deeper, darker, larger, grew the fiery spot upon her cheek; more fiercely flashed the fire within her eye. She would stake her   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      273 life it was false; but why had Lillian not told her all. That page of her history had never been opened to her inspection, neither the cause of her departure from the mansion of Mrs. Moore. She could trust Lillian in any emergency. "My sister, madame, never harmed you; she is not here to vindicate her wrongs, to clear this aspersion from her character; but I know it to be false, and the truth is not in you!' "This contest is untimely, unwomanly, and speaks poorly for the sudden and softening grief which has come upon our son's child. Do not blame ;the inno- cent, Florence," said Mrs. Carroll, gently. "To be sure, she ought -not speak," said Betsey; "she is in the presence of Miss Eva." A cold and cruel sneer escaped the lips of her whom she had addressed; it sounded like the hissing of a serpent. Mrs. Carroll's generous words had struck a tender chord in the bosom of the impulsive child; she had fallen back in her chair and was weeping bitterly. "Mother is so benevolent to the orphan and the dis- tressed that she can not discriminate; there are many worthy whom she might have chosen for her patronage and bestowed the same liberal favors, as upon those ingrates!? Eva could no longer restrain herself; bounding for- ward in the impulse of excited feeling, she seized Mrs. Carroll's hand, exclaiming, "My dear benefactress! my kind mother! you shall be rid -of this monster, of this burden. I would not, I could not remain to be sus- pected of wicked designs, nxd to Ihaw my lovely -and innocent sister abused!"   274        LILLIAN: OR, "Where would the girl go?" said Betsey, with a sneer. "Be silent!" cried Mr. Carroll. "I will have no more taunting, no more harsh words. Eva, this is your home, and we do not sanction your departure from it." His voice trembled as he spoke, showing how ten- derly he, loved the young girl. "Oh, sir, oh, madame, you are so kind! God will reward you, if we can not.: But my presence will henceforth make your home unhappy, and I can not think of it." "We have asked but little of you," said MrA. Carroll, gently, stay with us; you have been, you are our daughter!"  "My words were hasty and impulsive, but my sister has been an angel to me, from my childhood caring for me, preferring my happiness to her own. I can not hear her censured." "I have ever believed her innocent," said Mr. Carroll. "Then you doubt my word," angrily retorted Flor- ence.. "Bless you, bless you for these words," said Eva; "Let me retire; they are like balm to my wounded spirit." The door had scarcely closed upon her retreating figure before Aunt Betsey and Florence united in a volley of invectives against the sisters, accusing them of incredible things, and venting their, spleen in insinu. ations which are more difficult to meet and more bitter to be borne than direct aspersion.   THE BATTLE OF LIE.       275: CHAPTER XVIU. EVA availed herself of an early interview with her sister on the morrow; she did not linger in the break- fast room a moment; silently partaking the morning meal, and glad to escape the surveillance of those whom, she knew to be her enemies. The bright autumn leaves lay scattered over the faded lawn, and whirling past her, formed a carpet to her footsteps.  All the sweet influences above and around restored her native elasticity of temperament, and she was disposed to treat those ills more lightly, to encounter them more bravely than on the preceding night. "Why, Eva," said Lillian, as she entered her private apartment," you are not early this morning; are you the bearer of evil tiding? I hope not." "Do not be alarmed--nothing very serious." "It is something that concerns your peace-I can read it in your troubled looks."- I "It is simply this--Aunt Betsey has an associate, linked with herself-'united in interest, temper, and congeniality. Florence More iS: coming home to live!" These words expressed all, and Lillian trembled for the future which threatened. her sister, unless,. some effort could be made in her behalf to facilitate her re-., moval from her present unhappy position. "But, Lillian, there is one secret which you have never told me; perhaps you do not wish. me to share it-but it has been revealed to me my others!"   276        T TA TTAN: OR,- "What is it, sister?" "The gift of your late guardian, previous to his de- cease." "You have not been misinformed; but the reason I have never told you, this, simply is, that I had not con- eluded to accept the gift. Inclination would lead me to improve the generous donation, but delicacy and duty prompt me otherwise." "You know that this is the only portion of the estate unincumbered?" Lillian started. "No, it can not be possible. He lived like a prince; supporting the most elegant style; how can it be?" a That is the mystery-but nevertheless true. Mrs. Moore is pennyless, as far as her husband was con- cernel!" ' Then it is surely incumbent on me to relinquish my claim to this gift. "It would be very pleasant if you could retain it- no one needs it more than we. I can not remain longer in my present position-it is untenable. There I have bidden adieu: to peace and comfort forever;" The gay and laughing face of Eva was shrouded in unwonted gloom, that struck a deeper wound in the heart of Lillian than words or actions. "What shalls we. do, Lillian?" "I must return the money-there would be no en- joyment in our retention of the gift-although right- fully our own." "Sister, why did you leave your guardian's home?" "Now that you have asked me, I will tell you all. I love my guardian, as you knew--it was due to him in gratitude--but Wavs also the pontaneous offering of   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      2" my heart; he was kind and loving-an own parent could not have cherished a child with more tenderness. I can not recall him-I can: not speak of him without the deepest reverence and& emotion. It was- for this love I was banished from his hospitable and-loving pres- ence. His wife drew up the edict of exile--and we: could but sign, though unwillingly, for he was so ill. I would have remained beside; him until the moment of his death. It seems to me that there has been no grief in my life equal to this. "They say many cruel and bitter things of both you and me; must we endure it?" "I do not know of any alternative at present-give me time to think and look about-to see what can be effected." Wait--wait patiently--my spirit haas not been tamed like yours." "Tell me the secret which has been but partially revealed that night in the arbor." "I thought you knew it all." "Your susceptible heart has been captivated, but I hope that you have good reason for believing it recip- rocal." "I have very little: discernment-but- I know my sentiments lhave mot a glad response." Lillian's face was paler than before. Had he de- ceived her thus? so basely, so falsely! or: had her rejection of his suit influenced him to address her sis- ter?" "You said once that you approved my choice," con- tinued Eva, timidly. "When did he express his sentiments to you?" S" ince the party at Mr. Floyd's."   278        LILLIAN: - OR, "Before the death of my guardian?" "Yes, the evening, before. Matters are still unset. tled. I can not marry him so young, dear Lillian, un- less it be to procure a home for both!" "Never-never---that woman is unnatural who mar- ries for aught but love. "He is worthy, and I am sure that my sister would be welcome-cheerfully welcome to his home." "I could never resign my independence. But are you certain he is not deceiving you?" The smile faded from Eva's lip; surprise and re- proach trembled there in its place. "You are so gentle-how could you think of such a thing. Ambrose Tricilli has, confided to me all the history of the past. He is noble, of princely lineage, and the possessor of an immense fortune, which he ha's in- herited. He has been a Roman Catholic priest, but has now become a Protestant, through the influence of his friend Travers." Did Lillian hear aright? was it the Italian to whom she had referred? The clouds were drifting away- the blue sky smiled upon her former dark and rugged path-the fragrance of roses was suddenly distilled into the bitter draught she had been drinking. ' Tell me the cause of your silence, sister," said Eva, impatiently. "I had misunderstood you ; it has been a mistake fatal to my happiness.." "Sometimes I imagine you are not sane, Lillian." "A most flattering conclusion." "But you say such strange things, and act so strangely." "I will be natural in future; your -explanation has   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      279 lifted a crushing weight from off my heart; I supposed that you spoke of another." "Of whom? Mr. Travers? Ah, your secret is out, you do not confide in me; let me learn to follow your example." "I shall give up this money, for I can not use a farth- ing of it." "I knew you would feel so, Lillian is always right." "-A better day, I hope, dear Eva, is dawning upon us!" "Do not let it turn your brain." "It has been night, a long, dark, dreary night!" "Come with me and make your resolution known. De- liver the deed that has caused so much envy and; un- happiness, that has excited- such an exhibition of ill temper." "If it were you in the situation, would you take it calmly?" "Her father has untold wealth, and all at her com- mand." "What a checquered life is ours-sorrow and joy-- hope and disappointment-all bitter, and but little sweet!" All the members of the family had assembled in the drawingroom, when the sisters entered. Significant glances were exchanged between Aunt Betsey and Mrs. Moore. No one except Mr. Carroll, uttered a friendly, welcome word. "I have come to arrange a business affair," said Lillian, coolly, but boldly, addressing Mrs. Moore, whose only reply was a haughty bow. "A matter of conscience," said Betsey, with a sly twinkle of her eye. 24   280        LILLIAN: OR, "Conscience and revelation ought to govern us all, madame. You know the relation in which I stand to your husband and yourself, Mrs. Moore?' "Perfectly." "I am not ashamed to say that I loved him as a child a parent, trustingly, devotedly." "That was evident." Lillian was proof against all insinuations but continued. "In the noble generosity of his heart, he did not forget the orphan whom he had harbored in his hospi- table dwelling; did not forget her during his life, and upon his deathbed devoted a small portion of his estate to her maintenance." "Yes," sobbed his wife, " to dower an orphan." "He is above your censure, madame; he is beyond it--in that land, where there is not the shadow of re- gret or sorrow, he is safe from malice and from con- tumely." "Do not stop to eulogize him!" "Would that all could know and appreciate his de- parted worth. I am prepared to relinquish all claim to this deed in my possession; it was a munificent gift from a princely heart." "All this talk is superfluous." "Bear with me a while, and do not blame me for ut- tering sentiments which prevail in my heart." "The heart ought always to be consulted," said Florence, sarcastically. "My heart is ever prompting me-perhaps it is wrong to obey its impulses; but certainly now, madame, in your present exigency, the sum will not be thrown away." "Miss Rosebrough," said Mr. Carroll, "-there is no   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       281 occasion for this act of generosity; the deed is yours, and you had better retain it." "Her conscience would not allow her to possess it, or possessing it, to enjoy the legacy." "It is an act of pleasure, rather than of conscience. "The lady has no use for it," said Aunt Betsey, dryly. Still Lillian took no, notice of the remark. "Here is the deed, in his own handwriting." "The man was insane when he drew it up; I can prove that."         / "His mind was clear and firn as the noonday. The only way in which I can account for the unsettled state of his affairs, is the confidence he reposed in his father- in-law, knowing that he couldextricate the knot in which they were entangled. His mind probably was indisposed to the effort." '  "Your suggestions are valuable and acceptable. ( Possibly you will find the deed more so "-and de- positing it upon the table, she bowed and withdrew, saying to Mrs. Carroll, "madame, can you grant me a short, private interview?'7 Mrs. Carroll rose and followed her out of the room. "She has not left her arts at home," said Betsey to Mrs. Moore.             - Ah, that she has not-they are part of herself!" "By this act," said Lillian to Mrs. Carroll, "I have deprived my sister and myself of the home which might have been ours. It was no low nor base motives which influenced me to this self-denial; but the Christian doctrine of preferring others to myself. All I wish to . say is comprised in a simple request:-will you shield my young and friendless sister from the barbed arrows   282        T,TTTAN: OR, of injustice and contumely? They would blight her spirit as the lightning scathes the tender tree. I would have her protected from the evil that is in the world for many years. I dare not say a lifetime, for that could never be. I know your gentle and loving nature. I can not forget it was you who opened the door to us on that bitter Christmas night; neither can I repeat all the instances of generosity and kindness which we have received from your hand. Perhaps it is all I shall ever ask of you, and she may not require it long?" "What does all this mean? I am in the dark." "There are some who do not love my sister; it is hatred which they feel toward her, but she does not deserve it. You know her well enough for this, but her position will henceforth be above all envy or re- proach. Will you do me this favor?" "I will do all that I can for your sister." "I knew that you would." "But what do you mean by saying, that it may not be long she will require my protection?" "Strange events sometimes happen in the chapter of human affairs. I can not tell you now. I am not at liberty-only some day she may be able to return the kindness which you have lavished upon her." "By this last generous action which you have per- formed, all-all is liquidated." "Remember my parting injunction-shield my sis- ter, if you love me!" It was not without some feelings of regret that Lillian had restored the legacy to its rightful owner; it was so sweet to think that there was no more neces- sity for toil and privation, for patient struggling and   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.     283 endurance. Her life had been so dark and bitter-of late full of poverty and wretchedness, that the future picture presented a bright and glowing contrast-a home of love and refinement, shared by Eva, lighted by the star of affection, and cheered by the abiding presence of hope and peace-hand in hand, plucking flowers instead of thorns. But she must return to the former darkness; having rejected Travers, could she look for a return of the love which had been wwwkened in her heart. She had cast it away-the priceless jewel which the world could never again afford. The summer of her life was fading, like the glories of the world around her-like the leaf which floated past her, lying on the-hills and down in the valleys. And she trembled at the thought, that the past could never be recalled-happiness had been extended to her-within her grasp; but now, it was vain to pursue the shadow-- vanishing-vanishing-like the beautiful hope which once dawned upon her spirit. "I did that which seemed but right, and God alone can give results. The future is coming, surely; I must stand prepared to meet its unopened tablet."   * .,   284         LILLIAN: OR, CHAPTER XIX. THE matin bird had chanted his anthem-lingerinag still in the vivid forest-and on the brown hills, where the rivulet trickled slowly, drop by drop down the de- clivity, the summer plants and creeping beauties had hidden their departed bloom, under a wealth of varie- gated leaves. The wind sung in a minor key, and the tall autumn flowers flaunted their magnificent colors in the mellow sunlight. "Acknowledge that our forests are unrivaled," -aid Travers, to his friend; "look at that coloring, rich and varied-all the shades harmonious, yet distinct-- the morning sun has tipped them with its fire." - "Thev are grand, magnificent, but melancholy, like man's departing glory; he exchanges, like them, the freshness and beauty of youth for the white garments of winter-the glow of life and health for the im- mortal vestments of angelic purity. Nature is our best and true analogy--from which, without revela- tion we might adduce the doctrine of immortality, of an Omniscient, Omnipotent Governor, who formed the towering mountain, the majestic oak-who clothed the simple lily, and gave the lark his thrilling notes- who formed the ear to drink the gladness of free and grateful sounds, the eye to behold her inspiration. Let us be silent, while we learn! "And this is the occasion of your late silence? But you have told me nothing relative to the death of your friend."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      285 "The remembrance of it still is painful-though se- rene and solemn as this autumn scene!" "And his wife is inconsolable?" "Till his place is supplied." "Heaven help the man who undertakes it!" "Once she was so young and charming P' said Tra- vers, ironically. "Miss Rosebrough is the most sincere sufferer; but you are perverse on that subject of late. Once I thought myself in your confidence-.-but your moods change with the change of climates-here you are cold and phlegmatic-there, in Italy, you were genial and sympathetic!" At the mention of Lillian'- name, a pang had shot through the heart of Travers-he had worshiped a distant star-" so near and yet so far"-deluding him- self with the belief that she was attainable; that her beautiful spirit might be wooed into union with his own--loving the same things in the material universe, the stars, the skies, the trees, the flowers, all Nature, land her myriad voices! All spiritual gifts-the culti- vation and refinement of soul. He could not relinquish his design. In her tacit acknowledgment of love, she had embodied hope-otherwise she had been lost to him forever. The involuntary mention of Eva's name had afforded a clue to her rejection of his suit. "My friend," said he, "I am weary of the world- youth is fading-hope is fading; we are alone." "A distinguished artist-a man of fame and wealth, weary of the prestige he has sought and won." "All is incomplete, imperfect." "Do not think that I lack penetration, under this   286        LILLIAN: OR, garb of modesty which I have assumed. I have read your secret-I know it all!" Travers turned away from the searching glance of his friend-unwilling that his eye even should scan the record of the past year, or discern the drops of disap- pointment which had mingled in the chalice. Confidence begets confidence-you- wish to keep your own and mine also." "It is not long before I shall claim a lovely and lov- ing bride, with the earnest desire of returning to my native Italy; but you know that is impracticable, hav- ing abjured my priesthood, I have excited the annimos- ity of the church forever. "But you have not told me the bride's name." Travers voice was cold, and his manner impassive-- his friend's words had fallen on his heart like ice. "She is an acquaintance of your's also," said he, tantalizingly. "I had imagined as much-Miss Lillian    Rose- brough?" Tricilli laughed slyly; but Travers concealing his impatience, awaited the answer silently. "In that vicinity-try once more." The sigh of relif was suppressed. "To set you at rest-for I see that your mind is disturbed-it is her younger and more charming sister. Do not suppose that you have a rival--no ore wishes to supersede you." "You have chosen a youthful bride." "Is not the prize worth securing?"  "I know of one only who is equal-nay, superior to her!"   THE BATTLE OF' LIFE.     287 "You are cherishing an idea-her superior is a myth. But what has become of our gipsey?" "Truly--I can not tell; they are wanderers you know, and our stolidity has discourged the pursuit." "Do you not breathe more freely; is it not a relief to be rid of her presence?" "It had become odious and oppressive. But I give you joy, my friend, in your present happiness and ap- proaching felicity. But have you heard anything, of Mr. Moore's insolvency?" "I was going to reveal a bit of news; but you drove it from my mind." "Let me give you an opportunity of recalling it." "Miss Rosebrough has been an heiress." "You speak in enigmas, hoping to excite my curios- ity, which never was very great."       , "And now more than ever it becomes you to restrain all impatience, in that which more nearly concerns you." "I can wait any reasonable length of time." "Very fair. Her deceased guardian donated her $10,00O!  "Are you in earnest?"  "Look at me-truth is my chief attribute-is it not impressed upon my features?" Travers was sorry if this were true-he had, hoped to confer the gift of happiness upon Lillian, by raising her from her lowly and unhappy position, to one of which she was worthy--above want and care--to surround her life with beauty, grace and luxury, in contrast with the dark and solemn past. Now it was her own pre- rogative. He had nothing but his heart to bestow. 25   o288       T ,T'T TTAN: OR, "You said she has been an heiress. What is she at present?" "An humble governess-but superior, far superior in her character and life to those who employ her, to those who are -above her in a worldly point of view. I will not annoy you any longer. She has relinquished all right and title to the deed, in favor of the widow.:' "She has acted wisely-let me tell you, that I re- vere her judgment. You can never know how bitter her young life has been. There are very few who have known the misfortune and sorrow which have befallen her." "It is a bitter thing to be an orphan." "Yes-for a woman to be alone and friendless-cast upon the cold and unrelenting mercy of the word-it would break and destroy some, but with her has wrought the contrary effect; it has softened, disci- plined and perfected her native genius; which looks out from those gray eyes, animating her delicate and in- tellectual countenance, pervading her character. You can not know the depth of those feelings, which lie under a calm and placid exterior. She is different from Eva, and yet, both are priceless jewels, that one might wear forever on his heart." "I shall wear my jewel. tenderly and sacredly!" They had sauntered into a maple grove--where every tree had changed to bright and varied hues-the first to send forth frail and fragrant leaves--the first to fade.

We think of our   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      289 lost ones and weep-we think of our sorrows, and the eternal anthem of Nature lifts us far above the world, and its weary struggle in which we live. The forest is a grand and mysterious-a hidden universe of beauty, concealed under the grass, fringing the margin of the streams; amid the leaves, in every nook, there are golden treasures. The morning air was heavy with the odors of the decaying leaves-and the two friends pursued their way in silence through the aisles of that mighty temple-not made with hands-pointing up- ward its myriads spires-sending upward its myriad voices-upward to the temple, eternal in the heavens! Travers was the first to speak: "I have always desired to behold with you the glory of our autumn forests. You have formed no concep- tion of them." "Only from your sketches-they aretrue copies of the original." "But Art can never equal Nature, with all her per- fections. The spirit of the Immortal Power is want- ing." ( You do not appreciate your genius!" "It is the best and purest gift of the Divinity; it confers a silent, inexplicable and perfect happiness upon its possessor; it is a talisman against sorrow and adversity; -inspiration has but to breathe upon the soul; like the touch of spring upon the sleeping world, it trembles-it leaps--rt soars-the ice melts, the stream responds innumerable flowers of thought spring spontaneously-new radiances--hope and joy infuse their: life into its sacred precincts; itis magical-- indescribable."    290        LILLIAN: OR, "I have never experienced any such joy, but believe it exists. Do not circumstances affect its power?" "There is a peculiar congeniality between genius and sorrow; it almost seems that they are inseparable. The latter is the food of the former upon which it lives and flourishes.'  "And the joy of the one atones for the other." "I can not say, for I have never balanced them." ' Then of late your genius has wanted aliment?" "I have had no overwhelming sorrow--only that which could be met- philosophically." "Come, Travers, shall the friendship of years and the confidence which it begets be weakened by reserve? What is it that presses on your mind?" Travers stopped and gazed into the face of his ques- tioner intently. "Would that I had remained in Italy. It is right that I should feel this bitter and crushing disappoint- ment. I should have devoted myself to my art. There is nothing to torture and disturb-no wearing doubts and aching fears-no blighted hopes; but her reward is sure and constant!  "And you have received this reward-fame!" "Can fame bestow happiness? It is a bruised reed, whereon to lean in time of need; he who has only that, has an aching void within his soul. Fame! I could fling it away, as the wind scatters these dying leaves!" "This is a strange and inconsistent mood." "You have loved-you have reared -an idol before which to fall down and worship. What if that idol should become cold-should meet your costly offerings with silence and rejection; could you shatter it in an   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      291 instant? Could you resign the cherished hope, the beatific vision which you had treasured in your heart?" "My love was once a dream-now, real and tangible; but answer me candidly, have you been rejected?" "With Lillian, there is an immeasurable barrier to our love. She will not tell me what it is, and does not deny that her sentiments are propitious! But her sis- ter is in some way connected with this sad condition of affairs; all is dark, inexplicable mystery." "Can you not seek and obtain an explanation?" "This silence is a matter of conscience, and she would not violate its authority for a kingdom." "Then she does not love you." "She has never denied it!" "Worth is not lightly won; persevere, till you suc- ceed!" Travers made no reply, but resolved that he- would take his friend's advice and keep his own counsel. They spoke again of Italy, of her pure and classic scenes; of the stirring events which had transpired during the latter times. It was a melancholy subject to the Italian, who loved his country with ardor and patriotism which are rarely found. "I would return and fight her battles if she called me; sacrificing my happiness or life upon her hal- lowed altars, if it would but' procure freedom and pros- perity to her fallen condition. But while she lives we hope. Her past is redolent with mighty deeds, from mighty men of valor.

THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      293 CHAPTER XX. AFTER her late generous action, so nobly performed, Lillian had returned to the wearying round of painful duties which devolved upon her.  Conscience ever wakeful, would not allow her to slumber at her post or falter in duty. With the memory of her late bereave- ment, the loss of her best earthly friend overshadowing every scene, she stole away at sunset to her favorito retreat, the arbor, wooed to enjoy its reclining beauties by the softness and warmth of that rich autumnal even- ing. There she found ever a response to her sorrows, and a mitigation of her grief in the silence and repose of the beautiful scene spread out before her. ' "They are fading-fading-like the dreams we cherish, like our earthly hopes. All the visible world is changeable and transient; the invisible is the only firm, enduring and reliable." The words of the poet recurred to her mind, and she uttered them aloud: "In the world's great field of battle, In the bivouac of life, Be not like dumb, driven cattle  Be a hero iv the strife." "It seems wrong," said she in a low voice, "for me  to love! unfortunate to be the chosen object of my heart.

Wherever I turn it is his image intercepts my view; it is his voice I hear in 'the silence of, my soul. Will it always be thus? Is there no release from the one idea of my life?' Her head was bowed in passionate grief and mourn- ing. That she could not conquer the enemy, and establish the right in her soul, subdued and humiliated her. "I can not conquer it," said she passionately, C; I can not!" A low and tender voice interrupted her suddenly; that voice which she had longed to hear, and now to which she fondly listened. "Why should you wish to conquer that which is in- evitable ? Our fates have been linked from the begin- ning; from the time that I met you, when you were a little child-talking of things which were above your childish comprehension-of the blue sky and the world beyond. Our tokens then were pledges of the future, which is present." Lillian was trembling violently, and the soft color of her cheeks had deepened to a vivid blush. "Do not press me further; you can never know the reason of my rejection." " There is no barrier, love, but that which exists in your imagination; it is wrong in you to withhold con- fidence from me, who adores you. Let me know your reasons; unreasonable though they be, it will soften my regret, or serve to remove this fiction that you have embraced as reality." "I would have had you wed one whom I thought you    THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      295 loved, and whose happiness must be preferred before my own. By all that is sacred, I have pledged myself to defend her interest with my life and strength!" "Nobly have you endured the test, my Lillian, dear Lillian. Now I can look down into the crystal purity of your soul, as into a mirror, and see its guileless inno- cence, and unselfish disinterestedness. Now I love you better than ever; now it were impossible to relinquish my claim upon your heart! The barrier has fallen! Eva loves and is betrothed to another!" "When did you discover this?" said Lillian, also in- tensely agitated. "It has only been of late revealed to me, and all that time I was deceived." "Yes, dearest-deceived by the fondness and con- scientioUsness of your own heart. But it is past-the mists are rolling away from the morning-it is break- ing-the dawn of our happiness." Lillian bowed her head in grateful assent. They were silent; there is a time when words are mockeries, when silence is the most expressive language of the heart-and so he held her hand, clasped within his own- side by side; the sun going down behind the forests, leaving the halo of his glory in the sky and on the earth. The sweet peace of the scene was reflected in their hearts--its radiance lighting up the present and the future. "Our fates are linked," said he, "they are indis- soluble." The withered foliage of the vine fluttered, and a foot- step stirred the dry leaves that covered the earth. "Tell me that you rejoice with me in this happy so- lution of all former difficulties. Oh, Lillian, I have yearned for this hour of rest and peace.' To the dis.   296        Y!TrTrTAN: OR, tant land, amid whose beauties and marvels I have so long wandered, I bore a bereaved heart." (The rust- ling of the leaves was heard again--a quick impatient sound, as if a bird had been broken of his rest and tossed away the covering of his couch.) "But philos- ophy has taught me to combat calmly with the disap- pointments and sorrows of this life, and in com- batting, I have overcome. The old fire that kindled my soul, is forever extinguished; while in its place, a purer, brighter and immortal flame lights my being with its glowing radiance. Look at the sunset-how vividly it illuminates the depths of azure-and that ra- diant coloring is like my love; the sky is like the soul, imparting vitality and beauty to the earth, which is the body. Love is the sun, around which all the other faculties revolve--upon which they feed, and to which they are subservient. Extinguish this light and nature dies-there is no more warmth nor excel- lence, strength nor health in the moral or physical world. Lillian, it is a solemn thing to live!" He had removed his hat and placed it beside him-a sweep of the zephyr stirred the dark waves of his hair and passed over his pale, intellectual brow, with deli- cious coolness-,his eye, kindling with the fervor of en- thusiasm, was turned toward the setting sun; he seemed a being of no earthly mold-of a superior order. "What if that light had gone out in my soul-ex- tinguished by your cold and persistent refusal-there would be nothing left-but ashes!" A groan, as of intense suffering, half suppressed, in- terrupted their peace--disturbing the blissful silence of the hour-but the shadows of twilight had fallen   THE BATTLE O?LIFE.     297 upon the earth, and enveloped the scene in the misti- ness peculiar to that season. "Whence comes it?' said Lillian, gazing through the deepening shadows. "It is not the echo of my heart," said Travers, smil- ingly, concealing the uneasiness which he felt. I Perhaps it is the gipsey girl," suggested Lillian, meaning literally what she said. An involuntary temor possessed the frame of Tra- vers, but it quickly passed away. 4 The gipsey has become a myth. But you have not told me what I long to hear, that you rejoice with me that our hearts are one; that our lives shall blend in one!" "Do you think," said Lillian, earnestness, overcoming her timidity, " do you think that all this time I have been insensible to your love? to the pleadings of my own heart? The struggle and sorrow of my past life, com- pared with the serenity and fervor of the present, makes me silent. I can not tell you all, my heart is full!' "If you are silent-still think of me i' "Ever and forever!" There was a long, deep pause, in which the thrilling emotions of their souls struggled vainly for utterance, sinking down into the quiet of deep thankfulness and bliss. Lillian-was the first tobreak the silence in a low and earnest tone. "I have said that I can not tell you all-but I can tell you nothing.  Often have I wished, wickedly, vainly, that this nameless gift had never been mine- the gift of deep and unutterable feelings-forever- struggling in my soul, like a bird striving to escape his prison bars.

We know not what we are, nor what we shall be!" "Lillian," said he, solemnly, " have you found rest to your soul?" He hung upon her words, as though they were to be his warrant. "It is the invisible hand which has guided me through life-which has opened and closed the flood-gates of my soul-which has nerved me for the conflict-which has brought me through. Sweet peace and rest have descended from the skies!" "Teach me this beautiful faith!" "It is born in adversity-it is nurtured by affliction. The world can neither give, nor take away." "My mind has been convulsed for many years by various opinions; by the: study of dogmas and creeds it has floated without an anchor, and now it would rest upon some sure and firm foundation." ( The anchor to the soul is-Faith!" "Now I can sit at your feet and learn a simple, trusting, elevating faith, which has become so deeply rooted in' your soul; we must journey hand in hand through life, and death shall not divide us." "Love is immortal!'!" said Lillian, fervently, "it links the living to the dead-the visible to the invisi- ble-the real to the unreal-the spiritual to the natu- ral." "I believe!'" he replied, with equal fervor and solem- nity. "What is it you would tell me, dearest, but can not express-?"

Heart within and God o'erhbead I'" A shriek-wild, shrill, piercing, rung through the air, freezing the hopes which nestled so sweetly in their bosoms-chilling their life blood. Both started instan- taneously to their feet. "Who is playing upon sour fears?" said Travers, an- grily. He had stepped outside the little bower in which they had been concealed and suddenly paused-white with the horror which the scene inspired-standing in the way to prevent Lillian's advance. "Do not move, dearest, remain silent;" his emotions communicated themselves to his voice 'and manner. "But I must know what it is."  In a moment she stood beside her lover. It was the gipsey girl, lying on the ground, a crim- son stream flowing from her side over the faded autumn leaves ;-the shining dagger, with which she had infliteAd the wound, still grasped tightly-in her hand-her long, dark, silken tresses bathed in the red stream-.her face, looking up ghastly andcold through the dawning moonlight..  "She is not dead," said Lillian, who had knelt be- side -,her. The pulse and heart still flutter faintly-at the same time she was endeavoring to staunch the dagger wound.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      301 "She can not remain here! What shall be done?" Travers hastened to raise her in his arms, and laid her gently upon the seat within the arbor. "Say nothing to Mrs. Floyd of this. We must take her away. By- this time she had opened -her eyes, wildly gazing around her, repeating his last words: "Yes-take me away." "I will remain here," said Travers, fearing to trust his betrothed in proximity with that dangerous being- "while you, dear Lillian, must order a carriage. The wound is slight, and she can be removed without cre- ating any further excitement." Lillian flew, rather than walked through the damp, misty garden. Left alone with the impetuous victim of disappointed love, Travers scanned her features narrowly, as she lay with her eyes closed, the dagger fallen from her grasp, and the white, still fingers clasped upon her bosom, glittering with the diamond rings which had so often flashed before his eyes. "Italian!" said he, in a low and thoughtful voice. The gipsey, no longer disguised, had caught the words, and again echoed it. "Sorrow forever in the midst of joy--remorse ming- ling with the fruition of hope! Is there no end to all this? So full of happiness, and now so miserable. Although there is nothing that can destroy the bliss of reciprocation, it may be marred but never lost." The Italian, no longer the gipsey, groaned aloud. Lillian returned with flying feet--"It is ready,  said she, breathlessly. The Italian opened her fierce, flashing eyes, to gaze   802         LILLIAN: OR, upon the face of Lillian, and closed them with a heavy sigh. Wrapped in a cloak which had been procured for the purpose, Travers conveyed her carefully to the carriage which was in waiting. Lillian did not return to the trysting-place, the scene of their late joy and subsequent agitation; but wait- ing patiently for the mystery to be cleared up, pale, but calm and firm, entered the mansion. "Where have you been, Miss Lillian?" said Mrs. Floyd, whose watchfulness over her beautiful governess was unintermitted. "In the arbor, madame."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      803 CHAPTER XXI. :TRAVERS felt that it devolved upon him tc elucidate matters, that it was due to his future-bride to remove even the shadow of suspicion from the minds of those by whom she was surrounded. It was vain to attempt concealment; the dagger which had fallen from Azalie's hand, still lying on the grass, covered with dark stains, was discovered; and coupled with the last reply of Lillian to Mrs. Floyd, upon that eventful evening, were ominous to her peace and happiness.  Lillian did not reveal the secret. That remained to Travers. To her also the gipsey's conduct was-inexplicable; she would have given the world to have known all, for it disturbed and annoyed her. Perhaps her lover in- tended it as a test of her confidence in himself; per- haps it was severe and unkind, but life's early lesson had rendered him watchful if not suspicious. On -the following evening he hastened to accompany Mrs. Floyd and Mrs. Carroll to the bedside of the rash and unfortunate girl, that they might hear the truth from her own lips. Azahe had been conveyed to the house of a n Italian nurse, her wound being dangerous but not fatal; re- quiring the kindest and the most skillful treatment. There she tossed and moaned upon her couch, the spirit wound still deeper and more incurable than the dagger thrust. The ladies were ignorant of their destination, but had accepted the proffered ride with pleasure. OPI   804        LILLIAN: OR, ' Will you go with me to visit an unfortunate in- valid?" said he, addressing Mrs. Carroll. ' She has no friends here, and would be grateful," "If she requires our care amnd sympathy, let us go," she replied without affectation." "These are times,' said Mrs, Floyd, deceitfully, "when all must require sympathy and aid.-" C"Yes," replied Travers; "and it is the good Samari- tan who supplies that sympathy and aid." Lillian's namer was mentioned but once during the- ride, and then in a spirit of bitter detraction by Mrs. Floyd; but the angry and scornful glance cast upon her in reply, successfully restrained all further attempt. Arrived at the house of Cazina, the Italian nurse, Travers handed the ladies silently from the carriage, preceding them up the flight of steps and through the narrow passage, cautiously opened the door of the apartment, into which they entered. It was small, but cleanly, and the lamp burned dimly on the marble table. The white drapery of the couch was drawn aside, scarce- ly whiter than the face which looked out from within. "You have come," said she; " come at last---it has been so long-- so long! But where is your bride? I would not harm her, believe me. I wish to see her- will she not come?"' "My betrothed," he replied, "has suffered deeply! I would not pain her with this scene." "Azalie sighed heavily, "But why did you leave your home and friends for this inhospitable olime?" "Do you ask me," said she, her dark eyes flashing fire. "Dare you ask me? Had I not vainily sought your love, even when it was denied me?

There are many who would repay your love with a worthy and devoted offering. I have no heart to bestow. Preserve that gem within the sanctuary of your soul, until it can be replaced by one of equal value!" " "Why do you talk thus to me? Your words are idle and ineffectual. It is too late now; you do not know my wild and passionate nature. I can never love an- other!  Would that I never loved you!" "But I  am innocent! never by word or look did I seek your love-it was bestowed gratuitously." "Say no more," said she, bitterly: "leave me to my fate, which is not death, but living misery!" "Despair is unnatural!" "But you have taught it me!" "I shall come no more!  Cazina must care for your comfort, and she shall be rewarded!" "No, do not come again-do not mock me with vour presence; neither do I desire yoer sympathy or care- they are worthless, like my love!" "Farewell, unhappy Azalie-!" ,  Various emotions contended in his heart for mastery, as he led the way to those who followed. That her love was genuine, he could not doubt; it was not love, but a  wild, passional idolatry; nor was it evanescent, but increasing daily; and he believed that perfect   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      307 separation was absolutely required. He had said "farewell," with that intention. "What can we do?" said Mrs. Carroll, " to alleviate her sorrow?"  "If any could find the way to her heart, dear lady, it would be you." "We must use our best endeavors."   i When the door closed between herself and the ob- ject of her love, Azalie uttered a low but painful cry. A new impulse seemed to seize her, and she called to her nurse--"Cazina, come hither!" "Give me my jewel case!" added she, authorita- tively. "The physician has prescribed perfect quiet, my dear lady," was the gentle expostulation. "My jewel case," was the stern reply. "I shall not abide the consequences-they rest upon yourself!" "I do not like so many words!" The -nurse was an Italian, but Azahe had acquired a very good knowledge of English, as she was ready and intelligent-she hand spoken in the latter language, which- in her foreign accent sounded musically and sweet. It was vain to argue with her, it were unwise to thwart her wishes. The jewel case accordingly wa 8 taken from its carefub concealment and placed in her hand. The spring was touched and a glitter of valu- able gems,flashed from the velvet lining. "Diamonds! diamonds!" said she, passionately, "I would exchange all for one tender glance, one loving word, whose sound has haunted me for many a weary day!, They are: useless-they'ce never confer a: mo- ment's peace or happiness-vain, glittering treasures,   308        T TrTTAN: OR, flashing upon me with false, unfeeling eyes-what is wealth without love? A bitter mockery!" "But have you not love, unfailing love, dear lady; and beauty and talents and wealth. Why will you thus persist in throwing all away?" The Italian girl fixed her dark, mournful eyes upon the face of her nurse, regarding her intently for a few moments. "Listen!" said she, fiercely. ', I have thrown away the love that once was mine, chasing a dim and cruel phantom. Once, I had thought it was within my grasp, but it vanished in thin air. Having thrown away that which was in reality, mine, to pursue that which was not mine, which can not be--happiness is a myth, peace is a mocking vision! I had staked my all upon the die--it is cast and lost!" "There are many hearts, lady, which throb only for you, for your welfare and happiness; if you would lay aside this foolish fancy, which results from a distem- pered mind, health and peace would be restoredit can not always be night, even at the poles the sunlight bursts at last upon the frozen earth, and over a rejoic- ing multitude-look away from yourself! turn your thoughts homeward." *"Still more bitter! I have broken those loving hearts; they beat for me no longer! We have not heard one word since the message was dispatched.' Her eye-lids drooped, and her passion eemed melt- ing away with the gentle and touching remembrances following in this train of thought. She touched an- other spring, and the jewels gave place to 4two exqui- ,site-paintings, delineated on ivory, in heavy gold set- in hev- odsel   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      309 tings, ornamented with rubies and opals in elegant designs, grouped in flowers. "There should be some sympathy," said she, appeal- ing to the nurse, "between us, we are of one household of faith, of the same country! look on these faces and tell me! is my grief a trifling thing?" The nurse took the case, and an emotion -of pity for the wretched girl stirred within her bosom; the face of one, Azalie's father was dark and sinister, there was something noble about the forehead, while the mouth expressed firmness and cunning. The contour was purely Italian. But the other was an exquisitely beau- tiful face-Azalie resembled both-the fire and cun- ning of the former flashed from her piercing eye, the softness and vivacity of the 'latter lurked about the nose and lips, indications of variant characteristics. The tears fell thickly through her fingers, which had been clasped over her forehead and eyes. "Oh, Cazina! take me home! let me gaze once more upon those faces living! let me feel the cooling breezes of the snow-capped mountains! let me see the deep blue sky, the flashing waters of the glorious Mediter- ranean! I shall die in a strange land, and there will be none to mourn my death! But no, I can not die! even here it would be gratefully accepted!" She had seized the hand of her attendant and wrung it in the transport of grief. "You are going home when your friends have come -there has not been time yet for a message to be received--they will not delay a moment, but fly to your relief!" "Cazina, do you know what paralysis is? then only   310        T,TLLTAN: OR, can you pity mee--to have a cold and dying spirit within a living body-such is my fate!" Their conversation at that moment was interrupted by a knock at the door; the jewel case was hastily closed and restored to its place; the traces of emotion were chased away by the look of settled calmness which Azalie instantly assumed. 1   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.     3s1 CHAPTER XXII.

"Yes-I would do even that to obtain his love, but: it can not be-if she even lost, he would not be won!"' "There would be hope." "No--nodo not tempt me--do not delude me. I am going back to Italy-away from him-to die-to be buried beneath the shadow of the kindly Alps." "You might at least make the trial, there would be no harm."               , The Italian had grown thoughtful. "Then he would hate me!" "What matters it, so long as he does not love?" "I If I could but succeed." :   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      315 A flush had over-spread the pallor: of her counte- nance-a faint hope seemed to look out, from her eye, just awakened in. her spirit. She was sitting upright, regarding her new friend with an eager curiosity. "You had better follow my suggestion,: soo as you are capable of the effort?"  "To-day or to-morrow.'  The tempter; immediately perceived her advantage. She was fairly won. "Do not be hasty," she answered, in a soothing voice, which was calculated to produce the contrary effect. "They are keeping me here, when I am able and strong-they have deprived me of freedom-I must breathe the fresh air! Give me liberty again!" "It is easily obtained. I will send my carriage for you, and will come and accompany you to her dwelling. "Do you know them both?" A sudden light seemed to flash upon her; not a look was lost upon:Mrs. Moor e.  "I have met them frequently; noticing this foolish fondness, and total disregard of others. The girl has won him by her false representations and cunning arts.'  "She does not look so!" "Ah, there you are deceived, like others-so sweet and plausible-L-but it is all assumed; as gilding hides a worthless metal. You would confer a benefit upon him in dispelling the illusion." "I desire his happiness, too." "Then follow my suggestion." "Lady, whoever you are, I can scarcely believe it is   316        LILLAN: OR, my interest which actuates you. What sinister motives are concealed?" "If you can not trust me-better close the oonfer- ence." She had spoken with an air of injured dignity, and at the same time rose to depart. "Well, do not leave me just now-perhaps we shall understand each other more satisfactoriy--itf you will state the case explicitly, for your language is still new and strange." "It is simply this-you are not able to ride-but a great deal might be accomplished in another way. A single line would startle her from a delightful dream-.. for 'Trifles light as air Are to the jealous Confirmation strong.' You own heart will dictate the words. Dispatch them by a trusty messenger to Miss Lillian Rosebrough, and await the result, which seems to me inevitable." "As you say, there can be nothing 16st and some- thing yet effected." On the following morning a strange boy handed Lil- lian a sealed note; it contained a fearful and compre- hensive sentence: "He who has betrayed one can not be faithful to another."   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      81 CHAPThER XXIII. LrTTTTAN had as yet gained but one point in her brief and ardent struggle for appreciation and remunera- tion-and that was strength- dr courage. Her literary career was; concealed from the multitude, for her labors did not cease with the instruction of those over whom she had the care.- Her mind was prolific, and some breath of inspiration, clothed her fancies and her thoughts in the sweetest- and most flowing measures. These had lent their grace and charm to the Journals of the day; but the poetess was still unknown." The pecuniary benefit was small-but the etfect upon her heart and life, incalculable. It solaced her grief-gave expressionto her joy-- lifted her soul on wings-relieved and transported. Every day brought fresh results and en6ouragement' to. her gentle teachings, and althoigh the same coldness existed between her employers and herself, sometimes changed to petty annoyances, she had resources of unfailing pleasure, and was, therefore, strong and hopeful to endure. The Italian's warning could not fail to poison her present and future happi- ness, if the mystery were not soon made clear. Some- times she resolved to tell him all, and thenihesitating- fearing-was irresolute. She ha:t rightly determined the source: from whence it emanated ,and that' only in- creased the diffinulty and- doubt within h6r mind. She dared not think him false, but there was 'a shadow be- tween them, changing to a substance. She became cold and abstracted. Her lover observed the change,   318 .LILr jTIAN: OR, and wondered silently. He had simply said of the gipsey:. "That she was a poor, unfortunate Italian, whose reason had been affected by sorrow;" and that was scarcely satisfactory to Lillian. The days were short, seeming only a few hours from lawn to twilight, the cold had become intense, and the round of winter festivities monopolized the gay and fashionable. Although Lillian was often favored from the precedent made by her departed guardian, shehad withdrawn entirely from the world since his decease. Mrs. Floyd indulged :indiscriminately. Lillian sat alone one evening; everything was silent within and without;i the fire leaped up from the open grate with a soft, sobbing sound, its cheerful glow sometimes diffused over the apartment, sometimes sinking down into dark- ness. She had ordered lights, but was'lost in her now solitary reflections. Would Travers be present that evening at the gay festival? would -lie miss her? and the warning rungagain through-the SilenCoj 'SOf what are you thinking, Lillian?" said a voice, suddenly, beside her. She started and turned pale for she thought he had read her thoughts. It was her lover. "But I   thought you were at the party'," said she, coldly. "And you did not hear my ring, nor my step? and do not wish me to remain?" "The last conclus'on is hasty." "Lillian, I eoultd not go to that gay asserablage to- night, and shall I:tell you why? Because- your late coldness has distressed and grieved me. What have I done deserving this?" Lillian trembled and remained silent,   THE BAT'TLE OF LIFE.     319 ' You are tremblings you are cold; my Lillian is weeping." There was a long and painfulpause.   :; "I can not tell you; not a word," she- replied, falter- ingly. "So unlike your usual candor-there is something wrong, and you will not confide -the. secret?" "Hermann," said she, quickly, " tell me all about the gipsey."    "I have told you,: dearest, and you are unbelieving." "Tell me again?" "She is a poor unfortunate lunatic.' "And were you friends in Italy?" "I knew Azalie there-yes, we were friends." Lillian's heart replied, "It is true!" but the words were not spoken. "And shall this divide us? Oh, Lillian, am I de- ceived? You do not love me, or you would not ques- tion my fidblity.  Have I not laid open my heart to you? When I told you of my early disappointment- that you were not my first love-it was that conscience demanded the confession-inclination would have sup- pressed it-tell me that you trust implicitly, or I doubt your love." There was another long and painful silence-Lillian desiring to reveal -the whole, and yet irresolute. "Lillian; you know: not, what you do,"' said he, solemnly-"You shake my faith in: woman-in truth- in heaven:! Do you know,"  he 'continued, Mrapidly, "that I have often been tempte d to: skepticism1? I have stood upon the brink of the fearful preoi'pice,.and looked down-down--into the terrible gulf below. '.If you can not ,trust me, how. should I believe in you--   820       T TTAN: OR, and if not in you, in whom? in what? My destiny is in your hand!" Lillian shuddered involuntarily, and she answered: "No, mortal can shape - another's destiny-your words make me tremble-can you measure the Infinite by the finite? would you bring Him down to our feeble apprehension? We are but atoms in the scale of be- ing-how many grades 'may then exist above us and beyond us? from our feeble natures upward-tend- ing nearer and nearer to the still unapproachable ma- jesty of the Most- High." "But did you never doubt, Lillian?" "Never!" "Then you can not sympathize with me?" "It is the voice of the tempter." "But if I should lose my faith in you, I should lose my faith in heaven!-" "Your words are strange--they grieve and disturb me!" "Dissipate my doubts! tell me, then, that you will trust me implicitly, though all the world should strive to alienate us. I demand this love- nor will I rest in any other.: Lillian,- beware how you trifle with my heart-it is in your hands!" "I trust you," said Lillian, with evident hesitation. "But it is not perfect trust--your heart was not in those words- it is not unconditional, implicit!" "Can I trust blindly?" He- started to his feet-"Can you love blindly? There has been a mistake," he continued,' coldly. ";A woman's love is vain and false! I have told you- the truth-you do not believe, therefore you do not: love. We part, Lillian," -said he, with stern solemnity--   THE BATTLE O0E LIT . E. "think on what I ask, confidence and perfect love-we part until you bid me' Come !'e" Lillian was awed--silent-helpless He went out and the door closed; then she sank down with a low and suppressed cry of heartfelt anguish. Thefire had died out--there was no light in the roomthere was corresponding darkness in her soul. At '   322'       LILtIAN : OR, CHAPTER XXIV. THE elastic temperament of. Eva was proof against sorrow! for her position was also trying and uncom- fortable. Notwithstanding all the kindness of her friends, envy, wickedness and malice assailed her on the other hand. But her native independence re- asserted itself, and she was cold, haughty and uncom- promising to those whom she could not love. The future wore a roseate hue--she had an object for which to live--one who commanded her respect, her confi- dence and love. The disparity in their years was never observed-he was regarded as superior and noble-and her heart was given with childlike grace and simplicity. Disdaining to ask favors of those from whom she had received so many, her ingenuity was many times taxed, but secretly, for they would have denied her nothing. Unlike Lillian, she possessed no superior mental gift, but the delicate tracery of her needle displayed taste and a remarkable proficiency. In that way she had resolved' to obtain her bridal trosseau. To Lillian alone was confided this little secret, and then with some misgiving. . "Oh, if I possessed your beautiful gift'" said she, "the world should vibrate to my harmonies." l Never desire it, my Eva, it is prolific of pain as well as pleasure, and the world can not appreciate it." "The world may be tardy of acknowledgment, but will be just at last. And your lover knows nothing of the jewel in your keeping?"   THE- BATTLE OP LIFE.      323 At the mention of that name, Lillian turned pale and remained silent;-the change in her countenance and manner did not pass unobserved, but!was not at- tributed to t.! right cause. "Ah, you are fearful he will think poetiy inconsist- ent with every day life; but you, caxn disprove this statement."  "Life is a reality, but truth is many times stranger than fiction!"  "Lillian, why do you evade all my questions that relate to your. engagement? ' I know that it is not ti- midity and fear. There is some secret source of sor, row connected with the subject. Is not the future full of promise?  I must reply, with the Poet:   " "Trust no future howe'er pleasant,  Let the dead past bury its dead: Act-act-in the living present, Heart within and God o'erhead.'  The fairest promise, like the rose, is often blighted in the bud!" -"Your words are ominous, notwithstanding their assumption of gayety."    ,      -  - "Eva, there :isone promise which I made in child- hood, still binding upon me--to secure ;your happiness first of all.               ;  ; Thee ligait-hearted girl started, and gazed earnestly at her sister. - ' But that promise, dear Lillian, can not: involve any sacrifice?"    .   . ."' .  ",-No2-but'it still demands my earnest consideration, fully believing that he whom you liave chosen is worthly  -.-   . .    ., s i   4-3--       ?.TjIANR: OR, I shall wait the consummation of your rows,. and then Moae It am released." "You have been a dear, loving sister, but I Och never understand you, and my endeavorsfail!" "I fail often to understand my own heart; but some day there shall be no secrets -between us."  "That promise is gratifying. But have you written the National Hymn, from which you hoped so much?" "Yes-written and dispatched; but can I hope -for -any good result? My chances are infinitely small?. f"Y our must be-prepared for either event-.success or failure." "The former would be a pleasant surprise, and the latter only a realization of my fears, and therefore, no disappointment." "But I believe there are fame and happiness in store for Lillian." "Because you love me." The interviews between the sisters: were seldom free from restraint. They knew that many eyes were upon: them; that their innocent thoughts and words were misinterpreted or misconstrued, and that, they were often subjects of the most cruel'animadversion. The National Hymn to which Eva referred, had been demanded by the public, and a prize ffered for lines! which best embodied the patriotic sentiment;- Lillian had entered the list, scarcely daring to hope for victory. Her only relief from sorrowful and oppressive; thoughts, was found if a earnest- and faithful performaae -of her duties; in mental and physical exertion. Not*- withstanding jer assumed stoicism,she awaited impa- tieatl-the decisionofthe- judge. She had throwFnther, soul into her poem. It had required profound thought   THE BATTLE OF IIFE.      325 and many draughts of inspiration, the theme being more difficult than those plaintive melodies which were '-her peculiar gift. There: are some measures which flow from the heart naturally, as water runs from the rock. But when it was completed, she had leisure to e think; her manner became abstracted, and her look painfully absorbed. Eva and her lover, Tricilli, perceived that there was something wrong, and could not investigate the matter, for her coldness seemed to forbid all approaches to her confidence. Sometimes they attributed it to anxiety attendant upon her literary labors;. but no, it was something deeper and more important. - Many days passed in this unhappy condition--in which she, saw and heard nothing of her estranged lover. Did he intend to fulfill his rash promise? From her heart she could not bestow the unbounded confi-m dence required, until her doubts- were satisfactorily answered; xshe could not, therefore, bid him come. The seal which had rested upon her silent expecta- tions was at last broken. --They-were ebrowned with victory, when she- had almost, ceased to look, and feared to hope.  "It is a blessed. prestigeof sucess," she murmured; "perhaps the draught of Fame will be so sweet; it will compensate. for all the pleasures lost. The broken dreams-the shattered idol. It is coming it will surely suffice for all. And:if I walk the eart'tfalone, there is one doiwer I can possessf. "  The National Hymn was to be rendered  at the Opera--the authoress still unknown, and the little party consisting of Lillian, Eva and Tricilli, had se-     326        LILLIAN: OR, cured a private box. Mr. and Mrs. Carroll consented to accompany them. There was a secret pang at Lillian's heart at the ab-, sence of one who'could have rejoiced in her success, as he had sympathized in her sorrows. Tricilli mourning the estrangement of his; former friend, cold and distant to every one, and who had refused his presence to the little party, assured Eva that it was all a dark, impene- trable mystery, of-which he knew nothing; but that she might rest assured of his ready compliance with her wishes in consonance with his own. In prompt attendance upon the little party to the Opera, Lillian hoped -and feared, rejoiced and mourned, so inconsistent is thehuman heart. While lingering at her toilette, her gift was at last appreciated and remun- erated. But with her triumph blended many regrets, and she scarcely thought of the lovely face reflected in the mirror, on that eventful evening. Lillian's attire was elegant, tasteful and becoming. Her dress of garnet silk was trimmed 'with rich and costly lace, falling from the fair, white neck and deli- cate hands of the wearer. A rosy hue fluctuated on her cheek, from lighter to deeper shades or paled en- tirely away. Her hair of a peculiar tint of brown, long and silky, was confined with bands of gold. The'seat of thought or'the soul evinced itself from the high and spotless forehead, curving 'away from the temples in fine and- delicate lines. Her' dark gray eyes, changing with every phase of feeling, shaded by heavy lashes, were indescribably lovely. A smile full of pensive in- telligence and, winning sweetness, "without affectation -or vanity lighted up the whole. And the'ensemble: of those features replete with a varying expression, which   THE BATTLE OF LFir.      327 can not be portrayed, emanating from the lights-the shades, the reflection of the face, from the inner life- as sunlight is diffused from heaven, bathing every ob- ject with its soft and glowing tints. If she lacked the vivacity and pleasantrie of Eva, it was doubly compensated. Eva had selected that exquisite shade of blue so long coveted, of the same material as her sister's. Her eyes, blue as the sky or waters, were filled with an incessant play of innocent and mirthful emotions. Her forehead was lower and less conspicuous, less strongly defined, and her hair of a lighter hue, was suffered to ripple gracefully away from her radiant face, falling in a light and golden cloud. Her features were delicate and classical; on that evening she wore pearls, the gift of her former friend. Mrs. Carroll was attired in a dress of royal purple, which fitted her stately figure with a perfect grace, fall- ing to the floor in heavy folds-a white opera cloak, thrown lightly over her shouldes, elaborately embroi- dered by Eva- a tasteful head-dress, of black lace and flowers, which relieved but did not conceal the waves of her silver-threaded hair, completed her ap- propriate toilette. Majestic, gentle and self-possessed, her appearance assured the beholder of a firm and reli- able character, fitted to influence all who came within her sphere. They formed an attractive and charming group. Despite Lillian's resolution, as theydescended the stairs and saw only Tricilli and Mr. Carroll, sh( would gladly have returned to her lonely chamber and prayed for strength and guidance. Could. he so easily relin- quish his claim? or was he proving her? It was a 28   328        TILTT,TAN: OR, cruel test, and unaccustomed to deceive, she became silent and reflective. The conversation was light and entertaining, and deeming herself unnoticed--though she was not-took no part in their jokes and merri- ment. The opera house was thronged. But from their box a fine view was commanded of the stage and house. Wherever they turned glances met them, full of inquiry and admiration. Their social circle was so limited,-and their appearance in public so rare, that they were as strangers to the fashionable world. Lillian's eye wandered mournfully over that vast assembly, as if looking for some beloved object, and she started suddenly as it fell upon the one whom of all others she desired the most to see gazing at her with an air of indescribable sadness, which reflected itself from her own countenance. '"Why, Lillian," said Eva, " if there is not Hermann Travers, all alone!"  But she repented the words instantly, for her sister's face grew pale as death, but not even a sigh escaped her. She had learned control. Anxious to dispel the unhappiness of which she considered herself the inno- cent cause, she added immediately: ' And there is Aunt Betsey looking directly at us! ' Such imprudent, inconsistent young ladies should not appear at the opera,' she says, mentally." "Eva, she is conscious of being the subject of our conversation."             "Well, is it not flattering to be observed and ad- mired?  "Not in that way!" Lillian's attention was at that moment attracted to a group of military men, entering a box not far from   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      829 their own. There was one who seemed their Euperior -a certain nobility distinguishing him from his fellow soldiers-his hair was white as snow, his brow lofty,/ but bearing deep furrows of age or thought-which, could not be determined-seeming old, while in the prime of life-noble, as if bowed by secret sorrow. There was a peculiar and irresistible fascination about his face, that riveted the beholder instantly. "Well, Lillian, speak! before you are petrified- whom do you see in the crowd? Mr. Tricilli, come to the rescue-carry her out into the fresh air." At that instant the curtain rose, rounds of applause. ' greeted the star; then deep silence pervaded the house. A blast of musical instruments announced the opening. It melted gradually away-away-and the voice of the prima donna rose like a bird, leaping- from heart to heart, as echoes leap among the hills. Those accents held spell-bound an assembled multitudes of various temperaments and dispositions, tastes and capacities-- acted upon like the sea, by the commanding power- calm and placid in the sunlight, raging and tempestuous in the storm-and that by a young, but rare and beaU- tiful girl. Music and ox:tory appealing alike to the passions, impulses and emotions of the people. Lillian scarcely appeared to breathe eye, ear, heart and soul were enchained by the witchery of those strains. - The curtain fell, and then only the audience wakened from their short delirium, testifying their delight with unsuppressed murmurs of applause. The next in the programme was the patriotic- song, "Anthem   of Liberty." "Who is the authoress of this celebrated hymn? It   330        LILLIAN: OR, is rumored that a lady wrote the words. Shall we ever know?". Tricilli had addressed his remark to Lillian, but she either did or would not hear; it was observable, how- ever, that her color deepened, and that her eyes were shaded by the long, silken lashes.     The pause was filled up with delightful strains of music from the orchestra. Not one of the little party knew that they were the center of observation, nor saw the movements of their neighbors, Florence and Aunt Betsey, who were nevertheless occupied with criticism and detraction. "Hark! that is the anthem!'" This was murmured throughout the house, and at that instant a loud and thrilling strain of martial music burst upon the listeners swelling higher and more ex- ultant. The audience rose en masse, and remained standing till the faintest murmur died away. The witching siren had appeared before them in the irre- pressible glow of patriotic ardor, kindling every bosom with its deathless fire. She had pushed back the heavy tresses from her-peerless head--lost in the fervor of the theme-shadowed by He starry drapery of the national flag, she was a living impersonatibn of the goddess to whom the anthem was dedicated. The effect might be imagined, not described! Such is the power of beauty and genius when combined. A thrill like that upon invisible harp-strings ran through the waken- ing assembly. The last sound died away, the spell was broken, the audience breathed more freely, while the transport passed in loud and pealing acclamations. Showers of bouquets and costly gifts greeted the re- tiring star. The curtain fell, but at the call of the   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       381 multitude the prima donna re-appeared and repeated the anthem without any diminution of effect. They gazed and listened, every heart kindling with the fire which emanated from her own unwearied and undying. This song absorbed Lillian, and the words, as if they were not her own, seemed to ring in her ears even when the music ceased. The audience were satisfied, having heard that which could never be forgotten. There are some voices, like faces, so peculiar that they leave a lasting impression on the soul, filling the invisible arches with sacred ,f melody. Such was the voice of the prima donna, to which the sentiment and music were perfectly adapted, calling forth -its rich and powerful resources. She sung as she felt,!  When the people began to breathe more freely, each one turned to his neighbor to see if he had been ob- served, There was a sudden, movement among the group of military men occupying the box -by them- selves, and he who had first attracted Lillian's atten- tion as the;- most noble and conspicuous, arose and bowed his head majestically to the audience; a respect- ful silence ensued. "Where is the authoress of this song, of the senti- ment?" said he, in clear, ringihg tones; "if she is in this house let her appear and receive our thanks!" Lillian had been transfixed by the countenance, voice and manner of the speaker, more than by his words. Eva caught her hand, imploring her to rise. His words were instantly caught up and echoed by tie en- tire assembly: "The authoress! the authoress!" "Lillian, you are so stupid," said Eva, impatiently, "Mr. Tricilli, will you not insist upon her rising?"   332        LILLIAN: OR, "And why should she rise?" said Mr. Carroll. "What perversity. She is the authoress!" At that instant Lillian caught the idea more dis- tinctly, and obeying its impulse, started -to her feet, looking over the sea of heads, pale as a statue, from various emotions. Deafening applause rung in her ear; but simply bowing in acknowledgment of their tribute, she retired again from observation, silently as she had risen, like a phantom seen through the mists of morning, invoked by daring mortals. Travers, too, had sat like one in a dream, with his eyes fixed on Lillian, reproachfully and sad. The veteran who had called out the Authoress 1^ef his comrades, and forcing his way through the crowd, moved slowly toward the box where she was sitting; he carried a cane, which was indispensable, for his step faltered as the crowd made way for him. Pausing a moment, in contemplation of the little group, as if waiting to be addressed--all eyes turned upon his strange and agitated demeanor. Lillian was more and more perplexed. She observed him closely, their eyes met in instinctive recognition, it was an eagle glance that transfixed her own. For a while the spell remained unbroken! Then a low, thrilling cry rung through the house--a cry of sudden and intense joy! His arms opened silently, and she fell upon his neck with one word-that word was- "Father!"    THE BATTLE OF LIFE.       338 CHAPTER XXV. THE reunion that followed was sealed with joy and lleart-felt gratitude. Rosebrough listened with breath- -less interest and attention to the recital of his daugh- ters. The early deception and cruelty practiced upon them by Margaret-their removal from the home in which he had left them, and the trials incident to their forlorn and orphaned state. On the other hand, they heard, with tearful eyes, the account ofhis aweary wan- derings through the homeless earth; his return to the cottage, finding it all deserted It needed no artist to depict the feelings of which he spoke but little, but which nevertheless forcibly impressed his hearers, of the search instituted through long and weary years, but without effect. This severance of his fondest ties hav- ing impaited his mind to such a; degree that he was disabled from service, but still supported by the gov- ernment; having labored for his country in stronger and better years, it was remembered gratefully. "I knew," said he, ( there would be recognition, whenever we should meet-so strong is the magnetism of the social tie." "It was you, father," said Eva, "whom Lillian saw, when we entered the Opera House, and I reproved her for rudeness ni gazing so intently. But she said nothing of hpr- suspicions to me!"  How proudly and tenderly the father regarded his darlings; it was difficult to realize they were the same, changed by time and circumstances. Litlian had found   334        LILLIAN: OR, a friend when she least expected it. Had she lost one dearer? He had been drawn to the Opera House that night by the notice of the splendid National Hymn! Such important results to individuals hang upon insignificant events. Attracted to the city by a wandering spirit, and a lingering hope of restoration to his children, he had come just in time. Some concatenation of circum- stances illustrates powerfully the rule of a Supreme Being, whose eye takes in even the sparrow that falls to the ground--and knows the drops that compose the sea, and the sands upon its shore. It had been pre- pared for them. But at this time the Italian girl moaned and tossed upon her couch of suffering. A relapse had ensued the day following Mrs. Moore's untimely visit. Dr. Henry feared- that his skill would prove of no avail, while Cazina shook her head significantly in silent ex- pression of her fears. "The crisis will be passed to night," said he, in a low voice, " you must not cross her will, unless its in- dulgence would prove fatal. It will not do for :you to sit alone with her to-night. I shall bring a friend, Lillian, to share your vigils." "It would be a great relief," she answered, with a sigh. "Be prompt and sure -in administering the potions which are mixed in the glasses!" "Yes, sir, I shall not fail of my duty." Again scanning the features of his patient anxiously, the docter felt her pulse, and turned away -with a sigh. "The fever does not abate; you must watch her closely, and I will bring Lillian to your assistance im-   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      335 mediately. I will come in again at twelve o'clock. Midnight is a trying hour with invalids." Buttoning his great coat tightly about him, and ad- justing his muffler, the benevolent doctor stood a mo- ment before the fire, as if desiring to stay and watch the result; but called away to other patients, by im: perative duty, he nodded kindly to the nurse and left her once more alone with her restless charge. She took her station near the bedside of the beautiful but undisciplined and unhappy girl. At her right hand stood a small marble table, which held the medicines prepared by the doctor. A watch, meting out the mo- ment-to each one his portion-to some fresh hopes, new impulses of joy-to others, drop after drop of the overflowing draught of sorrow, meting out life and death; the last comprising the former, and the former containing the elements of the latter. Transition only, however painful it may be, from a changing to a fixed condition. Cazina dared not turn her eyes from the flushed face of the sleeper for an instant, and amid the silence, the superstitious Italian thought she could discern the ticking of the death watch. She had become strongly attached to her capricious charge--attracted by her youth, beauty and suffering, and a sympathy growing out of their nationality. According to his promise, Dr. Henry drove rapidly to the house of Mrs. Floyd, and gaining the cheerful consent of Lillian, who forgave the pain Azahe had caused her, and the motive that actuated it-wrapped in furs, for the night was intensely cold, she was soon at her post in the room of Azalie, whom she pitied and could not hate, or of whom she could not even harbor 29   386        LILLIAN: OR, resentment. Was her statement true? was she dying of sorrow and neglect from that very person who had won her own heart, and whom she had promised to wed? Her reflections in that direction were far from being pleasant or profitable. She drew closely to the grate where the bright flame leaped cheerfully and fit- fully. She could look, too, at the couch where the object of their solicitude had tossed the covers from her in her feverish unrest. It was well for both, the invalid and nurse, that Lil- lian was present; calm and self-possessed, it devolved upon her to administer the medicine which Cazina could not persuade or force her to accept. She looked at the stranger with her flashing eyes, in which there was no ray of recognition, and yielded passively to the sway of mental superiority. Still there was neither abatement nor change in her condition; but Lilliar exercised a magic influence over her-smoothing the pillow, bathing her temples and hands-gradually be- coming cooler and moist. The hours passed with an invalid, particularly at night, are tedious and lingering, and Lillian looked at the watch many times before the hands pointed to the hour of twelve. Blit the doctor failed to keep his ap- pointment, not from inclination, but from compulsion, as he had driven out of town to see a patient, whom it was impossible to leave. They were silently awaiting his arrival, Lillian benrd- ing over the invalid, watching every symptom with un- disguised anxiety. The flush died gradually away and her respiration became less difficult. "She is relieved," whispered Lillian.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      837 Again the splendid eyes met her own, this time con- eciously. Surprise superseded indifference. "Who are you?" "I am a friend!" she replied, in a soothing voice. "I have no friends,"' she said bitterly, and closed her eyes. "But what is your name?" "Lillian!" "Have you come to look on my torture and my death?" "Listen to me--be quiet and obedient-I think you will not die!"' "No, no-I suppose not,; all this pain, and then no rest. I wish to die!" "But you do not know what blessings life has re- served for you." "Because you are happy and blessed, do not think that I shall be the same! I have lost my peace!" ( But it will come again at your bidding!" ' Lillian, do you not hate me?" -0, no; H only pity where I can not relieve!" "But not for Winning. your- lover's early and best affections?" How keenly -she was looking at her, reading un- mistakable evidences of the love and sorrow of her life. "-No-not even for that!" "And will you keep your promise to him?" "If your statement be true, my promise is invalid f' '( So 'you will spurn him from you?" "Do not ask me any more," said Lillian, somewhat proudly; y( you know enough -already." The Italian bit her lip and remained silent for a little, and then suddenly rejoined:-   338        T..TTLTAN : OR, "You can not conceal the truth--he is dearer than your life. Do I not know what it is to love? Can you tell me anything about it? But all that has passed away like a dream," and she sighed heavily. "Tell me, how you gained his heart?" That very question seemed to shed light on the false accusation of Azalie. How had she won his love? as though it were difficult of attainment-as though she would like to learn the secret. "But," she continued, "we have love charms- and love filters in our country, the beautiful Italy, but even these often fail." "But you did not require any foreign aid?" "I did not resort to foreign aid," said she, cau- tiously. "Love should be a free-will offering, or it is valueless." "You won him by your beauty?" The Italian laughed scornfully. "( And you by gentleness?" Lillian answered, soothingly, "I saw Hermann Tra- vers first, when I was but a child-just after the death of a mother who was all the world to me, and previous to my father's departure, whose absence was protracted many years. We met under peculiar circumstances. Misfortune and disappointment had fallen heavily upon him-my sorrow and bereavement too were new-un- kindness wounded my spirit deeply. He spoke gently to me, gave me a little token which was cherished through penury and want, through care and adversity. I did not hope to see him again; but it is so, and you know the rest. I abjure you solemnly to tell the truth. Has his faith ever been plighted to you?'   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      339 "What matters it now," said the Italian; " you can wed him if you wish!" "Then your statement was false?" she inquired, eagerly. "Should you imagine me capable of such a deed?" "Azalie, I can bear you no ill will, however much you may have wounded me; for the great sun shines upon the just and the unjust, and the dew re- freshes all the earth-so are we commanded to forgive, after the example of One, who suffered for us. But tell me, once for all, is it true?" An expression of pity crossed her face, but she evidently dreaded disclosure, and feigned a sleep, calm and tranquil, which had been a stranger to her eye-lids many nights. Lillian did not presume to press the subject further, in consideration of her extreme state, although she was dying to hear the refutation of her silent accusa- tion. Filled with her new sad thoughts she returned to her place before the fire, leaving the patient to sleep if it were possible. But the conscience of the one was peaceful and   approving; while the other could not rest a. moment from its fearful. accusations excited by the forgiving kindness of her rival. The hours advanced to morning; the soothing po- tion which had been given the invalid wrought their effect, and from feigned sleep she fell into, a real repose, from  which  she did not waken till early dawn.   Her first words were addressed to Oazina: "Where is she?"            ; * "Whom," said Cazina. "Why, Lillian, whom I saw here last night. Surely it was no dream-!"   340        LILLIAN: OR, Lillian obeyed the summons, hoping that now she might elicit something like the truth. "I am here still-the crisis is past! I believe you are better!"  "Should I be thankful? There is only one reason- because I wish'to see my parents, toward whom I have shown the deepest ingratitude!' "And do they know of your flight to this coun- try?" "If the message has only reached them, while I fear the contrary, they would fly to me, wherever I might be; for I have been a cherished idol of their doting hearts-the only friends I ever had?" She spoke unguardedly, and was soon aware of her error, but did not seek to cover it. "I was free and happy, then and there; free as a bird on the wing--happy and innocent. It is this love which has ruined my peace forever! If I could have conquered it--but the achievement was impos- sible!" "And still he gave you cause to hope?" Azalie smiled meaningly. She saw the aim of those words, and answered accordingly. "I have tortured you enough, sweet lady-if I can obtain peace at any sacrifice, it shall be obtained. Let me relieve my mind. The object of our conver- sation came to Milan, to study his beautiful art- to become a proficient. I met him in company with the priest, Tricilli, and my young and warm heart singled him out from the throng of admirers as the only one worthy of its first affections. My parents never denied me a request. I wished to sit for a portrait; not to see my face on canvas--I did not cre   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      841 for that, but to be with him-to hear him speak, and study the face which seemed to me almost divine. Impulsive from childhood, I sought to win his-love by every act and tribute of affection and respect. Confessing my love only to the priest, it was carefully concealed from my unsuspicious parents. And this grieves me more than any other thing. They trusted me and I deceived them. It is right that I should be deceived in turn." She was still adhering to her first statement--that he had deceived her. Lillian began to feel it must be true. "But if he deceived you then, why did you follow him here?" "O, he did not deceive me even that were prefer- able to the hopeless love he had inspired; then I should have some cluim upon him. He never gave me one word of encouragement, one look nor glance. I- followed him, because I could not endure that the great ocean should roll between us. Will you forgive me, Lillian; my heart is breaking for sympathy and love?" "I had forgiven you long ago-and you will accept such as I have to offer--my friendship and prayers are yours forever!" "'You are generous, and I accept your offering gladly; but, , you can afford to be. You want nothing; your world is concentrated in one object-- that object all your own!"? Lillian simply replied, "You must rest now; do not talk any more, or the doctor will accuse me of indis- cretion, and regret his choice in bringing me hithel!" "And you will not leave me long?"   342        LILLIAN: OR, Not until you are convalescent!" This assurance satisfied and quieted her again. The watcher desired to ask many questions-how she\ dis- covered her residence; what or who had induced her to take the step so fatal to her own peace, as well as to Lillian's? She was persuaded that some one had influenced her to that course, and the first name sug- gested to her mind was that of Florence Moore, al- though the Italian had generously suppressed any mention of the fact, taking the blame entirely upon herself. It appeared wise to remain silent on the sub-  ject for awhile; enough had been revealed, that night to set her heart at rest-to ease the weary burden she had borne about so many days. But how could she recall him? By explaining all her distrust and mental detraction of his character? Yes, that was her only course, and though pride might forbid it, the difficulty between them had arisen from her suspicion and tacit acceptance of a falsehood, which she had not the dis- cernment to treat as it deserved. Azalie relapsed into a dreamy silence, and the first rays of the morning streamed upon the couch, through the closed shutters, and the fire light grew dimmer as the dawn advanced. Cazina was nodding in her chair, having been deprived of sleep many successive nights. Lillian whispered to her that she might retire without any anxiety, intending to remain herself until the doctor appeared and pronounced his patient out of danger. The offer was gratefully accepted. When left alone with the invalid, she had full oppor- tunity to scan her features narrowly, as she lay in re- pose, with a tinge of the morning sun upon her pallid face. Lillian was moved with pity. The dark tresses   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      343 of her hair had fallen down upon the pillow, aid 3lus- tered about her face and temples in ringlets. There was an expressionof peace covering the latent fire that consumed her spirit-but it was a peace that had been wooed and won at a great sacrifice-neither was it false, but temporary, arising from the relief occasioned by her confession. The sun rose higher and higher, but the doctor still delayed his coming. His presence was not absolutely requisite, but desirable. She had evidently been growing better since midnight; her pulse beat regularly, and the traces of fever had en- tirely'disappeared. A new field was open to her be- ne olence and consideration -that of rendering the stranger every assistance in her power; who coild foretell the blessed result? Two hours expired after Cazina left the room, before the return of Dr. Henry, who came in cautiously, and without putting a ques- tion, approached the couch directly. At his well- known footsteps the invalid opened her eyes, extending her hand, a faint but pleasant smile gave him kindly welcome. He was satisfied, even by these symptoms of her restored condition. "You are an admirable nurse, Miss Lillian," said he, with unfeigned pleasure; "our patient will re- cover." Do not forget your own skill, doctor, wl en praising others," replied Azalie; "but for your kind attention I should not now exist." "And you are truly grateful," said he,- ith a bright smile. "Can you doubt it?"  "Illustrate yours words by your actions-do not venture any more exertion; talk very little, and con-   844        LLIAN: OR, fine your recreations to sleeping and light medita- tion." "I will endeavor to follow your advice this time, for I wish to return to Italy." "We will see about that afterward. And now, Lil- lian, your eyes look heavy and reproachful-because I have kept you so long waiting, but my delay was una- voidable." Cazina was awakened, and returned to fill the vacancy caused by Lillian's departure. The fresh cold morning air aroused her from her drowsiness, and she resolved not to take rest until she had made the first step toward reconciliation with Tra- vers. Upon reaching her room she wrote four simple but expressive words: "Will you come again?" sealed and dispatched them. -: ^a   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      S45 CHAPTER XXVI. -TTTLTTAN could not deny that the applause which had rung in her ears was sweet and consoling. That she was rewarded for her past sufferings-for endurance. But the heart? She was suddenly elevated to a hight of which she had not dreamed. The idol of the people-admired and caressed-but the heart?- "Thou hast a charmed draught, oh, Fame l A draught that mantles high, And seems to lift this mortal frame Above immortality. Away I to me, a woman, bring Sweet waters from affection's spring." There was yet no reply to her simple but compre- hensive message. Had he cruelly deserted her? But even then she must exonerate him. Had she not cast his love away? Now she was dying for a tender word, a look, a glance, to be re-assured of her place in his heart. The night had set in cold and dark-combin- ing the wild solemnity of the autumn and intensity of winter--the sky was obscured with clouds, and the wind moaned and sighed a perpetual requiem, and still Lillian sat with her hands folded over her heart, to calm its tumultuous beating, and peered out Dtgh the darkness that enveloped the world; sheJ   catch one ray of light, neither on her pale uplifeSe, nor down in the silent depths of her heart. "- Would he not come?"   346        LILLIAN: O,lt But at that very time there was a muffled figure ap- proaching her--battling with the elements sturdily-- intent only on one object-that of reaching his destin- ation. The sudden and violent ring. at the door, caused Lil- lian to start from her dejection. Rising from her seat, her pale cheek still paler, awaited the intruder, for then she could not retreat. She had many admirers now, whom the blast of fame had awakened from their . obtuseness- to the realization of her charms. Who -had ventured to brave the fury of that fearful night? but the door opened and the encounter was unavoidable. The room was dimly lighted, and the intruder paused as the door closed behind him. His face was grave, but tender--and his eye rested upon the beautiful'girl, who stood in silent expectation. "Lillian!  The name was spoken low, but it fell like music on her heart. The spell which bound her melted away, and she was folded to his heart in a long and silent embrace. "Can you trust me?" said he, reading her expres- sive face--no longer pale, but joyful and blushing. "Now and forever!" Thou art the victor, Love; Thou art the fearless-the crowned-the free I The strength of the battle is given to thee, The spirit from above.  The C   ation which ensued was uttered so low, that it clcot be overheard-perhaps better imagined than reported.

But his friend held the key to his destiny, changing his resolution at once--it was Lillian's message. "And to disperse all doubts, let us be one, Lillian; be my bride now, my happiness, nay my life, is involved in this consummation of my hopes!" L . .. .   848        TtrALTT:AN: OR, CHAPTER XXVII. AN unhappy scene was transpiring in the mansion of Mr. Carroll. Florence was filled with rage at the failure of her favorite scheme; she could hope no more from that direction. Travers had not even re- plied civilly to her note, and Tricilli was entirely re- moved from  her influence. She was miserably un- happy, surrounded by luxury, sympathy and affection; continually seeking things unattainable, which all her wealth could never purchase. The morning after the concert, jealousy alternated with joy in her heart-the former whenever she thought of Lillian's enviable po- sition, the admiration, whose tribute had been unfeigned, bestowed upon her by an appreciative multitude; the latter, at her appearance alone, unaccompanied by Travers, who had mingled with the crowd. Then she scrupled not to renew her efforts at conquest, dictating a fervent epistle to the object of her solicitude, whose only effect had been to annoy and disgust the recipient, After this repulse, in a fit of resentment, she devoted her entire attention to Grandison, the rejected suitor of Lillian, who was an easy prey to her charms. The firm refusal of the object of his first choice detracted from his self conceit, and the adulation of the beautiful and accomplished widow was a  panacea to his wounded spirit. He was readily induced to offer her his hand and heart, which were as readily accepted; and it was this intelligence which excited the anger and indigna- tion of her father, who had esteemed his son-in-law as   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      849 a, dear friend, and a kind and loving husband to his Florence. Besides, he had seen the folly and extrava- gance of Grandison, who was fast squandering the in- herited estate, which was his only endowment. Know- ing well that the tide will sweep away untold wealth, he endeavored vainly to dissuade his daughter from"hei rash and fatal step. "Florence, you are willful and perverse!" he was pacing the room with rapid strides and a contracted brow. "I believe my minority was passed some time ago," she replied, scornfully. "And I am willing to suffer the consequences alone!"' "But you can not-you can not! we must all suffer with you!" "Why do you wish to leave us?" said her mother, gently. "Because I fancy Grandison; do not be alarmed for my welfare-he is rich also-and I presume we shall manage to get on quite comfortably." "He is hot rich, Florence, you are deceived; the gaming-table has been his partial ruin. You can not reform him, you will both go down together.'  Florence laughed scornfully. "It is disrespectful to your former husband, who has scarcely been buried out of your sight." "Ever tantalizing me with the past-you kn ww I didl not love him!"      .  "Do you love Charles Grandison, Florence?'1h6 paused in his agitated walk and looked 1keeinly at- her., "Well, if I do not, there is no love lost'. " "Most unhappy  conditions for a marital relation, daughter, be warned in time!

But to marry this man, who has neither moral nor intellectual worth, is suicidal.

She dared not retain any portion of his estate. I shall be my own mistress, fearing no one, least of all Charles Grandison," "If you are resolved to marry him against our en- tire wishes, let it be with different motives and higher intentions. A woman can do much toward reforming her husband, but it is a dangerous experiment." "Yes," interrupted Carroll, " if the blind lead the blind, they shall both fall into the ditch and perish," "' Your quotation is perfectly appropriate," replied the ungrateful widow. Carroll was becoming angry. "You have always been a perverse and disobedient child; the conse- quences of your actions rest u pon your own head." "Certainly, they will never trouble any one else." Mrs. Carroll burst into a flood of passionate weeping, There had been a continued tension upon the nervous system for many months-since the shock occasioned by the paralysis of Moore, whom she respected and loved. The subsequent trouble excited by the presence of Eva and her gentle sister. Under it she had grown thin and pale, which her husband perceived -but could not rectify. His anger was justly excited against the instigator of all these troubles, whom he could not faH!

But her father's anger, a mother's silent tears, were alike rejected, with their counsel. "You need shed no tears for me! my fate will be agreeable to myself." "Florence," -said her father, sternly, " if you persist in this resolution, remember that not one farthing of my estate shall ever pass to you as an endowment. As you say, the years of minority have passed, you are at liberty to decide for yourself, but where my counsel is worthless, so would my gifts be without appreciation! Marry him, if you choose." "You can keep your advice, and your lestate also! bestow it on Miss Lillian or her sister--they would- prove grateful recipients!'? "My child," said Mrs. Carroll, in horror, " how dare you speak that way to a kind and venerable father? I will not hear it!" "She has heard my terms," said he, angrily, and turning on his heel left the apartment. Mrs. Carroll strove many hours to soften her daugh-:  ter's stubborn heart, but the' good seed fell on stony places, or it had no depth of earth, and& could not take root. She was weeping bitterly all the time.; her tears relieved her own heart, but did not move her daughter, who could never be dissuaded from a settled purpose. Aunt Betsey was the. only oie. who sanctioed or ap- proved heg:course,'.chiefly out of policy;hoping to share in the, fortune of her wealthy nephew if Florence were disinherited., It was rumored abroad that she n   30   352    T  -  T TTTTAN: OR,- had found a suitor, but no one ever saw him, or mew the statement to be a verity. Growing every day more petulant and selfish, her presence was a continual and additional source of annoyance to her gentle niece, for who does not know that frequent droppings must wear even stones?

She had become stoical of opinion, seeking her own pleasure in her own way, and gov- erned by the most detestable aims. Had she never heard the voice of the better angel, calling to her to arise and stand against the corruption of a corruptible nature? Had she forever cast away the charm and purity and sweetness of an unblemished childhoods? Alas! the voice was once heard often, but . its reproaches and admonitions grew rarer and more rare, until it had ceased altogether, and only a sudden shock, overwhelming as an earthquake, could startle her-from  spiritual repose-the repose of death!- ,She !:  neither liked the government nor influence of her fond and indulgent parents; in the event of her father's death she would have wept perhaps sincerely, her mo- ther was somewhat dearer, but her natural affection was weak and powerless.

In a few years the residence was exchanged, for one small and less aristocratic, and at last- even that was sold, and Florence returned to her suite of rooms in her father's house. The career of his son-in-law dis- turbed the declining years of MrL. Garroll. As he had foreseen and foretold, all of his own estate and that of.

Did we not advise you to live singly with us? You well know that his estate and yours have melted rapidly away; and now you would deprive your father and myself of our only dependence. What would you do with that amount?" "Discharge a debt that Grandison has foolishy con- tracted." "Yes, by gambling!" Florence turned deadly pale--these words were fearfully true, and she would not contradict them. Grandison had gained the mastery in the contest; she had yielded with discretion to his government, and was now afraid to oppose or offend him. "But he has promised that there shall be no more such expenditures." "And is this the first time?;' She could not reply to that, for his word was invalid, and there was no dependence to beo placed upon it, as had been proven in many instances of the same kind. "I shall never dare to meet him- without the money, or a prospect of procuring the amount of Bome one." "But your father would never countenance it, and I can not deceive him.

It would break my heart, and I know he will never consent." "But you can procure the sum at any time without his knowledge, and Grandison will replace it." "Florence, you-know that is ifnpossible. He has never won at games of chance, but is ever the loser. The ready acquisition of this amount, will plunge him still deeper and deeper into the vortex, and we shall all go down together." ' What would you have me do?" said Florence, turn- ing pale. "There is only one alternative-it is humiliating and sorrowful; leave him to drift out in the current alone. Your influence is of no -avail. Our' future prospects make me tremble; they have added many years already to your father's life!" ' But it is foolish in you to think and feel- that way There is still hope of his reformation, while he has life. What would become of him, if left alone as you wish me to do?"

"As matters stand now," said Florence, becoming excited, "I will not remain here another week. I have one resource left to me, that has never been intimated to you! Another-brilliant marriage in case I can pro- cure a divorce from Grandison." "Oh, Florence, Florence, I would sooner. see you die than do such wickedness!" "My conscience never was like yours-it would not trouble me,. whatever I should do!" "Is it really so obtuse? so irremediably hardened?' ' It never disturbs nor annoys me."

Well, I will see what can be done for you!" That promise was a sufficient security for the full amount. As her mother predicted, another demand followed soon, again discharged in the same way, till two thirds of their comfortable estate had been wthrown away. When the crash came, Carroll succumbed with- out an effort to rescue his sinking fortune, and his death ensued at an early period. The remainder was' secured to Mrs. Carroll by her husband'r last will and testament, and it proved sufficient to maintain herself and Florence, independently of labor, during their lives. Grandison became a wild and- dissolute rover, but Florence never married any other; it was the com- mencement of a wholesome discipline, changing her views, her mode of life and her entire character, till the past was redeemed and a reformation effected. After many years, one wild and bitter w'ater night, Grandison came home, a worn out, weary man, restored to the domestic circle.

Lillian did not forget them in adversity, but for- giving and benevolent visited them with her counsel and sympathy. About the time of Florence Moore's second marriage, when the ice broke up in the river, a body drifted to the shore, carried by the dissolving mass, which was recognized by the lower classes of people, her compan- ions, as Margaret, the woman who had abused and de- ceived the confidence of a -man too credulous and un- suspicious; she had continued her dissolute life and in a fit of inebriation, ended it by a terrible retribution. With Aunt Betsey's years increased her fault finding propensities; as she grew gradually deaf and blind, she was the more disposed to criticize all that was done for her. Forced, however, from her position with regard to Lillian and her sister, because it- was untenable, all the pains and afflictions known only to that unfortunate class of beings at an advanced age, fastened upon her with incurable pertinacity. --Even among the disap- pointed, the unwedded, there are hundreds whose lives have been one continual benefit to the race, blessing and blessed they receive at last the reward of their own heavenly deeds; but for such an one, and she is not an exception, there can be no love, every-kind thought or feeling is dissipated by their moroseness and ill-temper.

One thing was more remarkable than any other-the kindness and forbearance of Florence, who nowhecame the butt of all her reproaches and pettishness; because she had squandered her father's property and her own, and because of their reduced circumstances, attributing it justly to her ill-manage, ment. We will not endeavor to arrive at her true age, but allow her still to remark opportunely; "I am very gray at twenty eight." 31 -     360        LILLIAN: OR, CHAPTER XXVIII. THE soft air began to blow from the mountain tops upon the reviving valleys. The golden tint peculiar to the sky at that season, diffused itself over the varying canopy. The branches of trees grew rosy, thrilling with intense joy and life, agitated with a gentle motion up- ward, imploring their green and leafy coronals with in- cessant sound of prayer, as though they had heard the promise made from  the Flood: "While the earth re- mains, summer and winter,-seed-time and harvest shall never fail!"The "invisible perfume of expanding leaves and bursting buds filled the woodland. Wher- ever a shrub or plant had grown up, that subtle incense was exhaled. The rustling of wings from myriad re- turning minstrels followed the retreat of winter, and a burst of melody ushered in the glorious and triumphant Queen. If we have laid our loved ones to rest in the 'spring- time, it is the season of universal resurrection. Nature is God's unfailing witness; the productions of His skill and wisdom contain much hidden lore, and attest His eternal truth. From death to life, from the cerements of the grave, to the new robe of beauty and unfading luster. The poor Italian girl, the invalid, felt the moving influence.  Lillian had become her daily companion, looking to her for every comfort, for gentle consider- atiop, and more than all, influenced beyond expression by that faith, where light was not hidden, but radiated   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      861 from all her motives and actions. Short walks were ventured in the open air which invigorated her spirits and restored her health. There was an unwonted soft- ness in her voice and manner which added a new charm to other fascinations, hitherto obscured by the fire and ardor of a true Italian nature. - What shall I do without you, my best, my truest friend?"She was weeping silently in the dim shadows of the Spring twilight. "While you remain here, my friendship and care shall never cease!" 'But there are secret intimations of my speedy de- parture." Her words were not clear to Lillian's apprehension; a sort 'of awe filled her mind as she gazed upon the thin and attenuated frame of the beautiful stranger- she mistook her meaning. "You are not going to leave us, Azalie?" ( Yes," she replied; "I am going home to Italy- my Italy; the land of song and romance. I firmly be- lieve my parents will soon be here. They would not write-that would be useless; for a, letter would arrive no sooner than themselves. It is now time that they had come, and truly I can not grieve so much for one whom I have loved as for you, who in toy solitude and bitter repentance and desolation, came to me with words of forgiveness and hea ling--eading my spirit from the base and ignoble to the lofty and pure." She held in her hand a bunch of the woodland violet, which filled the room with their delicate perfumery. "O0," said she,- "if you had ever seen the Alpine violet, beside which, these are insignificant, you could never forget. Lillian, le these recall me to your   ^6^2        .LILLIAN: OR, mind; they are so sad. Although the earliest flowers of spring, the associations clustering about them are filled with sweet and overpowering memories. It is this feeling which influenced the poet and musician to make them their theme. Have you heard the song, breathing of the springtime? The sentiment and music perfectly adapted-fuli of the forest's sacred mysteries-likening the violet to one as fair- and frail; the creature of impulse, of a moment! They sing that song in my native land, and her blue skies and glanc- ing waters impart their ineffable charm with a new and indescribable grace. Yes, Lillian, think of me with the violets." Her friend was weeping too. "But you are not going away from  us as they do. Even if your father and mother come, thev will not take you away. We will make you so happy; and now we understand each other perfectly, and the past is all forgotten and the future hopeful-be contented to re- main!" "No-no; happiness is not here.  I must return to Italy! See, the glorious moon is rising, and it shines too over those I love--whom I have deserted, but who will never desert me. You deserve your good fortune, and I rejoice with you in it. Think -of me with the violets!" The prophecy was soon fulfilled. Signor Constantine and his wife delayed not a mo- ment in embracing the earliest opportunity-departed for America, to seek their wandering child. -Gladly she was restored to their arms, and in accordance with her wishes, returned to Italy, whose bracing air failed to impart new bloom and beauty to her faded life.   THE BATTLE OF LIFE,      363 It was a singular fancy she had indulged, of resting at last beside the hermit's cave amid the mountains; for she believed his spirit hovered there; and that rest ani peace were best attained near one whose life had been full of peace and entire devotion. And so they buried her beneath the shadow of the Alps the Alpine violet and wild rose bloom upon her grave-and a snowy mantel sometimes covers it; and the tears of her bereaved parents fall upon '\ but their undying love makes it beautiful and bright.   364        LILLIAN: OR,  CHAPTER XXIX. "LLIAN, dear Lillian, your promise is redeemed; all this is the result of your faithfulness and unfailing love!" There was no answer; the heart of her to whom these words were addressed overflowed with gratitude and quiet happiness. "Father, give us your blessing?" They knelt together before the venerable and loving parent, those two young brides; their orange wreaths trembled over the long and snowy bridal vails, in the bloom and freshness and grace of youth and immortal love. His hands lightly pressed each bended head, and his words were almost inaudible; but the prayer was still more earnest and effectual. "There is nothing but death can divide us, father, and that not long! You shall live with us in our new and delightful homes!" The old man could not say to them then in their happiness that his time was short, that an unseen hand was beckoning himr away-an invisible presence wait- ing for him even then at the portal. He was too happy, perhaps too happy; excess of joy is somnetimes more difficult to bear than proportional sorrow. The carriages were in waiting to convey them to the Church of the Messiah, where the indissoluble ties. were riveted so lightly, that their pressure was never felt-like bands of flowers. In that very church where Lillian had met her cruel rebuff, and first saw her lovel   THE BATTLE OF LIFE.      365 and husband, the irrevocable vows were breathed-a new and happy life commenced. "Whom God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." Who can say these links are ever broken; the rivets may be loosened--they may fall away with the sound of earth's falling fetters, but they shall be gathered up in the last change that knows no change! Fortune had written her strangest history in the life of Lillian. In the mansion where she had passed so many disturbed nights and wretched- days, she dwelt at last, idolized by the people, appreciated by 'a small circle of faithful axad devoted friends. There was nothing wanting to complete the charm; and #he never forgot those 'who like herself, or as she had done, were striving to rise above the pressure of adverse cir- cumstances, but her hand, heart and means were liber- ally extended to the helpless and suffering. Eva resided in her former home-the residence of Mrs. Carroll-which-they had also been unable to re- tain. Its location pleased the bride, and met with Lillian's earnest approbation, as being near her own. The wealthy-the influential-the aristocratic sought their favor and patronage. Mrs. Floyd was among the number of their earliest visitors, and -it was not in the heart of either to repulse her, because all things had worked together for their good, and their happi- ness did not produce selfishness or sudden exaltation; but their influence extended to the remotest objebts.  The past was not forgotten, but served to enhance the present in its review. Their foundation was sure and unyielding--a house built upon the rock, against   366        LILLIAN: OR, which the tempest may beat and the wild wind blow, but which shall stand forever! Travers did not forsake the cultivation of his beau- tiful art, but fitted up an elegant gallery, which was the chief attraction of their home. And Lillian disproved the statement that poetry is incompatible with wedded felicity. That beautiful gift diffused itself over her new relations, with delightful influence, and its sacred power served to draw her heart from the admiration of the beautiful-which is its concomitant to the Author of all beauty-to the Crea- tor from -his works-preserving alive that transcendent emotion, whose best and purest object is the heavenly-- an artist and a poetess.! Tricilli never regretted his departure from Italy, and no longer desired to return. In the heart of the do- mestic circle he ceased to rove, and the haven of rest was home. We can not tell which mansion was the most tasteful or luxurious. Gems of art and beauty filled every niche and corner, so that each was a bijou, a little paradise, whose chief charm was still and for-, ever-Love! In the communion of the church-under her whole- some teachings-the storm-tossed pilgrims of a brief and transitory existence, found their most acceptable and abiding hope. And while they journey hand in hand, heart to heart, through t]e perishable to the in- corruptsble, their warfare is not ended; for the Chris- tian lays aside his armor only with hishife. The strug- gle is not ended, but each new victory adds anunfading gem to the crown of immortality-their country is the golden- the imperishable.  "Then shall the right- eous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father!"
